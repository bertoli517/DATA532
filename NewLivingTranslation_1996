1 This is a record of the ancestors of
Jesus the Messiah, a descendant of
King David and of Abraham:
2 Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac
was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the
father of Judah and his brothers.
3 Judah was the father of Perez and
Zerah (their mother was Tamar). Perez
was the father of Hezron. Hezron was
the father of Ram.
4 Ram was the father of Amminadab.
Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.
Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
5 Salmon was the father of Boaz (his
mother was Rahab). Boaz was the father
of Obed (his mother was Ruth). Obed
was the father of Jesse.MATTHEW 1
2
6 Jesse was the father of King David.
David was the father of Solomon (his
mother was Bathsheba, the widow of
Uriah).
7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam.
Rehoboam was the father of Abijah.
Abijah was the father of Asaph.
8 Asaph was the father of Jehoshaphat.
Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram.
Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham.
Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was
the father of Hezekiah.
10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh.
Manasseh was the father of Amos. Amos
was the father of Josiah.
11 Josiah was the father of Jehoiachin
and his brothers (born at the me of the
exile to Babylon).
12 A er the Babylonian exile: Jehoiachin
was the father of Sheal el. Sheal el was
the father of Zerubbabel.MATTHEW 1
3
13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim
was the father of Azor.
14 Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok
was the father of Akim. Akim was the
father of Eliud.
15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar.
Eleazar was the father of Ma han.
Ma han was the father of Jacob.
16 Jacob was the father of Joseph, the
husband of Mary. Mary was the mother
of Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
17 All those listed above include
fourteen genera ons from Abraham to
King David, and fourteen from David’s
me to the Babylonian exile, and
fourteen from the Babylonian exile to
the Messiah.
18 Now this is how Jesus the Messiah
was born. His mother, Mary, was
engaged to be married to Joseph. ButMATTHEW 1
4
while she was s ll a virgin, she became
pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
19 Joseph, her ﬁanc‚, being a just man,
decided to break the engagement
quietly, so as not to disgrace her publicly.
20 As he considered this, he fell asleep,
and an angel of the Lord appeared to
him in a dream. "Joseph, son of David,"
the angel said, "do not be afraid to go
ahead with your marriage to Mary. For
the child within her has been conceived
by the Holy Spirit.
21 And she will have a son, and you are
to name him Jesus, for he will save his
people from their sins."
22 All of this happened to fulﬁll the
Lord’s message through his prophet:
23 "Look! The virgin will conceive a
child! She will give birth to a son, and he
will be called Immanuel (meaning, God
is with us)."MATTHEW 1 – 2
5
24 When Joseph woke up, he did what
the angel of the Lord commanded. He
brought Mary home to be his wife,
25 but she remained a virgin un l her
son was born. And Joseph named him
Jesus.
1 Jesus was born in the town of
Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign
of King Herod. About that me some
wise men from eastern lands arrived in
Jerusalem, asking,
2 "Where is the newborn king of the
Jews? We have seen his star as it arose,
and we have come to worship him."
3 Herod was deeply disturbed by their
ques on, as was all of Jerusalem.
4 He called a mee ng of the leading
priests and teachers of religious law.
"Where did the prophets say the
Messiah would be born?" he asked
them.
2MATTHEW 2
6
5 "In Bethlehem," they said, "for this is
what the prophet wrote:
6 ‘O Bethlehem of Judah, you are not
just a lowly village in Judah, for a ruler
will come from you who will be the
shepherd for my people Israel.’"
7 Then Herod sent a private message
to the wise men, asking them to come
see him. At this mee ng he learned the
exact me when they ﬁrst saw the star.
8 Then he told them, "Go to Bethlehem
and search carefully for the child. And
when you ﬁnd him, come back and tell
me so that I can go and worship him,
too!"
9 A er this interview the wise men
went their way. Once again the star
appeared to them, guiding them to
Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and
stopped over the place where the child
was.MATTHEW 2
7
10 When they saw the star, they were
ﬁlled with joy!
11 They entered the house where
the child and his mother, Mary, were,
and they fell down before him and
worshiped him. Then they opened their
treasure chests and gave him gi s of
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
12 But when it was me to leave, they
went home another way, because God
had warned them in a dream not to
return to Herod.
13 A er the wise men were gone, an
angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph
in a dream. "Get up and ﬂee to Egypt
with the child and his mother," the angel
said. "Stay there un l I tell you to return,
because Herod is going to try to kill the
child."
14 That night Joseph le for Egypt with
the child and Mary, his mother,MATTHEW 2
15 and they stayed there un
8
l Herod’s
death. This fulﬁlled what the Lord had
spoken through the prophet: "I called
my Son out of Egypt."
16 Herod was furious when he learned
that the wise men had outwi ed him.
He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and
around Bethlehem who were two years
old and under, because the wise men
had told him the star ﬁrst appeared to
them about two years earlier.
17 Herod’s brutal ac on fulﬁlled the
prophecy of Jeremiah:
18 "A cry of anguish is heard in Ramah–
–weeping and mourning unrestrained.
Rachel weeps for her children, refusing
to be comforted––for they are dead."
19 When Herod died, an angel of the
Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in
Egypt and told him,
20 "Get up and take the child and
his mother back to the land of Israel,MATTHEW 2 – 3
9
because those who were trying to kill
the child are dead."
21 So Joseph returned immediately to
Israel with Jesus and his mother.
22 But when he learned that the new
ruler was Herod’s son Archelaus, he was
afraid. Then, in another dream, he was
warned to go to Galilee.
23 So they went and lived in a town
called Nazareth. This fulﬁlled what was
spoken by the prophets concerning the
Messiah: "He will be called a Nazarene."
1 In those days John the Bap st
began preaching in the Judean
wilderness. His message was,
2 "Turn from your sins and turn to God,
because the Kingdom of Heaven is near."
3 Isaiah had spoken of John when he
said, "He is a voice shou ng in the
wilderness: ‘Prepare a pathway for the
Lord’s coming! Make a straight road for
him!’"
3MATTHEW 3
10
4 John’s clothes were woven from camel
hair, and he wore a leather belt; his food
was locusts and wild honey.
5 People from Jerusalem and from
every sec on of Judea and from all
over the Jordan Valley went out to the
wilderness to hear him preach.
6 And when they confessed their sins,
he bap zed them in the Jordan River.
7 But when he saw many Pharisees
and Sadducees coming to be bap zed,
he denounced them. "You brood of
snakes!" he exclaimed. "Who warned
you to ﬂee God’s coming judgment?
8 Prove by the way you live that you
have really turned from your sins and
turned to God.
9 Don’t just say, ‘We’re safe––we’re the
descendants of Abraham.’ That proves
nothing. God can change these stones
here into children of Abraham.MATTHEW 3
11
10 Even now the ax of God’s judgment
is poised, ready to sever your roots. Yes,
every tree that does not produce good
fruit will be chopped down and thrown
into the ﬁre.
11 "I bap ze with water those who
turn from their sins and turn to God.
But someone is coming soon who is far
greater than I am––so much greater that
I am not even worthy to be his slave. He
will bap ze you with the Holy Spirit and
with ﬁre.
12 He is ready to separate the chaﬀ
from the grain with his winnowing fork.
Then he will clean up the threshing area,
storing the grain in his barn but burning
the chaﬀ with never–ending ﬁre."
13 Then Jesus went from Galilee to the
Jordan River to be bap zed by John.
14 But John didn’t want to bap ze him.
"I am the one who needs to be bap zedMATTHEW 3 – 4
12
by you," he said, "so why are you coming
to me?"
15 But Jesus said, "It must be done,
because we must do everything that is
right." So then John bap zed him.
16 A er his bap sm, as Jesus came
up out of the water, the heavens were
opened and he saw the Spirit of God
descending like a dove and se ling on
him.
17 And a voice from heaven said, "This
is my beloved Son, and I am fully pleased
with him."
1 Then Jesus was led out into the
wilderness by the Holy Spirit to be
tempted there by the Devil.
2 For forty days and forty nights he ate
nothing and became very hungry.
3 Then the Devil came and said to him,
"If you are the Son of God, change these
stones into loaves of bread."
4MATTHEW 4
13
4 But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures
say, ‘People need more than bread for
their life; they must feed on every word
of God.’"
5 Then the Devil took him to Jerusalem,
to the highest point of the Temple,
6 and said, "If you are the Son of God,
jump oﬀ! For the Scriptures say, ‘He
orders his angels to protect you. And
they will hold you with their hands to
keep you from striking your foot on a
stone.’"
7 Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also
say, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’"
8 Next the Devil took him to the peak of
a very high mountain and showed him
the na ons of the world and all their
glory.
9 "I will give it all to you," he said, "if
you will only kneel down and worship
me."MATTHEW 4
14
10 "Get out of here, Satan," Jesus told
him. "For the Scriptures say, ‘You must
worship the Lord your God; serve only
him.’"
11 Then the Devil went away, and angels
came and cared for Jesus.
12 When Jesus heard that John had
been arrested, he le Judea and
returned to Galilee.
13 But instead of going to Nazareth,
he went to Capernaum, beside the Sea
of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and
Naphtali.
14 This fulﬁlled Isaiah’s prophecy:
15 "In the land of Zebulun and of
Naphtali, beside the sea, beyond the
Jordan River––in Galilee where so many
Gen les live––
16 the people who sat in darkness have
seen a great light. And for those who
lived in the land where death casts its
shadow, a light has shined."MATTHEW 4
15
17 From then on, Jesus began to preach,
"Turn from your sins and turn to God,
because the Kingdom of Heaven is near."
18 One day as Jesus was walking along
the shore beside the Sea of Galilee, he
saw two brothers––Simon, also called
Peter, and Andrew––ﬁshing with a net,
for they were commercial ﬁshermen.
19 Jesus called out to them, "Come, be
my disciples, and I will show you how to
ﬁsh for people!"
20 And they le their nets at once and
went with him.
21 A li le farther up the shore he
saw two other brothers, James and
John, si ng in a boat with their father,
Zebedee, mending their nets. And he
called them to come, too.
22 They immediately followed him,
leaving the boat and their father behind.
23 Jesus traveled throughout Galilee
teaching in the synagogues, preachingMATTHEW 4 – 5
16
everywhere the Good News about the
Kingdom. And he healed people who
had every kind of sickness and disease.
24 News about him spread far beyond
the borders of Galilee so that the sick
were soon coming to be healed from
as far away as Syria. And whatever
their illness and pain, or if they
were possessed by demons, or were
epilep cs, or were paralyzed––he healed
them all.
25 Large crowds followed him wherever
he went––people from Galilee, the Ten
Towns, Jerusalem, from all over Judea,
and from east of the Jordan River.
1 One day as the crowds were
gathering, Jesus went up the
mountainside with his disciples and sat
down to teach them.
2 This is what he taught them:
5MATTHEW 5
17
3 "God blesses those who realize their
need for him, for the Kingdom of Heaven
is given to them.
4 God blesses those who mourn, for
they will be comforted.
5 God blesses those who are gentle and
lowly, for the whole earth will belong to
them.
6 God blesses those who are hungry and
thirsty for jus ce, for they will receive it
in full.
7 God blesses those who are merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.
8 God blesses those whose hearts are
pure, for they will see God.
9 God blesses those who work for
peace, for they will be called the children
of God.
10 God blesses those who are
persecuted because they live for God,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.MATTHEW 5
18
11 "God blesses you when you are
mocked and persecuted and lied about
because you are my followers.
12 Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a
great reward awaits you in heaven. And
remember, the ancient prophets were
persecuted, too.
13 "You are the salt of the earth. But
what good is salt if it has lost its ﬂavor?
Can you make it useful again? It will be
thrown out and trampled underfoot as
worthless.
14 You are the light of the world––like a
city on a mountain, glowing in the night
for all to see.
15 Don’t hide your light under a basket!
Instead, put it on a stand and let it shine
for all.
16 In the same way, let your good deeds
shine out for all to see, so that everyone
will praise your heavenly Father.MATTHEW 5
19
17 "Don’t misunderstand why I have
come. I did not come to abolish the law
of Moses or the wri ngs of the prophets.
No, I came to fulﬁll them.
18 I assure you, un l heaven and earth
disappear, even the smallest detail of
God’s law will remain un l its purpose is
achieved.
19 So if you break the smallest
commandment and teach others to do
the same, you will be the least in the
Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who
obeys God’s laws and teaches them will
be great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
20 "But I warn you––unless you obey
God be er than the teachers of religious
law and the Pharisees do, you can’t
enter the Kingdom of Heaven at all!
21 "You have heard that the law of
Moses says, ‘Do not murder. If you
commit murder, you are subject to
judgment.’MATTHEW 5
20
22 But I say, if you are angry with
someone, you are subject to judgment!
If you call someone an idiot, you are in
danger of being brought before the high
council. And if you curse someone, you
are in danger of the ﬁres of hell.
23 "So if you are standing before the
altar in the Temple, oﬀering a sacriﬁce to
God, and you suddenly remember that
someone has something against you,
24 leave your sacriﬁce there beside
the altar. Go and be reconciled to that
person. Then come and oﬀer your
sacriﬁce to God.
25 Come to terms quickly with your
enemy before it is too late and you are
dragged into court, handed over to an
oﬃcer, and thrown in jail.
26 I assure you that you won’t be free
again un l you have paid the last penny.
27 "You have heard that the law of
Moses says, ‘Do not commit adultery.’MATTHEW 5
21
28 But I say, anyone who even looks at
a woman with lust in his eye has already
commi ed adultery with her in his heart.
29 So if your eye––even if it is your good
eye ––causes you to lust, gouge it out
and throw it away. It is be er for you to
lose one part of your body than for your
whole body to be thrown into hell.
30 And if your hand––even if it is your
stronger hand ––causes you to sin, cut it
oﬀ and throw it away. It is be er for you
to lose one part of your body than for
your whole body to be thrown into hell.
31 "You have heard that the law of
Moses says, ‘A man can divorce his wife
by merely giving her a le er of divorce.’
32 But I say that a man who divorces
his wife, unless she has been unfaithful,
causes her to commit adultery. And
anyone who marries a divorced woman
commits adultery.MATTHEW 5
22
33 "Again, you have heard that the law
of Moses says, ‘Do not break your vows;
you must carry out the vows you have
made to the Lord.’
34 But I say, don’t make any vows! If
you say, ‘By heaven!’ it is a sacred vow
because heaven is God’s throne.
35 And if you say, ‘By the earth!’ it
is a sacred vow because the earth is
his footstool. And don’t swear, ‘By
Jerusalem!’ for Jerusalem is the city of
the great King.
36 Don’t even swear, ‘By my head!’ for
you can’t turn one hair white or black.
37 Just say a simple, ‘Yes, I will,’ or
‘No, I won’t.’ Your word is enough. To
strengthen your promise with a vow
shows that something is wrong.
38 "You have heard that the law of
Moses says, ‘If an eye is injured, injure
the eye of the person who did it. If aMATTHEW 5
23
tooth gets knocked out, knock out the
tooth of the person who did it.’
39 But I say, don’t resist an evil person!
If you are slapped on the right cheek,
turn the other, too.
40 If you are ordered to court and your
shirt is taken from you, give your coat,
too.
41 If a soldier demands that you carry
his gear for a mile, carry it two miles.
42 Give to those who ask, and don’t turn
away from those who want to borrow.
43 "You have heard that the law of
Moses says, ‘Love your neighbor’ and
hate your enemy.
44 But I say, love your enemies! Pray for
those who persecute you!
45 In that way, you will be ac ng as true
children of your Father in heaven. For he
gives his sunlight to both the evil and the
good, and he sends rain on the just and
on the unjust, too.MATTHEW 5 – 6
24
46 If you love only those who love you,
what good is that? Even corrupt tax
collectors do that much.
47 If you are kind only to your friends,
how are you diﬀerent from anyone else?
Even pagans do that.
48 But you are to be perfect, even as
your Father in heaven is perfect.
1 "Take care! Don’t do your good
deeds publicly, to be admired,
because then you will lose the reward
from your Father in heaven.
2 When you give a gi to someone
in need, don’t shout about it as the
hypocrites do––blowing trumpets in the
synagogues and streets to call a en on
to their acts of charity! I assure you, they
have received all the reward they will
ever get.
3 But when you give to someone, don’t
tell your le hand what your right hand
is doing.
6MATTHEW 6
4 Give your gi
25
s in secret, and your
Father, who knows all secrets, will
reward you.
5 "And now about prayer. When you
pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who
love to pray publicly on street corners
and in the synagogues where everyone
can see them. I assure you, that is all the
reward they will ever get.
6 But when you pray, go away by
yourself, shut the door behind you,
and pray to your Father secretly. Then
your Father, who knows all secrets, will
reward you.
7 "When you pray, don’t babble on and
on as people of other religions do. They
think their prayers are answered only by
repea ng their words again and again.
8 Don’t be like them, because your
Father knows exactly what you need
even before you ask him!MATTHEW 6
26
9 Pray like this: Our Father in heaven,
may your name be honored.
10 May your Kingdom come soon. May
your will be done here on earth, just as
it is in heaven.
11 Give us our food for today,
12 and forgive us our sins, just as we
have forgiven those who have sinned
against us.
13 And don’t let us yield to tempta on,
but deliver us from the evil one.
14 "If you forgive those who sin against
you, your heavenly Father will forgive
you.
15 But if you refuse to forgive others,
your Father will not forgive your sins.
16 "And when you fast, don’t make it
obvious, as the hypocrites do, who try to
look pale and disheveled so people will
admire them for their fas ng. I assure
you, that is the only reward they will
ever get.MATTHEW 6
27
17 But when you fast, comb your hair
and wash your face.
18 Then no one will suspect you are
fas ng, except your Father, who knows
what you do in secret. And your Father,
who knows all secrets, will reward you.
19 "Don’t store up treasures here on
earth, where they can be eaten by moths
and get rusty, and where thieves break
in and steal.
20 Store your treasures in heaven,
where they will never become moth–
eaten or rusty and where they will be
safe from thieves.
21 Wherever your treasure is, there
your heart and thoughts will also be.
22 "Your eye is a lamp for your body. A
pure eye lets sunshine into your soul.
23 But an evil eye shuts out the light and
plunges you into darkness. If the light
you think you have is really darkness,
how deep that darkness will be!MATTHEW 6
28
24 "No one can serve two masters. For
you will hate one and love the other, or
be devoted to one and despise the other.
You cannot serve both God and money.
25 "So I tell you, don’t worry about
everyday life––whether you have
enough food, drink, and clothes. Doesn’t
life consist of more than food and
clothing?
26 Look at the birds. They don’t need
to plant or harvest or put food in barns
because your heavenly Father feeds
them. And you are far more valuable to
him than they are.
27 Can all your worries add a single
moment to your life? Of course not.
28 "And why worry about your clothes?
Look at the lilies and how they grow.
They don’t work or make their clothing,
29 yet Solomon in all his glory was not
dressed as beau fully as they are.MATTHEW 6 – 7
29
30 And if God cares so wonderfully for
ﬂowers that are here today and gone
tomorrow, won’t he more surely care for
you? You have so li le faith!
31 "So don’t worry about having enough
food or drink or clothing.
32 Why be like the pagans who are so
deeply concerned about these things?
Your heavenly Father already knows all
your needs,
33 and he will give you all you need
from day to day if you live for him and
make the Kingdom of God your primary
concern.
34 "So don’t worry about tomorrow,
for tomorrow will bring its own worries.
Today’s trouble is enough for today.
1 "Stop judging others, and you will
not be judged.
2 For others will treat you as you treat
them. Whatever measure you use in
7MATTHEW 7
30
judging others, it will be used to measure
how you are judged.
3 And why worry about a speck in your
friend’s eye when you have a log in your
own?
4 How can you think of saying, ‘Let me
help you get rid of that speck in your
eye,’ when you can’t see past the log in
your own eye?
5 Hypocrite! First get rid of the log from
your own eye; then perhaps you will see
well enough to deal with the speck in
your friend’s eye.
6 "Don’t give what is holy to unholy
people. Don’t give pearls to swine! They
will trample the pearls, then turn and
a ack you.
7 "Keep on asking, and you will be given
what you ask for. Keep on looking, and
you will ﬁnd. Keep on knocking, and the
door will be opened.MATTHEW 7
31
8 For everyone who asks, receives.
Everyone who seeks, ﬁnds. And the door
is opened to everyone who knocks.
9 You parents––if your children ask for a
loaf of bread, do you give them a stone
instead?
10 Or if they ask for a ﬁsh, do you give
them a snake? Of course not!
11 If you sinful people know how to give
good gi s to your children, how much
more will your heavenly Father give
good gi s to those who ask him.
12 "Do for others what you would like
them to do for you. This is a summary
of all that is taught in the law and the
prophets.
13 "You can enter God’s Kingdom only
through the narrow gate. The highway
to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for
the many who choose the easy way.MATTHEW 7
32
14 But the gateway to life is small, and
the road is narrow, and only a few ever
ﬁnd it.
15 "Beware of false prophets who come
disguised as harmless sheep, but are
really wolves that will tear you apart.
16 You can detect them by the way
they act, just as you can iden fy a tree
by its fruit. You don’t pick grapes from
thornbushes, or ﬁgs from thistles.
17 A healthy tree produces good fruit,
and an unhealthy tree produces bad
fruit.
18 A good tree can’t produce bad fruit,
and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit.
19 So every tree that does not produce
good fruit is chopped down and thrown
into the ﬁre.
20 Yes, the way to iden fy a tree or
a person is by the kind of fruit that is
produced.MATTHEW 7
33
21 "Not all people who sound religious
are really godly. They may refer to me
as ‘Lord,’ but they s ll won’t enter the
Kingdom of Heaven. The decisive issue is
whether they obey my Father in heaven.
22 On judgment day many will tell me,
‘Lord, Lord, we prophesied in your name
and cast out demons in your name and
performed many miracles in your name.’
23 But I will reply, ‘I never knew you.
Go away; the things you did were
unauthorized.’
24 "Anyone who listens to my teaching
and obeys me is wise, like a person who
builds a house on solid rock.
25 Though the rain comes in torrents
and the ﬂoodwaters rise and the
winds beat against that house, it won’t
collapse, because it is built on rock.
26 But anyone who hears my teaching
and ignores it is foolish, like a person
who builds a house on sand.MATTHEW 7 – 8
34
27 When the rains and ﬂoods come and
the winds beat against that house, it will
fall with a mighty crash."
28 A er Jesus ﬁnished speaking, the
crowds were amazed at his teaching,
29 for he taught as one who had real
authority––quite unlike the teachers of
religious law.
1 Large crowds followed Jesus as he
came down the mountainside.
2 Suddenly, a man with leprosy
approached Jesus. He knelt before him,
worshiping. "Lord," the man said, "if you
want to, you can make me well again."
3 Jesus touched him. "I want to," he
said. "Be healed!" And instantly the
leprosy disappeared.
4 Then Jesus said to him, "Go right over
to the priest and let him examine you.
Don’t talk to anyone along the way. Take
along the oﬀering required in the law of
Moses for those who have been healed
8MATTHEW 8
35
of leprosy, so everyone will have proof
of your healing."
5 When Jesus arrived in Capernaum, a
Roman oﬃcer came and pleaded with
him,
6 "Lord, my young servant lies in bed,
paralyzed and racked with pain."
7 Jesus said, "I will come and heal him."
8 Then the oﬃcer said, "Lord, I am not
worthy to have you come into my home.
Just say the word from where you are,
and my servant will be healed!
9 I know, because I am under the
authority of my superior oﬃcers and I
have authority over my soldiers. I only
need to say, ‘Go,’ and they go, or ‘Come,’
and they come. And if I say to my slaves,
‘Do this or that,’ they do it."
10 When Jesus heard this, he was
amazed. Turning to the crowd, he said,
"I tell you the truth, I haven’t seen faith
like this in all the land of Israel!MATTHEW 8
11 And I tell you this, that many Gen
36
les
will come from all over the world and sit
down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob at
the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven.
12 But many Israelites––those for whom
the Kingdom was prepared––will be cast
into outer darkness, where there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth."
13 Then Jesus said to the Roman oﬃcer,
"Go on home. What you have believed
has happened." And the young servant
was healed that same hour.
14 When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house,
Peter’s mother–in–law was in bed with a
high fever.
15 But when Jesus touched her hand,
the fever le her. Then she got up and
prepared a meal for him.
16 That evening many demon–
possessed people were brought to Jesus.
All the spirits ﬂed when he commanded
them to leave; and he healed all the sick.MATTHEW 8
37
17 This fulﬁlled the word of the Lord
through Isaiah, who said, "He took our
sicknesses and removed our diseases."
18 When Jesus no ced how large the
crowd was growing, he instructed his
disciples to cross to the other side of the
lake.
19 Then one of the teachers of religious
law said to him, "Teacher, I will follow
you no ma er where you go!"
20 But Jesus said, "Foxes have dens to
live in, and birds have nests, but I, the
Son of Man, have no home of my own,
not even a place to lay my head."
21 Another of his disciples said, "Lord,
ﬁrst let me return home and bury my
father."
22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me now!
Let those who are spiritually dead care
for their own dead."
23 Then Jesus got into the boat and
started across the lake with his disciples.MATTHEW 8
38
24 Suddenly, a terrible storm came up,
with waves breaking into the boat. But
Jesus was sleeping.
25 The disciples went to him and woke
him up, shou ng, "Lord, save us! We’re
going to drown!"
26 And Jesus answered, "Why are you
afraid? You have so li le faith!" Then
he stood up and rebuked the wind and
waves, and suddenly all was calm.
27 The disciples just sat there in awe.
"Who is this?" they asked themselves.
"Even the wind and waves obey him!"
28 When Jesus arrived on the other side
of the lake in the land of the Gadarenes,
two men who were possessed by
demons met him. They lived in a
cemetery and were so dangerous that
no one could go through that area.
29 They began screaming at him, "Why
are you bothering us, Son of God? YouMATTHEW 8 – 9
39
have no right to torture us before God’s
appointed me!"
30 A large herd of pigs was feeding in
the distance,
31 so the demons begged, "If you cast
us out, send us into that herd of pigs."
32 "All right, go!" Jesus commanded
them. So the demons came out of the
men and entered the pigs, and the whole
herd plunged down the steep hillside
into the lake and drowned in the water.
33 The herdsmen ﬂed to the nearby city,
telling everyone what happened to the
demon–possessed men.
34 The en re town came out to meet
Jesus, but they begged him to go away
and leave them alone.
1 Jesus climbed into a boat and went
back across the lake to his own town.
2 Some people brought to him a
paralyzed man on a mat. Seeing their
9MATTHEW 9
40
faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
"Take heart, son! Your sins are forgiven."
3 "Blasphemy! This man talks like he is
God!" some of the teachers of religious
law said among themselves.
4 Jesus knew what they were thinking,
so he asked them, "Why are you thinking
such evil thoughts?
5 Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are
forgiven’ or ‘Get up and walk’?
6 I will prove that I, the Son of Man,
have the authority on earth to forgive
sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed
man and said, "Stand up, take your
mat, and go on home, because you are
healed!"
7 And the man jumped up and went
home!
8 Fear swept through the crowd as they
saw this happen right before their eyes.
They praised God for sending a man with
such great authority.MATTHEW 9
41
9 As Jesus was going down the road, he
saw Ma hew si ng at his tax–collec on
booth. "Come, be my disciple," Jesus
said to him. So Ma hew got up and
followed him.
10 That night Ma hew invited Jesus
and his disciples to be his dinner guests,
along with his fellow tax collectors and
many other notorious sinners.
11 The Pharisees were indignant. "Why
does your teacher eat with such scum?"
they asked his disciples.
12 When he heard this, Jesus replied,
"Healthy people don’t need a doctor––
sick people do."
13 Then he added, "Now go and learn
the meaning of this Scripture: ‘I want
you to be merciful; I don’t want your
sacriﬁces.’ For I have come to call
sinners, not those who think they are
already good enough."MATTHEW 9
42
14 One day the disciples of John the
Bap st came to Jesus and asked him,
"Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but
your disciples don’t fast?"
15 Jesus responded, "Should the
wedding guests mourn while celebra ng
with the groom? Someday he will be
taken from them, and then they will fast.
16 And who would patch an old garment
with unshrunk cloth? For the patch
shrinks and pulls away from the old
cloth, leaving an even bigger hole than
before.
17 And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins. The old skins would burst
from the pressure, spilling the wine
and ruining the skins. New wine must
be stored in new wineskins. That way
both the wine and the wineskins are
preserved."
18 As Jesus was saying this, the leader
of a synagogue came and knelt downMATTHEW 9
43
before him. "My daughter has just died,"
he said, "but you can bring her back to
life again if you just come and lay your
hand upon her."
19 As Jesus and the disciples were going
to the oﬃcial’s home,
20 a woman who had had a hemorrhage
for twelve years came up behind him.
She touched the fringe of his robe,
21 for she thought, "If I can just touch
his robe, I will be healed."
22 Jesus turned around and said to her,
"Daughter, be encouraged! Your faith
has made you well." And the woman
was healed at that moment.
23 When Jesus arrived at the oﬃcial’s
home, he no ced the noisy crowds and
heard the funeral music.
24 He said, "Go away, for the girl isn’t
dead; she’s only asleep." But the crowd
laughed at him.MATTHEW 9
44
25 When the crowd was ﬁnally outside,
Jesus went in and took the girl by the
hand, and she stood up!
26 The report of this miracle swept
through the en re countryside.
27 A er Jesus le the girl’s home, two
blind men followed along behind him,
shou ng, "Son of David, have mercy on
us!"
28 They went right into the house where
he was staying, and Jesus asked them,
"Do you believe I can make you see?"
"Yes, Lord," they told him, "we do."
29 Then he touched their eyes and said,
"Because of your faith, it will happen."
30 And suddenly they could see! Jesus
sternly warned them, "Don’t tell anyone
about this."
31 But instead, they spread his fame all
over the region.MATTHEW 9
32 When they le
45
, some people brought
to him a man who couldn’t speak
because he was possessed by a demon.
33 So Jesus cast out the demon, and
instantly the man could talk. The crowds
marveled. "Nothing like this has ever
happened in Israel!" they exclaimed.
34 But the Pharisees said, "He can cast
out demons because he is empowered
by the prince of demons."
35 Jesus traveled through all the ci es
and villages of that area, teaching in the
synagogues and announcing the Good
News about the Kingdom. And wherever
he went, he healed people of every sort
of disease and illness.
36 He felt great pity for the crowds that
came, because their problems were so
great and they didn’t know where to go
for help. They were like sheep without a
shepherd.MATTHEW 9 – 10
46
37 He said to his disciples, "The harvest
is so great, but the workers are so few.
38 So pray to the Lord who is in charge
of the harvest; ask him to send out more
workers for his ﬁelds."
1 Jesus called his twelve disciples
to him and gave them authority
to cast out evil spirits and to heal every
kind of disease and illness.
2 Here are the names of the twelve
apostles: ﬁrst Simon (also called Peter),
then Andrew (Peter’s brother), James
(son of Zebedee), John (James’s brother),
3 Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas,
Ma hew (the tax collector), James (son
of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus,
4 Simon (the Zealot), Judas Iscariot
(who later betrayed him).
5 Jesus sent the twelve disciples out
with these instruc ons: "Don’t go to the
Gen les or the Samaritans,
10MATTHEW 10
47
6 but only to the people of Israel––God’s
lost sheep.
7 Go and announce to them that the
Kingdom of Heaven is near.
8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure
those with leprosy, and cast out demons.
Give as freely as you have received!
9 "Don’t take any money with you.
10 Don’t carry a traveler’s bag with an
extra coat and sandals or even a walking
s ck. Don’t hesitate to accept hospitality,
because those who work deserve to be
fed.
11 Whenever you enter a city or village,
search for a worthy man and stay in his
home un l you leave for the next town.
12 When you are invited into someone’s
home, give it your blessing.
13 If it turns out to be a worthy home,
let your blessing stand; if it is not, take
back the blessing.MATTHEW 10
48
14 If a village doesn’t welcome you or
listen to you, shake oﬀ the dust of that
place from your feet as you leave.
15 I assure you, the wicked ci es of
Sodom and Gomorrah will be be er oﬀ
on the judgment day than that place will
be.
16 "Look, I am sending you out as sheep
among wolves. Be as wary as snakes and
harmless as doves.
17 But beware! For you will be handed
over to the courts and beaten in the
synagogues.
18 And you must stand trial before
governors and kings because you are my
followers. This will be your opportunity
to tell them about me––yes, to witness
to the world.
19 When you are arrested, don’t worry
about what to say in your defense,
because you will be given the right
words at the right me.MATTHEW 10
49
20 For it won’t be you doing the
talking––it will be the Spirit of your
Father speaking through you.
21 "Brother will betray brother to death,
fathers will betray their own children,
and children will rise against their
parents and cause them to be killed.
22 And everyone will hate you because
of your allegiance to me. But those who
endure to the end will be saved.
23 When you are persecuted in one
town, ﬂee to the next. I assure you that
I, the Son of Man, will return before you
have reached all the towns of Israel.
24 "A student is not greater than the
teacher. A servant is not greater than the
master.
25 The student shares the teacher’s fate.
The servant shares the master’s fate.
And since I, the master of the household,
have been called the prince of demons,MATTHEW 10
50
how much more will it happen to you,
the members of the household!
26 But don’t be afraid of those who
threaten you. For the me is coming
when everything will be revealed; all
that is secret will be made public.
27 What I tell you now in the darkness,
shout abroad when daybreak comes.
What I whisper in your ears, shout from
the housetops for all to hear!
28 "Don’t be afraid of those who want
to kill you. They can only kill your body;
they cannot touch your soul. Fear only
God, who can destroy both soul and
body in hell.
29 Not even a sparrow, worth only half
a penny, can fall to the ground without
your Father knowing it.
30 And the very hairs on your head are
all numbered.MATTHEW 10
51
31 So don’t be afraid; you are more
valuable to him than a whole ﬂock of
sparrows.
32 "If anyone acknowledges me publicly
here on earth, I will openly acknowledge
that person before my Father in heaven.
33 But if anyone denies me here on
earth, I will deny that person before my
Father in heaven.
34 "Don’t imagine that I came to bring
peace to the earth! No, I came to bring a
sword.
35 I have come to set a man against
his father, and a daughter against her
mother, and a daughter–in–law against
her mother–in–law.
36 Your enemies will be right in your
own household!
37 If you love your father or mother
more than you love me, you are not
worthy of being mine; or if you love yourMATTHEW 10
52
son or daughter more than me, you are
not worthy of being mine.
38 If you refuse to take up your cross
and follow me, you are not worthy of
being mine.
39 If you cling to your life, you will lose
it; but if you give it up for me, you will
ﬁnd it.
40 "Anyone who welcomes you is
welcoming me, and anyone who
welcomes me is welcoming the Father
who sent me.
41 If you welcome a prophet as one
who speaks for God, you will receive
the same reward a prophet gets. And
if you welcome good and godly people
because of their godliness, you will be
given a reward like theirs.
42 And if you give even a cup of cold
water to one of the least of my followers,
you will surely be rewarded."MATTHEW 11
11
53
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished giving
these instruc ons to his twelve
disciples, he went oﬀ teaching and
preaching in towns throughout the
country.
2 John the Bap st, who was now in
prison, heard about all the things the
Messiah was doing. So he sent his
disciples to ask Jesus,
3 "Are you really the Messiah we’ve
been wai ng for, or should we keep
looking for someone else?"
4 Jesus told them, "Go back to John and
tell him about what you have heard and
seen––
5 the blind see, the lame walk, the
lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead
are raised to life, and the Good News is
being preached to the poor.
6 And tell him: ‘God blesses those who
are not oﬀended by me.’"MATTHEW 11
54
7 When John’s disciples had gone, Jesus
began talking about him to the crowds.
"Who is this man in the wilderness that
you went out to see? Did you ﬁnd him
weak as a reed, moved by every breath
of wind?
8 Or were you expec ng to see a man
dressed in expensive clothes? Those
who dress like that live in palaces, not
out in the wilderness.
9 Were you looking for a prophet? Yes,
and he is more than a prophet.
10 John is the man to whom the
Scriptures refer when they say, ‘Look, I
am sending my messenger before you,
and he will prepare your way before
you.’
11 "I assure you, of all who have ever
lived, none is greater than John the
Bap st. Yet even the most insigniﬁcant
person in the Kingdom of Heaven is
greater than he is!MATTHEW 11
12 And from the
55
me John the Bap st
began preaching and bap zing un l
now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been
forcefully advancing, and violent people
a ack it.
13 For before John came, all the
teachings of the Scriptures looked
forward to this present me.
14 And if you are willing to accept what
I say, he is Elijah, the one the prophets
said would come.
15 Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen and understand!
16 "How shall I describe this genera on?
These people are like a group of children
playing a game in the public square.
They complain to their friends,
17 ‘We played wedding songs, and you
weren’t happy, so we played funeral
songs, but you weren’t sad.’MATTHEW 11
18 For John the Bap
56
st didn’t drink wine
and he o en fasted, and you say, ‘He’s
demon possessed.’
19 And I, the Son of Man, feast and
drink, and you say, ‘He’s a glu on and a
drunkard, and a friend of the worst sort
of sinners!’ But wisdom is shown to be
right by what results from it."
20 Then Jesus began to denounce the
ci es where he had done most of his
miracles, because they hadn’t turned
from their sins and turned to God.
21 "What horrors await you, Korazin
and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did
in you had been done in wicked Tyre
and Sidon, their people would have sat
in deep repentance long ago, clothed in
sackcloth and throwing ashes on their
heads to show their remorse.
22 I assure you, Tyre and Sidon will be
be er oﬀ on the judgment day than you!MATTHEW 11
57
23 And you people of Capernaum, will
you be exalted to heaven? No, you will
be brought down to the place of the
dead. For if the miracles I did for you had
been done in Sodom, it would s ll be
here today.
24 I assure you, Sodom will be be er oﬀ
on the judgment day than you."
25 Then Jesus prayed this prayer: "O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank
you for hiding the truth from those who
think themselves so wise and clever, and
for revealing it to the childlike.
26 Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it
this way!
27 "My Father has given me authority
over everything. No one really knows
the Son except the Father, and no one
really knows the Father except the Son
and those to whom the Son chooses to
reveal him."MATTHEW 11 – 12
58
28 Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all
of you who are weary and carry heavy
burdens, and I will give you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach
you, because I am humble and gentle,
and you will ﬁnd rest for your souls.
30 For my yoke ﬁts perfectly, and the
burden I give you is light."
1 At about that me Jesus was
walking through some grainﬁelds
on the Sabbath. His disciples were
hungry, so they began breaking oﬀ heads
of wheat and ea ng the grain.
2 Some Pharisees saw them do it and
protested, "Your disciples shouldn’t be
doing that! It’s against the law to work
by harves ng grain on the Sabbath."
3 But Jesus said to them, "Haven’t you
ever read in the Scriptures what King
David did when he and his companions
were hungry?
12MATTHEW 12
59
4 He went into the house of God, and
they ate the special bread reserved for
the priests alone. That was breaking the
law, too.
5 And haven’t you ever read in the law
of Moses that the priests on duty in the
Temple may work on the Sabbath?
6 I tell you, there is one here who is
even greater than the Temple!
7 But you would not have condemned
those who aren’t guilty if you knew the
meaning of this Scripture: ‘I want you to
be merciful; I don’t want your sacriﬁces.’
8 For I, the Son of Man, am master even
of the Sabbath."
9 Then he went over to the synagogue,
10 where he no ced a man with a
deformed hand. The Pharisees asked
Jesus, "Is it legal to work by healing on
the Sabbath day?" (They were, of course,
hoping he would say yes, so they could
bring charges against him.)MATTHEW 12
60
11 And he answered, "If you had one
sheep, and it fell into a well on the
Sabbath, wouldn’t you get to work and
pull it out? Of course you would.
12 And how much more valuable is a
person than a sheep! Yes, it is right to do
good on the Sabbath."
13 Then he said to the man, "Reach out
your hand." The man reached out his
hand, and it became normal, just like the
other one.
14 Then the Pharisees called a mee ng
and discussed plans for killing Jesus.
15 But Jesus knew what they were
planning. He le that area, and many
people followed him. He healed all the
sick among them,
16 but he warned them not to say who
he was.
17 This fulﬁlled the prophecy of Isaiah
concerning him:MATTHEW 12
61
18 "Look at my Servant, whom I have
chosen. He is my Beloved, and I am very
pleased with him. I will put my Spirit
upon him, and he will proclaim jus ce to
the na ons.
19 He will not ﬁght or shout; he will not
raise his voice in public.
20 He will not crush those who are
weak, or quench the smallest hope, un l
he brings full jus ce with his ﬁnal victory.
21 And his name will be the hope of all
the world."
22 Then a demon–possessed man, who
was both blind and unable to talk, was
brought to Jesus. He healed the man so
that he could both speak and see.
23 The crowd was amazed. "Could it
be that Jesus is the Son of David, the
Messiah?" they wondered out loud.
24 But when the Pharisees heard about
the miracle, they said, "No wonder heMATTHEW 12
62
can cast out demons. He gets his power
from Satan, the prince of demons."
25 Jesus knew their thoughts and
replied, "Any kingdom at war with itself
is doomed. A city or home divided
against itself is doomed.
26 And if Satan is cas ng out Satan,
he is ﬁgh ng against himself. His own
kingdom will not survive.
27 And if I am empowered by the
prince of demons, what about your own
followers? They cast out demons, too,
so they will judge you for what you have
said.
28 But if I am cas ng out demons by the
Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God
has arrived among you.
29 Let me illustrate this. You can’t
enter a strong man’s house and rob him
without ﬁrst tying him up. Only then can
his house be robbed!MATTHEW 12
63
30 Anyone who isn’t helping me
opposes me, and anyone who isn’t
working with me is actually working
against me.
31 "Every sin or blasphemy can be
forgiven––except blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit, which can never be forgiven.
32 Anyone who blasphemes against me,
the Son of Man, can be forgiven, but
blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will
never be forgiven, either in this world or
in the world to come.
33 "A tree is iden ﬁed by its fruit. Make
a tree good, and its fruit will be good.
Make a tree bad, and its fruit will be bad.
34 You brood of snakes! How could
evil men like you speak what is good
and right? For whatever is in your heart
determines what you say.
35 A good person produces good words
from a good heart, and an evil person
produces evil words from an evil heart.MATTHEW 12
64
36 And I tell you this, that you must give
an account on judgment day of every
idle word you speak.
37 The words you say now reﬂect your
fate then; either you will be jus ﬁed by
them or you will be condemned."
38 One day some teachers of religious
law and Pharisees came to Jesus and
said, "Teacher, we want you to show us
a miraculous sign to prove that you are
from God."
39 But Jesus replied, "Only an evil,
faithless genera on would ask for a
miraculous sign; but the only sign I will
give them is the sign of the prophet
Jonah.
40 For as Jonah was in the belly of
the great ﬁsh for three days and three
nights, so I, the Son of Man, will be in
the heart of the earth for three days and
three nights.MATTHEW 12
65
41 The people of Nineveh will rise up
against this genera on on judgment
day and condemn it, because they
repented at the preaching of Jonah.
And now someone greater than Jonah is
here––and you refuse to repent.
42 The queen of Sheba will also rise up
against this genera on on judgment
day and condemn it, because she came
from a distant land to hear the wisdom
of Solomon. And now someone greater
than Solomon is here––and you refuse
to listen to him.
43 "When an evil spirit leaves a person,
it goes into the desert, seeking rest but
ﬁnding none.
44 Then it says, ‘I will return to the
person I came from.’ So it returns and
ﬁnds its former home empty, swept, and
clean.
45 Then the spirit ﬁnds seven other
spirits more evil than itself, and they allMATTHEW 12 – 13
66
enter the person and live there. And so
that person is worse oﬀ than before.
That will be the experience of this evil
genera on."
46 As Jesus was speaking to the crowd,
his mother and brothers were outside,
wan ng to talk with him.
47 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother
and your brothers are outside, and they
want to speak to you."
48 Jesus asked, "Who is my mother?
Who are my brothers?"
49 Then he pointed to his disciples
and said, "These are my mother and
brothers.
50 Anyone who does the will of my
Father in heaven is my brother and sister
and mother!"
1 Later that same day, Jesus le
the house and went down to the
shore,
13MATTHEW 13
67
2 where an immense crowd soon
gathered. He got into a boat, where he
sat and taught as the people listened on
the shore.
3 He told many stories such as this one:
"A farmer went out to plant some seed.
4 As he sca ered it across his ﬁeld,
some seeds fell on a footpath, and the
birds came and ate them.
5 Other seeds fell on shallow soil with
underlying rock. The plants sprang up
quickly,
6 but they soon wilted beneath the hot
sun and died because the roots had no
nourishment in the shallow soil.
7 Other seeds fell among thorns that
shot up and choked out the tender
blades.
8 But some seeds fell on fer le soil and
produced a crop that was thirty, sixty,
and even a hundred mes as much as
had been planted.MATTHEW 13
68
9 Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen and understand!"
10 His disciples came and asked him,
"Why do you always tell stories when
you talk to the people?"
11 Then he explained to them, "You
have been permi ed to understand the
secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but
others have not.
12 To those who are open to my
teaching, more understanding will be
given, and they will have an abundance
of knowledge. But to those who are not
listening, even what they have will be
taken away from them.
13 That is why I tell these stories,
because people see what I do, but they
don’t really see. They hear what I say,
but they don’t really hear, and they don’t
understand.
14 This fulﬁlls the prophecy of Isaiah,
which says: ‘You will hear my words, butMATTHEW 13
69
you will not understand; you will see
what I do, but you will not perceive its
meaning.
15 For the hearts of these people are
hardened, and their ears cannot hear,
and they have closed their eyes––so
their eyes cannot see, and their ears
cannot hear, and their hearts cannot
understand, and they cannot turn to me
and let me heal them.’
16 "But blessed are your eyes, because
they see; and your ears, because they
hear.
17 I assure you, many prophets and
godly people have longed to see and
hear what you have seen and heard, but
they could not.
18 "Now here is the explana on of the
story I told about the farmer sowing
grain:
19 The seed that fell on the hard path
represents those who hear the GoodMATTHEW 13
70
News about the Kingdom and don’t
understand it. Then the evil one comes
and snatches the seed away from their
hearts.
20 The rocky soil represents those who
hear the message and receive it with joy.
21 But like young plants in such soil,
their roots don’t go very deep. At ﬁrst
they get along ﬁne, but they wilt as soon
as they have problems or are persecuted
because they believe the word.
22 The thorny ground represents those
who hear and accept the Good News,
but all too quickly the message is
crowded out by the cares of this life
and the lure of wealth, so no crop is
produced.
23 The good soil represents the hearts
of those who truly accept God’s message
and produce a huge harvest––thirty,
sixty, or even a hundred mes as much
as had been planted."MATTHEW 13
71
24 Here is another story Jesus told: "The
Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who
planted good seed in his ﬁeld.
25 But that night as everyone slept, his
enemy came and planted weeds among
the wheat.
26 When the crop began to grow and
produce grain, the weeds also grew.
27 The farmer’s servants came and told
him, ‘Sir, the ﬁeld where you planted
that good seed is full of weeds!’
28 "‘An enemy has done it!’ the farmer
exclaimed. "‘Shall we pull out the
weeds?’ they asked.
29 "He replied, ‘No, you’ll hurt the
wheat if you do.
30 Let both grow together un l the
harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to
sort out the weeds and burn them and
to put the wheat in the barn.’"MATTHEW 13
31 Here is another illustra
72
on Jesus
used: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a
mustard seed planted in a ﬁeld.
32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but it
becomes the largest of garden plants
and grows into a tree where birds can
come and ﬁnd shelter in its branches."
33 Jesus also used this illustra on: "The
Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast used by
a woman making bread. Even though she
used a large amount of ﬂour, the yeast
permeated every part of the dough."
34 Jesus always used stories and
illustra ons like these when speaking to
the crowds. In fact, he never spoke to
them without using such parables.
35 This fulﬁlled the prophecy that said,
"I will speak to you in parables. I will
explain mysteries hidden since the
crea on of the world."
36 Then, leaving the crowds outside,
Jesus went into the house. His disciplesMATTHEW 13
73
said, "Please explain the story of the
weeds in the ﬁeld."
37 "All right," he said. "I, the Son of
Man, am the farmer who plants the
good seed.
38 The ﬁeld is the world, and the good
seed represents the people of the
Kingdom. The weeds are the people who
belong to the evil one.
39 The enemy who planted the weeds
among the wheat is the Devil. The
harvest is the end of the world, and the
harvesters are the angels.
40 "Just as the weeds are separated out
and burned, so it will be at the end of
the world.
41 I, the Son of Man, will send my
angels, and they will remove from my
Kingdom everything that causes sin and
all who do evil,MATTHEW 13
74
42 and they will throw them into the
furnace and burn them. There will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.
43 Then the godly will shine like the
sun in their Father’s Kingdom. Anyone
who is willing to hear should listen and
understand!
44 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a
treasure that a man discovered hidden
in a ﬁeld. In his excitement, he hid it
again and sold everything he owned to
get enough money to buy the ﬁeld––and
to get the treasure, too!
45 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is
like a pearl merchant on the lookout for
choice pearls.
46 When he discovered a pearl of great
value, he sold everything he owned and
bought it!
47 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is
like a ﬁshing net that is thrown into the
water and gathers ﬁsh of every kind.MATTHEW 13
75
48 When the net is full, they drag it up
onto the shore, sit down, sort the good
ﬁsh into crates, and throw the bad ones
away.
49 That is the way it will be at the end
of the world. The angels will come and
separate the wicked people from the
godly,
50 throwing the wicked into the ﬁre.
There will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.
51 Do you understand?" "Yes," they
said, "we do."
52 Then he added, "Every teacher of
religious law who has become a disciple
in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a person
who brings out of the storehouse the
new teachings as well as the old."
53 When Jesus had ﬁnished telling these
stories, he le that part of the country.
54 He returned to Nazareth, his
hometown. When he taught there in theMATTHEW 13 – 14
76
synagogue, everyone was astonished
and said, "Where does he get his wisdom
and his miracles?
55 He’s just a carpenter’s son, and
we know Mary, his mother, and his
brothers––James, Joseph, Simon, and
Judas.
56 All his sisters live right here among
us. What makes him so great?"
57 And they were deeply oﬀended and
refused to believe in him. Then Jesus told
them, "A prophet is honored everywhere
except in his own hometown and among
his own family."
58 And so he did only a few miracles
there because of their unbelief.
1 When Herod An pas heard
about Jesus,
2 he said to his advisers, "This must be
John the Bap st come back to life again!
That is why he can do such miracles."
14MATTHEW 14
77
3 For Herod had arrested and
imprisoned John as a favor to his wife
Herodias (the former wife of Herod’s
brother Philip).
4 John kept telling Herod, "It is illegal
for you to marry her."
5 Herod would have executed John, but
he was afraid of a riot, because all the
people believed John was a prophet.
6 But at a birthday party for Herod,
Herodias’s daughter performed a dance
that greatly pleased him,
7 so he promised with an oath to give
her anything she wanted.
8 At her mother’s urging, the girl asked,
"I want the head of John the Bap st on a
tray!"
9 The king was sorry, but because of his
oath and because he didn’t want to back
down in front of his guests, he issued
the necessary orders.
10 So John was beheaded in the prison,MATTHEW 14
78
11 and his head was brought on a tray
and given to the girl, who took it to her
mother.
12 John’s disciples came for his body
and buried it. Then they told Jesus what
had happened.
13 As soon as Jesus heard the news, he
went oﬀ by himself in a boat to a remote
area to be alone. But the crowds heard
where he was headed and followed by
land from many villages.
14 A vast crowd was there as he stepped
from the boat, and he had compassion
on them and healed their sick.
15 That evening the disciples came to
him and said, "This is a desolate place,
and it is ge ng late. Send the crowds
away so they can go to the villages and
buy food for themselves."
16 But Jesus replied, "That isn’t
necessary––you feed them."MATTHEW 14
79
17 "Impossible!" they exclaimed. "We
have only ﬁve loaves of bread and two
ﬁsh!"
18 "Bring them here," he said.
19 Then he told the people to sit down
on the grass. And he took the ﬁve loaves
and two ﬁsh, looked up toward heaven,
and asked God’s blessing on the food.
Breaking the loaves into pieces, he gave
some of the bread and ﬁsh to each
disciple, and the disciples gave them to
the people.
20 They all ate as much as they wanted,
and they picked up twelve baskets of
le overs.
21 About ﬁve thousand men had eaten
from those ﬁve loaves, in addi on to all
the women and children!
22 Immediately a er this, Jesus made
his disciples get back into the boat and
cross to the other side of the lake while
he sent the people home.MATTHEW 14
23 A
80
erward he went up into the hills
by himself to pray. Night fell while he
was there alone.
24 Meanwhile, the disciples were in
trouble far away from land, for a strong
wind had risen, and they were ﬁgh ng
heavy waves.
25 About three o’clock in the morning
Jesus came to them, walking on the
water.
26 When the disciples saw him, they
screamed in terror, thinking he was a
ghost.
27 But Jesus spoke to them at once. "It’s
all right," he said. "I am here! Don’t be
afraid."
28 Then Peter called to him, "Lord, if
it’s really you, tell me to come to you by
walking on water."
29 "All right, come," Jesus said. So Peter
went over the side of the boat and
walked on the water toward Jesus.MATTHEW 14
81
30 But when he looked around at the
high waves, he was terriﬁed and began
to sink. "Save me, Lord!" he shouted.
31 Instantly Jesus reached out his hand
and grabbed him. "You don’t have much
faith," Jesus said. "Why did you doubt
me?"
32 And when they climbed back into the
boat, the wind stopped.
33 Then the disciples worshiped him.
"You really are the Son of God!" they
exclaimed.
34 A er they had crossed the lake, they
landed at Gennesaret.
35 The news of their arrival spread
quickly throughout the whole
surrounding area, and soon people were
bringing all their sick to be healed.
36 The sick begged him to let them
touch even the fringe of his robe, and all
who touched it were healed.MATTHEW 15
15
82
1 Some Pharisees and teachers
of religious law now arrived from
Jerusalem to interview Jesus.
2 "Why do your disciples disobey our
age–old tradi ons?" they demanded.
"They ignore our tradi on of ceremonial
hand washing before they eat."
3 Jesus replied, "And why do you,
by your tradi ons, violate the direct
commandments of God?
4 For instance, God says, ‘Honor your
father and mother,’ and ‘Anyone who
speaks evil of father or mother must be
put to death.’
5 But you say, ‘You don’t need to honor
your parents by caring for their needs if
you give the money to God instead.’
6 And so, by your own tradi on, you
nullify the direct commandment of God.
7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was
prophesying about you when he
said,MATTHEW 15
83
8 ‘These people honor me with their
lips, but their hearts are far away.
9 Their worship is a farce, for they
replace God’s commands with their own
man–made teachings.’"
10 Then Jesus called to the crowds and
said, "Listen to what I say and try to
understand.
11 You are not deﬁled by what you eat;
you are deﬁled by what you say and do."
12 Then the disciples came to him and
asked, "Do you realize you oﬀended the
Pharisees by what you just said?"
13 Jesus replied, "Every plant not
planted by my heavenly Father will be
rooted up,
14 so ignore them. They are blind guides
leading the blind, and if one blind person
guides another, they will both fall into a
ditch."MATTHEW 15
84
15 Then Peter asked Jesus, "Explain
what you meant when you said people
aren’t deﬁled by what they eat."
16 "Don’t you understand?" Jesus asked
him.
17 "Anything you eat passes through the
stomach and then goes out of the body.
18 But evil words come from an evil
heart and deﬁle the person who says
them.
19 For from the heart come evil
thoughts, murder, adultery, all other
sexual immorality, the , lying, and
slander.
20 These are what deﬁle you. Ea ng
with unwashed hands could never deﬁle
you and make you unacceptable to
God!"
21 Jesus then le Galilee and went
north to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
22 A Gen le woman who lived there
came to him, pleading, "Have mercyMATTHEW 15
85
on me, O Lord, Son of David! For my
daughter has a demon in her, and it is
severely tormen ng her."
23 But Jesus gave her no reply––not
even a word. Then his disciples urged
him to send her away. "Tell her to leave,"
they said. "She is bothering us with all
her begging."
24 Then he said to the woman, "I
was sent only to help the people of
Israel––God’s lost sheep––not the
Gen les."
25 But she came and worshiped him and
pleaded again, "Lord, help me!"
26 "It isn’t right to take food from the
children and throw it to the dogs," he
said.
27 "Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even
dogs are permi ed to eat crumbs that
fall beneath their master’s table."MATTHEW 15
86
28 "Woman," Jesus said to her, "your
faith is great. Your request is granted."
And her daughter was instantly healed.
29 Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee
and climbed a hill and sat down.
30 A vast crowd brought him the lame,
blind, crippled, mute, and many others
with physical diﬃcul es, and they laid
them before Jesus. And he healed them
all.
31 The crowd was amazed! Those who
hadn’t been able to speak were talking,
the crippled were made well, the lame
were walking around, and those who
had been blind could see again! And
they praised the God of Israel.
32 Then Jesus called his disciples to him
and said, "I feel sorry for these people.
They have been here with me for three
days, and they have nothing le to eat.
I don’t want to send them away hungry,
or they will faint along the road."MATTHEW 15
87
33 The disciples replied, "And where
would we get enough food out here in
the wilderness for all of them to eat?"
34 Jesus asked, "How many loaves
of bread do you have?" They replied,
"Seven, and a few small ﬁsh."
35 So Jesus told all the people to sit
down on the ground.
36 Then he took the seven loaves and
the ﬁsh, thanked God for them, broke
them into pieces, and gave them to the
disciples, who distributed the food to
the crowd.
37 They all ate un l they were full, and
when the scraps were picked up, there
were seven large baskets of food le
over!
38 There were four thousand men who
were fed that day, in addi on to all the
women and children.MATTHEW 15 – 16
88
39 Then Jesus sent the people home,
and he got into a boat and crossed over
to the region of Magadan.
1 One day the Pharisees and
Sadducees came to test Jesus’
claims by asking him to show them a
miraculous sign from heaven.
2 He replied, "You know the saying,
‘Red sky at night means fair weather
tomorrow,
3 red sky in the morning means foul
weather all day.’ You are good at reading
the weather signs in the sky, but you
can’t read the obvious signs of the mes!
4 Only an evil, faithless genera on
would ask for a miraculous sign, but
the only sign I will give them is the sign
of the prophet Jonah." Then Jesus le
them and went away.
5 Later, a er they crossed to the other
side of the lake, the disciples discovered
they had forgo en to bring any food.
16MATTHEW 16
89
6 "Watch out!" Jesus warned them.
"Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees
and Sadducees."
7 They decided he was saying this
because they hadn’t brought any bread.
8 Jesus knew what they were thinking,
so he said, "You have so li le faith! Why
are you worried about having no food?
9 Won’t you ever understand? Don’t
you remember the ﬁve thousand I fed
with ﬁve loaves, and the baskets of food
that were le over?
10 Don’t you remember the four
thousand I fed with seven loaves, with
baskets of food le over?
11 How could you even think I was
talking about food? So again I say,
‘Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees
and Sadducees.’"
12 Then at last they understood that he
wasn’t speaking about yeast or breadMATTHEW 16
90
but about the false teaching of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.
13 When Jesus came to the region of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
"Who do people say that the Son of Man
is?"
14 "Well," they replied, "some say
John the Bap st, some say Elijah, and
others say Jeremiah or one of the other
prophets."
15 Then he asked them, "Who do you
say I am?"
16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the
Messiah, the Son of the living God."
17 Jesus replied, "You are blessed,
Simon son of John, because my Father in
heaven has revealed this to you. You did
not learn this from any human being.
18 Now I say to you that you are Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my church,
and all the powers of hell will not
conquer it.MATTHEW 16
91
19 And I will give you the keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you lock
on earth will be locked in heaven, and
whatever you open on earth will be
opened in heaven."
20 Then he sternly warned them not to
tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
21 From then on Jesus began to tell his
disciples plainly that he had to go to
Jerusalem, and he told them what would
happen to him there. He would suﬀer at
the hands of the leaders and the leading
priests and the teachers of religious law.
He would be killed, and he would be
raised on the third day.
22 But Peter took him aside and
corrected him. "Heaven forbid, Lord," he
said. "This will never happen to you!"
23 Jesus turned to Peter and said,
"Get away from me, Satan! You are a
dangerous trap to me. You are seeingMATTHEW 16
92
things merely from a human point of
view, and not from God’s."
24 Then Jesus said to the disciples, "If
any of you wants to be my follower, you
must put aside your selﬁsh ambi on,
shoulder your cross, and follow me.
25 If you try to keep your life for yourself,
you will lose it. But if you give up your
life for me, you will ﬁnd true life.
26 And how do you beneﬁt if you gain
the whole world but lose your own soul
in the process? Is anything worth more
than your soul?
27 For I, the Son of Man, will come in
the glory of my Father with his angels
and will judge all people according to
their deeds.
28 And I assure you that some of you
standing here right now will not die
before you see me, the Son of Man,
coming in my Kingdom."MATTHEW 17
17
93
1 Six days later Jesus took Peter
and the two brothers, James and
John, and led them up a high mountain.
2 As the men watched, Jesus’
appearance changed so that his face
shone like the sun, and his clothing
became dazzling white.
3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared
and began talking with Jesus.
4 Peter blurted out, "Lord, this is
wonderful! If you want me to, I’ll make
three shrines, one for you, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah."
5 But even as he said it, a bright cloud
came over them, and a voice from the
cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, and
I am fully pleased with him. Listen to
him."
6 The disciples were terriﬁed and fell
face down on the ground.
7 Jesus came over and touched them.
"Get up," he said, "don’t be afraid."MATTHEW 17
94
8 And when they looked, they saw only
Jesus with them.
9 As they descended the mountain,
Jesus commanded them, "Don’t tell
anyone what you have seen un l I, the
Son of Man, have been raised from the
dead."
10 His disciples asked, "Why do the
teachers of religious law insist that Elijah
must return before the Messiah comes?"
11 Jesus replied, "Elijah is indeed coming
ﬁrst to set everything in order.
12 But I tell you, he has already come,
but he wasn’t recognized, and he was
badly mistreated. And soon the Son of
Man will also suﬀer at their hands."
13 Then the disciples realized he had
been speaking of John the Bap st.
14 When they arrived at the foot of the
mountain, a huge crowd was wai ng
for them. A man came and knelt before
Jesus and said,MATTHEW 17
95
15 "Lord, have mercy on my son,
because he has seizures and suﬀers
terribly. He o en falls into the ﬁre or into
the water.
16 So I brought him to your disciples,
but they couldn’t heal him."
17 Jesus replied, "You stubborn, faithless
people! How long must I be with you
un l you believe? How long must I put
up with you? Bring the boy to me."
18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the
boy, and it le him. From that moment
the boy was well.
19 A erward the disciples asked Jesus
privately, "Why couldn’t we cast out that
demon?"
20 "You didn’t have enough faith," Jesus
told them. "I assure you, even if you
had faith as small as a mustard seed
you could say to this mountain, ‘Move
from here to there,’ and it would move.
Nothing would be impossible."MATTHEW 17
96
21 [[EMPTY]]
22 One day a
er they had returned to
Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of
Man is going to be betrayed.
23 He will be killed, but three days later
he will be raised from the dead." And the
disciples’ hearts were ﬁlled with grief.
24 On their arrival in Capernaum, the
tax collectors for the Temple tax came
to Peter and asked him, "Doesn’t your
teacher pay the Temple tax?"
25 "Of course he does," Peter replied.
Then he went into the house to talk
to Jesus about it. But before he had a
chance to speak, Jesus asked him, "What
do you think, Peter? Do kings tax their
own people or the foreigners they have
conquered?"
26 "They tax the foreigners," Peter
replied. "Well, then," Jesus said, "the
ci zens are free!MATTHEW 17 – 18
97
27 However, we don’t want to oﬀend
them, so go down to the lake and throw
in a line. Open the mouth of the ﬁrst ﬁsh
you catch, and you will ﬁnd a coin. Take
the coin and pay the tax for both of us."
1 About that me the disciples
came to Jesus and asked, "Which
of us is greatest in the Kingdom of
Heaven?"
2 Jesus called a small child over to him
and put the child among them.
3 Then he said, "I assure you, unless
you turn from your sins and become as
li le children, you will never get into the
Kingdom of Heaven.
4 Therefore, anyone who becomes as
humble as this li le child is the greatest
in the Kingdom of Heaven.
5 And anyone who welcomes a li le
child like this on my behalf is welcoming
me.
18MATTHEW 18
98
6 But if anyone causes one of these
li le ones who trusts in me to lose faith,
it would be be er for that person to
be thrown into the sea with a large
millstone ed around the neck.
7 "How terrible it will be for anyone
who causes others to sin. Tempta on to
do wrong is inevitable, but how terrible
it will be for the person who does the
temp ng.
8 So if your hand or foot causes you
to sin, cut it oﬀ and throw it away.
It is be er to enter heaven crippled
or lame than to be thrown into the
unquenchable ﬁre with both of your
hands and feet.
9 And if your eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out and throw it away. It is
be er to enter heaven half blind than to
have two eyes and be thrown into hell.
10 "Beware that you don’t despise a
single one of these li le ones. For IMATTHEW 18
99
tell you that in heaven their angels are
always in the presence of my heavenly
Father.
11 [[EMPTY]]
12 "If a shepherd has one hundred
sheep, and one wanders away and is
lost, what will he do? Won’t he leave the
ninety–nine others and go out into the
hills to search for the lost one?
13 And if he ﬁnds it, he will surely rejoice
over it more than over the ninety–nine
that didn’t wander away!
14 In the same way, it is not my heavenly
Father’s will that even one of these li le
ones should perish.
15 "If another believer sins against you,
go privately and point out the fault. If
the other person listens and confesses
it, you have won that person back.
16 But if you are unsuccessful, take one
or two others with you and go backMATTHEW 18
100
again, so that everything you say may be
conﬁrmed by two or three witnesses.
17 If that person s ll refuses to listen,
take your case to the church. If the
church decides you are right, but the
other person won’t accept it, treat
that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax
collector.
18 I tell you this: Whatever you prohibit
on earth is prohibited in heaven, and
whatever you allow on earth is allowed
in heaven.
19 "I also tell you this: If two of you
agree down here on earth concerning
anything you ask, my Father in heaven
will do it for you.
20 For where two or three gather
together because they are mine, I am
there among them."
21 Then Peter came to him and asked,
"Lord, how o en should I forgiveMATTHEW 18
101
someone who sins against me? Seven
mes?"
22 "No!" Jesus replied, "seventy mes
seven!
23 "For this reason, the Kingdom of
Heaven can be compared to a king who
decided to bring his accounts up to date
with servants who had borrowed money
from him.
24 In the process, one of his debtors
was brought in who owed him millions
of dollars.
25 He couldn’t pay, so the king ordered
that he, his wife, his children, and
everything he had be sold to pay the
debt.
26 But the man fell down before the
king and begged him, ‘Oh, sir, be pa ent
with me, and I will pay it all.’
27 Then the king was ﬁlled with pity for
him, and he released him and forgave
his debt.MATTHEW 18
28 "But when the man le
102
the king, he
went to a fellow servant who owed him
a few thousand dollars. He grabbed him
by the throat and demanded instant
payment.
29 His fellow servant fell down before
him and begged for a li le more me.
‘Be pa ent and I will pay it,’ he pleaded.
30 But his creditor wouldn’t wait. He
had the man arrested and jailed un l the
debt could be paid in full.
31 "When some of the other servants
saw this, they were very upset. They
went to the king and told him what had
happened.
32 Then the king called in the man he
had forgiven and said, ‘You evil servant!
I forgave you that tremendous debt
because you pleaded with me.
33 Shouldn’t you have mercy on your
fellow servant, just as I had mercy on
you?’MATTHEW 18 – 19
103
34 Then the angry king sent the man to
prison un l he had paid every penny.
35 "That’s what my heavenly Father will
do to you if you refuse to forgive your
brothers and sisters in your heart."
1 A er Jesus had ﬁnished saying
these things, he le Galilee and
went southward to the region of Judea
and into the area east of the Jordan
River.
2 Vast crowds followed him there, and
he healed their sick.
3 Some Pharisees came and tried to
trap him with this ques on: "Should a
man be allowed to divorce his wife for
any reason?"
4 "Haven’t you read the Scriptures?"
Jesus replied. "They record that from the
beginning ‘God made them male and
female.’
5 And he said, ‘This explains why a
man leaves his father and mother and
19MATTHEW 19
104
is joined to his wife, and the two are
united into one.’
6 Since they are no longer two but one,
let no one separate them, for God has
joined them together."
7 "Then why did Moses say a man could
merely write an oﬃcial le er of divorce
and send her away?" they asked.
8 Jesus replied, "Moses permi ed
divorce as a concession to your hard–
hearted wickedness, but it was not what
God had originally intended.
9 And I tell you this, a man who divorces
his wife and marries another commits
adultery––unless his wife has been
unfaithful."
10 Jesus’ disciples then said to him,
"Then it is be er not to marry!"
11 "Not everyone can accept this
statement," Jesus said. "Only those
whom God helps.MATTHEW 19
105
12 Some are born as eunuchs, some
have been made that way by others, and
some choose not to marry for the sake
of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone
who can, accept this statement."
13 Some children were brought to Jesus
so he could lay his hands on them and
pray for them. The disciples told them
not to bother him.
14 But Jesus said, "Let the children
come to me. Don’t stop them! For the
Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as
these."
15 And he put his hands on their heads
and blessed them before he le .
16 Someone came to Jesus with this
ques on: "Teacher, what good things
must I do to have eternal life?"
17 "Why ask me about what is good?"
Jesus replied. "Only God is good. But
to answer your ques on, you canMATTHEW 19
106
receive eternal life if you keep the
commandments."
18 "Which ones?" the man asked. And
Jesus replied: "‘Do not murder. Do not
commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not
tes fy falsely.
19 Honor your father and mother. Love
your neighbor as yourself.’"
20 "I’ve obeyed all these
commandments," the young man
replied. "What else must I do?"
21 Jesus told him, "If you want to be
perfect, go and sell all you have and give
the money to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then come, follow
me."
22 But when the young man heard this,
he went sadly away because he had
many possessions.
23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I
tell you the truth, it is very hard for aMATTHEW 19
107
rich person to get into the Kingdom of
Heaven.
24 I say it again––it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of
God!"
25 The disciples were astounded. "Then
who in the world can be saved?" they
asked.
26 Jesus looked at them intently and
said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible.
But with God everything is possible."
27 Then Peter said to him, "We’ve given
up everything to follow you. What will
we get out of it?"
28 And Jesus replied, "I assure you that
when I, the Son of Man, sit upon my
glorious throne in the Kingdom, you who
have been my followers will also sit on
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel.MATTHEW 19 – 20
108
29 And everyone who has given up
houses or brothers or sisters or father
or mother or children or property, for
my sake, will receive a hundred mes as
much in return and will have eternal life.
30 But many who seem to be important
now will be the least important then,
and those who are considered least here
will be the greatest then.
1 "For the Kingdom of Heaven
is like the owner of an estate
who went out early one morning to hire
workers for his vineyard.
2 He agreed to pay the normal daily
wage and sent them out to work.
3 "At nine o’clock in the morning he was
passing through the marketplace and
saw some people standing around doing
nothing.
4 So he hired them, telling them he
would pay them whatever was right at
the end of the day.
20MATTHEW 20
109
5 At noon and again around three
o’clock he did the same thing.
6 At ﬁve o’clock that evening he was in
town again and saw some more people
standing around. He asked them, ‘Why
haven’t you been working today?’
7 "They replied, ‘Because no one hired
us.’ "The owner of the estate told them,
‘Then go on out and join the others in
my vineyard.’
8 "That evening he told the foreman
to call the workers in and pay them,
beginning with the last workers ﬁrst.
9 When those hired at ﬁve o’clock were
paid, each received a full day’s wage.
10 When those hired earlier came to
get their pay, they assumed they would
receive more. But they, too, were paid a
day’s wage.
11 When they received their pay, they
protested,MATTHEW 20
110
12 ‘Those people worked only one hour,
and yet you’ve paid them just as much
as you paid us who worked all day in the
scorching heat.’
13 "He answered one of them, ‘Friend, I
haven’t been unfair! Didn’t you agree to
work all day for the usual wage?
14 Take it and go. I wanted to pay this
last worker the same as you.
15 Is it against the law for me to do what
I want with my money? Should you be
angry because I am kind?’
16 "And so it is, that many who are ﬁrst
now will be last then; and those who are
last now will be ﬁrst then."
17 As Jesus was on the way to
Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples
aside privately and told them what was
going to happen to him.
18 "When we get to Jerusalem," he said,
"the Son of Man will be betrayed to
the leading priests and the teachers ofMATTHEW 20
111
religious law. They will sentence him to
die.
19 Then they will hand him over to the
Romans to be mocked, whipped, and
cruciﬁed. But on the third day he will be
raised from the dead."
20 Then the mother of James and John,
the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus with
her sons. She knelt respec ully to ask a
favor.
21 "What is your request?" he asked.
She replied, "In your Kingdom, will you
let my two sons sit in places of honor
next to you, one at your right and the
other at your le ?"
22 But Jesus told them, "You don’t know
what you are asking! Are you able to
drink from the bi er cup of sorrow I am
about to drink?" "Oh yes," they replied,
"we are able!"
23 "You will indeed drink from it," he
told them. "But I have no right to sayMATTHEW 20
112
who will sit on the thrones next to mine.
My Father has prepared those places for
the ones he has chosen."
24 When the ten other disciples heard
what James and John had asked, they
were indignant.
25 But Jesus called them together and
said, "You know that in this world kings
are tyrants, and oﬃcials lord it over the
people beneath them.
26 But among you it should be quite
diﬀerent. Whoever wants to be a leader
among you must be your servant,
27 and whoever wants to be ﬁrst must
become your slave.
28 For even I, the Son of Man, came
here not to be served but to serve
others, and to give my life as a ransom
for many."
29 As Jesus and the disciples le the
city of Jericho, a huge crowd followed
behind.MATTHEW 20 – 21
30 Two blind men were si
113
ng beside
the road. When they heard that Jesus
was coming that way, they began
shou ng, "Lord, Son of David, have
mercy on us!"
31 The crowd told them to be quiet, but
they only shouted louder, "Lord, Son of
David, have mercy on us!"
32 Jesus stopped in the road and called,
"What do you want me to do for you?"
33 "Lord," they said, "we want to see!"
34 Jesus felt sorry for them and touched
their eyes. Instantly they could see! Then
they followed him.
1 As Jesus and the disciples
approached Jerusalem, they
came to the town of Bethphage on the
Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them
on ahead.
2 "Go into the village over there," he
said, "and you will see a donkey ed
21MATTHEW 21
114
there, with its colt beside it. Un e them
and bring them here.
3 If anyone asks what you are doing,
just say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he
will immediately send them."
4 This was done to fulﬁll the prophecy,
5 "Tell the people of Israel, ‘Look, your
King is coming to you. He is humble,
riding on a donkey––even on a donkey’s
colt.’"
6 The two disciples did as Jesus said.
7 They brought the animals to him and
threw their garments over the colt, and
he sat on it.
8 Most of the crowd spread their coats
on the road ahead of Jesus, and others
cut branches from the trees and spread
them on the road.
9 He was in the center of the procession,
and the crowds all around him were
shou ng, "Praise God for the Son of
David! Bless the one who comes in theMATTHEW 21
115
name of the Lord! Praise God in highest
heaven!"
10 The en re city of Jerusalem was
s rred as he entered. "Who is this?"
they asked.
11 And the crowds replied, "It’s Jesus,
the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
12 Jesus entered the Temple and began
to drive out the merchants and their
customers. He knocked over the tables
of the money changers and the stalls of
those selling doves.
13 He said, "The Scriptures declare, ‘My
Temple will be called a place of prayer,’
but you have turned it into a den of
thieves!"
14 The blind and the lame came to him,
and he healed them there in the Temple.
15 The leading priests and the teachers
of religious law saw these wonderful
miracles and heard even the li le
children in the Temple shou ng, "PraiseMATTHEW 21
116
God for the Son of David." But they were
indignant
16 and asked Jesus, "Do you hear what
these children are saying?" "Yes," Jesus
replied. "Haven’t you ever read the
Scriptures? For they say, ‘You have
taught children and infants to give you
praise.’"
17 Then he returned to Bethany, where
he stayed overnight.
18 In the morning, as Jesus was
returning to Jerusalem, he was hungry,
19 and he no ced a ﬁg tree beside the
road. He went over to see if there were
any ﬁgs on it, but there were only leaves.
Then he said to it, "May you never bear
fruit again!" And immediately the ﬁg
tree withered up.
20 The disciples were amazed when
they saw this and asked, "How did the
ﬁg tree wither so quickly?"MATTHEW 21
117
21 Then Jesus told them, "I assure you,
if you have faith and don’t doubt, you
can do things like this and much more.
You can even say to this mountain, ‘May
God li you up and throw you into the
sea,’ and it will happen.
22 If you believe, you will receive
whatever you ask for in prayer."
23 When Jesus returned to the Temple
and began teaching, the leading priests
and other leaders came up to him. They
demanded, "By whose authority did
you drive out the merchants from the
Temple? Who gave you such authority?"
24 "I’ll tell you who gave me the
authority to do these things if you
answer one ques on," Jesus replied.
25 "Did John’s bap sm come from
heaven or was it merely human?" They
talked it over among themselves. "If we
say it was from heaven, he will ask why
we didn’t believe him.MATTHEW 21
118
26 But if we say it was merely human,
we’ll be mobbed, because the people
think he was a prophet."
27 So they ﬁnally replied, "We don’t
know." And Jesus responded, "Then I
won’t answer your ques on either.
28 "But what do you think about this? A
man with two sons told the older boy,
‘Son, go out and work in the vineyard
today.’
29 The son answered, ‘No, I won’t go,’
but later he changed his mind and went
anyway.
30 Then the father told the other son,
‘You go,’ and he said, ‘Yes, sir, I will.’ But
he didn’t go.
31 Which of the two was obeying
his father?" They replied, "The ﬁrst,
of course." Then Jesus explained his
meaning: "I assure you, corrupt tax
collectors and pros tutes will get into
the Kingdom of God before you do.MATTHEW 21
32 For John the Bap
119
st came and
showed you the way to life, and you
didn’t believe him, while tax collectors
and pros tutes did. And even when you
saw this happening, you refused to turn
from your sins and believe him.
33 "Now listen to this story. A certain
landowner planted a vineyard, built a
wall around it, dug a pit for pressing
out the grape juice, and built a lookout
tower. Then he leased the vineyard to
tenant farmers and moved to another
country.
34 At the me of the grape harvest he
sent his servants to collect his share of
the crop.
35 But the farmers grabbed his servants,
beat one, killed one, and stoned another.
36 So the landowner sent a larger group
of his servants to collect for him, but the
results were the same.MATTHEW 21
120
37 "Finally, the owner sent his son,
thinking, ‘Surely they will respect my
son.’
38 "But when the farmers saw his son
coming, they said to one another, ‘Here
comes the heir to this estate. Come
on, let’s kill him and get the estate for
ourselves!’
39 So they grabbed him, took him out of
the vineyard, and murdered him.
40 "When the owner of the vineyard
returns," Jesus asked, "what do you
think he will do to those farmers?"
41 The religious leaders replied, "He will
put the wicked men to a horrible death
and lease the vineyard to others who
will give him his share of the crop a er
each harvest."
42 Then Jesus asked them, "Didn’t you
ever read this in the Scriptures? ‘The
stone rejected by the builders has nowMATTHEW 21 – 22
121
become the cornerstone. This is the
Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous to see.’
43 What I mean is that the Kingdom of
God will be taken away from you and
given to a na on that will produce the
proper fruit.
44 Anyone who stumbles over that
stone will be broken to pieces, and it will
crush anyone on whom it falls."
45 When the leading priests and
Pharisees heard Jesus, they realized he
was poin ng at them––that they were
the farmers in his story.
46 They wanted to arrest him, but they
were afraid to try because the crowds
considered Jesus to be a prophet.
1 Jesus told them several other
stories to illustrate the Kingdom.
He said,
2 "The Kingdom of Heaven can be
illustrated by the story of a king who
22MATTHEW 22
122
prepared a great wedding feast for his
son.
3 Many guests were invited, and when
the banquet was ready, he sent his
servants to no fy everyone that it was
me to come. But they all refused!
4 So he sent other servants to tell them,
‘The feast has been prepared, and choice
meats have been cooked. Everything is
ready. Hurry!’
5 But the guests he had invited ignored
them and went about their business,
one to his farm, another to his store.
6 Others seized his messengers and
treated them shamefully, even killing
some of them.
7 "Then the king became furious.
He sent out his army to destroy the
murderers and burn their city.
8 And he said to his servants, ‘The
wedding feast is ready, and the guests I
invited aren’t worthy of the honor.MATTHEW 22
123
9 Now go out to the street corners and
invite everyone you see.’
10 "So the servants brought in everyone
they could ﬁnd, good and bad alike, and
the banquet hall was ﬁlled with guests.
11 But when the king came in to meet
the guests, he no ced a man who
wasn’t wearing the proper clothes for a
wedding.
12 ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how is it that you
are here without wedding clothes?’ And
the man had no reply.
13 Then the king said to his aides, ‘Bind
him hand and foot and throw him out
into the outer darkness, where there is
weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
14 For many are called, but few are
chosen."
15 Then the Pharisees met together to
think of a way to trap Jesus into saying
something for which they could accuse
him.MATTHEW 22
124
16 They decided to send some of their
disciples, along with the supporters
of Herod, to ask him this ques on:
"Teacher, we know how honest you
are. You teach about the way of God
regardless of the consequences. You are
impar al and don’t play favorites.
17 Now tell us what you think about
this: Is it right to pay taxes to the Roman
government or not?"
18 But Jesus knew their evil mo ves.
"You hypocrites!" he said. "Whom
are you trying to fool with your trick
ques ons?
19 Here, show me the Roman coin used
for the tax." When they handed him the
coin,
20 he asked, "Whose picture and tle
are stamped on it?"
21 "Caesar’s," they replied. "Well, then,"
he said, "give to Caesar what belongs toMATTHEW 22
125
him. But everything that belongs to God
must be given to God."
22 His reply amazed them, and they
went away.
23 That same day some Sadducees
stepped forward––a group of Jews who
say there is no resurrec on a er death.
They posed this ques on:
24 "Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies
without children, his brother should
marry the widow and have a child who
will be the brother’s heir.’
25 Well, there were seven brothers. The
oldest married and then died without
children, so the second brother married
the widow.
26 This brother also died without
children, and the wife was married to
the next brother, and so on un l she had
been the wife of each of them.
27 And then she also died.MATTHEW 22
126
28 So tell us, whose wife will she be in
the resurrec on? For she was the wife of
all seven of them!"
29 Jesus replied, "Your problem is that
you don’t know the Scriptures, and you
don’t know the power of God.
30 For when the dead rise, they won’t
be married. They will be like the angels
in heaven.
31 But now, as to whether there will be
a resurrec on of the dead––haven’t you
ever read about this in the Scriptures?
Long a er Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
had died, God said,
32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ So he is
the God of the living, not the dead."
33 When the crowds heard him, they
were impressed with his teaching.
34 But when the Pharisees heard that
he had silenced the Sadducees with hisMATTHEW 22
127
reply, they thought up a fresh ques on
of their own to ask him.
35 One of them, an expert in religious
law, tried to trap him with this ques on:
36 "Teacher, which is the most important
commandment in the law of Moses?"
37 Jesus replied, "‘You must love the
Lord your God with all your heart, all
your soul, and all your mind.’
38 This is the ﬁrst and greatest
commandment.
39 A second is equally important: ‘Love
your neighbor as yourself.’
40 All the other commandments and all
the demands of the prophets are based
on these two commandments."
41 Then, surrounded by the Pharisees,
Jesus asked them a ques on:
42 "What do you think about the
Messiah? Whose son is he?" They
replied, "He is the son of David."MATTHEW 22 – 23
128
43 Jesus responded, "Then why does
David, speaking under the inspira on of
the Holy Spirit, call him Lord? For David
said,
44 ‘The LORD said to my Lord, Sit in
honor at my right hand un l I humble
your enemies beneath your feet.’
45 Since David called him Lord, how can
he be his son at the same me?"
46 No one could answer him. And a er
that, no one dared to ask him any more
ques ons.
1 Then Jesus said to the crowds
and to his disciples,
2 "The teachers of religious law and the
Pharisees are the oﬃcial interpreters of
the Scriptures.
3 So prac ce and obey whatever
they say to you, but don’t follow their
example. For they don’t prac ce what
they teach.
23MATTHEW 23
129
4 They crush you with impossible
religious demands and never li a ﬁnger
to help ease the burden.
5 "Everything they do is for show. On
their arms they wear extra wide prayer
boxes with Scripture verses inside, and
they wear extra long tassels on their
robes.
6 And how they love to sit at the head
table at banquets and in the most
prominent seats in the synagogue!
7 They enjoy the a en on they get on
the streets, and they enjoy being called
‘Rabbi.’
8 Don’t ever let anyone call you ‘Rabbi,’
for you have only one teacher, and all of
you are on the same level as brothers
and sisters.
9 And don’t address anyone here on
earth as ‘Father,’ for only God in heaven
is your spiritual Father.MATTHEW 23
130
10 And don’t let anyone call you
‘Master,’ for there is only one master,
the Messiah.
11 The greatest among you must be a
servant.
12 But those who exalt themselves will
be humbled, and those who humble
themselves will be exalted.
13 "How terrible it will be for you
teachers of religious law and you
Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you won’t let
others enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
and you won’t go in yourselves.
14 [[EMPTY]]
15 Yes, how terrible it will be for
you teachers of religious law and you
Pharisees. For you cross land and sea to
make one convert, and then you turn
him into twice the son of hell as you
yourselves are.
16 "Blind guides! How terrible it will
be for you! For you say that it meansMATTHEW 23
131
nothing to swear ‘by God’s Temple’––you
can break that oath. But then you say
that it is binding to swear ‘by the gold in
the Temple.’
17 Blind fools! Which is greater, the
gold, or the Temple that makes the gold
sacred?
18 And you say that to take an oath ‘by
the altar’ can be broken, but to swear
‘by the gi s on the altar’ is binding!
19 How blind! For which is greater, the
gi on the altar, or the altar that makes
the gi sacred?
20 When you swear ‘by the altar,’ you
are swearing by it and by everything on
it.
21 And when you swear ‘by the Temple,’
you are swearing by it and by God, who
lives in it.
22 And when you swear ‘by heaven,’
you are swearing by the throne of God
and by God, who sits on the throne.MATTHEW 23
132
23 "How terrible it will be for you
teachers of religious law and you
Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are
careful to the even the niest part
of your income, but you ignore the
important things of the law––jus ce,
mercy, and faith. You should the, yes,
but you should not leave undone the
more important things.
24 Blind guides! You strain your water so
you won’t accidentally swallow a gnat;
then you swallow a camel!
25 "How terrible it will be for you
teachers of religious law and you
Pharisees. Hypocrites! You are so careful
to clean the outside of the cup and the
dish, but inside you are ﬁlthy––full of
greed and self–indulgence!
26 Blind Pharisees! First wash the inside
of the cup, and then the outside will
become clean, too.MATTHEW 23
133
27 "How terrible it will be for you
teachers of religious law and you
Pharisees. Hypocrites! You are like
whitewashed tombs––beau ful on the
outside but ﬁlled on the inside with dead
people’s bones and all sorts of impurity.
28 You try to look like upright people
outwardly, but inside your hearts are
ﬁlled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.
29 "How terrible it will be for you
teachers of religious law and you
Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you build
tombs for the prophets your ancestors
killed and decorate the graves of the
godly people your ancestors destroyed.
30 Then you say, ‘We never would have
joined them in killing the prophets.’
31 "In saying that, you are accusing
yourselves of being the descendants of
those who murdered the prophets.
32 Go ahead. Finish what they started.MATTHEW 23
134
33 Snakes! Sons of vipers! How will you
escape the judgment of hell?
34 I will send you prophets and wise
men and teachers of religious law. You
will kill some by cruciﬁxion and whip
others in your synagogues, chasing them
from city to city.
35 As a result, you will become guilty
of murdering all the godly people from
righteous Abel to Zechariah son of
Barachiah, whom you murdered in
the Temple between the altar and the
sanctuary.
36 I assure you, all the accumulated
judgment of the centuries will break
upon the heads of this very genera on.
37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city
that kills the prophets and stones God’s
messengers! How o en I have wanted to
gather your children together as a hen
protects her chicks beneath her wings,
but you wouldn’t let me.MATTHEW 23 – 24
38 And now look, your house is le
135
to
you, empty and desolate.
39 For I tell you this, you will never see
me again un l you say, ‘Bless the one
who comes in the name of the Lord!’"
1 As Jesus was leaving the Temple
grounds, his disciples pointed out
to him the various Temple buildings.
2 But he told them, "Do you see all
these buildings? I assure you, they will
be so completely demolished that not
one stone will be le on top of another!"
3 Later, Jesus sat on the slopes of the
Mount of Olives. His disciples came to
him privately and asked, "When will all
this take place? And will there be any
sign ahead of me to signal your return
and the end of the world?"
4 Jesus told them, "Don’t let anyone
mislead you.
24MATTHEW 24
136
5 For many will come in my name,
saying, ‘I am the Messiah.’ They will lead
many astray.
6 And wars will break out near and
far, but don’t panic. Yes, these things
must come, but the end won’t follow
immediately.
7 The na ons and kingdoms will
proclaim war against each other, and
there will be famines and earthquakes in
many parts of the world.
8 But all this will be only the beginning
of the horrors to come.
9 "Then you will be arrested,
persecuted, and killed. You will be hated
all over the world because of your
allegiance to me.
10 And many will turn away from me
and betray and hate each other.
11 And many false prophets will appear
and will lead many people astray.MATTHEW 24
137
12 Sin will be rampant everywhere, and
the love of many will grow cold.
13 But those who endure to the end will
be saved.
14 And the Good News about the
Kingdom will be preached throughout
the whole world, so that all na ons will
hear it; and then, ﬁnally, the end will
come.
15 "The me will come when you will
see what Daniel the prophet spoke
about: the sacrilegious object that
causes desecra on standing in the Holy
Place"––reader, pay a en on!
16 "Then those in Judea must ﬂee to the
hills.
17 A person outside the house must not
go inside to pack.
18 A person in the ﬁeld must not return
even to get a coat.MATTHEW 24
138
19 How terrible it will be for pregnant
women and for mothers nursing their
babies in those days.
20 And pray that your ﬂight will not be
in winter or on the Sabbath.
21 For that will be a me of greater
horror than anything the world has ever
seen or will ever see again.
22 In fact, unless that me of calamity is
shortened, the en re human race will be
destroyed. But it will be shortened for
the sake of God’s chosen ones.
23 "Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here
is the Messiah,’ or ‘There he is,’ don’t
pay any a en on.
24 For false messiahs and false prophets
will rise up and perform great miraculous
signs and wonders so as to deceive, if
possible, even God’s chosen ones.
25 See, I have warned you.
26 "So if someone tells you, ‘Look, the
Messiah is out in the desert,’ don’tMATTHEW 24
139
bother to go and look. Or, ‘Look, he is
hiding here,’ don’t believe it!
27 For as the lightning lights up the
en re sky, so it will be when the Son of
Man comes.
28 Just as the gathering of vultures
shows there is a carcass nearby, so these
signs indicate that the end is near.
29 "Immediately a er those horrible
days end, the sun will be darkened, the
moon will not give light, the stars will fall
from the sky, and the powers of heaven
will be shaken.
30 And then at last, the sign of the
coming of the Son of Man will appear
in the heavens, and there will be deep
mourning among all the na ons of the
earth. And they will see the Son of Man
arrive on the clouds of heaven with
power and great glory.
31 And he will send forth his angels with
the sound of a mighty trumpet blast,MATTHEW 24
140
and they will gather together his chosen
ones from the farthest ends of the earth
and heaven.
32 "Now learn a lesson from the ﬁg
tree. When its buds become tender and
its leaves begin to sprout, you know
without being told that summer is near.
33 Just so, when you see the events I’ve
described beginning to happen, you can
know his return is very near, right at the
door.
34 I assure you, this genera on will not
pass from the scene before all these
things take place.
35 Heaven and earth will disappear, but
my words will remain forever.
36 "However, no one knows the day or
the hour when these things will happen,
not even the angels in heaven or the Son
himself. Only the Father knows.
37 "When the Son of Man returns, it will
be like it was in Noah’s day.MATTHEW 24
141
38 In those days before the Flood, the
people were enjoying banquets and
par es and weddings right up to the
me Noah entered his boat.
39 People didn’t realize what was going
to happen un l the Flood came and
swept them all away. That is the way it
will be when the Son of Man comes.
40 "Two men will be working together
in the ﬁeld; one will be taken, the other
le .
41 Two women will be grinding ﬂour at
the mill; one will be taken, the other le .
42 So be prepared, because you don’t
know what day your Lord is coming.
43 "Know this: A homeowner who knew
exactly when a burglar was coming
would stay alert and not permit the
house to be broken into.
44 You also must be ready all the me.
For the Son of Man will come when least
expected.MATTHEW 24 – 25
142
45 "Who is a faithful, sensible servant,
to whom the master can give the
responsibility of managing his household
and feeding his family?
46 If the master returns and ﬁnds that
the servant has done a good job, there
will be a reward.
47 I assure you, the master will put that
servant in charge of all he owns.
48 But if the servant is evil and thinks,
‘My master won’t be back for a while,’
49 and begins oppressing the other
servants, partying, and ge ng drunk––
50 well, the master will return
unannounced and unexpected.
51 He will tear the servant apart and
banish him with the hypocrites. In that
place there will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.
1 "The Kingdom of Heaven can
be illustrated by the story of ten
25MATTHEW 25
143
bridesmaids who took their lamps and
went to meet the bridegroom.
2 Five of them were foolish, and ﬁve
were wise.
3 The ﬁve who were foolish took no oil
for their lamps,
4 but the other ﬁve were wise enough
to take along extra oil.
5 When the bridegroom was delayed,
they all lay down and slept.
6 At midnight they were roused by the
shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is coming!
Come out and welcome him!’
7 "All the bridesmaids got up and
prepared their lamps.
8 Then the ﬁve foolish ones asked the
others, ‘Please give us some of your oil
because our lamps are going out.’
9 But the others replied, ‘We don’t have
enough for all of us. Go to a shop and
buy some for yourselves.’MATTHEW 25
144
10 "But while they were gone to buy
oil, the bridegroom came, and those
who were ready went in with him to the
marriage feast, and the door was locked.
11 Later, when the other ﬁve
bridesmaids returned, they stood
outside, calling, ‘Sir, open the door for
us!’
12 But he called back, ‘I don’t know
you!’
13 "So stay awake and be prepared,
because you do not know the day or
hour of my return.
14 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven can
be illustrated by the story of a man going
on a trip. He called together his servants
and gave them money to invest for him
while he was gone.
15 He gave ﬁve bags of gold to one, two
bags of gold to another, and one bag of
gold to the last––dividing it in propor onMATTHEW 25
145
to their abili es––and then le on his
trip.
16 The servant who received the ﬁve
bags of gold began immediately to invest
the money and soon doubled it.
17 The servant with two bags of gold
also went right to work and doubled the
money.
18 But the servant who received the one
bag of gold dug a hole in the ground and
hid the master’s money for safekeeping.
19 "A er a long me their master
returned from his trip and called them
to give an account of how they had used
his money.
20 The servant to whom he had
entrusted the ﬁve bags of gold said, ‘Sir,
you gave me ﬁve bags of gold to invest,
and I have doubled the amount.’
21 The master was full of praise. ‘Well
done, my good and faithful servant. You
have been faithful in handling this smallMATTHEW 25
146
amount, so now I will give you many
more responsibili es. Let’s celebrate
together!’
22 "Next came the servant who had
received the two bags of gold, with the
report, ‘Sir, you gave me two bags of
gold to invest, and I have doubled the
amount.’
23 The master said, ‘Well done, my
good and faithful servant. You have
been faithful in handling this small
amount, so now I will give you many
more responsibili es. Let’s celebrate
together!’
24 "Then the servant with the one bag
of gold came and said, ‘Sir, I know you
are a hard man, harves ng crops you
didn’t plant and gathering crops you
didn’t cul vate.
25 I was afraid I would lose your money,
so I hid it in the earth and here it is.’MATTHEW 25
147
26 "But the master replied, ‘You wicked
and lazy servant! You think I’m a hard
man, do you, harves ng crops I didn’t
plant and gathering crops I didn’t
cul vate?
27 Well, you should at least have put
my money into the bank so I could have
some interest.
28 Take the money from this servant
and give it to the one with the ten bags
of gold.
29 To those who use well what they are
given, even more will be given, and they
will have an abundance. But from those
who are unfaithful, even what li le they
have will be taken away.
30 Now throw this useless servant into
outer darkness, where there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
31 "But when the Son of Man comes in
his glory, and all the angels with him,
then he will sit upon his glorious throne.MATTHEW 25
32 All the na
148
ons will be gathered in his
presence, and he will separate them as a
shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats.
33 He will place the sheep at his right
hand and the goats at his le .
34 Then the King will say to those on the
right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my
Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for
you from the founda on of the world.
35 For I was hungry, and you fed me. I
was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I
was a stranger, and you invited me into
your home.
36 I was naked, and you gave me
clothing. I was sick, and you cared for
me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’
37 "Then these righteous ones will reply,
‘Lord, when did we ever see you hungry
and feed you? Or thirsty and give you
something to drink?MATTHEW 25
149
38 Or a stranger and show you
hospitality? Or naked and give you
clothing?
39 When did we ever see you sick or in
prison, and visit you?’
40 And the King will tell them, ‘I assure
you, when you did it to one of the least
of these my brothers and sisters, you
were doing it to me!’
41 "Then the King will turn to those
on the le and say, ‘Away with you,
you cursed ones, into the eternal ﬁre
prepared for the Devil and his demons!
42 For I was hungry, and you didn’t feed
me. I was thirsty, and you didn’t give me
anything to drink.
43 I was a stranger, and you didn’t invite
me into your home. I was naked, and
you gave me no clothing. I was sick and
in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’
44 "Then they will reply, ‘Lord, when did
we ever see you hungry or thirsty or aMATTHEW 25 – 26
150
stranger or naked or sick or in prison,
and not help you?’
45 And he will answer, ‘I assure you,
when you refused to help the least of
these my brothers and sisters, you were
refusing to help me.’
46 And they will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous will go
into eternal life."
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished saying
these things, he said to his
disciples,
2 "As you know, the Passover
celebra on begins in two days, and I,
the Son of Man, will be betrayed and
cruciﬁed."
3 At that same me the leading priests
and other leaders were mee ng at the
residence of Caiaphas, the high priest,
4 to discuss how to capture Jesus
secretly and put him to death.
26MATTHEW 26
151
5 "But not during the Passover," they
agreed, "or there will be a riot."
6 Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at
the home of Simon, a man who had
leprosy.
7 During supper, a woman came in with
a beau ful jar of expensive perfume and
poured it over his head.
8 The disciples were indignant when
they saw this. "What a waste of money,"
they said.
9 "She could have sold it for a fortune
and given the money to the poor."
10 But Jesus replied, "Why berate her
for doing such a good thing to me?
11 You will always have the poor among
you, but I will not be here with you much
longer.
12 She has poured this perfume on me
to prepare my body for burial.
13 I assure you, wherever the Good
News is preached throughout the world,MATTHEW 26
152
this woman’s deed will be talked about
in her memory."
14 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve
disciples, went to the leading priests
15 and asked, "How much will you pay
me to betray Jesus to you?" And they
gave him thirty pieces of silver.
16 From that me on, Judas began
looking for the right me and place to
betray Jesus.
17 On the ﬁrst day of the Fes val of
Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to
Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us
to prepare the Passover supper?"
18 "As you go into the city," he told
them, "you will see a certain man. Tell
him, ‘The Teacher says, My me has
come, and I will eat the Passover meal
with my disciples at your house.’"
19 So the disciples did as Jesus told
them and prepared the Passover supper
there.MATTHEW 26
153
20 When it was evening, Jesus sat down
at the table with the twelve disciples.
21 While they were ea ng, he said, "The
truth is, one of you will betray me."
22 Greatly distressed, one by one they
began to ask him, "I’m not the one, am I,
Lord?"
23 He replied, "One of you who is ea ng
with me now will betray me.
24 For I, the Son of Man, must die, as
the Scriptures declared long ago. But
how terrible it will be for my betrayer.
Far be er for him if he had never been
born!"
25 Judas, the one who would betray
him, also asked, "Teacher, I’m not the
one, am I?" And Jesus told him, "You
have said it yourself."
26 As they were ea ng, Jesus took a loaf
of bread and asked God’s blessing on it.
Then he broke it in pieces and gave it toMATTHEW 26
154
the disciples, saying, "Take it and eat it,
for this is my body."
27 And he took a cup of wine and gave
thanks to God for it. He gave it to them
and said, "Each of you drink from it,
28 for this is my blood, which seals the
covenant between God and his people.
It is poured out to forgive the sins of
many.
29 Mark my words––I will not drink
wine again un l the day I drink it new
with you in my Father’s Kingdom."
30 Then they sang a hymn and went out
to the Mount of Olives.
31 "Tonight all of you will desert me,"
Jesus told them. "For the Scriptures say,
‘God will strike the Shepherd, and the
sheep of the ﬂock will be sca ered.’
32 But a er I have been raised from the
dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee
and meet you there."MATTHEW 26
155
33 Peter declared, "Even if everyone
else deserts you, I never will."
34 "Peter," Jesus replied, "the truth is,
this very night, before the rooster crows,
you will deny me three mes."
35 "No!" Peter insisted. "Not even if I
have to die with you! I will never deny
you!" And all the other disciples vowed
the same.
36 Then Jesus brought them to an olive
grove called Gethsemane, and he said,
"Sit here while I go on ahead to pray."
37 He took Peter and Zebedee’s two
sons, James and John, and he began to
be ﬁlled with anguish and deep distress.
38 He told them, "My soul is crushed
with grief to the point of death. Stay
here and watch with me."
39 He went on a li le farther and fell
face down on the ground, praying, "My
Father! If it is possible, let this cup ofMATTHEW 26
156
suﬀering be taken away from me. Yet I
want your will, not mine."
40 Then he returned to the disciples
and found them asleep. He said to Peter,
"Couldn’t you stay awake and watch
with me even one hour?
41 Keep alert and pray. Otherwise
tempta on will overpower you. For
though the spirit is willing enough, the
body is weak!"
42 Again he le them and prayed, "My
Father! If this cup cannot be taken away
un l I drink it, your will be done."
43 He returned to them again and found
them sleeping, for they just couldn’t
keep their eyes open.
44 So he went back to pray a third me,
saying the same things again.
45 Then he came to the disciples and
said, "S ll sleeping? S ll res ng? Look,
the me has come. I, the Son of Man,
am betrayed into the hands of sinners.MATTHEW 26
157
46 Up, let’s be going. See, my betrayer is
here!"
47 And even as he said this, Judas, one
of the twelve disciples, arrived with a
mob that was armed with swords and
clubs. They had been sent out by the
leading priests and other leaders of the
people.
48 Judas had given them a prearranged
signal: "You will know which one to
arrest when I go over and give him the
kiss of gree ng."
49 So Judas came straight to Jesus.
"Gree ngs, Teacher!" he exclaimed and
gave him the kiss.
50 Jesus said, "My friend, go ahead and
do what you have come for." Then the
others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
51 One of the men with Jesus pulled out
a sword and slashed oﬀ an ear of the
high priest’s servant.MATTHEW 26
158
52 "Put away your sword," Jesus told
him. "Those who use the sword will be
killed by the sword.
53 Don’t you realize that I could ask my
Father for thousands of angels to protect
us, and he would send them instantly?
54 But if I did, how would the Scriptures
be fulﬁlled that describe what must
happen now?"
55 Then Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I
some dangerous criminal, that you have
come armed with swords and clubs to
arrest me? Why didn’t you arrest me in
the Temple? I was there teaching every
day.
56 But this is all happening to fulﬁll the
words of the prophets as recorded in
the Scriptures." At that point, all the
disciples deserted him and ﬂed.
57 Then the people who had arrested
Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas,
the high priest, where the teachersMATTHEW 26
159
of religious law and other leaders had
gathered.
58 Meanwhile, Peter was following
far behind and eventually came to the
courtyard of the high priest’s house. He
went in, sat with the guards, and waited
to see what was going to happen to
Jesus.
59 Inside, the leading priests and the
en re high council were trying to ﬁnd
witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so
they could put him to death.
60 But even though they found many
who agreed to give false witness, there
was no tes mony they could use. Finally,
two men were found
61 who declared, "This man said, ‘I am
able to destroy the Temple of God and
rebuild it in three days.’"
62 Then the high priest stood up and
said to Jesus, "Well, aren’t you goingMATTHEW 26
160
to answer these charges? What do you
have to say for yourself?"
63 But Jesus remained silent. Then the
high priest said to him, "I demand in the
name of the living God that you tell us
whether you are the Messiah, the Son of
God."
64 Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as you say.
And in the future you will see me, the
Son of Man, si ng at God’s right hand in
the place of power and coming back on
the clouds of heaven."
65 Then the high priest tore his
clothing to show his horror, shou ng,
"Blasphemy! Why do we need other
witnesses? You have all heard his
blasphemy.
66 What is your verdict?" "Guilty!" they
shouted. "He must die!"
67 Then they spit in Jesus’ face and hit
him with their ﬁsts. And some slapped
him,MATTHEW 26
161
68 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Messiah!
Who hit you that me?"
69 Meanwhile, as Peter was si ng
outside in the courtyard, a servant girl
came over and said to him, "You were
one of those with Jesus the Galilean."
70 But Peter denied it in front of
everyone. "I don’t know what you are
talking about," he said.
71 Later, out by the gate, another
servant girl no ced him and said to
those standing around, "This man was
with Jesus of Nazareth."
72 Again Peter denied it, this me with
an oath. "I don’t even know the man,"
he said.
73 A li le later some other bystanders
came over to him and said, "You must be
one of them; we can tell by your Galilean
accent."MATTHEW 26 – 27
162
74 Peter said, "I swear by God, I don’t
know the man." And immediately the
rooster crowed.
75 Suddenly, Jesus’ words ﬂashed
through Peter’s mind: "Before the
rooster crows, you will deny me three
mes." And he went away, crying
bi erly.
1 Very early in the morning, the
leading priests and other leaders
met again to discuss how to persuade
the Roman government to sentence
Jesus to death.
2 Then they bound him and took him to
Pilate, the Roman governor.
3 When Judas, who had betrayed him,
realized that Jesus had been condemned
to die, he was ﬁlled with remorse. So he
took the thirty pieces of silver back to
the leading priests and other leaders.
4 "I have sinned," he declared, "for I
have betrayed an innocent man." "What
27MATTHEW 27
163
do we care?" they retorted. "That’s your
problem."
5 Then Judas threw the money onto the
ﬂoor of the Temple and went out and
hanged himself.
6 The leading priests picked up the
money. "We can’t put it in the Temple
treasury," they said, "since it’s against
the law to accept money paid for
murder."
7 A er some discussion they ﬁnally
decided to buy the po er’s ﬁeld,
and they made it into a cemetery for
foreigners.
8 That is why the ﬁeld is s ll called the
Field of Blood.
9 This fulﬁlled the prophecy of Jeremiah
that says, "They took the thirty pieces of
silver––the price at which he was valued
by the people of Israel––
10 and purchased the po er’s ﬁeld, as
the Lord directed."MATTHEW 27
164
11 Now Jesus was standing before
Pilate, the Roman governor. "Are you the
King of the Jews?" the governor asked
him. Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as you say."
12 But when the leading priests and
other leaders made their accusa ons
against him, Jesus remained silent.
13 "Don’t you hear their many charges
against you?" Pilate demanded.
14 But Jesus said nothing, much to the
governor’s great surprise.
15 Now it was the governor’s custom to
release one prisoner to the crowd each
year during the Passover celebra on––
anyone they wanted.
16 This year there was a notorious
criminal in prison, a man named
Barabbas.
17 As the crowds gathered before
Pilate’s house that morning, he asked
them, "Which one do you want me toMATTHEW 27
165
release to you––Barabbas, or Jesus who
is called the Messiah?"
18 (He knew very well that the Jewish
leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy.)
19 Just then, as Pilate was si ng on
the judgment seat, his wife sent him
this message: "Leave that innocent man
alone, because I had a terrible nightmare
about him last night."
20 Meanwhile, the leading priests and
other leaders persuaded the crowds to
ask for Barabbas to be released and for
Jesus to be put to death.
21 So when the governor asked again,
"Which of these two do you want me to
release to you?" the crowd shouted back
their reply: "Barabbas!"
22 "But if I release Barabbas," Pilate
asked them, "what should I do with
Jesus who is called the Messiah?" And
they all shouted, "Crucify him!"MATTHEW 27
166
23 "Why?" Pilate demanded. "What
crime has he commi ed?" But the crowd
only roared the louder, "Crucify him!"
24 Pilate saw that he wasn’t ge ng
anywhere and that a riot was
developing. So he sent for a bowl of
water and washed his hands before the
crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the
blood of this man. The responsibility is
yours!"
25 And all the people yelled back, "We
will take responsibility for his death––we
and our children!"
26 So Pilate released Barabbas to
them. He ordered Jesus ﬂogged with a
lead– pped whip, then turned him over
to the Roman soldiers to crucify him.
27 Some of the governor’s soldiers took
Jesus into their headquarters and called
out the en re ba alion.
28 They stripped him and put a scarlet
robe on him.MATTHEW 27
167
29 They made a crown of long, sharp
thorns and put it on his head, and they
placed a s ck in his right hand as a
scepter. Then they knelt before him
in mockery, yelling, "Hail! King of the
Jews!"
30 And they spit on him and grabbed
the s ck and beat him on the head with
it.
31 When they were ﬁnally red of
mocking him, they took oﬀ the robe and
put his own clothes on him again. Then
they led him away to be cruciﬁed.
32 As they were on the way, they came
across a man named Simon, who was
from Cyrene, and they forced him to
carry Jesus’ cross.
33 Then they went out to a place called
Golgotha (which means Skull Hill).
34 The soldiers gave him wine mixed
with bi er gall, but when he had tasted
it, he refused to drink it.MATTHEW 27
35 A
168
er they had nailed him to the
cross, the soldiers gambled for his
clothes by throwing dice.
36 Then they sat around and kept guard
as he hung there.
37 A signboard was fastened to the
cross above Jesus’ head, announcing
the charge against him. It read: "This is
Jesus, the King of the Jews."
38 Two criminals were cruciﬁed with
him, their crosses on either side of his.
39 And the people passing by shouted
abuse, shaking their heads in mockery.
40 "So! You can destroy the Temple and
build it again in three days, can you?
Well then, if you are the Son of God,
save yourself and come down from the
cross!"
41 The leading priests, the teachers of
religious law, and the other leaders also
mocked Jesus.MATTHEW 27
169
42 "He saved others," they scoﬀed, "but
he can’t save himself! So he is the king
of Israel, is he? Let him come down from
the cross, and we will believe in him!
43 He trusted God––let God show his
approval by delivering him! For he said,
‘I am the Son of God.’"
44 And the criminals who were cruciﬁed
with him also shouted the same insults
at him.
45 At noon, darkness fell across the
whole land un l three o’clock.
46 At about three o’clock, Jesus called
out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema
sabachthani?" which means, "My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?"
47 Some of the bystanders
misunderstood and thought he
was calling for the prophet Elijah.
48 One of them ran and ﬁlled a sponge
with sour wine, holding it up to him on a
s ck so he could drink.MATTHEW 27
170
49 But the rest said, "Leave him alone.
Let’s see whether Elijah will come and
save him."
50 Then Jesus shouted out again, and he
gave up his spirit.
51 At that moment the curtain in the
Temple was torn in two, from top to
bo om. The earth shook, rocks split
apart,
52 and tombs opened. The bodies of
many godly men and women who had
died were raised from the dead
53 a er Jesus’ resurrec on. They le
the cemetery, went into the holy city
of Jerusalem, and appeared to many
people.
54 The Roman oﬃcer and the other
soldiers at the cruciﬁxion were terriﬁed
by the earthquake and all that had
happened. They said, "Truly, this was the
Son of God!"MATTHEW 27
171
55 And many women who had come
from Galilee with Jesus to care for him
were watching from a distance.
56 Among them were Mary Magdalene,
Mary (the mother of James and Joseph),
and Zebedee’s wife, the mother of James
and John.
57 As evening approached, Joseph, a
rich man from Arimathea who was one
of Jesus’ followers,
58 went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’
body. And Pilate issued an order to
release it to him.
59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it
in a long linen cloth.
60 He placed it in his own new tomb,
which had been carved out of the rock.
Then he rolled a great stone across the
entrance as he le .
61 Both Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary were si ng nearby watching.MATTHEW 27 – 28
172
62 The next day––on the ﬁrst day of
the Passover ceremonies ––the leading
priests and Pharisees went to see Pilate.
63 They told him, "Sir, we remember
what that deceiver once said while he
was s ll alive: ‘A er three days I will be
raised from the dead.’
64 So we request that you seal the tomb
un l the third day. This will prevent his
disciples from coming and stealing his
body and then telling everyone he came
back to life! If that happens, we’ll be
worse oﬀ than we were at ﬁrst."
65 Pilate replied, "Take guards and
secure it the best you can."
66 So they sealed the tomb and posted
guards to protect it.
1 Early on Sunday morning, as
the new day was dawning, Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary went
out to see the tomb.
28MATTHEW 28
173
2 Suddenly there was a great
earthquake, because an angel of the
Lord came down from heaven and rolled
aside the stone and sat on it.
3 His face shone like lightning, and his
clothing was as white as snow.
4 The guards shook with fear when they
saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.
5 Then the angel spoke to the women.
"Don’t be afraid!" he said. "I know you
are looking for Jesus, who was cruciﬁed.
6 He isn’t here! He has been raised from
the dead, just as he said would happen.
Come, see where his body was lying.
7 And now, go quickly and tell his
disciples he has been raised from the
dead, and he is going ahead of you
to Galilee. You will see him there.
Remember, I have told you."
8 The women ran quickly from the
tomb. They were very frightened but
also ﬁlled with great joy, and they rushedMATTHEW 28
174
to ﬁnd the disciples to give them the
angel’s message.
9 And as they went, Jesus met them.
"Gree ngs!" he said. And they ran to
him, held his feet, and worshiped him.
10 Then Jesus said to them, "Don’t be
afraid! Go tell my brothers to leave for
Galilee, and they will see me there."
11 As the women were on their way
into the city, some of the men who had
been guarding the tomb went to the
leading priests and told them what had
happened.
12 A mee ng of all the religious leaders
was called, and they decided to bribe
the soldiers.
13 They told the soldiers, "You must say,
‘Jesus’ disciples came during the night
while we were sleeping, and they stole
his body.’MATTHEW 28
175
14 If the governor hears about it, we’ll
stand up for you and everything will be
all right."
15 So the guards accepted the bribe and
said what they were told to say. Their
story spread widely among the Jews,
and they s ll tell it today.
16 Then the eleven disciples le for
Galilee, going to the mountain where
Jesus had told them to go.
17 When they saw him, they worshiped
him––but some of them s ll doubted!
18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I
have been given complete authority in
heaven and on earth.
19 Therefore, go and make disciples of
all the na ons, bap zing them in the
name of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit.
20 Teach these new disciples to obey all
the commands I have given you. And beMATTHEW 28
176
sure of this: I am with you always, even
to the end of the age."Mark
1
1 Here begins the Good News about
Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
2 In the book of the prophet Isaiah, God
said, "Look, I am sending my messenger
before you, and he will prepare your
way.
3 He is a voice shou ng in the
wilderness: ‘Prepare a pathway for the
Lord’s coming! Make a straight road for
him!’"
4 This messenger was John the Bap st.
He lived in the wilderness and was
preaching that people should be
bap zed to show that they had turned
from their sins and turned to God to be
forgiven.
5 People from Jerusalem and from
all over Judea traveled out into theMARK 1
2
wilderness to see and hear John. And
when they confessed their sins, he
bap zed them in the Jordan River.
6 His clothes were woven from camel
hair, and he wore a leather belt; his food
was locusts and wild honey.
7 He announced: "Someone is coming
soon who is far greater than I am––so
much greater that I am not even worthy
to be his slave.
8 I bap ze you with water, but he will
bap ze you with the Holy Spirit!"
9 One day Jesus came from Nazareth in
Galilee, and he was bap zed by John in
the Jordan River.
10 And when Jesus came up out of the
water, he saw the heavens split open
and the Holy Spirit descending like a
dove on him.
11 And a voice came from heaven
saying, "You are my beloved Son, and I
am fully pleased with you."MARK 1
3
12 Immediately the Holy Spirit
compelled Jesus to go into the
wilderness.
13 He was there for forty days, being
tempted by Satan. He was out among
the wild animals, and angels took care of
him.
14 Later on, a er John was arrested by
Herod An pas, Jesus went to Galilee to
preach God’s Good News.
15 "At last the me has come!" he
announced. "The Kingdom of God is
near! Turn from your sins and believe
this Good News!"
16 One day as Jesus was walking along
the shores of the Sea of Galilee, he saw
Simon and his brother, Andrew, ﬁshing
with a net, for they were commercial
ﬁshermen.
17 Jesus called out to them, "Come, be
my disciples, and I will show you how to
ﬁsh for people!"MARK 1
18 And they le
4
their nets at once and
went with him.
19 A li le farther up the shore Jesus saw
Zebedee’s sons, James and John, in a
boat mending their nets.
20 He called them, too, and immediately
they le their father, Zebedee, in the
boat with the hired men and went with
him.
21 Jesus and his companions went to
the town of Capernaum, and every
Sabbath day he went into the synagogue
and taught the people.
22 They were amazed at his teaching,
for he taught as one who had real
authority––quite unlike the teachers of
religious law.
23 A man possessed by an evil spirit was
in the synagogue,
24 and he began shou ng, "Why are you
bothering us, Jesus of Nazareth? HaveMARK 1
5
you come to destroy us? I know who you
are––the Holy One sent from God!"
25 Jesus cut him short. "Be silent! Come
out of the man."
26 At that, the evil spirit screamed and
threw the man into a convulsion, but
then he le him.
27 Amazement gripped the audience,
and they began to discuss what had
happened. "What sort of new teaching
is this?" they asked excitedly. "It has
such authority! Even evil spirits obey his
orders!"
28 The news of what he had done
spread quickly through that en re area
of Galilee.
29 A er Jesus and his disciples le the
synagogue, they went over to Simon and
Andrew’s home, and James and John
were with them.MARK 1
6
30 Simon’s mother–in–law was sick in
bed with a high fever. They told Jesus
about her right away.
31 He went to her bedside, and as he
took her by the hand and helped her to
sit up, the fever suddenly le , and she
got up and prepared a meal for them.
32 That evening at sunset, many sick
and demon–possessed people were
brought to Jesus.
33 And a huge crowd of people from all
over Capernaum gathered outside the
door to watch.
34 So Jesus healed great numbers of sick
people who had many diﬀerent kinds of
diseases, and he ordered many demons
to come out of their vic ms. But because
they knew who he was, he refused to
allow the demons to speak.
35 The next morning Jesus awoke long
before daybreak and went out alone into
the wilderness to pray.MARK 1
7
36 Later Simon and the others went out
to ﬁnd him.
37 They said, "Everyone is asking for
you."
38 But he replied, "We must go on to
other towns as well, and I will preach to
them, too, because that is why I came."
39 So he traveled throughout the region
of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues
and expelling demons from many
people.
40 A man with leprosy came and knelt
in front of Jesus, begging to be healed.
"If you want to, you can make me well
again," he said.
41 Moved with pity, Jesus touched him.
"I want to," he said. "Be healed!"
42 Instantly the leprosy disappeared––
the man was healed.
43 Then Jesus sent him on his way and
told him sternly,MARK 1 – 2
8
44 "Go right over to the priest and let
him examine you. Don’t talk to anyone
along the way. Take along the oﬀering
required in the law of Moses for those
who have been healed of leprosy,
so everyone will have proof of your
healing."
45 But as the man went on his way, he
spread the news, telling everyone what
had happened to him. As a result, such
crowds soon surrounded Jesus that he
couldn’t enter a town anywhere publicly.
He had to stay out in the secluded
places, and people from everywhere
came to him there.
1 Several days later Jesus returned
to Capernaum, and the news of his
arrival spread quickly through the town.
2 Soon the house where he was staying
was so packed with visitors that there
wasn’t room for one more person, not
2MARK 2
9
even outside the door. And he preached
the word to them.
3 Four men arrived carrying a paralyzed
man on a mat.
4 They couldn’t get to Jesus through the
crowd, so they dug through the clay roof
above his head. Then they lowered the
sick man on his mat, right down in front
of Jesus.
5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the
paralyzed man, "My son, your sins are
forgiven."
6 But some of the teachers of religious
law who were si ng there said to
themselves,
7 "What? This is blasphemy! Who but
God can forgive sins!"
8 Jesus knew what they were discussing
among themselves, so he said to them,
"Why do you think this is blasphemy?MARK 2
10
9 Is it easier to say to the paralyzed
man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or ‘Get up,
pick up your mat, and walk’?
10 I will prove that I, the Son of Man,
have the authority on earth to forgive
sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed
man and said,
11 "Stand up, take your mat, and go on
home, because you are healed!"
12 The man jumped up, took the mat,
and pushed his way through the stunned
onlookers. Then they all praised God.
"We’ve never seen anything like this
before!" they exclaimed.
13 Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore
again and taught the crowds that
gathered around him.
14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son
of Alphaeus si ng at his tax–collec on
booth. "Come, be my disciple," Jesus
said to him. So Levi got up and followed
him.MARK 2
11
15 That night Levi invited Jesus and his
disciples to be his dinner guests, along
with his fellow tax collectors and many
other notorious sinners. (There were
many people of this kind among the
crowds that followed Jesus.)
16 But when some of the teachers of
religious law who were Pharisees saw
him ea ng with people like that, they
said to his disciples, "Why does he eat
with such scum?"
17 When Jesus heard this, he told
them, "Healthy people don’t need a
doctor––sick people do. I have come to
call sinners, not those who think they
are already good enough."
18 John’s disciples and the Pharisees
some mes fasted. One day some people
came to Jesus and asked, "Why do John’s
disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your
disciples don’t fast?"MARK 2
12
19 Jesus replied, "Do wedding guests
fast while celebra ng with the groom?
Of course not. They can’t fast while they
are with the groom.
20 But someday he will be taken away
from them, and then they will fast.
21 And who would patch an old garment
with unshrunk cloth? For the new patch
shrinks and pulls away from the old
cloth, leaving an even bigger hole than
before.
22 And no one puts new wine into
old wineskins. The wine would burst
the wineskins, spilling the wine and
ruining the skins. New wine needs new
wineskins."
23 One Sabbath day as Jesus was
walking through some grainﬁelds, his
disciples began breaking oﬀ heads of
wheat.
24 But the Pharisees said to Jesus, "They
shouldn’t be doing that! It’s against theMARK 2 – 3
13
law to work by harves ng grain on the
Sabbath."
25 But Jesus replied, "Haven’t you ever
read in the Scriptures what King David
did when he and his companions were
hungry?
26 He went into the house of God
(during the days when Abiathar was high
priest), ate the special bread reserved for
the priests alone, and then gave some to
his companions. That was breaking the
law, too."
27 Then he said to them, "The Sabbath
was made to beneﬁt people, and not
people to beneﬁt the Sabbath.
28 And I, the Son of Man, am master
even of the Sabbath!"
1 Jesus went into the synagogue
again and no ced a man with a
deformed hand.
2 Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus’
enemies watched him closely. Would he
3MARK 3
14
heal the man’s hand on the Sabbath? If
he did, they planned to condemn him.
3 Jesus said to the man, "Come and
stand in front of everyone."
4 Then he turned to his cri cs and
asked, "Is it legal to do good deeds on
the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing
harm? Is this a day to save life or to
destroy it?" But they wouldn’t answer
him.
5 He looked around at them angrily,
because he was deeply disturbed by
their hard hearts. Then he said to the
man, "Reach out your hand." The man
reached out his hand, and it became
normal again!
6 At once the Pharisees went away and
met with the supporters of Herod to
discuss plans for killing Jesus.
7 Jesus and his disciples went out to the
lake, followed by a huge crowd from all
over Galilee, Judea,MARK 3
15
8 Jerusalem, Idumea, from east of the
Jordan River, and even from as far away
as Tyre and Sidon. The news about his
miracles had spread far and wide, and
vast numbers of people came to see him
for themselves.
9 Jesus instructed his disciples to bring
around a boat and to have it ready in
case he was crowded oﬀ the beach.
10 There had been many healings that
day. As a result, many sick people were
crowding around him, trying to touch
him.
11 And whenever those possessed by
evil spirits caught sight of him, they
would fall down in front of him shrieking,
"You are the Son of God!"
12 But Jesus strictly warned them not to
say who he was.
13 A erward Jesus went up on a
mountain and called the ones he wanted
to go with him. And they came to him.MARK 3
16
14 Then he selected twelve of them to
be his regular companions, calling them
apostles. He sent them out to preach,
15 and he gave them authority to cast
out demons.
16 These are the names of the twelve he
chose: Simon (he renamed him Peter),
17 James and John (the sons of Zebedee,
but Jesus nicknamed them "Sons of
Thunder"),
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Ma hew, Thomas, James (son of
Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon (the
Zealot),
19 Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed
him).
20 When Jesus returned to the house
where he was staying, the crowds began
to gather again, and soon he and his
disciples couldn’t even ﬁnd me to eat.
21 When his family heard what was
happening, they tried to take him homeMARK 3
17
with them. "He’s out of his mind," they
said.
22 But the teachers of religious law
who had arrived from Jerusalem said,
"He’s possessed by Satan, the prince of
demons. That’s where he gets the power
to cast out demons."
23 Jesus called them over and said to
them by way of illustra on, "How can
Satan cast out Satan?
24 A kingdom at war with itself will
collapse.
25 A home divided against itself is
doomed.
26 And if Satan is ﬁgh ng against
himself, how can he stand? He would
never survive.
27 Let me illustrate this. You can’t
enter a strong man’s house and rob him
without ﬁrst tying him up. Only then can
his house be robbed!MARK 3
18
28 "I assure you that any sin can be
forgiven, including blasphemy;
29 but anyone who blasphemes against
the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. It
is an eternal sin."
30 He told them this because they were
saying he had an evil spirit.
31 Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived at
the house where he was teaching. They
stood outside and sent word for him to
come out and talk with them.
32 There was a crowd around Jesus, and
someone said, "Your mother and your
brothers and sisters are outside, asking
for you."
33 Jesus replied, "Who is my mother?
Who are my brothers?"
34 Then he looked at those around him
and said, "These are my mother and
brothers.
35 Anyone who does God’s will is my
brother and sister and mother."MARK 4
4
19
1 Once again Jesus began teaching
by the lakeshore. There was such a
large crowd along the shore that he got
into a boat and sat down and spoke from
there.
2 He began to teach the people by
telling many stories such as this one:
3 "Listen! A farmer went out to plant
some seed.
4 As he sca ered it across his ﬁeld,
some seed fell on a footpath, and the
birds came and ate it.
5 Other seed fell on shallow soil with
underlying rock. The plant sprang up
quickly,
6 but it soon wilted beneath the hot
sun and died because the roots had no
nourishment in the shallow soil.
7 Other seed fell among thorns that
shot up and choked out the tender
blades so that it produced no grain.MARK 4
8S
20
ll other seed fell on fer le soil and
produced a crop that was thirty, sixty,
and even a hundred mes as much as
had been planted." Then he said,
9 "Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen and understand!"
10 Later, when Jesus was alone with the
twelve disciples and with the others who
were gathered around, they asked him,
"What do your stories mean?"
11 He replied, "You are permi ed
to understand the secret about the
Kingdom of God. But I am using these
stories to conceal everything about it
from outsiders,
12 so that the Scriptures might be
fulﬁlled: ‘They see what I do, but they
don’t perceive its meaning. They hear
my words, but they don’t understand. So
they will not turn from their sins and be
forgiven.’MARK 4
21
13 "But if you can’t understand this
story, how will you understand all the
others I am going to tell?
14 The farmer I talked about is the one
who brings God’s message to others.
15 The seed that fell on the hard path
represents those who hear the message,
but then Satan comes at once and takes
it away from them.
16 The rocky soil represents those who
hear the message and receive it with joy.
17 But like young plants in such soil,
their roots don’t go very deep. At ﬁrst
they get along ﬁne, but they wilt as soon
as they have problems or are persecuted
because they believe the word.
18 The thorny ground represents those
who hear and accept the Good News,
19 but all too quickly the message is
crowded out by the cares of this life, the
lure of wealth, and the desire for nice
things, so no crop is produced.MARK 4
22
20 But the good soil represents those
who hear and accept God’s message and
produce a huge harvest––thirty, sixty, or
even a hundred mes as much as had
been planted."
21 Then Jesus asked them, "Would
anyone light a lamp and then put it
under a basket or under a bed to shut
out the light? Of course not! A lamp is
placed on a stand, where its light will
shine.
22 "Everything that is now hidden or
secret will eventually be brought to light.
23 Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen and understand!
24 And be sure to pay a en on to what
you hear. The more you do this, the
more you will understand––and even
more, besides.
25 To those who are open to my
teaching, more understanding will be
given. But to those who are not listening,MARK 4
23
even what they have will be taken away
from them."
26 Jesus also said, "Here is another
illustra on of what the Kingdom of God
is like: A farmer planted seeds in a ﬁeld,
27 and then he went on with his other
ac vi es. As the days went by, the seeds
sprouted and grew without the farmer’s
help,
28 because the earth produces crops
on its own. First a leaf blade pushes
through, then the heads of wheat are
formed, and ﬁnally the grain ripens.
29 And as soon as the grain is ready,
the farmer comes and harvests it with a
sickle."
30 Jesus asked, "How can I describe the
Kingdom of God? What story should I
use to illustrate it?
31 It is like a ny mustard seed. Though
this is one of the smallest of seeds,MARK 4
24
32 it grows to become one of the largest
of plants, with long branches where
birds can come and ﬁnd shelter."
33 He used many such stories and
illustra ons to teach the people as much
as they were able to understand.
34 In fact, in his public teaching he
taught only with parables, but a erward
when he was alone with his disciples, he
explained the meaning to them.
35 As evening came, Jesus said to his
disciples, "Let’s cross to the other side of
the lake."
36 He was already in the boat, so they
started out, leaving the crowds behind
(although other boats followed).
37 But soon a ﬁerce storm arose. High
waves began to break into the boat un l
it was nearly full of water.
38 Jesus was sleeping at the back of
the boat with his head on a cushion.
Fran cally they woke him up, shou ng,MARK 4 – 5
25
"Teacher, don’t you even care that we
are going to drown?"
39 When he woke up, he rebuked the
wind and said to the water, "Quiet
down!" Suddenly the wind stopped, and
there was a great calm.
40 And he asked them, "Why are you
so afraid? Do you s ll not have faith in
me?"
41 And they were ﬁlled with awe and
said among themselves, "Who is this
man, that even the wind and waves obey
him?"
1 So they arrived at the other side
of the lake, in the land of the
Gerasenes.
2 Just as Jesus was climbing from the
boat, a man possessed by an evil spirit
ran out from a cemetery to meet him.
3 This man lived among the tombs and
could not be restrained, even with a
chain.
5MARK 5
26
4 Whenever he was put into chains and
shackles––as he o en was––he snapped
the chains from his wrists and smashed
the shackles. No one was strong enough
to control him.
5 All day long and throughout the night,
he would wander among the tombs and
in the hills, screaming and hi ng himself
with stones.
6 When Jesus was s ll some distance
away, the man saw him. He ran to meet
Jesus and fell down before him.
7 He gave a terrible scream, shrieking,
"Why are you bothering me, Jesus, Son
of the Most High God? For God’s sake,
don’t torture me!"
8 For Jesus had already said to the spirit,
"Come out of the man, you evil spirit."
9 Then Jesus asked, "What is your
name?" And the spirit replied, "Legion,
because there are many of us here inside
this man."MARK 5
27
10 Then the spirits begged him again
and again not to send them to some
distant place.
11 There happened to be a large herd of
pigs feeding on the hillside nearby.
12 "Send us into those pigs," the evil
spirits begged.
13 Jesus gave them permission. So the
evil spirits came out of the man and
entered the pigs, and the en re herd of
two thousand pigs plunged down the
steep hillside into the lake, where they
drowned.
14 The herdsmen ﬂed to the nearby
city and the surrounding countryside,
spreading the news as they ran. Everyone
rushed out to see for themselves.
15 A crowd soon gathered around Jesus,
but they were frightened when they
saw the man who had been demon
possessed, for he was si ng there fully
clothed and perfectly sane.MARK 5
28
16 Those who had seen what happened
to the man and to the pigs told everyone
about it,
17 and the crowd began pleading with
Jesus to go away and leave them alone.
18 When Jesus got back into the
boat, the man who had been demon
possessed begged to go, too.
19 But Jesus said, "No, go home to your
friends, and tell them what wonderful
things the Lord has done for you and
how merciful he has been."
20 So the man started oﬀ to visit the Ten
Towns of that region and began to tell
everyone about the great things Jesus
had done for him; and everyone was
amazed at what he told them.
21 When Jesus went back across to the
other side of the lake, a large crowd
gathered around him on the shore.MARK 5
29
22 A leader of the local synagogue,
whose name was Jairus, came and fell
down before him,
23 pleading with him to heal his li le
daughter. "She is about to die," he said
in despera on. "Please come and place
your hands on her; heal her so she can
live."
24 Jesus went with him, and the crowd
thronged behind.
25 And there was a woman in the crowd
who had had a hemorrhage for twelve
years.
26 She had suﬀered a great deal from
many doctors through the years and had
spent everything she had to pay them,
but she had go en no be er. In fact, she
was worse.
27 She had heard about Jesus, so she
came up behind him through the crowd
and touched the fringe of his robe.MARK 5
30
28 For she thought to herself, "If I can
just touch his clothing, I will be healed."
29 Immediately the bleeding stopped,
and she could feel that she had been
healed!
30 Jesus realized at once that healing
power had gone out from him, so he
turned around in the crowd and asked,
"Who touched my clothes?"
31 His disciples said to him, "All this
crowd is pressing around you. How can
you ask, ‘Who touched me?’"
32 But he kept on looking around to see
who had done it.
33 Then the frightened woman,
trembling at the realiza on of what had
happened to her, came and fell at his
feet and told him what she had done.
34 And he said to her, "Daughter, your
faith has made you well. Go in peace.
You have been healed."MARK 5
35 While he was s
31
ll speaking to her,
messengers arrived from Jairus’s home
with the message, "Your daughter is
dead. There’s no use troubling the
Teacher now."
36 But Jesus ignored their comments
and said to Jairus, "Don’t be afraid. Just
trust me."
37 Then Jesus stopped the crowd and
wouldn’t let anyone go with him except
Peter and James and John.
38 When they came to the home
of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw
the commo on and the weeping and
wailing.
39 He went inside and spoke to the
people. "Why all this weeping and
commo on?" he asked. "The child isn’t
dead; she is only asleep."
40 The crowd laughed at him, but he
told them all to go outside. Then he
took the girl’s father and mother and hisMARK 5 – 6
32
three disciples into the room where the
girl was lying.
41 Holding her hand, he said to her, "Get
up, li le girl!"
42 And the girl, who was twelve years
old, immediately stood up and walked
around! Her parents were absolutely
overwhelmed.
43 Jesus commanded them not to tell
anyone what had happened, and he told
them to give her something to eat.
1 Jesus le that part of the country
and returned with his disciples to
Nazareth, his hometown.
2 The next Sabbath he began teaching
in the synagogue, and many who heard
him were astonished. They asked,
"Where did he get all his wisdom and
the power to perform such miracles?
3 He’s just the carpenter, the son of
Mary and brother of James, Joseph,
Judas, and Simon. And his sisters live
6MARK 6
33
right here among us." They were deeply
oﬀended and refused to believe in him.
4 Then Jesus told them, "A prophet is
honored everywhere except in his own
hometown and among his rela ves and
his own family."
5 And because of their unbelief, he
couldn’t do any mighty miracles among
them except to place his hands on a few
sick people and heal them.
6 And he was amazed at their unbelief.
Then Jesus went out from village to
village, teaching.
7 And he called his twelve disciples
together and sent them out two by two,
with authority to cast out evil spirits.
8 He told them to take nothing with
them except a walking s ck––no food,
no traveler’s bag, no money.
9 He told them to wear sandals but not
to take even an extra coat.MARK 6
34
10 "When you enter each village, be a
guest in only one home," he said.
11 "And if a village won’t welcome you
or listen to you, shake oﬀ its dust from
your feet as you leave. It is a sign that
you have abandoned that village to its
fate."
12 So the disciples went out, telling all
they met to turn from their sins.
13 And they cast out many demons
and healed many sick people, anoin ng
them with olive oil.
14 Herod An pas, the king, soon heard
about Jesus, because people everywhere
were talking about him. Some were
saying, "This must be John the Bap st
come back to life again. That is why he
can do such miracles."
15 Others thought Jesus was the ancient
prophet Elijah. S ll others thought
he was a prophet like the other great
prophets of the past.MARK 6
35
16 When Herod heard about Jesus, he
said, "John, the man I beheaded, has
come back from the dead."
17 For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest
and imprison John as a favor to Herodias.
She had been his brother Philip’s wife,
but Herod had married her.
18 John kept telling Herod, "It is illegal
for you to marry your brother’s wife."
19 Herodias was enraged and wanted
John killed in revenge, but without
Herod’s approval she was powerless.
20 And Herod respected John, knowing
that he was a good and holy man, so he
kept him under his protec on. Herod
was disturbed whenever he talked with
John, but even so, he liked to listen to
him.
21 Herodias’s chance ﬁnally came. It was
Herod’s birthday, and he gave a party for
his palace aides, army oﬃcers, and the
leading ci zens of Galilee.MARK 6
36
22 Then his daughter, also named
Herodias, came in and performed a
dance that greatly pleased them all. "Ask
me for anything you like," the king said
to the girl, "and I will give it to you."
23 Then he promised, "I will give you
whatever you ask, up to half of my
kingdom!"
24 She went out and asked her mother,
"What should I ask for?" Her mother told
her, "Ask for John the Bap st’s head!"
25 So the girl hurried back to the king
and told him, "I want the head of John
the Bap st, right now, on a tray!"
26 Then the king was very sorry, but he
was embarrassed to break his oath in
front of his guests.
27 So he sent an execu oner to the
prison to cut oﬀ John’s head and bring it
to him. The soldier beheaded John in the
prison,MARK 6
37
28 brought his head on a tray, and gave
it to the girl, who took it to her mother.
29 When John’s disciples heard what
had happened, they came for his body
and buried it in a tomb.
30 The apostles returned to Jesus from
their ministry tour and told him all they
had done and what they had taught.
31 Then Jesus said, "Let’s get away from
the crowds for a while and rest." There
were so many people coming and going
that Jesus and his apostles didn’t even
have me to eat.
32 They le by boat for a quieter spot.
33 But many people saw them leaving,
and people from many towns ran ahead
along the shore and met them as they
landed.
34 A vast crowd was there as he stepped
from the boat, and he had compassion
on them because they were like sheepMARK 6
38
without a shepherd. So he taught them
many things.
35 Late in the a ernoon his disciples
came to him and said, "This is a desolate
place, and it is ge ng late.
36 Send the crowds away so they can go
to the nearby farms and villages and buy
themselves some food."
37 But Jesus said, "You feed them."
"With what?" they asked. "It would take
a small fortune to buy food for all this
crowd!"
38 "How much food do you have?" he
asked. "Go and ﬁnd out." They came
back and reported, "We have ﬁve loaves
of bread and two ﬁsh."
39 Then Jesus told the crowd to sit down
in groups on the green grass.
40 So they sat in groups of ﬁ y or a
hundred.
41 Jesus took the ﬁve loaves and two
ﬁsh, looked up toward heaven, andMARK 6
39
asked God’s blessing on the food.
Breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept
giving the bread and ﬁsh to the disciples
to give to the people.
42 They all ate as much as they wanted,
43 and they picked up twelve baskets of
le over bread and ﬁsh.
44 Five thousand men had eaten from
those ﬁve loaves!
45 Immediately a er this, Jesus made
his disciples get back into the boat and
head out across the lake to Bethsaida,
while he sent the people home.
46 A erward he went up into the hills
by himself to pray.
47 During the night, the disciples were
in their boat out in the middle of the
lake, and Jesus was alone on land.
48 He saw that they were in serious
trouble, rowing hard and struggling
against the wind and waves. About three
o’clock in the morning he came to them,MARK 6
40
walking on the water. He started to go
past them,
49 but when they saw him walking
on the water, they screamed in terror,
thinking he was a ghost.
50 They were all terriﬁed when they saw
him. But Jesus spoke to them at once.
"It’s all right," he said. "I am here! Don’t
be afraid."
51 Then he climbed into the boat, and
the wind stopped. They were astonished
at what they saw.
52 They s ll didn’t understand the
signiﬁcance of the miracle of the
mul plied loaves, for their hearts were
hard and they did not believe.
53 When they arrived at Gennesaret on
the other side of the lake, they anchored
the boat
54 and climbed out. The people standing
there recognized him at once,MARK 6 – 7
41
55 and they ran throughout the whole
area and began carrying sick people to
him on mats.
56 Wherever he went––in villages and
ci es and out on the farms––they laid
the sick in the market plazas and streets.
The sick begged him to let them at least
touch the fringe of his robe, and all who
touched it were healed.
1 One day some Pharisees and
teachers of religious law arrived
from Jerusalem to confront Jesus.
2 They no ced that some of Jesus’
disciples failed to follow the usual Jewish
ritual of hand washing before ea ng.
3 (The Jews, especially the Pharisees,
do not eat un l they have poured water
over their cupped hands, as required by
their ancient tradi ons.
4 Similarly, they eat nothing bought
from the market unless they have
immersed their hands in water. This is
7MARK 7
42
but one of many tradi ons they have
clung to––such as their ceremony of
washing cups, pitchers, and ke les.)
5 So the Pharisees and teachers of
religious law asked him, "Why don’t your
disciples follow our age–old customs?
For they eat without ﬁrst performing the
hand–washing ceremony."
6 Jesus replied, "You hypocrites! Isaiah
was prophesying about you when he
said,
7 ‘These people honor me with their
lips, but their hearts are far away. Their
worship is a farce, for they replace God’s
commands with their own man–made
teachings.’
8 For you ignore God’s speciﬁc laws and
subs tute your own tradi ons."
9 Then he said, "You reject God’s laws in
order to hold on to your own tradi ons.
10 For instance, Moses gave you this
law from God: ‘Honor your father andMARK 7
43
mother,’ and ‘Anyone who speaks evil of
father or mother must be put to death.’
11 But you say it is all right for people to
say to their parents, ‘Sorry, I can’t help
you. For I have vowed to give to God
what I could have given to you.’
12 You let them disregard their needy
parents.
13 As such, you break the law of God
in order to protect your own tradi on.
And this is only one example. There are
many, many others."
14 Then Jesus called to the crowd to
come and hear. "All of you listen," he
said, "and try to understand.
15 You are not deﬁled by what you eat;
you are deﬁled by what you say and do!"
16 [[EMPTY]]
17 Then Jesus went into a house to
get away from the crowds, and his
disciples asked him what he meant by
the statement he had made.MARK 7
44
18 "Don’t you understand either?" he
asked. "Can’t you see that what you eat
won’t deﬁle you?
19 Food doesn’t come in contact with
your heart, but only passes through the
stomach and then comes out again." (By
saying this, he showed that every kind of
food is acceptable.)
20 And then he added, "It is the
thought–life that deﬁles you.
21 For from within, out of a person’s
heart, come evil thoughts, sexual
immorality, the , murder,
22 adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit,
eagerness for lus ul pleasure, envy,
slander, pride, and foolishness.
23 All these vile things come from
within; they are what deﬁle you and
make you unacceptable to God."
24 Then Jesus le Galilee and went
north to the region of Tyre. He tried to
keep it secret that he was there, but heMARK 7
45
couldn’t. As usual, the news of his arrival
spread fast.
25 Right away a woman came to him
whose li le girl was possessed by an evil
spirit. She had heard about Jesus, and
now she came and fell at his feet.
26 She begged him to release her child
from the demon’s control. Since she was
a Gen le, born in Syrian Phoenicia,
27 Jesus told her, "First I should help my
own family, the Jews. It isn’t right to take
food from the children and throw it to
the dogs."
28 She replied, "That’s true, Lord, but
even the dogs under the table are given
some crumbs from the children’s plates."
29 "Good answer!" he said. "And
because you have answered so well, I
have healed your daughter."
30 And when she arrived home, her
li le girl was lying quietly in bed, and the
demon was gone.MARK 7
31 Jesus le
46
Tyre and went to Sidon,
then back to the Sea of Galilee and the
region of the Ten Towns.
32 A deaf man with a speech
impediment was brought to him, and
the people begged Jesus to lay his hands
on the man to heal him.
33 Jesus led him to a private place
away from the crowd. He put his ﬁngers
into the man’s ears. Then, spi ng onto
his own ﬁngers, he touched the man’s
tongue with the spi le.
34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed
and commanded, "Be opened!"
35 Instantly the man could hear
perfectly and speak plainly!
36 Jesus told the crowd not to tell
anyone, but the more he told them not
to, the more they spread the news,
37 for they were completely amazed.
Again and again they said, "EverythingMARK 8
47
he does is wonderful. He even heals
those who are deaf and mute."
1 About this me another great
crowd had gathered, and the people
ran out of food again. Jesus called his
disciples and told them,
2 "I feel sorry for these people. They
have been here with me for three days,
and they have nothing le to eat.
3 And if I send them home without
feeding them, they will faint along the
road. For some of them have come a
long distance."
4 "How are we supposed to ﬁnd enough
food for them here in the wilderness?"
his disciples asked.
5 "How many loaves of bread do you
have?" he asked. "Seven," they replied.
6 So Jesus told all the people to sit down
on the ground. Then he took the seven
loaves, thanked God for them, broke
them into pieces, and gave them to his
8MARK 8
48
disciples, who distributed the bread to
the crowd.
7 A few small ﬁsh were found, too, so
Jesus also blessed these and told the
disciples to pass them out.
8 They ate un l they were full, and
when the scraps were picked up, there
were seven large baskets of food le
over!
9 There were about four thousand
people in the crowd that day, and he
sent them home a er they had eaten.
10 Immediately a er this, he got into a
boat with his disciples and crossed over
to the region of Dalmanutha.
11 When the Pharisees heard that
Jesus had arrived, they came to argue
with him. Tes ng him to see if he was
from God, they demanded, "Give us a
miraculous sign from heaven to prove
yourself."MARK 8
49
12 When he heard this, he sighed deeply
and said, "Why do you people keep
demanding a miraculous sign? I assure
you, I will not give this genera on any
such sign."
13 So he got back into the boat and le
them, and he crossed to the other side
of the lake.
14 But the disciples discovered they had
forgo en to bring any food, so there was
only one loaf of bread with them in the
boat.
15 As they were crossing the lake, Jesus
warned them, "Beware of the yeast of
the Pharisees and of Herod."
16 They decided he was saying this
because they hadn’t brought any bread.
17 Jesus knew what they were thinking,
so he said, "Why are you so worried
about having no food? Won’t you ever
learn or understand? Are your hearts
too hard to take it in?MARK 8
50
18 ‘You have eyes––can’t you see? You
have ears––can’t you hear?’ Don’t you
remember anything at all?
19 What about the ﬁve thousand men
I fed with ﬁve loaves of bread? How
many baskets of le overs did you pick
up a erward?" "Twelve," they said.
20 "And when I fed the four thousand
with seven loaves, how many large
baskets of le overs did you pick up?"
"Seven," they said.
21 "Don’t you understand even yet?" he
asked them.
22 When they arrived at Bethsaida,
some people brought a blind man to
Jesus, and they begged him to touch and
heal the man.
23 Jesus took the blind man by the hand
and led him out of the village. Then,
spi ng on the man’s eyes, he laid his
hands on him and asked, "Can you see
anything now?"MARK 8
51
24 The man looked around. "Yes," he
said, "I see people, but I can’t see them
very clearly. They look like trees walking
around."
25 Then Jesus placed his hands over
the man’s eyes again. As the man
stared intently, his sight was completely
restored, and he could see everything
clearly.
26 Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don’t
go back into the village on your way
home."
27 Jesus and his disciples le Galilee
and went up to the villages of Caesarea
Philippi. As they were walking along, he
asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
28 "Well," they replied, "some say John
the Bap st, some say Elijah, and others
say you are one of the other prophets."
29 Then Jesus asked, "Who do you
say I am?" Peter replied, "You are the
Messiah."MARK 8
52
30 But Jesus warned them not to tell
anyone about him.
31 Then Jesus began to tell them that
he, the Son of Man, would suﬀer many
terrible things and be rejected by the
leaders, the leading priests, and the
teachers of religious law. He would be
killed, and three days later he would rise
again.
32 As he talked about this openly with
his disciples, Peter took him aside and
told him he shouldn’t say things like that.
33 Jesus turned and looked at his
disciples and then said to Peter very
sternly, "Get away from me, Satan! You
are seeing things merely from a human
point of view, not from God’s."
34 Then he called his disciples and the
crowds to come over and listen. "If any
of you wants to be my follower," he
told them, "you must put aside yourMARK 8 – 9
53
selﬁsh ambi on, shoulder your cross,
and follow me.
35 If you try to keep your life for yourself,
you will lose it. But if you give up your
life for my sake and for the sake of the
Good News, you will ﬁnd true life.
36 And how do you beneﬁt if you gain
the whole world but lose your own soul
in the process?
37 Is anything worth more than your
soul?
38 If a person is ashamed of me and my
message in these adulterous and sinful
days, I, the Son of Man, will be ashamed
of that person when I return in the glory
of my Father with the holy angels."
1 Jesus went on to say, "I assure you
that some of you standing here right
now will not die before you see the
Kingdom of God arrive in great power!"
2 Six days later Jesus took Peter, James,
and John to the top of a mountain. No
9MARK 9
54
one else was there. As the men watched,
Jesus’ appearance changed,
3 and his clothing became dazzling
white, far whiter than any earthly
process could ever make it.
4 Then Elijah and Moses appeared and
began talking with Jesus.
5 "Teacher, this is wonderful!" Peter
exclaimed. "We will make three shrines
––one for you, one for Moses, and one
for Elijah."
6 He didn’t really know what to say, for
they were all terribly afraid.
7 Then a cloud came over them, and a
voice from the cloud said, "This is my
beloved Son. Listen to him."
8 Suddenly they looked around, and
Moses and Elijah were gone, and only
Jesus was with them.
9 As they descended the mountainside,
he told them not to tell anyone whatMARK 9
55
they had seen un l he, the Son of Man,
had risen from the dead.
10 So they kept it to themselves, but
they o en asked each other what he
meant by "rising from the dead."
11 Now they began asking him, "Why do
the teachers of religious law insist that
Elijah must return before the Messiah
comes?"
12 Jesus responded, "Elijah is indeed
coming ﬁrst to set everything in order.
Why then is it wri en in the Scriptures
that the Son of Man must suﬀer and be
treated with u er contempt?
13 But I tell you, Elijah has already come,
and he was badly mistreated, just as the
Scriptures predicted."
14 At the foot of the mountain they
found a great crowd surrounding the
other disciples, as some teachers of
religious law were arguing with them.MARK 9
56
15 The crowd watched Jesus in awe as
he came toward them, and then they
ran to greet him.
16 "What is all this arguing about?" he
asked.
17 One of the men in the crowd spoke
up and said, "Teacher, I brought my
son for you to heal him. He can’t speak
because he is possessed by an evil spirit
that won’t let him talk.
18 And whenever this evil spirit seizes
him, it throws him violently to the
ground and makes him foam at the
mouth and grind his teeth and become
rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast out
the evil spirit, but they couldn’t do it."
19 Jesus said to them, "You faithless
people! How long must I be with you
un l you believe? How long must I put
up with you? Bring the boy to me."
20 So they brought the boy. But when
the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw theMARK 9
57
child into a violent convulsion, and he
fell to the ground, writhing and foaming
at the mouth.
21 "How long has this been happening?"
Jesus asked the boy’s father. He replied,
"Since he was very small.
22 The evil spirit o en makes him fall
into the ﬁre or into water, trying to kill
him. Have mercy on us and help us. Do
something if you can."
23 "What do you mean, ‘If I can’?" Jesus
asked. "Anything is possible if a person
believes."
24 The father instantly replied, "I do
believe, but help me not to doubt!"
25 When Jesus saw that the crowd of
onlookers was growing, he rebuked
the evil spirit. "Spirit of deafness and
muteness," he said, "I command you to
come out of this child and never enter
him again!"MARK 9
58
26 Then the spirit screamed and
threw the boy into another violent
convulsion and le him. The boy lay
there mo onless, and he appeared to be
dead. A murmur ran through the crowd,
"He’s dead."
27 But Jesus took him by the hand and
helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
28 A erward, when Jesus was alone in
the house with his disciples, they asked
him, "Why couldn’t we cast out that evil
spirit?"
29 Jesus replied, "This kind can be cast
out only by prayer."
30 Leaving that region, they traveled
through Galilee. Jesus tried to avoid all
publicity
31 in order to spend more me with
his disciples and teach them. He said to
them, "The Son of Man is going to be
betrayed. He will be killed, but three
days later he will rise from the dead."MARK 9
59
32 But they didn’t understand what he
was saying, and they were afraid to ask
him what he meant.
33 A er they arrived at Capernaum,
Jesus and his disciples se led in the
house where they would be staying.
Jesus asked them, "What were you
discussing out on the road?"
34 But they didn’t answer, because they
had been arguing about which of them
was the greatest.
35 He sat down and called the twelve
disciples over to him. Then he said,
"Anyone who wants to be the ﬁrst must
take last place and be the servant of
everyone else."
36 Then he put a li le child among
them. Taking the child in his arms, he
said to them,
37 "Anyone who welcomes a li le child
like this on my behalf welcomes me, andMARK 9
60
anyone who welcomes me welcomes my
Father who sent me."
38 John said to Jesus, "Teacher, we
saw a man using your name to cast
out demons, but we told him to stop
because he isn’t one of our group."
39 "Don’t stop him!" Jesus said. "No one
who performs miracles in my name will
soon be able to speak evil of me.
40 Anyone who is not against us is for
us.
41 If anyone gives you even a cup
of water because you belong to the
Messiah, I assure you, that person will
be rewarded.
42 "But if anyone causes one of these
li le ones who trusts in me to lose faith,
it would be be er for that person to
be thrown into the sea with a large
millstone ed around the neck.
43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut
it oﬀ. It is be er to enter heaven withMARK 9
61
only one hand than to go into the
unquenchable ﬁres of hell with two
hands.
44 [[EMPTY]]
45 If your foot causes you to sin, cut it
oﬀ. It is be er to enter heaven with only
one foot than to be thrown into hell with
two feet.
46 [[EMPTY]]
47 And if your eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out. It is be er to enter the
Kingdom of God half blind than to have
two eyes and be thrown into hell,
48 ‘where the worm never dies and the
ﬁre never goes out.’
49 "For everyone will be puriﬁed with
ﬁre.
50 Salt is good for seasoning. But if it
loses its ﬂavor, how do you make it salty
again? You must have the quali es of
salt among yourselves and live in peace
with each other."MARK 10
1 Then Jesus le
62
Capernaum and
went southward to the region
of Judea and into the area east of the
Jordan River. As always there were the
crowds, and as usual he taught them.
2 Some Pharisees came and tried to
trap him with this ques on: "Should a
man be allowed to divorce his wife?"
3 "What did Moses say about divorce?"
Jesus asked them.
4 "Well, he permi ed it," they replied.
"He said a man merely has to write his
wife an oﬃcial le er of divorce and send
her away."
5 But Jesus responded, "He wrote those
instruc ons only as a concession to your
hard–hearted wickedness.
6 But God’s plan was seen from the
beginning of crea on, for ‘He made
them male and female.’
10MARK 10
63
7 ‘This explains why a man leaves his
father and mother and is joined to his
wife,
8 and the two are united into one.’ Since
they are no longer two but one,
9 let no one separate them, for God has
joined them together."
10 Later, when he was alone with his
disciples in the house, they brought up
the subject again.
11 He told them, "Whoever divorces his
wife and marries someone else commits
adultery against her.
12 And if a woman divorces her husband
and remarries, she commits adultery."
13 One day some parents brought their
children to Jesus so he could touch them
and bless them, but the disciples told
them not to bother him.
14 But when Jesus saw what was
happening, he was very displeased with
his disciples. He said to them, "Let theMARK 10
64
children come to me. Don’t stop them!
For the Kingdom of God belongs to such
as these.
15 I assure you, anyone who doesn’t
have their kind of faith will never get
into the Kingdom of God."
16 Then he took the children into his
arms and placed his hands on their
heads and blessed them.
17 As he was star ng out on a trip, a
man came running up to Jesus, knelt
down, and asked, "Good Teacher, what
should I do to get eternal life?"
18 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus
asked. "Only God is truly good.
19 But as for your ques on, you know
the commandments: ‘Do not murder. Do
not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do
not tes fy falsely. Do not cheat. Honor
your father and mother.’"MARK 10
65
20 "Teacher," the man replied, "I’ve
obeyed all these commandments since I
was a child."
21 Jesus felt genuine love for this man
as he looked at him. "You lack only one
thing," he told him. "Go and sell all you
have and give the money to the poor,
and you will have treasure in heaven.
Then come, follow me."
22 At this, the man’s face fell, and he
went sadly away because he had many
possessions.
23 Jesus looked around and said to his
disciples, "How hard it is for rich people
to get into the Kingdom of God!"
24 This amazed them. But Jesus said
again, "Dear children, it is very hard to
get into the Kingdom of God.
25 It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich person
to enter the Kingdom of God!"MARK 10
66
26 The disciples were astounded. "Then
who in the world can be saved?" they
asked.
27 Jesus looked at them intently and
said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible.
But not with God. Everything is possible
with God."
28 Then Peter began to men on all
that he and the other disciples had le
behind. "We’ve given up everything to
follow you," he said.
29 And Jesus replied, "I assure you that
everyone who has given up house or
brothers or sisters or mother or father
or children or property, for my sake and
for the Good News,
30 will receive now in return, a hundred
mes over, houses, brothers, sisters,
mothers, children, and property––with
persecu ons. And in the world to come
they will have eternal life.MARK 10
67
31 But many who seem to be important
now will be the least important then,
and those who are considered least here
will be the greatest then."
32 They were now on the way to
Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead
of them. The disciples were ﬁlled with
dread and the people following behind
were overwhelmed with fear. Taking the
twelve disciples aside, Jesus once more
began to describe everything that was
about to happen to him in Jerusalem.
33 "When we get to Jerusalem," he told
them, "the Son of Man will be betrayed
to the leading priests and the teachers
of religious law. They will sentence him
to die and hand him over to the Romans.
34 They will mock him, spit on him, beat
him with their whips, and kill him, but
a er three days he will rise again."
35 Then James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, came over and spoke to him.MARK 10
68
"Teacher," they said, "we want you to do
us a favor."
36 "What is it?" he asked.
37 "In your glorious Kingdom, we want
to sit in places of honor next to you,"
they said, "one at your right and the
other at your le ."
38 But Jesus answered, "You don’t know
what you are asking! Are you able to
drink from the bi er cup of sorrow I
am about to drink? Are you able to be
bap zed with the bap sm of suﬀering I
must be bap zed with?"
39 "Oh yes," they said, "we are able!"
And Jesus said, "You will indeed drink
from my cup and be bap zed with my
bap sm,
40 but I have no right to say who will sit
on the thrones next to mine. God has
prepared those places for the ones he
has chosen."MARK 10
69
41 When the ten other disciples
discovered what James and John had
asked, they were indignant.
42 So Jesus called them together and
said, "You know that in this world kings
are tyrants, and oﬃcials lord it over the
people beneath them.
43 But among you it should be quite
diﬀerent. Whoever wants to be a leader
among you must be your servant,
44 and whoever wants to be ﬁrst must
be the slave of all.
45 For even I, the Son of Man, came
here not to be served but to serve
others, and to give my life as a ransom
for many."
46 And so they reached Jericho. Later, as
Jesus and his disciples le town, a great
crowd was following. A blind beggar
named Bar maeus (son of Timaeus)
was si ng beside the road as Jesus was
going by.MARK 10 – 11
47 When Bar
70
maeus heard that Jesus
from Nazareth was nearby, he began to
shout out, "Jesus, Son of David, have
mercy on me!"
48 "Be quiet!" some of the people yelled
at him. But he only shouted louder, "Son
of David, have mercy on me!"
49 When Jesus heard him, he stopped
and said, "Tell him to come here." So
they called the blind man. "Cheer up,"
they said. "Come on, he’s calling you!"
50 Bar maeus threw aside his coat,
jumped up, and came to Jesus.
51 "What do you want me to do for
you?" Jesus asked. "Teacher," the blind
man said, "I want to see!"
52 And Jesus said to him, "Go your
way. Your faith has healed you." And
instantly the blind man could see! Then
he followed Jesus down the road.
1 As Jesus and his disciples
approached Jerusalem, they
11MARK 11
71
came to the towns of Bethphage and
Bethany, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus
sent two of them on ahead.
2 "Go into that village over there," he
told them, "and as soon as you enter it,
you will see a colt ed there that has
never been ridden. Un e it and bring it
here.
3 If anyone asks what you are doing, just
say, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it
soon.’"
4 The two disciples le and found the
colt standing in the street, ed outside a
house.
5 As they were untying it, some
bystanders demanded, "What are you
doing, untying that colt?"
6 They said what Jesus had told them to
say, and they were permi ed to take it.
7 Then they brought the colt to Jesus
and threw their garments over it, and he
sat on it.MARK 11
72
8 Many in the crowd spread their coats
on the road ahead of Jesus, and others
cut leafy branches in the ﬁelds and
spread them along the way.
9 He was in the center of the procession,
and the crowds all around him were
shou ng, "Praise God! Bless the one
who comes in the name of the Lord!
10 Bless the coming kingdom of our
ancestor David! Praise God in highest
heaven!"
11 So Jesus came to Jerusalem and
went into the Temple. He looked around
carefully at everything, and then he le
because it was late in the a ernoon.
Then he went out to Bethany with the
twelve disciples.
12 The next morning as they were
leaving Bethany, Jesus felt hungry.
13 He no ced a ﬁg tree a li le way oﬀ
that was in full leaf, so he went over to
see if he could ﬁnd any ﬁgs on it. ButMARK 11
73
there were only leaves because it was
too early in the season for fruit.
14 Then Jesus said to the tree, "May no
one ever eat your fruit again!" And the
disciples heard him say it.
15 When they arrived back in Jerusalem,
Jesus entered the Temple and began
to drive out the merchants and their
customers. He knocked over the tables
of the money changers and the stalls of
those selling doves,
16 and he stopped everyone from
bringing in merchandise.
17 He taught them, "The Scriptures
declare, ‘My Temple will be called a
place of prayer for all na ons,’ but you
have turned it into a den of thieves."
18 When the leading priests and
teachers of religious law heard what
Jesus had done, they began planning
how to kill him. But they were afraidMARK 11
74
of him because the people were so
enthusias c about Jesus’ teaching.
19 That evening Jesus and the disciples
le the city.
20 The next morning as they passed by
the ﬁg tree he had cursed, the disciples
no ced it was withered from the roots.
21 Peter remembered what Jesus had
said to the tree on the previous day and
exclaimed, "Look, Teacher! The ﬁg tree
you cursed has withered!"
22 Then Jesus said to the disciples,
"Have faith in God.
23 I assure you that you can say to
this mountain, ‘May God li you up
and throw you into the sea,’ and your
command will be obeyed. All that’s
required is that you really believe and do
not doubt in your heart.
24 Listen to me! You can pray for
anything, and if you believe, you will
have it.MARK 11
75
25 But when you are praying, ﬁrst
forgive anyone you are holding a grudge
against, so that your Father in heaven
will forgive your sins, too."
26 [[EMPTY]]
27 By this me they had arrived in
Jerusalem again. As Jesus was walking
through the Temple area, the leading
priests, the teachers of religious law, and
the other leaders came up to him. They
demanded,
28 "By whose authority did you drive
out the merchants from the Temple?
Who gave you such authority?"
29 "I’ll tell who gave me authority
to do these things if you answer one
ques on," Jesus replied.
30 "Did John’s bap sm come from
heaven or was it merely human? Answer
me!"
31 They talked it over among
themselves. "If we say it was fromMARK 11 – 12
76
heaven, he will ask why we didn’t believe
him.
32 But do we dare say it was merely
human?" For they were afraid that the
people would start a riot, since everyone
thought that John was a prophet.
33 So they ﬁnally replied, "We don’t
know." And Jesus responded, "Then I
won’t answer your ques on either."
1 Then Jesus began telling
them stories: "A man planted a
vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a
pit for pressing out the grape juice, and
built a lookout tower. Then he leased the
vineyard to tenant farmers and moved
to another country.
2 At grape–picking me he sent one of
his servants to collect his share of the
crop.
3 But the farmers grabbed the servant,
beat him up, and sent him back
empty–handed.
12MARK 12
77
4 "The owner then sent another
servant, but they beat him over the head
and treated him shamefully.
5 The next servant he sent was killed.
Others who were sent were either
beaten or killed,
6 un l there was only one le ––his
son whom he loved dearly. The owner
ﬁnally sent him, thinking, ‘Surely they
will respect my son.’
7 "But the farmers said to one another,
‘Here comes the heir to this estate. Let’s
kill him and get the estate for ourselves!’
8 So they grabbed him and murdered
him and threw his body out of the
vineyard.
9 "What do you suppose the owner of
the vineyard will do?" Jesus asked. "I’ll
tell you––he will come and kill them all
and lease the vineyard to others.
10 Didn’t you ever read this in the
Scriptures? ‘The stone rejected byMARK 12
78
the builders has now become the
cornerstone.
11 This is the Lord’s doing, and it is
marvelous to see.’"
12 The Jewish leaders wanted to
arrest him for using this illustra on
because they realized he was poin ng at
them––they were the wicked farmers in
his story. But they were afraid to touch
him because of the crowds. So they le
him and went away.
13 The leaders sent some Pharisees and
supporters of Herod to try to trap Jesus
into saying something for which he could
be arrested.
14 "Teacher," these men said, "we know
how honest you are. You are impar al
and don’t play favorites. You sincerely
teach the ways of God. Now tell us––is
it right to pay taxes to the Roman
government or not?MARK 12
79
15 Should we pay them, or should we
not?" Jesus saw through their hypocrisy
and said, "Whom are you trying to fool
with your trick ques ons? Show me a
Roman coin, and I’ll tell you."
16 When they handed it to him, he
asked, "Whose picture and tle are
stamped on it?" "Caesar’s," they replied.
17 "Well, then," Jesus said, "give
to Caesar what belongs to him. But
everything that belongs to God must
be given to God." This reply completely
amazed them.
18 Then the Sadducees stepped
forward––a group of Jews who say there
is no resurrec on a er death. They
posed this ques on:
19 "Teacher, Moses gave us a law that
if a man dies, leaving a wife without
children, his brother should marry the
widow and have a child who will be the
brother’s heir.MARK 12
80
20 Well, there were seven brothers. The
oldest of them married and then died
without children.
21 So the second brother married the
widow, but soon he too died and le no
children. Then the next brother married
her and died without children.
22 This con nued un l all the brothers
had married her and died, and s ll there
were no children. Last of all, the woman
died, too.
23 So tell us, whose wife will she be
in the resurrec on? For all seven were
married to her."
24 Jesus replied, "Your problem is that
you don’t know the Scriptures, and you
don’t know the power of God.
25 For when the dead rise, they won’t
be married. They will be like the angels
in heaven.
26 But now, as to whether the dead
will be raised––haven’t you ever readMARK 12
81
about this in the wri ngs of Moses, in
the story of the burning bush? Long a er
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died,
God said to Moses, ‘I am the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob.’
27 So he is the God of the living, not the
dead. You have made a serious error."
28 One of the teachers of religious
law was standing there listening to the
discussion. He realized that Jesus had
answered well, so he asked, "Of all the
commandments, which is the most
important?"
29 Jesus replied, "The most important
commandment is this: ‘Hear, O Israel!
The Lord our God is the one and only
Lord.
30 And you must love the Lord your God
with all your heart, all your soul, all your
mind, and all your strength.’MARK 12
82
31 The second is equally important:
‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No
other commandment is greater than
these."
32 The teacher of religious law replied,
"Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the
truth by saying that there is only one
God and no other.
33 And I know it is important to love
him with all my heart and all my
understanding and all my strength, and
to love my neighbors as myself. This is
more important than to oﬀer all of the
burnt oﬀerings and sacriﬁces required in
the law."
34 Realizing this man’s understanding,
Jesus said to him, "You are not far from
the Kingdom of God." And a er that,
no one dared to ask him any more
ques ons.
35 Later, as Jesus was teaching the
people in the Temple, he asked, "Why doMARK 12
83
the teachers of religious law claim that
the Messiah will be the son of David?
36 For David himself, speaking under
the inspira on of the Holy Spirit, said,
‘The LORD said to my Lord, Sit in honor
at my right hand un l I humble your
enemies beneath your feet.’
37 Since David himself called him Lord,
how can he be his son at the same
me?" And the crowd listened to him
with great interest.
38 Here are some of the other things
he taught them at this me: "Beware of
these teachers of religious law! For they
love to parade in ﬂowing robes and to
have everyone bow to them as they walk
in the marketplaces.
39 And how they love the seats of honor
in the synagogues and at banquets.
40 But they shamelessly cheat widows
out of their property, and then, to
cover up the kind of people they reallyMARK 12 – 13
84
are, they make long prayers in public.
Because of this, their punishment will be
the greater."
41 Jesus went over to the collec on
box in the Temple and sat and watched
as the crowds dropped in their money.
Many rich people put in large amounts.
42 Then a poor widow came and
dropped in two pennies.
43 He called his disciples to him and
said, "I assure you, this poor widow has
given more than all the others have
given.
44 For they gave a ny part of their
surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given
everything she has."
1 As Jesus was leaving the Temple
that day, one of his disciples said,
"Teacher, look at these tremendous
buildings! Look at the massive stones in
the walls!"
13MARK 13
85
2 Jesus replied, "These magniﬁcent
buildings will be so completely
demolished that not one stone will be
le on top of another."
3 Later, Jesus sat on the slopes of the
Mount of Olives across the valley from
the Temple. Peter, James, John, and
Andrew came to him privately and asked
him,
4 "When will all this take place? And will
there be any sign ahead of me to show
us when all this will be fulﬁlled?"
5 Jesus replied, "Don’t let anyone
mislead you,
6 because many will come in my name,
claiming to be the Messiah. They will
lead many astray.
7 And wars will break out near and
far, but don’t panic. Yes, these things
must come, but the end won’t follow
immediately.MARK 13
8 Na
86
ons and kingdoms will proclaim
war against each other, and there will be
earthquakes in many parts of the world,
and famines. But all this will be only the
beginning of the horrors to come.
9 But when these things begin to
happen, watch out! You will be handed
over to the courts and beaten in
the synagogues. You will be accused
before governors and kings of being my
followers. This will be your opportunity
to tell them about me.
10 And the Good News must ﬁrst be
preached to every na on.
11 But when you are arrested and stand
trial, don’t worry about what to say in
your defense. Just say what God tells
you to. Then it is not you who will be
speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
12 "Brother will betray brother to death,
fathers will betray their own children,MARK 13
87
and children will rise against their
parents and cause them to be killed.
13 And everyone will hate you because
of your allegiance to me. But those who
endure to the end will be saved.
14 "The me will come when you will
see the sacrilegious object that causes
desecra on standing where it should not
be"––reader, pay a en on! "Then those
in Judea must ﬂee to the hills.
15 A person outside the house must not
go back into the house to pack.
16 A person in the ﬁeld must not return
even to get a coat.
17 How terrible it will be for pregnant
women and for mothers nursing their
babies in those days.
18 And pray that your ﬂight will not be
in winter.
19 For those will be days of greater
horror than at any me since GodMARK 13
88
created the world. And it will never
happen again.
20 In fact, unless the Lord shortens that
me of calamity, the en re human race
will be destroyed. But for the sake of
his chosen ones he has shortened those
days.
21 "And then if anyone tells you, ‘Look,
here is the Messiah,’ or, ‘There he is,’
don’t pay any a en on.
22 For false messiahs and false prophets
will rise up and perform miraculous
signs and wonders so as to deceive, if
possible, even God’s chosen ones.
23 Watch out! I have warned you!
24 "At that me, a er those horrible
days end, the sun will be darkened, the
moon will not give light,
25 the stars will fall from the sky, and
the powers of heaven will be shaken.MARK 13
89
26 Then everyone will see the Son of
Man arrive on the clouds with great
power and glory.
27 And he will send forth his angels to
gather together his chosen ones from all
over the world––from the farthest ends
of the earth and heaven.
28 "Now, learn a lesson from the ﬁg
tree. When its buds become tender and
its leaves begin to sprout, you know
without being told that summer is near.
29 Just so, when you see the events I’ve
described beginning to happen, you can
be sure that his return is very near, right
at the door.
30 I assure you, this genera on will
not pass from the scene un l all these
events have taken place.
31 Heaven and earth will disappear, but
my words will remain forever.
32 "However, no one knows the day or
hour when these things will happen, notMARK 13 – 14
90
even the angels in heaven or the Son
himself. Only the Father knows.
33 And since you don’t know when they
will happen, stay alert and keep watch.
34 "The coming of the Son of Man can
be compared with that of a man who
le home to go on a trip. He gave each
of his employees instruc ons about the
work they were to do, and he told the
gatekeeper to watch for his return.
35 So keep a sharp lookout! For you
do not know when the homeowner
will return––at evening, midnight, early
dawn, or late daybreak.
36 Don’t let him ﬁnd you sleeping when
he arrives without warning.
37 What I say to you I say to everyone:
Watch for his return!"
1 It was now two days before
the Passover celebra on and
the Fes val of Unleavened Bread. The
leading priests and the teachers of
14MARK 14
91
religious law were s ll looking for an
opportunity to capture Jesus secretly
and put him to death.
2 "But not during the Passover," they
agreed, "or there will be a riot."
3 Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at
the home of Simon, a man who had
leprosy. During supper, a woman came
in with a beau ful jar of expensive
perfume. She broke the seal and poured
the perfume over his head.
4 Some of those at the table were
indignant. "Why was this expensive
perfume wasted?" they asked.
5 "She could have sold it for a small
fortune and given the money to the
poor!" And they scolded her harshly.
6 But Jesus replied, "Leave her alone.
Why berate her for doing such a good
thing to me?
7 You will always have the poor among
you, and you can help them wheneverMARK 14
92
you want to. But I will not be here with
you much longer.
8 She has done what she could and has
anointed my body for burial ahead of
me.
9 I assure you, wherever the Good News
is preached throughout the world, this
woman’s deed will be talked about in
her memory."
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve
disciples, went to the leading priests to
arrange to betray Jesus to them.
11 The leading priests were delighted
when they heard why he had come,
and they promised him a reward. So
he began looking for the right me and
place to betray Jesus.
12 On the ﬁrst day of the Fes val of
Unleavened Bread (the day the Passover
lambs were sacriﬁced), Jesus’ disciples
asked him, "Where do you want us to go
to prepare the Passover supper?"MARK 14
93
13 So Jesus sent two of them into
Jerusalem to make the arrangements.
"As you go into the city," he told them,
"a man carrying a pitcher of water will
meet you. Follow him.
14 At the house he enters, say to the
owner, ‘The Teacher asks, Where is the
guest room where I can eat the Passover
meal with my disciples?’
15 He will take you upstairs to a large
room that is already set up. That is the
place; go ahead and prepare our supper
there."
16 So the two disciples went on ahead
into the city and found everything just
as Jesus had said, and they prepared the
Passover supper there.
17 In the evening Jesus arrived with the
twelve disciples.
18 As they were si ng around the table
ea ng, Jesus said, "The truth is, one ofMARK 14
94
you will betray me, one of you who is
here ea ng with me."
19 Greatly distressed, one by one they
began to ask him, "I’m not the one, am
I?"
20 He replied, "It is one of you twelve,
one who is ea ng with me now.
21 For I, the Son of Man, must die, as
the Scriptures declared long ago. But
how terrible it will be for my betrayer.
Far be er for him if he had never been
born!"
22 As they were ea ng, Jesus took a loaf
of bread and asked God’s blessing on it.
Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to
the disciples, saying, "Take it, for this is
my body."
23 And he took a cup of wine and gave
thanks to God for it. He gave it to them,
and they all drank from it.MARK 14
95
24 And he said to them, "This is my
blood, poured out for many, sealing the
covenant between God and his people.
25 I solemnly declare that I will not drink
wine again un l that day when I drink it
new in the Kingdom of God."
26 Then they sang a hymn and went out
to the Mount of Olives.
27 "All of you will desert me," Jesus told
them. "For the Scriptures say, ‘God will
strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will
be sca ered.’
28 But a er I am raised from the dead, I
will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet
you there."
29 Peter said to him, "Even if everyone
else deserts you, I never will."
30 "Peter," Jesus replied, "the truth is,
this very night, before the rooster crows
twice, you will deny me three mes."
31 "No!" Peter insisted. "Not even if I
have to die with you! I will never denyMARK 14
96
you!" And all the others vowed the
same.
32 And they came to an olive grove
called Gethsemane, and Jesus said, "Sit
here while I go and pray."
33 He took Peter, James, and John with
him, and he began to be ﬁlled with
horror and deep distress.
34 He told them, "My soul is crushed
with grief to the point of death. Stay
here and watch with me."
35 He went on a li le farther and fell
face down on the ground. He prayed
that, if it were possible, the awful hour
awai ng him might pass him by.
36 "Abba, Father," he said, "everything
is possible for you. Please take this cup
of suﬀering away from me. Yet I want
your will, not mine."
37 Then he returned and found the
disciples asleep. "Simon!" he said to
Peter. "Are you asleep? Couldn’t youMARK 14
97
stay awake and watch with me even one
hour?
38 Keep alert and pray. Otherwise
tempta on will overpower you. For
though the spirit is willing enough, the
body is weak."
39 Then Jesus le them again and
prayed, repea ng his pleadings.
40 Again he returned to them and found
them sleeping, for they just couldn’t
keep their eyes open. And they didn’t
know what to say.
41 When he returned to them the
third me, he said, "S ll sleeping? S ll
res ng? Enough! The me has come. I,
the Son of Man, am betrayed into the
hands of sinners.
42 Up, let’s be going. See, my betrayer is
here!"
43 And immediately, as he said this,
Judas, one of the twelve disciples,
arrived with a mob that was armed withMARK 14
98
swords and clubs. They had been sent
out by the leading priests, the teachers
of religious law, and the other leaders.
44 Judas had given them a prearranged
signal: "You will know which one to
arrest when I go over and give him the
kiss of gree ng. Then you can take him
away under guard."
45 As soon as they arrived, Judas walked
up to Jesus. "Teacher!" he exclaimed,
and gave him the kiss.
46 Then the others grabbed Jesus and
arrested him.
47 But someone pulled out a sword and
slashed oﬀ an ear of the high priest’s
servant.
48 Jesus asked them, "Am I some
dangerous criminal, that you come
armed with swords and clubs to arrest
me?
49 Why didn’t you arrest me in the
Temple? I was there teaching every day.MARK 14
99
But these things are happening to fulﬁll
what the Scriptures say about me."
50 Meanwhile, all his disciples deserted
him and ran away.
51 There was a young man following
along behind, clothed only in a linen
nightshirt. When the mob tried to grab
him,
52 they tore oﬀ his clothes, but he
escaped and ran away naked.
53 Jesus was led to the high priest’s
home where the leading priests, other
leaders, and teachers of religious law
had gathered.
54 Meanwhile, Peter followed far
behind and then slipped inside the gates
of the high priest’s courtyard. For a while
he sat with the guards, warming himself
by the ﬁre.
55 Inside, the leading priests and the
en re high council were trying to ﬁnd
witnesses who would tes fy againstMARK 14
100
Jesus, so they could put him to death.
But their eﬀorts were in vain.
56 Many false witnesses spoke against
him, but they contradicted each other.
57 Finally, some men stood up to tes fy
against him with this lie:
58 "We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this
Temple made with human hands, and
in three days I will build another, made
without human hands.’"
59 But even then they didn’t get their
stories straight!
60 Then the high priest stood up before
the others and asked Jesus, "Well, aren’t
you going to answer these charges?
What do you have to say for yourself?"
61 Jesus made no reply. Then the high
priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah,
the Son of the blessed God?"
62 Jesus said, "I am, and you will see
me, the Son of Man, si ng at God’s rightMARK 14
101
hand in the place of power and coming
back on the clouds of heaven."
63 Then the high priest tore his clothing
to show his horror and said, "Why do we
need other witnesses?
64 You have all heard his blasphemy.
What is your verdict?" And they all
condemned him to death.
65 Then some of them began to spit at
him, and they blindfolded him and hit
his face with their ﬁsts. "Who hit you
that me, you prophet?" they jeered.
And even the guards were hi ng him as
they led him away.
66 Meanwhile, Peter was below in the
courtyard. One of the servant girls who
worked for the high priest
67 no ced Peter warming himself at the
ﬁre. She looked at him closely and then
said, "You were one of those with Jesus,
the Nazarene."MARK 14 – 15
102
68 Peter denied it. "I don’t know what
you’re talking about," he said, and he
went out into the entryway. Just then, a
rooster crowed.
69 The servant girl saw him standing
there and began telling the others, "That
man is deﬁnitely one of them!"
70 Peter denied it again. A li le later
some other bystanders began saying to
Peter, "You must be one of them because
you are from Galilee."
71 Peter said, "I swear by God, I don’t
know this man you’re talking about."
72 And immediately the rooster crowed
the second me. Suddenly, Jesus’ words
ﬂashed through Peter’s mind: "Before
the rooster crows twice, you will deny
me three mes." And he broke down
and cried.
1 Very early in the morning the
leading priests, other leaders,
and teachers of religious law––the en re
15MARK 15
103
high council ––met to discuss their next
step. They bound Jesus and took him to
Pilate, the Roman governor.
2 Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the King
of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as
you say."
3 Then the leading priests accused him
of many crimes,
4 and Pilate asked him, "Aren’t you
going to say something? What about all
these charges against you?"
5 But Jesus said nothing, much to
Pilate’s surprise.
6 Now it was the governor’s custom
to release one prisoner each year at
Passover me––anyone the people
requested.
7 One of the prisoners at that me was
Barabbas, convicted along with others
for murder during an insurrec on.MARK 15
104
8 The mob began to crowd in toward
Pilate, asking him to release a prisoner
as usual.
9 "Should I give you the King of the
Jews?" Pilate asked.
10 (For he realized by now that the
leading priests had arrested Jesus out of
envy.)
11 But at this point the leading priests
s rred up the mob to demand the
release of Barabbas instead of Jesus.
12 "But if I release Barabbas," Pilate
asked them, "what should I do with this
man you call the King of the Jews?"
13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
14 "Why?" Pilate demanded. "What
crime has he commi ed?" But the crowd
only roared the louder, "Crucify him!"
15 So Pilate, anxious to please the
crowd, released Barabbas to them.
He ordered Jesus ﬂogged with a lead–MARK 15
105
pped whip, then turned him over to
the Roman soldiers to crucify him.
16 The soldiers took him into their
headquarters and called out the en re
ba alion.
17 They dressed him in a purple robe
and made a crown of long, sharp thorns
and put it on his head.
18 Then they saluted, yelling, "Hail! King
of the Jews!"
19 And they beat him on the head with
a s ck, spit on him, and dropped to their
knees in mock worship.
20 When they were ﬁnally red of
mocking him, they took oﬀ the purple
robe and put his own clothes on him
again. Then they led him away to be
cruciﬁed.
21 A man named Simon, who was from
Cyrene, was coming in from the country
just then, and they forced him to carryMARK 15
106
Jesus’ cross. (Simon is the father of
Alexander and Rufus.)
22 And they brought Jesus to a place
called Golgotha (which means Skull Hill).
23 They oﬀered him wine drugged with
myrrh, but he refused it.
24 Then they nailed him to the cross.
They gambled for his clothes, throwing
dice to decide who would get them.
25 It was nine o’clock in the morning
when the cruciﬁxion took place.
26 A signboard was fastened to the
cross above Jesus’ head, announcing the
charge against him. It read: "The King of
the Jews."
27 Two criminals were cruciﬁed with
him, their crosses on either side of his.
28 [[EMPTY]]
29 And the people passing by shouted
abuse, shaking their heads in mockery.
"Ha! Look at you now!" they yelled atMARK 15
107
him. "You can destroy the Temple and
rebuild it in three days, can you?
30 Well then, save yourself and come
down from the cross!"
31 The leading priests and teachers of
religious law also mocked Jesus. "He
saved others," they scoﬀed, "but he
can’t save himself!
32 Let this Messiah, this king of Israel,
come down from the cross so we can
see it and believe him!" Even the two
criminals who were being cruciﬁed with
Jesus ridiculed him.
33 At noon, darkness fell across the
whole land un l three o’clock.
34 Then, at that me Jesus called out
with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema
sabachthani?" which means, "My God,
my God, why have you forsaken me?"
35 Some of the bystanders
misunderstood and thought he
was calling for the prophet Elijah.MARK 15
108
36 One of them ran and ﬁlled a sponge
with sour wine, holding it up to him on
a s ck so he could drink. "Leave him
alone. Let’s see whether Elijah will come
and take him down!" he said.
37 Then Jesus u ered another loud cry
and breathed his last.
38 And the curtain in the Temple was
torn in two, from top to bo om.
39 When the Roman oﬃcer who stood
facing him saw how he had died, he
exclaimed, "Truly, this was the Son of
God!"
40 Some women were there, watching
from a distance, including Mary
Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James
the younger and of Joseph), and Salome.
41 They had been followers of Jesus
and had cared for him while he was
in Galilee. Then they and many other
women had come with him to Jerusalem.MARK 15
109
42 This all happened on Friday, the
day of prepara on, the day before the
Sabbath. As evening approached,
43 an honored member of the high
council, Joseph from Arimathea (who
was wai ng for the Kingdom of God to
come), gathered his courage and went
to Pilate to ask for Jesus’ body.
44 Pilate couldn’t believe that Jesus was
already dead, so he called for the Roman
military oﬃcer in charge and asked him.
45 The oﬃcer conﬁrmed the fact, and
Pilate told Joseph he could have the
body.
46 Joseph bought a long sheet of linen
cloth, and taking Jesus’ body down from
the cross, he wrapped it in the cloth and
laid it in a tomb that had been carved
out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone in
front of the entrance.MARK 15 – 16
110
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Joseph saw where Jesus’ body
was laid.
1 The next evening, when the
Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene
and Salome and Mary the mother of
James went out and purchased burial
spices to put on Jesus’ body.
2 Very early on Sunday morning, just at
sunrise, they came to the tomb.
3 On the way they were discussing who
would roll the stone away from the
entrance to the tomb.
4 But when they arrived, they looked
up and saw that the stone––a very large
one––had already been rolled aside.
5 So they entered the tomb, and there
on the right sat a young man clothed in
a white robe. The women were startled,
6 but the angel said, "Do not be so
surprised. You are looking for Jesus, the
Nazarene, who was cruciﬁed. He isn’t
16MARK 16
111
here! He has been raised from the dead!
Look, this is where they laid his body.
7 Now go and give this message to his
disciples, including Peter: Jesus is going
ahead of you to Galilee. You will see
him there, just as he told you before he
died!"
8 The women ﬂed from the tomb,
trembling and bewildered, saying
nothing to anyone because they were
too frightened to talk. Then they
reported all these instruc ons brieﬂy to
Peter and his companions. A erward
Jesus himself sent them out from east
to west with the sacred and unfailing
message of salva on that gives eternal
life. Amen.
9 It was early on Sunday morning
when Jesus rose from the dead, and
the ﬁrst person who saw him was Mary
Magdalene, the woman from whom he
had cast out seven demons.MARK 16
112
10 She went and found the disciples,
who were grieving and weeping.
11 But when she told them that Jesus
was alive and she had seen him, they
didn’t believe her.
12 A erward he appeared to two who
were walking from Jerusalem into the
country, but they didn’t recognize him
at ﬁrst because he had changed his
appearance.
13 When they realized who he was, they
rushed back to tell the others, but no
one believed them.
14 S ll later he appeared to the eleven
disciples as they were ea ng together.
He rebuked them for their unbelief––
their stubborn refusal to believe those
who had seen him a er he had risen.
15 And then he told them, "Go into all
the world and preach the Good News to
everyone, everywhere.MARK 16
16 Anyone who believes and is bap
113
zed
will be saved. But anyone who refuses to
believe will be condemned.
17 These signs will accompany those
who believe: They will cast out demons
in my name, and they will speak new
languages.
18 They will be able to handle snakes
with safety, and if they drink anything
poisonous, it won’t hurt them. They will
be able to place their hands on the sick
and heal them."
19 When the Lord Jesus had ﬁnished
talking with them, he was taken up into
heaven and sat down in the place of
honor at God’s right hand.
20 And the disciples went everywhere
and preached, and the Lord worked
with them, conﬁrming what they said by
many miraculous signs.Luke
1
1 Most honorable Theophilus: Many
people have wri en accounts about
the events that took place among us.
2 They used as their source material the
reports circula ng among us from the
early disciples and other eyewitnesses
of what God has done in fulﬁllment of
his promises.
3 Having carefully inves gated all of
these accounts from the beginning, I
have decided to write a careful summary
for you,
4 to reassure you of the truth of all you
were taught.
5 It all begins with a Jewish priest,
Zechariah, who lived when Herod was
king of Judea. Zechariah was a member
of the priestly order of Abijah. His wife,LUKE 1
2
Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line
of Aaron.
6 Zechariah and Elizabeth were
righteous in God’s eyes, careful to obey
all of the Lord’s commandments and
regula ons.
7 They had no children because
Elizabeth was barren, and now they
were both very old.
8 One day Zechariah was serving God
in the Temple, for his order was on duty
that week.
9 As was the custom of the priests, he
was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary
and burn incense in the Lord’s presence.
10 While the incense was being burned,
a great crowd stood outside, praying.
11 Zechariah was in the sanctuary when
an angel of the Lord appeared, standing
to the right of the incense altar.
12 Zechariah was overwhelmed with
fear.LUKE 1
3
13 But the angel said, "Don’t be afraid,
Zechariah! For God has heard your
prayer, and your wife, Elizabeth, will
bear you a son! And you are to name
him John.
14 You will have great joy and gladness,
and many will rejoice with you at his
birth,
15 for he will be great in the eyes of the
Lord. He must never touch wine or hard
liquor, and he will be ﬁlled with the Holy
Spirit, even before his birth.
16 And he will persuade many Israelites
to turn to the Lord their God.
17 He will be a man with the spirit and
power of Elijah, the prophet of old. He
will precede the coming of the Lord,
preparing the people for his arrival. He
will turn the hearts of the fathers to their
children, and he will change disobedient
minds to accept godly wisdom."LUKE 1
4
18 Zechariah said to the angel, "How
can I know this will happen? I’m an old
man now, and my wife is also well along
in years."
19 Then the angel said, "I am Gabriel! I
stand in the very presence of God. It was
he who sent me to bring you this good
news!
20 And now, since you didn’t believe
what I said, you won’t be able to speak
un l the child is born. For my words will
certainly come true at the proper me."
21 Meanwhile, the people were wai ng
for Zechariah to come out, wondering
why he was taking so long.
22 When he ﬁnally did come out, he
couldn’t speak to them. Then they
realized from his gestures that he
must have seen a vision in the Temple
sanctuary.LUKE 1
23 He stayed at the Temple un
5
l his
term of service was over, and then he
returned home.
24 Soon a erward his wife, Elizabeth,
became pregnant and went into
seclusion for ﬁve months.
25 "How kind the Lord is!" she
exclaimed. "He has taken away my
disgrace of having no children!"
26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s
pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to
Nazareth, a village in Galilee,
27 to a virgin named Mary. She was
engaged to be married to a man named
Joseph, a descendant of King David.
28 Gabriel appeared to her and said,
"Gree ngs, favored woman! The Lord is
with you!"
29 Confused and disturbed, Mary tried
to think what the angel could mean.LUKE 1
6
30 "Don’t be frightened, Mary," the
angel told her, "for God has decided to
bless you!
31 You will become pregnant and have a
son, and you are to name him Jesus.
32 He will be very great and will be
called the Son of the Most High. And the
Lord God will give him the throne of his
ancestor David.
33 And he will reign over Israel forever;
his Kingdom will never end!"
34 Mary asked the angel, "But how can I
have a baby? I am a virgin."
35 The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit
will come upon you, and the power of
the Most High will overshadow you. So
the baby born to you will be holy, and he
will be called the Son of God.
36 What’s more, your rela ve Elizabeth
has become pregnant in her old age!
People used to say she was barren, but
she’s already in her sixth month.LUKE 1
7
37 For nothing is impossible with God."
38 Mary responded, "I am the Lord’s
servant, and I am willing to accept
whatever he wants. May everything you
have said come true." And then the
angel le .
39 A few days later Mary hurried to the
hill country of Judea, to the town
40 where Zechariah lived. She entered
the house and greeted Elizabeth.
41 At the sound of Mary’s gree ng,
Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and
Elizabeth was ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit.
42 Elizabeth gave a glad cry and
exclaimed to Mary, "You are blessed by
God above all other women, and your
child is blessed.
43 What an honor this is, that the
mother of my Lord should visit me!
44 When you came in and greeted me,
my baby jumped for joy the instant I
heard your voice!LUKE 1
8
45 You are blessed, because you
believed that the Lord would do what he
said."
46 Mary responded, "Oh, how I praise
the Lord.
47 How I rejoice in God my Savior!
48 For he took no ce of his lowly
servant girl, and now genera on a er
genera on will call me blessed.
49 For he, the Mighty One, is holy, and
he has done great things for me.
50 His mercy goes on from genera on
to genera on, to all who fear him.
51 His mighty arm does tremendous
things! How he sca ers the proud and
haughty ones!
52 He has taken princes from their
thrones and exalted the lowly.
53 He has sa sﬁed the hungry with
good things and sent the rich away with
empty hands.LUKE 1
9
54 And how he has helped his servant
Israel! He has not forgo en his promise
to be merciful.
55 For he promised our ancestors–
–Abraham and his children––to be
merciful to them forever."
56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about
three months and then went back to her
own home.
57 Now it was me for Elizabeth’s baby
to be born, and it was a boy.
58 The word spread quickly to her
neighbors and rela ves that the Lord
had been very kind to her, and everyone
rejoiced with her.
59 When the baby was eight days old,
all the rela ves and friends came for the
circumcision ceremony. They wanted to
name him Zechariah, a er his father.
60 But Elizabeth said, "No! His name is
John!"LUKE 1
10
61 "What?" they exclaimed. "There is no
one in all your family by that name."
62 So they asked the baby’s father,
communica ng to him by making
gestures.
63 He mo oned for a wri ng tablet, and
to everyone’s surprise he wrote, "His
name is John!"
64 Instantly Zechariah could speak
again, and he began praising God.
65 Wonder fell upon the whole
neighborhood, and the news of what
had happened spread throughout the
Judean hills.
66 Everyone who heard about it
reﬂected on these events and asked, "I
wonder what this child will turn out to
be? For the hand of the Lord is surely
upon him in a special way."
67 Then his father, Zechariah, was
ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit and gave this
prophecy:LUKE 1
11
68 "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
because he has visited his people and
redeemed them.
69 He has sent us a mighty Savior from
the royal line of his servant David,
70 just as he promised through his holy
prophets long ago.
71 Now we will be saved from our
enemies and from all who hate us.
72 He has been merciful to our ancestors
by remembering his sacred covenant
with them,
73 the covenant he gave to our ancestor
Abraham.
74 We have been rescued from our
enemies, so we can serve God without
fear,
75 in holiness and righteousness forever.
76 "And you, my li le son, will be called
the prophet of the Most High, because
you will prepare the way for the Lord.LUKE 1 – 2
12
77 You will tell his people how to ﬁnd
salva on through forgiveness of their
sins.
78 Because of God’s tender mercy, the
light from heaven is about to break upon
us,
79 to give light to those who sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death,
and to guide us to the path of peace."
80 John grew up and became strong in
spirit. Then he lived out in the wilderness
un l he began his public ministry to
Israel.
1 At that me the Roman emperor,
Augustus, decreed that a census
should be taken throughout the Roman
Empire.
2 (This was the ﬁrst census taken when
Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
3 All returned to their own towns to
register for this census.
2LUKE 2
13
4 And because Joseph was a descendant
of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem
in Judea, David’s ancient home. He
traveled there from the village of
Nazareth in Galilee.
5 He took with him Mary, his ﬁanc‚e,
who was obviously pregnant by this
me.
6 And while they were there, the me
came for her baby to be born.
7 She gave birth to her ﬁrst child, a son.
She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth
and laid him in a manger, because there
was no room for them in the village inn.
8 That night some shepherds were in
the ﬁelds outside the village, guarding
their ﬂocks of sheep.
9 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord
appeared among them, and the radiance
of the Lord’s glory surrounded them.
They were terribly frightened,LUKE 2
14
10 but the angel reassured them. "Don’t
be afraid!" he said. "I bring you good
news of great joy for everyone!
11 The Savior––yes, the Messiah,
the Lord––has been born tonight in
Bethlehem, the city of David!
12 And this is how you will recognize
him: You will ﬁnd a baby lying in a
manger, wrapped snugly in strips of
cloth!"
13 Suddenly, the angel was joined by
a vast host of others––the armies of
heaven––praising God:
14 "Glory to God in the highest heaven,
and peace on earth to all whom God
favors."
15 When the angels had returned to
heaven, the shepherds said to each
other, "Come on, let’s go to Bethlehem!
Let’s see this wonderful thing that has
happened, which the Lord has told us
about."LUKE 2
15
16 They ran to the village and found
Mary and Joseph. And there was the
baby, lying in the manger.
17 Then the shepherds told everyone
what had happened and what the angel
had said to them about this child.
18 All who heard the shepherds’ story
were astonished,
19 but Mary quietly treasured these
things in her heart and thought about
them o en.
20 The shepherds went back to their
ﬁelds and ﬂocks, glorifying and praising
God for what the angels had told them,
and because they had seen the child,
just as the angel had said.
21 Eight days later, when the baby
was circumcised, he was named Jesus,
the name given him by the angel even
before he was conceived.
22 Then it was me for the puriﬁca on
oﬀering, as required by the law of MosesLUKE 2
16
a er the birth of a child; so his parents
took him to Jerusalem to present him to
the Lord.
23 The law of the Lord says, "If a
woman’s ﬁrst child is a boy, he must be
dedicated to the Lord."
24 So they oﬀered a sacriﬁce according
to what was required in the law of the
Lord––"either a pair of turtledoves or
two young pigeons."
25 Now there was a man named Simeon
who lived in Jerusalem. He was a
righteous man and very devout. He was
ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit, and he eagerly
expected the Messiah to come and
rescue Israel.
26 The Holy Spirit had revealed to him
that he would not die un l he had seen
the Lord’s Messiah.
27 That day the Spirit led him to the
Temple. So when Mary and Joseph cameLUKE 2
17
to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as
the law required,
28 Simeon was there. He took the child
in his arms and praised God, saying,
29 "Lord, now I can die in peace! As you
promised me,
30 I have seen the Savior
31 you have given to all people.
32 He is a light to reveal God to the
na ons, and he is the glory of your
people Israel!"
33 Joseph and Mary were amazed at
what was being said about Jesus.
34 Then Simeon blessed them, and he
said to Mary, "This child will be rejected
by many in Israel, and it will be their
undoing. But he will be the greatest joy
to many others.
35 Thus, the deepest thoughts of many
hearts will be revealed. And a sword will
pierce your very soul."LUKE 2
18
36 Anna, a prophet, was also there
in the Temple. She was the daughter
of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, and
was very old. She was a widow, for her
husband had died when they had been
married only seven years.
37 She was now eighty–four years old.
She never le the Temple but stayed
there day and night, worshiping God
with fas ng and prayer.
38 She came along just as Simeon was
talking with Mary and Joseph, and she
began praising God. She talked about
Jesus to everyone who had been wai ng
for the promised King to come and
deliver Jerusalem.
39 When Jesus’ parents had fulﬁlled
all the requirements of the law of the
Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in
Galilee.
40 There the child grew up healthy
and strong. He was ﬁlled with wisdomLUKE 2
19
beyond his years, and God placed his
special favor upon him.
41 Every year Jesus’ parents went to
Jerusalem for the Passover fes val.
42 When Jesus was twelve years old,
they a ended the fes val as usual.
43 A er the celebra on was over, they
started home to Nazareth, but Jesus
stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents
didn’t miss him at ﬁrst,
44 because they assumed he was with
friends among the other travelers. But
when he didn’t show up that evening,
they started to look for him among their
rela ves and friends.
45 When they couldn’t ﬁnd him, they
went back to Jerusalem to search for
him there.
46 Three days later they ﬁnally
discovered him. He was in the Temple,
si ng among the religious teachers,
discussing deep ques ons with them.LUKE 2 – 3
20
47 And all who heard him were amazed
at his understanding and his answers.
48 His parents didn’t know what to
think. "Son!" his mother said to him.
"Why have you done this to us? Your
father and I have been fran c, searching
for you everywhere."
49 "But why did you need to search?"
he asked. "You should have known that I
would be in my Father’s house."
50 But they didn’t understand what he
meant.
51 Then he returned to Nazareth with
them and was obedient to them; and
his mother stored all these things in her
heart.
52 So Jesus grew both in height and in
wisdom, and he was loved by God and
by all who knew him.
1 It was now the ﬁ eenth year of
the reign of Tiberius, the Roman
emperor. Pilate was governor over
3LUKE 3
21
Judea; Herod An pas was ruler over
Galilee; his brother Philip was ruler over
Iturea and Traconi s; Lysanias was ruler
over Abilene.
2 Annas and Caiaphas were the high
priests. At this me a message from God
came to John son of Zechariah, who was
living out in the wilderness.
3 Then John went from place to place on
both sides of the Jordan River, preaching
that people should be bap zed to show
that they had turned from their sins and
turned to God to be forgiven.
4 Isaiah had spoken of John when he
said, "He is a voice shou ng in the
wilderness: ‘Prepare a pathway for the
Lord’s coming! Make a straight road for
him!
5 Fill in the valleys, and level the
mountains and hills! Straighten the
curves, and smooth out the rough
places!LUKE 3
22
6 And then all people will see the
salva on sent from God.’"
7 Here is a sample of John’s preaching
to the crowds that came for bap sm:
"You brood of snakes! Who warned you
to ﬂee God’s coming judgment?
8 Prove by the way you live that you
have really turned from your sins
and turned to God. Don’t just say,
‘We’re safe––we’re the descendants of
Abraham.’ That proves nothing. God can
change these stones here into children
of Abraham.
9 Even now the ax of God’s judgment is
poised, ready to sever your roots. Yes,
every tree that does not produce good
fruit will be chopped down and thrown
into the ﬁre."
10 The crowd asked, "What should we
do?"LUKE 3
23
11 John replied, "If you have two coats,
give one to the poor. If you have food,
share it with those who are hungry."
12 Even corrupt tax collectors came to
be bap zed and asked, "Teacher, what
should we do?"
13 "Show your honesty," he replied.
"Make sure you collect no more taxes
than the Roman government requires
you to."
14 "What should we do?" asked some
soldiers. John replied, "Don’t extort
money, and don’t accuse people of
things you know they didn’t do. And be
content with your pay."
15 Everyone was expec ng the Messiah
to come soon, and they were eager
to know whether John might be the
Messiah.
16 John answered their ques ons
by saying, "I bap ze with water; but
someone is coming soon who is greaterLUKE 3
24
than I am––so much greater that I am
not even worthy to be his slave. He will
bap ze you with the Holy Spirit and with
ﬁre.
17 He is ready to separate the chaﬀ
from the grain with his winnowing fork.
Then he will clean up the threshing area,
storing the grain in his barn but burning
the chaﬀ with never–ending ﬁre."
18 John used many such warnings as
he announced the Good News to the
people.
19 John also publicly cri cized Herod
An pas, ruler of Galilee, for marrying
Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for
many other wrongs he had done.
20 So Herod put John in prison, adding
this sin to his many others.
21 One day when the crowds were being
bap zed, Jesus himself was bap zed. As
he was praying, the heavens opened,LUKE 3
25
22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him
in the form of a dove. And a voice from
heaven said, "You are my beloved Son,
and I am fully pleased with you."
23 Jesus was about thirty years old
when he began his public ministry. Jesus
was known as the son of Joseph. Joseph
was the son of Heli.
24 Heli was the son of Ma hat. Ma hat
was the son of Levi. Levi was the son
of Melki. Melki was the son of Jannai.
Jannai was the son of Joseph.
25 Joseph was the son of Ma athias.
Ma athias was the son of Amos. Amos
was the son of Nahum. Nahum was the
son of Esli. Esli was the son of Naggai.

1 Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,
le the Jordan River. He was led by
the Spirit to go out into the wilderness,
2 where the Devil tempted him for forty
days. He ate nothing all that me and
was very hungry.
3 Then the Devil said to him, "If you are
the Son of God, change this stone into a
loaf of bread."
4 But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures
say, ‘People need more than bread for
their life.’"
4LUKE 4
29
5 Then the Devil took him up and
revealed to him all the kingdoms of the
world in a moment of me.
6 The Devil told him, "I will give you the
glory of these kingdoms and authority
over them––because they are mine to
give to anyone I please.
7 I will give it all to you if you will bow
down and worship me."
8 Jesus replied, "The Scriptures say, ‘You
must worship the Lord your God; serve
only him.’"
9 Then the Devil took him to Jerusalem,
to the highest point of the Temple, and
said, "If you are the Son of God, jump
oﬀ!
10 For the Scriptures say, ‘He orders his
angels to protect and guard you.
11 And they will hold you with their
hands to keep you from striking your
foot on a stone.’"LUKE 4
30
12 Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also
say, ‘Do not test the Lord your God.’"
13 When the Devil had ﬁnished
temp ng Jesus, he le him un l the next
opportunity came.
14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee, ﬁlled
with the Holy Spirit’s power. Soon he
became well known throughout the
surrounding country.
15 He taught in their synagogues and
was praised by everyone.
16 When he came to the village of
Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as
usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath
and stood up to read the Scriptures.
17 The scroll containing the messages of
Isaiah the prophet was handed to him,
and he unrolled the scroll to the place
where it says:
18 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
for he has appointed me to preach
Good News to the poor. He has sentLUKE 4
31
me to proclaim that cap ves will be
released, that the blind will see, that the
downtrodden will be freed from their
oppressors,
19 and that the me of the Lord’s favor
has come."
20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it
back to the a endant, and sat down.
Everyone in the synagogue stared at him
intently.
21 Then he said, "This Scripture has
come true today before your very eyes!"
22 All who were there spoke well of him
and were amazed by the gracious words
that fell from his lips. "How can this be?"
they asked. "Isn’t this Joseph’s son?"
23 Then he said, "Probably you will
quote me that proverb, ‘Physician, heal
yourself’––meaning, ‘Why don’t you do
miracles here in your hometown like
those you did in Capernaum?’LUKE 4
32
24 But the truth is, no prophet is
accepted in his own hometown.
25 "Certainly there were many widows
in Israel who needed help in Elijah’s
me, when there was no rain for three
and a half years and hunger stalked the
land.
26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of
them. He was sent instead to a widow
of Zarephath––a foreigner in the land of
Sidon.
27 Or think of the prophet Elisha, who
healed Naaman, a Syrian, rather than
the many lepers in Israel who needed
help."
28 When they heard this, the people in
the synagogue were furious.
29 Jumping up, they mobbed him and
took him to the edge of the hill on which
the city was built. They intended to push
him over the cliﬀ,LUKE 4
33
30 but he slipped away through the
crowd and le them.
31 Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a
town in Galilee, and taught there in the
synagogue every Sabbath day.
32 There, too, the people were amazed
at the things he said, because he spoke
with authority.
33 Once when he was in the synagogue,
a man possessed by a demon began
shou ng at Jesus,
34 "Go away! Why are you bothering
us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come
to destroy us? I know who you are––the
Holy One sent from God."
35 Jesus cut him short. "Be silent!" he
told the demon. "Come out of the man!"
The demon threw the man to the ﬂoor
as the crowd watched; then it le him
without hur ng him further.
36 Amazed, the people exclaimed,
"What authority and power this man’sLUKE 4
34
words possess! Even evil spirits obey him
and ﬂee at his command!"
37 The story of what he had done
spread like wildﬁre throughout the
whole region.
38 A er leaving the synagogue that day,
Jesus went to Simon’s home, where
he found Simon’s mother–in–law very
sick with a high fever. "Please heal her,"
everyone begged.
39 Standing at her bedside, he spoke to
the fever, rebuking it, and immediately
her temperature returned to normal.
She got up at once and prepared a meal
for them.
40 As the sun went down that evening,
people throughout the village brought
sick family members to Jesus. No ma er
what their diseases were, the touch of
his hand healed every one.
41 Some were possessed by demons;
and the demons came out at hisLUKE 4 – 5
35
command, shou ng, "You are the Son
of God." But because they knew he was
the Messiah, he stopped them and told
them to be silent.
42 Early the next morning Jesus went
out into the wilderness. The crowds
searched everywhere for him, and when
they ﬁnally found him, they begged him
not to leave them.
43 But he replied, "I must preach the
Good News of the Kingdom of God in
other places, too, because that is why I
was sent."
44 So he con nued to travel around,
preaching in synagogues throughout
Judea.
1 One day as Jesus was preaching on
the shore of the Sea of Galilee, great
crowds pressed in on him to listen to the
word of God.
5LUKE 5
2 He no
36
ced two empty boats at the
water’s edge, for the ﬁshermen had le
them and were washing their nets.
3 Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus
asked Simon, its owner, to push it out
into the water. So he sat in the boat and
taught the crowds from there.
4 When he had ﬁnished speaking, he
said to Simon, "Now go out where it is
deeper and let down your nets, and you
will catch many ﬁsh."
5 "Master," Simon replied, "we worked
hard all last night and didn’t catch a
thing. But if you say so, we’ll try again."
6 And this me their nets were so full
they began to tear!
7 A shout for help brought their partners
in the other boat, and soon both boats
were ﬁlled with ﬁsh and on the verge of
sinking.
8 When Simon Peter realized what had
happened, he fell to his knees beforeLUKE 5
37
Jesus and said, "Oh, Lord, please leave
me––I’m too much of a sinner to be
around you."
9 For he was awestruck by the size of
their catch, as were the others with him.
10 His partners, James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, were also amazed.
Jesus replied to Simon, "Don’t be
afraid! From now on you’ll be ﬁshing for
people!"
11 And as soon as they landed, they le
everything and followed Jesus.
12 In one of the villages, Jesus met a
man with an advanced case of leprosy.
When the man saw Jesus, he fell to the
ground, face down in the dust, begging
to be healed. "Lord," he said, "if you
want to, you can make me well again."
13 Jesus reached out and touched the
man. "I want to," he said. "Be healed!"
And instantly the leprosy disappeared.LUKE 5
38
14 Then Jesus instructed him not to
tell anyone what had happened. He
said, "Go right to the priest and let him
examine you. Take along the oﬀering
required in the law of Moses for those
who have been healed of leprosy,
so everyone will have proof of your
healing."
15 Yet despite Jesus’ instruc ons,
the report of his power spread even
faster, and vast crowds came to hear
him preach and to be healed of their
diseases.
16 But Jesus o en withdrew to the
wilderness for prayer.
17 One day while Jesus was teaching,
some Pharisees and teachers of religious
law were si ng nearby. (It seemed
that these men showed up from every
village in all Galilee and Judea, as well as
from Jerusalem.) And the Lord’s healing
power was strongly with Jesus.LUKE 5
39
18 Some men came carrying a paralyzed
man on a sleeping mat. They tried to
push through the crowd to Jesus,
19 but they couldn’t reach him. So they
went up to the roof, took oﬀ some les,
and lowered the sick man down into the
crowd, s ll on his mat, right in front of
Jesus.
20 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the
man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
21 "Who does this man think he is?" the
Pharisees and teachers of religious law
said to each other. "This is blasphemy!
Who but God can forgive sins?"
22 Jesus knew what they were thinking,
so he asked them, "Why do you think
this is blasphemy?
23 Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are
forgiven’ or ‘Get up and walk’?
24 I will prove that I, the Son of Man,
have the authority on earth to forgive
sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzedLUKE 5
40
man and said, "Stand up, take your
mat, and go on home, because you are
healed!"
25 And immediately, as everyone
watched, the man jumped to his feet,
picked up his mat, and went home
praising God.
26 Everyone was gripped with great
wonder and awe. And they praised God,
saying over and over again, "We have
seen amazing things today."
27 Later, as Jesus le the town, he saw
a tax collector named Levi si ng at his
tax–collec on booth. "Come, be my
disciple!" Jesus said to him.
28 So Levi got up, le everything, and
followed him.
29 Soon Levi held a banquet in his home
with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many
of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other
guests were there.LUKE 5
41
30 But the Pharisees and their teachers
of religious law complained bi erly to
Jesus’ disciples, "Why do you eat and
drink with such scum?"
31 Jesus answered them, "Healthy
people don’t need a doctor––sick people
do.
32 I have come to call sinners to turn
from their sins, not to spend my me
with those who think they are already
good enough."
33 The religious leaders complained that
Jesus’ disciples were feas ng instead
of fas ng. "John the Bap st’s disciples
always fast and pray," they declared,
"and so do the disciples of the Pharisees.
Why are yours always feas ng?"
34 Jesus asked, "Do wedding guests fast
while celebra ng with the groom?
35 Someday he will be taken away from
them, and then they will fast."LUKE 5 – 6
36 Then Jesus gave them this illustra
42
on:
"No one tears a piece of cloth from a
new garment and uses it to patch an
old garment. For then the new garment
would be torn, and the patch wouldn’t
even match the old garment.
37 And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins. The new wine would burst
the old skins, spilling the wine and
ruining the skins.
38 New wine must be put into new
wineskins.
39 But no one who drinks the old wine
seems to want the fresh and the new.
‘The old is be er,’ they say."
1 One Sabbath day as Jesus was
walking through some grainﬁelds,
his disciples broke oﬀ heads of wheat,
rubbed oﬀ the husks in their hands, and
ate the grains.
2 But some Pharisees said, "You
shouldn’t be doing that! It’s against the
6LUKE 6
43
law to work by harves ng grain on the
Sabbath."
3 Jesus replied, "Haven’t you ever read
in the Scriptures what King David did
when he and his companions were
hungry?
4 He went into the house of God, ate
the special bread reserved for the priests
alone, and then gave some to his friends.
That was breaking the law, too."
5 And Jesus added, "I, the Son of Man,
am master even of the Sabbath."
6 On another Sabbath day, a man
with a deformed right hand was in the
synagogue while Jesus was teaching.
7 The teachers of religious law and
the Pharisees watched closely to see
whether Jesus would heal the man on
the Sabbath, because they were eager to
ﬁnd some legal charge to bring against
him.LUKE 6
44
8 But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said
to the man with the deformed hand,
"Come and stand here where everyone
can see." So the man came forward.
9 Then Jesus said to his cri cs, "I have a
ques on for you. Is it legal to do good
deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for
doing harm? Is this a day to save life or
to destroy it?"
10 He looked around at them one by
one and then said to the man, "Reach
out your hand." The man reached out
his hand, and it became normal again!
11 At this, the enemies of Jesus were
wild with rage and began to discuss what
to do with him.
12 One day soon a erward Jesus went
to a mountain to pray, and he prayed to
God all night.
13 At daybreak he called together all of
his disciples and chose twelve of them
to be apostles. Here are their names:LUKE 6
45
14 Simon (he also called him Peter),
Andrew (Peter’s brother), James, John,
Philip, Bartholomew,
15 Ma hew, Thomas, James (son of
Alphaeus), Simon (the Zealot),
16 Judas (son of James), Judas Iscariot
(who later betrayed him).
17 When they came down the slopes of
the mountain, the disciples stood with
Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded
by many of his followers and by the
crowds. There were people from all over
Judea and from Jerusalem and from as
far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and
Sidon.
18 They had come to hear him and to
be healed, and Jesus cast out many evil
spirits.
19 Everyone was trying to touch him,
because healing power went out from
him, and they were all cured.LUKE 6
46
20 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and
said, "God blesses you who are poor, for
the Kingdom of God is given to you.
21 God blesses you who are hungry now,
for you will be sa sﬁed. God blesses you
who weep now, for the me will come
when you will laugh with joy.
22 God blesses you who are hated
and excluded and mocked and cursed
because you are iden ﬁed with me, the
Son of Man.
23 "When that happens, rejoice! Yes,
leap for joy! For a great reward awaits
you in heaven. And remember, the
ancient prophets were also treated that
way by your ancestors.
24 "What sorrows await you who are
rich, for you have your only happiness
now.
25 What sorrows await you who are
sa sﬁed and prosperous now, for a me
of awful hunger is before you. WhatLUKE 6
47
sorrows await you who laugh carelessly,
for your laughing will turn to mourning
and sorrow.
26 What sorrows await you who
are praised by the crowds, for their
ancestors also praised false prophets.
27 "But if you are willing to listen, I say,
love your enemies. Do good to those
who hate you.
28 Pray for the happiness of those who
curse you. Pray for those who hurt you.
29 If someone slaps you on one cheek,
turn the other cheek. If someone
demands your coat, oﬀer your shirt also.
30 Give what you have to anyone who
asks you for it; and when things are
taken away from you, don’t try to get
them back.
31 Do for others as you would like them
to do for you.LUKE 6
48
32 "Do you think you deserve credit
merely for loving those who love you?
Even the sinners do that!
33 And if you do good only to those who
do good to you, is that so wonderful?
Even sinners do that much!
34 And if you lend money only to those
who can repay you, what good is that?
Even sinners will lend to their own kind
for a full return.
35 "Love your enemies! Do good to
them! Lend to them! And don’t be
concerned that they might not repay.
Then your reward from heaven will be
very great, and you will truly be ac ng as
children of the Most High, for he is kind
to the unthankful and to those who are
wicked.
36 You must be compassionate, just as
your Father is compassionate.
37 "Stop judging others, and you will not
be judged. Stop cri cizing others, or itLUKE 6
49
will all come back on you. If you forgive
others, you will be forgiven.
38 If you give, you will receive. Your
gi will return to you in full measure,
pressed down, shaken together to
make room for more, and running
over. Whatever measure you use in
giving––large or small––it will be used to
measure what is given back to you."
39 Then Jesus gave the following
illustra on: "What good is it for one
blind person to lead another? The ﬁrst
one will fall into a ditch and pull the
other down also.
40 A student is not greater than the
teacher. But the student who works hard
will become like the teacher.
41 "And why worry about a speck in
your friend’s eye when you have a log in
your own?
42 How can you think of saying, ‘Friend,
let me help you get rid of that speck inLUKE 6
50
your eye,’ when you can’t see past the
log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get
rid of the log from your own eye; then
perhaps you will see well enough to deal
with the speck in your friend’s eye.
43 "A good tree can’t produce bad fruit,
and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit.
44 A tree is iden ﬁed by the kind of
fruit it produces. Figs never grow on
thornbushes or grapes on bramble
bushes.
45 A good person produces good deeds
from a good heart, and an evil person
produces evil deeds from an evil heart.
Whatever is in your heart determines
what you say.
46 "So why do you call me ‘Lord,’ when
you won’t obey me?
47 I will show you what it’s like when
someone comes to me, listens to my
teaching, and then obeys me.LUKE 6 – 7
51
48 It is like a person who builds a house
on a strong founda on laid upon the
underlying rock. When the ﬂoodwaters
rise and break against the house, it
stands ﬁrm because it is well built.
49 But anyone who listens and doesn’t
obey is like a person who builds a house
without a founda on. When the ﬂoods
sweep down against that house, it will
crumble into a heap of ruins."
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished saying all
this, he went back to Capernaum.
2 Now the highly valued slave of a
Roman oﬃcer was sick and near death.
3 When the oﬃcer heard about Jesus,
he sent some respected Jewish leaders
to ask him to come and heal his slave.
4 So they earnestly begged Jesus to
come with them and help the man. "If
anyone deserves your help, it is he,"
they said,
7LUKE 7
52
5 "for he loves the Jews and even built a
synagogue for us."
6 So Jesus went with them. But just
before they arrived at the house, the
oﬃcer sent some friends to say, "Lord,
don’t trouble yourself by coming to my
home, for I am not worthy of such an
honor.
7 I am not even worthy to come and
meet you. Just say the word from where
you are, and my servant will be healed.
8 I know because I am under the
authority of my superior oﬃcers, and I
have authority over my soldiers. I only
need to say, ‘Go,’ and they go, or ‘Come,’
and they come. And if I say to my slaves,
‘Do this or that,’ they do it."
9 When Jesus heard this, he was
amazed. Turning to the crowd, he said,
"I tell you, I haven’t seen faith like this in
all the land of Israel!"LUKE 7
53
10 And when the oﬃcer’s friends
returned to his house, they found the
slave completely healed.
11 Soon a erward Jesus went with his
disciples to the village of Nain, with a
great crowd following him.
12 A funeral procession was coming out
as he approached the village gate. The
boy who had died was the only son of
a widow, and many mourners from the
village were with her.
13 When the Lord saw her, his heart
overﬂowed with compassion. "Don’t
cry!" he said.
14 Then he walked over to the coﬃn
and touched it, and the bearers stopped.
"Young man," he said, "get up."
15 Then the dead boy sat up and began
to talk to those around him! And Jesus
gave him back to his mother.
16 Great fear swept the crowd, and they
praised God, saying, "A mighty prophetLUKE 7
54
has risen among us," and "We have seen
the hand of God at work today."
17 The report of what Jesus had done
that day spread all over Judea and even
out across its borders.
18 The disciples of John the Bap st told
John about everything Jesus was doing.
So John called for two of his disciples,
19 and he sent them to the Lord to ask
him, "Are you the Messiah we’ve been
expec ng, or should we keep looking for
someone else?"
20 John’s two disciples found Jesus and
said to him, "John the Bap st sent us to
ask, ‘Are you the Messiah we’ve been
expec ng, or should we keep looking for
someone else?’"
21 At that very me, he cured many
people of their various diseases, and he
cast out evil spirits and restored sight to
the blind.LUKE 7
55
22 Then he told John’s disciples, "Go
back to John and tell him what you have
seen and heard––the blind see, the lame
walk, the lepers are cured, the deaf hear,
the dead are raised to life, and the Good
News is being preached to the poor.
23 And tell him, ‘God blesses those who
are not oﬀended by me.’"
24 A er they le , Jesus talked to the
crowd about John. "Who is this man in
the wilderness that you went out to see?
Did you ﬁnd him weak as a reed, moved
by every breath of wind?
25 Or were you expec ng to see a
man dressed in expensive clothes? No,
people who wear beau ful clothes and
live in luxury are found in palaces, not in
the wilderness.
26 Were you looking for a prophet? Yes,
and he is more than a prophet.
27 John is the man to whom the
Scriptures refer when they say, ‘Look, ILUKE 7
56
am sending my messenger before you,
and he will prepare your way before
you.’
28 I tell you, of all who have ever lived,
none is greater than John. Yet even the
most insigniﬁcant person in the Kingdom
of God is greater than he is!"
29 When they heard this, all the people,
including the unjust tax collectors,
agreed that God’s plan was right, for
they had been bap zed by John.
30 But the Pharisees and experts in
religious law had rejected God’s plan
for them, for they had refused John’s
bap sm.
31 "How shall I describe this
genera on?" Jesus asked. "With
what will I compare them?
32 They are like a group of children
playing a game in the public square.
They complain to their friends, ‘We
played wedding songs, and you weren’tLUKE 7
57
happy, so we played funeral songs, but
you weren’t sad.’
33 For John the Bap st didn’t drink wine
and he o en fasted, and you say, ‘He’s
demon possessed.’
34 And I, the Son of Man, feast and
drink, and you say, ‘He’s a glu on and a
drunkard, and a friend of the worst sort
of sinners!’
35 But wisdom is shown to be right by
the lives of those who follow it."
36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to
come to his home for a meal, so Jesus
accepted the invita on and sat down to
eat.
37 A certain immoral woman heard he
was there and brought a beau ful jar
ﬁlled with expensive perfume.
38 Then she knelt behind him at his feet,
weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and
she wiped them oﬀ with her hair. ThenLUKE 7
58
she kept kissing his feet and pu ng
perfume on them.
39 When the Pharisee who was the host
saw what was happening and who the
woman was, he said to himself, "This
proves that Jesus is no prophet. If God
had really sent him, he would know what
kind of woman is touching him. She’s a
sinner!"
40 Then Jesus spoke up and answered
his thoughts. "Simon," he said to the
Pharisee, "I have something to say to
you." "All right, Teacher," Simon replied,
"go ahead."
41 Then Jesus told him this story: "A
man loaned money to two people––ﬁve
hundred pieces of silver to one and ﬁ y
pieces to the other.
42 But neither of them could repay
him, so he kindly forgave them both,
canceling their debts. Who do you
suppose loved him more a er that?"LUKE 7
59
43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one
for whom he canceled the larger debt."
"That’s right," Jesus said.
44 Then he turned to the woman and
said to Simon, "Look at this woman
kneeling here. When I entered your
home, you didn’t oﬀer me water to
wash the dust from my feet, but she has
washed them with her tears and wiped
them with her hair.
45 You didn’t give me a kiss of gree ng,
but she has kissed my feet again and
again from the me I ﬁrst came in.
46 You neglected the courtesy of olive
oil to anoint my head, but she has
anointed my feet with rare perfume.
47 I tell you, her sins––and they are
many––have been forgiven, so she has
shown me much love. But a person who
is forgiven li le shows only li le love."
48 Then Jesus said to the woman, "Your
sins are forgiven."LUKE 7 – 8
60
49 The men at the table said among
themselves, "Who does this man think
he is, going around forgiving sins?"
50 And Jesus said to the woman, "Your
faith has saved you; go in peace."
1 Not long a erward Jesus began a
tour of the nearby ci es and villages
to announce the Good News concerning
the Kingdom of God. He took his twelve
disciples with him,
2 along with some women he had
healed and from whom he had cast out
evil spirits. Among them were Mary
Magdalene, from whom he had cast out
seven demons;
3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s
business manager; Susanna; and many
others who were contribu ng from their
own resources to support Jesus and his
disciples.
8LUKE 8

4 One day Jesus told this story to a large
crowd that had gathered from many
towns to hear him:
5 "A farmer went out to plant some
seed. As he sca ered it across his ﬁeld,
some seed fell on a footpath, where it
was stepped on, and the birds came and
ate it.
6 Other seed fell on shallow soil with
underlying rock. This seed began to
grow, but soon it withered and died for
lack of moisture.
7 Other seed fell among thorns that
shot up and choked out the tender
blades.
8 S ll other seed fell on fer le soil. This
seed grew and produced a crop one
hundred mes as much as had been
planted." When he had said this, he
called out, "Anyone who is willing to
hear should listen and understand!"LUKE 8
62
9 His disciples asked him what the story
meant.
10 He replied, "You have been permi ed
to understand the secrets of the
Kingdom of God. But I am using these
stories to conceal everything about it
from outsiders, so that the Scriptures
might be fulﬁlled: ‘They see what I do,
but they don’t really see; they hear what
I say, but they don’t understand.’
11 "This is the meaning of the story: The
seed is God’s message.
12 The seed that fell on the hard path
represents those who hear the message,
but then the Devil comes and steals it
away and prevents them from believing
and being saved.
13 The rocky soil represents those who
hear the message with joy. But like
young plants in such soil, their roots
don’t go very deep. They believe for aLUKE 8
63
while, but they wilt when the hot winds
of tes ng blow.
14 The thorny ground represents those
who hear and accept the message, but
all too quickly the message is crowded
out by the cares and riches and pleasures
of this life. And so they never grow into
maturity.
15 But the good soil represents honest,
good–hearted people who hear God’s
message, cling to it, and steadily produce
a huge harvest.
16 "No one would light a lamp and then
cover it up or put it under a bed. No,
lamps are mounted in the open, where
they can be seen by those entering the
house.
17 For everything that is hidden or
secret will eventually be brought to light
and made plain to all.
18 So be sure to pay a en on to what
you hear. To those who are open to myLUKE 8
64
teaching, more understanding will be
given. But to those who are not listening,
even what they think they have will be
taken away from them."
19 Once when Jesus’ mother and
brothers came to see him, they couldn’t
get to him because of the crowds.
20 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother
and your brothers are outside, and they
want to see you."
21 Jesus replied, "My mother and my
brothers are all those who hear the
message of God and obey it."
22 One day Jesus said to his disciples,
"Let’s cross over to the other side of the
lake." So they got into a boat and started
out.
23 On the way across, Jesus lay down
for a nap, and while he was sleeping
the wind began to rise. A ﬁerce storm
developed that threatened to swamp
them, and they were in real danger.LUKE 8
24 The disciples woke him up, shou
65
ng,
"Master, Master, we’re going to drown!"
So Jesus rebuked the wind and the
raging waves. The storm stopped and all
was calm!
25 Then he asked them, "Where is
your faith?" And they were ﬁlled with
awe and amazement. They said to one
another, "Who is this man, that even the
winds and waves obey him?"
26 So they arrived in the land of the
Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee.
27 As Jesus was climbing out of the boat,
a man who was possessed by demons
came out to meet him. Homeless and
naked, he had lived in a cemetery for a
long me.
28 As soon as he saw Jesus, he shrieked
and fell to the ground before him,
screaming, "Why are you bothering me,
Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please,
I beg you, don’t torture me!"LUKE 8
66
29 For Jesus had already commanded
the evil spirit to come out of him. This
spirit had o en taken control of the man.
Even when he was shackled with chains,
he simply broke them and rushed out
into the wilderness, completely under
the demon’s power.
30 "What is your name?" Jesus asked.
"Legion," he replied––for the man was
ﬁlled with many demons.
31 The demons kept begging Jesus not
to send them into the Bo omless Pit.
32 A large herd of pigs was feeding on
the hillside nearby, and the demons
pleaded with him to let them enter into
the pigs. Jesus gave them permission.
33 So the demons came out of the man
and entered the pigs, and the whole
herd plunged down the steep hillside
into the lake, where they drowned.
34 When the herdsmen saw it, they ﬂed
to the nearby city and the surroundingLUKE 8
67
countryside, spreading the news as they
ran.
35 A crowd soon gathered around Jesus,
for they wanted to see for themselves
what had happened. And they saw
the man who had been possessed by
demons si ng quietly at Jesus’ feet,
clothed and sane. And the whole crowd
was afraid.
36 Then those who had seen what
happened told the others how the
demon–possessed man had been
healed.
37 And all the people in that region
begged Jesus to go away and leave them
alone, for a great wave of fear swept
over them. So Jesus returned to the boat
and le , crossing back to the other side
of the lake.
38 The man who had been demon
possessed begged to go, too, but Jesus
said,LUKE 8
68
39 "No, go back to your family and tell
them all the wonderful things God has
done for you." So he went all through
the city telling about the great thing
Jesus had done for him.
40 On the other side of the lake the
crowds received Jesus with open arms
because they had been wai ng for him.
41 And now a man named Jairus, a
leader of the local synagogue, came and
fell down at Jesus’ feet, begging him to
come home with him.
42 His only child was dying, a li le girl
twelve years old. As Jesus went with
him, he was surrounded by the crowds.
43 And there was a woman in the crowd
who had had a hemorrhage for twelve
years. She had spent everything she had
on doctors and s ll could ﬁnd no cure.
44 She came up behind Jesus and
touched the fringe of his robe.
Immediately, the bleeding stopped.LUKE 8
69
45 "Who touched me?" Jesus asked.
Everyone denied it, and Peter said,
"Master, this whole crowd is pressing up
against you."
46 But Jesus told him, "No, someone
deliberately touched me, for I felt
healing power go out from me."
47 When the woman realized that Jesus
knew, she began to tremble and fell to
her knees before him. The whole crowd
heard her explain why she had touched
him and that she had been immediately
healed.
48 "Daughter," he said to her, "your faith
has made you well. Go in peace."
49 While he was s ll speaking to her, a
messenger arrived from Jairus’s home
with the message, "Your li le girl is dead.
There’s no use troubling the Teacher
now."
50 But when Jesus heard what had
happened, he said to Jairus, "Don’t beLUKE 8
70
afraid. Just trust me, and she will be all
right."
51 When they arrived at the house,
Jesus wouldn’t let anyone go in with him
except Peter, James, John, and the li le
girl’s father and mother.
52 The house was ﬁlled with people
weeping and wailing, but he said, "Stop
the weeping! She isn’t dead; she is only
asleep."
53 But the crowd laughed at him
because they all knew she had died.
54 Then Jesus took her by the hand and
said in a loud voice, "Get up, my child!"
55 And at that moment her life returned,
and she immediately stood up! Then
Jesus told them to give her something to
eat.
56 Her parents were overwhelmed, but
Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone
what had happened.LUKE 9

71
1 One day Jesus called together
his twelve apostles and gave them
power and authority to cast out demons
and to heal all diseases.
2 Then he sent them out to tell everyone
about the coming of the Kingdom of God
and to heal the sick.
3 "Don’t even take along a walking
s ck," he instructed them, "nor a
traveler’s bag, nor food, nor money. Not
even an extra coat.
4 When you enter each village, be a
guest in only one home.
5 If the people of the village won’t
receive your message when you enter
it, shake oﬀ its dust from your feet as
you leave. It is a sign that you have
abandoned that village to its fate."
6 So they began their circuit of the
villages, preaching the Good News and
healing the sick.LUKE 9
72
7 When reports of Jesus’ miracles
reached Herod An pas, he was worried
and puzzled because some were saying,
"This is John the Bap st come back to
life again."
8 Others were saying, "It is Elijah or
some other ancient prophet risen from
the dead."
9 "I beheaded John," Herod said, "so
who is this man about whom I hear such
strange stories?" And he tried to see
him.
10 When the apostles returned, they
told Jesus everything they had done.
Then he slipped quietly away with them
toward the town of Bethsaida.
11 But the crowds found out where
he was going, and they followed him.
And he welcomed them, teaching them
about the Kingdom of God and curing
those who were ill.LUKE 9
12 Late in the a
73
ernoon the twelve
disciples came to him and said, "Send
the crowds away to the nearby villages
and farms, so they can ﬁnd food and
lodging for the night. There is nothing to
eat here in this deserted place."
13 But Jesus said, "You feed them."
"Impossible!" they protested. "We have
only ﬁve loaves of bread and two ﬁsh.
Or are you expec ng us to go and buy
enough food for this whole crowd?"
14 For there were about ﬁve thousand
men there. "Just tell them to sit down
on the ground in groups of about ﬁ y
each," Jesus replied.
15 So the people all sat down.
16 Jesus took the ﬁve loaves and two
ﬁsh, looked up toward heaven, and
asked God’s blessing on the food.
Breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept
giving the bread and ﬁsh to the disciples
to give to the people.LUKE 9
74
17 They all ate as much as they wanted,
and they picked up twelve baskets of
le overs!
18 One day as Jesus was alone, praying,
he came over to his disciples and asked
them, "Who do people say I am?"
19 "Well," they replied, "some say John
the Bap st, some say Elijah, and others
say you are one of the other ancient
prophets risen from the dead."
20 Then he asked them, "Who do you
say I am?" Peter replied, "You are the
Messiah sent from God!"
21 Jesus warned them not to tell anyone
about this.
22 "For I, the Son of Man, must suﬀer
many terrible things," he said. "I will
be rejected by the leaders, the leading
priests, and the teachers of religious law.
I will be killed, but three days later I will
be raised from the dead."LUKE 9
75
23 Then he said to the crowd, "If any of
you wants to be my follower, you must
put aside your selﬁsh ambi on, shoulder
your cross daily, and follow me.
24 If you try to keep your life for yourself,
you will lose it. But if you give up your
life for me, you will ﬁnd true life.
25 And how do you beneﬁt if you gain
the whole world but lose or forfeit your
own soul in the process?
26 If a person is ashamed of me and
my message, I, the Son of Man, will be
ashamed of that person when I return in
my glory and in the glory of the Father
and the holy angels.
27 And I assure you that some of you
standing here right now will not die
before you see the Kingdom of God."
28 About eight days later Jesus took
Peter, James, and John to a mountain to
pray.LUKE 9
76
29 And as he was praying, the
appearance of his face changed, and his
clothing became dazzling white.
30 Then two men, Moses and Elijah,
appeared and began talking with Jesus.
31 They were glorious to see. And they
were speaking of how he was about to
fulﬁll God’s plan by dying in Jerusalem.
32 Peter and the others were very
drowsy and had fallen asleep. Now they
woke up and saw Jesus’ glory and the
two men standing with him.
33 As Moses and Elijah were star ng to
leave, Peter, not even knowing what he
was saying, blurted out, "Master, this is
wonderful! We will make three shrines
––one for you, one for Moses, and one
for Elijah."
34 But even as he was saying this,
a cloud came over them; and terror
gripped them as it covered them.LUKE 9
77
35 Then a voice from the cloud said,
"This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen
to him."
36 When the voice died away, Jesus
was there alone. They didn’t tell anyone
what they had seen un l long a er this
happened.
37 The next day, a er they had come
down the mountain, a huge crowd met
Jesus.
38 A man in the crowd called out to him,
"Teacher, look at my boy, who is my only
son.
39 An evil spirit keeps seizing him,
making him scream. It throws him into
convulsions so that he foams at the
mouth. It is always hi ng and injuring
him. It hardly ever leaves him alone.
40 I begged your disciples to cast the
spirit out, but they couldn’t do it."LUKE 9
78
41 "You stubborn, faithless people,"
Jesus said, "how long must I be with you
and put up with you? Bring him here."
42 As the boy came forward, the demon
knocked him to the ground and threw
him into a violent convulsion. But Jesus
rebuked the evil spirit and healed the
boy. Then he gave him back to his father.
43 Awe gripped the people as they
saw this display of God’s power. While
everyone was marveling over all the
wonderful things he was doing, Jesus
said to his disciples,
44 "Listen to me and remember what
I say. The Son of Man is going to be
betrayed."
45 But they didn’t know what he meant.
Its signiﬁcance was hidden from them,
so they could not understand it, and
they were afraid to ask him about it.LUKE 9
79
46 Then there was an argument among
them as to which of them would be the
greatest.
47 But Jesus knew their thoughts, so he
brought a li le child to his side.
48 Then he said to them, "Anyone who
welcomes a li le child like this on my
behalf welcomes me, and anyone who
welcomes me welcomes my Father who
sent me. Whoever is the least among
you is the greatest."
49 John said to Jesus, "Master, we saw
someone using your name to cast out
demons. We tried to stop him because
he isn’t in our group."
50 But Jesus said, "Don’t stop him!
Anyone who is not against you is for
you."
51 As the me drew near for his return
to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for
Jerusalem.LUKE 9
80
52 He sent messengers ahead to a
Samaritan village to prepare for his
arrival.
53 But they were turned away. The
people of the village refused to have
anything to do with Jesus because he
had resolved to go to Jerusalem.
54 When James and John heard about
it, they said to Jesus, "Lord, should we
order down ﬁre from heaven to burn
them up?"
55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
56 So they went on to another village.
57 As they were walking along someone
said to Jesus, "I will follow you no ma er
where you go."
58 But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens
to live in, and birds have nests, but I, the
Son of Man, have no home of my own,
not even a place to lay my head."
59 He said to another person, "Come,
be my disciple." The man agreed, but heLUKE 9 – 10
81
said, "Lord, ﬁrst let me return home and
bury my father."
60 Jesus replied, "Let those who are
spiritually dead care for their own dead.
Your duty is to go and preach the coming
of the Kingdom of God."
61 Another said, "Yes, Lord, I will follow
you, but ﬁrst let me say good–bye to my
family."
62 But Jesus told him, "Anyone who
puts a hand to the plow and then looks
back is not ﬁt for the Kingdom of God."
1 The Lord now chose seventy–
two other disciples and sent them
on ahead in pairs to all the towns and
villages he planned to visit.
2 These were his instruc ons to them:
"The harvest is so great, but the workers
are so few. Pray to the Lord who is in
charge of the harvest, and ask him to
send out more workers for his ﬁelds.
10LUKE 10
82
3 Go now, and remember that I am
sending you out as lambs among wolves.
4 Don’t take along any money, or a
traveler’s bag, or even an extra pair of
sandals. And don’t stop to greet anyone
on the road.
5 "Whenever you enter a home, give it
your blessing.
6 If those who live there are worthy, the
blessing will stand; if they are not, the
blessing will return to you.
7 When you enter a town, don’t move
around from home to home. Stay in one
place, ea ng and drinking what they
provide you. Don’t hesitate to accept
hospitality, because those who work
deserve their pay.
8 "If a town welcomes you, eat whatever
is set before you
9 and heal the sick. As you heal them,
say, ‘The Kingdom of God is near you
now.’LUKE 10
83
10 But if a town refuses to welcome
you, go out into its streets and say,
11 ‘We wipe the dust of your town
from our feet as a public announcement
of your doom. And don’t forget the
Kingdom of God is near!’
12 The truth is, even wicked Sodom will
be be er oﬀ than such a town on the
judgment day.
13 "What horrors await you, Korazin
and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did
in you had been done in wicked Tyre
and Sidon, their people would have sat
in deep repentance long ago, clothed in
sackcloth and throwing ashes on their
heads to show their remorse.
14 Yes, Tyre and Sidon will be be er oﬀ
on the judgment day than you.
15 And you people of Capernaum, will
you be exalted to heaven? No, you will
be brought down to the place of the
dead."LUKE 10
84
16 Then he said to the disciples,
"Anyone who accepts your message is
also accep ng me. And anyone who
rejects you is rejec ng me. And anyone
who rejects me is rejec ng God who
sent me."
17 When the seventy–two disciples
returned, they joyfully reported to him,
"Lord, even the demons obey us when
we use your name!"
18 "Yes," he told them, "I saw Satan
falling from heaven as a ﬂash of
lightning!
19 And I have given you authority over
all the power of the enemy, and you can
walk among snakes and scorpions and
crush them. Nothing will injure you.
20 But don’t rejoice just because evil
spirits obey you; rejoice because your
names are registered as ci zens of
heaven."LUKE 10
85
21 Then Jesus was ﬁlled with the joy
of the Holy Spirit and said, "O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for
hiding the truth from those who think
themselves so wise and clever, and for
revealing it to the childlike. Yes, Father, it
pleased you to do it this way.
22 "My Father has given me authority
over everything. No one really knows
the Son except the Father, and no one
really knows the Father except the Son
and those to whom the Son chooses to
reveal him."
23 Then when they were alone, he
turned to the disciples and said, "How
privileged you are to see what you have
seen.
24 I tell you, many prophets and kings
have longed to see and hear what you
have seen and heard, but they could
not."LUKE 10
86
25 One day an expert in religious law
stood up to test Jesus by asking him this
ques on: "Teacher, what must I do to
receive eternal life?"
26 Jesus replied, "What does the law of
Moses say? How do you read it?"
27 The man answered, "‘You must love
the Lord your God with all your heart,
all your soul, all your strength, and all
your mind.’ And, ‘Love your neighbor as
yourself.’"
28 "Right!" Jesus told him. "Do this and
you will live!"
29 The man wanted to jus fy his
ac ons, so he asked Jesus, "And who is
my neighbor?"
30 Jesus replied with an illustra on:
"A Jewish man was traveling on a trip
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he was
a acked by bandits. They stripped him
of his clothes and money, beat him up,
and le him half dead beside the road.LUKE 10
87
31 "By chance a Jewish priest came
along; but when he saw the man lying
there, he crossed to the other side of
the road and passed him by.
32 A Temple assistant walked over and
looked at him lying there, but he also
passed by on the other side.
33 "Then a despised Samaritan came
along, and when he saw the man, he felt
deep pity.
34 Kneeling beside him, the Samaritan
soothed his wounds with medicine and
bandaged them. Then he put the man
on his own donkey and took him to an
inn, where he took care of him.
35 The next day he handed the
innkeeper two pieces of silver and told
him to take care of the man. ‘If his bill
runs higher than that,’ he said, ‘I’ll pay
the diﬀerence the next me I am here.’LUKE 10
88
36 "Now which of these three would
you say was a neighbor to the man who
was a acked by bandits?" Jesus asked.
37 The man replied, "The one who
showed him mercy." Then Jesus said,
"Yes, now go and do the same."
38 As Jesus and the disciples con nued
on their way to Jerusalem, they came to
a village where a woman named Martha
welcomed them into her home.
39 Her sister, Mary, sat at the Lord’s
feet, listening to what he taught.
40 But Martha was worrying over the
big dinner she was preparing. She came
to Jesus and said, "Lord, doesn’t it seem
unfair to you that my sister just sits here
while I do all the work? Tell her to come
and help me."
41 But the Lord said to her, "My dear
Martha, you are so upset over all these
details!LUKE 10 – 11
89
42 There is really only one thing worth
being concerned about. Mary has
discovered it––and I won’t take it away
from her."
1 Once when Jesus had been out
praying, one of his disciples came
to him as he ﬁnished and said, "Lord,
teach us to pray, just as John taught his
disciples."
2 He said, "This is how you should pray:
"Father, may your name be honored.
May your Kingdom come soon.
3 Give us our food day by day.
4 And forgive us our sins––just as we
forgive those who have sinned against
us. And don’t let us yield to tempta on."
5 Then, teaching them more about
prayer, he used this illustra on:
"Suppose you went to a friend’s house
at midnight, wan ng to borrow three
loaves of bread. You would say to him,
11LUKE 11
90
6 ‘A friend of mine has just arrived for a
visit, and I have nothing for him to eat.’
7 He would call out from his bedroom,
‘Don’t bother me. The door is locked for
the night, and we are all in bed. I can’t
help you this me.’
8 But I tell you this––though he won’t
do it as a friend, if you keep knocking
long enough, he will get up and give you
what you want so his reputa on won’t
be damaged.
9 "And so I tell you, keep on asking, and
you will be given what you ask for. Keep
on looking, and you will ﬁnd. Keep on
knocking, and the door will be opened.
10 For everyone who asks, receives.
Everyone who seeks, ﬁnds. And the door
is opened to everyone who knocks.
11 "You fathers––if your children ask for
a ﬁsh, do you give them a snake instead?
12 Or if they ask for an egg, do you give
them a scorpion? Of course not!LUKE 11
91
13 If you sinful people know how to give
good gi s to your children, how much
more will your heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to those who ask him."
14 One day Jesus cast a demon out of a
man who couldn’t speak, and the man’s
voice returned to him. The crowd was
amazed,
15 but some said, "No wonder he can
cast out demons. He gets his power from
Satan, the prince of demons!"
16 Trying to test Jesus, others asked for
a miraculous sign from heaven to see if
he was from God.
17 He knew their thoughts, so he
said, "Any kingdom at war with itself
is doomed. A divided home is also
doomed.
18 You say I am empowered by the
prince of demons. But if Satan is ﬁgh ng
against himself by empowering meLUKE 11
92
to cast out his demons, how can his
kingdom survive?
19 And if I am empowered by the
prince of demons, what about your own
followers? They cast out demons, too,
so they will judge you for what you have
said.
20 But if I am cas ng out demons by the
power of God, then the Kingdom of God
has arrived among you.
21 For when Satan, who is completely
armed, guards his palace, it is safe––
22 un l someone who is stronger
a acks and overpowers him, strips
him of his weapons, and carries oﬀ his
belongings.
23 "Anyone who isn’t helping me
opposes me, and anyone who isn’t
working with me is actually working
against me.
24 "When an evil spirit leaves a person,
it goes into the desert, searching forLUKE 11
93
rest. But when it ﬁnds none, it says, ‘I
will return to the person I came from.’
25 So it returns and ﬁnds that its former
home is all swept and clean.
26 Then the spirit ﬁnds seven other
spirits more evil than itself, and they all
enter the person and live there. And so
that person is worse oﬀ than before."
27 As he was speaking, a woman in
the crowd called out, "God bless your
mother––the womb from which you
came, and the breasts that nursed you!"
28 He replied, "But even more blessed
are all who hear the word of God and
put it into prac ce."
29 As the crowd pressed in on Jesus,
he said, "These are evil mes, and this
evil genera on keeps asking me to show
them a miraculous sign. But the only sign
I will give them is the sign of the prophet
Jonah.LUKE 11
94
30 What happened to him was a sign to
the people of Nineveh that God had sent
him. What happens to me will be a sign
that God has sent me, the Son of Man,
to these people.
31 "The queen of Sheba will rise up
against this genera on on judgment
day and condemn it, because she came
from a distant land to hear the wisdom
of Solomon. And now someone greater
than Solomon is here––and you refuse
to listen to him.
32 The people of Nineveh, too, will rise
up against this genera on on judgment
day and condemn it, because they
repented at the preaching of Jonah.
And now someone greater than Jonah is
here––and you refuse to repent.
33 "No one lights a lamp and then hides
it or puts it under a basket. Instead, it is
put on a lampstand to give light to all
who enter the room.LUKE 11
95
34 Your eye is a lamp for your body. A
pure eye lets sunshine into your soul.
But an evil eye shuts out the light and
plunges you into darkness.
35 Make sure that the light you think
you have is not really darkness.
36 If you are ﬁlled with light, with no
dark corners, then your whole life will be
radiant, as though a ﬂoodlight is shining
on you."
37 As Jesus was speaking, one of the
Pharisees invited him home for a meal.
So he went in and took his place at the
table.
38 His host was amazed to see that he
sat down to eat without ﬁrst performing
the ceremonial washing required by
Jewish custom.
39 Then the Lord said to him, "You
Pharisees are so careful to clean the
outside of the cup and the dish, butLUKE 11
96
inside you are s ll ﬁlthy––full of greed
and wickedness!
40 Fools! Didn’t God make the inside as
well as the outside?
41 So give to the needy what you
greedily possess, and you will be clean
all over.
42 "But how terrible it will be for you
Pharisees! For you are careful to the
even the niest part of your income, but
you completely forget about jus ce and
the love of God. You should the, yes,
but you should not leave undone the
more important things.
43 "How terrible it will be for you
Pharisees! For how you love the seats
of honor in the synagogues and the
respec ul gree ngs from everyone as
you walk through the markets!
44 Yes, how terrible it will be for you.
For you are like hidden graves in a ﬁeld.LUKE 11
97
People walk over them without knowing
the corrup on they are stepping on."
45 "Teacher," said an expert in religious
law, "you have insulted us, too, in what
you just said."
46 "Yes," said Jesus, "how terrible it will
be for you experts in religious law! For
you crush people beneath impossible
religious demands, and you never li a
ﬁnger to help ease the burden.
47 How terrible it will be for you! For
you build tombs for the very prophets
your ancestors killed long ago.
48 Murderers! You agree with your
ancestors that what they did was
right. You would have done the same
yourselves.
49 This is what God in his wisdom said
about you: ‘I will send prophets and
apostles to them, and they will kill some
and persecute the others.’LUKE 11 – 12
50 "And you of this genera
98
on will be
held responsible for the murder of all
God’s prophets from the crea on of the
world––
51 from the murder of Abel to the
murder of Zechariah, who was killed
between the altar and the sanctuary.
Yes, it will surely be charged against you.
52 "How terrible it will be for you
experts in religious law! For you hide the
key to knowledge from the people. You
don’t enter the Kingdom yourselves, and
you prevent others from entering."
53 As Jesus ﬁnished speaking, the
Pharisees and teachers of religious law
were furious. From that me on they
grilled him with many hos le ques ons,
54 trying to trap him into saying
something they could use against him.
1 Meanwhile, the crowds grew
un l thousands were milling
about and crushing each other. Jesus
12LUKE 12
99
turned ﬁrst to his disciples and warned
them, "Beware of the yeast of the
Pharisees––beware of their hypocrisy.
2 The me is coming when everything
will be revealed; all that is secret will be
made public.
3 Whatever you have said in the dark
will be heard in the light, and what you
have whispered behind closed doors will
be shouted from the housetops for all to
hear!
4 "Dear friends, don’t be afraid of those
who want to kill you. They can only kill
the body; they cannot do any more to
you.
5 But I’ll tell you whom to fear. Fear
God, who has the power to kill people
and then throw them into hell.
6 "What is the price of ﬁve sparrows?
A couple of pennies? Yet God does not
forget a single one of them.LUKE 12
100
7 And the very hairs on your head are
all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are
more valuable to him than a whole ﬂock
of sparrows.
8 "And I assure you of this: If anyone
acknowledges me publicly here on
earth, I, the Son of Man, will openly
acknowledge that person in the presence
of God’s angels.
9 But if anyone denies me here on
earth, I will deny that person before
God’s angels.
10 Yet those who speak against the Son
of Man may be forgiven, but anyone
who speaks blasphemies against the
Holy Spirit will never be forgiven.
11 "And when you are brought to trial
in the synagogues and before rulers and
authori es, don’t worry about what to
say in your defense,LUKE 12
101
12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you
what needs to be said even as you are
standing there."
13 Then someone called from the
crowd, "Teacher, please tell my brother
to divide our father’s estate with me."
14 Jesus replied, "Friend, who made me
a judge over you to decide such things as
that?"
15 Then he said, "Beware! Don’t be
greedy for what you don’t have. Real life
is not measured by how much we own."
16 And he gave an illustra on: "A rich
man had a fer le farm that produced
ﬁne crops.
17 In fact, his barns were full to
overﬂowing.
18 So he said, ‘I know! I’ll tear down my
barns and build bigger ones. Then I’ll
have room enough to store everything.
19 And I’ll sit back and say to myself, My
friend, you have enough stored away forLUKE 12
102
years to come. Now take it easy! Eat,
drink, and be merry!’
20 "But God said to him, ‘You fool! You
will die this very night. Then who will get
it all?’
21 "Yes, a person is a fool to store
up earthly wealth but not have a rich
rela onship with God."
22 Then turning to his disciples, Jesus
said, "So I tell you, don’t worry about
everyday life––whether you have
enough food to eat or clothes to wear.
23 For life consists of far more than food
and clothing.
24 Look at the ravens. They don’t need
to plant or harvest or put food in barns
because God feeds them. And you are
far more valuable to him than any birds!
25 Can all your worries add a single
moment to your life? Of course not!LUKE 12
26 And if worry can’t do li
103
le things like
that, what’s the use of worrying over
bigger things?
27 "Look at the lilies and how they grow.
They don’t work or make their clothing,
yet Solomon in all his glory was not
dressed as beau fully as they are.
28 And if God cares so wonderfully for
ﬂowers that are here today and gone
tomorrow, won’t he more surely care for
you? You have so li le faith!
29 And don’t worry about food––what
to eat and drink. Don’t worry whether
God will provide it for you.
30 These things dominate the thoughts
of most people, but your Father already
knows your needs.
31 He will give you all you need from
day to day if you make the Kingdom of
God your primary concern.LUKE 12
32 "So don’t be afraid, li
104
le ﬂock. For it
gives your Father great happiness to give
you the Kingdom.
33 "Sell what you have and give to those
in need. This will store up treasure for
you in heaven! And the purses of heaven
have no holes in them. Your treasure
will be safe––no thief can steal it and no
moth can destroy it.
34 Wherever your treasure is, there
your heart and thoughts will also be.
35 "Be dressed for service and well
prepared,
36 as though you were wai ng for your
master to return from the wedding feast.
Then you will be ready to open the door
and let him in the moment he arrives
and knocks.
37 There will be special favor for those
who are ready and wai ng for his return.
I tell you, he himself will seat them, putLUKE 12
105
on an apron, and serve them as they sit
and eat!
38 He may come in the middle of the
night or just before dawn. But whenever
he comes, there will be special favor for
his servants who are ready!
39 "Know this: A homeowner who knew
exactly when a burglar was coming
would not permit the house to be broken
into.
40 You must be ready all the me, for
the Son of Man will come when least
expected."
41 Peter asked, "Lord, is this illustra on
just for us or for everyone?"
42 And the Lord replied, "I’m talking to
any faithful, sensible servant to whom
the master gives the responsibility of
managing his household and feeding his
family.LUKE 12
106
43 If the master returns and ﬁnds that
the servant has done a good job, there
will be a reward.
44 I assure you, the master will put that
servant in charge of all he owns.
45 But if the servant thinks, ‘My master
won’t be back for a while,’ and begins
oppressing the other servants, partying,
and ge ng drunk––
46 well, the master will return
unannounced and unexpected. He will
tear the servant apart and banish him
with the unfaithful.
47 The servant will be severely
punished, for though he knew his duty,
he refused to do it.
48 "But people who are not aware that
they are doing wrong will be punished
only lightly. Much is required from those
to whom much is given, and much more
is required from those to whom much
more is given.LUKE 12
107
49 "I have come to bring ﬁre to the
earth, and I wish that my task were
already completed!
50 There is a terrible bap sm ahead of
me, and I am under a heavy burden un l
it is accomplished.
51 Do you think I have come to bring
peace to the earth? No, I have come to
bring strife and division!
52 From now on families will be split
apart, three in favor of me, and two
against––or the other way around.
53 There will be a division between
father and son, mother and daughter,
mother–in–law and daughter–in–law."
54 Then Jesus turned to the crowd and
said, "When you see clouds beginning to
form in the west, you say, ‘Here comes a
shower.’ And you are right.
55 When the south wind blows, you say,
‘Today will be a scorcher.’ And it is.LUKE 12 – 13
108
56 You hypocrites! You know how to
interpret the appearance of the earth
and the sky, but you can’t interpret these
present mes.
57 "Why can’t you decide for yourselves
what is right?
58 If you are on the way to court and
you meet your accuser, try to se le the
ma er before it reaches the judge, or
you may be sentenced and handed over
to an oﬃcer and thrown in jail.
59 And if that happens, you won’t be
free again un l you have paid the last
penny."
1 About this me Jesus was
informed that Pilate had
murdered some people from Galilee as
they were sacriﬁcing at the Temple in
Jerusalem.
2 "Do you think those Galileans were
worse sinners than other people from
13LUKE 13
109
Galilee?" he asked. "Is that why they
suﬀered?
3 Not at all! And you will also perish
unless you turn from your evil ways and
turn to God.
4 And what about the eighteen men
who died when the Tower of Siloam fell
on them? Were they the worst sinners in
Jerusalem?
5 No, and I tell you again that unless you
repent, you will also perish."
6 Then Jesus used this illustra on: "A
man planted a ﬁg tree in his garden and
came again and again to see if there
was any fruit on it, but he was always
disappointed.
7 Finally, he said to his gardener, ‘I’ve
waited three years, and there hasn’t
been a single ﬁg! Cut it down. It’s taking
up space we can use for something else.’
8 "The gardener answered, ‘Give it one
more chance. Leave it another year, andLUKE 13
110
I’ll give it special a en on and plenty of
fer lizer.
9 If we get ﬁgs next year, ﬁne. If not, you
can cut it down.’"
10 One Sabbath day as Jesus was
teaching in a synagogue,
11 he saw a woman who had been
crippled by an evil spirit. She had been
bent double for eighteen years and was
unable to stand up straight.
12 When Jesus saw her, he called her
over and said, "Woman, you are healed
of your sickness!"
13 Then he touched her, and instantly
she could stand straight. How she
praised and thanked God!
14 But the leader in charge of the
synagogue was indignant that Jesus had
healed her on the Sabbath day. "There
are six days of the week for working," he
said to the crowd. "Come on those days
to be healed, not on the Sabbath."LUKE 13
111
15 But the Lord replied, "You hypocrite!
You work on the Sabbath day! Don’t you
un e your ox or your donkey from their
stalls on the Sabbath and lead them out
for water?
16 Wasn’t it necessary for me, even on
the Sabbath day, to free this dear woman
from the bondage in which Satan has
held her for eighteen years?"
17 This shamed his enemies. And all the
people rejoiced at the wonderful things
he did.
18 Then Jesus said, "What is the
Kingdom of God like? How can I illustrate
it?
19 It is like a ny mustard seed planted
in a garden; it grows and becomes a
tree, and the birds come and ﬁnd shelter
among its branches."
20 He also asked, "What else is the
Kingdom of God like?LUKE 13
112
21 It is like yeast used by a woman
making bread. Even though she used
a large amount of ﬂour, the yeast
permeated every part of the dough."
22 Jesus went through the towns and
villages, teaching as he went, always
pressing on toward Jerusalem.
23 Someone asked him, "Lord, will only
a few be saved?" He replied,
24 "The door to heaven is narrow. Work
hard to get in, because many will try to
enter,
25 but when the head of the house has
locked the door, it will be too late. Then
you will stand outside knocking and
pleading, ‘Lord, open the door for us!’
But he will reply, ‘I do not know you.’
26 You will say, ‘But we ate and drank
with you, and you taught in our streets.’
27 And he will reply, ‘I tell you, I don’t
know you. Go away, all you who do evil.’LUKE 13
113
28 "And there will be great weeping
and gnashing of teeth, for you will
see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets within the Kingdom of God,
but you will be thrown out.
29 Then people will come from all over
the world to take their places in the
Kingdom of God.
30 And note this: Some who are
despised now will be greatly honored
then; and some who are greatly honored
now will be despised then."
31 A few minutes later some Pharisees
said to him, "Get out of here if you want
to live, because Herod An pas wants to
kill you!"
32 Jesus replied, "Go tell that fox that
I will keep on cas ng out demons and
doing miracles of healing today and
tomorrow; and the third day I will
accomplish my purpose.LUKE 13 – 14
114
33 Yes, today, tomorrow, and the next
day I must proceed on my way. For it
wouldn’t do for a prophet of God to be
killed except in Jerusalem!
34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city
that kills the prophets and stones God’s
messengers! How o en I have wanted to
gather your children together as a hen
protects her chicks beneath her wings,
but you wouldn’t let me.
35 And now look, your house is le to
you empty. And you will never see me
again un l you say, ‘Bless the one who
comes in the name of the Lord!’"
1 One Sabbath day Jesus was
in the home of a leader of the
Pharisees. The people were watching
him closely,
2 because there was a man there whose
arms and legs were swollen.
3 Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts
in religious law, "Well, is it permi ed in
14LUKE 14
115
the law to heal people on the Sabbath
day, or not?"
4 When they refused to answer, Jesus
touched the sick man and healed him
and sent him away.
5 Then he turned to them and asked,
"Which of you doesn’t work on the
Sabbath? If your son or your cow falls
into a pit, don’t you proceed at once to
get him out?"
6 Again they had no answer.
7 When Jesus no ced that all who had
come to the dinner were trying to sit
near the head of the table, he gave them
this advice:
8 "If you are invited to a wedding feast,
don’t always head for the best seat.
What if someone more respected than
you has also been invited?
9 The host will say, ‘Let this person
sit here instead.’ Then you will be
embarrassed and will have to takeLUKE 14
116
whatever seat is le at the foot of the
table!
10 "Do this instead––sit at the foot of
the table. Then when your host sees you,
he will come and say, ‘Friend, we have a
be er place than this for you!’ Then you
will be honored in front of all the other
guests.
11 For the proud will be humbled, but
the humble will be honored."
12 Then he turned to his host. "When
you put on a luncheon or a dinner," he
said, "don’t invite your friends, brothers,
rela ves, and rich neighbors. For they
will repay you by invi ng you back.
13 Instead, invite the poor, the crippled,
the lame, and the blind.
14 Then at the resurrec on of the godly,
God will reward you for invi ng those
who could not repay you."
15 Hearing this, a man si ng at the
table with Jesus exclaimed, "What aLUKE 14
117
privilege it would be to have a share in
the Kingdom of God!"
16 Jesus replied with this illustra on: "A
man prepared a great feast and sent out
many invita ons.
17 When all was ready, he sent his
servant around to no fy the guests that
it was me for them to come.
18 But they all began making excuses.
One said he had just bought a ﬁeld and
wanted to inspect it, so he asked to be
excused.
19 Another said he had just bought ﬁve
pair of oxen and wanted to try them out.
20 Another had just been married, so he
said he couldn’t come.
21 "The servant returned and told his
master what they had said. His master
was angry and said, ‘Go quickly into the
streets and alleys of the city and invite
the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the
blind.’LUKE 14
22 A
118
er the servant had done this, he
reported, ‘There is s ll room for more.’
23 So his master said, ‘Go out into the
country lanes and behind the hedges
and urge anyone you ﬁnd to come, so
that the house will be full.
24 For none of those I invited ﬁrst will
get even the smallest taste of what I had
prepared for them.’"
25 Great crowds were following Jesus.
He turned around and said to them,
26 "If you want to be my follower you
must love me more than your own
father and mother, wife and children,
brothers and sisters––yes, more than
your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be
my disciple.
27 And you cannot be my disciple if you
do not carry your own cross and follow
me.
28 "But don’t begin un l you count the
cost. For who would begin construc onLUKE 14
119
of a building without ﬁrst ge ng
es mates and then checking to see if
there is enough money to pay the bills?
29 Otherwise, you might complete only
the founda on before running out of
funds. And then how everyone would
laugh at you!
30 They would say, ‘There’s the person
who started that building and ran out of
money before it was ﬁnished!’
31 "Or what king would ever dream
of going to war without ﬁrst si ng
down with his counselors and discussing
whether his army of ten thousand is
strong enough to defeat the twenty
thousand soldiers who are marching
against him?
32 If he is not able, then while the
enemy is s ll far away, he will send a
delega on to discuss terms of peace.
33 So no one can become my disciple
without giving up everything for me.LUKE 14 – 15
120
34 "Salt is good for seasoning. But if it
loses its ﬂavor, how do you make it salty
again?
35 Flavorless salt is good neither for the
soil nor for fer lizer. It is thrown away.
Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen and understand!"
1 Tax collectors and other
notorious sinners o en came to
listen to Jesus teach.
2 This made the Pharisees and teachers
of religious law complain that he
was associa ng with such despicable
people––even ea ng with them!
3 So Jesus used this illustra on:
4 "If you had one hundred sheep, and
one of them strayed away and was lost
in the wilderness, wouldn’t you leave
the ninety–nine others to go and search
for the lost one un l you found it?
5 And then you would joyfully carry it
home on your shoulders.
15LUKE 15
121
6 When you arrived, you would call
together your friends and neighbors to
rejoice with you because your lost sheep
was found.
7 In the same way, heaven will be
happier over one lost sinner who returns
to God than over ninety–nine others
who are righteous and haven’t strayed
away!
8 "Or suppose a woman has ten
valuable silver coins and loses one.
Won’t she light a lamp and look in every
corner of the house and sweep every
nook and cranny un l she ﬁnds it?
9 And when she ﬁnds it, she will call in
her friends and neighbors to rejoice with
her because she has found her lost coin.
10 In the same way, there is joy in the
presence of God’s angels when even one
sinner repents."LUKE 15
122
11 To illustrate the point further, Jesus
told them this story: "A man had two
sons.
12 The younger son told his father,
‘I want my share of your estate now,
instead of wai ng un l you die.’ So
his father agreed to divide his wealth
between his sons.
13 "A few days later this younger son
packed all his belongings and took a trip
to a distant land, and there he wasted all
his money on wild living.
14 About the me his money ran out, a
great famine swept over the land, and
he began to starve.
15 He persuaded a local farmer to hire
him to feed his pigs.
16 The boy became so hungry that
even the pods he was feeding the pigs
looked good to him. But no one gave him
anything.LUKE 15
123
17 "When he ﬁnally came to his senses,
he said to himself, ‘At home even the
hired men have food enough to spare,
and here I am, dying of hunger!
18 I will go home to my father and
say, "Father, I have sinned against both
heaven and you,
19 and I am no longer worthy of being
called your son. Please take me on as a
hired man."’
20 "So he returned home to his father.
And while he was s ll a long distance
away, his father saw him coming. Filled
with love and compassion, he ran to his
son, embraced him, and kissed him.
21 His son said to him, ‘Father, I have
sinned against both heaven and you, and
I am no longer worthy of being called
your son.’
22 "But his father said to the servants,
‘Quick! Bring the ﬁnest robe in the houseLUKE 15
124
and put it on him. Get a ring for his
ﬁnger, and sandals for his feet.
23 And kill the calf we have been
fa ening in the pen. We must celebrate
with a feast,
24 for this son of mine was dead and
has now returned to life. He was lost,
but now he is found.’ So the party began.
25 "Meanwhile, the older son was in
the ﬁelds working. When he returned
home, he heard music and dancing in
the house,
26 and he asked one of the servants
what was going on.
27 ‘Your brother is back,’ he was told,
‘and your father has killed the calf we
were fa ening and has prepared a great
feast. We are celebra ng because of his
safe return.’
28 "The older brother was angry and
wouldn’t go in. His father came out and
begged him,LUKE 15 – 16
125
29 but he replied, ‘All these years I’ve
worked hard for you and never once
refused to do a single thing you told me
to. And in all that me you never gave
me even one young goat for a feast with
my friends.
30 Yet when this son of yours comes
back a er squandering your money on
pros tutes, you celebrate by killing the
ﬁnest calf we have.’
31 "His father said to him, ‘Look, dear
son, you and I are very close, and
everything I have is yours.
32 We had to celebrate this happy day.
For your brother was dead and has come
back to life! He was lost, but now he is
found!’"
1 Jesus told this story to his
disciples: "A rich man hired a
manager to handle his aﬀairs, but soon
a rumor went around that the manager
was thoroughly dishonest.
16LUKE 16
126
2 So his employer called him in and said,
‘What’s this I hear about your stealing
from me? Get your report in order,
because you are going to be dismissed.’
3 "The manager thought to himself,
‘Now what? I’m through here, and I
don’t have the strength to go out and dig
ditches, and I’m too proud to beg.
4 I know just the thing! And then I’ll
have plenty of friends to take care of me
when I leave!’
5 "So he invited each person who owed
money to his employer to come and
discuss the situa on. He asked the ﬁrst
one, ‘How much do you owe him?’
6 The man replied, ‘I owe him eight
hundred gallons of olive oil.’ So the
manager told him, ‘Tear up that bill and
write another one for four hundred
gallons.’
7 "‘And how much do you owe my
employer?’ he asked the next man. ‘ALUKE 16
127
thousand bushels of wheat,’ was the
reply. ‘Here,’ the manager said, ‘take
your bill and replace it with one for only
eight hundred bushels.’
8 "The rich man had to admire the
dishonest rascal for being so shrewd.
And it is true that the ci zens of this
world are more shrewd than the godly
are.
9 I tell you, use your worldly resources
to beneﬁt others and make friends. In
this way, your generosity stores up a
reward for you in heaven.
10 "Unless you are faithful in small
ma ers, you won’t be faithful in large
ones. If you cheat even a li le, you won’t
be honest with greater responsibili es.
11 And if you are untrustworthy about
worldly wealth, who will trust you with
the true riches of heaven?LUKE 16
128
12 And if you are not faithful with other
people’s money, why should you be
trusted with money of your own?
13 "No one can serve two masters. For
you will hate one and love the other, or
be devoted to one and despise the other.
You cannot serve both God and money."
14 The Pharisees, who dearly loved their
money, naturally scoﬀed at all this.
15 Then he said to them, "You like to
look good in public, but God knows your
evil hearts. What this world honors is an
abomina on in the sight of God.
16 "Un l John the Bap st began to
preach, the laws of Moses and the
messages of the prophets were your
guides. But now the Good News of the
Kingdom of God is preached, and eager
mul tudes are forcing their way in.
17 But that doesn’t mean that the law
has lost its force in even the smallestLUKE 16
129
point. It is stronger and more permanent
than heaven and earth.
18 "Anyone who divorces his wife and
marries someone else commits adultery,
and anyone who marries a divorced
woman commits adultery."
19 Jesus said, "There was a certain rich
man who was splendidly clothed and
who lived each day in luxury.
20 At his door lay a diseased beggar
named Lazarus.
21 As Lazarus lay there longing for
scraps from the rich man’s table, the
dogs would come and lick his open sores.
22 Finally, the beggar died and was
carried by the angels to be with
Abraham. The rich man also died and
was buried,
23 and his soul went to the place of the
dead. There, in torment, he saw Lazarus
in the far distance with Abraham.LUKE 16
130
24 "The rich man shouted, ‘Father
Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus
over here to dip the p of his ﬁnger in
water and cool my tongue, because I am
in anguish in these ﬂames.’
25 "But Abraham said to him, ‘Son,
remember that during your life me you
had everything you wanted, and Lazarus
had nothing. So now he is here being
comforted, and you are in anguish.
26 And besides, there is a great chasm
separa ng us. Anyone who wanted to
cross over to you from here is stopped
at its edge, and no one there can cross
over to us.’
27 "Then the rich man said, ‘Please,
Father Abraham, send him to my father’s
home.
28 For I have ﬁve brothers, and I want
him to warn them about this place of
torment so they won’t have to come
here when they die.’LUKE 16 – 17
131
29 "But Abraham said, ‘Moses and
the prophets have warned them. Your
brothers can read their wri ngs any me
they want to.’
30 "The rich man replied, ‘No, Father
Abraham! But if someone is sent to them
from the dead, then they will turn from
their sins.’
31 "But Abraham said, ‘If they won’t
listen to Moses and the prophets, they
won’t listen even if someone rises from
the dead.’"
1 One day Jesus said to his
disciples, "There will always be
tempta ons to sin, but how terrible it
will be for the person who does the
temp ng.
2 It would be be er to be thrown
into the sea with a large millstone
ed around the neck than to face the
punishment in store for harming one of
these li le ones.
17LUKE 17
132
3 I am warning you! If another believer
sins, rebuke him; then if he repents,
forgive him.
4 Even if he wrongs you seven mes a
day and each me turns again and asks
forgiveness, forgive him."
5 One day the apostles said to the Lord,
"We need more faith; tell us how to get
it."
6 "Even if you had faith as small as a
mustard seed," the Lord answered, "you
could say to this mulberry tree, ‘May
God uproot you and throw you into the
sea,’ and it would obey you!
7 "When a servant comes in from
plowing or taking care of sheep, he
doesn’t just sit down and eat.
8 He must ﬁrst prepare his master’s
meal and serve him his supper before
ea ng his own.LUKE 17
133
9 And the servant is not even thanked,
because he is merely doing what he is
supposed to do.
10 In the same way, when you obey me
you should say, ‘We are not worthy of
praise. We are servants who have simply
done our duty.’"
11 As Jesus con nued on toward
Jerusalem, he reached the border
between Galilee and Samaria.
12 As he entered a village there, ten
lepers stood at a distance,
13 crying out, "Jesus, Master, have
mercy on us!"
14 He looked at them and said, "Go
show yourselves to the priests." And as
they went, their leprosy disappeared.
15 One of them, when he saw that
he was healed, came back to Jesus,
shou ng, "Praise God, I’m healed!"LUKE 17
134
16 He fell face down on the ground at
Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he
had done. This man was a Samaritan.
17 Jesus asked, "Didn’t I heal ten men?
Where are the other nine?
18 Does only this foreigner return to
give glory to God?"
19 And Jesus said to the man, "Stand up
and go. Your faith has made you well."
20 One day the Pharisees asked Jesus,
"When will the Kingdom of God come?"
Jesus replied, "The Kingdom of God isn’t
ushered in with visible signs.
21 You won’t be able to say, ‘Here it is!’
or ‘It’s over there!’ For the Kingdom of
God is among you."
22 Later he talked again about this with
his disciples. "The me is coming when
you will long to share in the days of the
Son of Man, but you won’t be able to,"
he said.LUKE 17
135
23 "Reports will reach you that the Son
of Man has returned and that he is in
this place or that. Don’t believe such
reports or go out to look for him.
24 For when the Son of Man returns,
you will know it beyond all doubt. It
will be as evident as the lightning that
ﬂashes across the sky.
25 But ﬁrst the Son of Man must
suﬀer terribly and be rejected by this
genera on.
26 "When the Son of Man returns, the
world will be like the people were in
Noah’s day.
27 In those days before the ﬂood, the
people enjoyed banquets and par es
and weddings right up to the me Noah
entered his boat and the ﬂood came to
destroy them all.
28 "And the world will be as it was in the
days of Lot. People went about their dailyLUKE 17
136
business––ea ng and drinking, buying
and selling, farming and building––
29 un l the morning Lot le Sodom.
Then ﬁre and burning sulfur rained down
from heaven and destroyed them all.
30 Yes, it will be ‘business as usual’ right
up to the hour when the Son of Man
returns.
31 On that day a person outside the
house must not go into the house to
pack. A person in the ﬁeld must not
return to town.
32 Remember what happened to Lot’s
wife!
33 Whoever clings to this life will lose it,
and whoever loses this life will save it.
34 That night two people will be asleep
in one bed; one will be taken away, and
the other will be le .
35 Two women will be grinding ﬂour
together at the mill; one will be taken,
the other le ."LUKE 17 – 18
137
36 [[EMPTY]]
37 "Lord, where will this happen?" the
disciples asked. Jesus replied, "Just as
the gathering of vultures shows there is
a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate
that the end is near."
1 One day Jesus told his disciples
a story to illustrate their need for
constant prayer and to show them that
they must never give up.
2 "There was a judge in a certain city,"
he said, "who was a godless man with
great contempt for everyone.
3 A widow of that city came to him
repeatedly, appealing for jus ce against
someone who had harmed her.
4 The judge ignored her for a while,
but eventually she wore him out. ‘I fear
neither God nor man,’ he said to himself,
5 ‘but this woman is driving me crazy.
I’m going to see that she gets jus ce,
18LUKE 18
138
because she is wearing me out with her
constant requests!’"
6 Then the Lord said, "Learn a lesson
from this evil judge.
7 Even he rendered a just decision in
the end, so don’t you think God will
surely give jus ce to his chosen people
who plead with him day and night? Will
he keep pu ng them oﬀ?
8 I tell you, he will grant jus ce to them
quickly! But when I, the Son of Man,
return, how many will I ﬁnd who have
faith?"
9 Then Jesus told this story to some who
had great self–conﬁdence and scorned
everyone else:
10 "Two men went to the Temple to
pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other
was a dishonest tax collector.
11 The proud Pharisee stood by himself
and prayed this prayer: ‘I thank you,
God, that I am not a sinner like everyoneLUKE 18
139
else, especially like that tax collector
over there! For I never cheat, I don’t sin,
I don’t commit adultery,
12 I fast twice a week, and I give you a
tenth of my income.’
13 "But the tax collector stood at a
distance and dared not even li his eyes
to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat
his chest in sorrow, saying, ‘O God, be
merciful to me, for I am a sinner.’
14 I tell you, this sinner, not the
Pharisee, returned home jus ﬁed before
God. For the proud will be humbled, but
the humble will be honored."
15 One day some parents brought their
li le children to Jesus so he could touch
them and bless them, but the disciples
told them not to bother him.
16 Then Jesus called for the children and
said to the disciples, "Let the children
come to me. Don’t stop them! For theLUKE 18
140
Kingdom of God belongs to such as
these.
17 I assure you, anyone who doesn’t
have their kind of faith will never get
into the Kingdom of God."
18 Once a religious leader asked Jesus
this ques on: "Good teacher, what
should I do to get eternal life?"
19 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus
asked him. "Only God is truly good.
20 But as for your ques on, you know
the commandments: ‘Do not commit
adultery. Do not murder. Do not steal.
Do not tes fy falsely. Honor your father
and mother.’"
21 The man replied, "I’ve obeyed all
these commandments since I was a
child."
22 "There is s ll one thing you lack,"
Jesus said. "Sell all you have and give the
money to the poor, and you will haveLUKE 18
141
treasure in heaven. Then come, follow
me."
23 But when the man heard this, he
became sad because he was very rich.
24 Jesus watched him go and then said
to his disciples, "How hard it is for rich
people to get into the Kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich person
to enter the Kingdom of God!"
26 Those who heard this said, "Then
who in the world can be saved?"
27 He replied, "What is impossible from
a human perspec ve is possible with
God."
28 Peter said, "We have le our homes
and followed you."
29 "Yes," Jesus replied, "and I assure
you, everyone who has given up house or
wife or brothers or parents or children,
for the sake of the Kingdom of God,LUKE 18
30 will be repaid many
142
mes over in this
life, as well as receiving eternal life in the
world to come."
31 Gathering the twelve disciples
around him, Jesus told them, "As you
know, we are going to Jerusalem. And
when we get there, all the predic ons of
the ancient prophets concerning the Son
of Man will come true.
32 He will be handed over to the Romans
to be mocked, treated shamefully, and
spit upon.
33 They will whip him and kill him, but
on the third day he will rise again."
34 But they didn’t understand a thing
he said. Its signiﬁcance was hidden from
them, and they failed to grasp what he
was talking about.
35 As they approached Jericho, a blind
beggar was si ng beside the road.LUKE 18
143
36 When he heard the noise of a
crowd going past, he asked what was
happening.
37 They told him that Jesus of Nazareth
was going by.
38 So he began shou ng, "Jesus, Son of
David, have mercy on me!"
39 The crowds ahead of Jesus tried
to hush the man, but he only shouted
louder, "Son of David, have mercy on
me!"
40 When Jesus heard him, he stopped
and ordered that the man be brought to
him.
41 Then Jesus asked the man, "What do
you want me to do for you?" "Lord," he
pleaded, "I want to see!"
42 And Jesus said, "All right, you can
see! Your faith has healed you."
43 Instantly the man could see, and he
followed Jesus, praising God. And all
who saw it praised God, too.LUKE 19
19
144
1 Jesus entered Jericho and made
his way through the town.
2 There was a man there named
Zacchaeus. He was one of the most
inﬂuen al Jews in the Roman tax–
collec ng business, and he had become
very rich.
3 He tried to get a look at Jesus, but he
was too short to see over the crowds.
4 So he ran ahead and climbed a
sycamore tree beside the road, so he
could watch from there.
5 When Jesus came by, he looked up
at Zacchaeus and called him by name.
"Zacchaeus!" he said. "Quick, come
down! For I must be a guest in your
home today."
6 Zacchaeus quickly climbed down
and took Jesus to his house in great
excitement and joy.LUKE 19
145
7 But the crowds were displeased. "He
has gone to be the guest of a notorious
sinner," they grumbled.
8 Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood there
and said to the Lord, "I will give half my
wealth to the poor, Lord, and if I have
overcharged people on their taxes, I will
give them back four mes as much!"
9 Jesus responded, "Salva on has come
to this home today, for this man has
shown himself to be a son of Abraham.
10 And I, the Son of Man, have come to
seek and save those like him who are
lost."
11 The crowd was listening to everything
Jesus said. And because he was nearing
Jerusalem, he told a story to correct the
impression that the Kingdom of God
would begin right away.
12 He said, "A nobleman was called
away to a distant empire to be crowned
king and then return.LUKE 19
13 Before he le
146
, he called together
ten servants and gave them ten pounds
of silver to invest for him while he was
gone.
14 But his people hated him and sent a
delega on a er him to say they did not
want him to be their king.
15 "When he returned, the king called
in the servants to whom he had given
the money. He wanted to ﬁnd out what
they had done with the money and what
their proﬁts were.
16 The ﬁrst servant reported a
tremendous gain––ten mes as much as
the original amount!
17 ‘Well done!’ the king exclaimed. ‘You
are a trustworthy servant. You have been
faithful with the li le I entrusted to you,
so you will be governor of ten ci es as
your reward.’LUKE 19
147
18 "The next servant also reported
a good gain––ﬁve mes the original
amount.
19 ‘Well done!’ the king said. ‘You can
be governor over ﬁve ci es.’
20 "But the third servant brought back
only the original amount of money and
said, ‘I hid it and kept it safe.
21 I was afraid because you are a hard
man to deal with, taking what isn’t yours
and harves ng crops you didn’t plant.’
22 "‘You wicked servant!’ the king
roared. ‘Hard, am I? If you knew so much
about me and how tough I am,
23 why didn’t you deposit the money
in the bank so I could at least get some
interest on it?’
24 Then turning to the others standing
nearby, the king ordered, ‘Take the
money from this servant, and give it to
the one who earned the most.’LUKE 19
148
25 "‘But, master,’ they said, ‘that servant
has enough already!’
26 "‘Yes,’ the king replied, ‘but to those
who use well what they are given, even
more will be given. But from those who
are unfaithful, even what li le they have
will be taken away.
27 And now about these enemies of
mine who didn’t want me to be their
king––bring them in and execute them
right here in my presence.’"
28 A er telling this story, Jesus went on
toward Jerusalem, walking ahead of his
disciples.
29 As they came to the towns of
Bethphage and Bethany, on the Mount
of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead.
30 "Go into that village over there," he
told them, "and as you enter it, you will
see a colt ed there that has never been
ridden. Un e it and bring it here.LUKE 19
149
31 If anyone asks what you are doing,
just say, ‘The Lord needs it.’"
32 So they went and found the colt, just
as Jesus had said.
33 And sure enough, as they were
untying it, the owners asked them, "Why
are you untying our colt?"
34 And the disciples simply replied, "The
Lord needs it."
35 So they brought the colt to Jesus and
threw their garments over it for him to
ride on.
36 Then the crowds spread out their
coats on the road ahead of Jesus.
37 As they reached the place where the
road started down from the Mount of
Olives, all of his followers began to shout
and sing as they walked along, praising
God for all the wonderful miracles they
had seen.LUKE 19
150
38 "Bless the King who comes in the
name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and
glory in highest heaven!"
39 But some of the Pharisees among
the crowd said, "Teacher, rebuke your
followers for saying things like that!"
40 He replied, "If they kept quiet, the
stones along the road would burst into
cheers!"
41 But as they came closer to Jerusalem
and Jesus saw the city ahead, he began
to cry.
42 "I wish that even today you would
ﬁnd the way of peace. But now it is too
late, and peace is hidden from you.
43 Before long your enemies will build
ramparts against your walls and encircle
you and close in on you.
44 They will crush you to the ground,
and your children with you. Your
enemies will not leave a single stone inLUKE 19 – 20
151
place, because you have rejected the
opportunity God oﬀered you."
45 Then Jesus entered the Temple and
began to drive out the merchants from
their stalls.
46 He told them, "The Scriptures
declare, ‘My Temple will be a place of
prayer,’ but you have turned it into a den
of thieves."
47 A er that, he taught daily in the
Temple, but the leading priests, the
teachers of religious law, and the other
leaders of the people began planning
how to kill him.
48 But they could think of nothing,
because all the people hung on every
word he said.
1 One day as Jesus was teaching
and preaching the Good News
in the Temple, the leading priests and
teachers of religious law and other
leaders came up to him.
20LUKE 20
152
2 They demanded, "By whose authority
did you drive out the merchants from the
Temple? Who gave you such authority?"
3 "Let me ask you a ques on ﬁrst," he
replied.
4 "Did John’s bap sm come from
heaven, or was it merely human?"
5 They talked it over among themselves.
"If we say it was from heaven, he will ask
why we didn’t believe him.
6 But if we say it was merely human,
the people will stone us, because they
are convinced he was a prophet."
7 Finally they replied, "We don’t know."
8 And Jesus responded, "Then I won’t
answer your ques on either."
9 Now Jesus turned to the people again
and told them this story: "A man planted
a vineyard, leased it out to tenant
farmers, and moved to another country
to live for several years.LUKE 20
10 At grape–picking
153
me, he sent one
of his servants to collect his share of
the crop. But the farmers a acked the
servant, beat him up, and sent him back
empty–handed.
11 So the owner sent another servant,
but the same thing happened; he was
beaten up and treated shamefully, and
he went away empty–handed.
12 A third man was sent and the same
thing happened. He, too, was wounded
and chased away.
13 "‘What will I do?’ the owner asked
himself. ‘I know! I’ll send my cherished
son. Surely they will respect him.’
14 "But when the farmers saw his son,
they said to each other, ‘Here comes the
heir to this estate. Let’s kill him and get
the estate for ourselves!’
15 So they dragged him out of the
vineyard and murdered him. "What doLUKE 20
154
you suppose the owner of the vineyard
will do to those farmers?" Jesus asked.
16 "I’ll tell you––he will come and
kill them all and lease the vineyard to
others." "But God forbid that such a
thing should ever happen," his listeners
protested.
17 Jesus looked at them and said, "Then
what do the Scriptures mean? ‘The
stone rejected by the builders has now
become the cornerstone.’
18 All who stumble over that stone will
be broken to pieces, and it will crush
anyone on whom it falls."
19 When the teachers of religious law
and the leading priests heard this story,
they wanted to arrest Jesus immediately
because they realized he was poin ng
at them––that they were the farmers
in the story. But they were afraid there
would be a riot if they arrested him.LUKE 20
155
20 Watching for their opportunity, the
leaders sent secret agents pretending to
be honest men. They tried to get Jesus
to say something that could be reported
to the Roman governor so he would
arrest Jesus.
21 They said, "Teacher, we know that
you speak and teach what is right and
are not inﬂuenced by what others think.
You sincerely teach the ways of God.
22 Now tell us––is it right to pay taxes to
the Roman government or not?"
23 He saw through their trickery and
said,
24 "Show me a Roman coin. Whose
picture and tle are stamped on it?"
"Caesar’s," they replied.
25 "Well then," he said, "give to Caesar
what belongs to him. But everything that
belongs to God must be given to God."
26 So they failed to trap him in the
presence of the people. Instead, theyLUKE 20
156
were amazed by his answer, and they
were silenced.
27 Then some Sadducees stepped
forward––a group of Jews who say there
is no resurrec on a er death.
28 They posed this ques on: "Teacher,
Moses gave us a law that if a man
dies, leaving a wife but no children, his
brother should marry the widow and
have a child who will be the brother’s
heir.
29 Well, there were seven brothers. The
oldest married and then died without
children.
30 His brother married the widow, but
he also died. S ll no children.
31 And so it went, one a er the other,
un l each of the seven had married her
and died, leaving no children.
32 Finally, the woman died, too.LUKE 20
157
33 So tell us, whose wife will she be
in the resurrec on? For all seven were
married to her!"
34 Jesus replied, "Marriage is for people
here on earth.
35 But that is not the way it will be in
the age to come. For those worthy of
being raised from the dead won’t be
married then.
36 And they will never die again. In
these respects they are like angels. They
are children of God raised up to new life.
37 But now, as to whether the dead
will be raised––even Moses proved this
when he wrote about the burning bush.
Long a er Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
had died, he referred to the Lord as ‘the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.’
38 So he is the God of the living, not the
dead. They are all alive to him."LUKE 20
158
39 "Well said, Teacher!" remarked some
of the teachers of religious law who
were standing there.
40 And that ended their ques ons; no
one dared to ask any more.
41 Then Jesus presented them with a
ques on. "Why is it," he asked, "that the
Messiah is said to be the son of David?
42 For David himself wrote in the book
of Psalms: ‘The LORD said to my Lord, Sit
in honor at my right hand
43 un l I humble your enemies, making
them a footstool under your feet.’
44 Since David called him Lord, how can
he be his son at the same me?"
45 Then, with the crowds listening, he
turned to his disciples and said,
46 "Beware of these teachers of
religious law! For they love to parade
in ﬂowing robes and to have everyone
bow to them as they walk in the
marketplaces. And how they love theLUKE 20 – 21
159
seats of honor in the synagogues and at
banquets.
47 But they shamelessly cheat widows
out of their property, and then, to
cover up the kind of people they really
are, they make long prayers in public.
Because of this, their punishment will be
the greater."
1 While Jesus was in the Temple,
he watched the rich people
pu ng their gi s into the collec on box.
2 Then a poor widow came by and
dropped in two pennies.
3 "I assure you," he said, "this poor
widow has given more than all the rest
of them.
4 For they have given a ny part of their
surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given
everything she has."
5 Some of his disciples began talking
about the beau ful stonework of the
21LUKE 21
160
Temple and the memorial decora ons
on the walls. But Jesus said,
6 "The me is coming when all these
things will be so completely demolished
that not one stone will be le on top of
another."
7 "Teacher," they asked, "when will all
this take place? And will there be any
sign ahead of me?"
8 He replied, "Don’t let anyone mislead
you. For many will come in my name,
claiming to be the Messiah and saying,
‘The me has come!’ But don’t believe
them.
9 And when you hear of wars and
insurrec ons, don’t panic. Yes, these
things must come, but the end won’t
follow immediately."
10 Then he added, "Na ons and
kingdoms will proclaim war against each
other.LUKE 21
161
11 There will be great earthquakes, and
there will be famines and epidemics in
many lands, and there will be terrifying
things and great miraculous signs in the
heavens.
12 "But before all this occurs, there will
be a me of great persecu on. You will
be dragged into synagogues and prisons,
and you will be accused before kings and
governors of being my followers.
13 This will be your opportunity to tell
them about me.
14 So don’t worry about how to answer
the charges against you,
15 for I will give you the right words
and such wisdom that none of your
opponents will be able to reply!
16 Even those closest to you––your
parents, brothers, rela ves, and friends–
–will betray you. And some of you will
be killed.LUKE 21
162
17 And everyone will hate you because
of your allegiance to me.
18 But not a hair of your head will
perish!
19 By standing ﬁrm, you will win your
souls.
20 "And when you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies, then you will
know that the me of its destruc on has
arrived.
21 Then those in Judea must ﬂee to the
hills. Let those in Jerusalem escape, and
those outside the city should not enter it
for shelter.
22 For those will be days of God’s
vengeance, and the prophe c words of
the Scriptures will be fulﬁlled.
23 How terrible it will be for pregnant
women and for mothers nursing their
babies. For there will be great distress in
the land and wrath upon this people.LUKE 21
163
24 They will be brutally killed by the
sword or sent away as cap ves to all the
na ons of the world. And Jerusalem will
be conquered and trampled down by
the Gen les un l the age of the Gen les
comes to an end.
25 "And there will be strange events
in the skies––signs in the sun, moon,
and stars. And down here on earth the
na ons will be in turmoil, perplexed by
the roaring seas and strange des.
26 The courage of many people will
falter because of the fearful fate they
see coming upon the earth, because
the stability of the very heavens will be
broken up.
27 Then everyone will see the Son of
Man arrive on the clouds with power
and great glory.
28 So when all these things begin to
happen, stand straight and look up, for
your salva on is near!"LUKE 21
29 Then he gave them this illustra
164
on:
"No ce the ﬁg tree, or any other tree.
30 When the leaves come out, you know
without being told that summer is near.
31 Just so, when you see the events I’ve
described taking place, you can be sure
that the Kingdom of God is near.
32 I assure you, this genera on will
not pass from the scene un l all these
events have taken place.
33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but
my words will remain forever.
34 "Watch out! Don’t let me ﬁnd you
living in careless ease and drunkenness,
and ﬁlled with the worries of this life.
Don’t let that day catch you unaware,
35 as in a trap. For that day will come
upon everyone living on the earth.
36 Keep a constant watch. And pray
that, if possible, you may escape these
horrors and stand before the Son of
Man."LUKE 21 – 22
165
37 Every day Jesus went to the Temple
to teach, and each evening he returned
to spend the night on the Mount of
Olives.
38 The crowds gathered early each
morning to hear him.
1 The Fes val of Unleavened
Bread, which begins with the
Passover celebra on, was drawing near.
2 The leading priests and teachers of
religious law were ac vely plo ng Jesus’
murder. But they wanted to kill him
without star ng a riot, a possibility they
greatly feared.
3 Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot,
who was one of the twelve disciples,
4 and he went over to the leading
priests and captains of the Temple guard
to discuss the best way to betray Jesus
to them.
22LUKE 22
166
5 They were delighted that he was
ready to help them, and they promised
him a reward.
6 So he began looking for an opportunity
to betray Jesus so they could arrest
him quietly when the crowds weren’t
around.
7 Now the Fes val of Unleavened Bread
arrived, when the Passover lambs were
sacriﬁced.
8 Jesus sent Peter and John ahead and
said, "Go and prepare the Passover
meal, so we can eat it together."
9 "Where do you want us to go?" they
asked him.
10 He replied, "As soon as you enter
Jerusalem, a man carrying a pitcher of
water will meet you. Follow him. At the
house he enters,
11 say to the owner, ‘The Teacher asks,
Where is the guest room where I can eat
the Passover meal with my disciples?’LUKE 22
167
12 He will take you upstairs to a large
room that is already set up. That is the
place. Go ahead and prepare our supper
there."
13 They went oﬀ to the city and found
everything just as Jesus had said, and
they prepared the Passover supper
there.
14 Then at the proper me Jesus and
the twelve apostles sat down together
at the table.
15 Jesus said, "I have looked forward to
this hour with deep longing, anxious to
eat this Passover meal with you before
my suﬀering begins.
16 For I tell you now that I won’t eat it
again un l it comes to fulﬁllment in the
Kingdom of God."
17 Then he took a cup of wine, and
when he had given thanks for it, he said,
"Take this and share it among yourselves.LUKE 22
18 For I will not drink wine again un
168
l
the Kingdom of God has come."
19 Then he took a loaf of bread; and
when he had thanked God for it, he
broke it in pieces and gave it to the
disciples, saying, "This is my body, given
for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
20 A er supper he took another cup of
wine and said, "This wine is the token
of God’s new covenant to save you––an
agreement sealed with the blood I will
pour out for you.
21 "But here at this table, si ng among
us as a friend, is the man who will betray
me.
22 For I, the Son of Man, must die since
it is part of God’s plan. But how terrible
it will be for my betrayer!"
23 Then the disciples began to ask each
other which of them would ever do such
a thing.LUKE 22
169
24 And they began to argue among
themselves as to who would be the
greatest in the coming Kingdom.
25 Jesus told them, "In this world the
kings and great men order their people
around, and yet they are called ‘friends
of the people.’
26 But among you, those who are the
greatest should take the lowest rank,
and the leader should be like a servant.
27 Normally the master sits at the table
and is served by his servants. But not
here! For I am your servant.
28 You have remained true to me in my
me of trial.
29 And just as my Father has granted
me a Kingdom, I now grant you the right
30 to eat and drink at my table in that
Kingdom. And you will sit on thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
31 "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to
have all of you, to si you like wheat.LUKE 22
170
32 But I have pleaded in prayer for you,
Simon, that your faith should not fail. So
when you have repented and turned to
me again, strengthen and build up your
brothers."
33 Peter said, "Lord, I am ready to go to
prison with you, and even to die with
you."
34 But Jesus said, "Peter, let me tell
you something. The rooster will not
crow tomorrow morning un l you have
denied three mes that you even know
me."
35 Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent
you out to preach the Good News and
you did not have money, a traveler’s bag,
or extra clothing, did you lack anything?"
"No," they replied.
36 "But now," he said, "take your money
and a traveler’s bag. And if you don’t
have a sword, sell your clothes and buy
one!LUKE 22
37 For the
171
me has come for this
prophecy about me to be fulﬁlled: ‘He
was counted among those who were
rebels.’ Yes, everything wri en about me
by the prophets will come true."
38 "Lord," they replied, "we have two
swords among us." "That’s enough," he
said.
39 Then, accompanied by the disciples,
Jesus le the upstairs room and went as
usual to the Mount of Olives.
40 There he told them, "Pray that you
will not be overcome by tempta on."
41 He walked away, about a stone’s
throw, and knelt down and prayed,
42 "Father, if you are willing, please take
this cup of suﬀering away from me. Yet I
want your will, not mine."
43 Then an angel from heaven appeared
and strengthened him.
44 He prayed more fervently, and he
was in such agony of spirit that his sweatLUKE 22
172
fell to the ground like great drops of
blood.
45 At last he stood up again and
returned to the disciples, only to ﬁnd
them asleep, exhausted from grief.
46 "Why are you sleeping?" he asked.
"Get up and pray. Otherwise tempta on
will overpower you."
47 But even as he said this, a mob
approached, led by Judas, one of his
twelve disciples. Judas walked over to
Jesus and greeted him with a kiss.
48 But Jesus said, "Judas, how can you
betray me, the Son of Man, with a kiss?"
49 When the other disciples saw what
was about to happen, they exclaimed,
"Lord, should we ﬁght? We brought the
swords!"
50 And one of them slashed at the high
priest’s servant and cut oﬀ his right ear.
51 But Jesus said, "Don’t resist
anymore." And he touched the placeLUKE 22
173
where the man’s ear had been and
healed him.
52 Then Jesus spoke to the leading
priests and captains of the Temple guard
and the other leaders who headed the
mob. "Am I some dangerous criminal,"
he asked, "that you have come armed
with swords and clubs to arrest me?
53 Why didn’t you arrest me in the
Temple? I was there every day. But this is
your moment, the me when the power
of darkness reigns."
54 So they arrested him and led him to
the high priest’s residence, and Peter
was following far behind.
55 The guards lit a ﬁre in the courtyard
and sat around it, and Peter joined them
there.
56 A servant girl no ced him in the
ﬁrelight and began staring at him. Finally
she said, "This man was one of Jesus’
followers!"LUKE 22
174
57 Peter denied it. "Woman," he said, "I
don’t even know the man!"
58 A er a while someone else looked
at him and said, "You must be one
of them!" "No, man, I’m not!" Peter
replied.
59 About an hour later someone else
insisted, "This must be one of Jesus’
disciples because he is a Galilean, too."
60 But Peter said, "Man, I don’t know
what you are talking about." And as
soon as he said these words, the rooster
crowed.
61 At that moment the Lord turned and
looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered
that the Lord had said, "Before the
rooster crows tomorrow morning, you
will deny me three mes."
62 And Peter le the courtyard, crying
bi erly.
63 Now the guards in charge of Jesus
began mocking and bea ng him.LUKE 22
175
64 They blindfolded him; then they hit
him and asked, "Who hit you that me,
you prophet?"
65 And they threw all sorts of terrible
insults at him.
66 At daybreak all the leaders of the
people assembled, including the leading
priests and the teachers of religious law.
Jesus was led before this high council,
67 and they said, "Tell us if you are the
Messiah." But he replied, "If I tell you,
you won’t believe me.
68 And if I ask you a ques on, you won’t
answer.
69 But the me is soon coming when I,
the Son of Man, will be si ng at God’s
right hand in the place of power."
70 They all shouted, "Then you claim
you are the Son of God?" And he replied,
"You are right in saying that I am."LUKE 22 – 23
176
71 "What need do we have for other
witnesses?" they shouted. "We ourselves
heard him say it."
1 Then the en re council took
Jesus over to Pilate, the Roman
governor.
2 They began at once to state their case:
"This man has been leading our people
to ruin by telling them not to pay their
taxes to the Roman government and by
claiming he is the Messiah, a king."
3 So Pilate asked him, "Are you the King
of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as
you say."
4 Pilate turned to the leading priests
and to the crowd and said, "I ﬁnd
nothing wrong with this man!"
5 Then they became desperate. "But he
is causing riots everywhere he goes, all
over Judea, from Galilee to Jerusalem!"
6 "Oh, is he a Galilean?" Pilate asked.
23LUKE 23
177
7 When they answered that he was,
Pilate sent him to Herod An pas,
because Galilee was under Herod’s
jurisdic on, and Herod happened to be
in Jerusalem at the me.
8 Herod was delighted at the
opportunity to see Jesus, because he
had heard about him and had been
hoping for a long me to see him
perform a miracle.
9 He asked Jesus ques on a er
ques on, but Jesus refused to answer.
10 Meanwhile, the leading priests and
the teachers of religious law stood there
shou ng their accusa ons.
11 Now Herod and his soldiers began
mocking and ridiculing Jesus. Then they
put a royal robe on him and sent him
back to Pilate.
12 Herod and Pilate, who had been
enemies before, became friends that
day.LUKE 23
178
13 Then Pilate called together the
leading priests and other religious
leaders, along with the people,
14 and he announced his verdict. "You
brought this man to me, accusing him
of leading a revolt. I have examined
him thoroughly on this point in your
presence and ﬁnd him innocent.
15 Herod came to the same conclusion
and sent him back to us. Nothing this
man has done calls for the death penalty.
16 So I will have him ﬂogged, but then I
will release him."
17 [[EMPTY]]
18 Then a mighty roar rose from the
crowd, and with one voice they shouted,
"Kill him, and release Barabbas to us!"
19 (Barabbas was in prison for murder
and for taking part in an insurrec on in
Jerusalem against the government.)
20 Pilate argued with them, because he
wanted to release Jesus.LUKE 23
179
21 But they shouted, "Crucify him!
Crucify him!"
22 For the third me he demanded,
"Why? What crime has he commi ed?
I have found no reason to sentence him
to death. I will therefore ﬂog him and let
him go."
23 But the crowd shouted louder and
louder for Jesus’ death, and their voices
prevailed.
24 So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as
they demanded.
25 As they had requested, he released
Barabbas, the man in prison for
insurrec on and murder. But he
delivered Jesus over to them to do as
they wished.
26 As they led Jesus away, Simon of
Cyrene, who was coming in from the
country just then, was forced to follow
Jesus and carry his cross.LUKE 23
180
27 Great crowds trailed along behind,
including many grief–stricken women.
28 But Jesus turned and said to them,
"Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep
for me, but weep for yourselves and for
your children.
29 For the days are coming when they
will say, ‘Fortunate indeed are the
women who are childless, the wombs
that have not borne a child and the
breasts that have never nursed.’
30 People will beg the mountains to fall
on them and the hills to bury them.
31 For if these things are done when the
tree is green, what will happen when it
is dry?"
32 Two others, both criminals, were led
out to be executed with him.
33 Finally, they came to a place called
The Skull. All three were cruciﬁed
there––Jesus on the center cross, and
the two criminals on either side.LUKE 23
181
34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive these
people, because they don’t know
what they are doing." And the soldiers
gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.
35 The crowd watched, and the leaders
laughed and scoﬀed. "He saved others,"
they said, "let him save himself if he is
really God’s Chosen One, the Messiah."
36 The soldiers mocked him, too, by
oﬀering him a drink of sour wine.
37 They called out to him, "If you are
the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
38 A signboard was nailed to the cross
above him with these words: "This is the
King of the Jews."
39 One of the criminals hanging beside
him scoﬀed, "So you’re the Messiah, are
you? Prove it by saving yourself––and
us, too, while you’re at it!"
40 But the other criminal protested,
"Don’t you fear God even when you are
dying?LUKE 23
182
41 We deserve to die for our evil deeds,
but this man hasn’t done anything
wrong."
42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
when you come into your Kingdom."
43 And Jesus replied, "I assure you,
today you will be with me in paradise."
44 By this me it was noon, and
darkness fell across the whole land un l
three o’clock.
45 The light from the sun was gone. And
suddenly, the thick veil hanging in the
Temple was torn apart.
46 Then Jesus shouted, "Father, I entrust
my spirit into your hands!" And with
those words he breathed his last.
47 When the captain of the Roman
soldiers handling the execu ons saw
what had happened, he praised God and
said, "Surely this man was innocent."
48 And when the crowd that came
to see the cruciﬁxion saw all that hadLUKE 23
183
happened, they went home in deep
sorrow.
49 But Jesus’ friends, including the
women who had followed him from
Galilee, stood at a distance watching.
50 Now there was a good and righteous
man named Joseph. He was a member
of the Jewish high council,
51 but he had not agreed with the
decision and ac ons of the other
religious leaders. He was from the town
of Arimathea in Judea, and he had been
wai ng for the Kingdom of God to come.
52 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’
body.
53 Then he took the body down from
the cross and wrapped it in a long linen
cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had
been carved out of rock.
54 This was done late on Friday
a ernoon, the day of prepara on for the
Sabbath.LUKE 23 – 24
184
55 As his body was taken away, the
women from Galilee followed and saw
the tomb where they placed his body.
56 Then they went home and prepared
spices and ointments to embalm him.
But by the me they were ﬁnished it was
the Sabbath, so they rested all that day
as required by the law.
1 But very early on Sunday
morning the women came to
the tomb, taking the spices they had
prepared.
2 They found that the stone covering
the entrance had been rolled aside.
3 So they went in, but they couldn’t ﬁnd
the body of the Lord Jesus.
4 They were puzzled, trying to think
what could have happened to it.
Suddenly, two men appeared to them,
clothed in dazzling robes.
5 The women were terriﬁed and bowed
low before them. Then the men asked,
24LUKE 24
185
"Why are you looking in a tomb for
someone who is alive?
6 He isn’t here! He has risen from the
dead! Don’t you remember what he told
you back in Galilee,
7 that the Son of Man must be betrayed
into the hands of sinful men and be
cruciﬁed, and that he would rise again
the third day?"
8 Then they remembered that he had
said this.
9 So they rushed back to tell his eleven
disciples––and everyone else––what
had happened.
10 The women who went to the tomb
were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary
the mother of James, and several
others. They told the apostles what had
happened,
11 but the story sounded like nonsense,
so they didn’t believe it.LUKE 24
186
12 However, Peter ran to the tomb to
look. Stooping, he peered in and saw
the empty linen wrappings; then he
went home again, wondering what had
happened.
13 That same day two of Jesus’ followers
were walking to the village of Emmaus,
seven miles out of Jerusalem.
14 As they walked along they were
talking about everything that had
happened.
15 Suddenly, Jesus himself came along
and joined them and began walking
beside them.
16 But they didn’t know who he was,
because God kept them from recognizing
him.
17 "You seem to be in a deep discussion
about something," he said. "What are
you so concerned about?" They stopped
short, sadness wri en across their faces.LUKE 24
187
18 Then one of them, Cleopas, replied,
"You must be the only person in
Jerusalem who hasn’t heard about all
the things that have happened there the
last few days."
19 "What things?" Jesus asked. "The
things that happened to Jesus, the man
from Nazareth," they said. "He was a
prophet who did wonderful miracles. He
was a mighty teacher, highly regarded by
both God and all the people.
20 But our leading priests and other
religious leaders arrested him and
handed him over to be condemned to
death, and they cruciﬁed him.
21 We had thought he was the Messiah
who had come to rescue Israel. That all
happened three days ago.
22 Then some women from our group
of his followers were at his tomb early
this morning, and they came back with
an amazing report.LUKE 24
188
23 They said his body was missing, and
they had seen angels who told them
Jesus is alive!
24 Some of our men ran out to see, and
sure enough, Jesus’ body was gone, just
as the women had said."
25 Then Jesus said to them, "You are
such foolish people! You ﬁnd it so hard
to believe all that the prophets wrote in
the Scriptures.
26 Wasn’t it clearly predicted by the
prophets that the Messiah would have
to suﬀer all these things before entering
his me of glory?"
27 Then Jesus quoted passages from the
wri ngs of Moses and all the prophets,
explaining what all the Scriptures said
about himself.
28 By this me they were nearing
Emmaus and the end of their journey.
Jesus would have gone on,LUKE 24
189
29 but they begged him to stay the night
with them, since it was ge ng late. So
he went home with them.
30 As they sat down to eat, he took a
small loaf of bread, asked God’s blessing
on it, broke it, then gave it to them.
31 Suddenly, their eyes were opened,
and they recognized him. And at that
moment he disappeared!
32 They said to each other, "Didn’t our
hearts feel strangely warm as he talked
with us on the road and explained the
Scriptures to us?"
33 And within the hour they were on
their way back to Jerusalem, where the
eleven disciples and the other followers
of Jesus were gathered. When they
arrived, they were greeted with the
report,
34 "The Lord has really risen! He
appeared to Peter!"LUKE 24
190
35 Then the two from Emmaus told
their story of how Jesus had appeared
to them as they were walking along the
road and how they had recognized him
as he was breaking the bread.
36 And just as they were telling about
it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing
there among them. He said, "Peace be
with you."
37 But the whole group was terribly
frightened, thinking they were seeing a
ghost!
38 "Why are you frightened?" he asked.
"Why do you doubt who I am?
39 Look at my hands. Look at my feet.
You can see that it’s really me. Touch me
and make sure that I am not a ghost,
because ghosts don’t have bodies, as
you see that I do!"
40 As he spoke, he held out his hands
for them to see, and he showed them
his feet.LUKE 24
41 S
191
ll they stood there doub ng, ﬁlled
with joy and wonder. Then he asked
them, "Do you have anything here to
eat?"
42 They gave him a piece of broiled ﬁsh,
43 and he ate it as they watched.
44 Then he said, "When I was with you
before, I told you that everything wri en
about me by Moses and the prophets
and in the Psalms must all come true."
45 Then he opened their minds to
understand these many Scriptures.
46 And he said, "Yes, it was wri en long
ago that the Messiah must suﬀer and
die and rise again from the dead on the
third day.
47 With my authority, take this message
of repentance to all the na ons,
beginning in Jerusalem: ‘There is
forgiveness of sins for all who turn to
me.’
48 You are witnesses of all these things.LUKE 24
192
49 "And now I will send the Holy Spirit,
just as my Father promised. But stay here
in the city un l the Holy Spirit comes
and ﬁlls you with power from heaven."
50 Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and
li ing his hands to heaven, he blessed
them.
51 While he was blessing them, he le
them and was taken up to heaven.
52 They worshiped him and then
returned to Jerusalem ﬁlled with great
joy.
53 And they spent all of their me in the
Temple, praising God.John
1
1 In the beginning the Word already
existed. He was with God, and he
was God.
2 He was in the beginning with God.
3 He created everything there is.
Nothing exists that he didn’t make.
4 Life itself was in him, and this life gives
light to everyone.
5 The light shines through the darkness,
and the darkness can never ex nguish it.
6 God sent John the Bap st
7 to tell everyone about the light so that
everyone might believe because of his
tes mony.
8 John himself was not the light; he was
only a witness to the light.JOHN 1
2
9 The one who is the true light, who
gives light to everyone, was going to
come into the world.
10 But although the world was made
through him, the world didn’t recognize
him when he came.
11 Even in his own land and among his
own people, he was not accepted.
12 But to all who believed him and
accepted him, he gave the right to
become children of God.
13 They are reborn! This is not a physical
birth resul ng from human passion or
plan––this rebirth comes from God.
14 So the Word became human and
lived here on earth among us. He was
full of unfailing love and faithfulness.
And we have seen his glory, the glory of
the only Son of the Father.
15 John pointed him out to the people.
He shouted to the crowds, "This is the
one I was talking about when I said,JOHN 1
3
‘Someone is coming who is far greater
than I am, for he existed long before I
did.’"
16 We have all beneﬁted from the
rich blessings he brought to us––one
gracious blessing a er another.
17 For the law was given through Moses;
God’s unfailing love and faithfulness
came through Jesus Christ.
18 No one has ever seen God. But his
only Son, who is himself God, is near to
the Father’s heart; he has told us about
him.
19 This was the tes mony of John when
the Jewish leaders sent priests and
Temple assistants from Jerusalem to
ask John whether he claimed to be the
Messiah.
20 He ﬂatly denied it. "I am not the
Messiah," he said.JOHN 1
4
21 "Well then, who are you?" they
asked. "Are you Elijah?" "No," he replied.
"Are you the Prophet?" "No."
22 "Then who are you? Tell us, so we
can give an answer to those who sent
us. What do you have to say about
yourself?"
23 John replied in the words of Isaiah: "I
am a voice shou ng in the wilderness,
‘Prepare a straight pathway for the
Lord’s coming!’"
24 Then those who were sent by the
Pharisees
25 asked him, "If you aren’t the Messiah
or Elijah or the Prophet, what right do
you have to bap ze?"
26 John told them, "I bap ze with water,
but right here in the crowd is someone
you do not know,
27 who will soon begin his ministry. I am
not even worthy to be his slave."JOHN 1
5
28 This incident took place at Bethany,
a village east of the Jordan River, where
John was bap zing.
29 The next day John saw Jesus coming
toward him and said, "Look! There is the
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
the world!
30 He is the one I was talking about
when I said, ‘Soon a man is coming who
is far greater than I am, for he existed
long before I did.’
31 I didn’t know he was the one, but I
have been bap zing with water in order
to point him out to Israel."
32 Then John said, "I saw the Holy Spirit
descending like a dove from heaven and
res ng upon him.
33 I didn’t know he was the one, but
when God sent me to bap ze with
water, he told me, ‘When you see the
Holy Spirit descending and res ng upon
someone, he is the one you are lookingJOHN 1
6
for. He is the one who bap zes with the
Holy Spirit.’
34 I saw this happen to Jesus, so I tes fy
that he is the Son of God."
35 The following day, John was again
standing with two of his disciples.
36 As Jesus walked by, John looked at
him and then declared, "Look! There is
the Lamb of God!"
37 Then John’s two disciples turned and
followed Jesus.
38 Jesus looked around and saw them
following. "What do you want?" he
asked them. They replied, "Rabbi"
(which means Teacher), "where are you
staying?"
39 "Come and see," he said. It was
about four o’clock in the a ernoon when
they went with him to the place, and
they stayed there the rest of the day.JOHN 1
7
40 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was
one of these men who had heard what
John said and then followed Jesus.
41 The ﬁrst thing Andrew did was to ﬁnd
his brother, Simon, and tell him, "We
have found the Messiah" (which means
the Christ).
42 Then Andrew brought Simon to
meet Jesus. Looking intently at Simon,
Jesus said, "You are Simon, the son of
John––but you will be called Cephas"
(which means Peter).
43 The next day Jesus decided to go to
Galilee. He found Philip and said to him,
"Come, be my disciple."
44 Philip was from Bethsaida, Andrew
and Peter’s hometown.
45 Philip went oﬀ to look for Nathanael
and told him, "We have found the very
person Moses and the prophets wrote
about! His name is Jesus, the son of
Joseph from Nazareth."JOHN 1
8
46 "Nazareth!" exclaimed Nathanael.
"Can anything good come from there?"
"Just come and see for yourself," Philip
said.
47 As they approached, Jesus said,
"Here comes an honest man––a true son
of Israel."
48 "How do you know about me?"
Nathanael asked. And Jesus replied, "I
could see you under the ﬁg tree before
Philip found you."
49 Nathanael replied, "Teacher, you are
the Son of God––the King of Israel!"
50 Jesus asked him, "Do you believe all
this just because I told you I had seen
you under the ﬁg tree? You will see
greater things than this."
51 Then he said, "The truth is, you will
all see heaven open and the angels of
God going up and down upon the Son of
Man."JOHN 2

1 The next day Jesus’ mother was a
guest at a wedding celebra on in the
village of Cana in Galilee.
2 Jesus and his disciples were also
invited to the celebra on.
3 The wine supply ran out during the
fes vi es, so Jesus’ mother spoke to him
about the problem. "They have no more
wine," she told him.
4 "How does that concern you and
me?" Jesus asked. "My me has not yet
come."
5 But his mother told the servants, "Do
whatever he tells you."
6 Six stone waterpots were standing
there; they were used for Jewish
ceremonial purposes and held twenty to
thirty gallons each.
7 Jesus told the servants, "Fill the jars
with water." When the jars had been
ﬁlled to the brim,JOHN 2
10
8 he said, "Dip some out and take it
to the master of ceremonies." So they
followed his instruc ons.
9 When the master of ceremonies
tasted the water that was now wine,
not knowing where it had come from
(though, of course, the servants knew),
he called the bridegroom over.
10 "Usually a host serves the best wine
ﬁrst," he said. "Then, when everyone is
full and doesn’t care, he brings out the
less expensive wines. But you have kept
the best un l now!"
11 This miraculous sign at Cana in
Galilee was Jesus’ ﬁrst display of his
glory. And his disciples believed in him.
12 A er the wedding he went to
Capernaum for a few days with his
mother, his brothers, and his disciples.
13 It was me for the annual Passover
celebra on, and Jesus went to
Jerusalem.JOHN 2
11
14 In the Temple area he saw merchants
selling ca le, sheep, and doves for
sacriﬁces; and he saw money changers
behind their counters.
15 Jesus made a whip from some ropes
and chased them all out of the Temple.
He drove out the sheep and oxen,
sca ered the money changers’ coins
over the ﬂoor, and turned over their
tables.
16 Then, going over to the people
who sold doves, he told them, "Get
these things out of here. Don’t turn my
Father’s house into a marketplace!"
17 Then his disciples remembered this
prophecy from the Scriptures: "Passion
for God’s house burns within me."
18 "What right do you have to do these
things?" the Jewish leaders demanded.
"If you have this authority from God,
show us a miraculous sign to prove it."JOHN 2
12
19 "All right," Jesus replied. "Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up."
20 "What!" they exclaimed. "It took
forty–six years to build this Temple, and
you can do it in three days?"
21 But by "this temple," Jesus meant his
body.
22 A er he was raised from the dead,
the disciples remembered that he had
said this. And they believed both Jesus
and the Scriptures.
23 Because of the miraculous signs
he did in Jerusalem at the Passover
celebra on, many people were
convinced that he was indeed the
Messiah.
24 But Jesus didn’t trust them, because
he knew what people were really like.
25 No one needed to tell him about
human nature.JOHN 3
1A
13
er dark one evening, a Jewish
religious leader named Nicodemus,
a Pharisee,
2 came to speak with Jesus. "Teacher,"
he said, "we all know that God has sent
you to teach us. Your miraculous signs
are proof enough that God is with you."
3 Jesus replied, "I assure you, unless
you are born again, you can never see
the Kingdom of God."
4 "What do you mean?" exclaimed
Nicodemus. "How can an old man go
back into his mother’s womb and be
born again?"
5 Jesus replied, "The truth is, no one
can enter the Kingdom of God without
being born of water and the Spirit.
6 Humans can reproduce only human
life, but the Holy Spirit gives new life
from heaven.
7 So don’t be surprised at my statement
that you must be born again.
3JOHN 3
14
8 Just as you can hear the wind but can’t
tell where it comes from or where it is
going, so you can’t explain how people
are born of the Spirit."
9 "What do you mean?" Nicodemus
asked.
10 Jesus replied, "You are a respected
Jewish teacher, and yet you don’t
understand these things?
11 I assure you, I am telling you what we
know and have seen, and yet you won’t
believe us.
12 But if you don’t even believe me
when I tell you about things that happen
here on earth, how can you possibly
believe if I tell you what is going on in
heaven?
13 For only I, the Son of Man, have come
to earth and will return to heaven again.
14 And as Moses li ed up the bronze
snake on a pole in the wilderness, so I,JOHN 3
15
the Son of Man, must be li ed up on a
pole,
15 so that everyone who believes in me
will have eternal life.
16 "For God so loved the world that he
gave his only Son, so that everyone who
believes in him will not perish but have
eternal life.
17 God did not send his Son into the
world to condemn it, but to save it.
18 "There is no judgment awai ng those
who trust him. But those who do not
trust him have already been judged for
not believing in the only Son of God.
19 Their judgment is based on this fact:
The light from heaven came into the
world, but they loved the darkness more
than the light, for their ac ons were evil.
20 They hate the light because they
want to sin in the darkness. They stay
away from the light for fear their sins will
be exposed and they will be punished.JOHN 3
16
21 But those who do what is right come
to the light gladly, so everyone can see
that they are doing what God wants."
22 A erward Jesus and his disciples le
Jerusalem, but they stayed in Judea for a
while and bap zed there.
23 At this me John the Bap st was
bap zing at Aenon, near Salim, because
there was plenty of water there and
people kept coming to him for bap sm.
24 This was before John was put into
prison.
25 At that me a certain Jew began
an argument with John’s disciples over
ceremonial cleansing.
26 John’s disciples came to him and said,
"Teacher, the man you met on the other
side of the Jordan River, the one you
said was the Messiah, is also bap zing
people. And everybody is going over
there instead of coming here to us."JOHN 3
17
27 John replied, "God in heaven
appoints each person’s work.
28 You yourselves know how plainly I
told you that I am not the Messiah. I am
here to prepare the way for him––that is
all.
29 The bride will go where the
bridegroom is. A bridegroom’s friend
rejoices with him. I am the bridegroom’s
friend, and I am ﬁlled with joy at his
success.
30 He must become greater and greater,
and I must become less and less.
31 "He has come from above and is
greater than anyone else. I am of the
earth, and my understanding is limited
to the things of earth, but he has come
from heaven.
32 He tells what he has seen and heard,
but how few believe what he tells them!
33 Those who believe him discover that
God is true.JOHN 3 – 4
18
34 For he is sent by God. He speaks
God’s words, for God’s Spirit is upon him
without measure or limit.
35 The Father loves his Son, and he has
given him authority over everything.
36 And all who believe in God’s Son
have eternal life. Those who don’t obey
the Son will never experience eternal
life, but the wrath of God remains upon
them."
1 Jesus learned that the Pharisees
had heard, "Jesus is bap zing and
making more disciples than John"
2 (though Jesus himself didn’t bap ze
them––his disciples did).
3 So he le Judea to return to Galilee.
4 He had to go through Samaria on the
way.
5 Eventually he came to the Samaritan
village of Sychar, near the parcel of
ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
4JOHN 4
19
6 Jacob’s well was there; and Jesus,
red from the long walk, sat wearily
beside the well about noon me.
7 Soon a Samaritan woman came
to draw water, and Jesus said to her,
"Please give me a drink."
8 He was alone at the me because his
disciples had gone into the village to buy
some food.
9 The woman was surprised, for Jews
refuse to have anything to do with
Samaritans. She said to Jesus, "You are a
Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman. Why
are you asking me for a drink?"
10 Jesus replied, "If you only knew the
gi God has for you and who I am, you
would ask me, and I would give you
living water."
11 "But sir, you don’t have a rope or
a bucket," she said, "and this is a very
deep well. Where would you get this
living water?JOHN 4
20
12 And besides, are you greater than our
ancestor Jacob who gave us this well?
How can you oﬀer be er water than he
and his sons and his ca le enjoyed?"
13 Jesus replied, "People soon become
thirsty again a er drinking this water.
14 But the water I give them takes away
thirst altogether. It becomes a perpetual
spring within them, giving them eternal
life."
15 "Please, sir," the woman said, "give
me some of that water! Then I’ll never
be thirsty again, and I won’t have to
come here to haul water."
16 "Go and get your husband," Jesus
told her.
17 "I don’t have a husband," the woman
replied. Jesus said, "You’re right! You
don’t have a husband––
18 for you have had ﬁve husbands, and
you aren’t even married to the man
you’re living with now."JOHN 4
21
19 "Sir," the woman said, "you must be
a prophet.
20 So tell me, why is it that you Jews
insist that Jerusalem is the only place
of worship, while we Samaritans claim
it is here at Mount Gerizim, where our
ancestors worshiped?"
21 Jesus replied, "Believe me, the me
is coming when it will no longer ma er
whether you worship the Father here or
in Jerusalem.
22 You Samaritans know so li le about
the one you worship, while we Jews
know all about him, for salva on comes
through the Jews.
23 But the me is coming and is already
here when true worshipers will worship
the Father in spirit and in truth. The
Father is looking for anyone who will
worship him that way.JOHN 4
22
24 For God is Spirit, so those who
worship him must worship in spirit and
in truth."
25 The woman said, "I know the
Messiah will come––the one who is
called Christ. When he comes, he will
explain everything to us."
26 Then Jesus told her, "I am the
Messiah!"
27 Just then his disciples arrived. They
were astonished to ﬁnd him talking to
a woman, but none of them asked him
why he was doing it or what they had
been discussing.
28 The woman le her water jar beside
the well and went back to the village and
told everyone,
29 "Come and meet a man who told me
everything I ever did! Can this be the
Messiah?"
30 So the people came streaming from
the village to see him.JOHN 4
23
31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging
Jesus to eat.
32 "No," he said, "I have food you don’t
know about."
33 "Who brought it to him?" the
disciples asked each other.
34 Then Jesus explained: "My
nourishment comes from doing the will
of God, who sent me, and from ﬁnishing
his work.
35 Do you think the work of harves ng
will not begin un l the summer ends
four months from now? Look around
you! Vast ﬁelds are ripening all around
us and are ready now for the harvest.
36 The harvesters are paid good wages,
and the fruit they harvest is people
brought to eternal life. What joy awaits
both the planter and the harvester alike!
37 You know the saying, ‘One person
plants and someone else harvests.’ And
it’s true.JOHN 4
24
38 I sent you to harvest where you
didn’t plant; others had already done the
work, and you will gather the harvest."
39 Many Samaritans from the village
believed in Jesus because the woman
had said, "He told me everything I ever
did!"
40 When they came out to see him, they
begged him to stay at their village. So he
stayed for two days,
41 long enough for many of them to
hear his message and believe.
42 Then they said to the woman, "Now
we believe because we have heard him
ourselves, not just because of what you
told us. He is indeed the Savior of the
world."
43 At the end of the two days’ stay,
Jesus went on into Galilee.
44 He had previously said, "A prophet is
honored everywhere except in his own
country."JOHN 4
25
45 The Galileans welcomed him, for
they had been in Jerusalem at the
Passover celebra on and had seen all his
miraculous signs.
46 In the course of his journey through
Galilee, he arrived at the town of Cana,
where he had turned the water into
wine. There was a government oﬃcial in
the city of Capernaum whose son was
very sick.
47 When he heard that Jesus had come
from Judea and was traveling in Galilee,
he went over to Cana. He found Jesus
and begged him to come to Capernaum
with him to heal his son, who was about
to die.
48 Jesus asked, "Must I do miraculous
signs and wonders before you people
will believe in me?"
49 The oﬃcial pleaded, "Lord, please
come now before my li le boy dies."JOHN 4 – 5
26
50 Then Jesus told him, "Go back home.
Your son will live!" And the man believed
Jesus’ word and started home.
51 While he was on his way, some of his
servants met him with the news that his
son was alive and well.
52 He asked them when the boy had
begun to feel be er, and they replied,
"Yesterday a ernoon at one o’clock his
fever suddenly disappeared!"
53 Then the father realized it was the
same me that Jesus had told him, "Your
son will live." And the oﬃcer and his
en re household believed in Jesus.
54 This was Jesus’ second miraculous
sign in Galilee a er coming from Judea.
1 A erward Jesus returned to
Jerusalem for one of the Jewish holy
days.
2 Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate,
was the pool of Bethesda, with ﬁve
covered porches.
5JOHN 5
27
3 Crowds of sick people––blind, lame,
or paralyzed––lay on the porches.
4 [[EMPTY]]
5 One of the men lying there had been
sick for thirty–eight years.
6 When Jesus saw him and knew how
long he had been ill, he asked him,
"Would you like to get well?"
7 "I can’t, sir," the sick man said, "for I
have no one to help me into the pool
when the water is s rred up. While I am
trying to get there, someone else always
gets in ahead of me."
8 Jesus told him, "Stand up, pick up your
sleeping mat, and walk!"
9 Instantly, the man was healed! He
rolled up the mat and began walking! But
this miracle happened on the Sabbath
day.
10 So the Jewish leaders objected. They
said to the man who was cured, "YouJOHN 5
28
can’t work on the Sabbath! It’s illegal to
carry that sleeping mat!"
11 He replied, "The man who healed me
said to me, ‘Pick up your sleeping mat
and walk.’"
12 "Who said such a thing as that?" they
demanded.
13 The man didn’t know, for Jesus had
disappeared into the crowd.
14 But a erward Jesus found him in
the Temple and told him, "Now you are
well; so stop sinning, or something even
worse may happen to you."
15 Then the man went to ﬁnd the Jewish
leaders and told them it was Jesus who
had healed him.
16 So the Jewish leaders began
harassing Jesus for breaking the Sabbath
rules.
17 But Jesus replied, "My Father never
stops working, so why should I?"JOHN 5
29
18 So the Jewish leaders tried all
the more to kill him. In addi on to
disobeying the Sabbath rules, he had
spoken of God as his Father, thereby
making himself equal with God.
19 Jesus replied, "I assure you, the Son
can do nothing by himself. He does only
what he sees the Father doing. Whatever
the Father does, the Son also does.
20 For the Father loves the Son and tells
him everything he is doing, and the Son
will do far greater things than healing
this man. You will be astonished at what
he does.
21 He will even raise from the dead
anyone he wants to, just as the Father
does.
22 And the Father leaves all judgment to
his Son,
23 so that everyone will honor the Son,
just as they honor the Father. But if you
refuse to honor the Son, then you areJOHN 5
30
certainly not honoring the Father who
sent him.
24 "I assure you, those who listen to my
message and believe in God who sent
me have eternal life. They will never be
condemned for their sins, but they have
already passed from death into life.
25 "And I assure you that the me is
coming, in fact it is here, when the dead
will hear my voice––the voice of the Son
of God. And those who listen will live.
26 The Father has life in himself, and
he has granted his Son to have life in
himself.
27 And he has given him authority to
judge all mankind because he is the Son
of Man.
28 Don’t be so surprised! Indeed, the
me is coming when all the dead in their
graves will hear the voice of God’s Son,
29 and they will rise again. Those who
have done good will rise to eternal life,JOHN 5
31
and those who have con nued in evil
will rise to judgment.
30 But I do nothing without consul ng
the Father. I judge as I am told. And my
judgment is absolutely just, because it
is according to the will of God who sent
me; it is not merely my own.
31 "If I were to tes fy on my own behalf,
my tes mony would not be valid.
32 But someone else is also tes fying
about me, and I can assure you that
everything he says about me is true.
33 In fact, you sent messengers to listen
to John the Bap st, and he preached the
truth.
34 But the best tes mony about me is
not from a man, though I have reminded
you about John’s tes mony so you might
be saved.
35 John shone brightly for a while, and
you beneﬁted and rejoiced.JOHN 5
32
36 But I have a greater witness than
John––my teachings and my miracles.
They have been assigned to me by the
Father, and they tes fy that the Father
has sent me.
37 And the Father himself has also
tes ﬁed about me. You have never heard
his voice or seen him face to face,
38 and you do not have his message in
your hearts, because you do not believe
me––the one he sent to you.
39 "You search the Scriptures because
you believe they give you eternal life.
But the Scriptures point to me!
40 Yet you refuse to come to me so that
I can give you this eternal life.
41 "Your approval or disapproval means
nothing to me,
42 because I know you don’t have God’s
love within you.
43 For I have come to you represen ng
my Father, and you refuse to welcomeJOHN 5 – 6
33
me, even though you readily accept
others who represent only themselves.
44 No wonder you can’t believe! For you
gladly honor each other, but you don’t
care about the honor that comes from
God alone.
45 "Yet it is not I who will accuse you of
this before the Father. Moses will accuse
you! Yes, Moses, on whom you set your
hopes.
46 But if you had believed Moses, you
would have believed me because he
wrote about me.
47 And since you don’t believe what he
wrote, how will you believe what I say?"
1 A er this, Jesus crossed over the
Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea
of Tiberias.
2 And a huge crowd kept following him
wherever he went, because they saw his
miracles as he healed the sick.
6JOHN 6
34
3 Then Jesus went up into the hills and
sat down with his disciples around him.
4 (It was nearly me for the annual
Passover celebra on.)
5 Jesus soon saw a great crowd of
people climbing the hill, looking for
him. Turning to Philip, he asked, "Philip,
where can we buy bread to feed all these
people?"
6 He was tes ng Philip, for he already
knew what he was going to do.
7 Philip replied, "It would take a small
fortune to feed them!"
8 Then Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother,
spoke up.
9 "There’s a young boy here with ﬁve
barley loaves and two ﬁsh. But what
good is that with this huge crowd?"
10 "Tell everyone to sit down," Jesus
ordered. So all of them––the men alone
numbered ﬁve thousand––sat down on
the grassy slopes.JOHN 6
35
11 Then Jesus took the loaves, gave
thanks to God, and passed them out to
the people. A erward he did the same
with the ﬁsh. And they all ate un l they
were full.
12 "Now gather the le overs," Jesus
told his disciples, "so that nothing is
wasted."
13 There were only ﬁve barley loaves to
start with, but twelve baskets were ﬁlled
with the pieces of bread the people did
not eat!
14 When the people saw this miraculous
sign, they exclaimed, "Surely, he is the
Prophet we have been expec ng!"
15 Jesus saw that they were ready to
take him by force and make him king, so
he went higher into the hills alone.
16 That evening his disciples went down
to the shore to wait for him.
17 But as darkness fell and Jesus s ll
hadn’t come back, they got into the boatJOHN 6
36
and headed out across the lake toward
Capernaum.
18 Soon a gale swept down upon them
as they rowed, and the sea grew very
rough.
19 They were three or four miles out
when suddenly they saw Jesus walking
on the water toward the boat. They
were terriﬁed,
20 but he called out to them, "I am
here! Don’t be afraid."
21 Then they were eager to let him in,
and immediately the boat arrived at
their des na on!
22 The next morning, back across the
lake, crowds began gathering on the
shore, wai ng to see Jesus. For they
knew that he and his disciples had come
over together and that the disciples
had gone oﬀ in their boat, leaving him
behind.JOHN 6
37
23 Several boats from Tiberias landed
near the place where the Lord had
blessed the bread and the people had
eaten.
24 When the crowd saw that Jesus
wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they
got into the boats and went across to
Capernaum to look for him.
25 When they arrived and found him,
they asked, "Teacher, how did you get
here?"
26 Jesus replied, "The truth is, you want
to be with me because I fed you, not
because you saw the miraculous sign.
27 But you shouldn’t be so concerned
about perishable things like food. Spend
your energy seeking the eternal life that
I, the Son of Man, can give you. For God
the Father has sent me for that very
purpose."
28 They replied, "What does God want
us to do?"JOHN 6
38
29 Jesus told them, "This is what God
wants you to do: Believe in the one he
has sent."
30 They replied, "You must show us a
miraculous sign if you want us to believe
in you. What will you do for us?
31 A er all, our ancestors ate manna
while they journeyed through the
wilderness! As the Scriptures say, ‘Moses
gave them bread from heaven to eat.’"
32 Jesus said, "I assure you, Moses
didn’t give them bread from heaven. My
Father did. And now he oﬀers you the
true bread from heaven.
33 The true bread of God is the one who
comes down from heaven and gives life
to the world."
34 "Sir," they said, "give us that bread
every day of our lives."
35 Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life.
No one who comes to me will ever beJOHN 6
39
hungry again. Those who believe in me
will never thirst.
36 But you haven’t believed in me even
though you have seen me.
37 However, those the Father has given
me will come to me, and I will never
reject them.
38 For I have come down from heaven
to do the will of God who sent me, not
to do what I want.
39 And this is the will of God, that I
should not lose even one of all those
he has given me, but that I should raise
them to eternal life at the last day.
40 For it is my Father’s will that all who
see his Son and believe in him should
have eternal life––that I should raise
them at the last day."
41 Then the people began to murmur
in disagreement because he had said, "I
am the bread from heaven."JOHN 6
40
42 They said, "This is Jesus, the son of
Joseph. We know his father and mother.
How can he say, ‘I came down from
heaven’?"
43 But Jesus replied, "Don’t complain
about what I said.
44 For people can’t come to me unless
the Father who sent me draws them to
me, and at the last day I will raise them
from the dead.
45 As it is wri en in the Scriptures, ‘They
will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who
hears and learns from the Father comes
to me.
46 (Not that anyone has ever seen the
Father; only I, who was sent from God,
have seen him.)
47 "I assure you, anyone who believes in
me already has eternal life.
48 Yes, I am the bread of life!
49 Your ancestors ate manna in the
wilderness, but they all died.JOHN 6
41
50 However, the bread from heaven
gives eternal life to everyone who eats
it.
51 I am the living bread that came down
out of heaven. Anyone who eats this
bread will live forever; this bread is my
ﬂesh, oﬀered so the world may live."
52 Then the people began arguing with
each other about what he meant. "How
can this man give us his ﬂesh to eat?"
they asked.
53 So Jesus said again, "I assure you,
unless you eat the ﬂesh of the Son of
Man and drink his blood, you cannot
have eternal life within you.
54 But those who eat my ﬂesh and drink
my blood have eternal life, and I will
raise them at the last day.
55 For my ﬂesh is the true food, and my
blood is the true drink.
56 All who eat my ﬂesh and drink my
blood remain in me, and I in them.JOHN 6
42
57 I live by the power of the living Father
who sent me; in the same way, those
who partake of me will live because of
me.
58 I am the true bread from heaven.
Anyone who eats this bread will live
forever and not die as your ancestors
did, even though they ate the manna."
59 He said these things while he was
teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
60 Even his disciples said, "This is very
hard to understand. How can anyone
accept it?"
61 Jesus knew within himself that his
disciples were complaining, so he said to
them, "Does this oﬀend you?
62 Then what will you think if you see
me, the Son of Man, return to heaven
again?
63 It is the Spirit who gives eternal life.
Human eﬀort accomplishes nothing. AndJOHN 6
43
the very words I have spoken to you are
spirit and life.
64 But some of you don’t believe me."
(For Jesus knew from the beginning who
didn’t believe, and he knew who would
betray him.)
65 Then he said, "That is what I meant
when I said that people can’t come to
me unless the Father brings them to
me."
66 At this point many of his disciples
turned away and deserted him.
67 Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and
asked, "Are you going to leave, too?"
68 Simon Peter replied, "Lord, to whom
would we go? You alone have the words
that give eternal life.
69 We believe them, and we know you
are the Holy One of God."
70 Then Jesus said, "I chose the twelve
of you, but one is a devil."JOHN 6 – 7
44
71 He was speaking of Judas, son of
Simon Iscariot, one of the Twelve, who
would betray him.
1 A er this, Jesus stayed in Galilee,
going from village to village. He
wanted to stay out of Judea where the
Jewish leaders were plo ng his death.
2 But soon it was me for the Fes val of
Shelters,
3 and Jesus’ brothers urged him to go
to Judea for the celebra on. "Go where
your followers can see your miracles!"
they scoﬀed.
4 "You can’t become a public ﬁgure if
you hide like this! If you can do such
wonderful things, prove it to the world!"
5 For even his brothers didn’t believe in
him.
6 Jesus replied, "Now is not the right
me for me to go. But you can go
any me, and it will make no diﬀerence.
7JOHN 7
45
7 The world can’t hate you, but it does
hate me because I accuse it of sin and
evil.
8 You go on. I am not yet ready to go to
this fes val, because my me has not
yet come."
9 So Jesus remained in Galilee.
10 But a er his brothers had le for the
fes val, Jesus also went, though secretly,
staying out of public view.
11 The Jewish leaders tried to ﬁnd him
at the fes val and kept asking if anyone
had seen him.
12 There was a lot of discussion about
him among the crowds. Some said, "He’s
a wonderful man," while others said,
"He’s nothing but a fraud, deceiving the
people."
13 But no one had the courage to speak
favorably about him in public, for they
were afraid of ge ng in trouble with the
Jewish leaders.JOHN 7
14 Then, midway through the fes
46
val,
Jesus went up to the Temple and began
to teach.
15 The Jewish leaders were surprised
when they heard him. "How does he
know so much when he hasn’t studied
everything we’ve studied?" they asked.
16 So Jesus told them, "I’m not teaching
my own ideas, but those of God who
sent me.
17 Anyone who wants to do the will of
God will know whether my teaching is
from God or is merely my own.
18 Those who present their own ideas
are looking for praise for themselves,
but those who seek to honor the one
who sent them are good and genuine.
19 None of you obeys the law of Moses!
In fact, you are trying to kill me."
20 The crowd replied, "You’re demon
possessed! Who’s trying to kill you?"JOHN 7
47
21 Jesus replied, "I worked on the
Sabbath by healing a man, and you were
oﬀended.
22 But you work on the Sabbath,
too, when you obey Moses’ law of
circumcision. (Actually, this tradi on of
circumcision is older than the law of
Moses; it goes back to Abraham.)
23 For if the correct me for circumcising
your son falls on the Sabbath, you go
ahead and do it, so as not to break
the law of Moses. So why should I
be condemned for making a man
completely well on the Sabbath?
24 Think this through and you will see
that I am right."
25 Some of the people who lived there
in Jerusalem said among themselves,
"Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?
26 But here he is, speaking in public,
and they say nothing to him. Can it beJOHN 7
48
that our leaders know that he really is
the Messiah?
27 But how could he be? For we know
where this man comes from. When the
Messiah comes, he will simply appear;
no one will know where he comes from."
28 While Jesus was teaching in the
Temple, he called out, "Yes, you know
me, and you know where I come from.
But I represent one you don’t know, and
he is true.
29 I know him because I have come
from him, and he sent me to you."
30 Then the leaders tried to arrest him;
but no one laid a hand on him, because
his me had not yet come.
31 Many among the crowds at the
Temple believed in him. "A er all," they
said, "would you expect the Messiah to
do more miraculous signs than this man
has done?"JOHN 7
49
32 When the Pharisees heard that the
crowds were murmuring such things,
they and the leading priests sent Temple
guards to arrest Jesus.
33 But Jesus told them, "I will be here a
li le longer. Then I will return to the one
who sent me.
34 You will search for me but not ﬁnd
me. And you won’t be able to come
where I am."
35 The Jewish leaders were puzzled by
this statement. "Where is he planning to
go?" they asked. "Maybe he is thinking
of leaving the country and going to the
Jews in other lands, or maybe even to
the Gen les!
36 What does he mean when he says,
‘You will search for me but not ﬁnd me,’
and ‘You won’t be able to come where I
am’?"JOHN 7
50
37 On the last day, the climax of the
fes val, Jesus stood and shouted to the
crowds, "If you are thirsty, come to me!
38 If you believe in me, come and drink!
For the Scriptures declare that rivers of
living water will ﬂow out from within."
39 (When he said "living water," he
was speaking of the Spirit, who would
be given to everyone believing in him.
But the Spirit had not yet been given,
because Jesus had not yet entered into
his glory.)
40 When the crowds heard him say this,
some of them declared, "This man surely
is the Prophet."
41 Others said, "He is the Messiah." S ll
others said, "But he can’t be! Will the
Messiah come from Galilee?
42 For the Scriptures clearly state that
the Messiah will be born of the royal
line of David, in Bethlehem, the village
where King David was born."JOHN 7
51
43 So the crowd was divided in their
opinion about him.
44 And some wanted him arrested, but
no one touched him.
45 The Temple guards who had been
sent to arrest him returned to the leading
priests and Pharisees. "Why didn’t you
bring him in?" they demanded.
46 "We have never heard anyone talk
like this!" the guards responded.
47 "Have you been led astray, too?" the
Pharisees mocked.
48 "Is there a single one of us rulers or
Pharisees who believes in him?
49 These ignorant crowds do, but what
do they know about it? A curse on them
anyway!"
50 Nicodemus, the leader who had met
with Jesus earlier, then spoke up.
51 "Is it legal to convict a man before he
is given a hearing?" he asked.JOHN 7 – 8
52
52 They replied, "Are you from Galilee,
too? Search the Scriptures and see for
yourself––no prophet ever comes from
Galilee!"
53 Then the mee ng broke up and
everybody went home.
1 Jesus returned to the Mount of
Olives,
2 but early the next morning he was
back again at the Temple. A crowd soon
gathered, and he sat down and taught
them.
3 As he was speaking, the teachers of
religious law and Pharisees brought a
woman they had caught in the act of
adultery. They put her in front of the
crowd.
4 "Teacher," they said to Jesus, "this
woman was caught in the very act of
adultery.
5 The law of Moses says to stone her.
What do you say?"
8JOHN 8
53
6 They were trying to trap him into
saying something they could use against
him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote
in the dust with his ﬁnger.
7 They kept demanding an answer, so
he stood up again and said, "All right,
stone her. But let those who have never
sinned throw the ﬁrst stones!"
8 Then he stooped down again and
wrote in the dust.
9 When the accusers heard this, they
slipped away one by one, beginning with
the oldest, un l only Jesus was le in the
middle of the crowd with the woman.
10 Then Jesus stood up again and said
to her, "Where are your accusers? Didn’t
even one of them condemn you?"
11 "No, Lord," she said. And Jesus said,
"Neither do I. Go and sin no more."
12 Jesus said to the people, "I am the
light of the world. If you follow me,
you won’t be stumbling through theJOHN 8
54
darkness, because you will have the light
that leads to life."
13 The Pharisees replied, "You are
making false claims about yourself!"
14 Jesus told them, "These claims are
valid even though I make them about
myself. For I know where I came from
and where I am going, but you don’t
know this about me.
15 You judge me with all your human
limita ons, but I am not judging anyone.
16 And if I did, my judgment would be
correct in every respect because I am
not alone––I have with me the Father
who sent me.
17 Your own law says that if two people
agree about something, their witness is
accepted as fact.
18 I am one witness, and my Father who
sent me is the other."
19 "Where is your father?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "Since you don’t knowJOHN 8
55
who I am, you don’t know who my
Father is. If you knew me, then you
would know my Father, too."
20 Jesus made these statements while
he was teaching in the sec on of the
Temple known as the Treasury. But he
was not arrested, because his me had
not yet come.
21 Later Jesus said to them again, "I am
going away. You will search for me and
die in your sin. You cannot come where I
am going."
22 The Jewish leaders asked, "Is he
planning to commit suicide? What does
he mean, ‘You cannot come where I am
going’?"
23 Then he said to them, "You are from
below; I am from above. You are of this
world; I am not.
24 That is why I said that you will die in
your sins; for unless you believe that IJOHN 8
56
am who I say I am, you will die in your
sins."
25 "Tell us who you are," they
demanded. Jesus replied, "I am the one I
have always claimed to be.
26 I have much to say about you and
much to condemn, but I won’t. For I say
only what I have heard from the one
who sent me, and he is true."
27 But they s ll didn’t understand that
he was talking to them about his Father.
28 So Jesus said, "When you have li ed
up the Son of Man on the cross, then
you will realize that I am he and that I
do nothing on my own, but I speak what
the Father taught me.
29 And the one who sent me is with
me––he has not deserted me. For I
always do those things that are pleasing
to him."
30 Then many who heard him say these
things believed in him.JOHN 8
57
31 Jesus said to the people who believed
in him, "You are truly my disciples if you
keep obeying my teachings.
32 And you will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free."
33 "But we are descendants of
Abraham," they said. "We have never
been slaves to anyone on earth. What
do you mean, ‘set free’?"
34 Jesus replied, "I assure you that
everyone who sins is a slave of sin.
35 A slave is not a permanent member
of the family, but a son is part of the
family forever.
36 So if the Son sets you free, you will
indeed be free.
37 Yes, I realize that you are descendants
of Abraham. And yet some of you are
trying to kill me because my message
does not ﬁnd a place in your hearts.JOHN 8
58
38 I am telling you what I saw when
I was with my Father. But you are
following the advice of your father."
39 "Our father is Abraham," they
declared. "No," Jesus replied, "for if you
were children of Abraham, you would
follow his good example.
40 I told you the truth I heard from God,
but you are trying to kill me. Abraham
wouldn’t do a thing like that.
41 No, you are obeying your real father
when you act that way." They replied,
"We were not born out of wedlock! Our
true Father is God himself."
42 Jesus told them, "If God were your
Father, you would love me, because I
have come to you from God. I am not
here on my own, but he sent me.
43 Why can’t you understand what I am
saying? It is because you are unable to
do so!JOHN 8
59
44 For you are the children of your
father the Devil, and you love to do the
evil things he does. He was a murderer
from the beginning and has always hated
the truth. There is no truth in him. When
he lies, it is consistent with his character;
for he is a liar and the father of lies.
45 So when I tell the truth, you just
naturally don’t believe me!
46 Which of you can truthfully accuse
me of sin? And since I am telling you the
truth, why don’t you believe me?
47 Anyone whose Father is God listens
gladly to the words of God. Since
you don’t, it proves you aren’t God’s
children."
48 The people retorted, "You Samaritan
devil! Didn’t we say all along that you
were possessed by a demon?"
49 "No," Jesus said, "I have no demon
in me. For I honor my Father––and you
dishonor me.JOHN 8
60
50 And though I have no wish to glorify
myself, God wants to glorify me. Let him
be the judge.
51 I assure you, anyone who obeys my
teaching will never die!"
52 The people said, "Now we know
you are possessed by a demon. Even
Abraham and the prophets died, but you
say that those who obey your teaching
will never die!
53 Are you greater than our father
Abraham, who died? Are you greater
than the prophets, who died? Who do
you think you are?"
54 Jesus answered, "If I am merely
boas ng about myself, it doesn’t count.
But it is my Father who says these
glorious things about me. You say, ‘He is
our God,’
55 but you do not even know him. I
know him. If I said otherwise, I would beJOHN 8 – 9
61
as great a liar as you! But it is true––I
know him and obey him.
56 Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced as
he looked forward to my coming. He saw
it and was glad."
57 The people said, "You aren’t even
ﬁ y years old. How can you say you have
seen Abraham?"
58 Jesus answered, "The truth is, I
existed before Abraham was even born!"
59 At that point they picked up stones
to kill him. But Jesus hid himself from
them and le the Temple.
1 As Jesus was walking along, he
saw a man who had been blind from
birth.
2 "Teacher," his disciples asked him,
"why was this man born blind? Was it
a result of his own sins or those of his
parents?"
3 "It was not because of his sins or his
parents’ sins," Jesus answered. "He was
9JOHN 9
62
born blind so the power of God could be
seen in him.
4 All of us must quickly carry out the
tasks assigned us by the one who sent
me, because there is li le me le
before the night falls and all work comes
to an end.
5 But while I am s ll here in the world, I
am the light of the world."
6 Then he spit on the ground, made
mud with the saliva, and smoothed the
mud over the blind man’s eyes.
7 He told him, "Go and wash in the pool
of Siloam" (Siloam means Sent). So the
man went and washed, and came back
seeing!
8 His neighbors and others who knew
him as a blind beggar asked each other,
"Is this the same man––that beggar?"
9 Some said he was, and others said,
"No, but he surely looks like him!" AndJOHN 9
63
the beggar kept saying, "I am the same
man!"
10 They asked, "Who healed you? What
happened?"
11 He told them, "The man they call
Jesus made mud and smoothed it over
my eyes and told me, ‘Go to the pool of
Siloam and wash oﬀ the mud.’ I went
and washed, and now I can see!"
12 "Where is he now?" they asked. "I
don’t know," he replied.
13 Then they took the man to the
Pharisees.
14 Now as it happened, Jesus had
healed the man on a Sabbath.
15 The Pharisees asked the man all
about it. So he told them, "He smoothed
the mud over my eyes, and when it was
washed away, I could see!"
16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This
man Jesus is not from God, for he is
working on the Sabbath." Others said,JOHN 9
64
"But how could an ordinary sinner do
such miraculous signs?" So there was a
deep division of opinion among them.
17 Then the Pharisees once again
ques oned the man who had been blind
and demanded, "This man who opened
your eyes––who do you say he is?"
The man replied, "I think he must be a
prophet."
18 The Jewish leaders wouldn’t believe
he had been blind, so they called in his
parents.
19 They asked them, "Is this your son?
Was he born blind? If so, how can he
see?"
20 His parents replied, "We know this is
our son and that he was born blind,
21 but we don’t know how he can see
or who healed him. He is old enough to
speak for himself. Ask him."
22 They said this because they were
afraid of the Jewish leaders, who hadJOHN 9
65
announced that anyone saying Jesus was
the Messiah would be expelled from the
synagogue.
23 That’s why they said, "He is old
enough to speak for himself. Ask him."
24 So for the second me they called
in the man who had been blind and
told him, "Give glory to God by telling
the truth, because we know Jesus is a
sinner."
25 "I don’t know whether he is a sinner,"
the man replied. "But I know this: I was
blind, and now I can see!"
26 "But what did he do?" they asked.
"How did he heal you?"
27 "Look!" the man exclaimed. "I told
you once. Didn’t you listen? Why do you
want to hear it again? Do you want to
become his disciples, too?"
28 Then they cursed him and said, "You
are his disciple, but we are disciples of
Moses.JOHN 9
66
29 We know God spoke to Moses, but
as for this man, we don’t know anything
about him."
30 "Why, that’s very strange!" the man
replied. "He healed my eyes, and yet you
don’t know anything about him!
31 Well, God doesn’t listen to sinners,
but he is ready to hear those who
worship him and do his will.
32 Never since the world began has
anyone been able to open the eyes of
someone born blind.
33 If this man were not from God, he
couldn’t do it."
34 "You were born in sin!" they
answered. "Are you trying to teach
us?" And they threw him out of the
synagogue.
35 When Jesus heard what had
happened, he found the man and said,
"Do you believe in the Son of Man?"JOHN 9 – 10
67
36 The man answered, "Who is he, sir,
because I would like to."
37 "You have seen him," Jesus said, "and
he is speaking to you!"
38 "Yes, Lord," the man said, "I believe!"
And he worshiped Jesus.
39 Then Jesus told him, "I have come
to judge the world. I have come to give
sight to the blind and to show those who
think they see that they are blind."
40 The Pharisees who were standing
there heard him and asked, "Are you
saying we are blind?"
41 "If you were blind, you wouldn’t be
guilty," Jesus replied. "But you remain
guilty because you claim you can see.
1 "I assure you, anyone who
sneaks over the wall of a
sheepfold, rather than going through
the gate, must surely be a thief and a
robber!
10JOHN 10
68
2 For a shepherd enters through the
gate.
3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for
him, and the sheep hear his voice and
come to him. He calls his own sheep by
name and leads them out.
4 A er he has gathered his own ﬂock,
he walks ahead of them, and they follow
him because they recognize his voice.
5 They won’t follow a stranger; they
will run from him because they don’t
recognize his voice."
6 Those who heard Jesus use this
illustra on didn’t understand what he
meant,
7 so he explained it to them. "I assure
you, I am the gate for the sheep," he
said.
8 "All others who came before me were
thieves and robbers. But the true sheep
did not listen to them.JOHN 10
69
9 Yes, I am the gate. Those who come
in through me will be saved. Wherever
they go, they will ﬁnd green pastures.
10 The thief’s purpose is to steal and kill
and destroy. My purpose is to give life in
all its fullness.
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep.
12 A hired hand will run when he sees
a wolf coming. He will leave the sheep
because they aren’t his and he isn’t their
shepherd. And so the wolf a acks them
and sca ers the ﬂock.
13 The hired hand runs away because he
is merely hired and has no real concern
for the sheep.
14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my
own sheep, and they know me,
15 just as my Father knows me and I
know the Father. And I lay down my life
for the sheep.JOHN 10
70
16 I have other sheep, too, that are not
in this sheepfold. I must bring them
also, and they will listen to my voice;
and there will be one ﬂock with one
shepherd.
17 "The Father loves me because I lay
down my life that I may have it back
again.
18 No one can take my life from me. I
lay down my life voluntarily. For I have
the right to lay it down when I want to
and also the power to take it again. For
my Father has given me this command."
19 When he said these things, the
people were again divided in their
opinions about him.
20 Some of them said, "He has a demon,
or he’s crazy. Why listen to a man like
that?"
21 Others said, "This doesn’t sound like
a man possessed by a demon! Can a
demon open the eyes of the blind?"JOHN 10
71
22 It was now winter, and Jesus was in
Jerusalem at the me of Hanukkah.
23 He was at the Temple, walking
through the sec on known as Solomon’s
Colonnade.
24 The Jewish leaders surrounded him
and asked, "How long are you going
to keep us in suspense? If you are the
Messiah, tell us plainly."
25 Jesus replied, "I have already told
you, and you don’t believe me. The proof
is what I do in the name of my Father.
26 But you don’t believe me because
you are not part of my ﬂock.
27 My sheep recognize my voice; I know
them, and they follow me.
28 I give them eternal life, and they will
never perish. No one will snatch them
away from me,
29 for my Father has given them to me,
and he is more powerful than anyone
else. So no one can take them from me.JOHN 10
72
30 The Father and I are one."
31 Once again the Jewish leaders picked
up stones to kill him.
32 Jesus said, "At my Father’s direc on
I have done many things to help the
people. For which one of these good
deeds are you killing me?"
33 They replied, "Not for any good work,
but for blasphemy, because you, a mere
man, have made yourself God."
34 Jesus replied, "It is wri en in your
own law that God said to certain leaders
of the people, ‘I say, you are gods!’
35 And you know that the Scriptures
cannot be altered. So if those people,
who received God’s message, were
called ‘gods,’
36 why do you call it blasphemy when
the Holy One who was sent into the
world by the Father says, ‘I am the Son
of God’?JOHN 10 – 11
73
37 Don’t believe me unless I carry out
my Father’s work.
38 But if I do his work, believe in what I
have done, even if you don’t believe me.
Then you will realize that the Father is in
me, and I am in the Father."
39 Once again they tried to arrest him,
but he got away and le them.
40 He went beyond the Jordan River to
stay near the place where John was ﬁrst
bap zing.
41 And many followed him. "John didn’t
do miracles," they remarked to one
another, "but all his predic ons about
this man have come true."
42 And many believed in him there.
1 A man named Lazarus was
sick. He lived in Bethany with his
sisters, Mary and Martha.
2 This is the Mary who poured the
expensive perfume on the Lord’s feet
11JOHN 11
74
and wiped them with her hair. Her
brother, Lazarus, was sick.
3 So the two sisters sent a message to
Jesus telling him, "Lord, the one you love
is very sick."
4 But when Jesus heard about it he said,
"Lazarus’s sickness will not end in death.
No, it is for the glory of God. I, the Son of
God, will receive glory from this."
5 Although Jesus loved Martha, Mary,
and Lazarus,
6 he stayed where he was for the next
two days and did not go to them.
7 Finally a er two days, he said to his
disciples, "Let’s go to Judea again."
8 But his disciples objected. "Teacher,"
they said, "only a few days ago the
Jewish leaders in Judea were trying to
kill you. Are you going there again?"
9 Jesus replied, "There are twelve hours
of daylight every day. As long as it is
light, people can walk safely. They canJOHN 11
75
see because they have the light of this
world.
10 Only at night is there danger of
stumbling because there is no light."
11 Then he said, "Our friend Lazarus has
fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake
him up."
12 The disciples said, "Lord, if he is
sleeping, that means he is ge ng
be er!"
13 They thought Jesus meant Lazarus
was having a good night’s rest, but Jesus
meant Lazarus had died.
14 Then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is
dead.
15 And for your sake, I am glad I wasn’t
there, because this will give you another
opportunity to believe in me. Come, let’s
go see him."
16 Thomas, nicknamed the Twin, said to
his fellow disciples, "Let’s go, too––and
die with Jesus."JOHN 11
76
17 When Jesus arrived at Bethany, he
was told that Lazarus had already been
in his grave for four days.
18 Bethany was only a few miles down
the road from Jerusalem,
19 and many of the people had come to
pay their respects and console Martha
and Mary on their loss.
20 When Martha got word that Jesus
was coming, she went to meet him. But
Mary stayed at home.
21 Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you
had been here, my brother would not
have died.
22 But even now I know that God will
give you whatever you ask."
23 Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise
again."
24 "Yes," Martha said, "when everyone
else rises, on resurrec on day."
25 Jesus told her, "I am the resurrec on
and the life. Those who believe in me,JOHN 11
77
even though they die like everyone else,
will live again.
26 They are given eternal life for
believing in me and will never perish. Do
you believe this, Martha?"
27 "Yes, Lord," she told him. "I have
always believed you are the Messiah,
the Son of God, the one who has come
into the world from God."
28 Then she le him and returned to
Mary. She called Mary aside from the
mourners and told her, "The Teacher is
here and wants to see you."
29 So Mary immediately went to him.
30 Now Jesus had stayed outside the
village, at the place where Martha met
him.
31 When the people who were at the
house trying to console Mary saw her
leave so has ly, they assumed she was
going to Lazarus’s grave to weep. So they
followed her there.JOHN 11
78
32 When Mary arrived and saw Jesus,
she fell down at his feet and said, "Lord,
if you had been here, my brother would
not have died."
33 When Jesus saw her weeping and
saw the other people wailing with her,
he was moved with indigna on and was
deeply troubled.
34 "Where have you put him?" he asked
them. They told him, "Lord, come and
see."
35 Then Jesus wept.
36 The people who were standing
nearby said, "See how much he loved
him."
37 But some said, "This man healed a
blind man. Why couldn’t he keep Lazarus
from dying?"
38 And again Jesus was deeply troubled.
Then they came to the grave. It was
a cave with a stone rolled across its
entrance.JOHN 11
79
39 "Roll the stone aside," Jesus told
them. But Martha, the dead man’s sister,
said, "Lord, by now the smell will be
terrible because he has been dead for
four days."
40 Jesus responded, "Didn’t I tell you
that you will see God’s glory if you
believe?"
41 So they rolled the stone aside. Then
Jesus looked up to heaven and said,
"Father, thank you for hearing me.
42 You always hear me, but I said it out
loud for the sake of all these people
standing here, so they will believe you
sent me."
43 Then Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come
out!"
44 And Lazarus came out, bound in
graveclothes, his face wrapped in a
headcloth. Jesus told them, "Unwrap
him and let him go!"JOHN 11
80
45 Many of the people who were with
Mary believed in Jesus when they saw
this happen.
46 But some went to the Pharisees and
told them what Jesus had done.
47 Then the leading priests and
Pharisees called the high council
together to discuss the situa on. "What
are we going to do?" they asked each
other. "This man certainly performs
many miraculous signs.
48 If we leave him alone, the whole
na on will follow him, and then the
Roman army will come and destroy both
our Temple and our na on."
49 And one of them, Caiaphas, who was
high priest that year, said, "How can you
be so stupid?
50 Why should the whole na on be
destroyed? Let this one man die for the
people."JOHN 11
81
51 This prophecy that Jesus should die
for the en re na on came from Caiaphas
in his posi on as high priest. He didn’t
think of it himself; he was inspired to say
it.
52 It was a predic on that Jesus’ death
would be not for Israel only, but for the
gathering together of all the children of
God sca ered around the world.
53 So from that me on the Jewish
leaders began to plot Jesus’ death.
54 As a result, Jesus stopped his public
ministry among the people and le
Jerusalem. He went to a place near the
wilderness, to the village of Ephraim,
and stayed there with his disciples.
55 It was now almost me for the
celebra on of Passover, and many
people from the country arrived in
Jerusalem several days early so they
could go through the cleansing ceremony
before the Passover began.JOHN 11 – 12
82
56 They wanted to see Jesus, and as
they talked in the Temple, they asked
each other, "What do you think? Will he
come for the Passover?"
57 Meanwhile, the leading priests and
Pharisees had publicly announced that
anyone seeing Jesus must report him
immediately so they could arrest him.
1 Six days before the Passover
ceremonies began, Jesus arrived
in Bethany, the home of Lazarus––the
man he had raised from the dead.
2 A dinner was prepared in Jesus’ honor.
Martha served, and Lazarus sat at the
table with him.
3 Then Mary took a twelve–ounce jar of
expensive perfume made from essence
of nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet
with it and wiped his feet with her hair.
And the house was ﬁlled with fragrance.
12JOHN 12
83
4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his
disciples––the one who would betray
him––said,
5 "That perfume was worth a small
fortune. It should have been sold and
the money given to the poor."
6 Not that he cared for the poor––he
was a thief who was in charge of the
disciples’ funds, and he o en took some
for his own use.
7 Jesus replied, "Leave her alone. She
did it in prepara on for my burial.
8 You will always have the poor among
you, but I will not be here with you much
longer."
9 When all the people heard of Jesus’
arrival, they ﬂocked to see him and also
to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised
from the dead.
10 Then the leading priests decided to
kill Lazarus, too,JOHN 12
84
11 for it was because of him that many
of the people had deserted them and
believed in Jesus.
12 The next day, the news that Jesus was
on the way to Jerusalem swept through
the city. A huge crowd of Passover
visitors
13 took palm branches and went down
the road to meet him. They shouted,
"Praise God! Bless the one who comes in
the name of the Lord! Hail to the King of
Israel!"
14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat
on it, fulﬁlling the prophecy that said:
15 "Don’t be afraid, people of Israel.
Look, your King is coming, si ng on a
donkey’s colt."
16 His disciples didn’t realize at the me
that this was a fulﬁllment of prophecy.
But a er Jesus entered into his glory,
they remembered that these Scriptures
had come true before their eyes.JOHN 12
85
17 Those in the crowd who had seen
Jesus call Lazarus back to life were telling
others all about it.
18 That was the main reason so many
went out to meet him––because they
had heard about this mighty miracle.
19 Then the Pharisees said to each
other, "We’ve lost. Look, the whole
world has gone a er him!"
20 Some Greeks who had come to
Jerusalem to a end the Passover
21 paid a visit to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, "Sir, we
want to meet Jesus."
22 Philip told Andrew about it, and they
went together to ask Jesus.
23 Jesus replied, "The me has come for
the Son of Man to enter into his glory.
24 The truth is, a kernel of wheat must
be planted in the soil. Unless it dies it
will be alone––a single seed. But itsJOHN 12
86
death will produce many new kernels––a
plen ful harvest of new lives.
25 Those who love their life in this world
will lose it. Those who despise their life
in this world will keep it for eternal life.
26 All those who want to be my disciples
must come and follow me, because my
servants must be where I am. And if they
follow me, the Father will honor them.
27 Now my soul is deeply troubled.
Should I pray, ‘Father, save me from what
lies ahead’? But that is the very reason
why I came!
28 Father, bring glory to your name."
Then a voice spoke from heaven, saying,
"I have already brought it glory, and I will
do it again."
29 When the crowd heard the voice,
some thought it was thunder, while
others declared an angel had spoken to
him.JOHN 12
87
30 Then Jesus told them, "The voice was
for your beneﬁt, not mine.
31 The me of judgment for the world
has come, when the prince of this world
will be cast out.
32 And when I am li ed up on the cross,
I will draw everyone to myself."
33 He said this to indicate how he was
going to die.
34 "Die?" asked the crowd. "We
understood from Scripture that the
Messiah would live forever. Why are you
saying the Son of Man will die? Who is
this Son of Man you are talking about?"
35 Jesus replied, "My light will shine out
for you just a li le while longer. Walk in
it while you can, so you will not stumble
when the darkness falls. If you walk in
the darkness, you cannot see where you
are going.
36 Believe in the light while there is s ll
me; then you will become childrenJOHN 12
88
of the light." A er saying these things,
Jesus went away and was hidden from
them.
37 But despite all the miraculous signs
he had done, most of the people did not
believe in him.
38 This is exactly what Isaiah the
prophet had predicted: "Lord, who has
believed our message? To whom will the
Lord reveal his saving power?"
39 But the people couldn’t believe, for
as Isaiah also said,
40 "The Lord has blinded their eyes and
hardened their hearts––so their eyes
cannot see, and their hearts cannot
understand, and they cannot turn to me
and let me heal them."
41 Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he
made this predic on, because he was
given a vision of the Messiah’s glory.
42 Many people, including some of the
Jewish leaders, believed in him. But theyJOHN 12
89
wouldn’t admit it to anyone because of
their fear that the Pharisees would expel
them from the synagogue.
43 For they loved human praise more
than the praise of God.
44 Jesus shouted to the crowds, "If you
trust me, you are really trus ng God
who sent me.
45 For when you see me, you are seeing
the one who sent me.
46 I have come as a light to shine in this
dark world, so that all who put their
trust in me will no longer remain in the
darkness.
47 If anyone hears me and doesn’t obey
me, I am not his judge––for I have come
to save the world and not to judge it.
48 But all who reject me and my
message will be judged at the day of
judgment by the truth I have spoken.JOHN 12 – 13
90
49 I don’t speak on my own authority.
The Father who sent me gave me his
own instruc ons as to what I should say.
50 And I know his instruc ons lead to
eternal life; so I say whatever the Father
tells me to say!"
1 Before the Passover celebra on,
Jesus knew that his hour had
come to leave this world and return to
his Father. He now showed the disciples
the full extent of his love.
2 It was me for supper, and the Devil
had already en ced Judas, son of Simon
Iscariot, to carry out his plan to betray
Jesus.
3 Jesus knew that the Father had given
him authority over everything and that
he had come from God and would return
to God.
4 So he got up from the table, took oﬀ
his robe, wrapped a towel around his
waist,
13JOHN 13
91
5 and poured water into a basin. Then
he began to wash the disciples’ feet and
to wipe them with the towel he had
around him.
6 When he came to Simon Peter, Peter
said to him, "Lord, why are you going to
wash my feet?"
7 Jesus replied, "You don’t understand
now why I am doing it; someday you
will."
8 "No," Peter protested, "you will never
wash my feet!" Jesus replied, "But if I
don’t wash you, you won’t belong to
me."
9 Simon Peter exclaimed, "Then wash
my hands and head as well, Lord, not
just my feet!"
10 Jesus replied, "A person who has
bathed all over does not need to wash,
except for the feet, to be en rely clean.
And you are clean, but that isn’t true of
everyone here."JOHN 13
92
11 For Jesus knew who would betray
him. That is what he meant when he
said, "Not all of you are clean."
12 A er washing their feet, he put on
his robe again and sat down and asked,
"Do you understand what I was doing?
13 You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and
you are right, because it is true.
14 And since I, the Lord and Teacher,
have washed your feet, you ought to
wash each other’s feet.
15 I have given you an example to
follow. Do as I have done to you.
16 How true it is that a servant is
not greater than the master. Nor are
messengers more important than the
one who sends them.
17 You know these things––now do
them! That is the path of blessing.
18 "I am not saying these things to all
of you; I know so well each one of you I
chose. The Scriptures declare, ‘The oneJOHN 13
93
who shares my food has turned against
me,’ and this will soon come true.
19 I tell you this now, so that when
it happens you will believe I am the
Messiah.
20 Truly, anyone who welcomes my
messenger is welcoming me, and anyone
who welcomes me is welcoming the
Father who sent me."
21 Now Jesus was in great anguish of
spirit, and he exclaimed, "The truth is,
one of you will betray me!"
22 The disciples looked at each other,
wondering whom he could mean.
23 One of Jesus’ disciples, the one Jesus
loved, was si ng next to Jesus at the
table.
24 Simon Peter mo oned to him to ask
who would do this terrible thing.
25 Leaning toward Jesus, he asked,
"Lord, who is it?"JOHN 13
94
26 Jesus said, "It is the one to whom
I give the bread dipped in the sauce."
And when he had dipped it, he gave it to
Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
27 As soon as Judas had eaten the
bread, Satan entered into him. Then
Jesus told him, "Hurry. Do it now."
28 None of the others at the table knew
what Jesus meant.
29 Since Judas was their treasurer, some
thought Jesus was telling him to go and
pay for the food or to give some money
to the poor.
30 So Judas le at once, going out into
the night.
31 As soon as Judas le the room, Jesus
said, "The me has come for me, the
Son of Man, to enter into my glory, and
God will receive glory because of all that
happens to me.
32 And God will bring me into my glory
very soon.JOHN 13
95
33 Dear children, how brief are these
moments before I must go away and
leave you! Then, though you search for
me, you cannot come to me––just as I
told the Jewish leaders.
34 So now I am giving you a new
commandment: Love each other. Just as
I have loved you, you should love each
other.
35 Your love for one another will prove
to the world that you are my disciples."
36 Simon Peter said, "Lord, where are
you going?" And Jesus replied, "You can’t
go with me now, but you will follow me
later."
37 "But why can’t I come now, Lord?" he
asked. "I am ready to die for you."
38 Jesus answered, "Die for me? No,
before the rooster crows tomorrow
morning, you will deny three mes that
you even know me.JOHN 14
14
96
1 "Don’t be troubled. You trust
God, now trust in me.
2 There are many rooms in my Father’s
home, and I am going to prepare a place
for you. If this were not so, I would tell
you plainly.
3 When everything is ready, I will come
and get you, so that you will always be
with me where I am.
4 And you know where I am going and
how to get there."
5 "No, we don’t know, Lord," Thomas
said. "We haven’t any idea where you
are going, so how can we know the
way?"
6 Jesus told him, "I am the way, the
truth, and the life. No one can come to
the Father except through me.
7 If you had known who I am, then you
would have known who my Father is.
From now on you know him and have
seen him!"JOHN 14
97
8 Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father
and we will be sa sﬁed."
9 Jesus replied, "Philip, don’t you even
yet know who I am, even a er all the
me I have been with you? Anyone who
has seen me has seen the Father! So why
are you asking to see him?
10 Don’t you believe that I am in the
Father and the Father is in me? The
words I say are not my own, but my
Father who lives in me does his work
through me.
11 Just believe that I am in the Father
and the Father is in me. Or at least
believe because of what you have seen
me do.
12 "The truth is, anyone who believes in
me will do the same works I have done,
and even greater works, because I am
going to be with the Father.JOHN 14
98
13 You can ask for anything in my name,
and I will do it, because the work of the
Son brings glory to the Father.
14 Yes, ask anything in my name, and I
will do it!
15 "If you love me, obey my
commandments.
16 And I will ask the Father, and he will
give you another Counselor, who will
never leave you.
17 He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into
all truth. The world at large cannot
receive him, because it isn’t looking for
him and doesn’t recognize him. But you
do, because he lives with you now and
later will be in you.
18 No, I will not abandon you as
orphans––I will come to you.
19 In just a li le while the world will not
see me again, but you will. For I will live
again, and you will, too.JOHN 14
99
20 When I am raised to life again, you
will know that I am in my Father, and you
are in me, and I am in you.
21 Those who obey my commandments
are the ones who love me. And because
they love me, my Father will love them,
and I will love them. And I will reveal
myself to each one of them."
22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the
other disciple with that name) said to
him, "Lord, why are you going to reveal
yourself only to us and not to the world
at large?"
23 Jesus replied, "All those who love me
will do what I say. My Father will love
them, and we will come to them and live
with them.
24 Anyone who doesn’t love me will not
do what I say. And remember, my words
are not my own. This message is from
the Father who sent me.JOHN 14
100
25 I am telling you these things now
while I am s ll with you.
26 But when the Father sends the
Counselor as my representa ve––and by
the Counselor I mean the Holy Spirit––he
will teach you everything and will remind
you of everything I myself have told you.
27 "I am leaving you with a gi ––peace
of mind and heart. And the peace I give
isn’t like the peace the world gives. So
don’t be troubled or afraid.
28 Remember what I told you: I am
going away, but I will come back to you
again. If you really love me, you will be
very happy for me, because now I can go
to the Father, who is greater than I am.
29 I have told you these things before
they happen so that you will believe
when they do happen.
30 "I don’t have much more me to talk
to you, because the prince of this world
approaches. He has no power over me,JOHN 14 – 15
101
31 but I will do what the Father requires
of me, so that the world will know that I
love the Father. Come, let’s be going.
1 "I am the true vine, and my
Father is the gardener.
2 He cuts oﬀ every branch that doesn’t
produce fruit, and he prunes the
branches that do bear fruit so they will
produce even more.
3 You have already been pruned for
greater frui ulness by the message I
have given you.
4 Remain in me, and I will remain in
you. For a branch cannot produce fruit
if it is severed from the vine, and you
cannot be frui ul apart from me.
5 "Yes, I am the vine; you are the
branches. Those who remain in me, and
I in them, will produce much fruit. For
apart from me you can do nothing.
6 Anyone who parts from me is thrown
away like a useless branch and withers.
15JOHN 15
102
Such branches are gathered into a pile to
be burned.
7 But if you stay joined to me and my
words remain in you, you may ask any
request you like, and it will be granted!
8 My true disciples produce much fruit.
This brings great glory to my Father.
9 "I have loved you even as the Father
has loved me. Remain in my love.
10 When you obey me, you remain in
my love, just as I obey my Father and
remain in his love.
11 I have told you this so that you will
be ﬁlled with my joy. Yes, your joy will
overﬂow!
12 I command you to love each other in
the same way that I love you.
13 And here is how to measure it––the
greatest love is shown when people lay
down their lives for their friends.
14 You are my friends if you obey me.JOHN 15
103
15 I no longer call you servants, because
a master doesn’t conﬁde in his servants.
Now you are my friends, since I have told
you everything the Father told me.
16 You didn’t choose me. I chose you. I
appointed you to go and produce fruit
that will last, so that the Father will
give you whatever you ask for, using my
name.
17 I command you to love each other.
18 "When the world hates you,
remember it hated me before it hated
you.
19 The world would love you if you
belonged to it, but you don’t. I chose
you to come out of the world, and so it
hates you.
20 Do you remember what I told you? ‘A
servant is not greater than the master.’
Since they persecuted me, naturally
they will persecute you. And if they had
listened to me, they would listen to you!JOHN 15
104
21 The people of the world will hate
you because you belong to me, for they
don’t know God who sent me.
22 They would not be guilty if I had not
come and spoken to them. But now they
have no excuse for their sin.
23 Anyone who hates me hates my
Father, too.
24 If I hadn’t done such miraculous signs
among them that no one else could do,
they would not be counted guilty. But as
it is, they saw all that I did and yet hated
both of us––me and my Father.
25 This has fulﬁlled what the Scriptures
said: ‘They hated me without cause.’
26 "But I will send you the Counselor
––the Spirit of truth. He will come to
you from the Father and will tell you all
about me.
27 And you must also tell others about
me because you have been with me
from the beginning.JOHN 16
16
105
1 "I have told you these things so
that you won’t fall away.
2 For you will be expelled from the
synagogues, and the me is coming
when those who kill you will think they
are doing God a service.
3 This is because they have never known
the Father or me.
4 Yes, I’m telling you these things now,
so that when they happen, you will
remember I warned you. I didn’t tell you
earlier because I was going to be with
you for a while longer.
5 "But now I am going away to the one
who sent me, and none of you has asked
me where I am going.
6 Instead, you are very sad.
7 But it is actually best for you that I go
away, because if I don’t, the Counselor
won’t come. If I do go away, he will come
because I will send him to you.JOHN 16
106
8 And when he comes, he will convince
the world of its sin, and of God’s
righteousness, and of the coming
judgment.
9 The world’s sin is unbelief in me.
10 Righteousness is available because I
go to the Father, and you will see me no
more.
11 Judgment will come because the
prince of this world has already been
judged.
12 "Oh, there is so much more I want to
tell you, but you can’t bear it now.
13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he
will guide you into all truth. He will not
be presen ng his own ideas; he will be
telling you what he has heard. He will
tell you about the future.
14 He will bring me glory by revealing to
you whatever he receives from me.
15 All that the Father has is mine; this is
what I mean when I say that the SpiritJOHN 16
107
will reveal to you whatever he receives
from me.
16 "In just a li le while I will be gone,
and you won’t see me anymore. Then,
just a li le while a er that, you will see
me again."
17 The disciples asked each other,
"What does he mean when he says, ‘You
won’t see me, and then you will see
me’? And what does he mean when he
says, ‘I am going to the Father’?
18 And what does he mean by ‘a li le
while’? We don’t understand."
19 Jesus realized they wanted to
ask him, so he said, "Are you asking
yourselves what I meant? I said in just a
li le while I will be gone, and you won’t
see me anymore. Then, just a li le while
a er that, you will see me again.
20 Truly, you will weep and mourn over
what is going to happen to me, but
the world will rejoice. You will grieve,JOHN 16
108
but your grief will suddenly turn to
wonderful joy when you see me again.
21 It will be like a woman experiencing
the pains of labor. When her child is
born, her anguish gives place to joy
because she has brought a new person
into the world.
22 You have sorrow now, but I will see
you again; then you will rejoice, and no
one can rob you of that joy.
23 At that me you won’t need to ask
me for anything. The truth is, you can go
directly to the Father and ask him, and
he will grant your request because you
use my name.
24 You haven’t done this before. Ask,
using my name, and you will receive,
and you will have abundant joy.
25 "I have spoken of these ma ers in
parables, but the me will come when
this will not be necessary, and I will tell
you plainly all about the Father.JOHN 16
109
26 Then you will ask in my name. I’m
not saying I will ask the Father on your
behalf,
27 for the Father himself loves you
dearly because you love me and believe
that I came from God.
28 Yes, I came from the Father into the
world, and I will leave the world and
return to the Father."
29 Then his disciples said, "At last you
are speaking plainly and not in parables.
30 Now we understand that you know
everything and don’t need anyone to tell
you anything. From this we believe that
you came from God."
31 Jesus asked, "Do you ﬁnally believe?
32 But the me is coming––in fact,
it is already here––when you will be
sca ered, each one going his own way,
leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone
because the Father is with me.JOHN 16 – 17
110
33 I have told you all this so that you
may have peace in me. Here on earth
you will have many trials and sorrows.
But take heart, because I have overcome
the world."
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished saying
all these things, he looked up to
heaven and said, "Father, the me has
come. Glorify your Son so he can give
glory back to you.
2 For you have given him authority
over everyone in all the earth. He gives
eternal life to each one you have given
him.
3 And this is the way to have eternal
life––to know you, the only true God,
and Jesus Christ, the one you sent to
earth.
4 I brought glory to you here on earth
by doing everything you told me to do.
5 And now, Father, bring me into the
glory we shared before the world began.
17JOHN 17
111
6 "I have told these men about you.
They were in the world, but then you
gave them to me. Actually, they were
always yours, and you gave them to me;
and they have kept your word.
7 Now they know that everything I have
is a gi from you,
8 for I have passed on to them the
words you gave me; and they accepted
them and know that I came from you,
and they believe you sent me.
9 "My prayer is not for the world, but
for those you have given me, because
they belong to you.
10 And all of them, since they are mine,
belong to you; and you have given them
back to me, so they are my glory!
11 Now I am depar ng the world; I am
leaving them behind and coming to you.
Holy Father, keep them and care for
them––all those you have given me––so
that they will be united just as we are.JOHN 17
12 During my
112
me here, I have kept
them safe. I guarded them so that not
one was lost, except the one headed for
destruc on, as the Scriptures foretold.
13 "And now I am coming to you. I have
told them many things while I was with
them so they would be ﬁlled with my joy.
14 I have given them your word. And
the world hates them because they do
not belong to the world, just as I do not.
15 I’m not asking you to take them out
of the world, but to keep them safe from
the evil one.
16 They are not part of this world any
more than I am.
17 Make them pure and holy by teaching
them your words of truth.
18 As you sent me into the world, I am
sending them into the world.
19 And I give myself en rely to you so
they also might be en rely yours.JOHN 17
113
20 "I am praying not only for these
disciples but also for all who will ever
believe in me because of their tes mony.
21 My prayer for all of them is that they
will be one, just as you and I are one,
Father––that just as you are in me and I
am in you, so they will be in us, and the
world will believe you sent me.
22 "I have given them the glory you
gave me, so that they may be one, as we
are––
23 I in them and you in me, all being
perfected into one. Then the world
will know that you sent me and will
understand that you love them as much
as you love me.
24 Father, I want these whom you’ve
given me to be with me, so they can see
my glory. You gave me the glory because
you loved me even before the world
began!JOHN 17 – 18
114
25 "O righteous Father, the world
doesn’t know you, but I do; and these
disciples know you sent me.
26 And I have revealed you to them and
will keep on revealing you. I will do this
so that your love for me may be in them
and I in them."
1 A er saying these things, Jesus
crossed the Kidron Valley with his
disciples and entered a grove of olive
trees.
2 Judas, the betrayer, knew this place,
because Jesus had gone there many
mes with his disciples.
3 The leading priests and Pharisees had
given Judas a ba alion of Roman soldiers
and Temple guards to accompany him.
Now with blazing torches, lanterns, and
weapons, they arrived at the olive grove.
4 Jesus fully realized all that was going
to happen to him. Stepping forward to
18JOHN 18
115
meet them, he asked, "Whom are you
looking for?"
5 "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I
am he," Jesus said. Judas was standing
there with them when Jesus iden ﬁed
himself.
6 And as he said, "I am he," they all fell
backward to the ground!
7 Once more he asked them, "Whom
are you searching for?" And again they
replied, "Jesus of Nazareth."
8 "I told you that I am he," Jesus said.
"And since I am the one you want, let
these others go."
9 He did this to fulﬁll his own statement:
"I have not lost a single one of those you
gave me."
10 Then Simon Peter drew a sword and
slashed oﬀ the right ear of Malchus, the
high priest’s servant.
11 But Jesus said to Peter, "Put your
sword back into its sheath. Shall I notJOHN 18
116
drink from the cup the Father has given
me?"
12 So the soldiers, their commanding
oﬃcer, and the Temple guards arrested
Jesus and ed him up.
13 First they took him to Annas, the
father–in–law of Caiaphas, the high
priest that year.
14 Caiaphas was the one who had told
the other Jewish leaders, "Be er that
one should die for all."
15 Simon Peter followed along behind,
as did another of the disciples. That
other disciple was acquainted with the
high priest, so he was allowed to enter
the courtyard with Jesus.
16 Peter stood outside the gate. Then
the other disciple spoke to the woman
watching at the gate, and she let Peter
in.JOHN 18
117
17 The woman asked Peter, "Aren’t you
one of Jesus’ disciples?" "No," he said, "I
am not."
18 The guards and the household
servants were standing around a
charcoal ﬁre they had made because it
was cold. And Peter stood there with
them, warming himself.
19 Inside, the high priest began asking
Jesus about his followers and what he
had been teaching them.
20 Jesus replied, "What I teach is
widely known, because I have preached
regularly in the synagogues and the
Temple. I have been heard by people
everywhere, and I teach nothing in
private that I have not said in public.
21 Why are you asking me this ques on?
Ask those who heard me. They know
what I said."
22 One of the Temple guards standing
there struck Jesus on the face. "Is thatJOHN 18
118
the way to answer the high priest?" he
demanded.
23 Jesus replied, "If I said anything
wrong, you must give evidence for it.
Should you hit a man for telling the
truth?"
24 Then Annas bound Jesus and sent
him to Caiaphas, the high priest.
25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was
standing by the ﬁre, they asked him
again, "Aren’t you one of his disciples?"
"I am not," he said.
26 But one of the household servants
of the high priest, a rela ve of the man
whose ear Peter had cut oﬀ, asked,
"Didn’t I see you out there in the olive
grove with Jesus?"
27 Again Peter denied it. And
immediately a rooster crowed.
28 Jesus’ trial before Caiaphas ended
in the early hours of the morning. Then
he was taken to the headquarters of theJOHN 18
119
Roman governor. His accusers didn’t go
in themselves because it would deﬁle
them, and they wouldn’t be allowed to
celebrate the Passover feast.
29 So Pilate, the governor, went out to
them and asked, "What is your charge
against this man?"
30 "We wouldn’t have handed him over
to you if he weren’t a criminal!" they
retorted.
31 "Then take him away and judge him
by your own laws," Pilate told them.
"Only the Romans are permi ed to
execute someone," the Jewish leaders
replied.
32 This fulﬁlled Jesus’ predic on about
the way he would die.
33 Then Pilate went back inside and
called for Jesus to be brought to him.
"Are you the King of the Jews?" he asked
him.JOHN 18
120
34 Jesus replied, "Is this your own
ques on, or did others tell you about
me?"
35 "Am I a Jew?" Pilate asked. "Your own
people and their leading priests brought
you here. Why? What have you done?"
36 Then Jesus answered, "I am not an
earthly king. If I were, my followers
would have fought when I was arrested
by the Jewish leaders. But my Kingdom
is not of this world."
37 Pilate replied, "You are a king then?"
"You say that I am a king, and you are
right," Jesus said. "I was born for that
purpose. And I came to bring truth to the
world. All who love the truth recognize
that what I say is true."
38 "What is truth?" Pilate asked. Then
he went out again to the people and told
them, "He is not guilty of any crime.
39 But you have a custom of asking me
to release someone from prison eachJOHN 18 – 19
121
year at Passover. So if you want me to,
I’ll release the King of the Jews."
40 But they shouted back, "No! Not this
man, but Barabbas!" (Barabbas was a
criminal.)
1 Then Pilate had Jesus ﬂogged
with a lead– pped whip.
2 The soldiers made a crown of long,
sharp thorns and put it on his head, and
they put a royal purple robe on him.
3 "Hail! King of the Jews!" they mocked,
and they hit him with their ﬁsts.
4 Pilate went outside again and said to
the people, "I am going to bring him out
to you now, but understand clearly that I
ﬁnd him not guilty."
5 Then Jesus came out wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple robe.
And Pilate said, "Here is the man!"
6 When they saw him, the leading
priests and Temple guards began
19JOHN 19
122
shou ng, "Crucify! Crucify!" "You crucify
him," Pilate said. "I ﬁnd him not guilty."
7 The Jewish leaders replied, "By our
laws he ought to die because he called
himself the Son of God."
8 When Pilate heard this, he was more
frightened than ever.
9 He took Jesus back into the
headquarters again and asked him,
"Where are you from?" But Jesus gave
no answer.
10 "You won’t talk to me?" Pilate
demanded. "Don’t you realize that I have
the power to release you or to crucify
you?"
11 Then Jesus said, "You would have
no power over me at all unless it were
given to you from above. So the one who
brought me to you has the greater sin."
12 Then Pilate tried to release him,
but the Jewish leaders told him, "If you
release this man, you are not a friend ofJOHN 19
123
Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a
king is a rebel against Caesar."
13 When they said this, Pilate brought
Jesus out to them again. Then Pilate
sat down on the judgment seat on
the pla orm that is called the Stone
Pavement (in Hebrew, Gabbatha).
14 It was now about noon of the day of
prepara on for the Passover. And Pilate
said to the people, "Here is your king!"
15 "Away with him," they yelled. "Away
with him––crucify him!" "What? Crucify
your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no
king but Caesar," the leading priests
shouted back.
16 Then Pilate gave Jesus to them to be
cruciﬁed. So they took Jesus and led him
away.
17 Carrying the cross by himself, Jesus
went to the place called Skull Hill (in
Hebrew, Golgotha).JOHN 19
124
18 There they cruciﬁed him. There were
two others cruciﬁed with him, one on
either side, with Jesus between them.
19 And Pilate posted a sign over him
that read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of
the Jews."
20 The place where Jesus was cruciﬁed
was near the city; and the sign was
wri en in Hebrew, La n, and Greek, so
that many people could read it.
21 Then the leading priests said to
Pilate, "Change it from ‘The King of the
Jews’ to ‘He said, I am King of the Jews.’"
22 Pilate replied, "What I have wri en, I
have wri en. It stays exactly as it is."
23 When the soldiers had cruciﬁed
Jesus, they divided his clothes among
the four of them. They also took his
robe, but it was seamless, woven in one
piece from the top.
24 So they said, "Let’s not tear it but
throw dice to see who gets it." ThisJOHN 19
125
fulﬁlled the Scripture that says, "They
divided my clothes among themselves
and threw dice for my robe." So that is
what they did.
25 Standing near the cross were
Jesus’ mother, and his mother’s sister,
Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary
Magdalene.
26 When Jesus saw his mother standing
there beside the disciple he loved, he
said to her, "Woman, he is your son."
27 And he said to this disciple, "She is
your mother." And from then on this
disciple took her into his home.
28 Jesus knew that everything was now
ﬁnished, and to fulﬁll the Scriptures he
said, "I am thirsty."
29 A jar of sour wine was si ng there,
so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a
hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips.JOHN 19
126
30 When Jesus had tasted it, he said,
"It is ﬁnished!" Then he bowed his head
and gave up his spirit.
31 The Jewish leaders didn’t want the
vic ms hanging there the next day,
which was the Sabbath (and a very
special Sabbath at that, because it was
the Passover), so they asked Pilate to
hasten their deaths by ordering that
their legs be broken. Then their bodies
could be taken down.
32 So the soldiers came and broke the
legs of the two men cruciﬁed with Jesus.
33 But when they came to Jesus, they
saw that he was dead already, so they
didn’t break his legs.
34 One of the soldiers, however, pierced
his side with a spear, and blood and
water ﬂowed out.
35 This report is from an eyewitness
giving an accurate account; it is
presented so that you also can believe.JOHN 19
127
36 These things happened in fulﬁllment
of the Scriptures that say, "Not one of
his bones will be broken,"
37 and "They will look on him whom
they pierced."
38 A erward Joseph of Arimathea,
who had been a secret disciple of Jesus
(because he feared the Jewish leaders),
asked Pilate for permission to take
Jesus’ body down. When Pilate gave him
permission, he came and took the body
away.
39 Nicodemus, the man who had
come to Jesus at night, also came,
bringing about seventy–ﬁve pounds of
embalming ointment made from myrrh
and aloes.
40 Together they wrapped Jesus’ body
in a long linen cloth with the spices, as is
the Jewish custom of burial.JOHN 19 – 20
128
41 The place of cruciﬁxion was near a
garden, where there was a new tomb,
never used before.
42 And so, because it was the day of
prepara on before the Passover and
since the tomb was close at hand, they
laid Jesus there.
1 Early Sunday morning, while it
was s ll dark, Mary Magdalene
came to the tomb and found that the
stone had been rolled away from the
entrance.
2 She ran and found Simon Peter and
the other disciple, the one whom Jesus
loved. She said, "They have taken the
Lord’s body out of the tomb, and I don’t
know where they have put him!"
3 Peter and the other disciple ran to the
tomb to see.
4 The other disciple outran Peter and
got there ﬁrst.
20JOHN 20
129
5 He stooped and looked in and saw the
linen cloth lying there, but he didn’t go
in.
6 Then Simon Peter arrived and went
inside. He also no ced the linen
wrappings lying there,
7 while the cloth that had covered
Jesus’ head was folded up and lying to
the side.
8 Then the other disciple also went in,
and he saw and believed––
9 for un l then they hadn’t realized that
the Scriptures said he would rise from
the dead.
10 Then they went home.
11 Mary was standing outside the tomb
crying, and as she wept, she stooped
and looked in.
12 She saw two white–robed angels
si ng at the head and foot of the place
where the body of Jesus had been lying.JOHN 20
130
13 "Why are you crying?" the angels
asked her. "Because they have taken
away my Lord," she replied, "and I don’t
know where they have put him."
14 She glanced over her shoulder and
saw someone standing behind her. It
was Jesus, but she didn’t recognize him.
15 "Why are you crying?" Jesus asked
her. "Who are you looking for?" She
thought he was the gardener. "Sir," she
said, "if you have taken him away, tell
me where you have put him, and I will
go and get him."
16 "Mary!" Jesus said. She turned
toward him and exclaimed, "Teacher!"
17 "Don’t cling to me," Jesus said, "for I
haven’t yet ascended to the Father. But
go ﬁnd my brothers and tell them that
I am ascending to my Father and your
Father, my God and your God."JOHN 20
131
18 Mary Magdalene found the disciples
and told them, "I have seen the Lord!"
Then she gave them his message.
19 That evening, on the ﬁrst day of the
week, the disciples were mee ng behind
locked doors because they were afraid
of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus
was standing there among them! "Peace
be with you," he said.
20 As he spoke, he held out his hands
for them to see, and he showed them
his side. They were ﬁlled with joy when
they saw their Lord!
21 He spoke to them again and said,
"Peace be with you. As the Father has
sent me, so I send you."
22 Then he breathed on them and said
to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
23 If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are
forgiven. If you refuse to forgive them,
they are unforgiven."JOHN 20
132
24 One of the disciples, Thomas
(nicknamed the Twin), was not with the
others when Jesus came.
25 They told him, "We have seen the
Lord!" But he replied, "I won’t believe it
unless I see the nail wounds in his hands,
put my ﬁngers into them, and place my
hand into the wound in his side."
26 Eight days later the disciples were
together again, and this me Thomas
was with them. The doors were locked;
but suddenly, as before, Jesus was
standing among them. He said, "Peace
be with you."
27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your
ﬁnger here and see my hands. Put your
hand into the wound in my side. Don’t
be faithless any longer. Believe!"
28 "My Lord and my God!" Thomas
exclaimed.
29 Then Jesus told him, "You believe
because you have seen me. Blessed areJOHN 20 – 21
133
those who haven’t seen me and believe
anyway."
30 Jesus’ disciples saw him do many
other miraculous signs besides the ones
recorded in this book.
31 But these are wri en so that you
may believe that Jesus is the Messiah,
the Son of God, and that by believing in
him you will have life.
1 Later Jesus appeared again to
the disciples beside the Sea of
Galilee. This is how it happened.
2 Several of the disciples were there–
–Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed the
Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,
the sons of Zebedee, and two other
disciples.
3 Simon Peter said, "I’m going ﬁshing."
"We’ll come, too," they all said. So they
went out in the boat, but they caught
nothing all night.
21JOHN 21
134
4 At dawn the disciples saw Jesus
standing on the beach, but they couldn’t
see who he was.
5 He called out, "Friends, have you
caught any ﬁsh?" "No," they replied.
6 Then he said, "Throw out your net
on the right–hand side of the boat, and
you’ll get plenty of ﬁsh!" So they did, and
they couldn’t draw in the net because
there were so many ﬁsh in it.
7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When
Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
he put on his tunic (for he had stripped
for work), jumped into the water, and
swam ashore.
8 The others stayed with the boat and
pulled the loaded net to the shore, for
they were only out about three hundred
feet.JOHN 21
135
9 When they got there, they saw that a
charcoal ﬁre was burning and ﬁsh were
frying over it, and there was bread.
10 "Bring some of the ﬁsh you’ve just
caught," Jesus said.
11 So Simon Peter went aboard and
dragged the net to the shore. There were
153 large ﬁsh, and yet the net hadn’t
torn.
12 "Now come and have some
breakfast!" Jesus said. And no one dared
ask him if he really was the Lord because
they were sure of it.
13 Then Jesus served them the bread
and the ﬁsh.
14 This was the third me Jesus had
appeared to his disciples since he had
been raised from the dead.
15 A er breakfast Jesus said to Simon
Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love
me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," PeterJOHN 21
136
replied, "you know I love you." "Then
feed my lambs," Jesus told him.
16 Jesus repeated the ques on: "Simon
son of John, do you love me?" "Yes,
Lord," Peter said, "you know I love you."
"Then take care of my sheep," Jesus said.
17 Once more he asked him, "Simon
son of John, do you love me?" Peter was
grieved that Jesus asked the ques on
a third me. He said, "Lord, you know
everything. You know I love you." Jesus
said, "Then feed my sheep.
18 The truth is, when you were young,
you were able to do as you liked and go
wherever you wanted to. But when you
are old, you will stretch out your hands,
and others will direct you and take you
where you don’t want to go."
19 Jesus said this to let him know what
kind of death he would die to glorify
God. Then Jesus told him, "Follow me."JOHN 21
137
20 Peter turned around and saw the
disciple Jesus loved following them––the
one who had leaned over to Jesus during
supper and asked, "Lord, who among us
will betray you?"
21 Peter asked Jesus, "What about him,
Lord?"
22 Jesus replied, "If I want him to remain
alive un l I return, what is that to you?
You follow me."
23 So the rumor spread among the
community of believers that that disciple
wouldn’t die. But that isn’t what Jesus
said at all. He only said, "If I want him to
remain alive un l I return, what is that
to you?"
24 This is that disciple who saw these
events and recorded them here. And we
all know that his account of these things
is accurate.
25 And I suppose that if all the other
things Jesus did were wri en down,JOHN 21
138
the whole world could not contain the
books.Acts of the Apostles
1
1 Dear Theophilus: In my ﬁrst book
I told you about everything Jesus
began to do and teach
2 un l the day he ascended to heaven
a er giving his chosen apostles further
instruc ons from the Holy Spirit.
3 During the forty days a er his
cruciﬁxion, he appeared to the apostles
from me to me and proved to them in
many ways that he was actually alive. On
these occasions he talked to them about
the Kingdom of God.
4 In one of these mee ngs as he was
ea ng a meal with them, he told them,
"Do not leave Jerusalem un l the
Father sends you what he promised.
Remember, I have told you about this
before.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5 John bap
2
zed with water, but in just
a few days you will be bap zed with the
Holy Spirit."
6 When the apostles were with Jesus,
they kept asking him, "Lord, are you
going to free Israel now and restore our
kingdom?"
7 "The Father sets those dates," he
replied, "and they are not for you to
know.
8 But when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you, you will receive power and
will tell people about me everywhere–
–in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
9 It was not long a er he said this that
he was taken up into the sky while they
were watching, and he disappeared into
a cloud.
10 As they were straining their eyes to
see him, two white–robed men suddenly
stood there among them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
3
11 They said, "Men of Galilee, why are
you standing here staring at the sky?
Jesus has been taken away from you into
heaven. And someday, just as you saw
him go, he will return!"
12 The apostles were at the Mount of
Olives when this happened, so they
walked the half mile back to Jerusalem.
13 Then they went to the upstairs room
of the house where they were staying.
Here is the list of those who were
present: Peter, John, James, Andrew,
Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Ma hew,
James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (the
Zealot), and Judas (son of James).
14 They all met together con nually for
prayer, along with Mary the mother of
Jesus, several other women, and the
brothers of Jesus.
15 During this me, on a day when
about 120 believers were present, Peter
stood up and addressed them as follows:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
4
16 "Brothers, it was necessary for the
Scriptures to be fulﬁlled concerning
Judas, who guided the Temple police to
arrest Jesus. This was predicted long ago
by the Holy Spirit, speaking through King
David.
17 Judas was one of us, chosen to share
in the ministry with us."
18 (Judas bought a ﬁeld with the money
he received for his treachery, and falling
there, he burst open, spilling out his
intes nes.
19 The news of his death spread rapidly
among all the people of Jerusalem,
and they gave the place the Aramaic
name Akeldama, which means "Field of
Blood.")
20 Peter con nued, "This was predicted
in the book of Psalms, where it says, ‘Let
his home become desolate, with no one
living in it.’ And again, ‘Let his posi on
be given to someone else.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5
21 "So now we must choose another
man to take Judas’s place. It must be
someone who has been with us all the
me that we were with the Lord Jesus––
22 from the me he was bap zed by
John un l the day he was taken from us
into heaven. Whoever is chosen will join
us as a witness of Jesus’ resurrec on."
23 So they nominated two men: Joseph
called Barsabbas (also known as Justus)
and Ma hias.
24 Then they all prayed for the right
man to be chosen. "O Lord," they said,
"you know every heart. Show us which
of these men you have chosen
25 as an apostle to replace Judas
the traitor in this ministry, for he
has deserted us and gone where he
belongs."
26 Then they cast lots, and in this way
Ma hias was chosen and became an
apostle with the other eleven.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2

1 On the day of Pentecost, seven
weeks a er Jesus’ resurrec on, the
believers were mee ng together in one
place.
2 Suddenly, there was a sound from
heaven like the roaring of a mighty
windstorm in the skies above them,
and it ﬁlled the house where they were
mee ng.
3 Then, what looked like ﬂames or
tongues of ﬁre appeared and se led on
each of them.
4 And everyone present was ﬁlled with
the Holy Spirit and began speaking in
other languages, as the Holy Spirit gave
them this ability.
5 Godly Jews from many na ons were
living in Jerusalem at that me.
6 When they heard this sound, they
came running to see what it was all
about, and they were bewildered toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
7
hear their own languages being spoken
by the believers.
7 They were beside themselves with
wonder. "How can this be?" they
exclaimed. "These people are all from
Galilee,
8 and yet we hear them speaking the
languages of the lands where we were
born!
9 Here we are––Parthians, Medes,
Elamites, people from Mesopotamia,
Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province
of Asia,
10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the
areas of Libya toward Cyrene, visitors
from Rome (both Jews and converts to
Judaism),
11 Cretans, and Arabians. And we all
hear these people speaking in our own
languages about the wonderful things
God has done!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
8
12 They stood there amazed and
perplexed. "What can this mean?" they
asked each other.
13 But others in the crowd were
mocking. "They’re drunk, that’s all!"
they said.
14 Then Peter stepped forward with the
eleven other apostles and shouted to
the crowd, "Listen carefully, all of you,
fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem!
Make no mistake about this.
15 Some of you are saying these people
are drunk. It isn’t true! It’s much too
early for that. People don’t get drunk by
nine o’clock in the morning.
16 No, what you see this morning was
predicted centuries ago by the prophet
Joel:
17 ‘In the last days, God said, I will pour
out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons
and daughters will prophesy, your youngACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
9
men will see visions, and your old men
will dream dreams.
18 In those days I will pour out my Spirit
upon all my servants, men and women
alike, and they will prophesy.
19 And I will cause wonders in the
heavens above and signs on the earth
below––blood and ﬁre and clouds of
smoke.
20 The sun will be turned into darkness,
and the moon will turn bloodred, before
that great and glorious day of the Lord
arrives.
21 And anyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved.’
22 "People of Israel, listen! God publicly
endorsed Jesus of Nazareth by doing
wonderful miracles, wonders, and signs
through him, as you well know.
23 But you followed God’s prearranged
plan. With the help of lawless Gen les,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
10
you nailed him to the cross and
murdered him.
24 However, God released him from the
horrors of death and raised him back to
life again, for death could not keep him
in its grip.
25 King David said this about him: ‘I
know the Lord is always with me. I will
not be shaken, for he is right beside me.
26 No wonder my heart is ﬁlled with joy,
and my mouth shouts his praises! My
body rests in hope.
27 For you will not leave my soul among
the dead or allow your Holy One to rot
in the grave.
28 You have shown me the way of life,
and you will give me wonderful joy in
your presence.’
29 "Dear brothers, think about this!
David wasn’t referring to himself when
he spoke these words I have quoted, forACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
11
he died and was buried, and his tomb is
s ll here among us.
30 But he was a prophet, and he knew
God had promised with an oath that one
of David’s own descendants would sit on
David’s throne as the Messiah.
31 David was looking into the future and
predic ng the Messiah’s resurrec on.
He was saying that the Messiah would
not be le among the dead and that his
body would not rot in the grave.
32 "This prophecy was speaking of
Jesus, whom God raised from the dead,
and we all are witnesses of this.
33 Now he sits on the throne of highest
honor in heaven, at God’s right hand.
And the Father, as he had promised, gave
him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us,
just as you see and hear today.
34 For David himself never ascended
into heaven, yet he said, ‘The LORD said
to my Lord, Sit in honor at my right handACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
35 un
12
l I humble your enemies, making
them a footstool under your feet.’
36 So let it be clearly known by everyone
in Israel that God has made this Jesus
whom you cruciﬁed to be both Lord and
Messiah!"
37 Peter’s words convicted them deeply,
and they said to him and to the other
apostles, "Brothers, what should we
do?"
38 Peter replied, "Each of you must turn
from your sins and turn to God, and be
bap zed in the name of Jesus Christ for
the forgiveness of your sins. Then you
will receive the gi of the Holy Spirit.
39 This promise is to you and to your
children, and even to the Gen les ––all
who have been called by the Lord our
God."
40 Then Peter con nued preaching
for a long me, strongly urging all hisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
13
listeners, "Save yourselves from this
genera on that has gone astray!"
41 Those who believed what Peter
said were bap zed and added to the
church––about three thousand in all.
42 They joined with the other believers
and devoted themselves to the apostles’
teaching and fellowship, sharing in the
Lord’s Supper and in prayer.
43 A deep sense of awe came over them
all, and the apostles performed many
miraculous signs and wonders.
44 And all the believers met together
constantly and shared everything they
had.
45 They sold their possessions and
shared the proceeds with those in need.
46 They worshiped together at the
Temple each day, met in homes for the
Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals
with great joy and generosity––ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2 – 3
14
47 all the while praising God and
enjoying the goodwill of all the people.
And each day the Lord added to their
group those who were being saved.
1 Peter and John went to the Temple
one a ernoon to take part in the
three o’clock prayer service.
2 As they approached the Temple, a
man lame from birth was being carried
in. Each day he was put beside the
Temple gate, the one called the Beau ful
Gate, so he could beg from the people
going into the Temple.
3 When he saw Peter and John about to
enter, he asked them for some money.
4 Peter and John looked at him intently,
and Peter said, "Look at us!"
5 The lame man looked at them eagerly,
expec ng a gi .
6 But Peter said, "I don’t have any
money for you. But I’ll give you what
3ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
15
I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, get up and walk!"
7 Then Peter took the lame man by the
right hand and helped him up. And as he
did, the man’s feet and anklebones were
healed and strengthened.
8 He jumped up, stood on his feet, and
began to walk! Then, walking, leaping,
and praising God, he went into the
Temple with them.
9 All the people saw him walking and
heard him praising God.
10 When they realized he was the lame
beggar they had seen so o en at the
Beau ful Gate, they were absolutely
astounded!
11 They all rushed out to Solomon’s
Colonnade, where he was holding ghtly
to Peter and John. Everyone stood there
in awe of the wonderful thing that had
happened.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
16
12 Peter saw his opportunity and
addressed the crowd. "People of Israel,"
he said, "what is so astounding about
this? And why look at us as though we
had made this man walk by our own
power and godliness?
13 For it is the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of
all our ancestors who has brought glory
to his servant Jesus by doing this. This
is the same Jesus whom you handed
over and rejected before Pilate, despite
Pilate’s decision to release him.
14 You rejected this holy, righteous one
and instead demanded the release of a
murderer.
15 You killed the author of life, but God
raised him to life. And we are witnesses
of this fact!
16 "The name of Jesus has healed this
man––and you know how lame he wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
17
before. Faith in Jesus’ name has caused
this healing before your very eyes.
17 "Friends, I realize that what you did
to Jesus was done in ignorance; and the
same can be said of your leaders.
18 But God was fulﬁlling what all
the prophets had declared about the
Messiah beforehand––that he must
suﬀer all these things.
19 Now turn from your sins and turn to
God, so you can be cleansed of your sins.
20 Then wonderful mes of refreshment
will come from the presence of the Lord,
and he will send Jesus your Messiah to
you again.
21 For he must remain in heaven un l
the me for the ﬁnal restora on of
all things, as God promised long ago
through his prophets.
22 Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will
raise up a Prophet like me from amongACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3 – 4
18
your own people. Listen carefully to
everything he tells you.’
23 Then Moses said, ‘Anyone who
will not listen to that Prophet will be
cut oﬀ from God’s people and u erly
destroyed.’
24 "Star ng with Samuel, every prophet
spoke about what is happening today.
25 You are the children of those
prophets, and you are included in
the covenant God promised to your
ancestors. For God said to Abraham,
‘Through your descendants all the
families on earth will be blessed.’
26 When God raised up his servant, he
sent him ﬁrst to you people of Israel, to
bless you by turning each of you back
from your sinful ways."
1 While Peter and John were
speaking to the people, the leading
priests, the captain of the Temple guard,
4ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
19
and some of the Sadducees came over
to them.
2 They were very disturbed that Peter
and John were claiming, on the authority
of Jesus, that there is a resurrec on of
the dead.
3 They arrested them and, since it
was already evening, jailed them un l
morning.
4 But many of the people who heard
their message believed it, so that the
number of believers totaled about ﬁve
thousand men, not coun ng women and
children.
5 The next day the council of all the
rulers and elders and teachers of
religious law met in Jerusalem.
6 Annas the high priest was there, along
with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and
other rela ves of the high priest.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
20
7 They brought in the two disciples and
demanded, "By what power, or in whose
name, have you done this?"
8 Then Peter, ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit,
said to them, "Leaders and elders of our
na on,
9 are we being ques oned because
we’ve done a good deed for a crippled
man? Do you want to know how he was
healed?
10 Let me clearly state to you and to all
the people of Israel that he was healed
in the name and power of Jesus Christ
from Nazareth, the man you cruciﬁed,
but whom God raised from the dead.
11 For Jesus is the one referred to in the
Scriptures, where it says, ‘The stone that
you builders rejected has now become
the cornerstone.’
12 There is salva on in no one else!
There is no other name in all of heaven
for people to call on to save them."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
21
13 The members of the council were
amazed when they saw the boldness of
Peter and John, for they could see that
they were ordinary men who had had
no special training. They also recognized
them as men who had been with Jesus.
14 But since the man who had been
healed was standing right there among
them, the council had nothing to say.
15 So they sent Peter and John out
of the council chamber and conferred
among themselves.
16 "What should we do with these
men?" they asked each other. "We can’t
deny they have done a miraculous sign,
and everybody in Jerusalem knows
about it.
17 But perhaps we can stop them from
spreading their propaganda. We’ll warn
them not to speak to anyone in Jesus’
name again."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
22
18 So they called the apostles back in
and told them never again to speak or
teach about Jesus.
19 But Peter and John replied, "Do you
think God wants us to obey you rather
than him?
20 We cannot stop telling about the
wonderful things we have seen and
heard."
21 The council then threatened them
further, but they ﬁnally let them go
because they didn’t know how to
punish them without star ng a riot. For
everyone was praising God
22 for this miraculous sign––the healing
of a man who had been lame for more
than forty years.
23 As soon as they were freed, Peter
and John found the other believers and
told them what the leading priests and
elders had said.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
23
24 Then all the believers were united
as they li ed their voices in prayer: "O
Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and
earth, the sea, and everything in them––
25 you spoke long ago by the Holy Spirit
through our ancestor King David, your
servant, saying, ‘Why did the na ons
rage? Why did the people waste their
me with fu le plans?
26 The kings of the earth prepared for
ba le; the rulers gathered together
against the Lord and against his Messiah.’
27 "That is what has happened here
in this city! For Herod An pas, Pon us
Pilate the governor, the Gen les, and the
people of Israel were all united against
Jesus, your holy servant, whom you
anointed.
28 In fact, everything they did occurred
according to your eternal will and plan.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
24
29 And now, O Lord, hear their threats,
and give your servants great boldness in
their preaching.
30 Send your healing power; may
miraculous signs and wonders be done
through the name of your holy servant
Jesus."
31 A er this prayer, the building where
they were mee ng shook, and they were
all ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit. And they
preached God’s message with boldness.
32 All the believers were of one heart
and mind, and they felt that what they
owned was not their own; they shared
everything they had.
33 And the apostles gave powerful
witness to the resurrec on of the Lord
Jesus, and God’s great favor was upon
them all.
34 There was no poverty among them,
because people who owned land or
houses sold themACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4 – 5
25
35 and brought the money to the
apostles to give to others in need.
36 For instance, there was Joseph, the
one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas
(which means "Son of Encouragement").
He was from the tribe of Levi and came
from the island of Cyprus.
37 He sold a ﬁeld he owned and brought
the money to the apostles for those in
need.
1 There was also a man named
Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira,
sold some property.
2 He brought part of the money to the
apostles, but he claimed it was the full
amount. His wife had agreed to this
decep on.
3 Then Peter said, "Ananias, why has
Satan ﬁlled your heart? You lied to the
Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the
money for yourself.
5ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
26
4 The property was yours to sell or not
sell, as you wished. And a er selling
it, the money was yours to give away.
How could you do a thing like this? You
weren’t lying to us but to God."
5 As soon as Ananias heard these words,
he fell to the ﬂoor and died. Everyone
who heard about it was terriﬁed.
6 Then some young men wrapped him
in a sheet and took him out and buried
him.
7 About three hours later his wife came
in, not knowing what had happened.
8 Peter asked her, "Was this the price
you and your husband received for your
land?" "Yes," she replied, "that was the
price."
9 And Peter said, "How could the two
of you even think of doing a thing like
this––conspiring together to test the
Spirit of the Lord? Just outside that door
are the young men who buried yourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
27
husband, and they will carry you out,
too."
10 Instantly, she fell to the ﬂoor and
died. When the young men came in and
saw that she was dead, they carried her
out and buried her beside her husband.
11 Great fear gripped the en re church
and all others who heard what had
happened.
12 Meanwhile, the apostles were
performing many miraculous signs and
wonders among the people. And the
believers were mee ng regularly at the
Temple in the area known as Solomon’s
Colonnade.
13 No one else dared to join them,
though everyone had high regard for
them.
14 And more and more people believed
and were brought to the Lord––crowds
of both men and women.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
28
15 As a result of the apostles’ work,
sick people were brought out into the
streets on beds and mats so that Peter’s
shadow might fall across some of them
as he went by.
16 Crowds came in from the villages
around Jerusalem, bringing their sick
and those possessed by evil spirits, and
they were all healed.
17 The high priest and his friends, who
were Sadducees, reacted with violent
jealousy.
18 They arrested the apostles and put
them in the jail.
19 But an angel of the Lord came at
night, opened the gates of the jail, and
brought them out. Then he told them,
20 "Go to the Temple and give the
people this message of life!"
21 So the apostles entered the Temple
about daybreak and immediately began
teaching. When the high priest andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
29
his oﬃcials arrived, they convened the
high council, along with all the elders of
Israel. Then they sent for the apostles to
be brought for trial.
22 But when the Temple guards went
to the jail, the men were gone. So they
returned to the council and reported,
23 "The jail was locked, with the guards
standing outside, but when we opened
the gates, no one was there!"
24 When the captain of the Temple
guard and the leading priests heard this,
they were perplexed, wondering where
it would all end.
25 Then someone arrived with the news
that the men they had jailed were out in
the Temple, teaching the people.
26 The captain went with his Temple
guards and arrested them, but without
violence, for they were afraid the people
would kill them if they treated the
apostles roughly.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
30
27 Then they brought the apostles in
before the council.
28 "Didn’t we tell you never again to
teach in this man’s name?" the high
priest demanded. "Instead, you have
ﬁlled all Jerusalem with your teaching
about Jesus, and you intend to blame us
for his death!"
29 But Peter and the apostles replied,
"We must obey God rather than human
authority.
30 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus
from the dead a er you killed him by
crucifying him.
31 Then God put him in the place of
honor at his right hand as Prince and
Savior. He did this to give the people of
Israel an opportunity to turn from their
sins and turn to God so their sins would
be forgiven.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
31
32 We are witnesses of these things and
so is the Holy Spirit, who is given by God
to those who obey him."
33 At this, the high council was furious
and decided to kill them.
34 But one member had a diﬀerent
perspec ve. He was a Pharisee named
Gamaliel, who was an expert on religious
law and was very popular with the
people. He stood up and ordered that
the apostles be sent outside the council
chamber for a while.
35 Then he addressed his colleagues as
follows: "Men of Israel, take care what
you are planning to do to these men!
36 Some me ago there was that fellow
Theudas, who pretended to be someone
great. About four hundred others joined
him, but he was killed, and his followers
went their various ways. The whole
movement came to nothing.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
37 A
32
er him, at the me of the census,
there was Judas of Galilee. He got some
people to follow him, but he was killed,
too, and all his followers were sca ered.
38 "So my advice is, leave these men
alone. If they are teaching and doing
these things merely on their own, it will
soon be overthrown.
39 But if it is of God, you will not be
able to stop them. You may even ﬁnd
yourselves ﬁgh ng against God."
40 The council accepted his advice. They
called in the apostles and had them
ﬂogged. Then they ordered them never
again to speak in the name of Jesus, and
they let them go.
41 The apostles le the high council
rejoicing that God had counted them
worthy to suﬀer dishonor for the name
of Jesus.
42 And every day, in the Temple and in
their homes, they con nued to teachACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
33
and preach this message: "The Messiah
you are looking for is Jesus."
1 But as the believers rapidly
mul plied, there were rumblings
of discontent. Those who spoke Greek
complained against those who spoke
Hebrew, saying that their widows were
being discriminated against in the daily
distribu on of food.
2 So the Twelve called a mee ng of
all the believers. "We apostles should
spend our me preaching and teaching
the word of God, not administering a
food program," they said.
3 "Now look around among yourselves,
brothers, and select seven men who are
well respected and are full of the Holy
Spirit and wisdom. We will put them in
charge of this business.
4 Then we can spend our me in prayer
and preaching and teaching the word."
6ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
34
5 This idea pleased the whole group,
and they chose the following: Stephen
(a man full of faith and the Holy
Spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon,
Parmenas, and Nicolas of An och (a
Gen le convert to the Jewish faith, who
had now become a Chris an).
6 These seven were presented to the
apostles, who prayed for them as they
laid their hands on them.
7 God’s message was preached in
ever–widening circles. The number of
believers greatly increased in Jerusalem,
and many of the Jewish priests were
converted, too.
8 Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and
power, performed amazing miracles and
signs among the people.
9 But one day some men from the
Synagogue of Freed Slaves, as it was
called, started to debate with him. TheyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
35
were Jews from Cyrene, Alexandria,
Cilicia, and the province of Asia.
10 None of them was able to stand
against the wisdom and Spirit by which
Stephen spoke.
11 So they persuaded some men to lie
about Stephen, saying, "We heard him
blaspheme Moses, and even God."
12 Naturally, this roused the crowds, the
elders, and the teachers of religious law.
So they arrested Stephen and brought
him before the high council.
13 The lying witnesses said, "This man is
always speaking against the Temple and
against the law of Moses.
14 We have heard him say that this Jesus
of Nazareth will destroy the Temple
and change the customs Moses handed
down to us."
15 At this point everyone in the council
stared at Stephen because his face
became as bright as an angel’s.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
7
36
1 Then the high priest asked Stephen,
"Are these accusa ons true?"
2 This was Stephen’s reply: "Brothers
and honorable fathers, listen to me. Our
glorious God appeared to our ancestor
Abraham in Mesopotamia before he
moved to Haran.
3 God told him, ‘Leave your na ve land
and your rela ves, and come to the land
that I will show you.’
4 So Abraham le the land of the
Chaldeans and lived in Haran un l his
father died. Then God brought him here
to the land where you now live.
5 But God gave him no inheritance here,
not even one square foot of land. God
did promise, however, that eventually
the whole country would belong to
Abraham and his descendants––though
he had no children yet.
6 But God also told him that his
descendants would live in a foreignACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
37
country where they would be mistreated
as slaves for four hundred years.
7 ‘But I will punish the na on that
enslaves them,’ God told him, ‘and in the
end they will come out and worship me
in this place.’
8 God also gave Abraham the covenant
of circumcision at that me. And so
Isaac, Abraham’s son, was circumcised
when he was eight days old. Isaac
became the father of Jacob, and Jacob
was the father of the twelve patriarchs
of the Jewish na on.
9 "These sons of Jacob were very
jealous of their brother Joseph, and they
sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God
was with him
10 and delivered him from his anguish.
And God gave him favor before Pharaoh,
king of Egypt. God also gave Joseph
unusual wisdom, so that Pharaoh
appointed him governor over all of EgyptACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
38
and put him in charge of all the aﬀairs of
the palace.
11 "But a famine came upon Egypt and
Canaan. There was great misery for our
ancestors, as they ran out of food.
12 Jacob heard that there was s ll grain
in Egypt, so he sent his sons to buy some.
13 The second me they went, Joseph
revealed his iden ty to his brothers, and
they were introduced to Pharaoh.
14 Then Joseph sent for his father,
Jacob, and all his rela ves to come to
Egypt, seventy–ﬁve persons in all.
15 So Jacob went to Egypt. He died
there, as did all his sons.
16 All of them were taken to Shechem
and buried in the tomb Abraham had
bought from the sons of Hamor in
Shechem.
17 "As the me drew near when God
would fulﬁll his promise to Abraham, theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
39
number of our people in Egypt greatly
increased.
18 But then a new king came to the
throne of Egypt who knew nothing about
Joseph.
19 This king plo ed against our people
and forced parents to abandon their
newborn babies so they would die.
20 "At that me Moses was born––a
beau ful child in God’s eyes. His parents
cared for him at home for three months.
21 When at last they had to abandon
him, Pharaoh’s daughter found him and
raised him as her own son.
22 Moses was taught all the wisdom of
the Egyp ans, and he became mighty in
both speech and ac on.
23 "One day when he was forty years
old, he decided to visit his rela ves, the
people of Israel.
24 During this visit, he saw an Egyp an
mistrea ng a man of Israel. So MosesACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
40
came to his defense and avenged him,
killing the Egyp an.
25 Moses assumed his brothers would
realize that God had sent him to rescue
them, but they didn’t.
26 "The next day he visited them again
and saw two men of Israel ﬁgh ng. He
tried to be a peacemaker. ‘Men,’ he said,
‘you are brothers. Why are you hur ng
each other?’
27 "But the man in the wrong pushed
Moses aside and told him to mind his
own business. ‘Who made you a ruler
and judge over us?’ he asked.
28 ‘Are you going to kill me as you killed
that Egyp an yesterday?’
29 When Moses heard that, he ﬂed the
country and lived as a foreigner in the
land of Midian, where his two sons were
born.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
41
30 "Forty years later, in the desert near
Mount Sinai, an angel appeared to
Moses in the ﬂame of a burning bush.
31 Moses saw it and wondered what it
was. As he went to see, the voice of the
Lord called out to him,
32 ‘I am the God of your ancestors––the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’
Moses shook with terror and dared not
look.
33 "And the Lord said to him, ‘Take oﬀ
your sandals, for you are standing on
holy ground.
34 You can be sure that I have seen the
misery of my people in Egypt. I have
heard their cries. So I have come to
rescue them. Now go, for I will send you
to Egypt.’
35 And so God sent back the same man
his people had previously rejected by
demanding, ‘Who made you a ruler and
judge over us?’ Through the angel whoACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
42
appeared to him in the burning bush,
Moses was sent to be their ruler and
savior.
36 And by means of many miraculous
signs and wonders, he led them out of
Egypt, through the Red Sea, and back
and forth through the wilderness for
forty years.
37 "Moses himself told the people of
Israel, ‘God will raise up a Prophet like
me from among your own people.’
38 Moses was with the assembly of
God’s people in the wilderness. He
was the mediator between the people
of Israel and the angel who gave him
life–giving words on Mount Sinai to pass
on to us.
39 "But our ancestors rejected Moses
and wanted to return to Egypt.
40 They told Aaron, ‘Make us some gods
who can lead us, for we don’t know whatACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
43
has become of this Moses, who brought
us out of Egypt.’
41 So they made an idol shaped like a
calf, and they sacriﬁced to it and rejoiced
in this thing they had made.
42 Then God turned away from them
and gave them up to serve the sun,
moon, and stars as their gods! In the
book of the prophets it is wri en, ‘Was it
to me you were bringing sacriﬁces during
those forty years in the wilderness,
Israel?
43 No, your real interest was in your
pagan gods––the shrine of Molech, the
star god Rephan, and the images you
made to worship them. So I will send
you into cap vity far away in Babylon.’
44 "Our ancestors carried the Tabernacle
with them through the wilderness. It
was constructed in exact accordance
with the plan shown to Moses by God.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
44
45 Years later, when Joshua led the
ba les against the Gen le na ons
that God drove out of this land, the
Tabernacle was taken with them into
their new territory. And it was used
there un l the me of King David.
46 "David found favor with God and
asked for the privilege of building a
permanent Temple for the God of Jacob.
47 But it was Solomon who actually built
it.
48 However, the Most High doesn’t live
in temples made by human hands. As
the prophet says,
49 ‘Heaven is my throne, and the earth
is my footstool. Could you ever build me
a temple as good as that?’ asks the Lord.
‘Could you build a dwelling place for me?
50 Didn’t I make everything in heaven
and earth?’
51 "You stubborn people! You are
heathen at heart and deaf to the truth.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
45
Must you forever resist the Holy Spirit?
But your ancestors did, and so do you!
52 Name one prophet your ancestors
didn’t persecute! They even killed the
ones who predicted the coming of the
Righteous One––the Messiah whom you
betrayed and murdered.
53 You deliberately disobeyed God’s law,
though you received it from the hands
of angels."
54 The Jewish leaders were infuriated
by Stephen’s accusa on, and they shook
their ﬁsts in rage.
55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit,
gazed steadily upward into heaven and
saw the glory of God, and he saw Jesus
standing in the place of honor at God’s
right hand.
56 And he told them, "Look, I see the
heavens opened and the Son of Man
standing in the place of honor at God’s
right hand!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7 – 8
46
57 Then they put their hands over their
ears, and drowning out his voice with
their shouts, they rushed at him.
58 They dragged him out of the city
and began to stone him. The oﬃcial
witnesses took oﬀ their coats and laid
them at the feet of a young man named
Saul.
59 And as they stoned him, Stephen
prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
60 And he fell to his knees, shou ng,
"Lord, don’t charge them with this sin!"
And with that, he died.
1 Saul was one of the oﬃcial
witnesses at the killing of Stephen.
A great wave of persecu on began
that day, sweeping over the church in
Jerusalem, and all the believers except
the apostles ﬂed into Judea and Samaria.
2 (Some godly men came and buried
Stephen with loud weeping.)
8ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
47
3 Saul was going everywhere to
devastate the church. He went from
house to house, dragging out both men
and women to throw them into jail.
4 But the believers who had ﬂed
Jerusalem went everywhere preaching
the Good News about Jesus.
5 Philip, for example, went to the city of
Samaria and told the people there about
the Messiah.
6 Crowds listened intently to what he
had to say because of the miracles he
did.
7 Many evil spirits were cast out,
screaming as they le their vic ms. And
many who had been paralyzed or lame
were healed.
8 So there was great joy in that city.
9 A man named Simon had been a
sorcerer there for many years, claiming
to be someone great.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
48
10 The Samaritan people, from the least
to the greatest, o en spoke of him as
"the Great One––the Power of God."
11 He was very inﬂuen al because of
the magic he performed.
12 But now the people believed Philip’s
message of Good News concerning
the Kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ. As a result, many men and
women were bap zed.
13 Then Simon himself believed and
was bap zed. He began following Philip
wherever he went, and he was amazed
by the great miracles and signs Philip
performed.
14 When the apostles back in Jerusalem
heard that the people of Samaria had
accepted God’s message, they sent Peter
and John there.
15 As soon as they arrived, they prayed
for these new Chris ans to receive the
Holy Spirit.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
49
16 The Holy Spirit had not yet come
upon any of them, for they had only
been bap zed in the name of the Lord
Jesus.
17 Then Peter and John laid their hands
upon these believers, and they received
the Holy Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit
was given when the apostles placed
their hands upon people’s heads, he
oﬀered money to buy this power.
19 "Let me have this power, too," he
exclaimed, "so that when I lay my hands
on people, they will receive the Holy
Spirit!"
20 But Peter replied, "May your money
perish with you for thinking God’s gi
can be bought!
21 You can have no part in this, for your
heart is not right before God.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
50
22 Turn from your wickedness and pray
to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your
evil thoughts,
23 for I can see that you are full of
bi erness and held cap ve by sin."
24 "Pray to the Lord for me," Simon
exclaimed, "that these terrible things
won’t happen to me!"
25 A er tes fying and preaching the
word of the Lord in Samaria, Peter and
John returned to Jerusalem. And they
stopped in many Samaritan villages
along the way to preach the Good News
to them, too.
26 As for Philip, an angel of the Lord said
to him, "Go south down the desert road
that runs from Jerusalem to Gaza."
27 So he did, and he met the treasurer
of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority
under the queen of Ethiopia. The eunuch
had gone to Jerusalem to worship,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
51
28 and he was now returning. Seated in
his carriage, he was reading aloud from
the book of the prophet Isaiah.
29 The Holy Spirit said to Philip, "Go over
and walk along beside the carriage."
30 Philip ran over and heard the man
reading from the prophet Isaiah; so he
asked, "Do you understand what you are
reading?"
31 The man replied, "How can I, when
there is no one to instruct me?" And
he begged Philip to come up into the
carriage and sit with him.
32 The passage of Scripture he had been
reading was this: "He was led as a sheep
to the slaughter. And as a lamb is silent
before the shearers, he did not open his
mouth.
33 He was humiliated and received
no jus ce. Who can speak of his
descendants? For his life was taken from
the earth."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
52
34 The eunuch asked Philip, "Was Isaiah
talking about himself or someone else?"
35 So Philip began with this same
Scripture and then used many others to
tell him the Good News about Jesus.
36 As they rode along, they came to
some water, and the eunuch said, "Look!
There’s some water! Why can’t I be
bap zed?"
37 [[EMPTY]]
38 He ordered the carriage to stop, and
they went down into the water, and
Philip bap zed him.
39 When they came up out of the water,
the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away.
The eunuch never saw him again but
went on his way rejoicing.
40 Meanwhile, Philip found himself
farther north at the city of Azotus! He
preached the Good News there and in
every city along the way un l he came to
Caesarea.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
1 Meanwhile, Saul was u
53
ering
threats with every breath. He was
eager to destroy the Lord’s followers, so
he went to the high priest.
2 He requested le ers addressed to
the synagogues in Damascus, asking
their coopera on in the arrest of any
followers of the Way he found there. He
wanted to bring them––both men and
women––back to Jerusalem in chains.
3 As he was nearing Damascus on this
mission, a brilliant light from heaven
suddenly beamed down upon him!
4 He fell to the ground and heard a
voice saying to him, "Saul! Saul! Why are
you persecu ng me?"
5 "Who are you, sir?" Saul asked. And
the voice replied, "I am Jesus, the one
you are persecu ng!
6 Now get up and go into the city, and
you will be told what you are to do."
9ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
54
7 The men with Saul stood speechless
with surprise, for they heard the sound
of someone’s voice, but they saw no
one!
8 As Saul picked himself up oﬀ the
ground, he found that he was blind.
9 So his companions led him by the
hand to Damascus. He remained there
blind for three days. And all that me he
went without food and water.
10 Now there was a believer in
Damascus named Ananias. The Lord
spoke to him in a vision, calling,
"Ananias!" "Yes, Lord!" he replied.
11 The Lord said, "Go over to Straight
Street, to the house of Judas. When
you arrive, ask for Saul of Tarsus. He is
praying to me right now.
12 I have shown him a vision of a man
named Ananias coming in and laying his
hands on him so that he can see again."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
55
13 "But Lord," exclaimed Ananias, "I’ve
heard about the terrible things this man
has done to the believers in Jerusalem!
14 And we hear that he is authorized
by the leading priests to arrest every
believer in Damascus."
15 But the Lord said, "Go and do what I
say. For Saul is my chosen instrument to
take my message to the Gen les and to
kings, as well as to the people of Israel.
16 And I will show him how much he
must suﬀer for me."
17 So Ananias went and found Saul. He
laid his hands on him and said, "Brother
Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to
you on the road, has sent me so that
you may get your sight back and be ﬁlled
with the Holy Spirit."
18 Instantly something like scales fell
from Saul’s eyes, and he regained his
sight. Then he got up and was bap zed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
19 A
56
erward he ate some food and
was strengthened. Saul stayed with the
believers in Damascus for a few days.
20 And immediately he began preaching
about Jesus in the synagogues, saying,
"He is indeed the Son of God!"
21 All who heard him were amazed.
"Isn’t this the same man who persecuted
Jesus’ followers with such devasta on
in Jerusalem?" they asked. "And we
understand that he came here to arrest
them and take them in chains to the
leading priests."
22 Saul’s preaching became more
and more powerful, and the Jews in
Damascus couldn’t refute his proofs that
Jesus was indeed the Messiah.
23 A er a while the Jewish leaders
decided to kill him.
24 But Saul was told about their plot,
and that they were watching for him dayACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
57
and night at the city gate so they could
murder him.
25 So during the night, some of the
other believers let him down in a large
basket through an opening in the city
wall.
26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he
tried to meet with the believers, but
they were all afraid of him. They thought
he was only pretending to be a believer!
27 Then Barnabas brought him to the
apostles and told them how Saul had
seen the Lord on the way to Damascus.
Barnabas also told them what the Lord
had said to Saul and how he boldly
preached in the name of Jesus in
Damascus.
28 Then the apostles accepted Saul, and
a er that he was constantly with them
in Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the
name of the Lord.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
58
29 He debated with some Greek–
speaking Jews, but they plo ed to
murder him.
30 When the believers heard about it,
however, they took him to Caesarea and
sent him on to his hometown of Tarsus.
31 The church then had peace
throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria,
and it grew in strength and numbers.
The believers were walking in the fear of
the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy
Spirit.
32 Peter traveled from place to place to
visit the believers, and in his travels he
came to the Lord’s people in the town of
Lydda.
33 There he met a man named Aeneas,
who had been paralyzed and bedridden
for eight years.
34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus
Christ heals you! Get up and make your
bed!" And he was healed instantly.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
35 Then the whole popula
59
on of Lydda
and Sharon turned to the Lord when
they saw Aeneas walking around.
36 There was a believer in Joppa named
Tabitha (which in Greek is Dorcas). She
was always doing kind things for others
and helping the poor.
37 About this me she became ill and
died. Her friends prepared her for burial
and laid her in an upstairs room.
38 But they had heard that Peter was
nearby at Lydda, so they sent two men
to beg him, "Please come as soon as
possible!"
39 So Peter returned with them; and
as soon as he arrived, they took him
to the upstairs room. The room was
ﬁlled with widows who were weeping
and showing him the coats and other
garments Dorcas had made for them.
40 But Peter asked them all to leave the
room; then he knelt and prayed. TurningACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9 – 10
60
to the body he said, "Get up, Tabitha."
And she opened her eyes! When she
saw Peter, she sat up!
41 He gave her his hand and helped her
up. Then he called in the widows and all
the believers, and he showed them that
she was alive.
42 The news raced through the whole
town, and many believed in the Lord.
43 And Peter stayed a long me in Joppa,
living with Simon, a leatherworker.
1 In Caesarea there lived a Roman
army oﬃcer named Cornelius,
who was a captain of the Italian
Regiment.
2 He was a devout man who feared the
God of Israel, as did his en re household.
He gave generously to charity and was a
man who regularly prayed to God.
3 One a ernoon about three o’clock, he
had a vision in which he saw an angel of
10ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
61
God coming toward him. "Cornelius!"
the angel said.
4 Cornelius stared at him in terror.
"What is it, sir?" he asked the angel. And
the angel replied, "Your prayers and gi s
to the poor have not gone unno ced by
God!
5 Now send some men down to Joppa
to ﬁnd a man named Simon Peter.
6 He is staying with Simon, a
leatherworker who lives near the shore.
Ask him to come and visit you."
7 As soon as the angel was gone,
Cornelius called two of his household
servants and a devout soldier, one of his
personal a endants.
8 He told them what had happened and
sent them oﬀ to Joppa.
9 The next day as Cornelius’s
messengers were nearing the city,
Peter went up to the ﬂat roof to pray. It
was about noon,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
62
10 and he was hungry. But while lunch
was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
11 He saw the sky open, and something
like a large sheet was let down by its four
corners.
12 In the sheet were all sorts of animals,
rep les, and birds.
13 Then a voice said to him, "Get up,
Peter; kill and eat them."
14 "Never, Lord," Peter declared. "I
have never in all my life eaten anything
forbidden by our Jewish laws."
15 The voice spoke again, "If God says
something is acceptable, don’t say it
isn’t."
16 The same vision was repeated three
mes. Then the sheet was pulled up
again to heaven.
17 Peter was very perplexed. What
could the vision mean? Just then the
men sent by Cornelius found the house
and stood outside at the gate.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
63
18 They asked if this was the place
where Simon Peter was staying.
19 Meanwhile, as Peter was puzzling
over the vision, the Holy Spirit said to
him, "Three men have come looking for
you.
20 Go down and go with them without
hesita on. All is well, for I have sent
them."
21 So Peter went down and said, "I’m
the man you are looking for. Why have
you come?"
22 They said, "We were sent by
Cornelius, a Roman oﬃcer. He is a
devout man who fears the God of Israel
and is well respected by all the Jews. A
holy angel instructed him to send for you
so you can go to his house and give him
a message."
23 So Peter invited the men to be his
guests for the night. The next day heACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
64
went with them, accompanied by some
other believers from Joppa.
24 They arrived in Caesarea the
following day. Cornelius was wai ng for
him and had called together his rela ves
and close friends to meet Peter.
25 As Peter entered his home, Cornelius
fell to the ﬂoor before him in worship.
26 But Peter pulled him up and said,
"Stand up! I’m a human being like you!"
27 So Cornelius got up, and they talked
together and went inside where the
others were assembled.
28 Peter told them, "You know it is
against the Jewish laws for me to come
into a Gen le home like this. But God
has shown me that I should never think
of anyone as impure.
29 So I came as soon as I was sent for.
Now tell me why you sent for me."
30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago I
was praying in my house at three o’clockACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
65
in the a ernoon. Suddenly, a man in
dazzling clothes was standing in front of
me.
31 He told me, ‘Cornelius, your prayers
have been heard, and your gi s to the
poor have been no ced by God!
32 Now send some men to Joppa and
summon Simon Peter. He is staying in
the home of Simon, a leatherworker
who lives near the shore.’
33 So I sent for you at once, and it was
good of you to come. Now here we are,
wai ng before God to hear the message
the Lord has given you."
34 Then Peter replied, "I see very clearly
that God doesn’t show par ality.
35 In every na on he accepts those who
fear him and do what is right.
36 I’m sure you have heard about
the Good News for the people of
Israel––that there is peace with God
through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
66
37 You know what happened all through
Judea, beginning in Galilee a er John
the Bap st began preaching.
38 And no doubt you know that God
anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
Spirit and with power. Then Jesus went
around doing good and healing all who
were oppressed by the Devil, for God
was with him.
39 "And we apostles are witnesses
of all he did throughout Israel and in
Jerusalem. They put him to death by
crucifying him,
40 but God raised him to life three days
later. Then God allowed him to appear,
41 not to the general public, but to us
whom God had chosen beforehand to be
his witnesses. We were those who ate
and drank with him a er he rose from
the dead.
42 And he ordered us to preach
everywhere and to tes fy that JesusACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
67
is ordained of God to be the judge of
all––the living and the dead.
43 He is the one all the prophets
tes ﬁed about, saying that everyone
who believes in him will have their sins
forgiven through his name."
44 Even as Peter was saying these
things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who
had heard the message.
45 The Jewish believers who came with
Peter were amazed that the gi of the
Holy Spirit had been poured out upon
the Gen les, too.
46 And there could be no doubt about it,
for they heard them speaking in tongues
and praising God. Then Peter asked,
47 "Can anyone object to their being
bap zed, now that they have received
the Holy Spirit just as we did?"
48 So he gave orders for them to be
bap zed in the name of Jesus Christ.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
68
A erward Cornelius asked him to stay
with them for several days.
1 Soon the news reached the
apostles and other believers in
Judea that the Gen les had received the
word of God.
2 But when Peter arrived back in
Jerusalem, some of the Jewish believers
cri cized him.
3 "You entered the home of Gen les
and even ate with them!" they said.
4 Then Peter told them exactly what
had happened.
5 "One day in Joppa," he said, "while I
was praying, I went into a trance and saw
a vision. Something like a large sheet
was let down by its four corners from
the sky. And it came right down to me.
6 When I looked inside the sheet, I saw
all sorts of small animals, wild animals,
rep les, and birds that we are not
allowed to eat.
11ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
69
7 And I heard a voice say, ‘Get up, Peter;
kill and eat them.’
8 "‘Never, Lord,’ I replied. ‘I have never
eaten anything forbidden by our Jewish
laws.’
9 "But the voice from heaven came
again, ‘If God says something is
acceptable, don’t say it isn’t.’
10 "This happened three mes before
the sheet and all it contained was pulled
back up to heaven.
11 Just then three men who had been
sent from Caesarea arrived at the house
where I was staying.
12 The Holy Spirit told me to go with
them and not to worry about their
being Gen les. These six brothers here
accompanied me, and we soon arrived
at the home of the man who had sent
for us.
13 He told us how an angel had
appeared to him in his home and hadACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
70
told him, ‘Send messengers to Joppa to
ﬁnd Simon Peter.
14 He will tell you how you and all your
household will be saved!’
15 "Well, I began telling them the Good
News, but just as I was ge ng started,
the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as he fell
on us at the beginning.
16 Then I thought of the Lord’s words
when he said, ‘John bap zed with water,
but you will be bap zed with the Holy
Spirit.’
17 And since God gave these Gen les
the same gi he gave us when we
believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who
was I to argue?"
18 When the others heard this, all their
objec ons were answered and they
began praising God. They said, "God has
also given the Gen les the privilege of
turning from sin and receiving eternal
life."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
71
19 Meanwhile, the believers who
had ﬂed from Jerusalem during the
persecu on a er Stephen’s death
traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus,
and An och of Syria. They preached the
Good News, but only to Jews.
20 However, some of the believers who
went to An och from Cyprus and Cyrene
began preaching to Gen les about the
Lord Jesus.
21 The power of the Lord was upon
them, and large numbers of these
Gen les believed and turned to the Lord.
22 When the church at Jerusalem heard
what had happened, they sent Barnabas
to An och.
23 When he arrived and saw this proof
of God’s favor, he was ﬁlled with joy, and
he encouraged the believers to stay true
to the Lord.
24 Barnabas was a good man, full of the
Holy Spirit and strong in faith. And largeACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
72
numbers of people were brought to the
Lord.
25 Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to
ﬁnd Saul.
26 When he found him, he brought him
back to An och. Both of them stayed
there with the church for a full year,
teaching great numbers of people. (It
was there at An och that the believers
were ﬁrst called Chris ans.)
27 During this me, some prophets
traveled from Jerusalem to An och.
28 One of them named Agabus stood up
in one of the mee ngs to predict by the
Spirit that a great famine was coming
upon the en re Roman world. (This was
fulﬁlled during the reign of Claudius.)
29 So the believers in An och decided
to send relief to the brothers and sisters
in Judea, everyone giving as much as
they could.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11 – 12 73
30 This they did, entrus
ng their gi s to
Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders
of the church in Jerusalem.
1 About that me King Herod
Agrippa began to persecute some
believers in the church.
2 He had the apostle James (John’s
brother) killed with a sword.
3 When Herod saw how much this
pleased the Jewish leaders, he arrested
Peter during the Passover celebra on
4 and imprisoned him, placing him
under the guard of four squads of four
soldiers each. Herod’s inten on was to
bring Peter out for public trial a er the
Passover.
5 But while Peter was in prison, the
church prayed very earnestly for him.
6 The night before Peter was to be
placed on trial, he was asleep, chained
between two soldiers, with others
standing guard at the prison gate.
12ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
74
7 Suddenly, there was a bright light in
the cell, and an angel of the Lord stood
before Peter. The angel tapped him on
the side to awaken him and said, "Quick!
Get up!" And the chains fell oﬀ his wrists.
8 Then the angel told him, "Get dressed
and put on your sandals." And he did.
"Now put on your coat and follow me,"
the angel ordered.
9 So Peter le the cell, following the
angel. But all the me he thought it was
a vision. He didn’t realize it was really
happening.
10 They passed the ﬁrst and second
guard posts and came to the iron gate
to the street, and this opened to them
all by itself. So they passed through and
started walking down the street, and
then the angel suddenly le him.
11 Peter ﬁnally realized what had
happened. "It’s really true!" he said to
himself. "The Lord has sent his angel andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
75
saved me from Herod and from what the
Jews were hoping to do to me!"
12 A er a li le thought, he went to the
home of Mary, the mother of John Mark,
where many were gathered for prayer.
13 He knocked at the door in the gate,
and a servant girl named Rhoda came to
open it.
14 When she recognized Peter’s voice,
she was so overjoyed that, instead of
opening the door, she ran back inside
and told everyone, "Peter is standing at
the door!"
15 "You’re out of your mind," they said.
When she insisted, they decided, "It
must be his angel."
16 Meanwhile, Peter con nued
knocking. When they ﬁnally went out
and opened the door, they were amazed.
17 He mo oned for them to quiet down
and told them what had happened and
how the Lord had led him out of jail.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
76
"Tell James and the other brothers what
happened," he said. And then he went
to another place.
18 At dawn, there was a great
commo on among the soldiers about
what had happened to Peter.
19 Herod Agrippa ordered a thorough
search for him. When he couldn’t be
found, Herod interrogated the guards
and sentenced them to death. A erward
Herod le Judea to stay in Caesarea for a
while.
20 Now Herod was very angry with the
people of Tyre and Sidon. So they sent
a delega on to make peace with him
because their ci es were dependent
upon Herod’s country for their food.
They made friends with Blastus, Herod’s
personal assistant,
21 and an appointment with Herod was
granted. When the day arrived, HerodACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12 – 13 77
put on his royal robes, sat on his throne,
and made a speech to them.
22 The people gave him a great ova on,
shou ng, "It is the voice of a god, not of
a man!"
23 Instantly, an angel of the Lord struck
Herod with a sickness, because he
accepted the people’s worship instead
of giving the glory to God. So he was
consumed with worms and died.
24 But God’s Good News was spreading
rapidly, and there were many new
believers.
25 When Barnabas and Saul had ﬁnished
their mission in Jerusalem, they returned
to An och, taking John Mark with them.
1 Among the prophets and
teachers of the church at An och
of Syria were Barnabas, Simeon (called
"the black man"), Lucius (from Cyrene),
Manaen (the childhood companion of
King Herod An pas), and Saul.

2 One day as these men were
worshiping the Lord and fas ng, the Holy
Spirit said, "Dedicate Barnabas and Saul
for the special work I have for them."
3 So a er more fas ng and prayer, the
men laid their hands on them and sent
them on their way.
4 Sent out by the Holy Spirit, Saul and
Barnabas went down to the seaport of
Seleucia and then sailed for the island of
Cyprus.
5 There, in the town of Salamis, they
went to the Jewish synagogues and
preached the word of God. (John Mark
went with them as their assistant.)
6 A erward they preached from town
to town across the en re island un l
ﬁnally they reached Paphos, where they
met a Jewish sorcerer, a false prophet
named Bar–Jesus.
7 He had a ached himself to the
governor, Sergius Paulus, a man ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
79
considerable insight and understanding.
The governor invited Barnabas and Saul
to visit him, for he wanted to hear the
word of God.
8 But Elymas, the sorcerer (as his name
means in Greek), interfered and urged
the governor to pay no a en on to what
Saul and Barnabas said. He was trying
to turn the governor away from the
Chris an faith.
9 Then Saul, also known as Paul, ﬁlled
with the Holy Spirit, looked the sorcerer
in the eye and said,
10 "You son of the Devil, full of every
sort of trickery and villainy, enemy of
all that is good, will you never stop
perver ng the true ways of the Lord?
11 And now the Lord has laid his hand
of punishment upon you, and you will be
stricken awhile with blindness." Instantly
mist and darkness fell upon him, and heACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
80
began wandering around begging for
someone to take his hand and lead him.
12 When the governor saw what
had happened, he believed and was
astonished at what he learned about the
Lord.
13 Now Paul and those with him
le Paphos by ship for Pamphylia,*
landing at the port town of Perga. There
John Mark le them and returned to
Jerusalem.
14 But Barnabas and Paul traveled
inland to An och of Pisidia. On the
Sabbath they went to the synagogue for
the services.
15 A er the usual readings from the
books of Moses and from the Prophets,
those in charge of the service sent them
this message: "Brothers, if you have any
word of encouragement for us, come
and give it!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
16 So Paul stood, li
81
ed his hand to quiet
them, and started speaking. "People of
Israel," he said, "and you devout Gen les
who fear the God of Israel, listen to me.
17 "The God of this na on of Israel
chose our ancestors and made them
prosper in Egypt. Then he powerfully led
them out of their slavery.
18 He put up with them through forty
years of wandering around in the
wilderness.
19 Then he destroyed seven na ons in
Canaan and gave their land to Israel as
an inheritance.
20 All this took about 450 years. A er
that, judges ruled un l the me of
Samuel the prophet.
21 Then the people begged for a king,
and God gave them Saul son of Kish,
a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who
reigned for forty years.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
82
22 But God removed him from the
kingship and replaced him with David, a
man about whom God said, ‘David son
of Jesse is a man a er my own heart, for
he will do everything I want him to.’
23 "And it is one of King David’s
descendants, Jesus, who is God’s
promised Savior of Israel!
24 But before he came, John the Bap st
preached the need for everyone in Israel
to turn from sin and turn to God and be
bap zed.
25 As John was ﬁnishing his ministry he
asked, ‘Do you think I am the Messiah?
No! But he is coming soon––and I am
not even worthy to be his slave.’
26 "Brothers––you sons of Abraham,
and also all of you devout Gen les who
fear the God of Israel––this salva on is
for us!
27 The people in Jerusalem and
their leaders fulﬁlled prophecy byACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
83
condemning Jesus to death. They didn’t
recognize him or realize that he is the
one the prophets had wri en about,
though they hear the prophets’ words
read every Sabbath.
28 They found no just cause to execute
him, but they asked Pilate to have him
killed anyway.
29 "When they had fulﬁlled all the
prophecies concerning his death, they
took him down from the cross and
placed him in a tomb.
30 But God raised him from the dead!
31 And he appeared over a period of
many days to those who had gone with
him from Galilee to Jerusalem––these
are his witnesses to the people of Israel.
32 "And now Barnabas and I are here
to bring you this Good News. God’s
promise to our ancestors has come true
in our own me,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
84
33 in that God raised Jesus. This is what
the second psalm is talking about when
it says concerning Jesus, ‘You are my
Son. Today I have become your Father.’
34 For God had promised to raise him
from the dead, never again to die. This
is stated in the Scripture that says, ‘I will
give you the sacred blessings I promised
to David.’
35 Another psalm explains more fully,
saying, ‘You will not allow your Holy One
to rot in the grave.’
36 Now this is not a reference to David,
for a er David had served his genera on
according to the will of God, he died and
was buried, and his body decayed.
37 No, it was a reference to someone
else––someone whom God raised and
whose body did not decay.
38 "Brothers, listen! In this man Jesus
there is forgiveness for your sins.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
85
39 Everyone who believes in him is freed
from all guilt and declared right with
God––something the Jewish law could
never do.
40 Be careful! Don’t let the prophets’
words apply to you. For they said,
41 ‘Look, you mockers, be amazed
and die! For I am doing something in
your own day, something you wouldn’t
believe even if someone told you about
it.’"
42 As Paul and Barnabas le the
synagogue that day, the people asked
them to return again and speak about
these things the next week.
43 Many Jews and godly converts
to Judaism who worshiped at the
synagogue followed Paul and Barnabas,
and the two men urged them, "By God’s
grace, remain faithful."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
44 The following week almost the en
86
re
city turned out to hear them preach the
word of the Lord.
45 But when the Jewish leaders saw
the crowds, they were jealous; so they
slandered Paul and argued against
whatever he said.
46 Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out
boldly and declared, "It was necessary
that this Good News from God be
given ﬁrst to you Jews. But since you
have rejected it and judged yourselves
unworthy of eternal life––well, we will
oﬀer it to Gen les.
47 For this is as the Lord commanded us
when he said, ‘I have made you a light
to the Gen les, to bring salva on to the
farthest corners of the earth.’"
48 When the Gen les heard this, they
were very glad and thanked the Lord for
his message; and all who were appointed
to eternal life became believers.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13 – 14 87
49 So the Lord’s message spread
throughout that region.
50 Then the Jewish leaders s rred up
both the inﬂuen al religious women and
the leaders of the city, and they incited a
mob against Paul and Barnabas and ran
them out of town.
51 But they shook oﬀ the dust of their
feet against them and went to the city of
Iconium.
52 And the believers were ﬁlled with joy
and with the Holy Spirit.
1 In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas
went together to the synagogue
and preached with such power that a
great number of both Jews and Gen les
believed.
2 But the Jews who spurned God’s
message s rred up distrust among the
Gen les against Paul and Barnabas,
saying all sorts of evil things about them.
14ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
3 The apostles stayed there a long
88
me,
preaching boldly about the grace of the
Lord. The Lord proved their message
was true by giving them power to do
miraculous signs and wonders.
4 But the people of the city were
divided in their opinion about them.
Some sided with the Jews, and some
with the apostles.
5 A mob of Gen les and Jews, along
with their leaders, decided to a ack and
stone them.
6 When the apostles learned of it, they
ﬂed for their lives. They went to the
region of Lycaonia, to the ci es of Lystra
and Derbe and the surrounding area,
7 and they preached the Good News
there.
8 While they were at Lystra, Paul
and Barnabas came upon a man with
crippled feet. He had been that way
from birth, so he had never walked.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
89
9 He was listening as Paul preached,
and Paul no ced him and realized he
had faith to be healed.
10 So Paul called to him in a loud voice,
"Stand up!" And the man jumped to his
feet and started walking.
11 When the listening crowd saw what
Paul had done, they shouted in their
local dialect, "These men are gods in
human bodies!"
12 They decided that Barnabas was the
Greek god Zeus and that Paul, because
he was the chief speaker, was Hermes.
13 The temple of Zeus was located on
the outskirts of the city. The priest of the
temple and the crowd brought oxen and
wreaths of ﬂowers, and they prepared to
sacriﬁce to the apostles at the city gates.
14 But when Barnabas and Paul heard
what was happening, they tore their
clothing in dismay and ran out among
the people, shou ng,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
90
15 "Friends, why are you doing this?
We are merely human beings like
yourselves! We have come to bring you
the Good News that you should turn
from these worthless things to the living
God, who made heaven and earth, the
sea, and everything in them.
16 In earlier days he permi ed all the
na ons to go their own ways,
17 but he never le himself without
a witness. There were always his
reminders, such as sending you rain and
good crops and giving you food and
joyful hearts."
18 But even so, Paul and Barnabas
could scarcely restrain the people from
sacriﬁcing to them.
19 Now some Jews arrived from An och
and Iconium and turned the crowds into
a murderous mob. They stoned Paul and
dragged him out of the city, apparently
dead.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
91
20 But as the believers stood around
him, he got up and went back into the
city. The next day he le with Barnabas
for Derbe.
21 A er preaching the Good News in
Derbe and making many disciples, Paul
and Barnabas returned again to Lystra,
Iconium, and An och of Pisidia,
22 where they strengthened the
believers. They encouraged them to
con nue in the faith, reminding them
that they must enter into the Kingdom
of God through many tribula ons.
23 Paul and Barnabas also appointed
elders in every church and prayed for
them with fas ng, turning them over to
the care of the Lord, in whom they had
come to trust.
24 Then they traveled back through
Pisidia to Pamphylia.
25 They preached again in Perga, then
went on to A alia.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14 – 15 92
26 Finally, they returned by ship to
An och of Syria, where their journey
had begun and where they had been
commi ed to the grace of God for the
work they had now completed.
27 Upon arriving in An och, they called
the church together and reported about
their trip, telling all that God had done
and how he had opened the door of
faith to the Gen les, too.
28 And they stayed there with the
believers in An och for a long me.
1 While Paul and Barnabas were
at An och of Syria, some men
from Judea arrived and began to teach
the Chris ans: "Unless you keep the
ancient Jewish custom of circumcision
taught by Moses, you cannot be saved."
2 Paul and Barnabas, disagreeing with
them, argued forcefully and at length.
Finally, Paul and Barnabas were sent to
Jerusalem, accompanied by some local
15ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
93
believers, to talk to the apostles and
elders about this ques on.
3 The church sent the delegates to
Jerusalem, and they stopped along the
way in Phoenicia and Samaria to visit
the believers. They told them––much to
everyone’s joy––that the Gen les, too,
were being converted.
4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, Paul
and Barnabas were welcomed by the
whole church, including the apostles and
elders. They reported on what God had
been doing through their ministry.
5 But then some of the men who had
been Pharisees before their conversion
stood up and declared that all Gen le
converts must be circumcised and be
required to follow the law of Moses.
6 So the apostles and church elders got
together to decide this ques on.
7 At the mee ng, a er a long discussion,
Peter stood and addressed them asACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
94
follows: "Brothers, you all know that
God chose me from among you some
me ago to preach to the Gen les so
that they could hear the Good News and
believe.
8 God, who knows people’s hearts,
conﬁrmed that he accepts Gen les by
giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he
gave him to us.
9 He made no dis nc on between us
and them, for he also cleansed their
hearts through faith.
10 Why are you now ques oning God’s
way by burdening the Gen le believers
with a yoke that neither we nor our
ancestors were able to bear?
11 We believe that we are all saved the
same way, by the special favor of the
Lord Jesus."
12 There was no further discussion, and
everyone listened as Barnabas and Paul
told about the miraculous signs andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
95
wonders God had done through them
among the Gen les.
13 When they had ﬁnished, James stood
and said, "Brothers, listen to me.
14 Peter has told you about the me
God ﬁrst visited the Gen les to take
from them a people for himself.
15 And this conversion of Gen les
agrees with what the prophets
predicted. For instance, it is wri en:
16 ‘A erward I will return, and I will
restore the fallen kingdom of David.
From the ruins I will rebuild it, and I will
restore it,
17 so that the rest of humanity might
ﬁnd the Lord, including the Gen les––all
those I have called to be mine. This is
what the Lord says,
18 he who made these things known
long ago.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
96
19 And so my judgment is that we
should stop troubling the Gen les who
turn to God,
20 except that we should write to them
and tell them to abstain from ea ng
meat sacriﬁced to idols, from sexual
immorality, and from consuming blood
or ea ng the meat of strangled animals.
21 For these laws of Moses have been
preached in Jewish synagogues in
every city on every Sabbath for many
genera ons."
22 Then the apostles and elders and
the whole church in Jerusalem chose
delegates, and they sent them to An och
of Syria with Paul and Barnabas to report
on this decision. The men chosen were
two of the church leaders ––Judas (also
called Barsabbas) and Silas.
23 This is the le er they took along with
them: "This le er is from the apostles
and elders, your brothers in Jerusalem.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
97
It is wri en to the Gen le believers in
An och, Syria, and Cilicia. Gree ngs!
24 "We understand that some men from
here have troubled you and upset you
with their teaching, but they had no
such instruc ons from us.
25 So it seemed good to us, having
unanimously agreed on our decision, to
send you these oﬃcial representa ves,
along with our beloved Barnabas and
Paul,
26 who have risked their lives for the
sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27 So we are sending Judas and Silas
to tell you what we have decided
concerning your ques on.
28 "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit
and to us to lay no greater burden on
you than these requirements:
29 You must abstain from ea ng food
oﬀered to idols, from consuming blood
or ea ng the meat of strangled animals,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
98
and from sexual immorality. If you do
this, you will do well. Farewell."
30 The four messengers went at once
to An och, where they called a general
mee ng of the Chris ans and delivered
the le er.
31 And there was great joy throughout
the church that day as they read this
encouraging message.
32 Then Judas and Silas, both
being prophets, spoke extensively
to the Chris ans, encouraging and
strengthening their faith.
33 They stayed for a while, and then
Judas and Silas were sent back to
Jerusalem, with the blessings of the
Chris ans, to those who had sent them.
34 [[EMPTY]]
35 Paul and Barnabas stayed in An och
to assist many others who were teaching
and preaching the word of the Lord
there.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
36 A
99
er some me Paul said to
Barnabas, "Let’s return to each city
where we previously preached the
word of the Lord, to see how the new
believers are ge ng along."
37 Barnabas agreed and wanted to take
along John Mark.
38 But Paul disagreed strongly, since
John Mark had deserted them in
Pamphylia and had not shared in their
work.
39 Their disagreement over this was
so sharp that they separated. Barnabas
took John Mark with him and sailed for
Cyprus.
40 Paul chose Silas, and the believers
sent them oﬀ, entrus ng them to the
Lord’s grace.
41 So they traveled throughout Syria
and Cilicia to strengthen the churches
there.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
16
100
1 Paul and Silas went ﬁrst to
Derbe and then on to Lystra.
There they met Timothy, a young disciple
whose mother was a Jewish believer, but
whose father was a Greek.
2 Timothy was well thought of by the
believers in Lystra and Iconium,
3 so Paul wanted him to join them on
their journey. In deference to the Jews
of the area, he arranged for Timothy
to be circumcised before they le , for
everyone knew that his father was a
Greek.
4 Then they went from town to town,
explaining the decision regarding the
commandments that were to be obeyed,
as decided by the apostles and elders in
Jerusalem.
5 So the churches were strengthened in
their faith and grew daily in numbers.
6 Next Paul and Silas traveled through
the area of Phrygia and Gala a, becauseACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
101
the Holy Spirit had told them not to go
into the province of Asia at that me.
7 Then coming to the borders of Mysia,
they headed for the province of Bithynia,
but again the Spirit of Jesus did not let
them go.
8 So instead, they went on through
Mysia to the city of Troas.
9 That night Paul had a vision. He saw
a man from Macedonia in northern
Greece, pleading with him, "Come over
here and help us."
10 So we decided to leave for Macedonia
at once, for we could only conclude that
God was calling us to preach the Good
News there.
11 We boarded a boat at Troas and
sailed straight across to the island of
Samothrace, and the next day we landed
at Neapolis.
12 From there we reached Philippi, a
major city of the district of MacedoniaACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
102
and a Roman colony; we stayed there
several days.
13 On the Sabbath we went a li le way
outside the city to a riverbank, where
we supposed that some people met for
prayer, and we sat down to speak with
some women who had come together.
14 One of them was Lydia from Thya ra,
a merchant of expensive purple cloth.
She was a worshiper of God. As she
listened to us, the Lord opened her
heart, and she accepted what Paul was
saying.
15 She was bap zed along with other
members of her household, and she
asked us to be her guests. "If you agree
that I am faithful to the Lord," she said,
"come and stay at my home." And she
urged us un l we did.
16 One day as we were going down
to the place of prayer, we met a
demon–possessed slave girl. She wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
103
a fortune–teller who earned a lot of
money for her masters.
17 She followed along behind us
shou ng, "These men are servants of
the Most High God, and they have come
to tell you how to be saved."
18 This went on day a er day un l
Paul got so exasperated that he turned
and spoke to the demon within her.
"I command you in the name of Jesus
Christ to come out of her," he said. And
instantly it le her.
19 Her masters’ hopes of wealth were
now sha ered, so they grabbed Paul
and Silas and dragged them before the
authori es at the marketplace.
20 "The whole city is in an uproar
because of these Jews!" they shouted.
21 "They are teaching the people to do
things that are against Roman customs."
22 A mob quickly formed against Paul
and Silas, and the city oﬃcials orderedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
104
them stripped and beaten with wooden
rods.
23 They were severely beaten, and then
they were thrown into prison. The jailer
was ordered to make sure they didn’t
escape.
24 So he took no chances but put them
into the inner dungeon and clamped
their feet in the stocks.
25 Around midnight, Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns to God, and
the other prisoners were listening.
26 Suddenly, there was a great
earthquake, and the prison was shaken
to its founda ons. All the doors ﬂew
open, and the chains of every prisoner
fell oﬀ!
27 The jailer woke up to see the prison
doors wide open. He assumed the
prisoners had escaped, so he drew his
sword to kill himself.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
105
28 But Paul shouted to him, "Don’t do
it! We are all here!"
29 Trembling with fear, the jailer called
for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell
down before Paul and Silas.
30 He brought them out and asked,
"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
31 They replied, "Believe on the Lord
Jesus and you will be saved, along with
your en re household."
32 Then they shared the word of the
Lord with him and all who lived in his
household.
33 That same hour the jailer washed
their wounds, and he and everyone in his
household were immediately bap zed.
34 Then he brought them into his house
and set a meal before them. He and his
en re household rejoiced because they
all believed in God.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
106
35 The next morning the city oﬃcials
sent the police to tell the jailer, "Let
those men go!"
36 So the jailer told Paul, "You and Silas
are free to leave. Go in peace."
37 But Paul replied, "They have publicly
beaten us without trial and jailed
us––and we are Roman ci zens. So now
they want us to leave secretly? Certainly
not! Let them come themselves to
release us!"
38 When the police made their report,
the city oﬃcials were alarmed to learn
that Paul and Silas were Roman ci zens.
39 They came to the jail and apologized
to them. Then they brought them out
and begged them to leave the city.
40 Paul and Silas then returned to the
home of Lydia, where they met with the
believers and encouraged them once
more before leaving town.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
17
107
1 Now Paul and Silas traveled
through the towns of Amphipolis
and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica,
where there was a Jewish synagogue.
2 As was Paul’s custom, he went to
the synagogue service, and for three
Sabbaths in a row he interpreted the
Scriptures to the people.
3 He was explaining and proving the
prophecies about the suﬀerings of the
Messiah and his rising from the dead. He
said, "This Jesus I’m telling you about is
the Messiah."
4 Some who listened were persuaded
and became converts, including a large
number of godly Greek men and also
many important women of the city.
5 But the Jewish leaders were jealous,
so they gathered some worthless fellows
from the streets to form a mob and start
a riot. They a acked the home of Jason,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
108
searching for Paul and Silas so they could
drag them out to the crowd.
6 Not ﬁnding them there, they dragged
out Jason and some of the other
believers instead and took them before
the city council. "Paul and Silas have
turned the rest of the world upside
down, and now they are here disturbing
our city," they shouted.
7 "And Jason has let them into his home.
They are all guilty of treason against
Caesar, for they profess allegiance to
another king, Jesus."
8 The people of the city, as well as the
city oﬃcials, were thrown into turmoil
by these reports.
9 But the oﬃcials released Jason and
the other believers a er they had posted
bail.
10 That very night the believers
sent Paul and Silas to Berea. WhenACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
109
they arrived there, they went to the
synagogue.
11 And the people of Berea were
more open–minded than those in
Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly
to Paul’s message. They searched the
Scriptures day a er day to check up on
Paul and Silas, to see if they were really
teaching the truth.
12 As a result, many Jews believed,
as did some of the prominent Greek
women and many men.
13 But when some Jews in Thessalonica
learned that Paul was preaching the
word of God in Berea, they went there
and s rred up trouble.
14 The believers acted at once, sending
Paul on to the coast, while Silas and
Timothy remained behind.
15 Those escor ng Paul went with him
to Athens; then they returned to BereaACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
110
with a message for Silas and Timothy to
hurry and join him.
16 While Paul was wai ng for them in
Athens, he was deeply troubled by all
the idols he saw everywhere in the city.
17 He went to the synagogue to debate
with the Jews and the God–fearing
Gen les, and he spoke daily in the public
square to all who happened to be there.
18 He also had a debate with some of
the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers.
When he told them about Jesus and his
resurrec on, they said, "This babbler
has picked up some strange ideas."
Others said, "He’s pushing some foreign
religion."
19 Then they took him to the Council of
Philosophers. "Come and tell us more
about this new religion," they said.
20 "You are saying some rather startling
things, and we want to know what it’s all
about."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
111
21 (It should be explained that all the
Athenians as well as the foreigners in
Athens seemed to spend all their me
discussing the latest ideas.)
22 So Paul, standing before the Council,
addressed them as follows: "Men of
Athens, I no ce that you are very
religious,
23 for as I was walking along I saw your
many altars. And one of them had this
inscrip on on it––‘To an Unknown God.’
You have been worshiping him without
knowing who he is, and now I wish to
tell you about him.
24 "He is the God who made the world
and everything in it. Since he is Lord
of heaven and earth, he doesn’t live in
man–made temples,
25 and human hands can’t serve his
needs––for he has no needs. He himself
gives life and breath to everything, and
he sa sﬁes every need there is.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
112
26 From one man he created all the
na ons throughout the whole earth.
He decided beforehand which should
rise and fall, and he determined their
boundaries.
27 "His purpose in all of this was that
the na ons should seek a er God and
perhaps feel their way toward him and
ﬁnd him––though he is not far from any
one of us.
28 For in him we live and move and
exist. As one of your own poets says,
‘We are his oﬀspring.’
29 And since this is true, we shouldn’t
think of God as an idol designed by
cra smen from gold or silver or stone.
30 God overlooked people’s former
ignorance about these things, but now
he commands everyone everywhere to
turn away from idols and turn to him.
31 For he has set a day for judging the
world with jus ce by the man he hasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17 – 18 113
appointed, and he proved to everyone
who this is by raising him from the
dead."
32 When they heard Paul speak of the
resurrec on of a person who had been
dead, some laughed, but others said,
"We want to hear more about this later."
33 That ended Paul’s discussion with
them,
34 but some joined him and became
believers. Among them were Dionysius,
a member of the Council, a woman
named Damaris, and others.
1 Then Paul le Athens and went
to Corinth.
2 There he became acquainted with a
Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who
had recently arrived from Italy with his
wife, Priscilla. They had been expelled
from Italy as a result of Claudius Caesar’s
order to deport all Jews from Rome.

3 Paul lived and worked with them, for
they were tentmakers just as he was.
4 Each Sabbath found Paul at the
synagogue, trying to convince the Jews
and Greeks alike.
5 And a er Silas and Timothy came
down from Macedonia, Paul spent his
full me preaching and tes fying to the
Jews, telling them, "The Messiah you are
looking for is Jesus."
6 But when the Jews opposed him and
insulted him, Paul shook the dust from
his robe and said, "Your blood be upon
your own heads––I am innocent. From
now on I will go to the Gen les."
7 A er that he stayed with Ti us Justus,
a Gen le who worshiped God and lived
next door to the synagogue.
8 Crispus, the leader of the synagogue,
and all his household believed in the
Lord. Many others in Corinth also
became believers and were bap zed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
115
9 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in
a vision and told him, "Don’t be afraid!
Speak out! Don’t be silent!
10 For I am with you, and no one will
harm you because many people here in
this city belong to me."
11 So Paul stayed there for the next year
and a half, teaching the word of God.
12 But when Gallio became governor
of Achaia, some Jews rose in concerted
ac on against Paul and brought him
before the governor for judgment.
13 They accused Paul of "persuading
people to worship God in ways that are
contrary to the law."
14 But just as Paul started to make his
defense, Gallio turned to Paul’s accusers
and said, "Listen, you Jews, if this were
a case involving some wrongdoing or
a serious crime, I would be obliged to
listen to you.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
15 But since it is merely a ques
116
on of
words and names and your Jewish laws,
you take care of it. I refuse to judge such
ma ers."
16 And he drove them out of the
courtroom.
17 The mob had grabbed Sosthenes, the
leader of the synagogue, and had beaten
him right there in the courtroom. But
Gallio paid no a en on.
18 Paul stayed in Corinth for some me
a er that and then said good–bye to the
brothers and sisters and sailed for the
coast of Syria, taking Priscilla and Aquila
with him. (Earlier, at Cenchrea, Paul had
shaved his head according to Jewish
custom, for he had taken a vow.)
19 When they arrived at the port of
Ephesus, Paul le the others behind.
But while he was there, he went to the
synagogue to debate with the Jews.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
117
20 They asked him to stay longer, but he
declined.
21 So he le , saying, "I will come back
later, God willing." Then he set sail from
Ephesus.
22 The next stop was at the port of
Caesarea. From there he went up and
visited the church at Jerusalem and then
went back to An och.
23 A er spending some me in An och,
Paul went back to Gala a and Phrygia,
visi ng all the believers, encouraging
them and helping them to grow in the
Lord.
24 Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos,
an eloquent speaker who knew the
Scriptures well, had just arrived in
Ephesus from Alexandria in Egypt.
25 He had been taught the way of the
Lord and talked to others with great
enthusiasm and accuracy about Jesus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18 – 19 118
However, he knew only about John’s
bap sm.
26 When Priscilla and Aquila heard him
preaching boldly in the synagogue, they
took him aside and explained the way of
God more accurately.
27 Apollos had been thinking about
going to Achaia, and the brothers and
sisters in Ephesus encouraged him in
this. They wrote to the believers in
Achaia, asking them to welcome him.
When he arrived there, he proved to be
of great beneﬁt to those who, by God’s
grace, had believed.
28 He refuted all the Jews with powerful
arguments in public debate. Using the
Scriptures, he explained to them, "The
Messiah you are looking for is Jesus."
1 While Apollos was in Corinth,
Paul traveled through the interior
provinces. Finally, he came to Ephesus,
where he found several believers.
19ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
119
2 "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when
you believed?" he asked them. "No,"
they replied, "we don’t know what you
mean. We haven’t even heard that there
is a Holy Spirit."
3 "Then what bap sm did you
experience?" he asked. And they replied,
"The bap sm of John."
4 Paul said, "John’s bap sm was to
demonstrate a desire to turn from sin
and turn to God. John himself told the
people to believe in Jesus, the one John
said would come later."
5 As soon as they heard this, they were
bap zed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6 Then when Paul laid his hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came on them,
and they spoke in other tongues and
prophesied.
7 There were about twelve men in all.
8 Then Paul went to the synagogue
and preached boldly for the next threeACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
120
months, arguing persuasively about the
Kingdom of God.
9 But some rejected his message and
publicly spoke against the Way, so Paul
le the synagogue and took the believers
with him. Then he began preaching daily
at the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
10 This went on for the next two years,
so that people throughout the province
of Asia––both Jews and Greeks––heard
the Lord’s message.
11 God gave Paul the power to do
unusual miracles,
12 so that even when handkerchiefs or
cloths that had touched his skin were
placed on sick people, they were healed
of their diseases, and any evil spirits
within them came out.
13 A team of Jews who were traveling
from town to town cas ng out evil spirits
tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus.
The incanta on they used was this: "IACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
121
command you by Jesus, whom Paul
preaches, to come out!"
14 Seven sons of Sceva, a leading priest,
were doing this.
15 But when they tried it on a man
possessed by an evil spirit, the spirit
replied, "I know Jesus, and I know Paul.
But who are you?"
16 And he leaped on them and a acked
them with such violence that they ﬂed
from the house, naked and badly injured.
17 The story of what happened spread
quickly all through Ephesus, to Jews and
Greeks alike. A solemn fear descended
on the city, and the name of the Lord
Jesus was greatly honored.
18 Many who became believers
confessed their sinful prac ces.
19 A number of them who had
been prac cing magic brought their
incanta on books and burned them at aACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
122
public bonﬁre. The value of the books
was several million dollars.
20 So the message about the Lord
spread widely and had a powerful eﬀect.
21 A erward Paul felt impelled by the
Holy Spirit to go over to Macedonia and
Achaia before returning to Jerusalem.
"And a er that," he said, "I must go on
to Rome!"
22 He sent his two assistants, Timothy
and Erastus, on ahead to Macedonia
while he stayed awhile longer in the
province of Asia.
23 But about that me, serious trouble
developed in Ephesus concerning the
Way.
24 It began with Demetrius, a silversmith
who had a large business manufacturing
silver shrines of the Greek goddess
Artemis. He kept many cra smen busy.
25 He called the cra smen together,
along with others employed in relatedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
123
trades, and addressed them as follows:
"Gentlemen, you know that our wealth
comes from this business.
26 As you have seen and heard, this
man Paul has persuaded many people
that handmade gods aren’t gods at all.
And this is happening not only here
in Ephesus but throughout the en re
province!
27 Of course, I’m not just talking
about the loss of public respect for our
business. I’m also concerned that the
temple of the great goddess Artemis
will lose its inﬂuence and that Artemis–
–this magniﬁcent goddess worshiped
throughout the province of Asia and all
around the world––will be robbed of her
pres ge!"
28 At this their anger boiled, and they
began shou ng, "Great is Artemis of the
Ephesians!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
124
29 A crowd began to gather, and soon
the city was ﬁlled with confusion.
Everyone rushed to the amphitheater,
dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus,
who were Paul’s traveling companions
from Macedonia.
30 Paul wanted to go in, but the
believers wouldn’t let him.
31 Some of the oﬃcials of the province,
friends of Paul, also sent a message to
him, begging him not to risk his life by
entering the amphitheater.
32 Inside, the people were all shou ng,
some one thing and some another.
Everything was in confusion. In fact,
most of them didn’t even know why they
were there.
33 Alexander was thrust forward by
some of the Jews, who encouraged him
to explain the situa on. He mo oned for
silence and tried to speak in defense.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
125
34 But when the crowd realized he
was a Jew, they started shou ng again
and kept it up for two hours: "Great
is Artemis of the Ephesians! Great is
Artemis of the Ephesians!"
35 At last the mayor was able to quiet
them down enough to speak. "Ci zens
of Ephesus," he said. "Everyone knows
that Ephesus is the oﬃcial guardian of
the temple of the great Artemis, whose
image fell down to us from heaven.
36 Since this is an indisputable fact, you
shouldn’t be disturbed, no ma er what
is said. Don’t do anything rash.
37 You have brought these men here,
but they have stolen nothing from the
temple and have not spoken against our
goddess.
38 If Demetrius and the cra smen have
a case against them, the courts are in
session and the judges can take theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19 – 20 126
case at once. Let them go through legal
channels.
39 And if there are complaints about
other ma ers, they can be se led in a
legal assembly.
40 I am afraid we are in danger of being
charged with rio ng by the Roman
government, since there is no cause
for all this commo on. And if Rome
demands an explana on, we won’t know
what to say."
41 Then he dismissed them, and they
dispersed.
1 When it was all over, Paul sent
for the believers and encouraged
them. Then he said good–bye and le
for Macedonia.
2 Along the way, he encouraged the
believers in all the towns he passed
through. Then he traveled down to
Greece,
20ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
127
3 where he stayed for three months.
He was preparing to sail back to Syria
when he discovered a plot by some Jews
against his life, so he decided to return
through Macedonia.
4 Several men were traveling with him.
They were Sopater of Berea, the son
of Pyrrhus; Aristarchus and Secundus,
from Thessalonica; Gaius, from Derbe;
Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus,
who were from the province of Asia.
5 They went ahead and waited for us at
Troas.
6 As soon as the Passover season
ended, we boarded a ship at Philippi in
Macedonia and ﬁve days later arrived in
Troas, where we stayed a week.
7 On the ﬁrst day of the week, we
gathered to observe the Lord’s Supper.
Paul was preaching; and since he was
leaving the next day, he talked un l
midnight.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
128
8 The upstairs room where we met was
lighted with many ﬂickering lamps.
9 As Paul spoke on and on, a young
man named Eutychus, si ng on the
windowsill, became very drowsy. Finally,
he sank into a deep sleep and fell three
stories to his death below.
10 Paul went down, bent over him, and
took him into his arms. "Don’t worry,"
he said, "he’s alive!"
11 Then they all went back upstairs and
ate the Lord’s Supper together. And Paul
con nued talking to them un l dawn;
then he le .
12 Meanwhile, the young man was
taken home unhurt, and everyone was
greatly relieved.
13 Paul went by land to Assos, where he
had arranged for us to join him, and we
went on ahead by ship.
14 He joined us there and we sailed
together to Mitylene.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
129
15 The next day we passed the island of
Kios. The following day, we crossed to
the island of Samos. And a day later we
arrived at Miletus.
16 Paul had decided against stopping
at Ephesus this me because he didn’t
want to spend further me in the
province of Asia. He was hurrying to get
to Jerusalem, if possible, for the Fes val
of Pentecost.
17 But when we landed at Miletus, he
sent a message to the elders of the
church at Ephesus, asking them to come
down to meet him.
18 When they arrived he declared, "You
know that from the day I set foot in the
province of Asia un l now
19 I have done the Lord’s work humbly–
–yes, and with tears. I have endured the
trials that came to me from the plots of
the Jews.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
130
20 Yet I never shrank from telling you
the truth, either publicly or in your
homes.
21 I have had one message for Jews and
Gen les alike––the necessity of turning
from sin and turning to God, and of faith
in our Lord Jesus.
22 "And now I am going to Jerusalem,
drawn there irresis bly by the Holy
Spirit, not knowing what awaits me,
23 except that the Holy Spirit has told
me in city a er city that jail and suﬀering
lie ahead.
24 But my life is worth nothing unless
I use it for doing the work assigned me
by the Lord Jesus––the work of telling
others the Good News about God’s
wonderful kindness and love.
25 "And now I know that none of you to
whom I have preached the Kingdom will
ever see me again.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
131
26 Let me say plainly that I have been
faithful. No one’s damna on can be
blamed on me,
27 for I didn’t shrink from declaring all
that God wants for you.
28 "And now beware! Be sure that you
feed and shepherd God’s ﬂock––his
church, purchased with his blood––over
whom the Holy Spirit has appointed you
as elders.
29 I know full well that false teachers,
like vicious wolves, will come in among
you a er I leave, not sparing the ﬂock.
30 Even some of you will distort the
truth in order to draw a following.
31 Watch out! Remember the three
years I was with you––my constant
watch and care over you night and day,
and my many tears for you.
32 "And now I entrust you to God and
the word of his grace––his message that
is able to build you up and give you anACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
132
inheritance with all those he has set
apart for himself.
33 "I have never coveted anyone’s
money or ﬁne clothing.
34 You know that these hands of mine
have worked to pay my own way, and I
have even supplied the needs of those
who were with me.
35 And I have been a constant example
of how you can help the poor by working
hard. You should remember the words
of the Lord Jesus: ‘It is more blessed to
give than to receive.’"
36 When he had ﬁnished speaking, he
knelt and prayed with them.
37 They wept aloud as they embraced
him in farewell,
38 sad most of all because he had said
that they would never see him again.
Then they accompanied him down to
the ship.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
1A
133
er saying farewell to the
Ephesian elders, we sailed
straight to the island of Cos. The next
day we reached Rhodes and then went
to Patara.
2 There we boarded a ship sailing for
the Syrian province of Phoenicia.
3 We sighted the island of Cyprus,
passed it on our le , and landed at the
harbor of Tyre, in Syria, where the ship
was to unload.
4 We went ashore, found the local
believers, and stayed with them a week.
These disciples prophesied through the
Holy Spirit that Paul should not go on to
Jerusalem.
5 When we returned to the ship
at the end of the week, the en re
congrega on, including wives and
children, came down to the shore with
us. There we knelt, prayed,
21ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
134
6 and said our farewells. Then we went
aboard, and they returned home.
7 The next stop a er leaving Tyre
was Ptolemais, where we greeted the
brothers and sisters but stayed only one
day.
8 Then we went on to Caesarea and
stayed at the home of Philip the
Evangelist, one of the seven men who
had been chosen to distribute food.
9 He had four unmarried daughters who
had the gi of prophecy.
10 During our stay of several days, a
man named Agabus, who also had the
gi of prophecy, arrived from Judea.
11 When he visited us, he took Paul’s
belt and bound his own feet and hands
with it. Then he said, "The Holy Spirit
declares, ‘So shall the owner of this
belt be bound by the Jewish leaders
in Jerusalem and turned over to the
Romans.’"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
135
12 When we heard this, we who were
traveling with him, as well as the local
believers, begged Paul not to go on to
Jerusalem.
13 But he said, "Why all this weeping?
You are breaking my heart! For I am
ready not only to be jailed at Jerusalem
but also to die for the sake of the Lord
Jesus."
14 When it was clear that we couldn’t
persuade him, we gave up and said, "The
will of the Lord be done."
15 Shortly a erward we packed our
things and le for Jerusalem.
16 Some believers from Caesarea
accompanied us, and they took us to the
home of Mnason, a man originally from
Cyprus and one of the early disciples.
17 All the brothers and sisters in
Jerusalem welcomed us cordially.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
136
18 The next day Paul went in with us to
meet with James, and all the elders of
the Jerusalem church were present.
19 A er gree ngs were exchanged,
Paul gave a detailed account of the
things God had accomplished among the
Gen les through his ministry.
20 A er hearing this, they praised God.
But then they said, "You know, dear
brother, how many thousands of Jews
have also believed, and they all take the
law of Moses very seriously.
21 Our Jewish Chris ans here at
Jerusalem have been told that you are
teaching all the Jews living in the Gen le
world to turn their backs on the laws of
Moses. They say that you teach people
not to circumcise their children or follow
other Jewish customs.
22 Now what can be done? For they will
certainly hear that you have come.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
23 "Here’s our sugges
137
on. We have four
men here who have taken a vow and are
preparing to shave their heads.
24 Go with them to the Temple and
join them in the puriﬁca on ceremony,
and pay for them to have their heads
shaved. Then everyone will know that
the rumors are all false and that you
yourself observe the Jewish laws.
25 "As for the Gen le Chris ans, all we
ask of them is what we already told them
in a le er: They should not eat food
oﬀered to idols, nor consume blood, nor
eat meat from strangled animals, and
they should stay away from all sexual
immorality."
26 So Paul agreed to their request,
and the next day he went through the
puriﬁca on ritual with the men and
went to the Temple. Then he publicly
announced the date when their vowsACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
138
would end and sacriﬁces would be
oﬀered for each of them.
27 The seven days were almost ended
when some Jews from the province of
Asia saw Paul in the Temple and roused
a mob against him. They grabbed him,
28 yelling, "Men of Israel! Help! This
is the man who teaches against our
people and tells everybody to disobey
the Jewish laws. He speaks against
the Temple––and he even deﬁles it by
bringing Gen les in!"
29 (For earlier that day they had seen
him in the city with Trophimus, a Gen le
from Ephesus, and they assumed Paul
had taken him into the Temple.)
30 The whole popula on of the city was
rocked by these accusa ons, and a great
riot followed. Paul was dragged out of
the Temple, and immediately the gates
were closed behind him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
139
31 As they were trying to kill him, word
reached the commander of the Roman
regiment that all Jerusalem was in an
uproar.
32 He immediately called out his
soldiers and oﬃcers and ran down
among the crowd. When the mob saw
the commander and the troops coming,
they stopped bea ng Paul.
33 The commander arrested him and
ordered him bound with two chains.
Then he asked the crowd who he was
and what he had done.
34 Some shouted one thing and some
another. He couldn’t ﬁnd out the truth
in all the uproar and confusion, so he
ordered Paul to be taken to the fortress.
35 As they reached the stairs, the mob
grew so violent the soldiers had to li
Paul to their shoulders to protect him.
36 And the crowd followed behind
shou ng, "Kill him, kill him!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21 – 22 140
37 As Paul was about to be taken inside,
he said to the commander, "May I have a
word with you?" "Do you know Greek?"
the commander asked, surprised.
38 "Aren’t you the Egyp an who led a
rebellion some me ago and took four
thousand members of the Assassins out
into the desert?"
39 "No," Paul replied, "I am a Jew from
Tarsus in Cilicia, which is an important
city. Please, let me talk to these people."
40 The commander agreed, so Paul
stood on the stairs and mo oned to the
people to be quiet. Soon a deep silence
enveloped the crowd, and he addressed
them in their own language, Aramaic.
1 "Brothers and esteemed
fathers," Paul said, "listen to me
as I oﬀer my defense."
2 When they heard him speaking in
their own language, the silence was even
greater.
22ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
141
3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city
in Cilicia, and I was brought up and
educated here in Jerusalem under
Gamaliel. At his feet I learned to follow
our Jewish laws and customs very
carefully. I became very zealous to honor
God in everything I did, just as all of you
are today.
4 And I persecuted the followers of the
Way, hounding some to death, binding
and delivering both men and women to
prison.
5 The high priest and the whole council
of leaders can tes fy that this is so. For I
received le ers from them to our Jewish
brothers in Damascus, authorizing me
to bring the Chris ans from there to
Jerusalem, in chains, to be punished.
6 "As I was on the road, nearing
Damascus, about noon a very bright light
from heaven suddenly shone around
me.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
142
7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice
saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you
persecu ng me?’
8 "‘Who are you, sir?’ I asked. And he
replied, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, the one
you are persecu ng.’
9 The people with me saw the light but
didn’t hear the voice.
10 "I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And
the Lord told me, ‘Get up and go into
Damascus, and there you will be told all
that you are to do.’
11 "I was blinded by the intense light
and had to be led into Damascus by my
companions.
12 A man named Ananias lived there.
He was a godly man in his devo on to
the law, and he was well thought of by
all the Jews of Damascus.
13 He came to me and stood beside
me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive yourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
143
sight.’ And that very hour I could see
him!
14 "Then he told me, ‘The God of our
ancestors has chosen you to know his
will and to see the Righteous One and
hear him speak.
15 You are to take his message
everywhere, telling the whole world
what you have seen and heard.
16 And now, why delay? Get up and be
bap zed, and have your sins washed
away, calling on the name of the Lord.’
17 "One day a er I returned to
Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple,
and I fell into a trance.
18 I saw a vision of Jesus saying to me,
‘Hurry! Leave Jerusalem, for the people
here won’t believe you when you give
them your tes mony about me.’
19 "‘But Lord,’ I argued, ‘they certainly
know that I imprisoned and beat thoseACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
144
in every synagogue who believed on
you.
20 And when your witness Stephen was
killed, I was standing there agreeing. I
kept the coats they laid aside as they
stoned him.’
21 "But the Lord said to me, ‘Leave
Jerusalem, for I will send you far away to
the Gen les!’"
22 The crowd listened un l Paul came
to that word; then with one voice they
shouted, "Away with such a fellow! Kill
him! He isn’t ﬁt to live!"
23 They yelled, threw oﬀ their coats,
and tossed handfuls of dust into the air.
24 The commander brought Paul inside
and ordered him lashed with whips to
make him confess his crime. He wanted
to ﬁnd out why the crowd had become
so furious.
25 As they ed Paul down to lash him,
Paul said to the oﬃcer standing there, "IsACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
145
it legal for you to whip a Roman ci zen
who hasn’t even been tried?"
26 The oﬃcer went to the commander
and asked, "What are you doing? This
man is a Roman ci zen!"
27 So the commander went over and
asked Paul, "Tell me, are you a Roman
ci zen?" "Yes, I certainly am," Paul
replied.
28 "I am, too," the commander
mu ered, "and it cost me plenty!" "But I
am a ci zen by birth!"
29 The soldiers who were about to
interrogate Paul quickly withdrew when
they heard he was a Roman ci zen, and
the commander was frightened because
he had ordered him bound and whipped.
30 The next day the commander freed
Paul from his chains and ordered the
leading priests into session with the
Jewish high council. He had Paul broughtACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
146
in before them to try to ﬁnd out what
the trouble was all about.
1 Gazing intently at the high
council, Paul began: "Brothers, I
have always lived before God in all good
conscience!"
2 Instantly Ananias the high priest
commanded those close to Paul to slap
him on the mouth.
3 But Paul said to him, "God will slap
you, you whitewashed wall! What kind of
judge are you to break the law yourself
by ordering me struck like that?"
4 Those standing near Paul said to him,
"Is that the way to talk to God’s high
priest?"
5 "I’m sorry, brothers. I didn’t realize he
was the high priest," Paul replied, "for
the Scriptures say, ‘Do not speak evil of
anyone who rules over you.’"
6 Paul realized that some members of
the high council were Sadducees and
23ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
147
some were Pharisees, so he shouted,
"Brothers, I am a Pharisee, as were all
my ancestors! And I am on trial because
my hope is in the resurrec on of the
dead!"
7 This divided the council––the
Pharisees against the Sadducees––
8 for the Sadducees say there is no
resurrec on or angels or spirits, but the
Pharisees believe in all of these.
9 So a great clamor arose. Some of
the teachers of religious law who were
Pharisees jumped up to argue that Paul
was all right. "We see nothing wrong
with him," they shouted. "Perhaps a
spirit or an angel spoke to him."
10 The shou ng grew louder and louder,
and the men were tugging at Paul from
both sides, pulling him this way and
that. Finally, the commander, fearing
they would tear him apart, ordered hisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
148
soldiers to take him away from them and
bring him back to the fortress.
11 That night the Lord appeared to Paul
and said, "Be encouraged, Paul. Just as
you have told the people about me here
in Jerusalem, you must preach the Good
News in Rome."
12 The next morning a group of Jews got
together and bound themselves with an
oath to neither eat nor drink un l they
had killed Paul.
13 There were more than forty of them.
14 They went to the leading priests and
other leaders and told them what they
had done. "We have bound ourselves
under oath to neither eat nor drink un l
we have killed Paul.
15 You and the high council should tell
the commander to bring Paul back to the
council again," they requested. "Pretend
you want to examine his case more fully.
We will kill him on the way."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
149
16 But Paul’s nephew heard of their plan
and went to the fortress and told Paul.
17 Paul called one of the oﬃcers
and said, "Take this young man to
the commander. He has something
important to tell him."
18 So the oﬃcer did, explaining, "Paul,
the prisoner, called me over and asked
me to bring this young man to you
because he has something to tell you."
19 The commander took him by the
arm, led him aside, and asked, "What is
it you want to tell me?"
20 Paul’s nephew told him, "Some Jews
are going to ask you to bring Paul before
the Jewish high council tomorrow,
pretending they want to get some more
informa on.
21 But don’t do it! There are more than
forty men hiding along the way ready to
jump him and kill him. They have vowed
not to eat or drink un l they kill him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
150
They are ready, expec ng you to agree
to their request."
22 "Don’t let a soul know you told me
this," the commander warned the young
man as he sent him away.
23 Then the commander called two
of his oﬃcers and ordered, "Get two
hundred soldiers ready to leave for
Caesarea at nine o’clock tonight. Also
take two hundred spearmen and seventy
horsemen.
24 Provide horses for Paul to ride, and
get him safely to Governor Felix."
25 Then he wrote this le er to the
governor:
26 "From Claudius Lysias, to his
Excellency, Governor Felix. Gree ngs!
27 This man was seized by some Jews,
and they were about to kill him when I
arrived with the troops. When I learned
that he was a Roman ci zen, I removed
him to safety.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
151
28 Then I took him to their high council
to try to ﬁnd out what he had done.
29 I soon discovered it was something
regarding their religious law––certainly
nothing worthy of imprisonment or
death.
30 But when I was informed of a plot
to kill him, I immediately sent him on
to you. I have told his accusers to bring
their charges before you."
31 So that night, as ordered, the soldiers
took Paul as far as An patris.
32 They returned to the fortress the
next morning, while the horsemen took
him on to Caesarea.
33 When they arrived in Caesarea,
they presented Paul and the le er to
Governor Felix.
34 He read it and then asked Paul what
province he was from. "Cilicia," Paul
answered.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23 – 24 152
35 "I will hear your case myself when
your accusers arrive," the governor
told him. Then the governor ordered
him kept in the prison at Herod’s
headquarters.
1 Five days later Ananias, the high
priest, arrived with some of the
Jewish leaders and the lawyer Tertullus,
to press charges against Paul.
2 When Paul was called in, Tertullus
laid charges against Paul in the
following address to the governor: "Your
Excellency, you have given peace to us
Jews and have enacted reforms for us.
3 And for all of this we are very grateful
to you.
4 But lest I bore you, kindly give me
your a en on for only a moment as I
brieﬂy outline our case against this man.
5 For we have found him to be a
troublemaker, a man who is constantly
inci ng the Jews throughout the world
24ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
153
to riots and rebellions against the Roman
government. He is a ringleader of the
sect known as the Nazarenes.
6 Moreover he was trying to deﬁle the
Temple when we arrested him.
7 [[EMPTY]]
8 You can ﬁnd out the truth of our
accusa ons by examining him yourself."
9 Then the other Jews chimed in,
declaring that everything Tertullus said
was true.
10 Now it was Paul’s turn. The governor
mo oned for him to rise and speak. Paul
said, "I know, sir, that you have been a
judge of Jewish aﬀairs for many years,
and this gives me conﬁdence as I make
my defense.
11 You can quickly discover that it was
no more than twelve days ago that I
arrived in Jerusalem to worship at the
Temple.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
154
12 I didn’t argue with anyone in the
Temple, nor did I incite a riot in any
synagogue or on the streets of the city.
13 These men certainly cannot prove
the things they accuse me of doing.
14 "But I admit that I follow the Way,
which they call a sect. I worship the God
of our ancestors, and I ﬁrmly believe the
Jewish law and everything wri en in the
books of prophecy.
15 I have hope in God, just as these men
do, that he will raise both the righteous
and the ungodly.
16 Because of this, I always try to
maintain a clear conscience before God
and everyone else.
17 "A er several years away, I returned
to Jerusalem with money to aid my
people and to oﬀer sacriﬁces to God.
18 My accusers saw me in the Temple
as I was comple ng a puriﬁca on ritual.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
155
There was no crowd around me and no
rio ng.
19 But some Jews from the province
of Asia were there––and they ought to
be here to bring charges if they have
anything against me!
20 Ask these men here what wrongdoing
the Jewish high council found in me,
21 except for one thing I said when
I shouted out, ‘I am on trial before
you today because I believe in the
resurrec on of the dead!’"
22 Felix, who was quite familiar with
the Way, adjourned the hearing and
said, "Wait un l Lysias, the garrison
commander, arrives. Then I will decide
the case."
23 He ordered an oﬃcer to keep Paul in
custody but to give him some freedom
and allow his friends to visit him and
take care of his needs.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24 – 25 156
24 A few days later Felix came with his
wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish. Sending
for Paul, they listened as he told them
about faith in Christ Jesus.
25 As he reasoned with them about
righteousness and self–control and the
judgment to come, Felix was terriﬁed.
"Go away for now," he replied. "When
it is more convenient, I’ll call for you
again."
26 He also hoped that Paul would bribe
him, so he sent for him quite o en and
talked with him.
27 Two years went by in this way; then
Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus.
And because Felix wanted to gain favor
with the Jewish leaders, he le Paul in
prison.
1 Three days a er Festus arrived
in Caesarea to take over his new
responsibili es, he le for Jerusalem,
25ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
157
2 where the leading priests and other
Jewish leaders met with him and made
their accusa ons against Paul.
3 They asked Festus as a favor to
transfer Paul to Jerusalem. (Their plan
was to waylay and kill him.)
4 But Festus replied that Paul was
at Caesarea and he himself would be
returning there soon.
5 So he said, "Those of you in authority
can return with me. If Paul has done
anything wrong, you can make your
accusa ons."
6 Eight or ten days later he returned
to Caesarea, and on the following day
Paul’s trial began.
7 On Paul’s arrival in court, the Jewish
leaders from Jerusalem gathered around
and made many serious accusa ons
they couldn’t prove.
8 Paul denied the charges. "I am not
guilty," he said. "I have commi ed noACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
158
crime against the Jewish laws or the
Temple or the Roman government."
9 Then Festus, wan ng to please the
Jews, asked him, "Are you willing to go
to Jerusalem and stand trial before me
there?"
10 But Paul replied, "No! This is the
oﬃcial Roman court, so I ought to be
tried right here. You know very well I am
not guilty.
11 If I have done something worthy of
death, I don’t refuse to die. But if I am
innocent, neither you nor anyone else
has a right to turn me over to these men
to kill me. I appeal to Caesar!"
12 Festus conferred with his advisers
and then replied, "Very well! You have
appealed to Caesar, and to Caesar you
shall go!"
13 A few days later King Agrippa arrived
with his sister, Bernice, to pay their
respects to Festus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
159
14 During their stay of several days,
Festus discussed Paul’s case with the
king. "There is a prisoner here," he told
him, "whose case was le for me by
Felix.
15 When I was in Jerusalem, the leading
priests and other Jewish leaders pressed
charges against him and asked me to
sentence him.
16 Of course, I quickly pointed out to
them that Roman law does not convict
people without a trial. They are given an
opportunity to defend themselves face
to face with their accusers.
17 "When they came here for the trial,
I called the case the very next day and
ordered Paul brought in.
18 But the accusa ons made against
him weren’t at all what I expected.
19 It was something about their religion
and about someone called Jesus who
died, but whom Paul insists is alive.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
160
20 I was perplexed as to how to conduct
an inves ga on of this kind, and I asked
him whether he would be willing to
stand trial on these charges in Jerusalem.
21 But Paul appealed to the emperor. So
I ordered him back to jail un l I could
arrange to send him to Caesar."
22 "I’d like to hear the man myself,"
Agrippa said. And Festus replied, "You
shall––tomorrow!"
23 So the next day Agrippa and Bernice
arrived at the auditorium with great
pomp, accompanied by military oﬃcers
and prominent men of the city. Festus
ordered that Paul be brought in.
24 Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and
all present, this is the man whose death
is demanded both by the local Jews and
by those in Jerusalem.
25 But in my opinion he has done
nothing worthy of death. However, heACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25 – 26 161
appealed his case to the emperor, and I
decided to send him.
26 But what shall I write the emperor?
For there is no real charge against him.
So I have brought him before all of you,
and especially you, King Agrippa, so
that a er we examine him, I might have
something to write.
27 For it doesn’t seem reasonable to
send a prisoner to the emperor without
specifying the charges against him!"
1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You
may speak in your defense." So
Paul, with a gesture of his hand, started
his defense:
2 "I am fortunate, King Agrippa, that
you are the one hearing my defense
against all these accusa ons made by
the Jewish leaders,
3 for I know you are an expert on Jewish
customs and controversies. Now please
listen to me pa ently!
26ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
162
4 "As the Jewish leaders are well aware,
I was given a thorough Jewish training
from my earliest childhood among my
own people and in Jerusalem.
5 If they would admit it, they know that
I have been a member of the Pharisees,
the strictest sect of our religion.
6 Now I am on trial because I am looking
forward to the fulﬁllment of God’s
promise made to our ancestors.
7 In fact, that is why the twelve tribes
of Israel worship God night and day, and
they share the same hope I have. Yet, O
king, they say it is wrong for me to have
this hope!
8 Why does it seem incredible to any of
you that God can raise the dead?
9 "I used to believe that I ought to
do everything I could to oppose the
followers of Jesus of Nazareth.
10 Authorized by the leading priests,
I caused many of the believers inACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
163
Jerusalem to be sent to prison. And I cast
my vote against them when they were
condemned to death.
11 Many mes I had them whipped in
the synagogues to try to get them to
curse Christ. I was so violently opposed
to them that I even hounded them in
distant ci es of foreign lands.
12 "One day I was on such a mission to
Damascus, armed with the authority and
commission of the leading priests.
13 About noon, Your Majesty, a light
from heaven brighter than the sun shone
down on me and my companions.
14 We all fell down, and I heard a voice
saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why
are you persecu ng me? It is hard for
you to ﬁght against my will.’
15 "‘Who are you, sir?’ I asked. "And the
Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus, the one you are
persecu ng.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
164
16 Now stand up! For I have appeared
to you to appoint you as my servant and
my witness. You are to tell the world
about this experience and about other
mes I will appear to you.
17 And I will protect you from both your
own people and the Gen les. Yes, I am
going to send you to the Gen les,
18 to open their eyes so they may turn
from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan to God. Then they will
receive forgiveness for their sins and be
given a place among God’s people, who
are set apart by faith in me.’
19 "And so, O King Agrippa, I was not
disobedient to that vision from heaven.
20 I preached ﬁrst to those in Damascus,
then in Jerusalem and throughout all
Judea, and also to the Gen les, that all
must turn from their sins and turn to
God––and prove they have changed by
the good things they do.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
165
21 Some Jews arrested me in the Temple
for preaching this, and they tried to kill
me.
22 But God protected me so that I am
s ll alive today to tell these facts to
everyone, from the least to the greatest.
I teach nothing except what the prophets
and Moses said would happen––
23 that the Messiah would suﬀer and be
the ﬁrst to rise from the dead as a light
to Jews and Gen les alike."
24 Suddenly, Festus shouted, "Paul, you
are insane. Too much study has made
you crazy!"
25 But Paul replied, "I am not insane,
Most Excellent Festus. I am speaking the
sober truth.
26 And King Agrippa knows about these
things. I speak frankly, for I am sure
these events are all familiar to him, for
they were not done in a corner!ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26 – 27 166
27 King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know you do––"
28 Agrippa interrupted him. "Do you
think you can make me a Chris an so
quickly?"
29 Paul replied, "Whether quickly or
not, I pray to God that both you and
everyone here in this audience might
become the same as I am, except for
these chains."
30 Then the king, the governor, Bernice,
and all the others stood and le .
31 As they talked it over they agreed,
"This man hasn’t done anything worthy
of death or imprisonment."
32 And Agrippa said to Festus, "He could
be set free if he hadn’t appealed to
Caesar!"
1 When the me came, we set sail
for Italy. Paul and several other
prisoners were placed in the custody of
27ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
167
an army oﬃcer named Julius, a captain
of the Imperial Regiment.
2 And Aristarchus, a Macedonian from
Thessalonica, was also with us. We
le on a boat whose home port was
Adramy um; it was scheduled to make
several stops at ports along the coast of
the province of Asia.
3 The next day when we docked at
Sidon, Julius was very kind to Paul and
let him go ashore to visit with friends so
they could provide for his needs.
4 Pu ng out to sea from there, we
encountered headwinds that made it
diﬃcult to keep the ship on course, so
we sailed north of Cyprus between the
island and the mainland.
5 We passed along the coast of the
provinces of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
landing at Myra, in the province of Lycia.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
6 There the oﬃcer found an Egyp
168
an
ship from Alexandria that was bound for
Italy, and he put us on board.
7 We had several days of rough sailing,
and a er great diﬃculty we ﬁnally
neared Cnidus. But the wind was against
us, so we sailed down to the leeward
side of Crete, past the cape of Salmone.
8 We struggled along the coast with
great diﬃculty and ﬁnally arrived at Fair
Havens, near the city of Lasea.
9 We had lost a lot of me. The weather
was becoming dangerous for long
voyages by then because it was so late
in the fall, and Paul spoke to the ship’s
oﬃcers about it.
10 "Sirs," he said, "I believe there is
trouble ahead if we go on––shipwreck,
loss of cargo, injuries, and danger to our
lives."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
169
11 But the oﬃcer in charge of the
prisoners listened more to the ship’s
captain and the owner than to Paul.
12 And since Fair Havens was an
exposed harbor––a poor place to spend
the winter––most of the crew wanted
to go to Phoenix, farther up the coast
of Crete, and spend the winter there.
Phoenix was a good harbor with only a
southwest and northwest exposure.
13 When a light wind began blowing
from the south, the sailors thought they
could make it. So they pulled up anchor
and sailed along close to shore.
14 But the weather changed abruptly,
and a wind of typhoon strength (a
"northeaster," they called it) caught the
ship and blew it out to sea.
15 They couldn’t turn the ship into the
wind, so they gave up and let it run
before the gale.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
170
16 We sailed behind a small island
named Cauda, where with great
diﬃculty we hoisted aboard the lifeboat
that was being towed behind us.
17 Then we banded the ship with ropes
to strengthen the hull. The sailors were
afraid of being driven across to the
sandbars of Syr s oﬀ the African coast,
so they lowered the sea anchor and
were thus driven before the wind.
18 The next day, as gale–force winds
con nued to ba er the ship, the crew
began throwing the cargo overboard.
19 The following day they even threw
out the ship’s equipment and anything
else they could lay their hands on.
20 The terrible storm raged unabated
for many days, blo ng out the sun and
the stars, un l at last all hope was gone.
21 No one had eaten for a long me.
Finally, Paul called the crew together and
said, "Men, you should have listened toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
171
me in the ﬁrst place and not le Fair
Havens. You would have avoided all this
injury and loss.
22 But take courage! None of you will
lose your lives, even though the ship will
go down.
23 For last night an angel of the God to
whom I belong and whom I serve stood
beside me,
24 and he said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul, for
you will surely stand trial before Caesar!
What’s more, God in his goodness has
granted safety to everyone sailing with
you.’
25 So take courage! For I believe God. It
will be just as he said.
26 But we will be shipwrecked on an
island."
27 About midnight on the fourteenth
night of the storm, as we were being
driven across the Sea of Adria, the sailors
sensed land was near.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
172
28 They took soundings and found the
water was only 120 feet deep. A li le
later they sounded again and found only
90 feet.
29 At this rate they were afraid we
would soon be driven against the rocks
along the shore, so they threw out four
anchors from the stern and prayed for
daylight.
30 Then the sailors tried to abandon the
ship; they lowered the lifeboat as though
they were going to put out anchors from
the prow.
31 But Paul said to the commanding
oﬃcer and the soldiers, "You will all die
unless the sailors stay aboard."
32 So the soldiers cut the ropes and let
the boat fall oﬀ.
33 As the darkness gave way to the early
morning light, Paul begged everyone to
eat. "You haven’t touched food for two
weeks," he said.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
173
34 "Please eat something now for your
own good. For not a hair of your heads
will perish."
35 Then he took some bread, gave
thanks to God before them all, and broke
oﬀ a piece and ate it.
36 Then everyone was encouraged,
37 and all 276 of us began ea ng––for
that is the number we had aboard.
38 A er ea ng, the crew lightened the
ship further by throwing the cargo of
wheat overboard.
39 When morning dawned, they didn’t
recognize the coastline, but they saw a
bay with a beach and wondered if they
could get between the rocks and get the
ship safely to shore.
40 So they cut oﬀ the anchors and le
them in the sea. Then they lowered the
rudders, raised the foresail, and headed
toward shore.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27 – 28 174
41 But the ship hit a shoal and ran
aground. The bow of the ship stuck fast,
while the stern was repeatedly smashed
by the force of the waves and began to
break apart.
42 The soldiers wanted to kill the
prisoners to make sure they didn’t swim
ashore and escape.
43 But the commanding oﬃcer wanted
to spare Paul, so he didn’t let them carry
out their plan. Then he ordered all who
could swim to jump overboard ﬁrst and
make for land,
44 and he told the others to try for it on
planks and debris from the broken ship.
So everyone escaped safely ashore!
1 Once we were safe on shore,
we learned that we were on the
island of Malta.
2 The people of the island were very
kind to us. It was cold and rainy, so they
28ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
175
built a ﬁre on the shore to welcome us
and warm us.
3 As Paul gathered an armful of s cks
and was laying them on the ﬁre, a
poisonous snake, driven out by the heat,
fastened itself onto his hand.
4 The people of the island saw it
hanging there and said to each other, "A
murderer, no doubt! Though he escaped
the sea, jus ce will not permit him to
live."
5 But Paul shook oﬀ the snake into the
ﬁre and was unharmed.
6 The people waited for him to swell up
or suddenly drop dead. But when they
had waited a long me and saw no harm
come to him, they changed their minds
and decided he was a god.
7 Near the shore where we landed was
an estate belonging to Publius, the chief
oﬃcial of the island. He welcomed us
courteously and fed us for three days.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
176
8 As it happened, Publius’s father was ill
with fever and dysentery. Paul went in
and prayed for him, and laying his hands
on him, he healed him.
9 Then all the other sick people on the
island came and were cured.
10 As a result we were showered with
honors, and when the me came to sail,
people put on board all sorts of things
we would need for the trip.
11 It was three months a er the
shipwreck that we set sail on another
ship that had wintered at the island––an
Alexandrian ship with the twin gods as
its ﬁgurehead.
12 Our ﬁrst stop was Syracuse, where
we stayed three days.
13 From there we sailed across to
Rhegium. A day later a south wind began
blowing, so the following day we sailed
up the coast to Puteoli.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
177
14 There we found some believers, who
invited us to stay with them seven days.
And so we came to Rome.
15 The brothers and sisters in Rome
had heard we were coming, and they
came to meet us at the Forum on the
Appian Way. Others joined us at The
Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he
thanked God and took courage.
16 When we arrived in Rome, Paul
was permi ed to have his own private
lodging, though he was guarded by a
soldier.
17 Three days a er Paul’s arrival, he
called together the local Jewish leaders.
He said to them, "Brothers, I was
arrested in Jerusalem and handed over
to the Roman government, even though
I had done nothing against our people or
the customs of our ancestors.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
178
18 The Romans tried me and wanted to
release me, for they found no cause for
the death sentence.
19 But when the Jewish leaders
protested the decision, I felt it necessary
to appeal to Caesar, even though I had
no desire to press charges against my
own people.
20 I asked you to come here today
so we could get acquainted and so I
could tell you that I am bound with this
chain because I believe that the hope
of Israel––the Messiah––has already
come."
21 They replied, "We have heard nothing
against you. We have had no le ers from
Judea or reports from anyone who has
arrived here.
22 But we want to hear what you
believe, for the only thing we know
about these Chris ans is that they are
denounced everywhere."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
23 So a
179
me was set, and on that day
a large number of people came to
Paul’s house. He told them about the
Kingdom of God and taught them about
Jesus from the Scriptures––from the
ﬁve books of Moses and the books of
the prophets. He began lecturing in the
morning and went on into the evening.
24 Some believed and some didn’t.
25 But a er they had argued back and
forth among themselves, they le with
this ﬁnal word from Paul: "The Holy
Spirit was right when he said to our
ancestors through Isaiah the prophet,
26 ‘Go and say to my people, You
will hear my words, but you will not
understand; you will see what I do, but
you will not perceive its meaning.
27 For the hearts of these people are
hardened, and their ears cannot hear,
and they have closed their eyes––so
their eyes cannot see, and their earsACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
180
cannot hear, and their hearts cannot
understand, and they cannot turn to me
and let me heal them.’
28 So I want you to realize that this
salva on from God is also available to
the Gen les, and they will accept it."
29 [[EMPTY]]
30 For the next two years, Paul lived in
his own rented house. He welcomed all
who visited him,
31 proclaiming the Kingdom of God with
all boldness and teaching about the Lord
Jesus Christ. And no one tried to stop
him.Romans
1 This le
er is from Paul, Jesus
Christ’s slave, chosen by God to be
an apostle and sent out to preach his
Good News.
2 This Good News was promised long
ago by God through his prophets in the
holy Scriptures.
3 It is the Good News about his Son,
Jesus, who came as a man, born into
King David’s royal family line.
4 And Jesus Christ our Lord was
shown to be the Son of God when God
powerfully raised him from the dead by
means of the Holy Spirit.
5 Through Christ, God has given us the
privilege and authority to tell Gen les
everywhere what God has done for

him, bringing glory to his name.

12 I’m eager to encourage you in your
faith, but I also want to be encouraged
by yours. In this way, each of us will be a
blessing to the other.
13 I want you to know, dear brothers
and sisters, that I planned many mes to
visit you, but I was prevented un l now.
I want to work among you and see good
results, just as I have done among other
Gen les.
14 For I have a great sense of obliga on
to people in our culture and to people
in other cultures, to the educated and
uneducated alike.
15 So I am eager to come to you in
Rome, too, to preach God’s Good News.
16 For I am not ashamed of this Good
News about Christ. It is the power ofROMANS 1
4
God at work, saving everyone who
believes––Jews ﬁrst and also Gen les.
17 This Good News tells us how God
makes us right in his sight. This is
accomplished from start to ﬁnish by
faith. As the Scriptures say, "It is through
faith that a righteous person has life."
18 But God shows his anger from heaven
against all sinful, wicked people who
push the truth away from themselves.
19 For the truth about God is known
to them ins nc vely. God has put this
knowledge in their hearts.
20 From the me the world was created,
people have seen the earth and sky and
all that God made. They can clearly see
his invisible quali es––his eternal power
and divine nature. So they have no
excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.
21 Yes, they knew God, but they
wouldn’t worship him as God or even
give him thanks. And they began to thinkROMANS 1
5
up foolish ideas of what God was like.
The result was that their minds became
dark and confused.
22 Claiming to be wise, they became
u er fools instead.
23 And instead of worshiping the
glorious, ever–living God, they
worshiped idols made to look like mere
people, or birds and animals and snakes.
24 So God let them go ahead and do
whatever shameful things their hearts
desired. As a result, they did vile and
degrading things with each other’s
bodies.
25 Instead of believing what they
knew was the truth about God, they
deliberately chose to believe lies. So
they worshiped the things God made
but not the Creator himself, who is to be
praised forever. Amen.
26 That is why God abandoned them to
their shameful desires. Even the womenROMANS 1
6
turned against the natural way to have
sex and instead indulged in sex with
each other.
27 And the men, instead of having
normal sexual rela onships with
women, burned with lust for each other.
Men did shameful things with other
men and, as a result, suﬀered within
themselves the penalty they so richly
deserved.
28 When they refused to acknowledge
God, he abandoned them to their evil
minds and let them do things that should
never be done.
29 Their lives became full of every kind
of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy,
murder, ﬁgh ng, decep on, malicious
behavior, and gossip.
30 They are backstabbers, haters of God,
insolent, proud, and boas ul. They are
forever inven ng new ways of sinning
and are disobedient to their parents.ROMANS 1 – 2
7
31 They refuse to understand, break
their promises, and are heartless and
unforgiving.
32 They are fully aware of God’s death
penalty for those who do these things,
yet they go right ahead and do them
anyway. And, worse yet, they encourage
others to do them, too.
1 You may be saying, "What terrible
people you have been talking
about!" But you are just as bad, and you
have no excuse! When you say they are
wicked and should be punished, you are
condemning yourself, for you do these
very same things.
2 And we know that God, in his jus ce,
will punish anyone who does such
things.
3 Do you think that God will judge and
condemn others for doing them and not
judge you when you do them, too?
2ROMANS 2
8
4 Don’t you realize how kind, tolerant,
and pa ent God is with you? Or don’t
you care? Can’t you see how kind he
has been in giving you me to turn from
your sin?
5 But no, you won’t listen. So you
are storing up terrible punishment for
yourself because of your stubbornness in
refusing to turn from your sin. For there
is going to come a day of judgment when
God, the just judge of all the world,
6 will judge all people according to what
they have done.
7 He will give eternal life to those
who persist in doing what is good,
seeking a er the glory and honor and
immortality that God oﬀers.
8 But he will pour out his anger and
wrath on those who live for themselves,
who refuse to obey the truth and
prac ce evil deeds.ROMANS 2
9
9 There will be trouble and calamity for
everyone who keeps on sinning––for the
Jew ﬁrst and also for the Gen le.
10 But there will be glory and honor
and peace from God for all who do
good––for the Jew ﬁrst and also for the
Gen le.
11 For God does not show favori sm.
12 God will punish the Gen les when
they sin, even though they never had
God’s wri en law. And he will punish the
Jews when they sin, for they do have the
law.
13 For it is not merely knowing the law
that brings God’s approval. Those who
obey the law will be declared right in
God’s sight.
14 Even when Gen les, who do not have
God’s wri en law, ins nc vely follow
what the law says, they show that in
their hearts they know right from wrong.ROMANS 2
10
15 They demonstrate that God’s law
is wri en within them, for their own
consciences either accuse them or tell
them they are doing what is right.
16 The day will surely come when God,
by Jesus Christ, will judge everyone’s
secret life. This is my message.
17 If you are a Jew, you are relying on
God’s law for your special rela onship
with him. You boast that all is well
between yourself and God.
18 Yes, you know what he wants; you
know right from wrong because you
have been taught his law.
19 You are convinced that you are a
guide for the blind and a beacon light for
people who are lost in darkness without
God.
20 You think you can instruct the
ignorant and teach children the ways of
God. For you are certain that in God’sROMANS 2
11
law you have complete knowledge and
truth.
21 Well then, if you teach others, why
don’t you teach yourself? You tell others
not to steal, but do you steal?
22 You say it is wrong to commit
adultery, but do you do it? You condemn
idolatry, but do you steal from pagan
temples?
23 You are so proud of knowing the law,
but you dishonor God by breaking it.
24 No wonder the Scriptures say, "The
world blasphemes the name of God
because of you."
25 The Jewish ceremony of circumcision
is worth something only if you obey
God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s
law, you are no be er oﬀ than an
uncircumcised Gen le.
26 And if the Gen les obey God’s law,
won’t God give them all the rights and
honors of being his own people?ROMANS 2 – 3
27 In fact, uncircumcised Gen
12
les who
keep God’s law will be much be er oﬀ
than you Jews who are circumcised and
know so much about God’s law but don’t
obey it.
28 For you are not a true Jew just
because you were born of Jewish
parents or because you have gone
through the Jewish ceremony of
circumcision.
29 No, a true Jew is one whose heart is
right with God. And true circumcision is
not a cu ng of the body but a change of
heart produced by God’s Spirit. Whoever
has that kind of change seeks praise
from God, not from people.
1 Then what’s the advantage of being
a Jew? Is there any value in the
Jewish ceremony of circumcision?
2 Yes, being a Jew has many advantages.
First of all, the Jews were entrusted with
the whole revela on of God.
3ROMANS 3
13
3 True, some of them were unfaithful;
but just because they broke their
promises, does that mean God will break
his promises?
4 Of course not! Though everyone else
in the world is a liar, God is true. As the
Scriptures say, "He will be proved right in
what he says, and he will win his case in
court."
5 "But," some say, "our sins serve a
good purpose, for people will see God’s
goodness when he declares us sinners to
be innocent. Isn’t it unfair, then, for God
to punish us?" (That is actually the way
some people talk.)
6 Of course not! If God is not just, how
is he qualiﬁed to judge the world?
7 "But," some might s ll argue, "how
can God judge and condemn me as
a sinner if my dishonesty highlights
his truthfulness and brings him more
glory?"ROMANS 3
14
8 If you follow that kind of thinking,
however, you might as well say that
the more we sin the be er it is! Those
who say such things deserve to be
condemned, yet some slander me by
saying this is what I preach!
9 Well then, are we Jews be er than
others? No, not at all, for we have
already shown that all people, whether
Jews or Gen les, are under the power of
sin.
10 As the Scriptures say, "No one is
good––not even one.
11 No one has real understanding; no
one is seeking God.
12 All have turned away from God; all
have gone wrong. No one does good,
not even one."
13 "Their talk is foul, like the stench
from an open grave. Their speech is ﬁlled
with lies." "The poison of a deadly snake
drips from their lips."ROMANS 3
15
14 "Their mouths are full of cursing and
bi erness."
15 "They are quick to commit murder.
16 Wherever they go, destruc on and
misery follow them.
17 They do not know what true peace
is."
18 "They have no fear of God to restrain
them."
19 Obviously, the law applies to those
to whom it was given, for its purpose is
to keep people from having excuses and
to bring the en re world into judgment
before God.
20 For no one can ever be made right
in God’s sight by doing what his law
commands. For the more we know God’s
law, the clearer it becomes that we
aren’t obeying it.
21 But now God has shown us a diﬀerent
way of being right in his sight––not byROMANS 3
16
obeying the law but by the way promised
in the Scriptures long ago.
22 We are made right in God’s sight
when we trust in Jesus Christ to take
away our sins. And we all can be saved
in this same way, no ma er who we are
or what we have done.
23 For all have sinned; all fall short of
God’s glorious standard.
24 Yet now God in his gracious kindness
declares us not guilty. He has done this
through Christ Jesus, who has freed us
by taking away our sins.
25 For God sent Jesus to take the
punishment for our sins and to sa sfy
God’s anger against us. We are made
right with God when we believe that
Jesus shed his blood, sacriﬁcing his life
for us. God was being en rely fair and
just when he did not punish those who
sinned in former mes.ROMANS 3
26 And he is en
17
rely fair and just in this
present me when he declares sinners
to be right in his sight because they
believe in Jesus.
27 Can we boast, then, that we have
done anything to be accepted by God?
No, because our acqui al is not based
on our good deeds. It is based on our
faith.
28 So we are made right with God
through faith and not by obeying the
law.
29 A er all, God is not the God of the
Jews only, is he? Isn’t he also the God of
the Gen les? Of course he is.
30 There is only one God, and there
is only one way of being accepted by
him. He makes people right with himself
only by faith, whether they are Jews or
Gen les.
31 Well then, if we emphasize faith,
does this mean that we can forget aboutROMANS 4
18
the law? Of course not! In fact, only
when we have faith do we truly fulﬁll the
law.
1 Abraham was, humanly speaking,
the founder of our Jewish na on.
What were his experiences concerning
this ques on of being saved by faith?
2 Was it because of his good deeds that
God accepted him? If so, he would have
had something to boast about. But from
God’s point of view Abraham had no
basis at all for pride.
3 For the Scriptures tell us, "Abraham
believed God, so God declared him to be
righteous."
4 When people work, their wages are
not a gi . Workers earn what they
receive.
5 But people are declared righteous
because of their faith, not because of
their work.
4ROMANS 4
19
6 King David spoke of this, describing
the happiness of an undeserving sinner
who is declared to be righteous:
7 "Oh, what joy for those whose
disobedience is forgiven, whose sins are
put out of sight.
8 Yes, what joy for those whose sin is
no longer counted against them by the
Lord."
9 Now then, is this blessing only for
the Jews, or is it for Gen les, too? Well,
what about Abraham? We have been
saying he was declared righteous by God
because of his faith.
10 But how did his faith help him? Was
he declared righteous only a er he had
been circumcised, or was it before he
was circumcised? The answer is that
God accepted him ﬁrst, and then he was
circumcised later!
11 The circumcision ceremony was a
sign that Abraham already had faith andROMANS 4
20
that God had already accepted him and
declared him to be righteous––even
before he was circumcised. So Abraham
is the spiritual father of those who have
faith but have not been circumcised.
They are made right with God by faith.
12 And Abraham is also the spiritual
father of those who have been
circumcised, but only if they have the
same kind of faith Abraham had before
he was circumcised.
13 It is clear, then, that God’s promise
to give the whole earth to Abraham
and his descendants was not based on
obedience to God’s law, but on the new
rela onship with God that comes by
faith.
14 So if you claim that God’s promise is
for those who obey God’s law and think
they are "good enough" in God’s sight,
then you are saying that faith is useless.ROMANS 4
21
And in that case, the promise is also
meaningless.
15 But the law brings punishment on
those who try to obey it. (The only way
to avoid breaking the law is to have no
law to break!)
16 So that’s why faith is the key! God’s
promise is given to us as a free gi . And
we are certain to receive it, whether or
not we follow Jewish customs, if we have
faith like Abraham’s. For Abraham is the
father of all who believe.
17 That is what the Scriptures mean
when God told him, "I have made
you the father of many na ons." This
happened because Abraham believed
in the God who brings the dead back to
life and who brings into existence what
didn’t exist before.
18 When God promised Abraham that
he would become the father of many
na ons, Abraham believed him. GodROMANS 4
22
had also said, "Your descendants will
be as numerous as the stars," even
though such a promise seemed u erly
impossible!
19 And Abraham’s faith did not weaken,
even though he knew that he was too
old to be a father at the age of one
hundred and that Sarah, his wife, had
never been able to have children.
20 Abraham never wavered in believing
God’s promise. In fact, his faith grew
stronger, and in this he brought glory to
God.
21 He was absolutely convinced that
God was able to do anything he
promised.
22 And because of Abraham’s faith, God
declared him to be righteous.
23 Now this wonderful truth––that God
declared him to be righteous––wasn’t
just for Abraham’s beneﬁt.ROMANS 4 – 5
23
24 It was for us, too, assuring us that
God will also declare us to be righteous
if we believe in God, who brought Jesus
our Lord back from the dead.
25 He was handed over to die because
of our sins, and he was raised from the
dead to make us right with God.
1 Therefore, since we have been
made right in God’s sight by faith, we
have peace with God because of what
Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us.
2 Because of our faith, Christ has
brought us into this place of highest
privilege where we now stand, and we
conﬁdently and joyfully look forward to
sharing God’s glory.
3 We can rejoice, too, when we run into
problems and trials, for we know that
they are good for us––they help us learn
to endure.
4 And endurance develops strength
of character in us, and character
5ROMANS 5
24
strengthens our conﬁdent expecta on
of salva on.
5 And this expecta on will not
disappoint us. For we know how dearly
God loves us, because he has given us
the Holy Spirit to ﬁll our hearts with his
love.
6 When we were u erly helpless, Christ
came at just the right me and died for
us sinners.
7 Now, no one is likely to die for a
good person, though someone might
be willing to die for a person who is
especially good.
8 But God showed his great love for us
by sending Christ to die for us while we
were s ll sinners.
9 And since we have been made right in
God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will
certainly save us from God’s judgment.
10 For since we were restored to
friendship with God by the death of hisROMANS 5
25
Son while we were s ll his enemies, we
will certainly be delivered from eternal
punishment by his life.
11 So now we can rejoice in our
wonderful new rela onship with God––
all because of what our Lord Jesus Christ
has done for us in making us friends of
God.
12 When Adam sinned, sin entered the
en re human race. Adam’s sin brought
death, so death spread to everyone, for
everyone sinned.
13 Yes, people sinned even before the
law was given. And though there was no
law to break, since it had not yet been
given,
14 they all died anyway––even though
they did not disobey an explicit
commandment of God, as Adam did.
What a contrast between Adam and
Christ, who was yet to come!ROMANS 5
26
15 And what a diﬀerence between
our sin and God’s generous gi of
forgiveness. For this one man, Adam,
brought death to many through his sin.
But this other man, Jesus Christ, brought
forgiveness to many through God’s
boun ful gi .
16 And the result of God’s gracious gi
is very diﬀerent from the result of that
one man’s sin. For Adam’s sin led to
condemna on, but we have the free gi
of being accepted by God, even though
we are guilty of many sins.
17 The sin of this one man, Adam,
caused death to rule over us, but all who
receive God’s wonderful, gracious gi of
righteousness will live in triumph over
sin and death through this one man,
Jesus Christ.
18 Yes, Adam’s one sin brought
condemna on upon everyone, but
Christ’s one act of righteousness makesROMANS 5 – 6
27
all people right in God’s sight and gives
them life.
19 Because one person disobeyed
God, many people became sinners. But
because one other person obeyed God,
many people will be made right in God’s
sight.
20 God’s law was given so that all
people could see how sinful they were.
But as people sinned more and more,
God’s wonderful kindness became more
abundant.
21 So just as sin ruled over all people
and brought them to death, now God’s
wonderful kindness rules instead, giving
us right standing with God and resul ng
in eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord.
1 Well then, should we keep on
sinning so that God can show
us more and more kindness and
forgiveness?
6ROMANS 6
28
2 Of course not! Since we have died to
sin, how can we con nue to live in it?
3 Or have you forgo en that when we
became Chris ans and were bap zed to
become one with Christ Jesus, we died
with him?
4 For we died and were buried with
Christ by bap sm. And just as Christ was
raised from the dead by the glorious
power of the Father, now we also may
live new lives.
5 Since we have been united with him
in his death, we will also be raised as he
was.
6 Our old sinful selves were cruciﬁed
with Christ so that sin might lose its
power in our lives. We are no longer
slaves to sin.
7 For when we died with Christ we were
set free from the power of sin.
8 And since we died with Christ, we
know we will also share his new life.ROMANS 6
29
9 We are sure of this because Christ
rose from the dead, and he will never die
again. Death no longer has any power
over him.
10 He died once to defeat sin, and now
he lives for the glory of God.
11 So you should consider yourselves
dead to sin and able to live for the glory
of God through Christ Jesus.
12 Do not let sin control the way you
live; do not give in to its lus ul desires.
13 Do not let any part of your body
become a tool of wickedness, to be
used for sinning. Instead, give yourselves
completely to God since you have been
given new life. And use your whole body
as a tool to do what is right for the glory
of God.
14 Sin is no longer your master, for you
are no longer subject to the law, which
enslaves you to sin. Instead, you are free
by God’s grace.ROMANS 6
30
15 So since God’s grace has set us free
from the law, does this mean we can go
on sinning? Of course not!
16 Don’t you realize that whatever you
choose to obey becomes your master?
You can choose sin, which leads to
death, or you can choose to obey God
and receive his approval.
17 Thank God! Once you were slaves of
sin, but now you have obeyed with all
your heart the new teaching God has
given you.
18 Now you are free from sin, your old
master, and you have become slaves to
your new master, righteousness.
19 I speak this way, using the illustra on
of slaves and masters, because it is easy
to understand. Before, you let yourselves
be slaves of impurity and lawlessness.
Now you must choose to be slaves of
righteousness so that you will become
holy.ROMANS 6 – 7
31
20 In those days, when you were slaves
of sin, you weren’t concerned with doing
what was right.
21 And what was the result? It was not
good, since now you are ashamed of the
things you used to do, things that end in
eternal doom.
22 But now you are free from the power
of sin and have become slaves of God.
Now you do those things that lead to
holiness and result in eternal life.
23 For the wages of sin is death, but the
free gi of God is eternal life through
Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 Now, dear brothers and sisters
––you who are familiar with the
law––don’t you know that the law
applies only to a person who is s ll
living?
2 Let me illustrate. When a woman
marries, the law binds her to her
husband as long as he is alive. But if he
7ROMANS 7
32
dies, the laws of marriage no longer
apply to her.
3 So while her husband is alive, she
would be commi ng adultery if she
married another man. But if her husband
dies, she is free from that law and
does not commit adultery when she
remarries.
4 So this is the point: The law no longer
holds you in its power, because you died
to its power when you died with Christ
on the cross. And now you are united
with the one who was raised from the
dead. As a result, you can produce good
fruit, that is, good deeds for God.
5 When we were controlled by our
old nature, sinful desires were at work
within us, and the law aroused these
evil desires that produced sinful deeds,
resul ng in death.
6 But now we have been released from
the law, for we died with Christ, and weROMANS 7
33
are no longer cap ve to its power. Now
we can really serve God, not in the old
way by obeying the le er of the law, but
in the new way, by the Spirit.
7 Well then, am I sugges ng that the
law of God is evil? Of course not! The
law is not sinful, but it was the law that
showed me my sin. I would never have
known that cove ng is wrong if the law
had not said, "Do not covet."
8 But sin took advantage of this law and
aroused all kinds of forbidden desires
within me! If there were no law, sin
would not have that power.
9 I felt ﬁne when I did not understand
what the law demanded. But when I
learned the truth, I realized I had broken
the law and was a sinner, doomed to die.
10 So the good law, which was supposed
to show me the way of life, instead gave
me the death penalty.ROMANS 7
34
11 Sin took advantage of the law and
fooled me; it took the good law and used
it to make me guilty of death.
12 But s ll, the law itself is holy and
right and good.
13 But how can that be? Did the law,
which is good, cause my doom? Of
course not! Sin used what was good to
bring about my condemna on. So we
can see how terrible sin really is. It uses
God’s good commandment for its own
evil purposes.
14 The law is good, then. The trouble is
not with the law but with me, because
I am sold into slavery, with sin as my
master.
15 I don’t understand myself at all, for
I really want to do what is right, but I
don’t do it. Instead, I do the very thing I
hate.ROMANS 7
35
16 I know perfectly well that what I am
doing is wrong, and my bad conscience
shows that I agree that the law is good.
17 But I can’t help myself, because it is
sin inside me that makes me do these
evil things.
18 I know I am ro en through and
through so far as my old sinful nature is
concerned. No ma er which way I turn,
I can’t make myself do right. I want to,
but I can’t.
19 When I want to do good, I don’t.
And when I try not to do wrong, I do it
anyway.
20 But if I am doing what I don’t want to
do, I am not really the one doing it; the
sin within me is doing it.
21 It seems to be a fact of life that when
I want to do what is right, I inevitably do
what is wrong.
22 I love God’s law with all my heart.ROMANS 7 – 8
36
23 But there is another law at work
within me that is at war with my mind.
This law wins the ﬁght and makes me a
slave to the sin that is s ll within me.
24 Oh, what a miserable person I am!
Who will free me from this life that is
dominated by sin?
25 Thank God! The answer is in Jesus
Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In
my mind I really want to obey God’s law,
but because of my sinful nature I am a
slave to sin.
1 So now there is no condemna on
for those who belong to Christ Jesus.
2 For the power of the life–giving Spirit
has freed you through Christ Jesus from
the power of sin that leads to death.
3 The law of Moses could not save us,
because of our sinful nature. But God
put into eﬀect a diﬀerent plan to save
us. He sent his own Son in a human body
like ours, except that ours are sinful. God
8ROMANS 8
37
destroyed sin’s control over us by giving
his Son as a sacriﬁce for our sins.
4 He did this so that the requirement
of the law would be fully accomplished
for us who no longer follow our sinful
nature but instead follow the Spirit.
5 Those who are dominated by the
sinful nature think about sinful things,
but those who are controlled by the Holy
Spirit think about things that please the
Spirit.
6 If your sinful nature controls your
mind, there is death. But if the Holy
Spirit controls your mind, there is life
and peace.
7 For the sinful nature is always hos le
to God. It never did obey God’s laws, and
it never will.
8 That’s why those who are s ll under
the control of their sinful nature can
never please God.ROMANS 8
38
9 But you are not controlled by your
sinful nature. You are controlled by the
Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living
in you. (And remember that those who
do not have the Spirit of Christ living in
them are not Chris ans at all.)
10 Since Christ lives within you, even
though your body will die because of
sin, your spirit is alive because you have
been made right with God.
11 The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus
from the dead, lives in you. And just
as he raised Christ from the dead, he
will give life to your mortal body by this
same Spirit living within you.
12 So, dear brothers and sisters, you
have no obliga on whatsoever to do
what your sinful nature urges you to do.
13 For if you keep on following it, you
will perish. But if through the power of
the Holy Spirit you turn from it and its
evil deeds, you will live.ROMANS 8
39
14 For all who are led by the Spirit of
God are children of God.
15 So you should not be like cowering,
fearful slaves. You should behave instead
like God’s very own children, adopted
into his family ––calling him "Father,
dear Father."
16 For his Holy Spirit speaks to us deep
in our hearts and tells us that we are
God’s children.
17 And since we are his children, we will
share his treasures––for everything God
gives to his Son, Christ, is ours, too. But
if we are to share his glory, we must also
share his suﬀering.
18 Yet what we suﬀer now is nothing
compared to the glory he will give us
later.
19 For all crea on is wai ng eagerly for
that future day when God will reveal
who his children really are.ROMANS 8
40
20 Against its will, everything on earth
was subjected to God’s curse.
21 All crea on an cipates the day when
it will join God’s children in glorious
freedom from death and decay.
22 For we know that all crea on
has been groaning as in the pains of
childbirth right up to the present me.
23 And even we Chris ans, although
we have the Holy Spirit within us as a
foretaste of future glory, also groan to
be released from pain and suﬀering. We,
too, wait anxiously for that day when
God will give us our full rights as his
children, including the new bodies he
has promised us.
24 Now that we are saved, we eagerly
look forward to this freedom. For if you
already have something, you don’t need
to hope for it.ROMANS 8
41
25 But if we look forward to something
we don’t have yet, we must wait
pa ently and conﬁdently.
26 And the Holy Spirit helps us in our
distress. For we don’t even know what
we should pray for, nor how we should
pray. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with
groanings that cannot be expressed in
words.
27 And the Father who knows all hearts
knows what the Spirit is saying, for the
Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony
with God’s own will.
28 And we know that God causes
everything to work together for the good
of those who love God and are called
according to his purpose for them.
29 For God knew his people in advance,
and he chose them to become like
his Son, so that his Son would be the
ﬁrstborn, with many brothers and
sisters.ROMANS 8
42
30 And having chosen them, he called
them to come to him. And he gave
them right standing with himself, and he
promised them his glory.
31 What can we say about such
wonderful things as these? If God is for
us, who can ever be against us?
32 Since God did not spare even his own
Son but gave him up for us all, won’t
God, who gave us Christ, also give us
everything else?
33 Who dares accuse us whom God has
chosen for his own? Will God? No! He is
the one who has given us right standing
with himself.
34 Who then will condemn us? Will
Christ Jesus? No, for he is the one who
died for us and was raised to life for
us and is si ng at the place of highest
honor next to God, pleading for us.
35 Can anything ever separate us from
Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longerROMANS 8
43
loves us if we have trouble or calamity,
or are persecuted, or are hungry or cold
or in danger or threatened with death?
36 (Even the Scriptures say, "For your
sake we are killed every day; we are
being slaughtered like sheep.")
37 No, despite all these things,
overwhelming victory is ours through
Christ, who loved us.
38 And I am convinced that nothing can
ever separate us from his love. Death
can’t, and life can’t. The angels can’t,
and the demons can’t. Our fears for
today, our worries about tomorrow, and
even the powers of hell can’t keep God’s
love away.
39 Whether we are high above the sky
or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all
crea on will ever be able to separate us
from the love of God that is revealed in
Christ Jesus our Lord.ROMANS 9
9
44
1 In the presence of Christ, I speak
with u er truthfulness––I do not
lie––and my conscience and the Holy
Spirit conﬁrm that what I am saying is
true.
2 My heart is ﬁlled with bi er sorrow
and unending grief
3 for my people, my Jewish brothers
and sisters. I would be willing to be
forever cursed––cut oﬀ from Christ!––if
that would save them.
4 They are the people of Israel, chosen
to be God’s special children. God
revealed his glory to them. He made
covenants with them and gave his
law to them. They have the privilege
of worshiping him and receiving his
wonderful promises.
5 Their ancestors were great people of
God, and Christ himself was a Jew as far
as his human nature is concerned. AndROMANS 9
45
he is God, who rules over everything and
is worthy of eternal praise! Amen.
6 Well then, has God failed to fulﬁll
his promise to the Jews? No, for not
everyone born into a Jewish family is
truly a Jew!
7 Just the fact that they are descendants
of Abraham doesn’t make them truly
Abraham’s children. For the Scriptures
say, "Isaac is the son through whom your
descendants will be counted," though
Abraham had other children, too.
8 This means that Abraham’s physical
descendants are not necessarily children
of God. It is the children of the promise
who are considered to be Abraham’s
children.
9 For God had promised, "Next year I
will return, and Sarah will have a son."
10 This son was our ancestor Isaac.
When he grew up, he married Rebekah,
who gave birth to twins.ROMANS 9
46
11 But before they were born, before
they had done anything good or bad,
she received a message from God.
(This message proves that God chooses
according to his own plan,
12 not according to our good or bad
works.) She was told, "The descendants
of your older son will serve the
descendants of your younger son."
13 In the words of the Scriptures, "I
loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau."
14 What can we say? Was God being
unfair? Of course not!
15 For God said to Moses, "I will show
mercy to anyone I choose, and I will
show compassion to anyone I choose."
16 So receiving God’s promise is not up
to us. We can’t get it by choosing it or
working hard for it. God will show mercy
to anyone he chooses.
17 For the Scriptures say that God told
Pharaoh, "I have appointed you for theROMANS 9
47
very purpose of displaying my power in
you, and so that my fame might spread
throughout the earth."
18 So you see, God shows mercy to
some just because he wants to, and he
chooses to make some people refuse to
listen.
19 Well then, you might say, "Why does
God blame people for not listening?
Haven’t they simply done what he made
them do?"
20 No, don’t say that. Who are you, a
mere human being, to cri cize God?
Should the thing that was created say to
the one who made it, "Why have you
made me like this?"
21 When a po er makes jars out of
clay, doesn’t he have a right to use
the same lump of clay to make one jar
for decora on and another to throw
garbage into?ROMANS 9
48
22 God has every right to exercise his
judgment and his power, but he also has
the right to be very pa ent with those
who are the objects of his judgment and
are ﬁt only for destruc on.
23 He also has the right to pour out
the riches of his glory upon those
he prepared to be the objects of his
mercy––
24 even upon us, whom he selected,
both from the Jews and from the
Gen les.
25 Concerning the Gen les, God says
in the prophecy of Hosea, "Those who
were not my people, I will now call my
people. And I will love those whom I did
not love before."
26 And, "Once they were told, ‘You are
not my people.’ But now he will say, ‘You
are children of the living God.’"
27 Concerning Israel, Isaiah the prophet
cried out, "Though the people of IsraelROMANS 9
49
are as numerous as the sand on the
seashore, only a small number will be
saved.
28 For the Lord will carry out his
sentence upon the earth quickly and
with ﬁnality."
29 And Isaiah said in another place, "If
the Lord Almighty had not spared a few
of us, we would have been wiped out as
completely as Sodom and Gomorrah."
30 Well then, what shall we say about
these things? Just this: The Gen les have
been made right with God by faith, even
though they were not seeking him.
31 But the Jews, who tried so hard to
get right with God by keeping the law,
never succeeded.
32 Why not? Because they were trying
to get right with God by keeping the law
and being good instead of by depending
on faith. They stumbled over the great
rock in their path.ROMANS 9 – 10
50
33 God warned them of this in the
Scriptures when he said, "I am placing a
stone in Jerusalem that causes people
to stumble, and a rock that makes them
fall. But anyone who believes in him will
not be disappointed."
1 Dear brothers and sisters, the
longing of my heart and my
prayer to God is that the Jewish people
might be saved.
2 I know what enthusiasm they have for
God, but it is misdirected zeal.
3 For they don’t understand God’s way
of making people right with himself.
Instead, they are clinging to their own
way of ge ng right with God by trying to
keep the law. They won’t go along with
God’s way.
4 For Christ has accomplished the whole
purpose of the law. All who believe in
him are made right with God.
10ROMANS 10
51
5 For Moses wrote that the law’s way of
making a person right with God requires
obedience to all of its commands.
6 But the way of ge ng right with God
through faith says, "You don’t need to go
to heaven" (to ﬁnd Christ and bring him
down to help you).
7 And it says, "You don’t need to go to
the place of the dead" (to bring Christ
back to life again).
8 Salva on that comes from trus ng
Christ––which is the message we
preach––is already within easy reach. In
fact, the Scriptures say, "The message is
close at hand; it is on your lips and in
your heart."
9 For if you confess with your mouth
that Jesus is Lord and believe in your
heart that God raised him from the
dead, you will be saved.
10 For it is by believing in your heart
that you are made right with God, andROMANS 10
52
it is by confessing with your mouth that
you are saved.
11 As the Scriptures tell us, "Anyone
who believes in him will not be
disappointed."
12 Jew and Gen le are the same in this
respect. They all have the same Lord,
who generously gives his riches to all
who ask for them.
13 For "Anyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved."
14 But how can they call on him to save
them unless they believe in him? And
how can they believe in him if they have
never heard about him? And how can
they hear about him unless someone
tells them?
15 And how will anyone go and tell them
without being sent? That is what the
Scriptures mean when they say, "How
beau ful are the feet of those who bring
good news!"ROMANS 10
53
16 But not everyone welcomes the
Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said,
"Lord, who has believed our message?"
17 Yet faith comes from listening to this
message of good news––the Good News
about Christ.
18 But what about the Jews? Have they
actually heard the message? Yes, they
have: "The message of God’s crea on
has gone out to everyone, and its words
to all the world."
19 But did the people of Israel really
understand? Yes, they did, for even in
the me of Moses, God had said, "I will
rouse your jealousy by blessing other
na ons. I will make you angry by blessing
the foolish Gen les."
20 And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God:
"I was found by people who were not
looking for me. I showed myself to those
who were not asking for me."ROMANS 10 – 11
54
21 But regarding Israel, God said, "All
day long I opened my arms to them, but
they kept disobeying me and arguing
with me."
1 I ask, then, has God rejected
his people, the Jews? Of course
not! Remember that I myself am a Jew, a
descendant of Abraham and a member
of the tribe of Benjamin.
2 No, God has not rejected his own
people, whom he chose from the very
beginning. Do you remember what the
Scriptures say about this? Elijah the
prophet complained to God about the
people of Israel and said,
3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets
and torn down your altars. I alone am
le , and now they are trying to kill me,
too."
4 And do you remember God’s reply?
He said, "You are not the only one le .
11ROMANS 11
55
I have seven thousand others who have
never bowed down to Baal!"
5 It is the same today, for not all the
Jews have turned away from God. A
few are being saved as a result of God’s
kindness in choosing them.
6 And if they are saved by God’s
kindness, then it is not by their good
works. For in that case, God’s wonderful
kindness would not be what it really
is––free and undeserved.
7 So this is the situa on: Most of the
Jews have not found the favor of God
they are looking for so earnestly. A few
have––the ones God has chosen––but
the rest were made unresponsive.
8 As the Scriptures say, "God has put
them into a deep sleep. To this very day
he has shut their eyes so they do not
see, and closed their ears so they do not
hear."ROMANS 11
56
9 David spoke of this same thing when
he said, "Let their boun ful table
become a snare, a trap that makes them
think all is well. Let their blessings cause
them to stumble.
10 Let their eyes go blind so they cannot
see, and let their backs grow weaker and
weaker."
11 Did God’s people stumble and fall
beyond recovery? Of course not! His
purpose was to make his salva on
available to the Gen les, and then the
Jews would be jealous and want it for
themselves.
12 Now if the Gen les were enriched
because the Jews turned down God’s
oﬀer of salva on, think how much
greater a blessing the world will share
when the Jews ﬁnally accept it.
13 I am saying all of this especially for
you Gen les. God has appointed me asROMANS 11
57
the apostle to the Gen les. I lay great
stress on this,
14 for I want to ﬁnd a way to make the
Jews want what you Gen les have, and
in that way I might save some of them.
15 For since the Jews’ rejec on meant
that God oﬀered salva on to the rest of
the world, how much more wonderful
their acceptance will be. It will be life for
those who were dead!
16 And since Abraham and the other
patriarchs were holy, their children will
also be holy. For if the roots of the tree
are holy, the branches will be, too.
17 But some of these branches from
Abraham’s tree, some of the Jews, have
been broken oﬀ. And you Gen les, who
were branches from a wild olive tree,
were gra ed in. So now you also receive
the blessing God has promised Abraham
and his children, sharing in God’s rich
nourishment of his special olive tree.ROMANS 11
58
18 But you must be careful not to
brag about being gra ed in to replace
the branches that were broken oﬀ.
Remember, you are just a branch, not
the root.
19 "Well," you may say, "those branches
were broken oﬀ to make room for me."
20 Yes, but remember––those branches,
the Jews, were broken oﬀ because they
didn’t believe God, and you are there
because you do believe. Don’t think
highly of yourself, but fear what could
happen.
21 For if God did not spare the branches
he put there in the ﬁrst place, he won’t
spare you either.
22 No ce how God is both kind and
severe. He is severe to those who
disobeyed, but kind to you as you
con nue to trust in his kindness. But if
you stop trus ng, you also will be cut oﬀ.ROMANS 11
59
23 And if the Jews turn from their
unbelief, God will gra them back into
the tree again. He has the power to do it.
24 For if God was willing to take you
who were, by nature, branches from
a wild olive tree and gra you into his
own good tree––a very unusual thing to
do––he will be far more eager to gra
the Jews back into the tree where they
belong.
25 I want you to understand this
mystery, dear brothers and sisters, so
that you will not feel proud and start
bragging. Some of the Jews have hard
hearts, but this will last only un l the
complete number of Gen les comes to
Christ.
26 And so all Israel will be saved. Do
you remember what the prophets said
about this? "A Deliverer will come from
Jerusalem, and he will turn Israel from
all ungodliness.ROMANS 11
60
27 And then I will keep my covenant
with them and take away their sins."
28 Many of the Jews are now enemies
of the Good News. But this has been to
your beneﬁt, for God has given his gi s
to you Gen les. Yet the Jews are s ll his
chosen people because of his promises
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
29 For God’s gi s and his call can never
be withdrawn.
30 Once, you Gen les were rebels
against God, but when the Jews refused
his mercy, God was merciful to you
instead.
31 And now, in the same way, the Jews
are the rebels, and God’s mercy has
come to you. But someday they, too, will
share in God’s mercy.
32 For God has imprisoned all people in
their own disobedience so he could have
mercy on everyone.ROMANS 11 – 12
61
33 Oh, what a wonderful God we have!
How great are his riches and wisdom
and knowledge! How impossible it is for
us to understand his decisions and his
methods!
34 For who can know what the Lord is
thinking? Who knows enough to be his
counselor?
35 And who could ever give him so
much that he would have to pay it back?
36 For everything comes from him;
everything exists by his power and is
intended for his glory. To him be glory
evermore. Amen.
1 And so, dear brothers and
sisters, I plead with you to give
your bodies to God. Let them be a living
and holy sacriﬁce––the kind he will
accept. When you think of what he has
done for you, is this too much to ask?
2 Don’t copy the behavior and customs
of this world, but let God transform you
12ROMANS 12
62
into a new person by changing the way
you think. Then you will know what God
wants you to do, and you will know how
good and pleasing and perfect his will
really is.
3 As God’s messenger, I give each of you
this warning: Be honest in your es mate
of yourselves, measuring your value by
how much faith God has given you.
4 Just as our bodies have many parts
and each part has a special func on,
5 so it is with Christ’s body. We are all
parts of his one body, and each of us
has diﬀerent work to do. And since we
are all one body in Christ, we belong to
each other, and each of us needs all the
others.
6 God has given each of us the ability
to do certain things well. So if God has
given you the ability to prophesy, speak
out when you have faith that God is
speaking through you.ROMANS 12
7 If your gi
63
is that of serving others,
serve them well. If you are a teacher, do
a good job of teaching.
8 If your gi is to encourage others, do
it! If you have money, share it generously.
If God has given you leadership ability,
take the responsibility seriously. And if
you have a gi for showing kindness to
others, do it gladly.
9 Don’t just pretend that you love
others. Really love them. Hate what is
wrong. Stand on the side of the good.
10 Love each other with genuine
aﬀec on, and take delight in honoring
each other.
11 Never be lazy in your work, but serve
the Lord enthusias cally.
12 Be glad for all God is planning for
you. Be pa ent in trouble, and always be
prayerful.
13 When God’s children are in need, be
the one to help them out. And get intoROMANS 12
64
the habit of invi ng guests home for
dinner or, if they need lodging, for the
night.
14 If people persecute you because you
are a Chris an, don’t curse them; pray
that God will bless them.
15 When others are happy, be happy
with them. If they are sad, share their
sorrow.
16 Live in harmony with each other.
Don’t try to act important, but enjoy the
company of ordinary people. And don’t
think you know it all!
17 Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
Do things in such a way that everyone
can see you are honorable.
18 Do your part to live in peace with
everyone, as much as possible.
19 Dear friends, never avenge
yourselves. Leave that to God. For it is
wri en, "I will take vengeance; I willROMANS 12 – 13
65
repay those who deserve it," says the
Lord.
20 Instead, do what the Scriptures say:
"If your enemies are hungry, feed them.
If they are thirsty, give them something
to drink, and they will be ashamed of
what they have done to you."
21 Don’t let evil get the best of you, but
conquer evil by doing good.
1 Obey the government, for God
is the one who put it there. All
governments have been placed in power
by God.
2 So those who refuse to obey the laws
of the land are refusing to obey God, and
punishment will follow.
3 For the authori es do not frighten
people who are doing right, but they
frighten those who do wrong. So do
what they say, and you will get along
well.
13ROMANS 13
4 The authori
66
es are sent by God to
help you. But if you are doing something
wrong, of course you should be afraid,
for you will be punished. The authori es
are established by God for that very
purpose, to punish those who do wrong.
5 So you must obey the government
for two reasons: to keep from being
punished and to keep a clear conscience.
6 Pay your taxes, too, for these same
reasons. For government workers need
to be paid so they can keep on doing the
work God intended them to do.
7 Give to everyone what you owe them:
Pay your taxes and import du es, and
give respect and honor to all to whom it
is due.
8 Pay all your debts, except the debt
of love for others. You can never ﬁnish
paying that! If you love your neighbor,
you will fulﬁll all the requirements of
God’s law.ROMANS 13
67
9 For the commandments against
adultery and murder and stealing
and cove ng––and any other
commandment––are all summed
up in this one commandment: "Love
your neighbor as yourself."
10 Love does no wrong to anyone, so
love sa sﬁes all of God’s requirements.
11 Another reason for right living is that
you know how late it is; me is running
out. Wake up, for the coming of our
salva on is nearer now than when we
ﬁrst believed.
12 The night is almost gone; the day of
salva on will soon be here. So don’t live
in darkness. Get rid of your evil deeds.
Shed them like dirty clothes. Clothe
yourselves with the armor of right living,
as those who live in the light.
13 We should be decent and true in
everything we do, so that everyone
can approve of our behavior. Don’tROMANS 13 – 14
68
par cipate in wild par es and ge ng
drunk, or in adultery and immoral living,
or in ﬁgh ng and jealousy.
14 But let the Lord Jesus Christ take
control of you, and don’t think of ways
to indulge your evil desires.
1 Accept Chris ans who are weak
in faith, and don’t argue with
them about what they think is right or
wrong.
2 For instance, one person believes it
is all right to eat anything. But another
believer who has a sensi ve conscience
will eat only vegetables.
3 Those who think it is all right to eat
anything must not look down on those
who won’t. And those who won’t eat
certain foods must not condemn those
who do, for God has accepted them.
4 Who are you to condemn God’s
servants? They are responsible to the
Lord, so let him tell them whether they
14ROMANS 14
69
are right or wrong. The Lord’s power will
help them do as they should.
5 In the same way, some think one
day is more holy than another day,
while others think every day is alike.
Each person should have a personal
convic on about this ma er.
6 Those who have a special day for
worshiping the Lord are trying to honor
him. Those who eat all kinds of food do
so to honor the Lord, since they give
thanks to God before ea ng. And those
who won’t eat everything also want to
please the Lord and give thanks to God.
7 For we are not our own masters when
we live or when we die.
8 While we live, we live to please the
Lord. And when we die, we go to be
with the Lord. So in life and in death, we
belong to the Lord.
9 Christ died and rose again for this very
purpose, so that he might be Lord ofROMANS 14
70
those who are alive and of those who
have died.
10 So why do you condemn another
Chris an? Why do you look down on
another Chris an? Remember, each
of us will stand personally before the
judgment seat of God.
11 For the Scriptures say, "‘As surely
as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will
bow to me and every tongue will confess
allegiance to God.’"
12 Yes, each of us will have to give a
personal account to God.
13 So don’t condemn each other
anymore. Decide instead to live in such a
way that you will not put an obstacle in
another Chris an’s path.
14 I know and am perfectly sure on the
authority of the Lord Jesus that no food,
in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if
someone believes it is wrong, then for
that person it is wrong.ROMANS 14
15 And if another Chris
71
an is distressed
by what you eat, you are not ac ng in
love if you eat it. Don’t let your ea ng
ruin someone for whom Christ died.
16 Then you will not be condemned for
doing something you know is all right.
17 For the Kingdom of God is not a
ma er of what we eat or drink, but of
living a life of goodness and peace and
joy in the Holy Spirit.
18 If you serve Christ with this a tude,
you will please God. And other people
will approve of you, too.
19 So then, let us aim for harmony in the
church and try to build each other up.
20 Don’t tear apart the work of God
over what you eat. Remember, there
is nothing wrong with these things
in themselves. But it is wrong to eat
anything if it makes another person
stumble.ROMANS 14 – 15
72
21 Don’t eat meat or drink wine or do
anything else if it might cause another
Chris an to stumble.
22 You may have the faith to believe
that there is nothing wrong with what
you are doing, but keep it between
yourself and God. Blessed are those who
do not condemn themselves by doing
something they know is all right.
23 But if people have doubts about
whether they should eat something,
they shouldn’t eat it. They would be
condemned for not ac ng in faith before
God. If you do anything you believe is
not right, you are sinning.
1 We may know that these
things make no diﬀerence,
but we cannot just go ahead and do
them to please ourselves. We must be
considerate of the doubts and fears of
those who think these things are wrong.
15ROMANS 15
73
2 We should please others. If we do
what helps them, we will build them up
in the Lord.
3 For even Christ didn’t please himself.
As the Scriptures say, "Those who insult
you are also insul ng me."
4 Such things were wri en in the
Scriptures long ago to teach us. They
give us hope and encouragement as we
wait pa ently for God’s promises.
5 May God, who gives this pa ence
and encouragement, help you live in
complete harmony with each other––
each with the a tude of Christ Jesus
toward the other.
6 Then all of you can join together with
one voice, giving praise and glory to God,
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7 So accept each other just as Christ has
accepted you; then God will be gloriﬁed.
8 Remember that Christ came as a
servant to the Jews to show that God isROMANS 15
74
true to the promises he made to their
ancestors.
9 And he came so the Gen les might
also give glory to God for his mercies to
them. That is what the psalmist meant
when he wrote: "I will praise you among
the Gen les; I will sing praises to your
name."
10 And in another place it is wri en,
"Rejoice, O you Gen les, along with his
people, the Jews."
11 And yet again, "Praise the Lord, all
you Gen les; praise him, all you people
of the earth."
12 And the prophet Isaiah said, "The
heir to David’s throne will come, and
he will rule over the Gen les. They will
place their hopes on him."
13 So I pray that God, who gives you
hope, will keep you happy and full of
peace as you believe in him. May youROMANS 15
75
overﬂow with hope through the power
of the Holy Spirit.
14 I am fully convinced, dear brothers
and sisters, that you are full of goodness.
You know these things so well that you
are able to teach others all about them.
15 Even so, I have been bold enough
to emphasize some of these points,
knowing that all you need is this
reminder from me. For I am, by God’s
grace,
16 a special messenger from Christ Jesus
to you Gen les. I bring you the Good
News and oﬀer you up as a fragrant
sacriﬁce to God so that you might be
pure and pleasing to him by the Holy
Spirit.
17 So it is right for me to be enthusias c
about all Christ Jesus has done through
me in my service to God.
18 I dare not boast of anything else. I
have brought the Gen les to God by myROMANS 15
76
message and by the way I lived before
them.
19 I have won them over by the miracles
done through me as signs from God––all
by the power of God’s Spirit. In this way,
I have fully presented the Good News of
Christ all the way from Jerusalem clear
over into Illyricum.
20 My ambi on has always been to
preach the Good News where the name
of Christ has never been heard, rather
than where a church has already been
started by someone else.
21 I have been following the plan spoken
of in the Scriptures, where it says, "Those
who have never been told about him will
see, and those who have never heard of
him will understand."
22 In fact, my visit to you has been
delayed so long because I have been
preaching in these places.ROMANS 15
77
23 But now I have ﬁnished my work in
these regions, and a er all these long
years of wai ng, I am eager to visit you.
24 I am planning to go to Spain, and
when I do, I will stop oﬀ in Rome. And
a er I have enjoyed your fellowship for a
li le while, you can send me on my way
again.
25 But before I come, I must go down to
Jerusalem to take a gi to the Chris ans
there.
26 For you see, the believers in Greece
have eagerly taken up an oﬀering for the
Chris ans in Jerusalem, who are going
through such hard mes.
27 They were very glad to do this
because they feel they owe a real debt
to them. Since the Gen les received
the wonderful spiritual blessings of the
Good News from the Jewish Chris ans,
they feel the least they can do in return
is help them ﬁnancially.ROMANS 15
78
28 As soon as I have delivered this
money and completed this good deed of
theirs, I will come to see you on my way
to Spain.
29 And I am sure that when I come,
Christ will give me a great blessing for
you.
30 Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to
join me in my struggle by praying to God
for me. Do this because of your love for
me, given to you by the Holy Spirit.
31 Pray that I will be rescued from
those in Judea who refuse to obey God.
Pray also that the Chris ans there will
be willing to accept the dona on I am
bringing them.
32 Then, by the will of God, I will be able
to come to you with a happy heart, and
we will be an encouragement to each
other.ROMANS 15 – 16
79
33 And now may God, who gives us his
peace, be with you all. Amen.
1 Our sister Phoebe, a deacon in
the church in Cenchrea, will be
coming to see you soon.
2 Receive her in the Lord, as one who is
worthy of high honor. Help her in every
way you can, for she has helped many in
their needs, including me.
3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila. They have
been co–workers in my ministry for
Christ Jesus.
4 In fact, they risked their lives for me. I
am not the only one who is thankful to
them; so are all the Gen le churches.
5 Please give my gree ngs to the church
that meets in their home. Greet my dear
friend Epenetus. He was the very ﬁrst
person to become a Chris an in the
province of Asia.
6 Give my gree ngs to Mary, who has
worked so hard for your beneﬁt.
16ROMANS 16
80
7 Then there are Andronicus and Junia,
my rela ves, who were in prison with
me. They are respected among the
apostles and became Chris ans before I
did. Please give them my gree ngs.
8 Say hello to Ampliatus, whom I love as
one of the Lord’s own children,
9 and Urbanus, our co–worker in Christ,
and beloved Stachys.
10 Give my gree ngs to Apelles, a good
man whom Christ approves. And give
my best regards to the members of the
household of Aristobulus.
11 Greet Herodion, my rela ve. Greet
the Chris ans in the household of
Narcissus.
12 Say hello to Tryphena and Tryphosa,
the Lord’s workers, and to dear Persis,
who has worked so hard for the Lord.
13 Greet Rufus, whom the Lord picked
out to be his very own; and also his dear
mother, who has been a mother to me.ROMANS 16
14 And please give my gree
81
ngs to
Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas,
Hermas, and the brothers and sisters
who are with them.
15 Give my gree ngs to Philologus, Julia,
Nereus and his sister, and to Olympas
and all the other believers who are with
them.
16 Greet each other in Chris an love.
All the churches of Christ send you their
gree ngs.
17 And now I make one more appeal,
my dear brothers and sisters. Watch
out for people who cause divisions and
upset people’s faith by teaching things
that are contrary to what you have been
taught. Stay away from them.
18 Such people are not serving Christ
our Lord; they are serving their own
personal interests. By smooth talk and
glowing words they deceive innocent
people.ROMANS 16
82
19 But everyone knows that you are
obedient to the Lord. This makes me
very happy. I want you to see clearly
what is right and to stay innocent of any
wrong.
20 The God of peace will soon crush
Satan under your feet. May the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
21 Timothy, my fellow worker, and
Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my
rela ves, send you their good wishes.
22 I, Ter us, the one who is wri ng this
le er for Paul, send my gree ngs, too, as
a Chris an brother.
23 Gaius says hello to you. I am his
guest, and the church meets here in his
home. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends
you his gree ngs, and so does Quartus,
a Chris an brother.
24 [[EMPTY]]
25 God is able to make you strong, just
as the Good News says. It is the messageROMANS 16
83
about Jesus Christ and his plan for you
Gen les, a plan kept secret from the
beginning of me.
26 But now as the prophets foretold and
as the eternal God has commanded, this
message is made known to all Gen les
everywhere, so that they might believe
and obey Christ.
27 To God, who alone is wise, be the
glory forever through Jesus Christ.
Amen.1 Corinthians
1 This le
er is from Paul, chosen
by the will of God to be an apostle
of Christ Jesus, and from our brother
Sosthenes.
2 We are wri ng to the church of God
in Corinth, you who have been called by
God to be his own holy people. He made
you holy by means of Christ Jesus, just
as he did all Chris ans everywhere––
whoever calls upon the name of Jesus
Christ, our Lord and theirs.
3 May God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ give you his grace and peace.
4 I can never stop thanking God for all
the generous gi s he has given you, now
that you belong to Christ Jesus.
11 CORINTHIANS 1
2
5 He has enriched your church with
the gi s of eloquence and every kind of
knowledge.
6 This shows that what I told you about
Christ is true.
7 Now you have every spiritual gi you
need as you eagerly wait for the return
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
8 He will keep you strong right up to the
end, and he will keep you free from all
blame on the great day when our Lord
Jesus Christ returns.
9 God will surely do this for you, for
he always does just what he says, and
he is the one who invited you into this
wonderful friendship with his Son, Jesus
Christ our Lord.
10 Now, dear brothers and sisters, I
appeal to you by the authority of the
Lord Jesus Christ to stop arguing among
yourselves. Let there be real harmony so
there won’t be divisions in the church. I1 CORINTHIANS 1
3
plead with you to be of one mind, united
in thought and purpose.
11 For some members of Chloe’s
household have told me about your
arguments, dear brothers and sisters.
12 Some of you are saying, "I am a
follower of Paul." Others are saying, "I
follow Apollos," or "I follow Peter," or "I
follow only Christ."
13 Can Christ be divided into pieces?
Was I, Paul, cruciﬁed for you? Were any
of you bap zed in the name of Paul?
14 I thank God that I did not bap ze any
of you except Crispus and Gaius,
15 for now no one can say they were
bap zed in my name.
16 (Oh yes, I also bap zed the
household of Stephanas. I don’t
remember bap zing anyone else.)
17 For Christ didn’t send me to bap ze,
but to preach the Good News––and not
with clever speeches and high–sounding1 CORINTHIANS 1
4
ideas, for fear that the cross of Christ
would lose its power.
18 I know very well how foolish the
message of the cross sounds to those
who are on the road to destruc on. But
we who are being saved recognize this
message as the very power of God.
19 As the Scriptures say, "I will destroy
human wisdom and discard their most
brilliant ideas."
20 So where does this leave the
philosophers, the scholars, and the
world’s brilliant debaters? God has made
them all look foolish and has shown their
wisdom to be useless nonsense.
21 Since God in his wisdom saw to it that
the world would never ﬁnd him through
human wisdom, he has used our foolish
preaching to save all who believe.
22 God’s way seems foolish to the Jews
because they want a sign from heaven
to prove it is true. And it is foolish to the1 CORINTHIANS 1
5
Greeks because they believe only what
agrees with their own wisdom.
23 So when we preach that Christ was
cruciﬁed, the Jews are oﬀended, and the
Gen les say it’s all nonsense.
24 But to those called by God to
salva on, both Jews and Gen les, Christ
is the mighty power of God and the
wonderful wisdom of God.
25 This "foolish" plan of God is far wiser
than the wisest of human plans, and
God’s weakness is far stronger than the
greatest of human strength.
26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters,
that few of you were wise in the world’s
eyes, or powerful, or wealthy when God
called you.
27 Instead, God deliberately chose
things the world considers foolish in
order to shame those who think they
are wise. And he chose those who are1 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
6
powerless to shame those who are
powerful.
28 God chose things despised by the
world, things counted as nothing at all,
and used them to bring to nothing what
the world considers important,
29 so that no one can ever boast in the
presence of God.
30 God alone made it possible for you
to be in Christ Jesus. For our beneﬁt
God made Christ to be wisdom itself. He
is the one who made us acceptable to
God. He made us pure and holy, and he
gave himself to purchase our freedom.
31 As the Scriptures say, "The person
who wishes to boast should boast only
of what the Lord has done."
1 Dear brothers and sisters, when I
ﬁrst came to you I didn’t use lo y
words and brilliant ideas to tell you
God’s message.
21 CORINTHIANS 2
7
2 For I decided to concentrate only on
Jesus Christ and his death on the cross.
3 I came to you in weakness–– mid and
trembling.
4 And my message and my preaching
were very plain. I did not use wise and
persuasive speeches, but the Holy Spirit
was powerful among you.
5 I did this so that you might trust
the power of God rather than human
wisdom.
6 Yet when I am among mature
Chris ans, I do speak with words of
wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that
belongs to this world, and not the kind
that appeals to the rulers of this world,
who are being brought to nothing.
7 No, the wisdom we speak of is the
secret wisdom of God, which was hidden
in former mes, though he made it for
our beneﬁt before the world began.1 CORINTHIANS 2
8
8 But the rulers of this world have not
understood it; if they had, they would
never have cruciﬁed our glorious Lord.
9 That is what the Scriptures mean
when they say, "No eye has seen, no ear
has heard, and no mind has imagined
what God has prepared for those who
love him."
10 But we know these things because
God has revealed them to us by his Spirit,
and his Spirit searches out everything
and shows us even God’s deep secrets.
11 No one can know what anyone else is
really thinking except that person alone,
and no one can know God’s thoughts
except God’s own Spirit.
12 And God has actually given us his
Spirit (not the world’s spirit) so we can
know the wonderful things God has
freely given us.
13 When we tell you this, we do not
use words of human wisdom. We speak1 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
9
words given to us by the Spirit, using the
Spirit’s words to explain spiritual truths.
14 But people who aren’t Chris ans
can’t understand these truths from
God’s Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them
because only those who have the Spirit
can understand what the Spirit means.
15 We who have the Spirit understand
these things, but others can’t understand
us at all.
16 How could they? For, "Who can know
what the Lord is thinking? Who can give
him counsel?" But we can understand
these things, for we have the mind of
Christ.
1 Dear brothers and sisters, when I
was with you I couldn’t talk to you
as I would to mature Chris ans. I had
to talk as though you belonged to this
world or as though you were infants in
the Chris an life.
31 CORINTHIANS 3
10
2 I had to feed you with milk and not
with solid food, because you couldn’t
handle anything stronger. And you s ll
aren’t ready,
3 for you are s ll controlled by your own
sinful desires. You are jealous of one
another and quarrel with each other.
Doesn’t that prove you are controlled
by your own desires? You are ac ng like
people who don’t belong to the Lord.
4 When one of you says, "I am a follower
of Paul," and another says, "I prefer
Apollos," aren’t you ac ng like those
who are not Chris ans?
5 Who is Apollos, and who is Paul, that
we should be the cause of such quarrels?
Why, we’re only servants. Through us
God caused you to believe. Each of us
did the work the Lord gave us.
6 My job was to plant the seed in your
hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was
God, not we, who made it grow.1 CORINTHIANS 3
7 The ones who do the plan
11
ng or
watering aren’t important, but God is
important because he is the one who
makes the seed grow.
8 The one who plants and the one who
waters work as a team with the same
purpose. Yet they will be rewarded
individually, according to their own hard
work.
9 We work together as partners who
belong to God. You are God’s ﬁeld, God’s
building––not ours.
10 Because of God’s special favor to
me, I have laid the founda on like an
expert builder. Now others are building
on it. But whoever is building on this
founda on must be very careful.
11 For no one can lay any other
founda on than the one we already
have––Jesus Christ.1 CORINTHIANS 3
12
12 Now anyone who builds on that
founda on may use gold, silver, jewels,
wood, hay, or straw.
13 But there is going to come a me of
tes ng at the judgment day to see what
kind of work each builder has done.
Everyone’s work will be put through the
ﬁre to see whether or not it keeps its
value.
14 If the work survives the ﬁre, that
builder will receive a reward.
15 But if the work is burned up, the
builder will suﬀer great loss. The builders
themselves will be saved, but like
someone escaping through a wall of
ﬂames.
16 Don’t you realize that all of you
together are the temple of God and that
the Spirit of God lives in you?
17 God will bring ruin upon anyone who
ruins this temple. For God’s temple is
holy, and you Chris ans are that temple.1 CORINTHIANS 3
13
18 Stop fooling yourselves. If you think
you are wise by this world’s standards,
you will have to become a fool so you
can become wise by God’s standards.
19 For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say,
"God catches those who think they are
wise in their own cleverness."
20 And again, "The Lord knows the
thoughts of the wise, that they are
worthless."
21 So don’t take pride in following a
par cular leader. Everything belongs to
you:
22 Paul and Apollos and Peter; the
whole world and life and death; the
present and the future. Everything
belongs to you,
23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ
belongs to God.1 CORINTHIANS 4
4
14
1 So look at Apollos and me as mere
servants of Christ who have been put
in charge of explaining God’s secrets.
2 Now, a person who is put in charge as
a manager must be faithful.
3 What about me? Have I been faithful?
Well, it ma ers very li le what you or
anyone else thinks. I don’t even trust my
own judgment on this point.
4 My conscience is clear, but that isn’t
what ma ers. It is the Lord himself who
will examine me and decide.
5 So be careful not to jump to
conclusions before the Lord returns as
to whether or not someone is faithful.
When the Lord comes, he will bring our
deepest secrets to light and will reveal
our private mo ves. And then God will
give to everyone whatever praise is due.
6 Dear brothers and sisters, I have used
Apollos and myself to illustrate what I’ve
been saying. If you pay a en on to the1 CORINTHIANS 4
15
Scriptures, you won’t brag about one of
your leaders at the expense of another.
7 What makes you be er than anyone
else? What do you have that God hasn’t
given you? And if all you have is from
God, why boast as though you have
accomplished something on your own?
8 You think you already have everything
you need! You are already rich! Without
us you have become kings! I wish you
really were on your thrones already, for
then we would be reigning with you!
9 But some mes I think God has put
us apostles on display, like prisoners
of war at the end of a victor’s parade,
condemned to die. We have become a
spectacle to the en re world––to people
and angels alike.
10 Our dedica on to Christ makes us
look like fools, but you are so wise! We
are weak, but you are so powerful! You1 CORINTHIANS 4
16
are well thought of, but we are laughed
at.
11 To this very hour we go hungry
and thirsty, without enough clothes to
keep us warm. We have endured many
bea ngs, and we have no homes of our
own.
12 We have worked wearily with our
own hands to earn our living. We bless
those who curse us. We are pa ent with
those who abuse us.
13 We respond gently when evil things
are said about us. Yet we are treated like
the world’s garbage, like everybody’s
trash––right up to the present moment.
14 I am not wri ng these things to
shame you, but to warn you as my
beloved children.
15 For even if you had ten thousand
others to teach you about Christ, you
have only one spiritual father. For I1 CORINTHIANS 4
17
became your father in Christ Jesus when
I preached the Good News to you.
16 So I ask you to follow my example
and do as I do.
17 That is the very reason I am sending
Timothy––to help you do this. For he is
my beloved and trustworthy child in the
Lord. He will remind you of what I teach
about Christ Jesus in all the churches
wherever I go.
18 I know that some of you have
become arrogant, thinking I will never
visit you again.
19 But I will come––and soon––if the
Lord will let me, and then I’ll ﬁnd out
whether these arrogant people are just
big talkers or whether they really have
God’s power.
20 For the Kingdom of God is not just
fancy talk; it is living by God’s power.1 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
18
21 Which do you choose? Should I come
with punishment and scolding, or should
I come with quiet love and gentleness?
1 I can hardly believe the report
about the sexual immorality going
on among you, something so evil that
even the pagans don’t do it. I am told
that you have a man in your church who
is living in sin with his father’s wife.
2 And you are so proud of yourselves!
Why aren’t you mourning in sorrow and
shame? And why haven’t you removed
this man from your fellowship?
3 Even though I am not there with you
in person, I am with you in the Spirit.
Concerning the one who has done this, I
have already passed judgment
4 in the name of the Lord Jesus. You are
to call a mee ng of the church, and I will
be there in spirit, and the power of the
Lord Jesus will be with you as you meet.
51 CORINTHIANS 5
19
5 Then you must cast this man out of
the church and into Satan’s hands, so
that his sinful nature will be destroyed
and he himself will be saved when the
Lord returns.
6 How terrible that you should boast
about your spirituality, and yet you let
this sort of thing go on. Don’t you realize
that if even one person is allowed to go
on sinning, soon all will be aﬀected?
7 Remove this wicked person from
among you so that you can stay pure.
Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been
sacriﬁced for us.
8 So let us celebrate the fes val, not
by ea ng the old bread of wickedness
and evil, but by ea ng the new bread of
purity and truth.
9 When I wrote to you before, I told
you not to associate with people who
indulge in sexual sin.1 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
20
10 But I wasn’t talking about unbelievers
who indulge in sexual sin, or who
are greedy or are swindlers or idol
worshipers. You would have to leave this
world to avoid people like that.
11 What I meant was that you are not to
associate with anyone who claims to be
a Chris an yet indulges in sexual sin, or
is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive,
or a drunkard, or a swindler. Don’t even
eat with such people.
12 It isn’t my responsibility to judge
outsiders, but it certainly is your job to
judge those inside the church who are
sinning in these ways.
13 God will judge those on the outside;
but as the Scriptures say, "You must
remove the evil person from among
you."
1 When you have something against
another Chris an, why do you ﬁle a
lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide
61 CORINTHIANS 6
21
the ma er, instead of taking it to other
Chris ans to decide who is right?
2 Don’t you know that someday we
Chris ans are going to judge the world?
And since you are going to judge the
world, can’t you decide these li le things
among yourselves?
3 Don’t you realize that we Chris ans
will judge angels? So you should
surely be able to resolve ordinary
disagreements here on earth.
4 If you have legal disputes about such
ma ers, why do you go to outside judges
who are not respected by the church?
5 I am saying this to shame you. Isn’t
there anyone in all the church who is
wise enough to decide these arguments?
6 But instead, one Chris an sues
another––right in front of unbelievers!
7 To have such lawsuits at all is a real
defeat for you. Why not just accept the1 CORINTHIANS 6
22
injus ce and leave it at that? Why not
let yourselves be cheated?
8 But instead, you yourselves are the
ones who do wrong and cheat even your
own Chris an brothers and sisters.
9 Don’t you know that those who do
wrong will have no share in the Kingdom
of God? Don’t fool yourselves. Those
who indulge in sexual sin, who are idol
worshipers, adulterers, male pros tutes,
homosexuals,
10 thieves, greedy people, drunkards,
abusers, and swindlers––none of these
will have a share in the Kingdom of God.
11 There was a me when some of you
were just like that, but now your sins
have been washed away, and you have
been set apart for God. You have been
made right with God because of what
the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of
our God have done for you.1 CORINTHIANS 6
23
12 You may say, "I am allowed to do
anything." But I reply, "Not everything
is good for you." And even though "I
am allowed to do anything," I must not
become a slave to anything.
13 You say, "Food is for the stomach,
and the stomach is for food." This is true,
though someday God will do away with
both of them. But our bodies were not
made for sexual immorality. They were
made for the Lord, and the Lord cares
about our bodies.
14 And God will raise our bodies from
the dead by his marvelous power, just as
he raised our Lord from the dead.
15 Don’t you realize that your bodies are
actually parts of Christ? Should a man
take his body, which belongs to Christ,
and join it to a pros tute? Never!
16 And don’t you know that if a man
joins himself to a pros tute, he becomes1 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
24
one body with her? For the Scriptures
say, "The two are united into one."
17 But the person who is joined to the
Lord becomes one spirit with him.
18 Run away from sexual sin! No other
sin so clearly aﬀects the body as this
one does. For sexual immorality is a sin
against your own body.
19 Or don’t you know that your body is
the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives
in you and was given to you by God? You
do not belong to yourself,
20 for God bought you with a high price.
So you must honor God with your body.
1 Now about the ques ons you asked
in your le er. Yes, it is good to live a
celibate life.
2 But because there is so much sexual
immorality, each man should have his
own wife, and each woman should have
her own husband.
71 CORINTHIANS 7
25
3 The husband should not deprive his
wife of sexual in macy, which is her right
as a married woman, nor should the wife
deprive her husband.
4 The wife gives authority over her body
to her husband, and the husband also
gives authority over his body to his wife.
5 So do not deprive each other of sexual
rela ons. The only excep on to this
rule would be the agreement of both
husband and wife to refrain from sexual
in macy for a limited me, so they can
give themselves more completely to
prayer. A erward they should come
together again so that Satan won’t be
able to tempt them because of their lack
of self–control.
6 This is only my sugges on. It’s not
meant to be an absolute rule.
7 I wish everyone could get along
without marrying, just as I do. But we
are not all the same. God gives some the1 CORINTHIANS 7
26
gi of marriage, and to others he gives
the gi of singleness.
8 Now I say to those who aren’t married
and to widows––it’s be er to stay
unmarried, just as I am.
9 But if they can’t control themselves,
they should go ahead and marry. It’s
be er to marry than to burn with lust.
10 Now, for those who are married I
have a command that comes not from
me, but from the Lord. A wife must not
leave her husband.
11 But if she does leave him, let her
remain single or else go back to him. And
the husband must not leave his wife.
12 Now, I will speak to the rest of you,
though I do not have a direct command
from the Lord. If a Chris an man has
a wife who is an unbeliever and she is
willing to con nue living with him, he
must not leave her.1 CORINTHIANS 7
13 And if a Chris
27
an woman has a
husband who is an unbeliever, and he is
willing to con nue living with her, she
must not leave him.
14 For the Chris an wife brings holiness
to her marriage, and the Chris an
husband brings holiness to his marriage.
Otherwise, your children would not have
a godly inﬂuence, but now they are set
apart for him.
15 (But if the husband or wife who isn’t
a Chris an insists on leaving, let them
go. In such cases the Chris an husband
or wife is not required to stay with them,
for God wants his children to live in
peace.)
16 You wives must remember that your
husbands might be converted because of
you. And you husbands must remember
that your wives might be converted
because of you.1 CORINTHIANS 7
17 You must accept whatever situa
28
on
the Lord has put you in, and con nue on
as you were when God ﬁrst called you.
This is my rule for all the churches.
18 For instance, a man who was
circumcised before he became a believer
should not try to reverse it. And the
man who was uncircumcised when
he became a believer should not be
circumcised now.
19 For it makes no diﬀerence whether
or not a man has been circumcised.
The important thing is to keep God’s
commandments.
20 You should con nue on as you were
when God called you.
21 Are you a slave? Don’t let that worry
you––but if you get a chance to be free,
take it.
22 And remember, if you were a slave
when the Lord called you, the Lord has
now set you free from the awful power1 CORINTHIANS 7
29
of sin. And if you were free when the
Lord called you, you are now a slave of
Christ.
23 God purchased you at a high price.
Don’t be enslaved by the world.
24 So, dear brothers and sisters,
whatever situa on you were in when
you became a believer, stay there in your
new rela onship with God.
25 Now, about the young women who
are not yet married. I do not have a
command from the Lord for them. But
the Lord in his kindness has given me
wisdom that can be trusted, and I will
share it with you.
26 Because of the present crisis, I think
it is best to remain just as you are.
27 If you have a wife, do not end the
marriage. If you do not have a wife, do
not get married.
28 But if you do get married, it is not a
sin. And if a young woman gets married,1 CORINTHIANS 7
30
it is not a sin. However, I am trying to
spare you the extra problems that come
with marriage.
29 Now let me say this, dear brothers
and sisters: The me that remains is
very short, so husbands should not let
marriage be their major concern.
30 Happiness or sadness or wealth
should not keep anyone from doing
God’s work.
31 Those in frequent contact with the
things of the world should make good
use of them without becoming a ached
to them, for this world and all it contains
will pass away.
32 In everything you do, I want you to
be free from the concerns of this life.
An unmarried man can spend his me
doing the Lord’s work and thinking how
to please him.
33 But a married man can’t do that so
well. He has to think about his earthly1 CORINTHIANS 7
31
responsibili es and how to please his
wife.
34 His interests are divided. In the
same way, a woman who is no longer
married or has never been married can
be more devoted to the Lord in body
and in spirit, while the married woman
must be concerned about her earthly
responsibili es and how to please her
husband.
35 I am saying this for your beneﬁt, not
to place restric ons on you. I want you
to do whatever will help you serve the
Lord best, with as few distrac ons as
possible.
36 But if a man thinks he ought to
marry his ﬁanc‚e because he has trouble
controlling his passions and me is
passing, it is all right; it is not a sin. Let
them marry.
37 But if he has decided ﬁrmly not to
marry and there is no urgency and he1 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
32
can control his passion, he does well not
to marry.
38 So the person who marries does well,
and the person who doesn’t marry does
even be er.
39 A wife is married to her husband as
long as he lives. If her husband dies, she
is free to marry whomever she wishes,
but this must be a marriage acceptable
to the Lord.
40 But in my opinion it will be be er
for her if she doesn’t marry again, and I
think I am giving you counsel from God’s
Spirit when I say this.
1 Now let’s talk about food that has
been sacriﬁced to idols. You think
that everyone should agree with your
perfect knowledge. While knowledge
may make us feel important, it is love
that really builds up the church.
2 Anyone who claims to know all the
answers doesn’t really know very much.
81 CORINTHIANS 8
33
3 But the person who loves God is the
one God knows and cares for.
4 So now, what about it? Should we eat
meat that has been sacriﬁced to idols?
Well, we all know that an idol is not
really a god and that there is only one
God and no other.
5 According to some people, there are
many so–called gods and many lords,
both in heaven and on earth.
6 But we know that there is only one
God, the Father, who created everything,
and we exist for him. And there is only
one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom
God made everything and through
whom we have been given life.
7 However, not all Chris ans realize
this. Some are accustomed to thinking
of idols as being real, so when they eat
food that has been oﬀered to idols, they
think of it as the worship of real gods,
and their weak consciences are violated.1 CORINTHIANS 8
34
8 It’s true that we can’t win God’s
approval by what we eat. We don’t miss
out on anything if we don’t eat it, and
we don’t gain anything if we do.
9 But you must be careful with this
freedom of yours. Do not cause a brother
or sister with a weaker conscience to
stumble.
10 You see, this is what can happen:
Weak Chris ans who think it is wrong
to eat this food will see you ea ng in
the temple of an idol. You know there’s
nothing wrong with it, but they will be
encouraged to violate their conscience
by ea ng food that has been dedicated
to the idol.
11 So because of your superior
knowledge, a weak Chris an, for whom
Christ died, will be destroyed.
12 And you are sinning against Christ
when you sin against other Chris ans by1 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
35
encouraging them to do something they
believe is wrong.
13 If what I eat is going to make another
Chris an sin, I will never eat meat again
as long as I live––for I don’t want to
make another Chris an stumble.
1 Do I not have as much freedom as
anyone else? Am I not an apostle?
Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord with my
own eyes? Isn’t it because of my hard
work that you are in the Lord?
2 Even if others think I am not an
apostle, I certainly am to you, for you are
living proof that I am the Lord’s apostle.
3 This is my answer to those who
ques on my authority as an apostle.
4 Don’t we have the right to live in your
homes and share your meals?
5 Don’t we have the right to bring a
Chris an wife along with us as the other
disciples and the Lord’s brothers and
Peter do?
91 CORINTHIANS 9
36
6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have
to work to support ourselves?
7 What soldier has to pay his own
expenses? And have you ever heard
of a farmer who harvests his crop and
doesn’t have the right to eat some of it?
What shepherd takes care of a ﬂock of
sheep and isn’t allowed to drink some of
the milk?
8 And this isn’t merely human opinion.
Doesn’t God’s law say the same thing?
9 For the law of Moses says, "Do not
keep an ox from ea ng as it treads out
the grain." Do you suppose God was
thinking only about oxen when he said
this?
10 Wasn’t he also speaking to us? Of
course he was. Just as farm workers who
plow ﬁelds and thresh the grain expect
a share of the harvest, Chris an workers
should be paid by those they serve.1 CORINTHIANS 9
37
11 We have planted good spiritual seed
among you. Is it too much to ask, in
return, for mere food and clothing?
12 If you support others who preach to
you, shouldn’t we have an even greater
right to be supported? Yet we have never
used this right. We would rather put up
with anything than put an obstacle in
the way of the Good News about Christ.
13 Don’t you know that those who work
in the Temple get their meals from the
food brought to the Temple as oﬀerings?
And those who serve at the altar get a
share of the sacriﬁcial oﬀerings.
14 In the same way, the Lord gave
orders that those who preach the Good
News should be supported by those who
beneﬁt from it.
15 Yet I have never used any of these
rights. And I am not wri ng this to
suggest that I would like to start now.1 CORINTHIANS 9
38
In fact, I would rather die than lose my
dis nc on of preaching without charge.
16 For preaching the Good News is
not something I can boast about. I am
compelled by God to do it. How terrible
for me if I didn’t do it!
17 If I were doing this of my own free
will, then I would deserve payment. But
God has chosen me and given me this
sacred trust, and I have no choice.
18 What then is my pay? It is the
sa sfac on I get from preaching
the Good News without expense to
anyone, never demanding my rights as a
preacher.
19 This means I am not bound to obey
people just because they pay me, yet I
have become a servant of everyone so
that I can bring them to Christ.
20 When I am with the Jews, I become
one of them so that I can bring them to
Christ. When I am with those who follow1 CORINTHIANS 9
39
the Jewish laws, I do the same, even
though I am not subject to the law, so
that I can bring them to Christ.
21 When I am with the Gen les who
do not have the Jewish law, I ﬁt in with
them as much as I can. In this way, I
gain their conﬁdence and bring them to
Christ. But I do not discard the law of
God; I obey the law of Christ.
22 When I am with those who are
oppressed, I share their oppression
so that I might bring them to Christ.
Yes, I try to ﬁnd common ground with
everyone so that I might bring them to
Christ.
23 I do all this to spread the Good News,
and in doing so I enjoy its blessings.
24 Remember that in a race everyone
runs, but only one person gets the prize.
You also must run in such a way that you
will win.1 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
25 All athletes prac
40
ce strict self–
control. They do it to win a prize that will
fade away, but we do it for an eternal
prize.
26 So I run straight to the goal with
purpose in every step. I am not like a
boxer who misses his punches.
27 I discipline my body like an athlete,
training it to do what it should.
Otherwise, I fear that a er preaching to
others I myself might be disqualiﬁed.
1 I don’t want you to forget,
dear brothers and sisters, what
happened to our ancestors in the
wilderness long ago. God guided all of
them by sending a cloud that moved
along ahead of them, and he brought
them all safely through the waters of the
sea on dry ground.
2 As followers of Moses, they were all
bap zed in the cloud and the sea.
101 CORINTHIANS 10
41
3 And all of them ate the same
miraculous food,
4 and all of them drank the same
miraculous water. For they all drank from
the miraculous rock that traveled with
them, and that rock was Christ.
5 Yet a er all this, God was not pleased
with most of them, and he destroyed
them in the wilderness.
6 These events happened as a warning
to us, so that we would not crave evil
things as they did
7 or worship idols as some of them
did. For the Scriptures say, "The people
celebrated with feas ng and drinking,
and they indulged themselves in pagan
revelry."
8 And we must not engage in sexual
immorality as some of them did, causing
23,000 of them to die in one day.1 CORINTHIANS 10
42
9 Nor should we put Christ to the test,
as some of them did and then died from
snakebites.
10 And don’t grumble as some of them
did, for that is why God sent his angel of
death to destroy them.
11 All these events happened to them
as examples for us. They were wri en
down to warn us, who live at the me
when this age is drawing to a close.
12 If you think you are standing strong,
be careful, for you, too, may fall into the
same sin.
13 But remember that the tempta ons
that come into your life are no diﬀerent
from what others experience. And God
is faithful. He will keep the tempta on
from becoming so strong that you
can’t stand up against it. When you are
tempted, he will show you a way out so
that you will not give in to it.1 CORINTHIANS 10
43
14 So, my dear friends, ﬂee from the
worship of idols.
15 You are reasonable people. Decide
for yourselves if what I am about to say
is true.
16 When we bless the cup at the Lord’s
Table, aren’t we sharing in the beneﬁts
of the blood of Christ? And when we
break the loaf of bread, aren’t we
sharing in the beneﬁts of the body of
Christ?
17 And we all eat from one loaf, showing
that we are one body.
18 And think about the na on of Israel;
all who eat the sacriﬁces are united by
that act.
19 What am I trying to say? Am I saying
that the idols to whom the pagans bring
sacriﬁces are real gods and that these
sacriﬁces are of some value?
20 No, not at all. What I am saying is that
these sacriﬁces are oﬀered to demons,1 CORINTHIANS 10
44
not to God. And I don’t want any of you
to be partners with demons.
21 You cannot drink from the cup of the
Lord and from the cup of demons, too.
You cannot eat at the Lord’s Table and at
the table of demons, too.
22 What? Do you dare to rouse the
Lord’s jealousy as Israel did? Do you
think we are stronger than he is?
23 You say, "I am allowed to do
anything"––but not everything is
helpful. You say, "I am allowed to
do anything"––but not everything is
beneﬁcial.
24 Don’t think only of your own good.
Think of other Chris ans and what is
best for them.
25 Here’s what you should do. You
may eat any meat that is sold in the
marketplace. Don’t ask whether or not
it was oﬀered to idols, and then your
conscience won’t be bothered.1 CORINTHIANS 10
45
26 For "the earth is the Lord’s, and
everything in it."
27 If someone who isn’t a Chris an
asks you home for dinner, go ahead;
accept the invita on if you want to. Eat
whatever is oﬀered to you and don’t ask
any ques ons about it. Your conscience
should not be bothered by this.
28 But suppose someone warns you
that this meat has been oﬀered to an
idol. Don’t eat it, out of considera on for
the conscience of the one who told you.
29 It might not be a ma er of conscience
for you, but it is for the other person.
Now, why should my freedom be limited
by what someone else thinks?
30 If I can thank God for the food and
enjoy it, why should I be condemned for
ea ng it?
31 Whatever you eat or drink or
whatever you do, you must do all for the
glory of God.1 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
32 Don’t give oﬀense to Jews or Gen
46
les
or the church of God.
33 That is the plan I follow, too. I try
to please everyone in everything I do. I
don’t just do what I like or what is best
for me, but what is best for them so they
may be saved.
1 And you should follow my
example, just as I follow Christ’s.
2 I am so glad, dear friends, that you
always keep me in your thoughts and
you are following the Chris an teaching
I passed on to you.
3 But there is one thing I want you to
know: A man is responsible to Christ, a
woman is responsible to her husband,
and Christ is responsible to God.
4 A man dishonors Christ if he covers his
head while praying or prophesying.
5 But a woman dishonors her husband
if she prays or prophesies without a
111 CORINTHIANS 11
47
covering on her head, for this is the
same as shaving her head.
6 Yes, if she refuses to wear a head
covering, she should cut oﬀ all her hair.
And since it is shameful for a woman to
have her hair cut or her head shaved,
then she should wear a covering.
7 A man should not wear anything on
his head when worshiping, for man is
God’s glory, made in God’s own image,
but woman is the glory of man.
8 For the ﬁrst man didn’t come from
woman, but the ﬁrst woman came from
man.
9 And man was not made for woman’s
beneﬁt, but woman was made for man.
10 So a woman should wear a covering
on her head as a sign of authority
because the angels are watching.
11 But in rela onships among the Lord’s
people, women are not independent of1 CORINTHIANS 11
48
men, and men are not independent of
women.
12 For although the ﬁrst woman came
from man, all men have been born
from women ever since, and everything
comes from God.
13 What do you think about this? Is
it right for a woman to pray to God in
public without covering her head?
14 Isn’t it obvious that it’s disgraceful
for a man to have long hair?
15 And isn’t it obvious that long hair is a
woman’s pride and joy? For it has been
given to her as a covering.
16 But if anyone wants to argue about
this, all I can say is that we have no other
custom than this, and all the churches of
God feel the same way about it.
17 But now when I men on this next
issue, I cannot praise you. For it sounds
as if more harm than good is done when
you meet together.1 CORINTHIANS 11
49
18 First of all, I hear that there are
divisions among you when you meet as
a church, and to some extent I believe it.
19 But, of course, there must be
divisions among you so that those of you
who are right will be recognized!
20 It’s not the Lord’s Supper you are
concerned about when you come
together.
21 For I am told that some of you hurry
to eat your own meal without sharing
with others. As a result, some go hungry
while others get drunk.
22 What? Is this really true? Don’t
you have your own homes for ea ng
and drinking? Or do you really want to
disgrace the church of God and shame
the poor? What am I supposed to say
about these things? Do you want me to
praise you? Well, I certainly do not!
23 For this is what the Lord himself said,
and I pass it on to you just as I received1 CORINTHIANS 11
50
it. On the night when he was betrayed,
the Lord Jesus took a loaf of bread,
24 and when he had given thanks, he
broke it and said, "This is my body, which
is given for you. Do this in remembrance
of me."
25 In the same way, he took the cup
of wine a er supper, saying, "This cup
is the new covenant between God and
you, sealed by the shedding of my blood.
Do this in remembrance of me as o en
as you drink it."
26 For every me you eat this bread and
drink this cup, you are announcing the
Lord’s death un l he comes again.
27 So if anyone eats this bread or drinks
this cup of the Lord unworthily, that
person is guilty of sinning against the
body and the blood of the Lord.
28 That is why you should examine
yourself before ea ng the bread and
drinking from the cup.1 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
51
29 For if you eat the bread or drink the
cup unworthily, not honoring the body
of Christ, you are ea ng and drinking
God’s judgment upon yourself.
30 That is why many of you are weak
and sick and some have even died.
31 But if we examine ourselves, we will
not be examined by God and judged in
this way.
32 But when we are judged and
disciplined by the Lord, we will not be
condemned with the world.
33 So, dear brothers and sisters, when
you gather for the Lord’s Supper, wait for
each other.
34 If you are really hungry, eat at home
so you won’t bring judgment upon
yourselves when you meet together. I’ll
give you instruc ons about the other
ma ers a er I arrive.
1 And now, dear brothers and
sisters, I will write about the
121 CORINTHIANS 12
52
special abili es the Holy Spirit gives
to each of us, for I must correct your
misunderstandings about them.
2 You know that when you were s ll
pagans you were led astray and swept
along in worshiping speechless idols.
3 So I want you to know how to discern
what is truly from God: No one speaking
by the Spirit of God can curse Jesus, and
no one is able to say, "Jesus is Lord,"
except by the Holy Spirit.
4 Now there are diﬀerent kinds of
spiritual gi s, but it is the same Holy
Spirit who is the source of them all.
5 There are diﬀerent kinds of service in
the church, but it is the same Lord we
are serving.
6 There are diﬀerent ways God works
in our lives, but it is the same God who
does the work through all of us.
7 A spiritual gi is given to each of us as
a means of helping the en re church.1 CORINTHIANS 12
53
8 To one person the Spirit gives the
ability to give wise advice; to another he
gives the gi of special knowledge.
9 The Spirit gives special faith to
another, and to someone else he gives
the power to heal the sick.
10 He gives one person the power to
perform miracles, and to another the
ability to prophesy. He gives someone
else the ability to know whether it is
really the Spirit of God or another spirit
that is speaking. S ll another person is
given the ability to speak in unknown
languages, and another is given the
ability to interpret what is being said.
11 It is the one and only Holy Spirit who
distributes these gi s. He alone decides
which gi each person should have.
12 The human body has many parts, but
the many parts make up only one body.
So it is with the body of Christ.1 CORINTHIANS 12
54
13 Some of us are Jews, some are
Gen les, some are slaves, and some are
free. But we have all been bap zed into
Christ’s body by one Spirit, and we have
all received the same Spirit.
14 Yes, the body has many diﬀerent
parts, not just one part.
15 If the foot says, "I am not a part of
the body because I am not a hand," that
does not make it any less a part of the
body.
16 And if the ear says, "I am not part of
the body because I am only an ear and
not an eye," would that make it any less
a part of the body?
17 Suppose the whole body were an
eye––then how would you hear? Or if
your whole body were just one big ear,
how could you smell anything?
18 But God made our bodies with many
parts, and he has put each part just
where he wants it.1 CORINTHIANS 12
55
19 What a strange thing a body would
be if it had only one part!
20 Yes, there are many parts, but only
one body.
21 The eye can never say to the hand, "I
don’t need you." The head can’t say to
the feet, "I don’t need you."
22 In fact, some of the parts that seem
weakest and least important are really
the most necessary.
23 And the parts we regard as less
honorable are those we clothe with the
greatest care. So we carefully protect
from the eyes of others those parts that
should not be seen,
24 while other parts do not require this
special care. So God has put the body
together in such a way that extra honor
and care are given to those parts that
have less dignity.1 CORINTHIANS 12
56
25 This makes for harmony among the
members, so that all the members care
for each other equally.
26 If one part suﬀers, all the parts suﬀer
with it, and if one part is honored, all the
parts are glad.
27 Now all of you together are Christ’s
body, and each one of you is a separate
and necessary part of it.
28 Here is a list of some of the members
that God has placed in the body of
Christ: ﬁrst are apostles, second are
prophets, third are teachers, then those
who do miracles, those who have the
gi of healing, those who can help
others, those who can get others to work
together, those who speak in unknown
languages.
29 Is everyone an apostle? Of course
not. Is everyone a prophet? No. Are
all teachers? Does everyone have the
power to do miracles?1 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
30 Does everyone have the gi
57
of
healing? Of course not. Does God give
all of us the ability to speak in unknown
languages? Can everyone interpret
unknown languages? No!
31 And in any event, you should desire
the most helpful gi s. First, however, let
me tell you about something else that is
be er than any of them!
1 If I could speak in any language
in heaven or on earth but didn’t
love others, I would only be making
meaningless noise like a loud gong or a
clanging cymbal.
2 If I had the gi of prophecy, and if I
knew all the mysteries of the future and
knew everything about everything, but
didn’t love others, what good would I
be? And if I had the gi of faith so that I
could speak to a mountain and make it
move, without love I would be no good
to anybody.
131 CORINTHIANS 13
58
3 If I gave everything I have to the poor
and even sacriﬁced my body, I could
boast about it; but if I didn’t love others,
I would be of no value whatsoever.
4 Love is pa ent and kind. Love is not
jealous or boas ul or proud
5 or rude. Love does not demand its
own way. Love is not irritable, and it
keeps no record of when it has been
wronged.
6 It is never glad about injus ce but
rejoices whenever the truth wins out.
7 Love never gives up, never loses faith,
is always hopeful, and endures through
every circumstance.
8 Love will last forever, but prophecy
and speaking in unknown languages and
special knowledge will all disappear.
9 Now we know only a li le, and even
the gi of prophecy reveals li le!
10 But when the end comes, these
special gi s will all disappear.1 CORINTHIANS 13 – 14
59
11 It’s like this: When I was a child, I
spoke and thought and reasoned as a
child does. But when I grew up, I put
away childish things.
12 Now we see things imperfectly as
in a poor mirror, but then we will see
everything with perfect clarity. All that I
know now is par al and incomplete, but
then I will know everything completely,
just as God knows me now.
13 There are three things that will
endure––faith, hope, and love––and the
greatest of these is love.
1 Let love be your highest goal,
but also desire the special abili es
the Spirit gives, especially the gi of
prophecy.
2 For if your gi is the ability to speak in
tongues, you will be talking to God but
not to people, since they won’t be able
to understand you. You will be speaking
141 CORINTHIANS 14
60
by the power of the Spirit, but it will all
be mysterious.
3 But one who prophesies is helping
others grow in the Lord, encouraging
and comfor ng them.
4 A person who speaks in tongues is
strengthened personally in the Lord, but
one who speaks a word of prophecy
strengthens the en re church.
5 I wish you all had the gi of speaking
in tongues, but even more I wish you
were all able to prophesy. For prophecy
is a greater and more useful gi than
speaking in tongues, unless someone
interprets what you are saying so that
the whole church can get some good out
of it.
6 Dear brothers and sisters, if I should
come to you talking in an unknown
language, how would that help you? But
if I bring you some revela on or some
special knowledge or some prophecy or1 CORINTHIANS 14
61
some teaching––that is what will help
you.
7 Even musical instruments like the ﬂute
or the harp, though they are lifeless, are
examples of the need for speaking in
plain language. For no one will recognize
the melody unless the notes are played
clearly.
8 And if the bugler doesn’t sound a
clear call, how will the soldiers know
they are being called to ba le?
9 And it’s the same for you. If you
talk to people in a language they don’t
understand, how will they know what
you mean? You might as well be talking
to an empty room.
10 There are so many diﬀerent
languages in the world, and all are
excellent for those who understand
them,
11 but to me they mean nothing. I will
not understand people who speak those1 CORINTHIANS 14
62
languages, and they will not understand
me.
12 Since you are so eager to have
spiritual gi s, ask God for those that will
be of real help to the whole church.
13 So anyone who has the gi of
speaking in tongues should pray also for
the gi of interpreta on in order to tell
people plainly what has been said.
14 For if I pray in tongues, my spirit is
praying, but I don’t understand what I
am saying.
15 Well then, what shall I do? I will do
both. I will pray in the spirit, and I will
pray in words I understand. I will sing
in the spirit, and I will sing in words I
understand.
16 For if you praise God only in the spirit,
how can those who don’t understand
you praise God along with you? How can
they join you in giving thanks when they
don’t understand what you are saying?1 CORINTHIANS 14
63
17 You will be giving thanks very nicely,
no doubt, but it doesn’t help the other
people present.
18 I thank God that I speak in tongues
more than all of you.
19 But in a church mee ng I would much
rather speak ﬁve understandable words
that will help others than ten thousand
words in an unknown language.
20 Dear brothers and sisters, don’t be
childish in your understanding of these
things. Be innocent as babies when it
comes to evil, but be mature and wise in
understanding ma ers of this kind.
21 It is wri en in the Scriptures, "I
will speak to my own people through
unknown languages and through the lips
of foreigners. But even then, they will
not listen to me," says the Lord.
22 So you see that speaking in tongues
is a sign, not for believers, but for1 CORINTHIANS 14
64
unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for
the beneﬁt of believers, not unbelievers.
23 Even so, if unbelievers or people who
don’t understand these things come into
your mee ng and hear everyone talking
in an unknown language, they will think
you are crazy.
24 But if all of you are prophesying,
and unbelievers or people who don’t
understand these things come into your
mee ng, they will be convicted of sin,
and they will be condemned by what
you say.
25 As they listen, their secret thoughts
will be laid bare, and they will fall
down on their knees and worship God,
declaring, "God is really here among
you."
26 Well, my brothers and sisters, let’s
summarize what I am saying. When you
meet, one will sing, another will teach,
another will tell some special revela on1 CORINTHIANS 14
65
God has given, one will speak in an
unknown language, while another will
interpret what is said. But everything
that is done must be useful to all and
build them up in the Lord.
27 No more than two or three should
speak in an unknown language. They
must speak one at a me, and someone
must be ready to interpret what they are
saying.
28 But if no one is present who can
interpret, they must be silent in your
church mee ng and speak in tongues to
God privately.
29 Let two or three prophesy, and let
the others evaluate what is said.
30 But if someone is prophesying and
another person receives a revela on
from the Lord, the one who is speaking
must stop.
31 In this way, all who prophesy will
have a turn to speak, one a er the1 CORINTHIANS 14
66
other, so that everyone will learn and be
encouraged.
32 Remember that people who
prophesy are in control of their spirit
and can wait their turn.
33 For God is not a God of disorder but
of peace, as in all the other churches.
34 Women should be silent during
the church mee ngs. It is not proper
for them to speak. They should be
submissive, just as the law says.
35 If they have any ques ons to ask, let
them ask their husbands at home, for
it is improper for women to speak in
church mee ngs.
36 Do you think that the knowledge of
God’s word begins and ends with you
Corinthians? Well, you are mistaken!
37 If you claim to be a prophet or
think you are very spiritual, you should
recognize that what I am saying is a
command from the Lord himself.1 CORINTHIANS 14 – 15
67
38 But if you do not recognize this, you
will not be recognized.
39 So, dear brothers and sisters, be
eager to prophesy, and don’t forbid
speaking in tongues.
40 But be sure that everything is done
properly and in order.
1 Now let me remind you, dear
brothers and sisters, of the Good
News I preached to you before. You
welcomed it then and s ll do now, for
your faith is built on this wonderful
message.
2 And it is this Good News that saves
you if you ﬁrmly believe it––unless, of
course, you believed something that was
never true in the ﬁrst place.
3 I passed on to you what was most
important and what had also been
passed on to me––that Christ died for
our sins, just as the Scriptures said.
151 CORINTHIANS 15
68
4 He was buried, and he was raised
from the dead on the third day, as the
Scriptures said.
5 He was seen by Peter and then by the
twelve apostles.
6 A er that, he was seen by more than
ﬁve hundred of his followers at one me,
most of whom are s ll alive, though
some have died by now.
7 Then he was seen by James and later
by all the apostles.
8 Last of all, I saw him, too, long a er
the others, as though I had been born at
the wrong me.
9 For I am the least of all the apostles,
and I am not worthy to be called an
apostle a er the way I persecuted the
church of God.
10 But whatever I am now, it is all
because God poured out his special favor
on me––and not without results. For I
have worked harder than all the other1 CORINTHIANS 15
69
apostles, yet it was not I but God who
was working through me by his grace.
11 So it makes no diﬀerence whether I
preach or they preach. The important
thing is that you believed what we
preached to you.
12 But tell me this––since we preach
that Christ rose from the dead, why are
some of you saying there will be no
resurrec on of the dead?
13 For if there is no resurrec on of the
dead, then Christ has not been raised
either.
14 And if Christ was not raised, then all
our preaching is useless, and your trust
in God is useless.
15 And we apostles would all be lying
about God, for we have said that God
raised Christ from the grave, but that
can’t be true if there is no resurrec on
of the dead.1 CORINTHIANS 15
16 If there is no resurrec
70
on of the
dead, then Christ has not been raised.
17 And if Christ has not been raised,
then your faith is useless, and you are
s ll under condemna on for your sins.
18 In that case, all who have died
believing in Christ have perished!
19 And if we have hope in Christ only
for this life, we are the most miserable
people in the world.
20 But the fact is that Christ has been
raised from the dead. He has become
the ﬁrst of a great harvest of those who
will be raised to life again.
21 So you see, just as death came into
the world through a man, Adam, now
the resurrec on from the dead has
begun through another man, Christ.
22 Everyone dies because all of us are
related to Adam, the ﬁrst man. But all
who are related to Christ, the other man,
will be given new life.1 CORINTHIANS 15
71
23 But there is an order to this
resurrec on: Christ was raised ﬁrst; then
when Christ comes back, all his people
will be raised.
24 A er that the end will come, when
he will turn the Kingdom over to God the
Father, having put down all enemies of
every kind.
25 For Christ must reign un l he
humbles all his enemies beneath his
feet.
26 And the last enemy to be destroyed
is death.
27 For the Scriptures say, "God has
given him authority over all things." (Of
course, when it says "authority over all
things," it does not include God himself,
who gave Christ his authority.)
28 Then, when he has conquered all
things, the Son will present himself to
God, so that God, who gave his Son1 CORINTHIANS 15
72
authority over all things, will be u erly
supreme over everything everywhere.
29 If the dead will not be raised, then
what point is there in people being
bap zed for those who are dead? Why
do it unless the dead will someday rise
again?
30 And why should we ourselves be
con nually risking our lives, facing death
hour by hour?
31 For I swear, dear brothers and sisters,
I face death daily. This is as certain as my
pride in what the Lord Jesus Christ has
done in you.
32 And what value was there in ﬁgh ng
wild beasts––those men of Ephesus ––if
there will be no resurrec on from the
dead? If there is no resurrec on, "Let’s
feast and get drunk, for tomorrow we
die!"1 CORINTHIANS 15
73
33 Don’t be fooled by those who say
such things, for "bad company corrupts
good character."
34 Come to your senses and stop
sinning. For to your shame I say that
some of you don’t even know God.
35 But someone may ask, "How will the
dead be raised? What kind of bodies will
they have?"
36 What a foolish ques on! When you
put a seed into the ground, it doesn’t
grow into a plant unless it dies ﬁrst.
37 And what you put in the ground is
not the plant that will grow, but only a
dry li le seed of wheat or whatever it is
you are plan ng.
38 Then God gives it a new body––just
the kind he wants it to have. A diﬀerent
kind of plant grows from each kind of
seed.
39 And just as there are diﬀerent kinds
of seeds and plants, so also there are1 CORINTHIANS 15
74
diﬀerent kinds of ﬂesh––whether of
humans, animals, birds, or ﬁsh.
40 There are bodies in the heavens, and
there are bodies on earth. The glory of
the heavenly bodies is diﬀerent from the
beauty of the earthly bodies.
41 The sun has one kind of glory, while
the moon and stars each have another
kind. And even the stars diﬀer from each
other in their beauty and brightness.
42 It is the same way for the resurrec on
of the dead. Our earthly bodies, which
die and decay, will be diﬀerent when
they are resurrected, for they will never
die.
43 Our bodies now disappoint us, but
when they are raised, they will be full of
glory. They are weak now, but when they
are raised, they will be full of power.
44 They are natural human bodies now,
but when they are raised, they will be
spiritual bodies. For just as there are1 CORINTHIANS 15
75
natural bodies, so also there are spiritual
bodies.
45 The Scriptures tell us, "The ﬁrst
man, Adam, became a living person."
But the last Adam––that is, Christ––is a
life–giving Spirit.
46 What came ﬁrst was the natural
body, then the spiritual body comes
later.
47 Adam, the ﬁrst man, was made from
the dust of the earth, while Christ, the
second man, came from heaven.
48 Every human being has an earthly
body just like Adam’s, but our heavenly
bodies will be just like Christ’s.
49 Just as we are now like Adam, the
man of the earth, so we will someday be
like Christ, the man from heaven.
50 What I am saying, dear brothers and
sisters, is that ﬂesh and blood cannot
inherit the Kingdom of God. These1 CORINTHIANS 15
76
perishable bodies of ours are not able to
live forever.
51 But let me tell you a wonderful secret
God has revealed to us. Not all of us will
die, but we will all be transformed.
52 It will happen in a moment, in
the blinking of an eye, when the last
trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet
sounds, the Chris ans who have died
will be raised with transformed bodies.
And then we who are living will be
transformed so that we will never die.
53 For our perishable earthly bodies
must be transformed into heavenly
bodies that will never die.
54 When this happens––when our
perishable earthly bodies have been
transformed into heavenly bodies
that will never die––then at last the
Scriptures will come true: "Death is
swallowed up in victory.1 CORINTHIANS 15 – 16
77
55 O death, where is your victory? O
death, where is your s ng?"
56 For sin is the s ng that results in
death, and the law gives sin its power.
57 How we thank God, who gives us
victory over sin and death through Jesus
Christ our Lord!
58 So, my dear brothers and sisters, be
strong and steady, always enthusias c
about the Lord’s work, for you know
that nothing you do for the Lord is ever
useless.
1 Now about the money being
collected for the Chris ans in
Jerusalem: You should follow the same
procedures I gave to the churches in
Gala a.
2 On every Lord’s Day, each of you
should put aside some amount of money
in rela on to what you have earned and
save it for this oﬀering. Don’t wait un l I
161 CORINTHIANS 16
78
get there and then try to collect it all at
once.
3 When I come I will write le ers of
recommenda on for the messengers
you choose to deliver your gi to
Jerusalem.
4 And if it seems appropriate for me
also to go along, then we can travel
together.
5 I am coming to visit you a er I have
been to Macedonia, for I am planning to
travel through Macedonia.
6 It could be that I will stay awhile with
you, perhaps all winter, and then you
can send me on my way to the next
des na on.
7 This me I don’t want to make just a
short visit and then go right on. I want to
come and stay awhile, if the Lord will let
me.1 CORINTHIANS 16
8 In the mean
79
me, I will be staying
here at Ephesus un l the Fes val of
Pentecost,
9 for there is a wide–open door for a
great work here, and many people are
responding. But there are many who
oppose me.
10 When Timothy comes, treat him with
respect. He is doing the Lord’s work, just
as I am.
11 Don’t let anyone despise him. Send
him on his way with your blessings when
he returns to me. I am looking forward
to seeing him soon, along with the other
brothers.
12 Now about our brother Apollos––I
urged him to join the other brothers
when they visit you, but he was not
willing to come right now. He will be
seeing you later, when the me is right.
13 Be on guard. Stand true to what you
believe. Be courageous. Be strong.1 CORINTHIANS 16
80
14 And everything you do must be done
with love.
15 You know that Stephanas and his
household were the ﬁrst to become
Chris ans in Greece, and they are
spending their lives in service to other
Chris ans. I urge you, dear brothers and
sisters,
16 to respect them fully and others like
them who serve with such real devo on.
17 I am so glad that Stephanas,
Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come
here. They have been making up for the
help you weren’t here to give me.
18 They have been a wonderful
encouragement to me, as they have
been to you, too. You must give proper
honor to all who serve so well.
19 The churches here in the province
of Asia greet you hear ly in the Lord,
along with Aquila and Priscilla and all1 CORINTHIANS 16
81
the others who gather in their home for
church mee ngs.
20 All the brothers and sisters here have
asked me to greet you for them. Greet
each other in Chris an love.
21 Here is my gree ng, which I write
with my own hand––PAUL.
22 If anyone does not love the Lord, that
person is cursed. Our Lord, come!
23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be
with you.
24 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.2 Corinthians
1 This le
er is from Paul, appointed
by God to be an apostle of Christ
Jesus, and from our dear brother
Timothy. We are wri ng to God’s church
in Corinth and to all the Chris ans
throughout Greece.
2 May God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ give you his grace and peace.
3 All praise to the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the source of
every mercy and the God who comforts
us.
4 He comforts us in all our troubles
so that we can comfort others. When
others are troubled, we will be able to
give them the same comfort God has
given us.
12 CORINTHIANS 1
2
5 You can be sure that the more we
suﬀer for Christ, the more God will
shower us with his comfort through
Christ.
6 So when we are weighed down
with troubles, it is for your beneﬁt
and salva on! For when God comforts
us, it is so that we, in turn, can be an
encouragement to you. Then you can
pa ently endure the same things we
suﬀer.
7 We are conﬁdent that as you share
in suﬀering, you will also share God’s
comfort.
8 I think you ought to know, dear
brothers and sisters, about the trouble
we went through in the province of
Asia. We were crushed and completely
overwhelmed, and we thought we would
never live through it.
9 In fact, we expected to die. But as
a result, we learned not to rely on2 CORINTHIANS 1
3
ourselves, but on God who can raise the
dead.
10 And he did deliver us from mortal
danger. And we are conﬁdent that he
will con nue to deliver us.
11 He will rescue us because you are
helping by praying for us. As a result,
many will give thanks to God because
so many people’s prayers for our safety
have been answered.
12 We can say with conﬁdence and a
clear conscience that we have been
honest and sincere in all our dealings.
We have depended on God’s grace, not
on our own earthly wisdom. That is how
we have acted toward everyone, and
especially toward you.
13 My le ers have been straigh orward,
and there is nothing wri en between the
lines and nothing you can’t understand. I
hope someday you will fully understand
us,2 CORINTHIANS 1
4
14 even if you don’t fully understand
us now. Then on the day when our
Lord Jesus comes back again, you will
be proud of us in the same way we are
proud of you.
15 Since I was so sure of your
understanding and trust, I wanted to
give you a double blessing.
16 I wanted to stop and see you on my
way to Macedonia and again on my
return trip. Then you could send me on
my way to Judea.
17 You may be asking why I changed my
plan. Hadn’t I made up my mind yet? Or
am I like people of the world who say
yes when they really mean no?
18 As surely as God is true, I am not that
sort of person. My yes means yes
19 because Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
never wavers between yes and no. He
is the one whom Timothy, Silas, and I2 CORINTHIANS 1
5
preached to you, and he is the divine
Yes––God’s aﬃrma on.
20 For all of God’s promises have been
fulﬁlled in him. That is why we say
"Amen" when we give glory to God
through Christ.
21 It is God who gives us, along with
you, the ability to stand ﬁrm for Christ.
He has commissioned us,
22 and he has iden ﬁed us as his own
by placing the Holy Spirit in our hearts as
the ﬁrst installment of everything he will
give us.
23 Now I call upon God as my witness
that I am telling the truth. The reason I
didn’t return to Corinth was to spare you
from a severe rebuke.
24 But that does not mean we want to
tell you exactly how to put your faith
into prac ce. We want to work together
with you so you will be full of joy as you
stand ﬁrm in your faith.2 CORINTHIANS 2
2
6
1 So I said to myself, "No, I won’t do
it. I won’t make them unhappy with
another painful visit."
2 For if I cause you pain and make you
sad, who is going to make me glad?
3 That is why I wrote as I did in my last
le er, so that when I do come, I will
not be made sad by the very ones who
ought to give me the greatest joy. Surely
you know that my happiness depends
on your happiness.
4 How painful it was to write that le er!
Heartbroken, I cried over it. I didn’t want
to hurt you, but I wanted you to know
how very much I love you.
5 I am not oversta ng it when I say that
the man who caused all the trouble hurt
your en re church more than he hurt
me.
6 He was punished enough when most
of you were united in your judgment
against him.2 CORINTHIANS 2
7 Now it is
7
me to forgive him and
comfort him. Otherwise he may become
so discouraged that he won’t be able to
recover.
8 Now show him that you s ll love him.
9 I wrote to you as I did to ﬁnd out how
far you would go in obeying me.
10 When you forgive this man, I forgive
him, too. And when I forgive him (for
whatever is to be forgiven), I do so with
Christ’s authority for your beneﬁt,
11 so that Satan will not outsmart us.
For we are very familiar with his evil
schemes.
12 Well, when I came to the city of Troas
to preach the Good News of Christ, the
Lord gave me tremendous opportuni es.
13 But I couldn’t rest because my dear
brother Titus hadn’t yet arrived with a
report from you. So I said good–bye and
went on to Macedonia to ﬁnd him.2 CORINTHIANS 2
8
14 But thanks be to God, who made us
his cap ves and leads us along in Christ’s
triumphal procession. Now wherever we
go he uses us to tell others about the
Lord and to spread the Good News like a
sweet perfume.
15 Our lives are a fragrance presented
by Christ to God. But this fragrance is
perceived diﬀerently by those being
saved and by those perishing.
16 To those who are perishing we are
a fearful smell of death and doom.
But to those who are being saved we
are a life–giving perfume. And who is
adequate for such a task as this?
17 You see, we are not like those
hucksters––and there are many of
them––who preach just to make money.
We preach God’s message with sincerity
and with Christ’s authority. And we know
that the God who sent us is watching us.2 CORINTHIANS 3

1 Are we beginning again to tell you
how good we are? Some people
need to bring le ers of recommenda on
with them or ask you to write le ers of
recommenda on for them.
2 But the only le er of recommenda on
we need is you yourselves! Your lives
are a le er wri en in our hearts, and
everyone can read it and recognize our
good work among you.
3 Clearly, you are a le er from Christ
prepared by us. It is wri en not with pen
and ink, but with the Spirit of the living
God. It is carved not on stone, but on
human hearts.
4 We are conﬁdent of all this because of
our great trust in God through Christ.
5 It is not that we think we can do
anything of las ng value by ourselves.
Our only power and success come from
God.2 CORINTHIANS 3
10
6 He is the one who has enabled us to
represent his new covenant. This is a
covenant, not of wri en laws, but of the
Spirit. The old way ends in death; in the
new way, the Holy Spirit gives life.
7 That old system of law etched in stone
led to death, yet it began with such glory
that the people of Israel could not bear
to look at Moses’ face. For his face shone
with the glory of God, even though the
brightness was already fading away.
8 Shouldn’t we expect far greater glory
when the Holy Spirit is giving life?
9 If the old covenant, which brings
condemna on, was glorious, how much
more glorious is the new covenant,
which makes us right with God!
10 In fact, that ﬁrst glory was not
glorious at all compared with the
overwhelming glory of the new
covenant.2 CORINTHIANS 3
11
11 So if the old covenant, which has
been set aside, was full of glory, then the
new covenant, which remains forever,
has far greater glory.
12 Since this new covenant gives us such
conﬁdence, we can be very bold.
13 We are not like Moses, who put a
veil over his face so the people of Israel
would not see the glory fading away.
14 But the people’s minds were
hardened, and even to this day
whenever the old covenant is being
read, a veil covers their minds so they
cannot understand the truth. And this
veil can be removed only by believing in
Christ.
15 Yes, even today when they read
Moses’ wri ngs, their hearts are
covered with that veil, and they do not
understand.
16 But whenever anyone turns to the
Lord, then the veil is taken away.2 CORINTHIANS 3 – 4
12
17 Now, the Lord is the Spirit, and
wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, he
gives freedom.
18 And all of us have had that veil
removed so that we can be mirrors that
brightly reﬂect the glory of the Lord. And
as the Spirit of the Lord works within us,
we become more and more like him and
reﬂect his glory even more.
1 And so, since God in his mercy has
given us this wonderful ministry, we
never give up.
2 We reject all shameful and
underhanded methods. We do not
try to trick anyone, and we do not distort
the word of God. We tell the truth before
God, and all who are honest know that.
3 If the Good News we preach is veiled
from anyone, it is a sign that they are
perishing.
4 Satan, the god of this evil world,
has blinded the minds of those who
42 CORINTHIANS 4
13
don’t believe, so they are unable to see
the glorious light of the Good News
that is shining upon them. They don’t
understand the message we preach
about the glory of Christ, who is the
exact likeness of God.
5 We don’t go around preaching about
ourselves; we preach Christ Jesus, the
Lord. All we say about ourselves is that
we are your servants because of what
Jesus has done for us.
6 For God, who said, "Let there be
light in the darkness," has made
us understand that this light is the
brightness of the glory of God that is
seen in the face of Jesus Christ.
7 But this precious treasure––this light
and power that now shine within us––is
held in perishable containers, that is, in
our weak bodies. So everyone can see
that our glorious power is from God and
is not our own.2 CORINTHIANS 4
14
8 We are pressed on every side by
troubles, but we are not crushed and
broken. We are perplexed, but we don’t
give up and quit.
9 We are hunted down, but God never
abandons us. We get knocked down, but
we get up again and keep going.
10 Through suﬀering, these bodies of
ours constantly share in the death of
Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also
be seen in our bodies.
11 Yes, we live under constant danger of
death because we serve Jesus, so that
the life of Jesus will be obvious in our
dying bodies.
12 So we live in the face of death, but it
has resulted in eternal life for you.
13 But we con nue to preach because
we have the same kind of faith the
psalmist had when he said, "I believed in
God, and so I speak."2 CORINTHIANS 4
15
14 We know that the same God who
raised our Lord Jesus will also raise us
with Jesus and present us to himself
along with you.
15 All of these things are for your
beneﬁt. And as God’s grace brings more
and more people to Christ, there will be
great thanksgiving, and God will receive
more and more glory.
16 That is why we never give up. Though
our bodies are dying, our spirits are
being renewed every day.
17 For our present troubles are quite
small and won’t last very long. Yet they
produce for us an immeasurably great
glory that will last forever!
18 So we don’t look at the troubles
we can see right now; rather, we look
forward to what we have not yet seen.
For the troubles we see will soon be over,
but the joys to come will last forever.2 CORINTHIANS 5
5
16
1 For we know that when this earthly
tent we live in is taken down––when
we die and leave these bodies––we will
have a home in heaven, an eternal body
made for us by God himself and not by
human hands.
2 We grow weary in our present bodies,
and we long for the day when we will
put on our heavenly bodies like new
clothing.
3 For we will not be spirits without
bodies, but we will put on new heavenly
bodies.
4 Our dying bodies make us groan and
sigh, but it’s not that we want to die
and have no bodies at all. We want to
slip into our new bodies so that these
dying bodies will be swallowed up by
everlas ng life.
5 God himself has prepared us for this,
and as a guarantee he has given us his
Holy Spirit.2 CORINTHIANS 5
17
6 So we are always conﬁdent, even
though we know that as long as we live
in these bodies we are not at home with
the Lord.
7 That is why we live by believing and
not by seeing.
8 Yes, we are fully conﬁdent, and we
would rather be away from these bodies,
for then we will be at home with the
Lord.
9 So our aim is to please him always,
whether we are here in this body or
away from this body.
10 For we must all stand before Christ
to be judged. We will each receive
whatever we deserve for the good or
evil we have done in our bodies.
11 It is because we know this solemn
fear of the Lord that we work so hard
to persuade others. God knows we are
sincere, and I hope you know this, too.2 CORINTHIANS 5
18
12 Are we trying to pat ourselves on
the back again? No, we are giving you
a reason to be proud of us, so you can
answer those who brag about having a
spectacular ministry rather than having
a sincere heart before God.
13 If it seems that we are crazy, it is to
bring glory to God. And if we are in our
right minds, it is for your beneﬁt.
14 Whatever we do, it is because Christ’s
love controls us. Since we believe that
Christ died for everyone, we also believe
that we have all died to the old life we
used to live.
15 He died for everyone so that those
who receive his new life will no longer
live to please themselves. Instead, they
will live to please Christ, who died and
was raised for them.
16 So we have stopped evalua ng
others by what the world thinks about
them. Once I mistakenly thought of2 CORINTHIANS 5
19
Christ that way, as though he were
merely a human being. How diﬀerently I
think about him now!
17 What this means is that those who
become Chris ans become new persons.
They are not the same anymore, for the
old life is gone. A new life has begun!
18 All this newness of life is from God,
who brought us back to himself through
what Christ did. And God has given us
the task of reconciling people to him.
19 For God was in Christ, reconciling
the world to himself, no longer coun ng
people’s sins against them. This is the
wonderful message he has given us to
tell others.
20 We are Christ’s ambassadors, and
God is using us to speak to you. We urge
you, as though Christ himself were here
pleading with you, "Be reconciled to
God!"2 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
20
21 For God made Christ, who never
sinned, to be the oﬀering for our sin, so
that we could be made right with God
through Christ.
1 As God’s partners, we beg you not
to reject this marvelous message of
God’s great kindness.
2 For God says, "At just the right me,
I heard you. On the day of salva on, I
helped you." Indeed, God is ready to
help you right now. Today is the day of
salva on.
3 We try to live in such a way that no
one will be hindered from ﬁnding the
Lord by the way we act, and so no one
can ﬁnd fault with our ministry.
4 In everything we do we try to show
that we are true ministers of God. We
pa ently endure troubles and hardships
and calami es of every kind.
5 We have been beaten, been put
in jail, faced angry mobs, worked to
62 CORINTHIANS 6
21
exhaus on, endured sleepless nights,
and gone without food.
6 We have proved ourselves by our
purity, our understanding, our pa ence,
our kindness, our sincere love, and the
power of the Holy Spirit.
7 We have faithfully preached the truth.
God’s power has been working in us. We
have righteousness as our weapon, both
to a ack and to defend ourselves.
8 We serve God whether people honor
us or despise us, whether they slander
us or praise us. We are honest, but they
call us impostors.
9 We are well known, but we are treated
as unknown. We live close to death, but
here we are, s ll alive. We have been
beaten within an inch of our lives.
10 Our hearts ache, but we always have
joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual
riches to others. We own nothing, and
yet we have everything.2 CORINTHIANS 6
22
11 Oh, dear Corinthian friends! We have
spoken honestly with you. Our hearts
are open to you.
12 If there is a problem between us, it is
not because of a lack of love on our part,
but because you have withheld your love
from us.
13 I am talking now as I would to my
own children. Open your hearts to us!
14 Don’t team up with those who are
unbelievers. How can goodness be a
partner with wickedness? How can light
live with darkness?
15 What harmony can there be between
Christ and the Devil? How can a believer
be a partner with an unbeliever?
16 And what union can there be
between God’s temple and idols? For we
are the temple of the living God. As God
said: "I will live in them and walk among
them. I will be their God, and they will
be my people.2 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
23
17 Therefore, come out from them and
separate yourselves from them, says the
Lord. Don’t touch their ﬁlthy things, and
I will welcome you.
18 And I will be your Father, and you will
be my sons and daughters, says the Lord
Almighty."
1 Because we have these promises,
dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves
from everything that can deﬁle our
body or spirit. And let us work toward
complete purity because we fear God.
2 Please open your hearts to us. We
have not done wrong to anyone. We
have not led anyone astray. We have not
taken advantage of anyone.
3 I’m not saying this to condemn you,
for I said before that you are in our
hearts forever. We live or die together
with you.
4 I have the highest conﬁdence in you,
and my pride in you is great. You have
72 CORINTHIANS 7
24
greatly encouraged me; you have made
me happy despite all our troubles.
5 When we arrived in Macedonia there
was no rest for us. Outside there was
conﬂict from every direc on, and inside
there was fear.
6 But God, who encourages those who
are discouraged, encouraged us by the
arrival of Titus.
7 His presence was a joy, but so was the
news he brought of the encouragement
he received from you. When he told me
how much you were looking forward to
my visit, and how sorry you were about
what had happened, and how loyal your
love is for me, I was ﬁlled with joy!
8 I am no longer sorry that I sent that
le er to you, though I was sorry for a
me, for I know that it was painful to
you for a li le while.
9 Now I am glad I sent it, not because it
hurt you, but because the pain caused2 CORINTHIANS 7
25
you to have remorse and change your
ways. It was the kind of sorrow God
wants his people to have, so you were
not harmed by us in any way.
10 For God can use sorrow in our lives
to help us turn away from sin and seek
salva on. We will never regret that
kind of sorrow. But sorrow without
repentance is the kind that results in
death.
11 Just see what this godly sorrow
produced in you! Such earnestness,
such concern to clear yourselves, such
indigna on, such alarm, such longing to
see me, such zeal, and such a readiness
to punish the wrongdoer. You showed
that you have done everything you could
to make things right.
12 My purpose was not to write about
who did the wrong or who was wronged.
I wrote to you so that in the sight of God2 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
26
you could show how much you really do
care for us.
13 We have been encouraged by this.
In addi on to our own encouragement,
we were especially delighted to see
how happy Titus was at the way you
welcomed him and set his mind at ease.
14 I had told him how proud I was of
you––and you didn’t disappoint me. I
have always told you the truth, and now
my boas ng to Titus has also proved
true!
15 Now he cares for you more than
ever when he remembers the way you
listened to him and welcomed him with
such respect and deep concern.
16 I am very happy now because I have
complete conﬁdence in you.
1 Now I want to tell you, dear
brothers and sisters, what God in his
kindness has done for the churches in
Macedonia.
82 CORINTHIANS 8
27
2 Though they have been going through
much trouble and hard mes, their
wonderful joy and deep poverty have
overﬂowed in rich generosity.
3 For I can tes fy that they gave not
only what they could aﬀord but far more.
And they did it of their own free will.
4 They begged us again and again for
the gracious privilege of sharing in the
gi for the Chris ans in Jerusalem.
5 Best of all, they went beyond our
highest hopes, for their ﬁrst ac on was
to dedicate themselves to the Lord and
to us for whatever direc ons God might
give them.
6 So we have urged Titus, who
encouraged your giving in the ﬁrst place,
to return to you and encourage you to
complete your share in this ministry of
giving.
7 Since you excel in so many ways––you
have so much faith, such gi ed speakers,2 CORINTHIANS 8
28
such knowledge, such enthusiasm, and
such love for us ––now I want you to
excel also in this gracious ministry of
giving.
8 I am not saying you must do it, even
though the other churches are eager to
do it. This is one way to prove your love
is real.
9 You know how full of love and
kindness our Lord Jesus Christ was.
Though he was very rich, yet for your
sakes he became poor, so that by his
poverty he could make you rich.
10 I suggest that you ﬁnish what you
started a year ago, for you were the ﬁrst
to propose this idea, and you were the
ﬁrst to begin doing something about it.
11 Now you should carry this project
through to comple on just as
enthusias cally as you began it. Give
whatever you can according to what you
have.2 CORINTHIANS 8
29
12 If you are really eager to give, it isn’t
important how much you are able to
give. God wants you to give what you
have, not what you don’t have.
13 Of course, I don’t mean you should
give so much that you suﬀer from having
too li le. I only mean that there should
be some equality.
14 Right now you have plenty and can
help them. Then at some other me
they can share with you when you need
it. In this way, everyone’s needs will be
met.
15 Do you remember what the
Scriptures say about this? "Those who
gathered a lot had nothing le over, and
those who gathered only a li le had
enough."
16 I am thankful to God that he has
given Titus the same enthusiasm for you
that I have.2 CORINTHIANS 8
30
17 He welcomed our request that he
visit you again. In fact, he himself was
eager to go and see you.
18 We are also sending another brother
with Titus. He is highly praised in all
the churches as a preacher of the Good
News.
19 He was appointed by the churches to
accompany us as we take the oﬀering to
Jerusalem ––a service that gloriﬁes the
Lord and shows our eagerness to help.
20 By traveling together we will guard
against any suspicion, for we are anxious
that no one should ﬁnd fault with the
way we are handling this generous gi .
21 We are careful to be honorable before
the Lord, but we also want everyone else
to know we are honorable.
22 And we are also sending with
them another brother who has been
thoroughly tested and has shown how
earnest he is on many occasions. He is2 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
31
now even more enthusias c because of
his increased conﬁdence in you.
23 If anyone asks about Titus, say that
he is my partner who works with me
to help you. And these brothers are
representa ves of the churches. They
are splendid examples of those who
bring glory to Christ.
24 So show them your love, and prove
to all the churches that our boas ng
about you is jus ﬁed.
1 I really don’t need to write to you
about this gi for the Chris ans in
Jerusalem.
2 For I know how eager you are to help,
and I have been boas ng to our friends
in Macedonia that you Chris ans in
Greece were ready to send an oﬀering a
year ago. In fact, it was your enthusiasm
that s rred up many of them to begin
helping.
92 CORINTHIANS 9
32
3 But I am sending these brothers just
to be sure that you really are ready, as
I told them you would be, with your
money all collected. I don’t want it to
turn out that I was wrong in my boas ng
about you.
4 I would be humiliated––and so would
you––if some Macedonian Chris ans
came with me, only to ﬁnd that you s ll
weren’t ready a er all I had told them!
5 So I thought I should send these
brothers ahead of me to make sure the
gi you promised is ready. But I want it
to be a willing gi , not one given under
pressure.
6 Remember this––a farmer who plants
only a few seeds will get a small crop.
But the one who plants generously will
get a generous crop.
7 You must each make up your own
mind as to how much you should give.
Don’t give reluctantly or in response to2 CORINTHIANS 9
33
pressure. For God loves the person who
gives cheerfully.
8 And God will generously provide all
you need. Then you will always have
everything you need and plenty le over
to share with others.
9 As the Scriptures say, "Godly people
give generously to the poor. Their good
deeds will never be forgo en."
10 For God is the one who gives seed
to the farmer and then bread to eat.
In the same way, he will give you many
opportuni es to do good, and he will
produce a great harvest of generosity in
you.
11 Yes, you will be enriched so that
you can give even more generously.
And when we take your gi s to those
who need them, they will break out in
thanksgiving to God.
12 So two good things will happen––the
needs of the Chris ans in Jerusalem will2 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
34
be met, and they will joyfully express
their thanksgiving to God.
13 You will be glorifying God through
your generous gi s. For your generosity
to them will prove that you are obedient
to the Good News of Christ.
14 And they will pray for you with deep
aﬀec on because of the wonderful grace
of God shown through you.
15 Thank God for his Son––a gi too
wonderful for words!
1 Now I, Paul, plead with you. I
plead with the gentleness and
kindness that Christ himself would use,
even though some of you say I am bold
in my le ers but mid in person.
2 I hope it won’t be necessary, but
when I come I may have to be very bold
with those who think we act from purely
human mo ves.
3 We are human, but we don’t wage
war with human plans and methods.
102 CORINTHIANS 10
35
4 We use God’s mighty weapons, not
mere worldly weapons, to knock down
the Devil’s strongholds.
5 With these weapons we break down
every proud argument that keeps people
from knowing God. With these weapons
we conquer their rebellious ideas, and
we teach them to obey Christ.
6 And we will punish those who
remained disobedient a er the rest of
you became loyal and obedient.
7 The trouble with you is that you
make your decisions on the basis of
appearance. You must recognize that we
belong to Christ just as much as those
who proudly declare that they belong to
Christ.
8 I may seem to be boas ng too much
about the authority given to us by the
Lord. But this authority is to build you
up, not to tear you down. And I will not2 CORINTHIANS 10
36
be put to shame by having my work
among you destroyed.
9 Now this is not just an a empt to
frighten you by my le ers.
10 For some say, "Don’t worry about
Paul. His le ers are demanding and
forceful, but in person he is weak, and
his speeches are really bad!"
11 The ones who say this must realize
that we will be just as demanding and
forceful in person as we are in our
le ers.
12 Oh, don’t worry; I wouldn’t dare
say that I am as wonderful as these
other men who tell you how important
they are! But they are only comparing
themselves with each other, and
measuring themselves by themselves.
What foolishness!
13 But we will not boast of authority we
do not have. Our goal is to stay within
the boundaries of God’s plan for us, and2 CORINTHIANS 10
37
this plan includes our working there with
you.
14 We are not going too far when we
claim authority over you, for we were
the ﬁrst to travel all the way to you with
the Good News of Christ.
15 Nor do we claim credit for the work
someone else has done. Instead, we
hope that your faith will grow and that
our work among you will be greatly
enlarged.
16 Then we will be able to go and preach
the Good News in other places that are
far beyond you, where no one else is
working. Then there will be no ques on
about being in someone else’s territory.
17 As the Scriptures say, "The person
who wishes to boast should boast only
of what the Lord has done."
18 When people boast about
themselves, it doesn’t count for2 CORINTHIANS 11
38
much. But when the Lord commends
someone, that’s diﬀerent!
1 I hope you will be pa ent with
me as I keep on talking like a fool.
Please bear with me.
2 I am jealous for you with the jealousy
of God himself. For I promised you as a
pure bride to one husband, Christ.
3 But I fear that somehow you will be
led away from your pure and simple
devo on to Christ, just as Eve was
deceived by the serpent.
4 You seem to believe whatever anyone
tells you, even if they preach about a
diﬀerent Jesus than the one we preach,
or a diﬀerent Spirit than the one you
received, or a diﬀerent kind of gospel
than the one you believed.
5 But I don’t think I am inferior to these
"super apostles."
6 I may not be a trained speaker, but I
know what I am talking about. I think
112 CORINTHIANS 11
39
you realize this by now, for we have
proved it again and again.
7 Did I do wrong when I humbled myself
and honored you by preaching God’s
Good News to you without expec ng
anything in return?
8 I "robbed" other churches by
accep ng their contribu ons so I could
serve you at no cost.
9 And when I was with you and didn’t
have enough to live on, I did not ask you
to help me. For the brothers who came
from Macedonia brought me another
gi . I have never yet asked you for any
support, and I never will.
10 As surely as the truth of Christ is in
me, I will never stop boas ng about this
all over Greece.
11 Why? Because I don’t love you? God
knows I do.
12 But I will con nue doing this to cut
the ground out from under the feet of2 CORINTHIANS 11
40
those who boast that their work is just
like ours.
13 These people are false apostles.
They have fooled you by disguising
themselves as apostles of Christ.
14 But I am not surprised! Even Satan
can disguise himself as an angel of light.
15 So it is no wonder his servants can
also do it by pretending to be godly
ministers. In the end they will get every
bit of punishment their wicked deeds
deserve.
16 Once again, don’t think that I have
lost my wits to talk like this. But even if
you do, listen to me, as you would to a
foolish person, while I also boast a li le.
17 Such bragging is not something the
Lord wants, but I am ac ng like a fool.
18 And since others boast about their
human achievements, I will, too.
19 A er all, you, who think you are so
wise, enjoy listening to fools!2 CORINTHIANS 11
41
20 You put up with it when they make
you their slaves, take everything you
have, take advantage of you, put on airs,
and slap you in the face.
21 I’m ashamed to say that we were not
strong enough to do that! But whatever
they dare to boast about––I’m talking
like a fool again––I can boast about it,
too.
22 They say they are Hebrews, do they?
So am I. And they say they are Israelites?
So am I. And they are descendants of
Abraham? So am I.
23 They say they serve Christ? I know
I sound like a madman, but I have
served him far more! I have worked
harder, been put in jail more o en, been
whipped mes without number, and
faced death again and again.
24 Five diﬀerent mes the Jews gave me
thirty–nine lashes.2 CORINTHIANS 11
25 Three
42
mes I was beaten with rods.
Once I was stoned. Three mes I was
shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night
and a day adri at sea.
26 I have traveled many weary miles. I
have faced danger from ﬂooded rivers
and from robbers. I have faced danger
from my own people, the Jews, as well
as from the Gen les. I have faced danger
in the ci es, in the deserts, and on the
stormy seas. And I have faced danger
from men who claim to be Chris ans but
are not.
27 I have lived with weariness and
pain and sleepless nights. O en I have
been hungry and thirsty and have gone
without food. O en I have shivered with
cold, without enough clothing to keep
me warm.
28 Then, besides all this, I have the daily
burden of how the churches are ge ng
along.2 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
43
29 Who is weak without my feeling that
weakness? Who is led astray, and I do
not burn with anger?
30 If I must boast, I would rather boast
about the things that show how weak I
am.
31 God, the Father of our Lord Jesus,
who is to be praised forever, knows I tell
the truth.
32 When I was in Damascus, the
governor under King Aretas kept guards
at the city gates to catch me.
33 But I was lowered in a basket through
a window in the city wall, and that’s how
I got away!
1 This boas ng is all so foolish, but
let me go on. Let me tell about
the visions and revela ons I received
from the Lord.
2 I was caught up into the third heaven
fourteen years ago.
122 CORINTHIANS 12
44
3 Whether my body was there or just
my spirit, I don’t know; only God knows.
4 But I do know that I was caught up into
paradise and heard things so astounding
that they cannot be told.
5 That experience is something worth
boas ng about, but I am not going to
do it. I am going to boast only about my
weaknesses.
6 I have plenty to boast about and
would be no fool in doing it, because I
would be telling the truth. But I won’t
do it. I don’t want anyone to think more
highly of me than what they can actually
see in my life and my message,
7 even though I have received
wonderful revela ons from God. But to
keep me from ge ng puﬀed up, I was
given a thorn in my ﬂesh, a messenger
from Satan to torment me and keep me
from ge ng proud.2 CORINTHIANS 12
8 Three diﬀerent
45
mes I begged the
Lord to take it away.
9 Each me he said, "My gracious favor
is all you need. My power works best in
your weakness." So now I am glad to
boast about my weaknesses, so that the
power of Christ may work through me.
10 Since I know it is all for Christ’s
good, I am quite content with my
weaknesses and with insults, hardships,
persecu ons, and calami es. For when I
am weak, then I am strong.
11 You have made me act like a
fool––boas ng like this. You ought to
be wri ng commenda ons for me, for
I am not at all inferior to these "super
apostles," even though I am nothing at
all.
12 When I was with you, I certainly
gave you every proof that I am truly an
apostle, sent to you by God himself. For2 CORINTHIANS 12
46
I pa ently did many signs and wonders
and miracles among you.
13 The only thing I didn’t do, which I do
in the other churches, was to become a
burden to you. Please forgive me for this
wrong!
14 Now I am coming to you for the third
me, and I will not be a burden to you.
I don’t want what you have; I want you.
And anyway, li le children don’t pay for
their parents’ food. It’s the other way
around; parents supply food for their
children.
15 I will gladly spend myself and all
I have for your spiritual good, even
though it seems that the more I love
you, the less you love me.
16 Some of you admit I was not a burden
to you. But they s ll think I was sneaky
and took advantage of you by trickery.
17 But how? Did any of the men I sent
to you take advantage of you?2 CORINTHIANS 12
47
18 When I urged Titus to visit you and
sent our other brother with him, did
Titus take advantage of you? No, of
course not! For we both have the same
Spirit and walk in each other’s steps,
doing things the same way.
19 Perhaps you think we are saying
all this just to defend ourselves. That
isn’t it at all. We tell you this as Christ’s
servants, and we know that God is
listening. Everything we do, dear friends,
is for your beneﬁt.
20 For I am afraid that when I come
to visit you I won’t like what I ﬁnd,
and then you won’t like my response.
I am afraid that I will ﬁnd quarreling,
jealousy, outbursts of anger, selﬁshness,
backstabbing, gossip, conceit, and
disorderly behavior.
21 Yes, I am afraid that when I come,
God will humble me again because of
you. And I will have to grieve because2 CORINTHIANS 13
48
many of you who sinned earlier have
not repented of your impurity, sexual
immorality, and eagerness for lus ul
pleasure.
1 This is the third me I am
coming to visit you. As the
Scriptures say, "The facts of every case
must be established by the tes mony of
two or three witnesses."
2 I have already warned those who had
been sinning when I was there on my
second visit. Now I again warn them and
all others, just as I did before, that this
next me I will not spare them.
3 I will give you all the proof you want
that Christ speaks through me. Christ is
not weak in his dealings with you; he is a
mighty power among you.
4 Although he died on the cross in
weakness, he now lives by the mighty
power of God. We, too, are weak, but we
132 CORINTHIANS 13
49
live in him and have God’s power––the
power we use in dealing with you.
5 Examine yourselves to see if your faith
is really genuine. Test yourselves. If you
cannot tell that Jesus Christ is among
you, it means you have failed the test.
6 I hope you recognize that we have
passed the test and are approved by
God.
7 We pray to God that you will not do
anything wrong. We pray this, not to
show that our ministry to you has been
successful, but because we want you to
do right even if we ourselves seem to
have failed.
8 Our responsibility is never to oppose
the truth, but to stand for the truth at all
mes.
9 We are glad to be weak, if you are
really strong. What we pray for is your
restora on to maturity.2 CORINTHIANS 13
10 I am wri
50
ng this to you before I
come, hoping that I won’t need to deal
harshly with you when I do come. For I
want to use the authority the Lord has
given me to build you up, not to tear you
down.
11 Dear brothers and sisters, I close my
le er with these last words: Rejoice.
Change your ways. Encourage each
other. Live in harmony and peace. Then
the God of love and peace will be with
you.
12 Greet each other in Chris an love.
13 (13:12A) All the Chris ans here send
you their gree ngs.
14 (13:13) May the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you
all.Gala ans
1 This le
er is from Paul, an apostle.
I was not appointed by any group
or by human authority. My call is from
Jesus Christ himself and from God the
Father, who raised Jesus from the dead.
2 All the brothers and sisters here join
me in sending gree ngs to the churches
of Gala a.
3 May grace and peace be yours from
God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
Christ.
4 He died for our sins, just as God our
Father planned, in order to rescue us
from this evil world in which we live.
5 That is why all glory belongs to God
through all the ages of eternity. Amen.
6 I am shocked that you are turning
away so soon from God, who in his
1GALATIANS 1
2
love and mercy called you to share the
eternal life he gives through Christ. You
are already following a diﬀerent way
7 that pretends to be the Good News
but is not the Good News at all. You are
being fooled by those who twist and
change the truth concerning Christ.
8 Let God’s curse fall on anyone,
including myself, who preaches any
other message than the one we told
you about. Even if an angel comes
from heaven and preaches any other
message, let him be forever cursed.
9 I will say it again: If anyone preaches
any other gospel than the one you
welcomed, let God’s curse fall upon that
person.
10 Obviously, I’m not trying to be a
people pleaser! No, I am trying to please
God. If I were s ll trying to please
people, I would not be Christ’s servant.GALATIANS 1
3
11 Dear brothers and sisters, I solemnly
assure you that the Good News of
salva on which I preach is not based on
mere human reasoning or logic.
12 For my message came by a direct
revela on from Jesus Christ himself. No
one else taught me.
13 You know what I was like when I
followed the Jewish religion––how I
violently persecuted the Chris ans. I did
my best to get rid of them.
14 I was one of the most religious Jews
of my own age, and I tried as hard as
possible to follow all the old tradi ons of
my religion.
15 But then something happened! For it
pleased God in his kindness to choose
me and call me, even before I was born!
What undeserved mercy!
16 Then he revealed his Son to me so
that I could proclaim the Good News
about Jesus to the Gen les. When allGALATIANS 1
4
this happened to me, I did not rush out
to consult with anyone else;
17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to
consult with those who were apostles
before I was. No, I went away into
Arabia and later returned to the city of
Damascus.
18 It was not un l three years later that
I ﬁnally went to Jerusalem for a visit
with Peter and stayed there with him for
ﬁ een days.
19 And the only other apostle I met at
that me was James, our Lord’s brother.
20 You must believe what I am saying,
for I declare before God that I am not
lying.
21 Then a er this visit, I went north into
the provinces of Syria and Cilicia.
22 And s ll the Chris ans in the
churches in Judea didn’t know me
personally.GALATIANS 1 – 2
5
23 All they knew was that people were
saying, "The one who used to persecute
us now preaches the very faith he tried
to destroy!"
24 And they gave glory to God because
of me.
1 Then fourteen years later I went
back to Jerusalem again, this me
with Barnabas; and Titus came along,
too.
2 I went there because God revealed to
me that I should go. While I was there I
talked privately with the leaders of the
church. I wanted them to understand
what I had been preaching to the
Gen les. I wanted to make sure they did
not disagree, or my ministry would have
been useless.
3 And they did agree. They did not even
demand that my companion Titus be
circumcised, though he was a Gen le.
2GALATIANS 2
4 Even that ques
6
on wouldn’t have
come up except for some so–called
Chris ans there––false ones, really
––who came to spy on us and see our
freedom in Christ Jesus. They wanted
to force us, like slaves, to follow their
Jewish regula ons.
5 But we refused to listen to them for a
single moment. We wanted to preserve
the truth of the Good News for you.
6 And the leaders of the church who
were there had nothing to add to
what I was preaching. (By the way,
their reputa on as great leaders made
no diﬀerence to me, for God has no
favorites.)
7 They saw that God had given me
the responsibility of preaching the
Good News to the Gen les, just as he
had given Peter the responsibility of
preaching to the Jews.GALATIANS 2
7
8 For the same God who worked
through Peter for the beneﬁt of the Jews
worked through me for the beneﬁt of
the Gen les.
9 In fact, James, Peter, and John, who
were known as pillars of the church,
recognized the gi God had given me,
and they accepted Barnabas and me as
their co–workers. They encouraged us
to keep preaching to the Gen les, while
they con nued their work with the Jews.
10 The only thing they suggested was
that we remember to help the poor, and
I have certainly been eager to do that.
11 But when Peter came to An och, I
had to oppose him publicly, speaking
strongly against what he was doing, for
it was very wrong.
12 When he ﬁrst arrived, he ate with
the Gen le Chris ans, who don’t bother
with circumcision. But a erward, when
some Jewish friends of James came,GALATIANS 2
8
Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gen les
anymore because he was afraid of what
these legalists would say.
13 Then the other Jewish Chris ans
followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even
Barnabas was inﬂuenced to join them in
their hypocrisy.
14 When I saw that they were not
following the truth of the Good News,
I said to Peter in front of all the
others, "Since you, a Jew by birth, have
discarded the Jewish laws and are living
like a Gen le, why are you trying to
make these Gen les obey the Jewish
laws you abandoned?
15 You and I are Jews by birth, not
‘sinners’ like the Gen les.
16 And yet we Jewish Chris ans know
that we become right with God, not
by doing what the law commands, but
by faith in Jesus Christ. So we have
believed in Christ Jesus, that we mightGALATIANS 2
9
be accepted by God because of our faith
in Christ––and not because we have
obeyed the law. For no one will ever be
saved by obeying the law."
17 But what if we seek to be made right
with God through faith in Christ and
then ﬁnd out that we are s ll sinners?
Has Christ led us into sin? Of course not!
18 Rather, I make myself guilty if I
rebuild the old system I already tore
down.
19 For when I tried to keep the law,
I realized I could never earn God’s
approval. So I died to the law so that I
might live for God. I have been cruciﬁed
with Christ.
20 I myself no longer live, but Christ
lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly
body by trus ng in the Son of God, who
loved me and gave himself for me.
21 I am not one of those who treats the
grace of God as meaningless. For if weGALATIANS 3
10
could be saved by keeping the law, then
there was no need for Christ to die.
1 Oh, foolish Gala ans! What
magician has cast an evil spell on
you? For you used to see the meaning of
Jesus Christ’s death as clearly as though
I had shown you a signboard with a
picture of Christ dying on the cross.
2 Let me ask you this one ques on: Did
you receive the Holy Spirit by keeping
the law? Of course not, for the Holy
Spirit came upon you only a er you
believed the message you heard about
Christ.
3 Have you lost your senses? A er
star ng your Chris an lives in the Spirit,
why are you now trying to become
perfect by your own human eﬀort?
4 You have suﬀered so much for the
Good News. Surely it was not in vain,
was it? Are you now going to just throw
it all away?
3GALATIANS 3
11
5 I ask you again, does God give you the
Holy Spirit and work miracles among you
because you obey the law of Moses? Of
course not! It is because you believe the
message you heard about Christ.
6 In the same way, "Abraham believed
God, so God declared him righteous
because of his faith."
7 The real children of Abraham, then,
are all those who put their faith in God.
8 What’s more, the Scriptures looked
forward to this me when God would
accept the Gen les, too, on the basis of
their faith. God promised this good news
to Abraham long ago when he said, "All
na ons will be blessed through you."
9 And so it is: All who put their faith in
Christ share the same blessing Abraham
received because of his faith.
10 But those who depend on the law
to make them right with God are under
his curse, for the Scriptures say, "CursedGALATIANS 3
12
is everyone who does not observe
and obey all these commands that are
wri en in God’s Book of the Law."
11 Consequently, it is clear that no one
can ever be right with God by trying to
keep the law. For the Scriptures say, "It
is through faith that a righteous person
has life."
12 How diﬀerent from this way of faith
is the way of law, which says, "If you wish
to ﬁnd life by obeying the law, you must
obey all of its commands."
13 But Christ has rescued us from the
curse pronounced by the law. When he
was hung on the cross, he took upon
himself the curse for our wrongdoing.
For it is wri en in the Scriptures, "Cursed
is everyone who is hung on a tree."
14 Through the work of Christ Jesus,
God has blessed the Gen les with the
same blessing he promised to Abraham,GALATIANS 3
13
and we Chris ans receive the promised
Holy Spirit through faith.
15 Dear brothers and sisters, here’s
an example from everyday life. Just
as no one can set aside or amend an
irrevocable agreement, so it is in this
case.
16 God gave the promise to Abraham
and his child. And no ce that it doesn’t
say the promise was to his children, as
if it meant many descendants. But the
promise was to his child––and that, of
course, means Christ.
17 This is what I am trying to say: The
agreement God made with Abraham
could not be canceled 430 years later
when God gave the law to Moses. God
would be breaking his promise.
18 For if the inheritance could be
received only by keeping the law, then
it would not be the result of accep ngGALATIANS 3
14
God’s promise. But God gave it to
Abraham as a promise.
19 Well then, why was the law given?
It was given to show people how guilty
they are. But this system of law was to
last only un l the coming of the child to
whom God’s promise was made. And
there is this further diﬀerence. God gave
his laws to angels to give to Moses, who
was the mediator between God and the
people.
20 Now a mediator is needed if two
people enter into an agreement, but
God acted on his own when he made his
promise to Abraham.
21 Well then, is there a conﬂict
between God’s law and God’s promises?
Absolutely not! If the law could have
given us new life, we could have been
made right with God by obeying it.
22 But the Scriptures have declared
that we are all prisoners of sin, so theGALATIANS 3
15
only way to receive God’s promise is to
believe in Jesus Christ.
23 Un l faith in Christ was shown to
us as the way of becoming right with
God, we were guarded by the law. We
were kept in protec ve custody, so to
speak, un l we could put our faith in the
coming Savior.
24 Let me put it another way. The law
was our guardian and teacher to lead us
un l Christ came. So now, through faith
in Christ, we are made right with God.
25 But now that faith in Christ has
come, we no longer need the law as our
guardian.
26 So you are all children of God through
faith in Christ Jesus.
27 And all who have been united with
Christ in bap sm have been made like
him.
28 There is no longer Jew or Gen le,
slave or free, male or female. For youGALATIANS 3 – 4
16
are all Chris ans––you are one in Christ
Jesus.
29 And now that you belong to Christ,
you are the true children of Abraham.
You are his heirs, and now all the
promises God gave to him belong to you.
1 Think of it this way. If a father
dies and leaves great wealth for his
young children, those children are not
much be er oﬀ than slaves un l they
grow up, even though they actually own
everything their father had.
2 They have to obey their guardians
un l they reach whatever age their
father set.
3 And that’s the way it was with us
before Christ came. We were slaves to
the spiritual powers of this world.
4 But when the right me came, God
sent his Son, born of a woman, subject
to the law.
4GALATIANS 4
17
5 God sent him to buy freedom for us
who were slaves to the law, so that he
could adopt us as his very own children.
6 And because you Gen les have
become his children, God has sent the
Spirit of his Son into your hearts, and
now you can call God your dear Father.
7 Now you are no longer a slave but
God’s own child. And since you are his
child, everything he has belongs to you.
8 Before you Gen les knew God, you
were slaves to so–called gods that do
not even exist.
9 And now that you have found God (or
should I say, now that God has found
you), why do you want to go back again
and become slaves once more to the
weak and useless spiritual powers of this
world?
10 You are trying to ﬁnd favor with God
by what you do or don’t do on certain
days or months or seasons or years.GALATIANS 4
18
11 I fear for you. I am afraid that all my
hard work for you was worth nothing.
12 Dear brothers and sisters, I plead
with you to live as I do in freedom from
these things, for I have become like
you Gen les were––free from the law.
You did not mistreat me when I ﬁrst
preached to you.
13 Surely you remember that I was sick
when I ﬁrst brought you the Good News
of Christ.
14 But even though my sickness was
revol ng to you, you did not reject me
and turn me away. No, you took me in
and cared for me as though I were an
angel from God or even Christ Jesus
himself.
15 Where is that joyful spirit we felt
together then? In those days, I know you
would gladly have taken out your own
eyes and given them to me if it had been
possible.GALATIANS 4
19
16 Have I now become your enemy
because I am telling you the truth?
17 Those false teachers who are so
anxious to win your favor are not doing
it for your good. They are trying to shut
you oﬀ from me so that you will pay
more a en on to them.
18 Now it’s wonderful if you are eager
to do good, and especially when I am
not with you.
19 But oh, my dear children! I feel as if
I am going through labor pains for you
again, and they will con nue un l Christ
is fully developed in your lives.
20 How I wish I were there with you
right now, so that I could be more gentle
with you. But at this distance I frankly
don’t know what else to do.
21 Listen to me, you who want to live
under the law. Do you know what the
law really says?GALATIANS 4
20
22 The Scriptures say that Abraham had
two sons, one from his slave–wife and
one from his freeborn wife.
23 The son of the slave–wife was born
in a human a empt to bring about the
fulﬁllment of God’s promise. But the son
of the freeborn wife was born as God’s
own fulﬁllment of his promise.
24 Now these two women serve as
an illustra on of God’s two covenants.
Hagar, the slave–wife, represents
Mount Sinai where people ﬁrst became
enslaved to the law.
25 And now Jerusalem is just like Mount
Sinai in Arabia, because she and her
children live in slavery.
26 But Sarah, the free woman,
represents the heavenly Jerusalem. And
she is our mother.
27 That is what Isaiah meant when
he prophesied, "Rejoice, O childless
woman! Break forth into loud and joyfulGALATIANS 4
21
song, even though you never gave birth
to a child. For the woman who could
bear no children now has more than all
the other women!"
28 And you, dear brothers and sisters,
are children of the promise, just like
Isaac.
29 And we who are born of the Holy
Spirit are persecuted by those who want
us to keep the law, just as Isaac, the child
of promise, was persecuted by Ishmael,
the son of the slave–wife.
30 But what do the Scriptures say about
that? "Get rid of the slave and her son,
for the son of the slave woman will not
share the family inheritance with the
free woman’s son."
31 So, dear brothers and sisters, we
are not children of the slave woman,
obligated to the law. We are children
of the free woman, acceptable to God
because of our faith.GALATIANS 5
5
22
1 So Christ has really set us free. Now
make sure that you stay free, and
don’t get ed up again in slavery to the
law.
2 Listen! I, Paul, tell you this: If you are
coun ng on circumcision to make you
right with God, then Christ cannot help
you.
3 I’ll say it again. If you are trying to ﬁnd
favor with God by being circumcised,
you must obey all of the regula ons in
the whole law of Moses.
4 For if you are trying to make
yourselves right with God by keeping the
law, you have been cut oﬀ from Christ!
You have fallen away from God’s grace.
5 But we who live by the Spirit eagerly
wait to receive everything promised to
us who are right with God through faith.
6 For when we place our faith in Christ
Jesus, it makes no diﬀerence to God
whether we are circumcised or notGALATIANS 5
23
circumcised. What is important is faith
expressing itself in love.
7 You were ge ng along so well. Who
has interfered with you to hold you back
from following the truth?
8 It certainly isn’t God, for he is the one
who called you to freedom.
9 But it takes only one wrong person
among you to infect all the others––a
li le yeast spreads quickly through the
whole batch of dough!
10 I am trus ng the Lord to bring you
back to believing as I do about these
things. God will judge that person,
whoever it is, who has been troubling
and confusing you.
11 Dear brothers and sisters, if I
were s ll preaching that you must be
circumcised––as some say I do––why
would the Jews persecute me? The
fact that I am s ll being persecutedGALATIANS 5
24
proves that I am s ll preaching salva on
through the cross of Christ alone.
12 I only wish that those troublemakers
who want to mu late you by
circumcision would mu late themselves.
13 For you have been called to live in
freedom––not freedom to sa sfy your
sinful nature, but freedom to serve one
another in love.
14 For the whole law can be summed
up in this one command: "Love your
neighbor as yourself."
15 But if instead of showing love among
yourselves you are always bi ng and
devouring one another, watch out!
Beware of destroying one another.
16 So I advise you to live according to
your new life in the Holy Spirit. Then you
won’t be doing what your sinful nature
craves.
17 The old sinful nature loves to do evil,
which is just opposite from what theGALATIANS 5
25
Holy Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us
desires that are opposite from what the
sinful nature desires. These two forces
are constantly ﬁgh ng each other, and
your choices are never free from this
conﬂict.
18 But when you are directed by the
Holy Spirit, you are no longer subject to
the law.
19 When you follow the desires of your
sinful nature, your lives will produce
these evil results: sexual immorality,
impure thoughts, eagerness for lus ul
pleasure,
20 idolatry, par cipa on in demonic
ac vi es, hos lity, quarreling, jealousy,
outbursts of anger, selﬁsh ambi on,
divisions, the feeling that everyone is
wrong except those in your own li le
group,
21 envy, drunkenness, wild par es, and
other kinds of sin. Let me tell you again,GALATIANS 5 – 6
26
as I have before, that anyone living that
sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom
of God.
22 But when the Holy Spirit controls our
lives, he will produce this kind of fruit in
us: love, joy, peace, pa ence, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness,
23 gentleness, and self–control. Here
there is no conﬂict with the law.
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus
have nailed the passions and desires
of their sinful nature to his cross and
cruciﬁed them there.
25 If we are living now by the Holy Spirit,
let us follow the Holy Spirit’s leading in
every part of our lives.
26 Let us not become conceited, or
irritate one another, or be jealous of one
another.
1 Dear brothers and sisters, if another
Chris an is overcome by some sin,
you who are godly should gently and
6GALATIANS 6
27
humbly help that person back onto the
right path. And be careful not to fall into
the same tempta on yourself.
2 Share each other’s troubles and
problems, and in this way obey the law
of Christ.
3 If you think you are too important
to help someone in need, you are only
fooling yourself. You are really a nobody.
4 Be sure to do what you should,
for then you will enjoy the personal
sa sfac on of having done your work
well, and you won’t need to compare
yourself to anyone else.
5 For we are each responsible for our
own conduct.
6 Those who are taught the word of
God should help their teachers by paying
them.
7 Don’t be misled. Remember that you
can’t ignore God and get away with it.
You will always reap what you sow!GALATIANS 6
8 Those who live only to sa
28
sfy their
own sinful desires will harvest the
consequences of decay and death. But
those who live to please the Spirit will
harvest everlas ng life from the Spirit.
9 So don’t get red of doing what is
good. Don’t get discouraged and give up,
for we will reap a harvest of blessing at
the appropriate me.
10 Whenever we have the opportunity,
we should do good to everyone,
especially to our Chris an brothers and
sisters.
11 No ce what large le ers I use as I
write these closing words in my own
handwri ng.
12 Those who are trying to force you
to be circumcised are doing it for just
one reason. They don’t want to be
persecuted for teaching that the cross of
Christ alone can save.GALATIANS 6
29
13 And even those who advocate
circumcision don’t really keep the
whole law. They only want you to be
circumcised so they can brag about it
and claim you as their disciples.
14 As for me, God forbid that I should
boast about anything except the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that
cross, my interest in this world died long
ago, and the world’s interest in me is
also long dead.
15 It doesn’t make any diﬀerence now
whether we have been circumcised
or not. What counts is whether we
really have been changed into new and
diﬀerent people.
16 May God’s mercy and peace be upon
all those who live by this principle. They
are the new people of God.
17 From now on, don’t let anyone
trouble me with these things. For I bearGALATIANS 6
30
on my body the scars that show I belong
to Jesus.
18 My dear brothers and sisters, may
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.Ephesians
1 This le
er is from Paul, chosen
by God to be an apostle of Christ
Jesus. It is wri en to God’s holy people
in Ephesus, who are faithful followers of
Christ Jesus.
2 May grace and peace be yours, sent
to you from God our Father and Jesus
Christ our Lord.
3 How we praise God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
us with every spiritual blessing in the
heavenly realms because we belong to
Christ.
4 Long ago, even before he made the
world, God loved us and chose us in
Christ to be holy and without fault in his

5 His unchanging plan has always been
to adopt us into his own family by
bringing us to himself through Jesus
Christ. And this gave him great pleasure.
6 So we praise God for the wonderful
kindness he has poured out on us
because we belong to his dearly loved
Son.
7 He is so rich in kindness that he
purchased our freedom through the
blood of his Son, and our sins are
forgiven.
8 He has showered his kindness
on us, along with all wisdom and
understanding.
9 God’s secret plan has now been
revealed to us; it is a plan centered on
Christ, designed long ago according to
his good pleasure.
10 And this is his plan: At the right me
he will bring everything together underEPHESIANS 1
3
the authority of Christ––everything in
heaven and on earth.
11 Furthermore, because of Christ, we
have received an inheritance from God,
for he chose us from the beginning, and
all things happen just as he decided long
ago.
12 God’s purpose was that we who were
the ﬁrst to trust in Christ should praise
our glorious God.
13 And now you also have heard the
truth, the Good News that God saves
you. And when you believed in Christ, he
iden ﬁed you as his own by giving you
the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long
ago.
14 The Spirit is God’s guarantee that he
will give us everything he promised and
that he has purchased us to be his own
people. This is just one more reason for
us to praise our glorious God.EPHESIANS 1
4
15 Ever since I ﬁrst heard of your strong
faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for
Chris ans everywhere,
16 I have never stopped thanking God
for you. I pray for you constantly,
17 asking God, the glorious Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual
wisdom and understanding, so that you
might grow in your knowledge of God.
18 I pray that your hearts will be ﬂooded
with light so that you can understand
the wonderful future he has promised
to those he called. I want you to realize
what a rich and glorious inheritance he
has given to his people.
19 I pray that you will begin to
understand the incredible greatness of
his power for us who believe him. This is
the same mighty power
20 that raised Christ from the dead and
seated him in the place of honor at God’s
right hand in the heavenly realms.EPHESIANS 1 – 2
5
21 Now he is far above any ruler or
authority or power or leader or anything
else in this world or in the world to
come.
22 And God has put all things under the
authority of Christ, and he gave him this
authority for the beneﬁt of the church.
23 And the church is his body; it is
ﬁlled by Christ, who ﬁlls everything
everywhere with his presence.
1 Once you were dead, doomed
forever because of your many sins.
2 You used to live just like the rest of
the world, full of sin, obeying Satan, the
mighty prince of the power of the air.
He is the spirit at work in the hearts of
those who refuse to obey God.
3 All of us used to live that way,
following the passions and desires of our
evil nature. We were born with an evil
nature, and we were under God’s anger
just like everyone else.
2EPHESIANS 2
6
4 But God is so rich in mercy, and he
loved us so very much,
5 that even while we were dead
because of our sins, he gave us life when
he raised Christ from the dead. (It is
only by God’s special favor that you have
been saved!)
6 For he raised us from the dead along
with Christ, and we are seated with him
in the heavenly realms––all because we
are one with Christ Jesus.
7 And so God can always point to us as
examples of the incredible wealth of his
favor and kindness toward us, as shown
in all he has done for us through Christ
Jesus.
8 God saved you by his special favor
when you believed. And you can’t take
credit for this; it is a gi from God.
9 Salva on is not a reward for the good
things we have done, so none of us can
boast about it.EPHESIANS 2
7
10 For we are God’s masterpiece. He has
created us anew in Christ Jesus, so that
we can do the good things he planned
for us long ago.
11 Don’t forget that you Gen les used
to be outsiders by birth. You were called
"the uncircumcised ones" by the Jews,
who were proud of their circumcision,
even though it aﬀected only their bodies
and not their hearts.
12 In those days you were living apart
from Christ. You were excluded from
God’s people, Israel, and you did not
know the promises God had made to
them. You lived in this world without
God and without hope.
13 But now you belong to Christ Jesus.
Though you once were far away from
God, now you have been brought near
to him because of the blood of Christ.
14 For Christ himself has made peace
between us Jews and you Gen les byEPHESIANS 2
8
making us all one people. He has broken
down the wall of hos lity that used to
separate us.
15 By his death he ended the whole
system of Jewish law that excluded the
Gen les. His purpose was to make peace
between Jews and Gen les by crea ng
in himself one new person from the two
groups.
16 Together as one body, Christ
reconciled both groups to God by means
of his death, and our hos lity toward
each other was put to death.
17 He has brought this Good News of
peace to you Gen les who were far away
from him, and to us Jews who were near.
18 Now all of us, both Jews and Gen les,
may come to the Father through the
same Holy Spirit because of what Christ
has done for us.
19 So now you Gen les are no longer
strangers and foreigners. You are ci zensEPHESIANS 2 – 3
9
along with all of God’s holy people. You
are members of God’s family.
20 We are his house, built on the
founda on of the apostles and the
prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ
Jesus himself.
21 We who believe are carefully joined
together, becoming a holy temple for
the Lord.
22 Through him you Gen les are also
joined together as part of this dwelling
where God lives by his Spirit.
1 I, Paul, am a prisoner of Christ Jesus
because of my preaching to you
Gen les.
2 As you already know, God has given
me this special ministry of announcing
his favor to you Gen les.
3 As I brieﬂy men oned earlier in this
le er, God himself revealed his secret
plan to me.
3EPHESIANS 3
4 As you read what I have wri
10
en, you
will understand what I know about this
plan regarding Christ.
5 God did not reveal it to previous
genera ons, but now he has revealed
it by the Holy Spirit to his holy apostles
and prophets.
6 And this is the secret plan: The
Gen les have an equal share with the
Jews in all the riches inherited by God’s
children. Both groups have believed
the Good News, and both are part of
the same body and enjoy together the
promise of blessings through Christ
Jesus.
7 By God’s special favor and mighty
power, I have been given the wonderful
privilege of serving him by spreading this
Good News.
8 Just think! Though I did nothing to
deserve it, and though I am the least
deserving Chris an there is, I was chosenEPHESIANS 3
11
for this special joy of telling the Gen les
about the endless treasures available to
them in Christ.
9 I was chosen to explain to everyone
this plan that God, the Creator of
all things, had kept secret from the
beginning.
10 God’s purpose was to show his
wisdom in all its rich variety to all the
rulers and authori es in the heavenly
realms. They will see this when Jews
and Gen les are joined together in his
church.
11 This was his plan from all eternity,
and it has now been carried out through
Christ Jesus our Lord.
12 Because of Christ and our faith in
him, we can now come fearlessly into
God’s presence, assured of his glad
welcome.
13 So please don’t despair because of
what they are doing to me here. It is forEPHESIANS 3
12
you that I am suﬀering, so you should
feel honored and encouraged.
14 When I think of the wisdom and
scope of God’s plan, I fall to my knees
and pray to the Father,
15 the Creator of everything in heaven
and on earth.
16 I pray that from his glorious,
unlimited resources he will give you
mighty inner strength through his Holy
Spirit.
17 And I pray that Christ will be more
and more at home in your hearts as you
trust in him. May your roots go down
deep into the soil of God’s marvelous
love.
18 And may you have the power to
understand, as all God’s people should,
how wide, how long, how high, and how
deep his love really is.
19 May you experience the love of
Christ, though it is so great you will neverEPHESIANS 3 – 4
13
fully understand it. Then you will be
ﬁlled with the fullness of life and power
that comes from God.
20 Now glory be to God! By his mighty
power at work within us, he is able
to accomplish inﬁnitely more than we
would ever dare to ask or hope.
21 May he be given glory in the church
and in Christ Jesus forever and ever
through endless ages. Amen.
1 Therefore I, a prisoner for serving
the Lord, beg you to lead a life
worthy of your calling, for you have been
called by God.
2 Be humble and gentle. Be pa ent with
each other, making allowance for each
other’s faults because of your love.
3 Always keep yourselves united in the
Holy Spirit, and bind yourselves together
with peace.
4EPHESIANS 4
14
4 We are all one body, we have the
same Spirit, and we have all been called
to the same glorious future.
5 There is only one Lord, one faith, one
bap sm,
6 and there is only one God and Father,
who is over us all and in us all and living
through us all.
7 However, he has given each one of us
a special gi according to the generosity
of Christ.
8 That is why the Scriptures say, "When
he ascended to the heights, he led a
crowd of cap ves and gave gi s to his
people."
9 No ce that it says "he ascended." This
means that Christ ﬁrst came down to the
lowly world in which we live.
10 The same one who came down is the
one who ascended higher than all the
heavens, so that his rule might ﬁll the
en re universe.EPHESIANS 4
11 He is the one who gave these gi
15
s to
the church: the apostles, the prophets,
the evangelists, and the pastors and
teachers.
12 Their responsibility is to equip God’s
people to do his work and build up the
church, the body of Christ,
13 un l we come to such unity in our
faith and knowledge of God’s Son that
we will be mature and full grown in the
Lord, measuring up to the full stature of
Christ.
14 Then we will no longer be like
children, forever changing our minds
about what we believe because
someone has told us something diﬀerent
or because someone has cleverly lied to
us and made the lie sound like the truth.
15 Instead, we will hold to the truth in
love, becoming more and more in every
way like Christ, who is the head of his
body, the church.EPHESIANS 4
16 Under his direc
16
on, the whole body
is ﬁ ed together perfectly. As each part
does its own special work, it helps the
other parts grow, so that the whole body
is healthy and growing and full of love.
17 With the Lord’s authority let me say
this: Live no longer as the ungodly do,
for they are hopelessly confused.
18 Their closed minds are full of
darkness; they are far away from the
life of God because they have shut their
minds and hardened their hearts against
him.
19 They don’t care anymore about
right and wrong, and they have given
themselves over to immoral ways. Their
lives are ﬁlled with all kinds of impurity
and greed.
20 But that isn’t what you were taught
when you learned about Christ.EPHESIANS 4
17
21 Since you have heard all about him
and have learned the truth that is in
Jesus,
22 throw oﬀ your old evil nature and
your former way of life, which is ro en
through and through, full of lust and
decep on.
23 Instead, there must be a spiritual
renewal of your thoughts and a tudes.
24 You must display a new nature
because you are a new person, created
in God’s likeness––righteous, holy, and
true.
25 So put away all falsehood and "tell
your neighbor the truth" because we
belong to each other.
26 And "don’t sin by le ng anger gain
control over you." Don’t let the sun go
down while you are s ll angry,
27 for anger gives a mighty foothold to
the Devil.EPHESIANS 4
18
28 If you are a thief, stop stealing. Begin
using your hands for honest work, and
then give generously to others in need.
29 Don’t use foul or abusive language.
Let everything you say be good and
helpful, so that your words will be an
encouragement to those who hear
them.
30 And do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy
Spirit by the way you live. Remember,
he is the one who has iden ﬁed you as
his own, guaranteeing that you will be
saved on the day of redemp on.
31 Get rid of all bi erness, rage, anger,
harsh words, and slander, as well as all
types of malicious behavior.
32 Instead, be kind to each other,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
just as God through Christ has forgiven
you.EPHESIANS 5
5
19
1 Follow God’s example in everything
you do, because you are his dear
children.
2 Live a life ﬁlled with love for others,
following the example of Christ, who
loved you and gave himself as a sacriﬁce
to take away your sins. And God was
pleased, because that sacriﬁce was like
sweet perfume to him.
3 Let there be no sexual immorality,
impurity, or greed among you. Such sins
have no place among God’s people.
4 Obscene stories, foolish talk, and
coarse jokes––these are not for you.
Instead, let there be thankfulness to
God.
5 You can be sure that no immoral,
impure, or greedy person will inherit
the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a
greedy person is really an idolater who
worships the things of this world.EPHESIANS 5
20
6 Don’t be fooled by those who try
to excuse these sins, for the terrible
anger of God comes upon all those who
disobey him.
7 Don’t par cipate in the things these
people do.
8 For though your hearts were once full
of darkness, now you are full of light
from the Lord, and your behavior should
show it!
9 For this light within you produces only
what is good and right and true.
10 Try to ﬁnd out what is pleasing to the
Lord.
11 Take no part in the worthless deeds
of evil and darkness; instead, rebuke and
expose them.
12 It is shameful even to talk about the
things that ungodly people do in secret.
13 But when the light shines on them, it
becomes clear how evil these things are.EPHESIANS 5
21
14 And where your light shines, it will
expose their evil deeds. This is why it is
said, "Awake, O sleeper, rise up from the
dead, and Christ will give you light."
15 So be careful how you live, not as
fools but as those who are wise.
16 Make the most of every opportunity
for doing good in these evil days.
17 Don’t act thoughtlessly, but try to
understand what the Lord wants you to
do.
18 Don’t be drunk with wine, because
that will ruin your life. Instead, let the
Holy Spirit ﬁll and control you.
19 Then you will sing psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs among yourselves,
making music to the Lord in your hearts.
20 And you will always give thanks for
everything to God the Father in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21 And further, you will submit to one
another out of reverence for Christ.EPHESIANS 5
22
22 You wives will submit to your
husbands as you do to the Lord.
23 For a husband is the head of his wife
as Christ is the head of his body, the
church; he gave his life to be her Savior.
24 As the church submits to Christ, so
you wives must submit to your husbands
in everything.
25 And you husbands must love your
wives with the same love Christ showed
the church. He gave up his life for her
26 to make her holy and clean, washed
by bap sm and God’s word.
27 He did this to present her to himself
as a glorious church without a spot or
wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead,
she will be holy and without fault.
28 In the same way, husbands ought
to love their wives as they love their
own bodies. For a man is actually loving
himself when he loves his wife.EPHESIANS 5 – 6
23
29 No one hates his own body but
lovingly cares for it, just as Christ cares
for his body, which is the church.
30 And we are his body.
31 As the Scriptures say, "A man leaves
his father and mother and is joined to his
wife, and the two are united into one."
32 This is a great mystery, but it is an
illustra on of the way Christ and the
church are one.
33 So again I say, each man must love
his wife as he loves himself, and the wife
must respect her husband.
1 Children, obey your parents
because you belong to the Lord, for
this is the right thing to do.
2 "Honor your father and mother." This
is the ﬁrst of the Ten Commandments
that ends with a promise.
3 And this is the promise: If you honor
your father and mother, "you will live a
long life, full of blessing."
6EPHESIANS 6
24
4 And now a word to you fathers. Don’t
make your children angry by the way you
treat them. Rather, bring them up with
the discipline and instruc on approved
by the Lord.
5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters
with deep respect and fear. Serve them
sincerely as you would serve Christ.
6 Work hard, but not just to please your
masters when they are watching. As
slaves of Christ, do the will of God with
all your heart.
7 Work with enthusiasm, as though you
were working for the Lord rather than
for people.
8 Remember that the Lord will reward
each one of us for the good we do,
whether we are slaves or free.
9 And in the same way, you masters
must treat your slaves right. Don’t
threaten them; remember, you bothEPHESIANS 6
25
have the same Master in heaven, and he
has no favorites.
10 A ﬁnal word: Be strong with the
Lord’s mighty power.
11 Put on all of God’s armor so that
you will be able to stand ﬁrm against all
strategies and tricks of the Devil.
12 For we are not ﬁgh ng against people
made of ﬂesh and blood, but against the
evil rulers and authori es of the unseen
world, against those mighty powers
of darkness who rule this world, and
against wicked spirits in the heavenly
realms.
13 Use every piece of God’s armor to
resist the enemy in the me of evil,
so that a er the ba le you will s ll be
standing ﬁrm.
14 Stand your ground, pu ng on the
sturdy belt of truth and the body armor
of God’s righteousness.EPHESIANS 6
26
15 For shoes, put on the peace that
comes from the Good News, so that you
will be fully prepared.
16 In every ba le you will need faith
as your shield to stop the ﬁery arrows
aimed at you by Satan.
17 Put on salva on as your helmet, and
take the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God.
18 Pray at all mes and on every
occasion in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Stay alert and be persistent in your
prayers for all Chris ans everywhere.
19 And pray for me, too. Ask God to give
me the right words as I boldly explain
God’s secret plan that the Good News is
for the Gen les, too.
20 I am in chains now for preaching this
message as God’s ambassador. But pray
that I will keep on speaking boldly for
him, as I should.EPHESIANS 6
27
21 Tychicus, a much loved brother and
faithful helper in the Lord’s work, will tell
you all about how I am ge ng along.
22 I am sending him to you for just this
purpose. He will let you know how we
are, and he will encourage you.
23 May God give you peace, dear
brothers and sisters, and love with faith,
from God the Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
24 May God’s grace be upon all who love
our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying
love.Philippians
1 This le
er is from Paul and Timothy,
slaves of Christ Jesus. It is wri en
to all of God’s people in Philippi, who
believe in Christ Jesus, and to the elders
and deacons.
2 May God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
3 Every me I think of you, I give thanks
to my God.
4 I always pray for you, and I make my
requests with a heart full of joy
5 because you have been my partners in
spreading the Good News about Christ
from the me you ﬁrst heard it un l
now.
6 And I am sure that God, who began
the good work within you, will con nue
1PHILIPPIANS 1
2
his work un l it is ﬁnally ﬁnished on that
day when Christ Jesus comes back again.
7 It is right that I should feel as I do
about all of you, for you have a very
special place in my heart. We have
shared together the blessings of God,
both when I was in prison and when I
was out, defending the truth and telling
others the Good News.
8 God knows how much I love you and
long for you with the tender compassion
of Christ Jesus.
9 I pray that your love for each other will
overﬂow more and more, and that you
will keep on growing in your knowledge
and understanding.
10 For I want you to understand what
really ma ers, so that you may live pure
and blameless lives un l Christ returns.
11 May you always be ﬁlled with the
fruit of your salva on ––those good
things that are produced in your life byPHILIPPIANS 1
3
Jesus Christ––for this will bring much
glory and praise to God.
12 And I want you to know, dear
brothers and sisters, that everything that
has happened to me here has helped to
spread the Good News.
13 For everyone here, including all the
soldiers in the palace guard, knows that
I am in chains because of Christ.
14 And because of my imprisonment,
many of the Chris ans here have gained
conﬁdence and become more bold in
telling others about Christ.
15 Some are preaching out of jealousy
and rivalry. But others preach about
Christ with pure mo ves.
16 They preach because they love me,
for they know the Lord brought me here
to defend the Good News.
17 Those others do not have pure
mo ves as they preach about Christ.
They preach with selﬁsh ambi on, notPHILIPPIANS 1
4
sincerely, intending to make my chains
more painful to me.
18 But whether or not their mo ves are
pure, the fact remains that the message
about Christ is being preached, so I
rejoice. And I will con nue to rejoice.
19 For I know that as you pray for me
and as the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps me,
this will all turn out for my deliverance.
20 For I live in eager expecta on and
hope that I will never do anything that
causes me shame, but that I will always
be bold for Christ, as I have been in the
past, and that my life will always honor
Christ, whether I live or I die.
21 For to me, living is for Christ, and
dying is even be er.
22 Yet if I live, that means frui ul service
for Christ. I really don’t know which is
be er.
23 I’m torn between two desires:
Some mes I want to live, and some mesPHILIPPIANS 1
5
I long to go and be with Christ. That
would be far be er for me,
24 but it is be er for you that I live.
25 I am convinced of this, so I will
con nue with you so that you will grow
and experience the joy of your faith.
26 Then when I return to you, you will
have even more reason to boast about
what Christ Jesus has done for me.
27 But whatever happens to me, you
must live in a manner worthy of the
Good News about Christ, as ci zens of
heaven. Then, whether I come and see
you again or only hear about you, I will
know that you are standing side by side,
ﬁgh ng together for the Good News.
28 Don’t be in midated by your
enemies. This will be a sign to them that
they are going to be destroyed, but that
you are going to be saved, even by God
himself.PHILIPPIANS 1 – 2
6
29 For you have been given not only the
privilege of trus ng in Christ but also the
privilege of suﬀering for him.
30 We are in this ﬁght together. You
have seen me suﬀer for him in the past,
and you know that I am s ll in the midst
of this great struggle.
1 Is there any encouragement from
belonging to Christ? Any comfort
from his love? Any fellowship together
in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and
sympathe c?
2 Then make me truly happy by agreeing
wholeheartedly with each other, loving
one another, and working together with
one heart and purpose.
3 Don’t be selﬁsh; don’t live to make a
good impression on others. Be humble,
thinking of others as be er than yourself.
4 Don’t think only about your own
aﬀairs, but be interested in others, too,
and what they are doing.
2PHILIPPIANS 2
5 Your a
7
tude should be the same that
Christ Jesus had.
6 Though he was God, he did not
demand and cling to his rights as God.
7 He made himself nothing; he took the
humble posi on of a slave and appeared
in human form.
8 And in human form he obediently
humbled himself even further by dying a
criminal’s death on a cross.
9 Because of this, God raised him up to
the heights of heaven and gave him a
name that is above every other name,
10 so that at the name of Jesus every
knee will bow, in heaven and on earth
and under the earth,
11 and every tongue will confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father.
12 Dearest friends, you were always so
careful to follow my instruc ons when I
was with you. And now that I am awayPHILIPPIANS 2
8
you must be even more careful to put
into ac on God’s saving work in your
lives, obeying God with deep reverence
and fear.
13 For God is working in you, giving you
the desire to obey him and the power to
do what pleases him.
14 In everything you do, stay away from
complaining and arguing,
15 so that no one can speak a word of
blame against you. You are to live clean,
innocent lives as children of God in a
dark world full of crooked and perverse
people. Let your lives shine brightly
before them.
16 Hold ghtly to the word of life, so
that when Christ returns, I will be proud
that I did not lose the race and that my
work was not useless.
17 But even if my life is to be poured
out like a drink oﬀering to complete the
sacriﬁce of your faithful service (that is,PHILIPPIANS 2
9
if I am to die for you), I will rejoice, and I
want to share my joy with all of you.
18 And you should be happy about this
and rejoice with me.
19 If the Lord Jesus is willing, I hope to
send Timothy to you soon. Then when
he comes back, he can cheer me up by
telling me how you are ge ng along.
20 I have no one else like Timothy, who
genuinely cares about your welfare.
21 All the others care only for
themselves and not for what ma ers to
Jesus Christ.
22 But you know how Timothy has
proved himself. Like a son with his father,
he has helped me in preaching the Good
News.
23 I hope to send him to you just as soon
as I ﬁnd out what is going to happen to
me here.
24 And I have conﬁdence from the Lord
that I myself will come to see you soon.PHILIPPIANS 2
10
25 Meanwhile, I thought I should send
Epaphroditus back to you. He is a
true brother, a faithful worker, and a
courageous soldier. And he was your
messenger to help me in my need.
26 Now I am sending him home again,
for he has been longing to see you, and
he was very distressed that you heard he
was ill.
27 And he surely was ill; in fact, he
almost died. But God had mercy on
him––and also on me, so that I would
not have such unbearable sorrow.
28 So I am all the more anxious to send
him back to you, for I know you will be
glad to see him, and that will lighten all
my cares.
29 Welcome him with Chris an love
and with great joy, and be sure to honor
people like him.
30 For he risked his life for the work of
Christ, and he was at the point of deathPHILIPPIANS 3
11
while trying to do for me the things you
couldn’t do because you were far away.
1 Whatever happens, dear brothers
and sisters, may the Lord give you
joy. I never get red of telling you this. I
am doing this for your own good.
2 Watch out for those dogs, those
wicked men and their evil deeds,
those mu lators who say you must be
circumcised to be saved.
3 For we who worship God in the
Spirit are the only ones who are truly
circumcised. We put no conﬁdence in
human eﬀort. Instead, we boast about
what Christ Jesus has done for us.
4 Yet I could have conﬁdence in myself
if anyone could. If others have reason for
conﬁdence in their own eﬀorts, I have
even more!
5 For I was circumcised when I was
eight days old, having been born into
a pure–blooded Jewish family that is a
3PHILIPPIANS 3
12
branch of the tribe of Benjamin. So I am
a real Jew if there ever was one! What’s
more, I was a member of the Pharisees,
who demand the strictest obedience to
the Jewish law.
6 And zealous? Yes, in fact, I harshly
persecuted the church. And I obeyed the
Jewish law so carefully that I was never
accused of any fault.
7 I once thought all these things were
so very important, but now I consider
them worthless because of what Christ
has done.
8 Yes, everything else is worthless when
compared with the priceless gain of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I have
discarded everything else, coun ng it all
as garbage, so that I may have Christ
9 and become one with him. I no longer
count on my own goodness or my ability
to obey God’s law, but I trust Christ toPHILIPPIANS 3
13
save me. For God’s way of making us
right with himself depends on faith.
10 As a result, I can really know Christ
and experience the mighty power that
raised him from the dead. I can learn
what it means to suﬀer with him, sharing
in his death,
11 so that, somehow, I can experience
the resurrec on from the dead!
12 I don’t mean to say that I have
already achieved these things or that I
have already reached perfec on! But I
keep working toward that day when I
will ﬁnally be all that Christ Jesus saved
me for and wants me to be.
13 No, dear brothers and sisters, I
am s ll not all I should be, but I am
focusing all my energies on this one
thing: Forge ng the past and looking
forward to what lies ahead,
14 I strain to reach the end of the race
and receive the prize for which God,PHILIPPIANS 3
14
through Christ Jesus, is calling us up to
heaven.
15 I hope all of you who are mature
Chris ans will agree on these things. If
you disagree on some point, I believe
God will make it plain to you.
16 But we must be sure to obey the
truth we have learned already.
17 Dear brothers and sisters, pa ern
your lives a er mine, and learn from
those who follow our example.
18 For I have told you o en before, and
I say it again with tears in my eyes, that
there are many whose conduct shows
they are really enemies of the cross of
Christ.
19 Their future is eternal destruc on.
Their god is their appe te, they brag
about shameful things, and all they think
about is this life here on earth.
20 But we are ci zens of heaven, where
the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we arePHILIPPIANS 3 – 4
15
eagerly wai ng for him to return as our
Savior.
21 He will take these weak mortal
bodies of ours and change them into
glorious bodies like his own, using the
same mighty power that he will use to
conquer everything, everywhere.
1 Dear brothers and sisters, I love
you and long to see you, for you are
my joy and the reward for my work. So
please stay true to the Lord, my dear
friends.
2 And now I want to plead with those
two women, Euodia and Syntyche.
Please, because you belong to the Lord,
se le your disagreement.
3 And I ask you, my true teammate, to
help these women, for they worked hard
with me in telling others the Good News.
And they worked with Clement and the
rest of my co–workers, whose names are
wri en in the Book of Life.
4PHILIPPIANS 4
16
4 Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say
it again––rejoice!
5 Let everyone see that you are
considerate in all you do. Remember, the
Lord is coming soon.
6 Don’t worry about anything; instead,
pray about everything. Tell God what
you need, and thank him for all he has
done.
7 If you do this, you will experience
God’s peace, which is far more wonderful
than the human mind can understand.
His peace will guard your hearts and
minds as you live in Christ Jesus.
8 And now, dear brothers and sisters,
let me say one more thing as I close
this le er. Fix your thoughts on what
is true and honorable and right. Think
about things that are pure and lovely
and admirable. Think about things that
are excellent and worthy of praise.PHILIPPIANS 4
9 Keep pu
17
ng into prac ce all you
learned from me and heard from me and
saw me doing, and the God of peace will
be with you.
10 How grateful I am, and how I praise
the Lord that you are concerned about
me again. I know you have always been
concerned for me, but for a while you
didn’t have the chance to help me.
11 Not that I was ever in need, for I
have learned how to get along happily
whether I have much or li le.
12 I know how to live on almost nothing
or with everything. I have learned
the secret of living in every situa on,
whether it is with a full stomach or
empty, with plenty or li le.
13 For I can do everything with the help
of Christ who gives me the strength I
need.
14 But even so, you have done well to
share with me in my present diﬃculty.PHILIPPIANS 4
18
15 As you know, you Philippians were
the only ones who gave me ﬁnancial
help when I brought you the Good News
and then traveled on from Macedonia.
No other church did this.
16 Even when I was in Thessalonica you
sent help more than once.
17 I don’t say this because I want a
gi from you. What I want is for you to
receive a well–earned reward because
of your kindness.
18 At the moment I have all I need–
–more than I need! I am generously
supplied with the gi s you sent me with
Epaphroditus. They are a sweet–smelling
sacriﬁce that is acceptable to God and
pleases him.
19 And this same God who takes care of
me will supply all your needs from his
glorious riches, which have been given
to us in Christ Jesus.PHILIPPIANS 4
19
20 Now glory be to God our Father
forever and ever. Amen.
21 Give my gree ngs to all the Chris ans
there. The brothers who are with me
here send you their gree ngs.
22 And all the other Chris ans send
their gree ngs, too, especially those
who work in Caesar’s palace.
23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit.Colossians
1 This le
er is from Paul, chosen by
God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus,
and from our brother Timothy.
2 It is wri en to God’s holy people in the
city of Colosse, who are faithful brothers
and sisters in Christ. May God our Father
give you grace and peace.
3 We always pray for you, and we give
thanks to God the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ,
4 for we have heard that you trust in
Christ Jesus and that you love all of God’s
people.
5 You do this because you are looking
forward to the joys of heaven––as you
have been ever since you ﬁrst heard the
truth of the Good News.
1COLOSSIANS 1
2
6 This same Good News that came to
you is going out all over the world. It
is changing lives everywhere, just as it
changed yours that very ﬁrst day you
heard and understood the truth about
God’s great kindness to sinners.
7 Epaphras, our much loved co–worker,
was the one who brought you the Good
News. He is Christ’s faithful servant, and
he is helping us in your place.
8 He is the one who told us about the
great love for others that the Holy Spirit
has given you.
9 So we have con nued praying for you
ever since we ﬁrst heard about you.
We ask God to give you a complete
understanding of what he wants to do in
your lives, and we ask him to make you
wise with spiritual wisdom.
10 Then the way you live will always
honor and please the Lord, and you
will con nually do good, kind things forCOLOSSIANS 1
3
others. All the while, you will learn to
know God be er and be er.
11 We also pray that you will be
strengthened with his glorious power so
that you will have all the pa ence and
endurance you need. May you be ﬁlled
with joy,
12 always thanking the Father, who has
enabled you to share the inheritance
that belongs to God’s holy people, who
live in the light.
13 For he has rescued us from the one
who rules in the kingdom of darkness,
and he has brought us into the Kingdom
of his dear Son.
14 God has purchased our freedom with
his blood and has forgiven all our sins.
15 Christ is the visible image of the
invisible God. He existed before God
made anything at all and is supreme
over all crea on.COLOSSIANS 1
4
16 Christ is the one through whom God
created everything in heaven and earth.
He made the things we can see and the
things we can’t see––kings, kingdoms,
rulers, and authori es. Everything has
been created through him and for him.
17 He existed before everything else
began, and he holds all crea on together.
18 Christ is the head of the church,
which is his body. He is the ﬁrst of all
who will rise from the dead, so he is ﬁrst
in everything.
19 For God in all his fullness was pleased
to live in Christ,
20 and by him God reconciled
everything to himself. He made peace
with everything in heaven and on earth
by means of his blood on the cross.
21 This includes you who were once
so far away from God. You were his
enemies, separated from him by your
evil thoughts and ac ons,COLOSSIANS 1
5
22 yet now he has brought you back as
his friends. He has done this through his
death on the cross in his own human
body. As a result, he has brought you
into the very presence of God, and you
are holy and blameless as you stand
before him without a single fault.
23 But you must con nue to believe this
truth and stand in it ﬁrmly. Don’t dri
away from the assurance you received
when you heard the Good News. The
Good News has been preached all
over the world, and I, Paul, have been
appointed by God to proclaim it.
24 I am glad when I suﬀer for you in my
body, for I am comple ng what remains
of Christ’s suﬀerings for his body, the
church.
25 God has given me the responsibility
of serving his church by proclaiming
his message in all its fullness to you
Gen les.COLOSSIANS 1 – 2
6
26 This message was kept secret for
centuries and genera ons past, but now
it has been revealed to his own holy
people.
27 For it has pleased God to tell his
people that the riches and glory of Christ
are for you Gen les, too. For this is the
secret: Christ lives in you, and this is your
assurance that you will share in his glory.
28 So everywhere we go, we tell
everyone about Christ. We warn them
and teach them with all the wisdom God
has given us, for we want to present
them to God, perfect in their rela onship
to Christ.
29 I work very hard at this, as I depend
on Christ’s mighty power that works
within me.
1 I want you to know how much I
have agonized for you and for the
church at Laodicea, and for many other
2COLOSSIANS 2
7
friends who have never known me
personally.
2 My goal is that they will be
encouraged and knit together by strong
es of love. I want them to have full
conﬁdence because they have complete
understanding of God’s secret plan,
which is Christ himself.
3 In him lie hidden all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.
4 I am telling you this so that no one will
be able to deceive you with persuasive
arguments.
5 For though I am far away from you, my
heart is with you. And I am very happy
because you are living as you should and
because of your strong faith in Christ.
6 And now, just as you accepted Christ
Jesus as your Lord, you must con nue to
live in obedience to him.
7 Let your roots grow down into him
and draw up nourishment from him,COLOSSIANS 2
8
so you will grow in faith, strong and
vigorous in the truth you were taught.
Let your lives overﬂow with thanksgiving
for all he has done.
8 Don’t let anyone lead you astray with
empty philosophy and high–sounding
nonsense that come from human
thinking and from the evil powers of this
world, and not from Christ.
9 For in Christ the fullness of God lives
in a human body,
10 and you are complete through your
union with Christ. He is the Lord over
every ruler and authority in the universe.
11 When you came to Christ, you
were "circumcised," but not by a
physical procedure. It was a spiritual
procedure––the cu ng away of your
sinful nature.
12 For you were buried with Christ when
you were bap zed. And with him you
were raised to a new life because youCOLOSSIANS 2
9
trusted the mighty power of God, who
raised Christ from the dead.
13 You were dead because of your sins
and because your sinful nature was not
yet cut away. Then God made you alive
with Christ. He forgave all our sins.
14 He canceled the record that
contained the charges against us. He
took it and destroyed it by nailing it to
Christ’s cross.
15 In this way, God disarmed the evil
rulers and authori es. He shamed them
publicly by his victory over them on the
cross of Christ.
16 So don’t let anyone condemn
you for what you eat or drink, or for
not celebra ng certain holy days or
new–moon ceremonies or Sabbaths.
17 For these rules were only shadows of
the real thing, Christ himself.
18 Don’t let anyone condemn you by
insis ng on self–denial. And don’t letCOLOSSIANS 2
10
anyone say you must worship angels,
even though they say they have had
visions about this. These people claim
to be so humble, but their sinful minds
have made them proud.
19 But they are not connected to Christ,
the head of the body. For we are joined
together in his body by his strong
sinews, and we grow only as we get our
nourishment and strength from God.
20 You have died with Christ, and he has
set you free from the evil powers of this
world. So why do you keep on following
rules of the world, such as,
21 "Don’t handle, don’t eat, don’t
touch."
22 Such rules are mere human teaching
about things that are gone as soon as we
use them.
23 These rules may seem wise because
they require strong devo on, humility,
and severe bodily discipline. But theyCOLOSSIANS 3
11
have no eﬀect when it comes to
conquering a person’s evil thoughts and
desires.
1 Since you have been raised to new
life with Christ, set your sights on the
reali es of heaven, where Christ sits at
God’s right hand in the place of honor
and power.
2 Let heaven ﬁll your thoughts. Do not
think only about things down here on
earth.
3 For you died when Christ died, and
your real life is hidden with Christ in God.
4 And when Christ, who is your real life,
is revealed to the whole world, you will
share in all his glory.
5 So put to death the sinful, earthly
things lurking within you. Have nothing
to do with sexual sin, impurity, lust, and
shameful desires. Don’t be greedy for
the good things of this life, for that is
idolatry.
3COLOSSIANS 3
12
6 God’s terrible anger will come upon
those who do such things.
7 You used to do them when your life
was s ll part of this world.
8 But now is the me to get rid of anger,
rage, malicious behavior, slander, and
dirty language.
9 Don’t lie to each other, for you have
stripped oﬀ your old evil nature and all
its wicked deeds.
10 In its place you have clothed
yourselves with a brand–new nature
that is con nually being renewed as you
learn more and more about Christ, who
created this new nature within you.
11 In this new life, it doesn’t ma er if
you are a Jew or a Gen le, circumcised
or uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilized,
slave, or free. Christ is all that ma ers,
and he lives in all of us.
12 Since God chose you to be the holy
people whom he loves, you must clotheCOLOSSIANS 3
13
yourselves with tenderhearted mercy,
kindness, humility, gentleness, and
pa ence.
13 You must make allowance for each
other’s faults and forgive the person
who oﬀends you. Remember, the Lord
forgave you, so you must forgive others.
14 And the most important piece of
clothing you must wear is love. Love is
what binds us all together in perfect
harmony.
15 And let the peace that comes
from Christ rule in your hearts. For as
members of one body you are all called
to live in peace. And always be thankful.
16 Let the words of Christ, in all their
richness, live in your hearts and make
you wise. Use his words to teach and
counsel each other. Sing psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs to God with
thankful hearts.COLOSSIANS 3
14
17 And whatever you do or say, let it be
as a representa ve of the Lord Jesus, all
the while giving thanks through him to
God the Father.
18 You wives must submit to your
husbands, as is ﬁ ng for those who
belong to the Lord.
19 And you husbands must love your
wives and never treat them harshly.
20 You children must always obey your
parents, for this is what pleases the Lord.
21 Fathers, don’t aggravate your
children. If you do, they will become
discouraged and quit trying.
22 You slaves must obey your earthly
masters in everything you do. Try to
please them all the me, not just when
they are watching you. Obey them
willingly because of your reverent fear of
the Lord.COLOSSIANS 3 – 4
15
23 Work hard and cheerfully at whatever
you do, as though you were working for
the Lord rather than for people.
24 Remember that the Lord will give you
an inheritance as your reward, and the
Master you are serving is Christ.
25 But if you do what is wrong, you will
be paid back for the wrong you have
done. For God has no favorites who can
get away with evil.
1 You slave owners must be just and
fair to your slaves. Remember that
you also have a Master––in heaven.
2 Devote yourselves to prayer with an
alert mind and a thankful heart.
3 Don’t forget to pray for us, too, that
God will give us many opportuni es
to preach about his secret plan––that
Christ is also for you Gen les. That is
why I am here in chains.
4 Pray that I will proclaim this message
as clearly as I should.

Chris ans, and make the most of every

6 Let your conversa on be gracious and

answer for everyone.
7 Tychicus, a much loved brother, will
tell you how I am ge ng along. He is a
faithful helper who serves the Lord with
me.
8 I have sent him on this special trip to
let you know how we are doing and to
encourage you.
9 I am also sending Onesimus, a faithful
and much loved brother, one of your
own people. He and Tychicus will give
you all the latest news.
10 Aristarchus, who is in prison with
me, sends you his gree ngs, and so
does Mark, Barnabas’s cousin. And as
you were instructed before, make Mark
welcome if he comes your way.COLOSSIANS 4

11 Jesus (the one we call Justus) also
sends his gree ngs. These are the only
Jewish Chris ans among my co–workers;
they are working with me here for the
Kingdom of God. And what a comfort
they have been!
12 Epaphras, from your city, a servant
of Christ Jesus, sends you his gree ngs.
He always prays earnestly for you, asking
God to make you strong and perfect,
fully conﬁdent of the whole will of God.
13 I can assure you that he has agonized
for you and also for the Chris ans in
Laodicea and Hierapolis.
14 Dear Doctor Luke sends his gree ngs,
and so does Demas.
15 Please give my gree ngs to our
Chris an brothers and sisters at
Laodicea, and to Nympha and those who
meet in her house.
16 A er you have read this le er, pass
it on to the church at Laodicea so theyCOLOSSIANS 4
18
can read it, too. And you should read the
le er I wrote to them.
17 And say to Archippus, "Be sure to
carry out the work the Lord gave you."
18 Here is my gree ng in my own
handwri ng––PAUL. Remember my
chains. May the grace of God be with
you.1 Thessalonians
1 This le
er is from Paul, Silas, and
Timothy. It is wri en to the church
in Thessalonica, you who belong to God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
May his grace and peace be yours.
2 We always thank God for all of you
and pray for you constantly.
3 As we talk to our God and Father
about you, we think of your faithful
work, your loving deeds, and your
con nual an cipa on of the return of
our Lord Jesus Christ.
4 We know that God loves you, dear
brothers and sisters, and that he chose
you to be his own people.
5 For when we brought you the Good
News, it was not only with words but
also with power, for the Holy Spirit gave
11 THESSALONIANS 1
2
you full assurance that what we said was
true. And you know that the way we
lived among you was further proof of
the truth of our message.
6 So you received the message with joy
from the Holy Spirit in spite of the severe
suﬀering it brought you. In this way, you
imitated both us and the Lord.
7 As a result, you yourselves became an
example to all the Chris ans in Greece.
8 And now the word of the Lord
is ringing out from you to people
everywhere, even beyond Greece, for
wherever we go we ﬁnd people telling us
about your faith in God. We don’t need
to tell them about it,
9 for they themselves keep talking
about the wonderful welcome you gave
us and how you turned away from idols
to serve the true and living God.
10 And they speak of how you are
looking forward to the coming of God’s1 THESSALONIANS 2
3
Son from heaven––Jesus, whom God
raised from the dead. He is the one who
has rescued us from the terrors of the
coming judgment.
1 You yourselves know, dear brothers
and sisters, that our visit to you was
not a failure.
2 You know how badly we had been
treated at Philippi just before we came
to you and how much we suﬀered there.
Yet our God gave us the courage to
declare his Good News to you boldly,
even though we were surrounded by
many who opposed us.
3 So you can see that we were not
preaching with any deceit or impure
purposes or trickery.
4 For we speak as messengers who have
been approved by God to be entrusted
with the Good News. Our purpose is to
please God, not people. He is the one
who examines the mo ves of our hearts.
21 THESSALONIANS 2
4
5 Never once did we try to win you with
ﬂa ery, as you very well know. And God
is our witness that we were not just
pretending to be your friends so you
would give us money!
6 As for praise, we have never asked for
it from you or anyone else.
7 As apostles of Christ we certainly had
a right to make some demands of you,
but we were as gentle among you as a
mother feeding and caring for her own
children.
8 We loved you so much that we gave
you not only God’s Good News but our
own lives, too.
9 Don’t you remember, dear brothers
and sisters, how hard we worked among
you? Night and day we toiled to earn
a living so that our expenses would
not be a burden to anyone there as we
preached God’s Good News among you.1 THESSALONIANS 2
5
10 You yourselves are our witnesses––
and so is God––that we were pure and
honest and faultless toward all of you
believers.
11 And you know that we treated each
of you as a father treats his own children.
12 We pleaded with you, encouraged
you, and urged you to live your lives in
a way that God would consider worthy.
For he called you into his Kingdom to
share his glory.
13 And we will never stop thanking God
that when we preached his message
to you, you didn’t think of the words
we spoke as being just our own. You
accepted what we said as the very word
of God––which, of course, it was. And
this word con nues to work in you who
believe.
14 And then, dear brothers and sisters,
you suﬀered persecu on from your own
countrymen. In this way, you imitated1 THESSALONIANS 2
6
the believers in God’s churches in Judea
who, because of their belief in Christ
Jesus, suﬀered from their own people,
the Jews.
15 For some of the Jews had killed their
own prophets, and some even killed the
Lord Jesus. Now they have persecuted
us and driven us out. They displease God
and oppose everyone
16 by trying to keep us from preaching
the Good News to the Gen les, for fear
some might be saved. By doing this, they
con nue to pile up their sins. But the
anger of God has caught up with them at
last.
17 Dear brothers and sisters, a er we
were separated from you for a li le
while (though our hearts never le you),
we tried very hard to come back because
of our intense longing to see you again.1 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
7
18 We wanted very much to come, and
I, Paul, tried again and again, but Satan
prevented us.
19 A er all, what gives us hope and
joy, and what is our proud reward and
crown? It is you! Yes, you will bring us
much joy as we stand together before
our Lord Jesus when he comes back
again.
20 For you are our pride and joy.
1 Finally, when we could stand it no
longer, we decided that I should stay
alone in Athens,
2 and we sent Timothy to visit you.
He is our co–worker for God and our
brother in proclaiming the Good News of
Christ. We sent him to strengthen you,
to encourage you in your faith,
3 and to keep you from becoming
disturbed by the troubles you were
going through. But, of course, you know
31 THESSALONIANS 3
8
that such troubles are going to happen
to us Chris ans.
4 Even while we were with you, we
warned you that troubles would soon
come––and they did, as you well know.
5 That is why, when I could bear it
no longer, I sent Timothy to ﬁnd out
whether your faith was s ll strong. I was
afraid that the Tempter had go en the
best of you and that all our work had
been useless.
6 Now Timothy has just returned,
bringing the good news that your faith
and love are as strong as ever. He reports
that you remember our visit with joy and
that you want to see us just as much as
we want to see you.
7 So we have been greatly comforted,
dear brothers and sisters, in all of our
own crushing troubles and suﬀering,
because you have remained strong in
your faith.1 THESSALONIANS 3
9
8 It gives us new life, knowing you
remain strong in the Lord.
9 How we thank God for you! Because
of you we have great joy in the presence
of God.
10 Night and day we pray earnestly for
you, asking God to let us see you again to
ﬁll up anything that may s ll be missing
in your faith.
11 May God himself, our Father, and
our Lord Jesus make it possible for us to
come to you very soon.
12 And may the Lord make your love
grow and overﬂow to each other and to
everyone else, just as our love overﬂows
toward you.
13 As a result, Christ will make your
hearts strong, blameless, and holy when
you stand before God our Father on that
day when our Lord Jesus comes with all
those who belong to him.1 THESSALONIANS 4

1 Finally, dear brothers and sisters,
we urge you in the name of the Lord
Jesus to live in a way that pleases God,
as we have taught you. You are doing
this already, and we encourage you to
do so more and more.
2 For you remember what we taught
you in the name of the Lord Jesus.
3 God wants you to be holy, so you
should keep clear of all sexual sin.
4 Then each of you will control your
body and live in holiness and honor––
5 not in lus ul passion as the pagans do,
in their ignorance of God and his ways.
6 Never cheat a Chris an brother in
this ma er by taking his wife, for the
Lord avenges all such sins, as we have
solemnly warned you before.
7 God has called us to be holy, not to
live impure lives.
8 Anyone who refuses to live by these
rules is not disobeying human rules but1 THESSALONIANS 4
11
is rejec ng God, who gives his Holy Spirit
to you.
9 But I don’t need to write to you about
the Chris an love that should be shown
among God’s people. For God himself
has taught you to love one another.
10 Indeed, your love is already strong
toward all the Chris ans in all of
Macedonia. Even so, dear brothers and
sisters, we beg you to love them more
and more.
11 This should be your ambi on: to live
a quiet life, minding your own business
and working with your hands, just as we
commanded you before.
12 As a result, people who are not
Chris ans will respect the way you live,
and you will not need to depend on
others to meet your ﬁnancial needs.
13 And now, brothers and sisters, I want
you to know what will happen to the
Chris ans who have died so you will not1 THESSALONIANS 4
12
be full of sorrow like people who have
no hope.
14 For since we believe that Jesus died
and was raised to life again, we also
believe that when Jesus comes, God will
bring back with Jesus all the Chris ans
who have died.
15 I can tell you this directly from the
Lord: We who are s ll living when the
Lord returns will not rise to meet him
ahead of those who are in their graves.
16 For the Lord himself will come down
from heaven with a commanding shout,
with the call of the archangel, and with
the trumpet call of God. First, all the
Chris ans who have died will rise from
their graves.
17 Then, together with them, we who
are s ll alive and remain on the earth
will be caught up in the clouds to meet
the Lord in the air and remain with him
forever.1 THESSALONIANS 4 – 5
13
18 So comfort and encourage each
other with these words.
1 I really don’t need to write to you
about how and when all this will
happen, dear brothers and sisters.
2 For you know quite well that the day
of the Lord will come unexpectedly, like
a thief in the night.
3 When people are saying, "All is well;
everything is peaceful and secure," then
disaster will fall upon them as suddenly
as a woman’s birth pains begin when her
child is about to be born. And there will
be no escape.
4 But you aren’t in the dark about these
things, dear brothers and sisters, and
you won’t be surprised when the day of
the Lord comes like a thief.
5 For you are all children of the light and
of the day; we don’t belong to darkness
and night.
51 THESSALONIANS 5
14
6 So be on your guard, not asleep like
the others. Stay alert and be sober.
7 Night is the me for sleep and the
me when people get drunk.
8 But let us who live in the light think
clearly, protected by the body armor
of faith and love, and wearing as our
helmet the conﬁdence of our salva on.
9 For God decided to save us through
our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his
anger on us.
10 He died for us so that we can live
with him forever, whether we are dead
or alive at the me of his return.
11 So encourage each other and build
each other up, just as you are already
doing.
12 Dear brothers and sisters, honor
those who are your leaders in the Lord’s
work. They work hard among you and
warn you against all that is wrong.1 THESSALONIANS 5
15
13 Think highly of them and give them
your wholehearted love because of their
work. And remember to live peaceably
with each other.
14 Brothers and sisters, we urge you
to warn those who are lazy. Encourage
those who are mid. Take tender care
of those who are weak. Be pa ent with
everyone.
15 See that no one pays back evil for
evil, but always try to do good to each
other and to everyone else.
16 Always be joyful.
17 Keep on praying.
18 No ma er what happens, always be
thankful, for this is God’s will for you
who belong to Christ Jesus.
19 Do not s ﬂe the Holy Spirit.
20 Do not scoﬀ at prophecies,
21 but test everything that is said. Hold
on to what is good.
22 Keep away from every kind of evil.1 THESSALONIANS 5
16
23 Now may the God of peace make
you holy in every way, and may your
whole spirit and soul and body be kept
blameless un l that day when our Lord
Jesus Christ comes again.
24 God, who calls you, is faithful; he will
do this.
25 Dear brothers and sisters, pray for us.
26 Greet all the brothers and sisters in
Chris an love.
27 I command you in the name of the
Lord to read this le er to all the brothers
and sisters.
28 And may the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with all of you.2 Thessalonians
1 This le
er is from Paul, Silas, and
Timothy. It is wri en to the church
in Thessalonica, you who belong to God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 May God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
3 Dear brothers and sisters, we always
thank God for you, as is right, for we are
thankful that your faith is ﬂourishing
and you are all growing in love for each
other.
4 We proudly tell God’s other churches
about your endurance and faithfulness
in all the persecu ons and hardships you
are suﬀering.
5 But God will use this persecu on to
show his jus ce. For he will make you
12 THESSALONIANS 1
2
worthy of his Kingdom, for which you
are suﬀering,
6 and in his jus ce he will punish those
who persecute you.
7 And God will provide rest for you
who are being persecuted and also for
us when the Lord Jesus appears from
heaven. He will come with his mighty
angels,
8 in ﬂaming ﬁre, bringing judgment on
those who don’t know God and on those
who refuse to obey the Good News of
our Lord Jesus.
9 They will be punished with everlas ng
destruc on, forever separated from the
Lord and from his glorious power
10 when he comes to receive glory and
praise from his holy people. And you will
be among those praising him on that
day, for you believed what we tes ﬁed
about him.2 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
3
11 And so we keep on praying for you,
that our God will make you worthy of
the life to which he called you. And we
pray that God, by his power, will fulﬁll all
your good inten ons and faithful deeds.
12 Then everyone will give honor to the
name of our Lord Jesus because of you,
and you will be honored along with him.
This is all made possible because of the
undeserved favor of our God and Lord,
Jesus Christ.
1 And now, brothers and sisters, let
us tell you about the coming again of
our Lord Jesus Christ and how we will be
gathered together to meet him.
2 Please don’t be so easily shaken and
troubled by those who say that the day
of the Lord has already begun. Even
if they claim to have had a vision, a
revela on, or a le er supposedly from
us, don’t believe them.
22 THESSALONIANS 2
4
3 Don’t be fooled by what they say. For
that day will not come un l there is a
great rebellion against God and the man
of lawlessness is revealed––the one who
brings destruc on.
4 He will exalt himself and defy every
god there is and tear down every
object of adora on and worship. He will
posi on himself in the temple of God,
claiming that he himself is God.
5 Don’t you remember that I told you
this when I was with you?
6 And you know what is holding him
back, for he can be revealed only when
his me comes.
7 For this lawlessness is already at work
secretly, and it will remain secret un l
the one who is holding it back steps out
of the way.
8 Then the man of lawlessness will
be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will
consume with the breath of his mouth2 THESSALONIANS 2
5
and destroy by the splendor of his
coming.
9 This evil man will come to do the work
of Satan with counterfeit power and
signs and miracles.
10 He will use every kind of wicked
decep on to fool those who are on their
way to destruc on because they refuse
to believe the truth that would save
them.
11 So God will send great decep on
upon them, and they will believe all
these lies.
12 Then they will be condemned for not
believing the truth and for enjoying the
evil they do.
13 As for us, we always thank God for
you, dear brothers and sisters loved by
the Lord. We are thankful that God chose
you to be among the ﬁrst to experience
salva on, a salva on that came through2 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
the Spirit who makes you holy and by
your belief in the truth.
14 He called you to salva on when we
told you the Good News; now you can
share in the glory of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
15 With all these things in mind, dear
brothers and sisters, stand ﬁrm and keep
a strong grip on everything we taught
you both in person and by le er.
16 May our Lord Jesus Christ and God
our Father, who loved us and in his
special favor gave us everlas ng comfort
and good hope,
17 comfort your hearts and give you
strength in every good thing you do and
say.
1 Finally, dear brothers and sisters, I
ask you to pray for us. Pray ﬁrst that
the Lord’s message will spread rapidly
and be honored wherever it goes, just as
when it came to you.
32 THESSALONIANS 3
7
2 Pray, too, that we will be saved from
wicked and evil people, for not everyone
believes in the Lord.
3 But the Lord is faithful; he will make
you strong and guard you from the evil
one.
4 And we are conﬁdent in the Lord
that you are prac cing the things we
commanded you, and that you always
will.
5 May the Lord bring you into an ever
deeper understanding of the love of God
and the endurance that comes from
Christ.
6 And now, dear brothers and sisters,
we give you this command with the
authority of our Lord Jesus Christ: Stay
away from any Chris an who lives in
idleness and doesn’t follow the tradi on
of hard work we gave you.2 THESSALONIANS 3
8
7 For you know that you ought to follow
our example. We were never lazy when
we were with you.
8 We never accepted food from anyone
without paying for it. We worked hard
day and night so that we would not be a
burden to any of you.
9 It wasn’t that we didn’t have the right
to ask you to feed us, but we wanted to
give you an example to follow.
10 Even while we were with you, we
gave you this rule: "Whoever does not
work should not eat."
11 Yet we hear that some of you are
living idle lives, refusing to work and
was ng me meddling in other people’s
business.
12 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
we appeal to such people––no, we
command them: Se le down and get to
work. Earn your own living.2 THESSALONIANS 3
9
13 And I say to the rest of you, dear
brothers and sisters, never get red of
doing good.
14 Take note of those who refuse to
obey what we say in this le er. Stay away
from them so they will be ashamed.
15 Don’t think of them as enemies,
but speak to them as you would to a
Chris an who needs to be warned.
16 May the Lord of peace himself always
give you his peace no ma er what
happens. The Lord be with you all.
17 Now here is my gree ng, which I
write with my own hand––PAUL. I do
this at the end of all my le ers to prove
that they really are from me.
18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all.1 Timothy
1 This le
er is from Paul, an apostle
of Christ Jesus, appointed by the
command of God our Savior and by
Christ Jesus our hope.
2 It is wri en to Timothy, my true child
in the faith. May God our Father and
Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace,
mercy, and peace.
3 When I le for Macedonia, I urged you
to stay there in Ephesus and stop those
who are teaching wrong doctrine.
4 Don’t let people waste me in endless
specula on over myths and spiritual
pedigrees. For these things only cause
arguments; they don’t help people live a
life of faith in God.
5 The purpose of my instruc on is that
all the Chris ans there would be ﬁlled
11 TIMOTHY 1
2
with love that comes from a pure heart,
a clear conscience, and sincere faith.
6 But some teachers have missed this
whole point. They have turned away
from these things and spend their me
arguing and talking foolishness.
7 They want to be known as teachers
of the law of Moses, but they don’t
know what they are talking about, even
though they seem so conﬁdent.
8 We know these laws are good when
they are used as God intended.
9 But they were not made for people
who do what is right. They are for people
who are disobedient and rebellious, who
are ungodly and sinful, who consider
nothing sacred and deﬁle what is holy,
who murder their father or mother or
other people.
10 These laws are for people who are
sexually immoral, for homosexuals and
slave traders, for liars and oath breakers,1 TIMOTHY 1
3
and for those who do anything else that
contradicts the right teaching
11 that comes from the glorious Good
News entrusted to me by our blessed
God.
12 How thankful I am to Christ Jesus our
Lord for considering me trustworthy and
appoin ng me to serve him,
13 even though I used to scoﬀ at
the name of Christ. I hunted down
his people, harming them in every
way I could. But God had mercy on
me because I did it in ignorance and
unbelief.
14 Oh, how kind and gracious the Lord
was! He ﬁlled me completely with faith
and the love of Christ Jesus.
15 This is a true saying, and everyone
should believe it: Christ Jesus came into
the world to save sinners––and I was the
worst of them all.1 TIMOTHY 1
4
16 But that is why God had mercy on
me, so that Christ Jesus could use me as
a prime example of his great pa ence
with even the worst sinners. Then others
will realize that they, too, can believe in
him and receive eternal life.
17 Glory and honor to God forever and
ever. He is the eternal King, the unseen
one who never dies; he alone is God.
Amen.
18 Timothy, my son, here are my
instruc ons for you, based on the
prophe c words spoken about you
earlier. May they give you the conﬁdence
to ﬁght well in the Lord’s ba les.
19 Cling ghtly to your faith in Christ,
and always keep your conscience clear.
For some people have deliberately
violated their consciences; as a result,
their faith has been shipwrecked.
20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are two
examples of this. I turned them over1 TIMOTHY 2
5
to Satan so they would learn not to
blaspheme God.
1 I urge you, ﬁrst of all, to pray for all
people. As you make your requests,
plead for God’s mercy upon them, and
give thanks.
2 Pray this way for kings and all others
who are in authority, so that we can live
in peace and quietness, in godliness and
dignity.
3 This is good and pleases God our
Savior,
4 for he wants everyone to be saved
and to understand the truth.
5 For there is only one God and one
Mediator who can reconcile God and
people. He is the man Christ Jesus.
6 He gave his life to purchase freedom
for everyone. This is the message that
God gave to the world at the proper
me.
21 TIMOTHY 2
6
7 And I have been chosen––this is
the absolute truth––as a preacher and
apostle to teach the Gen les about faith
and truth.
8 So wherever you assemble, I want
men to pray with holy hands li ed up to
God, free from anger and controversy.
9 And I want women to be modest in
their appearance. They should wear
decent and appropriate clothing and not
draw a en on to themselves by the way
they ﬁx their hair or by wearing gold or
pearls or expensive clothes.
10 For women who claim to be devoted
to God should make themselves
a rac ve by the good things they do.
11 Women should listen and learn
quietly and submissively.
12 I do not let women teach men or
have authority over them. Let them
listen quietly.1 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
7
13 For God made Adam ﬁrst, and
a erward he made Eve.
14 And it was the woman, not Adam,
who was deceived by Satan, and sin was
the result.
15 But women will be saved through
childbearing and by con nuing to live in
faith, love, holiness, and modesty.
1 It is a true saying that if someone
wants to be an elder, he desires an
honorable responsibility.
2 For an elder must be a man whose
life cannot be spoken against. He must
be faithful to his wife. He must exhibit
self–control, live wisely, and have a good
reputa on. He must enjoy having guests
in his home and must be able to teach.
3 He must not be a heavy drinker or be
violent. He must be gentle, peace loving,
and not one who loves money.
4 He must manage his own family well,
with children who respect and obey him.
31 TIMOTHY 3
8
5 For if a man cannot manage his own
household, how can he take care of
God’s church?
6 An elder must not be a new Chris an,
because he might be proud of being
chosen so soon, and the Devil will use
that pride to make him fall.
7 Also, people outside the church must
speak well of him so that he will not fall
into the Devil’s trap and be disgraced.
8 In the same way, deacons must be
people who are respected and have
integrity. They must not be heavy
drinkers and must not be greedy for
money.
9 They must be commi ed to the
revealed truths of the Chris an faith and
must live with a clear conscience.
10 Before they are appointed as
deacons, they should be given other
responsibili es in the church as a test1 TIMOTHY 3
9
of their character and ability. If they do
well, then they may serve as deacons.
11 In the same way, their wives must
be respected and must not speak evil of
others. They must exercise self–control
and be faithful in everything they do.
12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife,
and he must manage his children and
household well.
13 Those who do well as deacons will be
rewarded with respect from others and
will have increased conﬁdence in their
faith in Christ Jesus.
14 I am wri ng these things to you now,
even though I hope to be with you soon,
15 so that if I can’t come for a while,
you will know how people must conduct
themselves in the household of God.
This is the church of the living God,
which is the pillar and support of the
truth.1 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
16 Without ques
10
on, this is the great
mystery of our faith: Christ appeared in
the ﬂesh and was shown to be righteous
by the Spirit. He was seen by angels and
was announced to the na ons. He was
believed on in the world and was taken
up into heaven.
1 Now the Holy Spirit tells us clearly
that in the last mes some will turn
away from what we believe; they will
follow lying spirits and teachings that
come from demons.
2 These teachers are hypocrites and
liars. They pretend to be religious, but
their consciences are dead.
3 They will say it is wrong to be married
and wrong to eat certain foods. But God
created those foods to be eaten with
thanksgiving by people who know and
believe the truth.
41 TIMOTHY 4
11
4 Since everything God created is good,
we should not reject any of it. We may
receive it gladly, with thankful hearts.
5 For we know it is made holy by the
word of God and prayer.
6 If you explain this to the brothers and
sisters, you will be doing your duty as a
worthy servant of Christ Jesus, one who
is fed by the message of faith and the
true teaching you have followed.
7 Do not waste me arguing over
godless ideas and old wives’ tales. Spend
your me and energy in training yourself
for spiritual ﬁtness.
8 Physical exercise has some value,
but spiritual exercise is much more
important, for it promises a reward in
both this life and the next.
9 This is true, and everyone should
accept it.
10 We work hard and suﬀer much in
order that people will believe the truth,1 TIMOTHY 4
12
for our hope is in the living God, who is
the Savior of all people, and par cularly
of those who believe.
11 Teach these things and insist that
everyone learn them.
12 Don’t let anyone think less of you
because you are young. Be an example
to all believers in what you teach, in the
way you live, in your love, your faith, and
your purity.
13 Un l I get there, focus on reading the
Scriptures to the church, encouraging
the believers, and teaching them.
14 Do not neglect the spiritual gi you
received through the prophecies spoken
to you when the elders of the church laid
their hands on you.
15 Give your complete a en on to
these ma ers. Throw yourself into your
tasks so that everyone will see your
progress.1 TIMOTHY 4 – 5
13
16 Keep a close watch on yourself and
on your teaching. Stay true to what is
right, and God will save you and those
who hear you.
1 Never speak harshly to an older
man, but appeal to him respec ully
as though he were your own father. Talk
to the younger men as you would to
your own brothers.
2 Treat the older women as you would
your mother, and treat the younger
women with all purity as your own
sisters.
3 The church should care for any widow
who has no one else to care for her.
4 But if she has children or
grandchildren, their ﬁrst responsibility
is to show godliness at home and repay
their parents by taking care of them.
This is something that pleases God very
much.
51 TIMOTHY 5
14
5 But a woman who is a true widow,
one who is truly alone in this world, has
placed her hope in God. Night and day
she asks God for help and spends much
me in prayer.
6 But the widow who lives only for
pleasure is spiritually dead.
7 Give these instruc ons to the church
so that the widows you support will not
be cri cized.
8 But those who won’t care for their
own rela ves, especially those living in
the same household, have denied what
we believe. Such people are worse than
unbelievers.
9 A widow who is put on the list for
support must be a woman who is at
least sixty years old and was faithful to
her husband.
10 She must be well respected by
everyone because of the good she has
done. Has she brought up her children1 TIMOTHY 5
15
well? Has she been kind to strangers?
Has she served other Chris ans humbly?
Has she helped those who are in
trouble? Has she always been ready to
do good?
11 The younger widows should not be
on the list, because their physical desires
will overpower their devo on to Christ
and they will want to remarry.
12 Then they would be guilty of breaking
their previous pledge.
13 Besides, they are likely to become
lazy and spend their me gossiping
from house to house, ge ng into other
people’s business and saying things they
shouldn’t.
14 So I advise these younger widows to
marry again, have children, and take care
of their own homes. Then the enemy
will not be able to say anything against
them.1 TIMOTHY 5
16
15 For I am afraid that some of them
have already gone astray and now follow
Satan.
16 If a Chris an woman has rela ves
who are widows, she must take care of
them and not put the responsibility on
the church. Then the church can care for
widows who are truly alone.
17 Elders who do their work well should
be paid well, especially those who work
hard at both preaching and teaching.
18 For the Scripture says, "Do not keep
an ox from ea ng as it treads out the
grain." And in another place, "Those
who work deserve their pay!"
19 Do not listen to complaints against
an elder unless there are two or three
witnesses to accuse him.
20 Anyone who sins should be rebuked
in front of the whole church so that
others will have a proper fear of God.1 TIMOTHY 5 – 6
17
21 I solemnly command you in the
presence of God and Christ Jesus and the
holy angels to obey these instruc ons
without taking sides or showing special
favor to anyone.
22 Never be in a hurry about appoin ng
an elder. Do not par cipate in the sins of
others. Keep yourself pure.
23 Don’t drink only water. You ought to
drink a li le wine for the sake of your
stomach because you are sick so o en.
24 Remember that some people lead
sinful lives, and everyone knows they
will be judged. But there are others
whose sin will not be revealed un l later.
25 In the same way, everyone knows
how much good some people do, but
there are others whose good deeds
won’t be known un l later.
1 Chris ans who are slaves should
give their masters full respect so that
61 TIMOTHY 6
18
the name of God and his teaching will
not be shamed.
2 If your master is a Chris an, that is
no excuse for being disrespec ul. You
should work all the harder because you
are helping another believer by your
eﬀorts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and
encourage everyone to obey them.
3 Some false teachers may deny
these things, but these are the sound,
wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and they are the founda on for a
godly life.
4 Anyone who teaches anything
diﬀerent is both conceited and ignorant.
Such a person has an unhealthy desire to
quibble over the meaning of words. This
s rs up arguments ending in jealousy,
ﬁgh ng, slander, and evil suspicions.
5 These people always cause trouble.
Their minds are corrupt, and they don’t1 TIMOTHY 6
19
tell the truth. To them religion is just a
way to get rich.
6 Yet true religion with contentment is
great wealth.
7 A er all, we didn’t bring anything with
us when we came into the world, and
we certainly cannot carry anything with
us when we die.
8 So if we have enough food and
clothing, let us be content.
9 But people who long to be rich fall
into tempta on and are trapped by
many foolish and harmful desires that
plunge them into ruin and destruc on.
10 For the love of money is at the root
of all kinds of evil. And some people,
craving money, have wandered from the
faith and pierced themselves with many
sorrows.
11 But you, Timothy, belong to God; so
run from all these evil things, and follow
what is right and good. Pursue a godly1 TIMOTHY 6
20
life, along with faith, love, perseverance,
and gentleness.
12 Fight the good ﬁght for what we
believe. Hold ghtly to the eternal life
that God has given you, which you
have confessed so well before many
witnesses.
13 And I command you before God,
who gives life to all, and before Christ
Jesus, who gave a good tes mony before
Pon us Pilate,
14 that you obey his commands with all
purity. Then no one can ﬁnd fault with
you from now un l our Lord Jesus Christ
returns.
15 For at the right me Christ will be
revealed from heaven by the blessed
and only almighty God, the King of kings
and Lord of lords.
16 He alone can never die, and he lives
in light so brilliant that no human can
approach him. No one has ever seen1 TIMOTHY 6
21
him, nor ever will. To him be honor and
power forever. Amen.
17 Tell those who are rich in this world
not to be proud and not to trust in their
money, which will soon be gone. But
their trust should be in the living God,
who richly gives us all we need for our
enjoyment.
18 Tell them to use their money to do
good. They should be rich in good works
and should give generously to those in
need, always being ready to share with
others whatever God has given them.
19 By doing this they will be storing up
their treasure as a good founda on for
the future so that they may take hold of
real life.
20 Timothy, guard what God has
entrusted to you. Avoid godless, foolish
discussions with those who oppose you
with their so–called knowledge.1 TIMOTHY 6
22
21 Some people have wandered from
the faith by following such foolishness.
May God’s grace be with you all.2 Timothy
1 This le
er is from Paul, an apostle
of Christ Jesus by God’s will, sent
out to tell others about the life he has
promised through faith in Christ Jesus.
2 It is wri en to Timothy, my dear son.
May God our Father and Christ Jesus our
Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace.
3 Timothy, I thank God for you. He is
the God I serve with a clear conscience,
just as my ancestors did. Night and day I
constantly remember you in my prayers.
4 I long to see you again, for I remember
your tears as we parted. And I will be
ﬁlled with joy when we are together
again.
5 I know that you sincerely trust the
Lord, for you have the faith of your
12 TIMOTHY 1
2
mother, Eunice, and your grandmother,
Lois.
6 This is why I remind you to fan into
ﬂames the spiritual gi God gave you
when I laid my hands on you.
7 For God has not given us a spirit of
fear and midity, but of power, love, and
self–discipline.
8 So you must never be ashamed to
tell others about our Lord. And don’t be
ashamed of me, either, even though I’m
in prison for Christ. With the strength
God gives you, be ready to suﬀer with
me for the proclama on of the Good
News.
9 It is God who saved us and chose us to
live a holy life. He did this not because
we deserved it, but because that was his
plan long before the world began––to
show his love and kindness to us through
Christ Jesus.2 TIMOTHY 1
3
10 And now he has made all of this plain
to us by the coming of Christ Jesus, our
Savior, who broke the power of death
and showed us the way to everlas ng
life through the Good News.
11 And God chose me to be a preacher,
an apostle, and a teacher of this Good
News.
12 And that is why I am suﬀering here
in prison. But I am not ashamed of it,
for I know the one in whom I trust, and
I am sure that he is able to guard what
I have entrusted to him un l the day of
his return.
13 Hold on to the pa ern of right
teaching you learned from me. And
remember to live in the faith and love
that you have in Christ Jesus.
14 With the help of the Holy Spirit who
lives within us, carefully guard what has
been entrusted to you.2 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
15 As you know, all the Chris
4
ans who
came here from the province of Asia
have deserted me; even Phygelus and
Hermogenes are gone.
16 May the Lord show special kindness
to Onesiphorus and all his family because
he o en visited and encouraged me. He
was never ashamed of me because I was
in prison.
17 When he came to Rome, he searched
everywhere un l he found me.
18 May the Lord show him special
kindness on the day of Christ’s return.
And you know how much he helped me
at Ephesus.
1 Timothy, my dear son, be strong
with the special favor God gives you
in Christ Jesus.
2 You have heard me teach many things
that have been conﬁrmed by many
reliable witnesses. Teach these great
22 TIMOTHY 2
5
truths to trustworthy people who are
able to pass them on to others.
3 Endure suﬀering along with me, as a
good soldier of Christ Jesus.
4 And as Christ’s soldier, do not let
yourself become ed up in the aﬀairs of
this life, for then you cannot sa sfy the
one who has enlisted you in his army.
5 Follow the Lord’s rules for doing his
work, just as an athlete either follows
the rules or is disqualiﬁed and wins no
prize.
6 Hardworking farmers are the ﬁrst to
enjoy the fruit of their labor.
7 Think about what I am saying. The
Lord will give you understanding in all
these things.
8 Never forget that Jesus Christ was a
man born into King David’s family and
that he was raised from the dead. This is
the Good News I preach.2 TIMOTHY 2
6
9 And because I preach this Good News,
I am suﬀering and have been chained
like a criminal. But the word of God
cannot be chained.
10 I am willing to endure anything if it
will bring salva on and eternal glory in
Christ Jesus to those God has chosen.
11 This is a true saying: If we die with
him, we will also live with him.
12 If we endure hardship, we will reign
with him. If we deny him, he will deny
us.
13 If we are unfaithful, he remains
faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
14 Remind everyone of these things, and
command them in God’s name to stop
ﬁgh ng over words. Such arguments are
useless, and they can ruin those who
hear them.
15 Work hard so God can approve you.
Be a good worker, one who does not2 TIMOTHY 2
7
need to be ashamed and who correctly
explains the word of truth.
16 Avoid godless, foolish discussions
that lead to more and more ungodliness.
17 This kind of talk spreads like cancer.
Hymenaeus and Philetus are examples
of this.
18 They have le the path of truth,
preaching the lie that the resurrec on of
the dead has already occurred; and they
have undermined the faith of some.
19 But God’s truth stands ﬁrm like a
founda on stone with this inscrip on:
"The Lord knows those who are his,"
and "Those who claim they belong
to the Lord must turn away from all
wickedness."
20 In a wealthy home some utensils are
made of gold and silver, and some are
made of wood and clay. The expensive
utensils are used for special occasions,
and the cheap ones are for everyday use.2 TIMOTHY 2
8
21 If you keep yourself pure, you will be
a utensil God can use for his purpose.
Your life will be clean, and you will be
ready for the Master to use you for every
good work.
22 Run from anything that s mulates
youthful lust. Follow anything that
makes you want to do right. Pursue
faith and love and peace, and enjoy the
companionship of those who call on the
Lord with pure hearts.
23 Again I say, don’t get involved in
foolish, ignorant arguments that only
start ﬁghts.
24 The Lord’s servants must not quarrel
but must be kind to everyone. They
must be able to teach eﬀec vely and be
pa ent with diﬃcult people.
25 They should gently teach those who
oppose the truth. Perhaps God will
change those people’s hearts, and they
will believe the truth.2 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
9
26 Then they will come to their senses
and escape from the Devil’s trap. For
they have been held cap ve by him to
do whatever he wants.
1 You should also know this, Timothy,
that in the last days there will be
very diﬃcult mes.
2 For people will love only themselves
and their money. They will be boas ul
and proud, scoﬃng at God, disobedient
to their parents, and ungrateful. They
will consider nothing sacred.
3 They will be unloving and unforgiving;
they will slander others and have no
self–control; they will be cruel and have
no interest in what is good.
4 They will betray their friends, be
reckless, be puﬀed up with pride, and
love pleasure rather than God.
5 They will act as if they are religious,
but they will reject the power that could
32 TIMOTHY 3
10
make them godly. You must stay away
from people like that.
6 They are the kind who work their
way into people’s homes and win the
conﬁdence of vulnerable women who
are burdened with the guilt of sin and
controlled by many desires.
7 Such women are forever following
new teachings, but they never
understand the truth.
8 And these teachers ﬁght the truth just
as Jannes and Jambres fought against
Moses. Their minds are depraved, and
their faith is counterfeit.
9 But they won’t get away with this for
long. Someday everyone will recognize
what fools they are, just as happened
with Jannes and Jambres.
10 But you know what I teach, Timothy,
and how I live, and what my purpose in
life is. You know my faith and how long I2 TIMOTHY 3
11
have suﬀered. You know my love and my
pa ent endurance.
11 You know how much persecu on and
suﬀering I have endured. You know all
about how I was persecuted in An och,
Iconium, and Lystra––but the Lord
delivered me from all of it.
12 Yes, and everyone who wants to live
a godly life in Christ Jesus will suﬀer
persecu on.
13 But evil people and impostors will
ﬂourish. They will go on deceiving
others, and they themselves will be
deceived.
14 But you must remain faithful to the
things you have been taught. You know
they are true, for you know you can trust
those who taught you.
15 You have been taught the holy
Scriptures from childhood, and they
have given you the wisdom to receive2 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
12
the salva on that comes by trus ng in
Christ Jesus.
16 All Scripture is inspired by God and
is useful to teach us what is true and
to make us realize what is wrong in our
lives. It straightens us out and teaches us
to do what is right.
17 It is God’s way of preparing us in
every way, fully equipped for every good
thing God wants us to do.
1 And so I solemnly urge you before
God and before Christ Jesus––who
will someday judge the living and the
dead when he appears to set up his
Kingdom:
2 Preach the word of God. Be persistent,
whether the me is favorable or not.
Pa ently correct, rebuke, and encourage
your people with good teaching.
3 For a me is coming when people
will no longer listen to right teaching.
They will follow their own desires and
42 TIMOTHY 4
13
will look for teachers who will tell them
whatever they want to hear.
4 They will reject the truth and follow
strange myths.
5 But you should keep a clear mind
in every situa on. Don’t be afraid of
suﬀering for the Lord. Work at bringing
others to Christ. Complete the ministry
God has given you.
6 As for me, my life has already been
poured out as an oﬀering to God. The
me of my death is near.
7 I have fought a good ﬁght, I have
ﬁnished the race, and I have remained
faithful.
8 And now the prize awaits me––the
crown of righteousness that the Lord,
the righteous Judge, will give me on that
great day of his return. And the prize is
not just for me but for all who eagerly
look forward to his glorious return.
9 Please come as soon as you can.2 TIMOTHY 4
14
10 Demas has deserted me because he
loves the things of this life and has gone
to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to
Gala a, and Titus has gone to Dalma a.
11 Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark
with you when you come, for he will be
helpful to me.
12 I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
13 When you come, be sure to bring
the coat I le with Carpus at Troas.
Also bring my books, and especially my
papers.
14 Alexander the coppersmith has done
me much harm, but the Lord will judge
him for what he has done.
15 Be careful of him, for he fought
against everything we said.
16 The ﬁrst me I was brought before
the judge, no one was with me. Everyone
had abandoned me. I hope it will not be
counted against them.2 TIMOTHY 4
15
17 But the Lord stood with me and gave
me strength, that I might preach the
Good News in all its fullness for all the
Gen les to hear. And he saved me from
certain death.
18 Yes, and the Lord will deliver me from
every evil a ack and will bring me safely
to his heavenly Kingdom. To God be the
glory forever and ever. Amen.
19 Give my gree ngs to Priscilla and
Aquila and those living at the household
of Onesiphorus.
20 Erastus stayed at Corinth, and I le
Trophimus sick at Miletus.
21 Hurry so you can get here before
winter. Eubulus sends you gree ngs, and
so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the
brothers and sisters.
22 May the Lord be with your spirit.
Grace be with you all.Titus
1 This le
er is from Paul, a slave of
God and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
I have been sent to bring faith to those
God has chosen and to teach them to
know the truth that shows them how to
live godly lives.
2 This truth gives them the conﬁdence
of eternal life, which God promised them
before the world began––and he cannot
lie.
3 And now at the right me he has
revealed this Good News, and we
announce it to everyone. It is by the
command of God our Savior that I have
been trusted to do this work for him.
4 This le er is wri en to Titus, my true
child in the faith that we share. May God
1TITUS 1
2
the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior
give you grace and peace.
5 I le you on the island of Crete so
you could complete our work there
and appoint elders in each town as I
instructed you.
6 An elder must be well thought of for
his good life. He must be faithful to his
wife, and his children must be believers
who are not wild or rebellious.
7 An elder must live a blameless life
because he is God’s minister. He must
not be arrogant or quick–tempered; he
must not be a heavy drinker, violent, or
greedy for money.
8 He must enjoy having guests in his
home and must love all that is good. He
must live wisely and be fair. He must live
a devout and disciplined life.
9 He must have a strong and steadfast
belief in the trustworthy message he was
taught; then he will be able to encourageTITUS 1
3
others with right teaching and show
those who oppose it where they are
wrong.
10 For there are many who rebel against
right teaching; they engage in useless
talk and deceive people. This is especially
true of those who insist on circumcision
for salva on.
11 They must be silenced. By their
wrong teaching, they have already
turned whole families away from the
truth. Such teachers only want your
money.
12 One of their own men, a prophet
from Crete, has said about them, "The
people of Crete are all liars; they are
cruel animals and lazy glu ons."
13 This is true. So rebuke them as sternly
as necessary to make them strong in the
faith.TITUS 1 – 2
4
14 They must stop listening to Jewish
myths and the commands of people who
have turned their backs on the truth.
15 Everything is pure to those whose
hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to
those who are corrupt and unbelieving,
because their minds and consciences are
deﬁled.
16 Such people claim they know God,
but they deny him by the way they live.
They are despicable and disobedient,
worthless for doing anything good.
1 But as for you, promote the kind of
living that reﬂects right teaching.
2 Teach the older men to exercise
self–control, to be worthy of respect,
and to live wisely. They must have
strong faith and be ﬁlled with love and
pa ence.
3 Similarly, teach the older women
to live in a way that is appropriate for
someone serving the Lord. They must
2TITUS 2
5
not go around speaking evil of others
and must not be heavy drinkers. Instead,
they should teach others what is good.
4 These older women must train the
younger women to love their husbands
and their children,
5 to live wisely and be pure, to take care
of their homes, to do good, and to be
submissive to their husbands. Then they
will not bring shame on the word of God.
6 In the same way, encourage the young
men to live wisely in all they do.
7 And you yourself must be an example
to them by doing good deeds of every
kind. Let everything you do reﬂect
the integrity and seriousness of your
teaching.
8 Let your teaching be so correct that it
can’t be cri cized. Then those who want
to argue will be ashamed because they
won’t have anything bad to say about us.TITUS 2
6
9 Slaves must obey their masters and
do their best to please them. They must
not talk back
10 or steal, but they must show
themselves to be en rely trustworthy
and good. Then they will make the
teaching about God our Savior a rac ve
in every way.
11 For the grace of God has been
revealed, bringing salva on to all
people.
12 And we are instructed to turn from
godless living and sinful pleasures.
We should live in this evil world with
self–control, right conduct, and devo on
to God,
13 while we look forward to that
wonderful event when the glory of our
great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, will
be revealed.
14 He gave his life to free us from every
kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make usTITUS 2 – 3
7
his very own people, totally commi ed
to doing what is right.
15 You must teach these things and
encourage your people to do them,
correc ng them when necessary. You
have the authority to do this, so don’t
let anyone ignore you or disregard what
you say.
1 Remind your people to submit to
the government and its oﬃcers.
They should be obedient, always ready
to do what is good.
2 They must not speak evil of anyone,
and they must avoid quarreling. Instead,
they should be gentle and show true
humility to everyone.
3 Once we, too, were foolish and
disobedient. We were misled by others
and became slaves to many wicked
desires and evil pleasures. Our lives were
full of evil and envy. We hated others,
and they hated us.
3TITUS 3
8
4 But then God our Savior showed us
his kindness and love.
5 He saved us, not because of the good
things we did, but because of his mercy.
He washed away our sins and gave us a
new life through the Holy Spirit.
6 He generously poured out the Spirit
upon us because of what Jesus Christ
our Savior did.
7 He declared us not guilty because of
his great kindness. And now we know
that we will inherit eternal life.
8 These things I have told you are all
true. I want you to insist on them so
that everyone who trusts in God will be
careful to do good deeds all the me.
These things are good and beneﬁcial for
everyone.
9 Do not get involved in foolish
discussions about spiritual pedigrees or
in quarrels and ﬁghts about obedienceTITUS 3
9
to Jewish laws. These kinds of things are
useless and a waste of me.
10 If anyone is causing divisions among
you, give a ﬁrst and second warning.
A er that, have nothing more to do with
that person.
11 For people like that have turned
away from the truth. They are sinning,
and they condemn themselves.
12 I am planning to send either Artemas
or Tychicus to you. As soon as one of
them arrives, do your best to meet me at
Nicopolis as quickly as you can, for I have
decided to stay there for the winter.
13 Do everything you can to help Zenas
the lawyer and Apollos with their trip.
See that they are given everything they
need.
14 For our people should not have
unproduc ve lives. They must learn to
do good by helping others who have
urgent needs.TITUS 3
15 Everybody here sends gree

Please give my gree ngs to all of the
believers who love us. May God’s grace
be with you all.Philemon
1 This le

for preaching the Good News about
Christ Jesus, and from our brother
Timothy. It is wri en to Philemon, our
much loved co–worker,
2 and to our sister Apphia and to
Archippus, a fellow soldier of the cross. I
am also wri ng to the church that meets
in your house.
3 May God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
4 I always thank God when I pray for
you, Philemon,
5 because I keep hearing of your trust
in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of
God’s people.
6 You are generous because of your
faith. And I am praying that you will
1PHILEMON 1
2
really put your generosity to work,
for in so doing you will come to an
understanding of all the good things we
can do for Christ.
7 I myself have gained much joy and
comfort from your love, my brother,
because your kindness has so o en
refreshed the hearts of God’s people.
8 That is why I am boldly asking a favor
of you. I could demand it in the name
of Christ because it is the right thing for
you to do,
9 but because of our love, I prefer just
to ask you. So take this as a request from
your friend Paul, an old man, now in
prison for the sake of Christ Jesus.
10 My plea is that you show kindness to
Onesimus. I think of him as my own son
because he became a believer as a result
of my ministry here in prison.PHILEMON 1
3
11 Onesimus hasn’t been of much use
to you in the past, but now he is very
useful to both of us.
12 I am sending him back to you, and
with him comes my own heart.
13 I really wanted to keep him here
with me while I am in these chains for
preaching the Good News, and he would
have helped me on your behalf.
14 But I didn’t want to do anything
without your consent. And I didn’t want
you to help because you were forced to
do it but because you wanted to.
15 Perhaps you could think of it this
way: Onesimus ran away for a li le while
so you could have him back forever.
16 He is no longer just a slave; he is a
beloved brother, especially to me. Now
he will mean much more to you, both as
a slave and as a brother in the Lord.PHILEMON 1
4
17 So if you consider me your partner,
give him the same welcome you would
give me if I were coming.
18 If he has harmed you in any way or
stolen anything from you, charge me for
it.
19 I, Paul, write this in my own
handwri ng: "I will repay it." And I won’t
men on that you owe me your very
soul!
20 Yes, dear brother, please do me this
favor for the Lord’s sake. Give me this
encouragement in Christ.
21 I am conﬁdent as I write this le er
that you will do what I ask and even
more!
22 Please keep a guest room ready for
me, for I am hoping that God will answer
your prayers and let me return to you
soon.

24 So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and
Luke, my co–workers.
25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit.Hebrews
1 Long ago God spoke many
mes
and in many ways to our ancestors
through the prophets.
2 But now in these ﬁnal days, he has
spoken to us through his Son. God
promised everything to the Son as an
inheritance, and through the Son he
made the universe and everything in it.
3 The Son reﬂects God’s own glory, and
everything about him represents God
exactly. He sustains the universe by the
mighty power of his command. A er
he died to cleanse us from the stain of
sin, he sat down in the place of honor
at the right hand of the majes c God of
heaven.
4 This shows that God’s Son is far
greater than the angels, just as the name
1HEBREWS 1
2
God gave him is far greater than their
names.
5 For God never said to any angel what
he said to Jesus: "You are my Son. Today
I have become your Father." And again
God said, "I will be his Father, and he will
be my Son."
6 And then, when he presented his
honored Son to the world, God said, "Let
all the angels of God worship him."
7 God calls his angels "messengers
swi as the wind, and servants made of
ﬂaming ﬁre."
8 But to his Son he says, "Your throne, O
God, endures forever and ever. Your royal
power is expressed in righteousness.
9 You love what is right and hate what
is wrong. Therefore God, your God, has
anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy
on you more than on anyone else."HEBREWS 1 – 2
3
10 And, "Lord, in the beginning you laid
the founda on of the earth, and the
heavens are the work of your hands.
11 Even they will perish, but you remain
forever. They will wear out like old
clothing.
12 You will roll them up like an old coat.
They will fade away like old clothing. But
you are always the same; you will never
grow old."
13 And God never said to an angel, as
he did to his Son, "Sit in honor at my
right hand un l I humble your enemies,
making them a footstool under your
feet."
14 But angels are only servants. They
are spirits sent from God to care for
those who will receive salva on.
1 So we must listen very carefully to
the truth we have heard, or we may
dri away from it.
2HEBREWS 2
4
2 The message God delivered through
angels has always proved true, and the
people were punished for every viola on
of the law and every act of disobedience.
3 What makes us think that we can
escape if we are indiﬀerent to this great
salva on that was announced by the
Lord Jesus himself? It was passed on to
us by those who heard him speak,
4 and God veriﬁed the message by
signs and wonders and various miracles
and by giving gi s of the Holy Spirit
whenever he chose to do so.
5 And furthermore, the future world we
are talking about will not be controlled
by angels.
6 For somewhere in the Scriptures it
says, "What is man that you should think
of him, and the son of man that you
should care for him?HEBREWS 2
7 For a li
5
le while you made him lower
than the angels, and you crowned him
with glory and honor.
8 You gave him authority over all
things." Now when it says "all things," it
means nothing is le out. But we have
not yet seen all of this happen.
9 What we do see is Jesus, who "for a
li le while was made lower than the
angels" and now is "crowned with glory
and honor" because he suﬀered death
for us. Yes, by God’s grace, Jesus tasted
death for everyone in all the world.
10 And it was only right that God––
who made everything and for whom
everything was made––should bring
his many children into glory. Through
the suﬀering of Jesus, God made him a
perfect leader, one ﬁt to bring them into
their salva on.
11 So now Jesus and the ones he makes
holy have the same Father. That is whyHEBREWS 2
6
Jesus is not ashamed to call them his
brothers and sisters.
12 For he said to God, "I will declare the
wonder of your name to my brothers
and sisters. I will praise you among all
your people."
13 He also said, "I will put my trust in
him." And in the same context he said,
"Here I am––together with the children
God has given me."
14 Because God’s children are human
beings––made of ﬂesh and blood––Jesus
also became ﬂesh and blood by being
born in human form. For only as a
human being could he die, and only by
dying could he break the power of the
Devil, who had the power of death.
15 Only in this way could he deliver
those who have lived all their lives as
slaves to the fear of dying.HEBREWS 2 – 3
7
16 We all know that Jesus came to help
the descendants of Abraham, not to help
the angels.
17 Therefore, it was necessary for Jesus
to be in every respect like us, his brothers
and sisters, so that he could be our
merciful and faithful High Priest before
God. He then could oﬀer a sacriﬁce that
would take away the sins of the people.
18 Since he himself has gone through
suﬀering and tempta on, he is able to
help us when we are being tempted.
1 And so, dear brothers and sisters
who belong to God and are bound
for heaven, think about this Jesus whom
we declare to be God’s Messenger and
High Priest.
2 For he was faithful to God, who
appointed him, just as Moses served
faithfully and was entrusted with God’s
en re house.
3HEBREWS 3
8
3 But Jesus deserves far more glory
than Moses, just as a person who builds
a ﬁne house deserves more praise than
the house itself.
4 For every house has a builder, but God
is the one who made everything.
5 Moses was certainly faithful in God’s
house, but only as a servant. His work
was an illustra on of the truths God
would reveal later.
6 But Christ, the faithful Son, was in
charge of the en re household. And we
are God’s household, if we keep up our
courage and remain conﬁdent in our
hope in Christ.
7 That is why the Holy Spirit says, "Today
you must listen to his voice.
8 Don’t harden your hearts against
him as Israel did when they rebelled,
when they tested God’s pa ence in the
wilderness.HEBREWS 3
9
9 There your ancestors tried my
pa ence, even though they saw my
miracles for forty years.
10 So I was angry with them, and I said,
‘Their hearts always turn away from me.
They refuse to do what I tell them.’
11 So in my anger I made a vow: ‘They
will never enter my place of rest.’"
12 Be careful then, dear brothers and
sisters. Make sure that your own hearts
are not evil and unbelieving, turning you
away from the living God.
13 You must warn each other every day,
as long as it is called "today," so that
none of you will be deceived by sin and
hardened against God.
14 For if we are faithful to the end,
trus ng God just as ﬁrmly as when we
ﬁrst believed, we will share in all that
belongs to Christ.
15 But never forget the warning: "Today
you must listen to his voice. Don’tHEBREWS 3 – 4
10
harden your hearts against him as Israel
did when they rebelled."
16 And who were those people who
rebelled against God, even though they
heard his voice? Weren’t they the ones
Moses led out of Egypt?
17 And who made God angry for forty
years? Wasn’t it the people who sinned,
whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
18 And to whom was God speaking
when he vowed that they would never
enter his place of rest? He was speaking
to those who disobeyed him.
19 So we see that they were not
allowed to enter his rest because of their
unbelief.
1 God’s promise of entering his place
of rest s ll stands, so we ought to
tremble with fear that some of you
might fail to get there.
2 For this Good News––that God has
prepared a place of rest––has been
4HEBREWS 4
11
announced to us just as it was to them.
But it did them no good because they
didn’t believe what God told them.
3 For only we who believe can enter his
place of rest. As for those who didn’t
believe, God said, "In my anger I made a
vow: ‘They will never enter my place of
rest,’" even though his place of rest has
been ready since he made the world.
4 We know it is ready because the
Scriptures men on the seventh day,
saying, "On the seventh day God rested
from all his work."
5 But in the other passage God said,
"They will never enter my place of rest."
6 So God’s rest is there for people to
enter. But those who formerly heard the
Good News failed to enter because they
disobeyed God.
7 So God set another me for entering
his place of rest, and that me is today.
God announced this through David aHEBREWS 4
12
long me later in the words already
quoted: "Today you must listen to his
voice. Don’t harden your hearts against
him."
8 This new place of rest was not the
land of Canaan, where Joshua led them.
If it had been, God would not have
spoken later about another day of rest.
9 So there is a special rest s ll wai ng
for the people of God.
10 For all who enter into God’s rest will
ﬁnd rest from their labors, just as God
rested a er crea ng the world.
11 Let us do our best to enter that place
of rest. For anyone who disobeys God,
as the people of Israel did, will fall.
12 For the word of God is full of living
power. It is sharper than the sharpest
knife, cu ng deep into our innermost
thoughts and desires. It exposes us for
what we really are.HEBREWS 4 – 5
13 Nothing in all crea
13
on can hide from
him. Everything is naked and exposed
before his eyes. This is the God to whom
we must explain all that we have done.
14 That is why we have a great High
Priest who has gone to heaven, Jesus the
Son of God. Let us cling to him and never
stop trus ng him.
15 This High Priest of ours understands
our weaknesses, for he faced all of the
same tempta ons we do, yet he did not
sin.
16 So let us come boldly to the throne of
our gracious God. There we will receive
his mercy, and we will ﬁnd grace to help
us when we need it.
1 Now a high priest is a man chosen
to represent other human beings
in their dealings with God. He presents
their gi s to God and oﬀers their
sacriﬁces for sins.
5HEBREWS 5
14
2 And because he is human, he is able
to deal gently with the people, though
they are ignorant and wayward. For he
is subject to the same weaknesses they
have.
3 That is why he has to oﬀer sacriﬁces,
both for their sins and for his own sins.
4 And no one can become a high priest
simply because he wants such an honor.
He has to be called by God for this work,
just as Aaron was.
5 That is why Christ did not exalt himself
to become High Priest. No, he was
chosen by God, who said to him, "You
are my Son. Today I have become your
Father."
6 And in another passage God said to
him, "You are a priest forever in the line
of Melchizedek."
7 While Jesus was here on earth, he
oﬀered prayers and pleadings, with a
loud cry and tears, to the one who couldHEBREWS 5
15
deliver him out of death. And God heard
his prayers because of his reverence for
God.
8 So even though Jesus was God’s Son,
he learned obedience from the things he
suﬀered.
9 In this way, God qualiﬁed him as a
perfect High Priest, and he became the
source of eternal salva on for all those
who obey him.
10 And God designated him to be a High
Priest in the line of Melchizedek.
11 There is so much more we would
like to say about this. But you don’t
seem to listen, so it’s hard to make you
understand.
12 You have been Chris ans a long
me now, and you ought to be teaching
others. Instead, you need someone
to teach you again the basic things
a beginner must learn about theHEBREWS 5 – 6
16
Scriptures. You are like babies who drink
only milk and cannot eat solid food.
13 And a person who is living on milk
isn’t very far along in the Chris an life
and doesn’t know much about doing
what is right.
14 Solid food is for those who are
mature, who have trained themselves to
recognize the diﬀerence between right
and wrong and then do what is right.
1 So let us stop going over the basics
of Chris anity again and again. Let us
go on instead and become mature in our
understanding. Surely we don’t need to
start all over again with the importance
of turning away from evil deeds and
placing our faith in God.
2 You don’t need further instruc on
about bap sms, the laying on of hands,
the resurrec on of the dead, and eternal
judgment.
6HEBREWS 6
17
3 And so, God willing, we will move
forward to further understanding.
4 For it is impossible to restore
to repentance those who were
once enlightened––those who have
experienced the good things of heaven
and shared in the Holy Spirit,
5 who have tasted the goodness of the
word of God and the power of the age to
come––
6 and who then turn away from God.
It is impossible to bring such people
to repentance again because they are
nailing the Son of God to the cross again
by rejec ng him, holding him up to
public shame.
7 When the ground soaks up the rain
that falls on it and bears a good crop for
the farmer, it has the blessing of God.
8 But if a ﬁeld bears thistles and thorns,
it is useless. The farmer will condemn
that ﬁeld and burn it.HEBREWS 6
18
9 Dear friends, even though we are
talking like this, we really don’t believe
that it applies to you. We are conﬁdent
that you are meant for be er things,
things that come with salva on.
10 For God is not unfair. He will not
forget how hard you have worked for
him and how you have shown your love
to him by caring for other Chris ans, as
you s ll do.
11 Our great desire is that you will keep
right on loving others as long as life lasts,
in order to make certain that what you
hope for will come true.
12 Then you will not become spiritually
dull and indiﬀerent. Instead, you will
follow the example of those who are
going to inherit God’s promises because
of their faith and pa ence.
13 For example, there was God’s
promise to Abraham. Since there wasHEBREWS 6
19
no one greater to swear by, God took an
oath in his own name, saying:
14 "I will certainly bless you richly, and
I will mul ply your descendants into
countless millions."
15 Then Abraham waited pa ently, and
he received what God had promised.
16 When people take an oath, they call
on someone greater than themselves
to hold them to it. And without any
ques on that oath is binding.
17 God also bound himself with an oath,
so that those who received the promise
could be perfectly sure that he would
never change his mind.
18 So God has given us both his promise
and his oath. These two things are
unchangeable because it is impossible
for God to lie. Therefore, we who have
ﬂed to him for refuge can take new
courage, for we can hold on to his
promise with conﬁdence.HEBREWS 6 – 7
20
19 This conﬁdence is like a strong and
trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads
us through the curtain of heaven into
God’s inner sanctuary.
20 Jesus has already gone in there for
us. He has become our eternal High
Priest in the line of Melchizedek.
1 This Melchizedek was king of the
city of Salem and also a priest of
God Most High. When Abraham was
returning home a er winning a great
ba le against many kings, Melchizedek
met him and blessed him.
2 Then Abraham took a tenth of all he
had won in the ba le and gave it to
Melchizedek. His name means "king
of jus ce." He is also "king of peace"
because Salem means "peace."
3 There is no record of his father or
mother or any of his ancestors––no
beginning or end to his life. He remains
7HEBREWS 7
21
a priest forever, resembling the Son of
God.
4 Consider then how great this
Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the
great patriarch of Israel, recognized how
great Melchizedek was by giving him a
tenth of what he had taken in ba le.
5 Now the priests, who are descendants
of Levi, are commanded in the law of
Moses to collect a the from all the
people, even though they are their own
rela ves.
6 But Melchizedek, who was not even
related to Levi, collected a tenth from
Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a
blessing upon Abraham, the one who
had already received the promises of
God.
7 And without ques on, the person
who has the power to bless is always
greater than the person who is blessed.HEBREWS 7
8 In the case of Jewish priests,
22
thes
are paid to men who will die. But
Melchizedek is greater than they are,
because we are told that he lives on.
9 In addi on, we might even say that
Levi’s descendants, the ones who collect
the the, paid a the to Melchizedek
through their ancestor Abraham.
10 For although Levi wasn’t born yet,
the seed from which he came was in
Abraham’s loins when Melchizedek
collected the the from him.
11 And ﬁnally, if the priesthood of Levi
could have achieved God’s purposes––
and it was that priesthood on which the
law was based––why did God need to
send a diﬀerent priest from the line of
Melchizedek, instead of from the line of
Levi and Aaron?
12 And when the priesthood is changed,
the law must also be changed to permit
it.HEBREWS 7
23
13 For the one we are talking about
belongs to a diﬀerent tribe, whose
members do not serve at the altar.
14 What I mean is, our Lord came from
the tribe of Judah, and Moses never
men oned Judah in connec on with the
priesthood.
15 The change in God’s law is even more
evident from the fact that a diﬀerent
priest, who is like Melchizedek, has now
come.
16 He became a priest, not by mee ng
the old requirement of belonging to the
tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life
that cannot be destroyed.
17 And the psalmist pointed this out
when he said of Christ, "You are a priest
forever in the line of Melchizedek."
18 Yes, the old requirement about the
priesthood was set aside because it was
weak and useless.HEBREWS 7
24
19 For the law made nothing perfect,
and now a be er hope has taken its
place. And that is how we draw near to
God.
20 God took an oath that Christ would
always be a priest, but he never did this
for any other priest.
21 Only to Jesus did he say, "The Lord
has taken an oath and will not break his
vow: ‘You are a priest forever.’"
22 Because of God’s oath, it is Jesus
who guarantees the eﬀec veness of this
be er covenant.
23 Another diﬀerence is that there were
many priests under the old system.
When one priest died, another had to
take his place.
24 But Jesus remains a priest forever;
his priesthood will never end.
25 Therefore he is able, once and
forever, to save everyone who comesHEBREWS 7 – 8
25
to God through him. He lives forever to
plead with God on their behalf.
26 He is the kind of high priest we
need because he is holy and blameless,
unstained by sin. He has now been set
apart from sinners, and he has been
given the highest place of honor in
heaven.
27 He does not need to oﬀer sacriﬁces
every day like the other high priests.
They did this for their own sins ﬁrst and
then for the sins of the people. But Jesus
did this once for all when he sacriﬁced
himself on the cross.
28 Those who were high priests under
the law of Moses were limited by human
weakness. But a er the law was given,
God appointed his Son with an oath, and
his Son has been made perfect forever.
1 Here is the main point: Our High
Priest sat down in the place of
8HEBREWS 8
26
highest honor in heaven, at God’s right
hand.
2 There he ministers in the sacred tent,
the true place of worship that was built
by the Lord and not by human hands.
3 And since every high priest is required
to oﬀer gi s and sacriﬁces, our High
Priest must make an oﬀering, too.
4 If he were here on earth, he would
not even be a priest, since there already
are priests who oﬀer the gi s required
by the law of Moses.
5 They serve in a place of worship that
is only a copy, a shadow of the real one
in heaven. For when Moses was ge ng
ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave
him this warning: "Be sure that you make
everything according to the design I have
shown you here on the mountain."
6 But our High Priest has been given
a ministry that is far superior to the
ministry of those who serve underHEBREWS 8
27
the old laws, for he is the one who
guarantees for us a be er covenant with
God, based on be er promises.
7 If the ﬁrst covenant had been faultless,
there would have been no need for a
second covenant to replace it.
8 But God himself found fault with the
old one when he said: "The day will
come, says the Lord, when I will make a
new covenant with the people of Israel
and Judah.
9 This covenant will not be like the one
I made with their ancestors when I took
them by the hand and led them out of
the land of Egypt. They did not remain
faithful to my covenant, so I turned my
back on them, says the Lord.
10 But this is the new covenant I will
make with the people of Israel on that
day, says the Lord: I will put my laws
in their minds so they will understand
them, and I will write them on theirHEBREWS 8 – 9
28
hearts so they will obey them. I will be
their God, and they will be my people.
11 And they will not need to teach their
neighbors, nor will they need to teach
their family, saying, ‘You should know
the Lord.’ For everyone, from the least
to the greatest, will already know me.
12 And I will forgive their wrongdoings,
and I will never again remember their
sins."
13 When God speaks of a new covenant,
it means he has made the ﬁrst one
obsolete. It is now out of date and ready
to be put aside.
1 Now in that ﬁrst covenant
between God and Israel, there were
regula ons for worship and a sacred tent
here on earth.
2 There were two rooms in this tent. In
the ﬁrst room were a lampstand, a table,
and loaves of holy bread on the table.
This was called the Holy Place.
9HEBREWS 9
29
3 Then there was a curtain, and behind
the curtain was the second room called
the Most Holy Place.
4 In that room were a gold incense altar
and a wooden chest called the Ark of
the Covenant, which was covered with
gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a
gold jar containing some manna, Aaron’s
staﬀ that sprouted leaves, and the stone
tablets of the covenant with the Ten
Commandments wri en on them.
5 The glorious cherubim were above the
Ark. Their wings were stretched out over
the Ark’s cover, the place of atonement.
But we cannot explain all of these things
now.
6 When these things were all in place,
the priests went in and out of the ﬁrst
room regularly as they performed their
religious du es.
7 But only the high priest goes into the
Most Holy Place, and only once a year,HEBREWS 9
30
and always with blood, which he oﬀers
to God to cover his own sins and the sins
the people have commi ed in ignorance.
8 By these regula ons the Holy Spirit
revealed that the Most Holy Place was
not open to the people as long as the
ﬁrst room and the en re system it
represents were s ll in use.
9 This is an illustra on poin ng to the
present me. For the gi s and sacriﬁces
that the priests oﬀer are not able to
cleanse the consciences of the people
who bring them.
10 For that old system deals only with
food and drink and ritual washing––
external regula ons that are in eﬀect
only un l their limita ons can be
corrected.
11 So Christ has now become the High
Priest over all the good things that
have come. He has entered that great,
perfect sanctuary in heaven, not madeHEBREWS 9
31
by human hands and not part of this
created world.
12 Once for all me he took blood
into that Most Holy Place, but not the
blood of goats and calves. He took his
own blood, and with it he secured our
salva on forever.
13 Under the old system, the blood of
goats and bulls and the ashes of a young
cow could cleanse people’s bodies from
ritual deﬁlement.
14 Just think how much more the blood
of Christ will purify our hearts from
deeds that lead to death so that we can
worship the living God. For by the power
of the eternal Spirit, Christ oﬀered
himself to God as a perfect sacriﬁce for
our sins.
15 That is why he is the one who
mediates the new covenant between
God and people, so that all who
are invited can receive the eternalHEBREWS 9
32
inheritance God has promised them. For
Christ died to set them free from the
penalty of the sins they had commi ed
under that ﬁrst covenant.
16 Now when someone dies and leaves
a will, no one gets anything un l it is
proved that the person who wrote the
will is dead.
17 The will goes into eﬀect only a er
the death of the person who wrote it.
While the person is s ll alive, no one
can use the will to get any of the things
promised to them.
18 That is why blood was required under
the ﬁrst covenant as a proof of death.
19 For a er Moses had given the people
all of God’s laws, he took the blood of
calves and goats, along with water, and
sprinkled both the book of God’s laws
and all the people, using branches of
hyssop bushes and scarlet wool.HEBREWS 9
33
20 Then he said, "This blood conﬁrms
the covenant God has made with you."
21 And in the same way, he sprinkled
blood on the sacred tent and on
everything used for worship.
22 In fact, we can say that according
to the law of Moses, nearly everything
was puriﬁed by sprinkling with blood.
Without the shedding of blood, there is
no forgiveness of sins.
23 That is why the earthly tent and
everything in it––which were copies of
things in heaven––had to be puriﬁed
by the blood of animals. But the real
things in heaven had to be puriﬁed with
far be er sacriﬁces than the blood of
animals.
24 For Christ has entered into heaven
itself to appear now before God as our
Advocate. He did not go into the earthly
place of worship, for that was merely a
copy of the real Temple in heaven.HEBREWS 9 – 10
34
25 Nor did he enter heaven to oﬀer
himself again and again, like the earthly
high priest who enters the Most Holy
Place year a er year to oﬀer the blood
of an animal.
26 If that had been necessary, he would
have had to die again and again, ever
since the world began. But no! He came
once for all me, at the end of the age,
to remove the power of sin forever by
his sacriﬁcial death for us.
27 And just as it is des ned that each
person dies only once and a er that
comes judgment,
28 so also Christ died only once as a
sacriﬁce to take away the sins of many
people. He will come again but not to
deal with our sins again. This me he
will bring salva on to all those who are
eagerly wai ng for him.
1 The old system in the law of
Moses was only a shadow of the
10HEBREWS 10
35
things to come, not the reality of the
good things Christ has done for us. The
sacriﬁces under the old system were
repeated again and again, year a er
year, but they were never able to provide
perfect cleansing for those who came to
worship.
2 If they could have provided perfect
cleansing, the sacriﬁces would have
stopped, for the worshipers would have
been puriﬁed once for all me, and their
feelings of guilt would have disappeared.
3 But just the opposite happened.
Those yearly sacriﬁces reminded them
of their sins year a er year.
4 For it is not possible for the blood of
bulls and goats to take away sins.
5 That is why Christ, when he came
into the world, said, "You did not want
animal sacriﬁces and grain oﬀerings. But
you have given me a body so that I may
obey you.HEBREWS 10
36
6 No, you were not pleased with
animals burned on the altar or with
other oﬀerings for sin.
7 Then I said, ‘Look, I have come to do
your will, O God––just as it is wri en
about me in the Scriptures.’"
8 Christ said, "You did not want animal
sacriﬁces or grain oﬀerings or animals
burned on the altar or other oﬀerings
for sin, nor were you pleased with them"
(though they are required by the law of
Moses).
9 Then he added, "Look, I have come
to do your will." He cancels the ﬁrst
covenant in order to establish the
second.
10 And what God wants is for us to be
made holy by the sacriﬁce of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all me.
11 Under the old covenant, the priest
stands before the altar day a er day,HEBREWS 10
37
oﬀering sacriﬁces that can never take
away sins.
12 But our High Priest oﬀered himself to
God as one sacriﬁce for sins, good for all
me. Then he sat down at the place of
highest honor at God’s right hand.
13 There he waits un l his enemies are
humbled as a footstool under his feet.
14 For by that one oﬀering he perfected
forever all those whom he is making
holy.
15 And the Holy Spirit also tes ﬁes that
this is so. First he says,
16 "This is the new covenant I will make
with my people on that day, says the
Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts
so they will understand them, and I will
write them on their minds so they will
obey them."
17 Then he adds, "I will never again
remember their sins and lawless deeds."HEBREWS 10
38
18 Now when sins have been forgiven,
there is no need to oﬀer any more
sacriﬁces.
19 And so, dear brothers and sisters,
we can boldly enter heaven’s Most Holy
Place because of the blood of Jesus.
20 This is the new, life–giving way that
Christ has opened up for us through the
sacred curtain, by means of his death for
us.
21 And since we have a great High Priest
who rules over God’s people,
22 let us go right into the presence
of God, with true hearts fully trus ng
him. For our evil consciences have been
sprinkled with Christ’s blood to make us
clean, and our bodies have been washed
with pure water.
23 Without wavering, let us hold ghtly
to the hope we say we have, for God can
be trusted to keep his promise.HEBREWS 10
39
24 Think of ways to encourage one
another to outbursts of love and good
deeds.
25 And let us not neglect our mee ng
together, as some people do, but
encourage and warn each other,
especially now that the day of his coming
back again is drawing near.
26 Dear friends, if we deliberately
con nue sinning a er we have received
a full knowledge of the truth, there is no
other sacriﬁce that will cover these sins.
27 There will be nothing to look forward
to but the terrible expecta on of God’s
judgment and the raging ﬁre that will
consume his enemies.
28 Anyone who refused to obey the
law of Moses was put to death without
mercy on the tes mony of two or three
witnesses.
29 Think how much more terrible the
punishment will be for those who haveHEBREWS 10
40
trampled on the Son of God and have
treated the blood of the covenant as
if it were common and unholy. Such
people have insulted and enraged the
Holy Spirit who brings God’s mercy to his
people.
30 For we know the one who said, "I will
take vengeance. I will repay those who
deserve it." He also said, "The Lord will
judge his own people."
31 It is a terrible thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.
32 Don’t ever forget those early days
when you ﬁrst learned about Christ.
Remember how you remained faithful
even though it meant terrible suﬀering.
33 Some mes you were exposed to
public ridicule and were beaten, and
some mes you helped others who were
suﬀering the same things.
34 You suﬀered along with those
who were thrown into jail. When allHEBREWS 10 – 11
41
you owned was taken from you, you
accepted it with joy. You knew you had
be er things wai ng for you in eternity.
35 Do not throw away this conﬁdent
trust in the Lord, no ma er what
happens. Remember the great reward it
brings you!
36 Pa ent endurance is what you need
now, so you will con nue to do God’s
will. Then you will receive all that he has
promised.
37 "For in just a li le while, the Coming
One will come and not delay.
38 And a righteous person will live by
faith. But I will have no pleasure in
anyone who turns away."
39 But we are not like those who turn
their backs on God and seal their fate.
We have faith that assures our salva on.
1 What is faith? It is the conﬁdent
assurance that what we hope for
11HEBREWS 11
42
is going to happen. It is the evidence of
things we cannot yet see.
2 God gave his approval to people in
days of old because of their faith.
3 By faith we understand that the en re
universe was formed at God’s command,
that what we now see did not come
from anything that can be seen.
4 It was by faith that Abel brought a
more acceptable oﬀering to God than
Cain did. God accepted Abel’s oﬀering
to show that he was a righteous man.
And although Abel is long dead, he s ll
speaks to us because of his faith.
5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken
up to heaven without dying––"suddenly
he disappeared because God took him."
But before he was taken up, he was
approved as pleasing to God.
6 So, you see, it is impossible to please
God without faith. Anyone who wants to
come to him must believe that there isHEBREWS 11
43
a God and that he rewards those who
sincerely seek him.
7 It was by faith that Noah built an ark
to save his family from the ﬂood. He
obeyed God, who warned him about
something that had never happened
before. By his faith he condemned the
rest of the world and was made right in
God’s sight.
8 It was by faith that Abraham obeyed
when God called him to leave home and
go to another land that God would give
him as his inheritance. He went without
knowing where he was going.
9 And even when he reached the land
God promised him, he lived there by
faith––for he was like a foreigner, living
in a tent. And so did Isaac and Jacob, to
whom God gave the same promise.
10 Abraham did this because he was
conﬁdently looking forward to a cityHEBREWS 11
44
with eternal founda ons, a city designed
and built by God.
11 It was by faith that Sarah together
with Abraham was able to have a child,
even though they were too old and
Sarah was barren. Abraham believed
that God would keep his promise.
12 And so a whole na on came from
this one man, Abraham, who was too
old to have any children––a na on with
so many people that, like the stars of the
sky and the sand on the seashore, there
is no way to count them.
13 All these faithful ones died without
receiving what God had promised them,
but they saw it all from a distance and
welcomed the promises of God. They
agreed that they were no more than
foreigners and nomads here on earth.
14 And obviously people who talk like
that are looking forward to a country
they can call their own.HEBREWS 11
45
15 If they had meant the country they
came from, they would have found a
way to go back.
16 But they were looking for a be er
place, a heavenly homeland. That is why
God is not ashamed to be called their
God, for he has prepared a heavenly city
for them.
17 It was by faith that Abraham oﬀered
Isaac as a sacriﬁce when God was tes ng
him. Abraham, who had received God’s
promises, was ready to sacriﬁce his only
son, Isaac,
18 though God had promised him,
"Isaac is the son through whom your
descendants will be counted."
19 Abraham assumed that if Isaac died,
God was able to bring him back to life
again. And in a sense, Abraham did
receive his son back from the dead.
20 It was by faith that Isaac blessed
his two sons, Jacob and Esau. He hadHEBREWS 11
46
conﬁdence in what God was going to do
in the future.
21 It was by faith that Jacob, when
he was old and dying, blessed each of
Joseph’s sons and bowed in worship as
he leaned on his staﬀ.
22 And it was by faith that Joseph, when
he was about to die, conﬁdently spoke
of God’s bringing the people of Israel
out of Egypt. He was so sure of it that
he commanded them to carry his bones
with them when they le !
23 It was by faith that Moses’ parents
hid him for three months. They saw that
God had given them an unusual child,
and they were not afraid of what the
king might do.
24 It was by faith that Moses, when he
grew up, refused to be treated as the
son of Pharaoh’s daughter.HEBREWS 11
47
25 He chose to share the oppression of
God’s people instead of enjoying the
ﬂee ng pleasures of sin.
26 He thought it was be er to suﬀer for
the sake of the Messiah than to own the
treasures of Egypt, for he was looking
ahead to the great reward that God
would give him.
27 It was by faith that Moses le the
land of Egypt. He was not afraid of the
king. Moses kept right on going because
he kept his eyes on the one who is
invisible.
28 It was by faith that Moses
commanded the people of Israel to keep
the Passover and to sprinkle blood on
the doorposts so that the angel of death
would not kill their ﬁrstborn sons.
29 It was by faith that the people of
Israel went right through the Red Sea
as though they were on dry ground. ButHEBREWS 11
48
when the Egyp ans followed, they were
all drowned.
30 It was by faith that the people of
Israel marched around Jericho seven
days, and the walls came crashing down.
31 It was by faith that Rahab the
pros tute did not die with all the others
in her city who refused to obey God. For
she had given a friendly welcome to the
spies.
32 Well, how much more do I need to
say? It would take too long to recount
the stories of the faith of Gideon, Barak,
Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and
all the prophets.
33 By faith these people overthrew
kingdoms, ruled with jus ce, and
received what God had promised them.
They shut the mouths of lions,
34 quenched the ﬂames of ﬁre, and
escaped death by the edge of the sword.
Their weakness was turned to strength.HEBREWS 11
49
They became strong in ba le and put
whole armies to ﬂight.
35 Women received their loved ones
back again from death. But others
trusted God and were tortured,
preferring to die rather than turn from
God and be free. They placed their hope
in the resurrec on to a be er life.
36 Some were mocked, and their backs
were cut open with whips. Others were
chained in dungeons.
37 Some died by stoning, and some
were sawed in half; others were killed
with the sword. Some went about in
skins of sheep and goats, hungry and
oppressed and mistreated.
38 They were too good for this world.
They wandered over deserts and
mountains, hiding in caves and holes in
the ground.
39 All of these people we have
men oned received God’s approvalHEBREWS 11 – 12
50
because of their faith, yet none of them
received all that God had promised.
40 For God had far be er things in mind
for us that would also beneﬁt them, for
they can’t receive the prize at the end of
the race un l we ﬁnish the race.
1 Therefore, since we are
surrounded by such a huge crowd
of witnesses to the life of faith, let us
strip oﬀ every weight that slows us
down, especially the sin that so easily
hinders our progress. And let us run with
endurance the race that God has set
before us.
2 We do this by keeping our eyes on
Jesus, on whom our faith depends from
start to ﬁnish. He was willing to die a
shameful death on the cross because of
the joy he knew would be his a erward.
Now he is seated in the place of highest
honor beside God’s throne in heaven.
12HEBREWS 12
51
3 Think about all he endured when
sinful people did such terrible things to
him, so that you don’t become weary
and give up.
4 A er all, you have not yet given your
lives in your struggle against sin.
5 And have you en rely forgo en the
encouraging words God spoke to you,
his children? He said, "My child, don’t
ignore it when the Lord disciplines you,
and don’t be discouraged when he
corrects you.
6 For the Lord disciplines those he loves,
and he punishes those he accepts as his
children."
7 As you endure this divine discipline,
remember that God is trea ng you as his
own children. Whoever heard of a child
who was never disciplined?
8 If God doesn’t discipline you as he
does all of his children, it means thatHEBREWS 12
52
you are illegi mate and are not really his
children a er all.
9 Since we respect our earthly fathers
who disciplined us, should we not all the
more cheerfully submit to the discipline
of our heavenly Father and live forever?
10 For our earthly fathers disciplined
us for a few years, doing the best they
knew how. But God’s discipline is always
right and good for us because it means
we will share in his holiness.
11 No discipline is enjoyable while it is
happening––it is painful! But a erward
there will be a quiet harvest of right
living for those who are trained in this
way.
12 So take a new grip with your red
hands and stand ﬁrm on your shaky legs.
13 Mark out a straight path for your
feet. Then those who follow you, though
they are weak and lame, will not stumble
and fall but will become strong.HEBREWS 12
53
14 Try to live in peace with everyone,
and seek to live a clean and holy life, for
those who are not holy will not see the
Lord.
15 Look a er each other so that none
of you will miss out on the special
favor of God. Watch out that no bi er
root of unbelief rises up among you,
for whenever it springs up, many are
corrupted by its poison.
16 Make sure that no one is immoral or
godless like Esau. He traded his birthright
as the oldest son for a single meal.
17 And a erward, when he wanted his
father’s blessing, he was rejected. It was
too late for repentance, even though he
wept bi er tears.
18 You have not come to a physical
mountain, to a place of ﬂaming ﬁre,
darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, as the
Israelites did at Mount Sinai when God
gave them his laws.HEBREWS 12
54
19 For they heard an awesome trumpet
blast and a voice with a message so
terrible that they begged God to stop
speaking.
20 They staggered back under God’s
command: "If even an animal touches
the mountain, it must be stoned to
death."
21 Moses himself was so frightened at
the sight that he said, "I am terriﬁed and
trembling."
22 No, you have come to Mount Zion, to
the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to thousands of angels in
joyful assembly.
23 You have come to the assembly of
God’s ﬁrstborn children, whose names
are wri en in heaven. You have come
to God himself, who is the judge of all
people. And you have come to the spirits
of the redeemed in heaven who have
now been made perfect.HEBREWS 12
55
24 You have come to Jesus, the one who
mediates the new covenant between
God and people, and to the sprinkled
blood, which graciously forgives instead
of crying out for vengeance as the blood
of Abel did.
25 See to it that you obey God, the one
who is speaking to you. For if the people
of Israel did not escape when they
refused to listen to Moses, the earthly
messenger, how terrible our danger if
we reject the One who speaks to us from
heaven!
26 When God spoke from Mount Sinai
his voice shook the earth, but now he
makes another promise: "Once again
I will shake not only the earth but the
heavens also."
27 This means that the things on earth
will be shaken, so that only eternal
things will be le .HEBREWS 12 – 13
56
28 Since we are receiving a Kingdom
that cannot be destroyed, let us be
thankful and please God by worshiping
him with holy fear and awe.
29 For our God is a consuming ﬁre.
1 Con nue to love each other
with true Chris an love.
2 Don’t forget to show hospitality to
strangers, for some who have done
this have entertained angels without
realizing it!
3 Don’t forget about those in prison.
Suﬀer with them as though you were
there yourself. Share the sorrow of those
being mistreated, as though you feel
their pain in your own bodies.
4 Give honor to marriage, and remain
faithful to one another in marriage. God
will surely judge people who are immoral
and those who commit adultery.
5 Stay away from the love of money; be
sa sﬁed with what you have. For God
13HEBREWS 13
57
has said, "I will never fail you. I will never
forsake you."
6 That is why we can say with
conﬁdence, "The Lord is my helper,
so I will not be afraid. What can mere
mortals do to me?"
7 Remember your leaders who ﬁrst
taught you the word of God. Think of all
the good that has come from their lives,
and trust the Lord as they do.
8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
today, and forever.
9 So do not be a racted by strange, new
ideas. Your spiritual strength comes from
God’s special favor, not from ceremonial
rules about food, which don’t help those
who follow them.
10 We have an altar from which the
priests in the Temple on earth have no
right to eat.
11 Under the system of Jewish laws, the
high priest brought the blood of animalsHEBREWS 13
58
into the Holy Place as a sacriﬁce for
sin, but the bodies of the animals were
burned outside the camp.
12 So also Jesus suﬀered and died
outside the city gates in order to make
his people holy by shedding his own
blood.
13 So let us go out to him outside the
camp and bear the disgrace he bore.
14 For this world is not our home; we
are looking forward to our city in heaven,
which is yet to come.
15 With Jesus’ help, let us con nually
oﬀer our sacriﬁce of praise to God by
proclaiming the glory of his name.
16 Don’t forget to do good and to share
what you have with those in need, for
such sacriﬁces are very pleasing to God.
17 Obey your spiritual leaders and do
what they say. Their work is to watch
over your souls, and they know they are
accountable to God. Give them reasonHEBREWS 13
59
to do this joyfully and not with sorrow.
That would certainly not be for your
beneﬁt.
18 Pray for us, for our conscience is
clear and we want to live honorably in
everything we do.
19 I especially need your prayers right
now so that I can come back to you soon.
20 And now, may the God of peace, who
brought again from the dead our Lord
Jesus,
21 equip you with all you need for
doing his will. May he produce in you,
through the power of Jesus Christ, all
that is pleasing to him. Jesus is the great
Shepherd of the sheep by an everlas ng
covenant, signed with his blood. To him
be glory forever and ever. Amen.
22 I urge you, dear brothers and sisters,
please listen carefully to what I have said
in this brief le er.HEBREWS 13
60
23 I want you to know that our brother
Timothy is now out of jail. If he comes
here soon, I will bring him with me to
see you.
24 Give my gree ngs to all your leaders
and to the other believers there. The
Chris ans from Italy send you their
gree ngs.
25 May God’s grace be with you all.James
1 This le
er is from James, a slave of
God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. It
is wri en to Jewish Chris ans sca ered
among the na ons. Gree ngs!
2 Dear brothers and sisters, whenever
trouble comes your way, let it be an
opportunity for joy.
3 For when your faith is tested, your
endurance has a chance to grow.
4 So let it grow, for when your
endurance is fully developed, you will
be strong in character and ready for
anything.
5 If you need wisdom––if you want to
know what God wants you to do––ask
him, and he will gladly tell you. He will
not resent your asking.
1JAMES 1
2
6 But when you ask him, be sure that
you really expect him to answer, for a
doub ul mind is as unse led as a wave
of the sea that is driven and tossed by
the wind.
7 People like that should not expect to
receive anything from the Lord.
8 They can’t make up their minds. They
waver back and forth in everything they
do.
9 Chris ans who are poor should be
glad, for God has honored them.
10 And those who are rich should be
glad, for God has humbled them. They
will fade away like a ﬂower in the ﬁeld.
11 The hot sun rises and dries up the
grass; the ﬂower withers, and its beauty
fades away. So also, wealthy people will
fade away with all of their achievements.
12 God blesses the people who pa ently
endure tes ng. A erward they willJAMES 1
3
receive the crown of life that God has
promised to those who love him.
13 And remember, no one who wants
to do wrong should ever say, "God is
temp ng me." God is never tempted to
do wrong, and he never tempts anyone
else either.
14 Tempta on comes from the lure of
our own evil desires.
15 These evil desires lead to evil ac ons,
and evil ac ons lead to death.
16 So don’t be misled, my dear brothers
and sisters.
17 Whatever is good and perfect comes
to us from God above, who created all
heaven’s lights. Unlike them, he never
changes or casts shi ing shadows.
18 In his goodness he chose to make
us his own children by giving us his
true word. And we, out of all crea on,
became his choice possession.JAMES 1
4
19 My dear brothers and sisters, be
quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow
to get angry.
20 Your anger can never make things
right in God’s sight.
21 So get rid of all the ﬁlth and evil
in your lives, and humbly accept the
message God has planted in your hearts,
for it is strong enough to save your souls.
22 And remember, it is a message to
obey, not just to listen to. If you don’t
obey, you are only fooling yourself.
23 For if you just listen and don’t obey,
it is like looking at your face in a mirror
but doing nothing to improve your
appearance.
24 You see yourself, walk away, and
forget what you look like.
25 But if you keep looking steadily into
God’s perfect law––the law that sets you
free––and if you do what it says andJAMES 1 – 2
5
don’t forget what you heard, then God
will bless you for doing it.
26 If you claim to be religious but don’t
control your tongue, you are just fooling
yourself, and your religion is worthless.
27 Pure and las ng religion in the sight
of God our Father means that we must
care for orphans and widows in their
troubles, and refuse to let the world
corrupt us.
1 My dear brothers and sisters, how
can you claim that you have faith in
our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor
some people more than others?
2 For instance, suppose someone
comes into your mee ng dressed in
fancy clothes and expensive jewelry,
and another comes in who is poor and
dressed in shabby clothes.
3 If you give special a en on and a
good seat to the rich person, but you say
2JAMES 2
6
to the poor one, "You can stand over
there, or else sit on the ﬂoor"––well,
4 doesn’t this discrimina on show that
you are guided by wrong mo ves?
5 Listen to me, dear brothers and
sisters. Hasn’t God chosen the poor in
this world to be rich in faith? Aren’t they
the ones who will inherit the Kingdom
he promised to those who love him?
6 And yet, you insult the poor man! Isn’t
it the rich who oppress you and drag you
into court?
7 Aren’t they the ones who slander
Jesus Christ, whose noble name you
bear?
8 Yes indeed, it is good when you truly
obey our Lord’s royal command found in
the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor as
yourself."
9 But if you pay special a en on to the
rich, you are commi ng a sin, for you
are guilty of breaking that law.JAMES 2
7
10 And the person who keeps all of the
laws except one is as guilty as the person
who has broken all of God’s laws.
11 For the same God who said, "Do not
commit adultery," also said, "Do not
murder." So if you murder someone, you
have broken the en re law, even if you
do not commit adultery.
12 So whenever you speak, or whatever
you do, remember that you will be
judged by the law of love, the law that
set you free.
13 For there will be no mercy for you if
you have not been merciful to others.
But if you have been merciful, then
God’s mercy toward you will win out
over his judgment against you.
14 Dear brothers and sisters, what’s the
use of saying you have faith if you don’t
prove it by your ac ons? That kind of
faith can’t save anyone.JAMES 2
8
15 Suppose you see a brother or sister
who needs food or clothing,
16 and you say, "Well, good–bye and
God bless you; stay warm and eat
well"––but then you don’t give that
person any food or clothing. What good
does that do?
17 So you see, it isn’t enough just to
have faith. Faith that doesn’t show itself
by good deeds is no faith at all––it is
dead and useless.
18 Now someone may argue, "Some
people have faith; others have good
deeds." I say, "I can’t see your faith if you
don’t have good deeds, but I will show
you my faith through my good deeds."
19 Do you s ll think it’s enough just
to believe that there is one God? Well,
even the demons believe this, and they
tremble in terror!JAMES 2
9
20 Fool! When will you ever learn that
faith that does not result in good deeds
is useless?
21 Don’t you remember that our
ancestor Abraham was declared right
with God because of what he did when
he oﬀered his son Isaac on the altar?
22 You see, he was trus ng God so
much that he was willing to do whatever
God told him to do. His faith was made
complete by what he did––by his ac ons.
23 And so it happened just as the
Scriptures say: "Abraham believed God,
so God declared him to be righteous."
He was even called "the friend of God."
24 So you see, we are made right with
God by what we do, not by faith alone.
25 Rahab the pros tute is another
example of this. She was made right with
God by her ac ons––when she hid those
messengers and sent them safely away
by a diﬀerent road.JAMES 2 – 3
10
26 Just as the body is dead without a
spirit, so also faith is dead without good
deeds.
1 Dear brothers and sisters, not many
of you should become teachers in
the church, for we who teach will be
judged by God with greater strictness.
2 We all make many mistakes, but
those who control their tongues can also
control themselves in every other way.
3 We can make a large horse turn
around and go wherever we want by
means of a small bit in its mouth.
4 And a ny rudder makes a huge ship
turn wherever the pilot wants it to go,
even though the winds are strong.
5 So also, the tongue is a small thing,
but what enormous damage it can do. A
ny spark can set a great forest on ﬁre.
6 And the tongue is a ﬂame of ﬁre.
It is full of wickedness that can ruin
your whole life. It can turn the en re
3JAMES 3
11
course of your life into a blazing ﬂame
of destruc on, for it is set on ﬁre by hell
itself.
7 People can tame all kinds of animals
and birds and rep les and ﬁsh,
8 but no one can tame the tongue. It
is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly
poison.
9 Some mes it praises our Lord and
Father, and some mes it breaks out into
curses against those who have been
made in the image of God.
10 And so blessing and cursing come
pouring out of the same mouth. Surely,
my brothers and sisters, this is not right!
11 Does a spring of water bubble out
with both fresh water and bi er water?
12 Can you pick olives from a ﬁg tree or
ﬁgs from a grapevine? No, and you can’t
draw fresh water from a salty pool.
13 If you are wise and understand God’s
ways, live a life of steady goodness soJAMES 3
12
that only good deeds will pour forth.
And if you don’t brag about the good
you do, then you will be truly wise!
14 But if you are bi erly jealous and
there is selﬁsh ambi on in your hearts,
don’t brag about being wise. That is the
worst kind of lie.
15 For jealousy and selﬁshness are not
God’s kind of wisdom. Such things are
earthly, unspiritual, and mo vated by
the Devil.
16 For wherever there is jealousy and
selﬁsh ambi on, there you will ﬁnd
disorder and every kind of evil.
17 But the wisdom that comes from
heaven is ﬁrst of all pure. It is also peace
loving, gentle at all mes, and willing to
yield to others. It is full of mercy and
good deeds. It shows no par ality and is
always sincere.JAMES 3 – 4
13
18 And those who are peacemakers will
plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest
of goodness.
1 What is causing the quarrels and
ﬁghts among you? Isn’t it the whole
army of evil desires at war within you?
2 You want what you don’t have, so
you scheme and kill to get it. You are
jealous for what others have, and you
can’t possess it, so you ﬁght and quarrel
to take it away from them. And yet the
reason you don’t have what you want is
that you don’t ask God for it.
3 And even when you do ask, you don’t
get it because your whole mo ve is
wrong––you want only what will give
you pleasure.
4 You adulterers! Don’t you realize that
friendship with this world makes you an
enemy of God? I say it again, that if your
aim is to enjoy this world, you can’t be a
friend of God.
4JAMES 4
14
5 What do you think the Scriptures
mean when they say that the Holy
Spirit, whom God has placed within us,
jealously longs for us to be faithful?
6 He gives us more and more strength
to stand against such evil desires. As the
Scriptures say, "God sets himself against
the proud, but he shows favor to the
humble."
7 So humble yourselves before God.
Resist the Devil, and he will ﬂee from
you.
8 Draw close to God, and God will
draw close to you. Wash your hands,
you sinners; purify your hearts, you
hypocrites.
9 Let there be tears for the wrong things
you have done. Let there be sorrow and
deep grief. Let there be sadness instead
of laughter, and gloom instead of joy.JAMES 4
15
10 When you bow down before the Lord
and admit your dependence on him, he
will li you up and give you honor.
11 Don’t speak evil against each other,
my dear brothers and sisters. If you
cri cize each other and condemn each
other, then you are cri cizing and
condemning God’s law. But you are not
a judge who can decide whether the law
is right or wrong. Your job is to obey it.
12 God alone, who made the law, can
rightly judge among us. He alone has
the power to save or to destroy. So what
right do you have to condemn your
neighbor?
13 Look here, you people who say,
"Today or tomorrow we are going to a
certain town and will stay there a year.
We will do business there and make a
proﬁt."
14 How do you know what will happen
tomorrow? For your life is like theJAMES 4 – 5
16
morning fog––it’s here a li le while,
then it’s gone.
15 What you ought to say is, "If the Lord
wants us to, we will live and do this or
that."
16 Otherwise you will be boas ng about
your own plans, and all such boas ng is
evil.
17 Remember, it is sin to know what you
ought to do and then not do it.
1 Look here, you rich people, weep
and groan with anguish because of
all the terrible troubles ahead of you.
2 Your wealth is ro ng away, and your
ﬁne clothes are moth–eaten rags.
3 Your gold and silver have become
worthless. The very wealth you were
coun ng on will eat away your ﬂesh in
hell. This treasure you have accumulated
will stand as evidence against you on the
day of judgment.
5JAMES 5
17
4 For listen! Hear the cries of the ﬁeld
workers whom you have cheated of
their pay. The wages you held back
cry out against you. The cries of the
reapers have reached the ears of the
Lord Almighty.
5 You have spent your years on earth in
luxury, sa sfying your every whim. Now
your hearts are nice and fat, ready for
the slaughter.
6 You have condemned and killed good
people who had no power to defend
themselves against you.
7 Dear brothers and sisters, you must be
pa ent as you wait for the Lord’s return.
Consider the farmers who eagerly look
for the rains in the fall and in the spring.
They pa ently wait for the precious
harvest to ripen.
8 You, too, must be pa ent. And take
courage, for the coming of the Lord is
near.JAMES 5
18
9 Don’t grumble about each other, my
brothers and sisters, or God will judge
you. For look! The great Judge is coming.
He is standing at the door!
10 For examples of pa ence in suﬀering,
dear brothers and sisters, look at the
prophets who spoke in the name of the
Lord.
11 We give great honor to those
who endure under suﬀering. Job is
an example of a man who endured
pa ently. From his experience we see
how the Lord’s plan ﬁnally ended in
good, for he is full of tenderness and
mercy.
12 But most of all, my brothers and
sisters, never take an oath, by heaven or
earth or anything else. Just say a simple
yes or no, so that you will not sin and be
condemned for it.
13 Are any among you suﬀering? They
should keep on praying about it. AndJAMES 5
19
those who have reason to be thankful
should con nually sing praises to the
Lord.
14 Are any among you sick? They should
call for the elders of the church and have
them pray over them, anoin ng them
with oil in the name of the Lord.
15 And their prayer oﬀered in faith
will heal the sick, and the Lord will
make them well. And anyone who has
commi ed sins will be forgiven.
16 Confess your sins to each other and
pray for each other so that you may be
healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous
person has great power and wonderful
results.
17 Elijah was as human as we are, and
yet when he prayed earnestly that no
rain would fall, none fell for the next
three and a half years!JAMES 5
20
18 Then he prayed for rain, and down it
poured. The grass turned green, and the
crops began to grow again.
19 My dear brothers and sisters, if
anyone among you wanders away from
the truth and is brought back again,
20 you can be sure that the one who
brings that person back will save that
sinner from death and bring about the
forgiveness of many sins.1 Peter
1 This le
er is from Peter, an apostle
of Jesus Christ. I am wri ng to
God’s chosen people who are living as
foreigners in the lands of Pontus, Gala a,
Cappadocia, the province of Asia, and
Bithynia.
2 God the Father chose you long ago,
and the Spirit has made you holy. As a
result, you have obeyed Jesus Christ and
are cleansed by his blood. May you have
more and more of God’s special favor
and wonderful peace.
3 All honor to the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is by his
boundless mercy that God has given us
the privilege of being born again. Now
we live with a wonderful expecta on
11 PETER 1
2
because Jesus Christ rose again from the
dead.
4 For God has reserved a priceless
inheritance for his children. It is kept
in heaven for you, pure and undeﬁled,
beyond the reach of change and decay.
5 And God, in his mighty power, will
protect you un l you receive this
salva on, because you are trus ng him.
It will be revealed on the last day for all
to see.
6 So be truly glad! There is wonderful
joy ahead, even though it is necessary
for you to endure many trials for a while.
7 These trials are only to test your faith,
to show that it is strong and pure. It is
being tested as ﬁre tests and puriﬁes
gold––and your faith is far more precious
to God than mere gold. So if your faith
remains strong a er being tried by ﬁery
trials, it will bring you much praise and1 PETER 1
3
glory and honor on the day when Jesus
Christ is revealed to the whole world.
8 You love him even though you have
never seen him. Though you do not see
him, you trust him; and even now you
are happy with a glorious, inexpressible
joy.
9 Your reward for trus ng him will be
the salva on of your souls.
10 This salva on was something the
prophets wanted to know more about.
They prophesied about this gracious
salva on prepared for you, even though
they had many ques ons as to what it all
could mean.
11 They wondered what the Spirit of
Christ within them was talking about
when he told them in advance about
Christ’s suﬀering and his great glory
a erward. They wondered when and to
whom all this would happen.1 PETER 1
4
12 They were told that these things
would not happen during their life me,
but many years later, during yours.
And now this Good News has been
announced by those who preached to
you in the power of the Holy Spirit sent
from heaven. It is all so wonderful that
even the angels are eagerly watching
these things happen.
13 So think clearly and exercise self–
control. Look forward to the special
blessings that will come to you at the
return of Jesus Christ.
14 Obey God because you are his
children. Don’t slip back into your old
ways of doing evil; you didn’t know any
be er then.
15 But now you must be holy in
everything you do, just as God––who
chose you to be his children––is holy.
16 For he himself has said, "You must be
holy because I am holy."1 PETER 1
5
17 And remember that the heavenly
Father to whom you pray has no favorites
when he judges. He will judge or reward
you according to what you do. So you
must live in reverent fear of him during
your me as foreigners here on earth.
18 For you know that God paid a ransom
to save you from the empty life you
inherited from your ancestors. And the
ransom he paid was not mere gold or
silver.
19 He paid for you with the precious
lifeblood of Christ, the sinless, spotless
Lamb of God.
20 God chose him for this purpose long
before the world began, but now in
these ﬁnal days, he was sent to the earth
for all to see. And he did this for you.
21 Through Christ you have come to
trust in God. And because God raised
Christ from the dead and gave him great1 PETER 1
6
glory, your faith and hope can be placed
conﬁdently in God.
22 Now you can have sincere love
for each other as brothers and sisters
because you were cleansed from your
sins when you accepted the truth of the
Good News. So see to it that you really
do love each other intensely with all
your hearts.
23 For you have been born again. Your
new life did not come from your earthly
parents because the life they gave you
will end in death. But this new life will
last forever because it comes from the
eternal, living word of God.
24 As the prophet says, "People are like
grass that dies away; their beauty fades
as quickly as the beauty of wildﬂowers.
The grass withers, and the ﬂowers fall
away.1 PETER 1 – 2
7
25 But the word of the Lord will last
forever." And that word is the Good
News that was preached to you.
1 So get rid of all malicious behavior
and deceit. Don’t just pretend to
be good! Be done with hypocrisy and
jealousy and backstabbing.
2 You must crave pure spiritual milk
so that you can grow into the fullness
of your salva on. Cry out for this
nourishment as a baby cries for milk,
3 now that you have had a taste of the
Lord’s kindness.
4 Come to Christ, who is the living
cornerstone of God’s temple. He was
rejected by the people, but he is precious
to God who chose him.
5 And now God is building you, as living
stones, into his spiritual temple. What’s
more, you are God’s holy priests, who
oﬀer the spiritual sacriﬁces that please
him because of Jesus Christ.
21 PETER 2
8
6 As the Scriptures express it, "I am
placing a stone in Jerusalem, a chosen
cornerstone, and anyone who believes
in him will never be disappointed."
7 Yes, he is very precious to you who
believe. But for those who reject
him, "The stone that was rejected
by the builders has now become the
cornerstone."
8 And the Scriptures also say, "He is
the stone that makes people stumble,
the rock that will make them fall." They
stumble because they do not listen to
God’s word or obey it, and so they meet
the fate that has been planned for them.
9 But you are not like that, for you are
a chosen people. You are a kingdom
of priests, God’s holy na on, his very
own possession. This is so you can show
others the goodness of God, for he
called you out of the darkness into his
wonderful light.1 PETER 2
9
10 "Once you were not a people; now
you are the people of God. Once you
received none of God’s mercy; now you
have received his mercy."
11 Dear brothers and sisters, you are
foreigners and aliens here. So I warn you
to keep away from evil desires because
they ﬁght against your very souls.
12 Be careful how you live among your
unbelieving neighbors. Even if they
accuse you of doing wrong, they will see
your honorable behavior, and they will
believe and give honor to God when he
comes to judge the world.
13 For the Lord’s sake, accept all
authority––the king as head of state,
14 and the oﬃcials he has appointed.
For the king has sent them to punish all
who do wrong and to honor those who
do right.1 PETER 2
10
15 It is God’s will that your good lives
should silence those who make foolish
accusa ons against you.
16 You are not slaves; you are free. But
your freedom is not an excuse to do evil.
You are free to live as God’s slaves.
17 Show respect for everyone. Love
your Chris an brothers and sisters. Fear
God. Show respect for the king.
18 You who are slaves must accept the
authority of your masters. Do whatever
they tell you––not only if they are kind
and reasonable, but even if they are
harsh.
19 For God is pleased with you when,
for the sake of your conscience, you
pa ently endure unfair treatment.
20 Of course, you get no credit for
being pa ent if you are beaten for doing
wrong. But if you suﬀer for doing right
and are pa ent beneath the blows, God
is pleased with you.1 PETER 2 – 3
11
21 This suﬀering is all part of what God
has called you to. Christ, who suﬀered
for you, is your example. Follow in his
steps.
22 He never sinned, and he never
deceived anyone.
23 He did not retaliate when he was
insulted. When he suﬀered, he did not
threaten to get even. He le his case in
the hands of God, who always judges
fairly.
24 He personally carried away our sins
in his own body on the cross so we can
be dead to sin and live for what is right.
You have been healed by his wounds!
25 Once you were wandering like lost
sheep. But now you have turned to your
Shepherd, the Guardian of your souls.
1 In the same way, you wives
must accept the authority of your
husbands, even those who refuse to
accept the Good News. Your godly lives
31 PETER 3
12
will speak to them be er than any
words. They will be won over
2 by watching your pure, godly behavior.
3 Don’t be concerned about the
outward beauty that depends on
fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or
beau ful clothes.
4 You should be known for the beauty
that comes from within, the unfading
beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which
is so precious to God.
5 That is the way the holy women of
old made themselves beau ful. They
trusted God and accepted the authority
of their husbands.
6 For instance, Sarah obeyed her
husband, Abraham, when she called him
her master. You are her daughters when
you do what is right without fear of what
your husbands might do.
7 In the same way, you husbands must
give honor to your wives. Treat her with1 PETER 3
13
understanding as you live together. She
may be weaker than you are, but she is
your equal partner in God’s gi of new
life. If you don’t treat her as you should,
your prayers will not be heard.
8 Finally, all of you should be of one
mind, full of sympathy toward each
other, loving one another with tender
hearts and humble minds.
9 Don’t repay evil for evil. Don’t retaliate
when people say unkind things about
you. Instead, pay them back with a
blessing. That is what God wants you to
do, and he will bless you for it.
10 For the Scriptures say, "If you want
a happy life and good days, keep your
tongue from speaking evil, and keep
your lips from telling lies.
11 Turn away from evil and do good.
Work hard at living in peace with others.
12 The eyes of the Lord watch over
those who do right, and his ears are1 PETER 3
14
open to their prayers. But the Lord turns
his face against those who do evil."
13 Now, who will want to harm you if
you are eager to do good?
14 But even if you suﬀer for doing what
is right, God will reward you for it. So
don’t be afraid and don’t worry.
15 Instead, you must worship Christ as
Lord of your life. And if you are asked
about your Chris an hope, always be
ready to explain it.
16 But you must do this in a gentle and
respec ul way. Keep your conscience
clear. Then if people speak evil against
you, they will be ashamed when they
see what a good life you live because
you belong to Christ.
17 Remember, it is be er to suﬀer for
doing good, if that is what God wants,
than to suﬀer for doing wrong!
18 Christ also suﬀered when he died
for our sins once for all me. He never1 PETER 3
15
sinned, but he died for sinners that he
might bring us safely home to God. He
suﬀered physical death, but he was
raised to life in the Spirit.
19 So he went and preached to the
spirits in prison––
20 those who disobeyed God long
ago when God waited pa ently while
Noah was building his boat. Only eight
people were saved from drowning in
that terrible ﬂood.
21 And this is a picture of bap sm,
which now saves you by the power of
Jesus Christ’s resurrec on. Bap sm is
not a removal of dirt from your body;
it is an appeal to God from a clean
conscience.
22 Now Christ has gone to heaven. He
is seated in the place of honor next to
God, and all the angels and authori es
and powers are bowing before him.1 PETER 4
4
16
1 So then, since Christ suﬀered
physical pain, you must arm
yourselves with the same a tude he
had, and be ready to suﬀer, too. For if
you are willing to suﬀer for Christ, you
have decided to stop sinning.
2 And you won’t spend the rest of your
life chasing a er evil desires, but you will
be anxious to do the will of God.
3 You have had enough in the past
of the evil things that godless people
enjoy––their immorality and lust, their
feas ng and drunkenness and wild
par es, and their terrible worship of
idols.
4 Of course, your former friends are
very surprised when you no longer join
them in the wicked things they do, and
they say evil things about you.
5 But just remember that they will have
to face God, who will judge everyone,
both the living and the dead.1 PETER 4
17
6 That is why the Good News was
preached even to those who have
died––so that although their bodies
were punished with death, they could
s ll live in the spirit as God does.
7 The end of the world is coming soon.
Therefore, be earnest and disciplined in
your prayers.
8 Most important of all, con nue to
show deep love for each other, for love
covers a mul tude of sins.
9 Cheerfully share your home with
those who need a meal or a place to
stay.
10 God has given gi s to each of
you from his great variety of spiritual
gi s. Manage them well so that God’s
generosity can ﬂow through you.
11 Are you called to be a speaker?
Then speak as though God himself were
speaking through you. Are you called to
help others? Do it with all the strength1 PETER 4
18
and energy that God supplies. Then God
will be given glory in everything through
Jesus Christ. All glory and power belong
to him forever and ever. Amen.
12 Dear friends, don’t be surprised at
the ﬁery trials you are going through, as
if something strange were happening to
you.
13 Instead, be very glad––because these
trials will make you partners with Christ
in his suﬀering, and a erward you will
have the wonderful joy of sharing his
glory when it is displayed to all the
world.
14 Be happy if you are insulted for being
a Chris an, for then the glorious Spirit of
God will come upon you.
15 If you suﬀer, however, it must not be
for murder, stealing, making trouble, or
prying into other people’s aﬀairs.1 PETER 4 – 5
19
16 But it is no shame to suﬀer for being
a Chris an. Praise God for the privilege
of being called by his wonderful name!
17 For the me has come for judgment,
and it must begin ﬁrst among God’s own
children. And if even we Chris ans must
be judged, what terrible fate awaits
those who have never believed God’s
Good News?
18 And "If the righteous are barely
saved, what chance will the godless and
sinners have?"
19 So if you are suﬀering according to
God’s will, keep on doing what is right,
and trust yourself to the God who made
you, for he will never fail you.
1 And now, a word to you who are
elders in the churches. I, too, am an
elder and a witness to the suﬀerings of
Christ. And I, too, will share his glory and
his honor when he returns. As a fellow
elder, this is my appeal to you:
51 PETER 5
20
2 Care for the ﬂock of God entrusted
to you. Watch over it willingly, not
grudgingly––not for what you will get
out of it, but because you are eager to
serve God.
3 Don’t lord it over the people assigned
to your care, but lead them by your good
example.
4 And when the head Shepherd comes,
your reward will be a never–ending
share in his glory and honor.
5 You younger men, accept the
authority of the elders. And all of you,
serve each other in humility, for "God
sets himself against the proud, but he
shows favor to the humble."
6 So humble yourselves under the
mighty power of God, and in his good
me he will honor you.
7 Give all your worries and cares to God,
for he cares about what happens to you.1 PETER 5
8 Be careful! Watch out for a
21
acks from
the Devil, your great enemy. He prowls
around like a roaring lion, looking for
some vic m to devour.
9 Take a ﬁrm stand against him, and be
strong in your faith. Remember that your
Chris an brothers and sisters all over the
world are going through the same kind
of suﬀering you are.
10 In his kindness God called you to his
eternal glory by means of Jesus Christ.
A er you have suﬀered a li le while,
he will restore, support, and strengthen
you, and he will place you on a ﬁrm
founda on.
11 All power is his forever and ever.
Amen.
12 I have wri en this short le er to you
with the help of Silas, whom I consider
a faithful brother. My purpose in wri ng
is to encourage you and assure you that1 PETER 5
22
the grace of God is with you no ma er
what happens.
13 Your sister church here in Rome
sends you gree ngs, and so does my son
Mark.
14 Greet each other in Chris an love.
Peace be to all of you who are in Christ.2 Peter
1 This le
er is from Simon Peter, a
slave and apostle of Jesus Christ. I
am wri ng to all of you who share the
same precious faith we have, faith given
to us by Jesus Christ, our God and Savior,
who makes us right with God.
2 May God bless you with his special
favor and wonderful peace as you come
to know Jesus, our God and Lord, be er
and be er.
3 As we know Jesus be er, his divine
power gives us everything we need for
living a godly life. He has called us to
receive his own glory and goodness!
4 And by that same mighty power, he
has given us all of his rich and wonderful
promises. He has promised that you will
escape the decadence all around you
12 PETER 1
2
caused by evil desires and that you will
share in his divine nature.
5 So make every eﬀort to apply the
beneﬁts of these promises to your
life. Then your faith will produce a life
of moral excellence. A life of moral
excellence leads to knowing God be er.
6 Knowing God leads to self–control.
Self–control leads to pa ent endurance,
and pa ent endurance leads to
godliness.
7 Godliness leads to love for other
Chris ans, and ﬁnally you will grow to
have genuine love for everyone.
8 The more you grow like this, the more
you will become produc ve and useful in
your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 But those who fail to develop
these virtues are blind or, at least,
very shortsighted. They have already
forgo en that God has cleansed them
from their old life of sin.2 PETER 1
3
10 So, dear brothers and sisters, work
hard to prove that you really are among
those God has called and chosen. Doing
this, you will never stumble or fall away.
11 And God will open wide the gates of
heaven for you to enter into the eternal
Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.
12 I plan to keep on reminding you of
these things––even though you already
know them and are standing ﬁrm in the
truth.
13 Yes, I believe I should keep on
reminding you of these things as long as
I live.
14 But the Lord Jesus Christ has shown
me that my days here on earth are
numbered and I am soon to die.
15 So I will work hard to make these
things clear to you. I want you to
remember them long a er I am gone.2 PETER 1
4
16 For we were not making up clever
stories when we told you about the
power of our Lord Jesus Christ and his
coming again. We have seen his majes c
splendor with our own eyes.
17 And he received honor and glory
from God the Father when God’s
glorious, majes c voice called down
from heaven, "This is my beloved Son; I
am fully pleased with him."
18 We ourselves heard the voice when
we were there with him on the holy
mountain.
19 Because of that, we have even
greater conﬁdence in the message
proclaimed by the prophets. Pay close
a en on to what they wrote, for their
words are like a light shining in a dark
place––un l the day Christ appears and
his brilliant light shines in your hearts.2 PETER 1 – 2
5
20 Above all, you must understand that
no prophecy in Scripture ever came from
the prophets themselves
21 or because they wanted to prophesy.
It was the Holy Spirit who moved the
prophets to speak from God.
1 But there were also false prophets
in Israel, just as there will be false
teachers among you. They will cleverly
teach their destruc ve heresies about
God and even turn against their Master
who bought them. Theirs will be a swi
and terrible end.
2 Many will follow their evil teaching
and shameful immorality. And because
of them, Christ and his true way will be
slandered.
3 In their greed they will make up clever
lies to get hold of your money. But God
condemned them long ago, and their
destruc on is on the way.
22 PETER 2
6
4 For God did not spare even the angels
when they sinned; he threw them into
hell, in gloomy caves and darkness un l
the judgment day.
5 And God did not spare the ancient
world––except for Noah and his family
of seven. Noah warned the world of
God’s righteous judgment. Then God
destroyed the whole world of ungodly
people with a vast ﬂood.
6 Later, he turned the ci es of Sodom
and Gomorrah into heaps of ashes and
swept them oﬀ the face of the earth.
He made them an example of what will
happen to ungodly people.
7 But at the same me, God rescued Lot
out of Sodom because he was a good
man who was sick of all the immorality
and wickedness around him.
8 Yes, he was a righteous man who was
distressed by the wickedness he saw and
heard day a er day.2 PETER 2
7
9 So you see, the Lord knows how to
rescue godly people from their trials,
even while punishing the wicked right
up un l the day of judgment.
10 He is especially hard on those who
follow their own evil, lus ul desires and
who despise authority. These people are
proud and arrogant, daring even to scoﬀ
at the glorious ones without so much as
trembling.
11 But the angels, even though they are
far greater in power and strength than
these false teachers, never speak out
disrespec ully against the glorious ones.
12 These false teachers are like
unthinking animals, creatures of ins nct,
who are born to be caught and killed.
They laugh at the terrifying powers they
know so li le about, and they will be
destroyed along with them.
13 Their destruc on is their reward for
the harm they have done. They love2 PETER 2
8
to indulge in evil pleasures in broad
daylight. They are a disgrace and a stain
among you. They revel in decei ulness
while they feast with you.
14 They commit adultery with their
eyes, and their lust is never sa sﬁed.
They make a game of luring unstable
people into sin. They train themselves to
be greedy; they are doomed and cursed.
15 They have wandered oﬀ the right
road and followed the way of Balaam
son of Beor, who loved to earn money
by doing wrong.
16 But Balaam was stopped from his
mad course when his donkey rebuked
him with a human voice.
17 These people are as useless as
dried–up springs of water or as clouds
blown away by the wind––promising
much and delivering nothing. They are
doomed to blackest darkness.2 PETER 2
18 They brag about themselves with
empty, foolish boas ng. With lus ul
desire as their bait, they lure back into
sin those who have just escaped from
such wicked living.
19 They promise freedom, but they
themselves are slaves to sin and
corrup on. For you are a slave to
whatever controls you.
20 And when people escape from the
wicked ways of the world by learning
about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
and then get tangled up with sin and
become its slave again, they are worse
oﬀ than before.
21 It would be be er if they had
never known the right way to live than
to know it and then reject the holy
commandments that were given to
them.
92 PETER 2 – 3
10
22 They make these proverbs come
true: "A dog returns to its vomit," and "A
washed pig returns to the mud."
1 This is my second le er to you,
dear friends, and in both of them I
have tried to s mulate your wholesome
thinking and refresh your memory.
2 I want you to remember and
understand what the holy prophets said
long ago and what our Lord and Savior
commanded through your apostles.
3 First, I want to remind you that in the
last days there will be scoﬀers who will
laugh at the truth and do every evil thing
they desire.
4 This will be their argument: "Jesus
promised to come back, did he? Then
where is he? Why, as far back as anyone
can remember, everything has remained
exactly the same since the world was
ﬁrst created."
32 PETER 3
11
5 They deliberately forget that God
made the heavens by the word of his
command, and he brought the earth up
from the water and surrounded it with
water.
6 Then he used the water to destroy the
world with a mighty ﬂood.
7 And God has also commanded
that the heavens and the earth will
be consumed by ﬁre on the day of
judgment, when ungodly people will
perish.
8 But you must not forget, dear friends,
that a day is like a thousand years to the
Lord, and a thousand years is like a day.
9 The Lord isn’t really being slow about
his promise to return, as some people
think. No, he is being pa ent for your
sake. He does not want anyone to perish,
so he is giving more me for everyone to
repent.2 PETER 3
12
10 But the day of the Lord will come
as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the
heavens will pass away with a terrible
noise, and everything in them will
disappear in ﬁre, and the earth and
everything on it will be exposed to
judgment.
11 Since everything around us is going
to melt away, what holy, godly lives you
should be living!
12 You should look forward to that day
and hurry it along––the day when God
will set the heavens on ﬁre and the
elements will melt away in the ﬂames.
13 But we are looking forward to the
new heavens and new earth he has
promised, a world where everyone is
right with God.
14 And so, dear friends, while you are
wai ng for these things to happen, make
every eﬀort to live a pure and blameless
life. And be at peace with God.2 PETER 3
15 And remember, the Lord is wai

ng so
that people have me to be saved. This
is just as our beloved brother Paul wrote
to you with the wisdom God gave him––
16 speaking of these things in all of
his le ers. Some of his comments are
hard to understand, and those who
are ignorant and unstable have twisted
his le ers around to mean something
quite diﬀerent from what he meant,
just as they do the other parts of
Scripture––and the result is disaster for
them.
17 I am warning you ahead of me,
dear friends, so that you can watch out
and not be carried away by the errors of
these wicked people. I don’t want you to
lose your own secure foo ng.
18 But grow in the special favor and
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. To him be all glory and honor,
both now and forevermore. Amen.1 John
1
1 The one who existed from the
beginning is the one we have heard
and seen. We saw him with our own
eyes and touched him with our own
hands. He is Jesus Christ, the Word of
life.
2 This one who is life from God was
shown to us, and we have seen him. And
now we tes fy and announce to you that
he is the one who is eternal life. He was
with the Father, and then he was shown
to us.
3 We are telling you about what we
ourselves have actually seen and heard,
so that you may have fellowship with us.
And our fellowship is with the Father
and with his Son, Jesus Christ.1 JOHN 1
4 We are wri
2
ng these things so that
our joy will be complete.
5 This is the message he has given us to
announce to you: God is light and there
is no darkness in him at all.
6 So we are lying if we say we have
fellowship with God but go on living in
spiritual darkness. We are not living in
the truth.
7 But if we are living in the light of
God’s presence, just as Christ is, then we
have fellowship with each other, and the
blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from
every sin.
8 If we say we have no sin, we are only
fooling ourselves and refusing to accept
the truth.
9 But if we confess our sins to him, he
is faithful and just to forgive us and to
cleanse us from every wrong.1 JOHN 1 – 2
3
10 If we claim we have not sinned, we
are calling God a liar and showing that
his word has no place in our hearts.
1 My dear children, I am wri ng this
to you so that you will not sin. But if
you do sin, there is someone to plead for
you before the Father. He is Jesus Christ,
the one who pleases God completely.
2 He is the sacriﬁce for our sins. He
takes away not only our sins but the sins
of all the world.
3 And how can we be sure that
we belong to him? By obeying his
commandments.
4 If someone says, "I belong to God,"
but doesn’t obey God’s commandments,
that person is a liar and does not live in
the truth.
5 But those who obey God’s word really
do love him. That is the way to know
whether or not we live in him.
21 JOHN 2
4
6 Those who say they live in God should
live their lives as Christ did.
7 Dear friends, I am not wri ng a new
commandment, for it is an old one
you have always had, right from the
beginning. This commandment––to love
one another––is the same message you
heard before.
8 Yet it is also new. This commandment
is true in Christ and is true among you,
because the darkness is disappearing
and the true light is already shining.
9 If anyone says, "I am living in the
light," but hates a Chris an brother
or sister, that person is s ll living in
darkness.
10 Anyone who loves other Chris ans
is living in the light and does not cause
anyone to stumble.
11 Anyone who hates a Chris an
brother or sister is living and walking in1 JOHN 2
5
darkness. Such a person is lost, having
been blinded by the darkness.
12 I am wri ng to you, my dear children,
because your sins have been forgiven
because of Jesus.
13 I am wri ng to you who are mature
because you know Christ, the one who is
from the beginning. I am wri ng to you
who are young because you have won
your ba le with Satan.
14 I have wri en to you, children,
because you have known the Father.
I have wri en to you who are mature
because you know Christ, the one who
is from the beginning. I have wri en
to you who are young because you are
strong with God’s word living in your
hearts, and you have won your ba le
with Satan.
15 Stop loving this evil world and all
that it oﬀers you, for when you love the1 JOHN 2
6
world, you show that you do not have
the love of the Father in you.
16 For the world oﬀers only the lust for
physical pleasure, the lust for everything
we see, and pride in our possessions.
These are not from the Father. They are
from this evil world.
17 And this world is fading away, along
with everything it craves. But if you do
the will of God, you will live forever.
18 Dear children, the last hour is here.
You have heard that the An christ
is coming, and already many such
an christs have appeared. From this
we know that the end of the world has
come.
19 These people le our churches
because they never really belonged with
us; otherwise they would have stayed
with us. When they le us, it proved that
they do not belong with us.1 JOHN 2
7
20 But you are not like that, for the Holy
Spirit has come upon you, and all of you
know the truth.
21 So I am wri ng to you not because
you don’t know the truth but because
you know the diﬀerence between truth
and falsehood.
22 And who is the great liar? The one
who says that Jesus is not the Christ.
Such people are an christs, for they
have denied the Father and the Son.
23 Anyone who denies the Son doesn’t
have the Father either. But anyone who
confesses the Son has the Father also.
24 So you must remain faithful to
what you have been taught from the
beginning. If you do, you will con nue to
live in fellowship with the Son and with
the Father.
25 And in this fellowship we enjoy the
eternal life he promised us.1 JOHN 2 – 3
26 I have wri
8
en these things to you
because you need to be aware of those
who want to lead you astray.
27 But you have received the Holy Spirit,
and he lives within you, so you don’t
need anyone to teach you what is true.
For the Spirit teaches you all things, and
what he teaches is true––it is not a lie.
So con nue in what he has taught you,
and con nue to live in Christ.
28 And now, dear children, con nue
to live in fellowship with Christ so that
when he returns, you will be full of
courage and not shrink back from him in
shame.
29 Since we know that God is always
right, we also know that all who do what
is right are his children.
1 See how very much our heavenly
Father loves us, for he allows us to
be called his children, and we really
are! But the people who belong to this
31 JOHN 3
9
world don’t know God, so they don’t
understand that we are his children.
2 Yes, dear friends, we are already God’s
children, and we can’t even imagine
what we will be like when Christ returns.
But we do know that when he comes we
will be like him, for we will see him as he
really is.
3 And all who believe this will keep
themselves pure, just as Christ is pure.
4 Those who sin are opposed to the law
of God, for all sin opposes the law of
God.
5 And you know that Jesus came to take
away our sins, for there is no sin in him.
6 So if we con nue to live in him, we
won’t sin either. But those who keep
on sinning have never known him or
understood who he is.
7 Dear children, don’t let anyone
deceive you about this: When people1 JOHN 3
10
do what is right, it is because they are
righteous, even as Christ is righteous.
8 But when people keep on sinning, it
shows they belong to the Devil, who has
been sinning since the beginning. But
the Son of God came to destroy these
works of the Devil.
9 Those who have been born into God’s
family do not sin, because God’s life is
in them. So they can’t keep on sinning,
because they have been born of God.
10 So now we can tell who are children
of God and who are children of the
Devil. Anyone who does not obey God’s
commands and does not love other
Chris ans does not belong to God.
11 This is the message we have heard
from the beginning: We should love one
another.
12 We must not be like Cain, who
belonged to the evil one and killed
his brother. And why did he kill him?1 JOHN 3
11
Because Cain had been doing what was
evil, and his brother had been doing
what was right.
13 So don’t be surprised, dear brothers
and sisters, if the world hates you.
14 If we love our Chris an brothers and
sisters, it proves that we have passed
from death to eternal life. But a person
who has no love is s ll dead.
15 Anyone who hates another Chris an
is really a murderer at heart. And you
know that murderers don’t have eternal
life within them.
16 We know what real love is because
Christ gave up his life for us. And so we
also ought to give up our lives for our
Chris an brothers and sisters.
17 But if anyone has enough money
to live well and sees a brother or sister
in need and refuses to help––how can
God’s love be in that person?1 JOHN 3
12
18 Dear children, let us stop just saying
we love each other; let us really show it
by our ac ons.
19 It is by our ac ons that we know
we are living in the truth, so we will be
conﬁdent when we stand before the
Lord,
20 even if our hearts condemn us. For
God is greater than our hearts, and he
knows everything.
21 Dear friends, if our conscience is
clear, we can come to God with bold
conﬁdence.
22 And we will receive whatever we
request because we obey him and do
the things that please him.
23 And this is his commandment: We
must believe in the name of his Son,
Jesus Christ, and love one another, just
as he commanded us.
24 Those who obey God’s
commandments live in fellowship1 JOHN 4
13
with him, and he with them. And we
know he lives in us because the Holy
Spirit lives in us.
1 Dear friends, do not believe
everyone who claims to speak by
the Spirit. You must test them to see if
the spirit they have comes from God.
For there are many false prophets in the
world.
2 This is the way to ﬁnd out if they
have the Spirit of God: If a prophet
acknowledges that Jesus Christ became
a human being, that person has the
Spirit of God.
3 If a prophet does not acknowledge
Jesus, that person is not from God. Such
a person has the spirit of the An christ.
You have heard that he is going to come
into the world, and he is already here.
4 But you belong to God, my dear
children. You have already won your
ﬁght with these false prophets, because
41 JOHN 4
14
the Spirit who lives in you is greater than
the spirit who lives in the world.
5 These people belong to this world, so
they speak from the world’s viewpoint,
and the world listens to them.
6 But we belong to God; that is why
those who know God listen to us. If they
do not belong to God, they do not listen
to us. That is how we know if someone
has the Spirit of truth or the spirit of
decep on.
7 Dear friends, let us con nue to love
one another, for love comes from God.
Anyone who loves is born of God and
knows God.
8 But anyone who does not love does
not know God––for God is love.
9 God showed how much he loved us
by sending his only Son into the world so
that we might have eternal life through
him.1 JOHN 4
15
10 This is real love. It is not that we
loved God, but that he loved us and sent
his Son as a sacriﬁce to take away our
sins.
11 Dear friends, since God loved us that
much, we surely ought to love each
other.
12 No one has ever seen God. But if we
love each other, God lives in us, and his
love has been brought to full expression
through us.
13 And God has given us his Spirit as
proof that we live in him and he in us.
14 Furthermore, we have seen with
our own eyes and now tes fy that the
Father sent his Son to be the Savior of
the world.
15 All who proclaim that Jesus is the Son
of God have God living in them, and they
live in God.
16 We know how much God loves us,
and we have put our trust in him. God is1 JOHN 4
16
love, and all who live in love live in God,
and God lives in them.
17 And as we live in God, our love grows
more perfect. So we will not be afraid
on the day of judgment, but we can face
him with conﬁdence because we are like
Christ here in this world.
18 Such love has no fear because perfect
love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is
for fear of judgment, and this shows that
his love has not been perfected in us.
19 We love each other as a result of his
loving us ﬁrst.
20 If someone says, "I love God," but
hates a Chris an brother or sister, that
person is a liar; for if we don’t love
people we can see, how can we love
God, whom we have not seen?
21 And God himself has commanded
that we must love not only him but our
Chris an brothers and sisters, too.1 JOHN 5
5
17
1 Everyone who believes that Jesus
is the Christ is a child of God. And
everyone who loves the Father loves his
children, too.
2 We know we love God’s children if we
love God and obey his commandments.
3 Loving God means keeping his
commandments, and really, that isn’t
diﬃcult.
4 For every child of God defeats this
evil world by trus ng Christ to give the
victory.
5 And the ones who win this ba le
against the world are the ones who
believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
6 And Jesus Christ was revealed as
God’s Son by his bap sm in water and by
shedding his blood on the cross ––not by
water only, but by water and blood. And
the Spirit also gives us the tes mony
that this is true.
7 So we have these three witnesses––1 JOHN 5
18
8 the Spirit, the water, and the
blood––and all three agree.
9 Since we believe human tes mony,
surely we can believe the tes mony that
comes from God. And God has tes ﬁed
about his Son.
10 All who believe in the Son of God
know that this is true. Those who don’t
believe this are actually calling God a liar
because they don’t believe what God
has tes ﬁed about his Son.
11 And this is what God has tes ﬁed: He
has given us eternal life, and this life is in
his Son.
12 So whoever has God’s Son has life;
whoever does not have his Son does not
have life.
13 I write this to you who believe in the
Son of God, so that you may know you
have eternal life.1 JOHN 5
19
14 And we can be conﬁdent that he will
listen to us whenever we ask him for
anything in line with his will.
15 And if we know he is listening when
we make our requests, we can be sure
that he will give us what we ask for.
16 If you see a Chris an brother or sister
sinning in a way that does not lead to
death, you should pray, and God will give
that person life. But there is a sin that
leads to death, and I am not saying you
should pray for those who commit it.
17 Every wrong is sin, but not all sin
leads to death.
18 We know that those who have
become part of God’s family do not
make a prac ce of sinning, for God’s Son
holds them securely, and the evil one
cannot get his hands on them.
19 We know that we are children of God
and that the world around us is under
the power and control of the evil one.1 JOHN 5
20
20 And we know that the Son of God has
come, and he has given us understanding
so that we can know the true God. And
now we are in God because we are in
his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the only true
God, and he is eternal life.
21 Dear children, keep away from
anything that might take God’s place in
your hearts.2 John
1 This le
er is from John the Elder. It
is wri en to the chosen lady and to
her children, whom I love in the truth,
as does everyone else who knows God’s
truth––
2 the truth that lives in us and will be in
our hearts forever.
3 May grace, mercy, and peace, which
come from God our Father and from
Jesus Christ his Son, be with us who live
in truth and love.
4 How happy I was to meet some of
your children and ﬁnd them living in the
truth, just as we have been commanded
by the Father.
5 And now I want to urge you, dear lady,
that we should love one another. This is
12 JOHN 1
2
not a new commandment, but one we
had from the beginning.
6 Love means doing what God has
commanded us, and he has commanded
us to love one another, just as you heard
from the beginning.
7 Many deceivers have gone out into
the world. They do not believe that Jesus
Christ came to earth in a real body. Such
a person is a deceiver and an an christ.
8 Watch out, so that you do not lose the
prize for which we have been working so
hard. Be diligent so that you will receive
your full reward.
9 For if you wander beyond the
teaching of Christ, you will not have
fellowship with God. But if you con nue
in the teaching of Christ, you will have
fellowship with both the Father and the
Son.
10 If someone comes to your mee ng
and does not teach the truth about2 JOHN 1
3
Christ, don’t invite him into your house
or encourage him in any way.
11 Anyone who encourages him
becomes a partner in his evil work.
12 Well, I have much more to say to you,
but I don’t want to say it in a le er. For
I hope to visit you soon and to talk with
you face to face. Then our joy will be
complete.
13 Gree ngs from the children of your
sister, chosen by God.3 John
1 This le
er is from John the Elder.
It is wri en to Gaius, my dear friend,
whom I love in the truth.
2 Dear friend, I am praying that all is
well with you and that your body is as
healthy as I know your soul is.
3 Some of the brothers recently
returned and made me very happy by
telling me about your faithfulness and
that you are living in the truth.
4 I could have no greater joy than to
hear that my children live in the truth.
5 Dear friend, you are doing a good
work for God when you take care of
the traveling teachers who are passing
through, even though they are strangers
to you.
13 JOHN 1
2
6 They have told the church here of
your friendship and your loving deeds.
You do well to send them on their way in
a manner that pleases God.
7 For they are traveling for the Lord and
accept nothing from those who are not
Chris ans.
8 So we ourselves should support them
so that we may become partners with
them for the truth.
9 I sent a brief le er to the church about
this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be
the leader, does not acknowledge our
authority.
10 When I come, I will report some of
the things he is doing and the wicked
things he is saying about us. He not
only refuses to welcome the traveling
teachers, he also tells others not to help
them. And when they do help, he puts
them out of the church.3 JOHN 1
3
11 Dear friend, don’t let this bad
example inﬂuence you. Follow only what
is good. Remember that those who do
good prove that they are God’s children,
and those who do evil prove that they
do not know God.
12 But everyone speaks highly of
Demetrius, even truth itself. We
ourselves can say the same for him, and
you know we speak the truth.
13 I have much to tell you, but I don’t
want to do it in a le er.
14 For I hope to see you soon, and then
we will talk face to face. (1:15) May
God’s peace be with you. Your friends
here send you their gree ngs. Please
give my personal gree ngs to each of
our friends there.Jude
1 This le

Jesus Christ and a brother of James. I
am wri ng to all who are called to live in
the love of God the Father and the care
of Jesus Christ.
2 May you receive more and more of
God’s mercy, peace, and love.
3 Dearly loved friends, I had been
eagerly planning to write to you about
the salva on we all share. But now I ﬁnd
that I must write about something else,
urging you to defend the truth of the
Good News. God gave this unchanging
truth once for all me to his holy people.
4 I say this because some godless
people have wormed their way in among
you, saying that God’s forgiveness allows
us to live immoral lives. The fate of
1JUDE 1
2
such people was determined long ago,
for they have turned against our only
Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
5 I must remind you––and you know
it well––that even though the Lord
rescued the whole na on of Israel from
Egypt, he later destroyed every one of
those who did not remain faithful.
6 And I remind you of the angels who
did not stay within the limits of authority
God gave them but le the place where
they belonged. God has kept them
chained in prisons of darkness, wai ng
for the day of judgment.
7 And don’t forget the ci es of Sodom
and Gomorrah and their neighboring
towns, which were ﬁlled with sexual
immorality and every kind of sexual
perversion. Those ci es were destroyed
by ﬁre and are a warning of the eternal
ﬁre that will punish all who are evil.JUDE 1
3
8 Yet these false teachers, who claim
authority from their dreams, live
immoral lives, defy authority, and scoﬀ
at the power of the glorious ones.
9 But even Michael, one of the migh est
of the angels, did not dare accuse Satan
of blasphemy, but simply said, "The
Lord rebuke you." (This took place when
Michael was arguing with Satan about
Moses’ body.)
10 But these people mock and curse
the things they do not understand. Like
animals, they do whatever their ins ncts
tell them, and they bring about their
own destruc on.
11 How terrible it will be for them! For
they follow the evil example of Cain,
who killed his brother. Like Balaam, they
will do anything for money. And like
Korah, they will perish because of their
rebellion.JUDE 1
4
12 When these people join you in
fellowship meals celebra ng the love
of the Lord, they are like dangerous
reefs that can shipwreck you. They are
shameless in the way they care only
about themselves. They are like clouds
blowing over dry land without giving
rain, promising much but producing
nothing. They are like trees without fruit
at harves me. They are not only dead
but doubly dead, for they have been
pulled out by the roots.
13 They are like wild waves of the sea,
churning up the dirty foam of their
shameful deeds. They are wandering
stars, heading for everlas ng gloom and
darkness.
14 Now Enoch, who lived seven
genera ons a er Adam, prophesied
about these people. He said, "Look, the
Lord is coming with thousands of his
holy ones.JUDE 1
5
15 He will bring the people of the world
to judgment. He will convict the ungodly
of all the evil things they have done
in rebellion and of all the insults that
godless sinners have spoken against
him."
16 These people are grumblers and
complainers, doing whatever evil
they feel like. They are loudmouthed
braggarts, and they ﬂa er others to get
favors in return.
17 But you, my dear friends, must
remember what the apostles of our Lord
Jesus Christ told you,
18 that in the last mes there would be
scoﬀers whose purpose in life is to enjoy
themselves in every evil way imaginable.
19 Now they are here, and they are the
ones who are crea ng divisions among
you. They live by natural ins nct because
they do not have God’s Spirit living in
them.JUDE 1
20 But you, dear friends, must con
6
nue
to build your lives on the founda on of
your holy faith. And con nue to pray as
you are directed by the Holy Spirit.
21 Live in such a way that God’s love can
bless you as you wait for the eternal life
that our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy is
going to give you.
22 Show mercy to those whose faith is
wavering.
23 Rescue others by snatching them
from the ﬂames of judgment. There are
s ll others to whom you need to show
mercy, but be careful that you aren’t
contaminated by their sins.
24 And now, all glory to God, who is able
to keep you from stumbling, and who
will bring you into his glorious presence
innocent of sin and with great joy.
25 All glory to him, who alone is God
our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Yes, glory, majesty, power, and authorityJUDE 1
belong to him, in the beginning, now,
and forevermore. Amen.
7Revela on
1 This is a revela
on from Jesus
Christ, which God gave him
concerning the events that will happen
soon. An angel was sent to God’s servant
John so that John could share the
revela on with God’s other servants.
2 John faithfully reported the word
of God and the tes mony of Jesus
Christ––everything he saw.
3 God blesses the one who reads this
prophecy to the church, and he blesses
all who listen to it and obey what it says.
For the me is near when these things
will happen.
4 This le er is from John to the seven
churches in the province of Asia. Grace
and peace from the one who is, who
always was, and who is s ll to come;
1REVELATION 1
2
from the sevenfold Spirit before his
throne;
5 and from Jesus Christ, who is the
faithful witness to these things, the
ﬁrst to rise from the dead, and the
commander of all the rulers of the
world. All praise to him who loves us and
has freed us from our sins by shedding
his blood for us.
6 He has made us his Kingdom and his
priests who serve before God his Father.
Give to him everlas ng glory! He rules
forever and ever! Amen!
7 Look! He comes with the clouds
of heaven. And everyone will see
him––even those who pierced him. And
all the na ons of the earth will weep
because of him. Yes! Amen!
8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega––the
beginning and the end," says the Lord
God. "I am the one who is, who alwaysREVELATION 1
3
was, and who is s ll to come, the
Almighty One."
9 I am John, your brother. In Jesus
we are partners in suﬀering and in the
Kingdom and in pa ent endurance. I
was exiled to the island of Patmos for
preaching the word of God and speaking
about Jesus.
10 It was the Lord’s Day, and I was
worshiping in the Spirit. Suddenly, I
heard a loud voice behind me, a voice
that sounded like a trumpet blast.
11 It said, "Write down what you see,
and send it to the seven churches:
Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thya ra,
Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."
12 When I turned to see who was
speaking to me, I saw seven gold
lampstands.
13 And standing in the middle of the
lampstands was the Son of Man. He wasREVELATION 1
4
wearing a long robe with a gold sash
across his chest.
14 His head and his hair were white like
wool, as white as snow. And his eyes
were bright like ﬂames of ﬁre.
15 His feet were as bright as bronze
reﬁned in a furnace, and his voice
thundered like mighty ocean waves.
16 He held seven stars in his right hand,
and a sharp two–edged sword came
from his mouth. And his face was as
bright as the sun in all its brilliance.
17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as
dead. But he laid his right hand on me
and said, "Don’t be afraid! I am the First
and the Last.
18 I am the living one who died. Look, I
am alive forever and ever! And I hold the
keys of death and the grave.
19 Write down what you have seen––
both the things that are now happening
and the things that will happen later.REVELATION 1 – 2

20 This is the meaning of the seven
stars you saw in my right hand and the
seven gold lampstands: The seven stars
are the angels of the seven churches,
and the seven lampstands are the seven
churches.
1 "Write this le er to the angel
of the church in Ephesus. This is
the message from the one who holds
the seven stars in his right hand, the
one who walks among the seven gold
lampstands:
2 "I know all the things you do. I have
seen your hard work and your pa ent
endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil
people. You have examined the claims of
those who say they are apostles but are
not. You have discovered they are liars.
3 You have pa ently suﬀered for me
without qui ng.

4 But I have this complaint against you.
You don’t love me or each other as you
did at ﬁrst!
5 Look how far you have fallen from
your ﬁrst love! Turn back to me again
and work as you did at ﬁrst. If you don’t,
I will come and remove your lampstand
from its place among the churches.
6 But there is this about you that is
good: You hate the deeds of the immoral
Nicolaitans, just as I do.
7 "Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen to the Spirit and understand what
the Spirit is saying to the churches.
Everyone who is victorious will eat from
the tree of life in the paradise of God.
8 "Write this le er to the angel of the
church in Smyrna. This is the message
from the one who is the First and the
Last, who died and is alive:
9 "I know about your suﬀering and your
poverty––but you are rich! I know theREVELATION 2

slander of those opposing you. They
say they are Jews, but they really aren’t
because theirs is a synagogue of Satan.
10 Don’t be afraid of what you are about
to suﬀer. The Devil will throw some of
you into prison and put you to the test.
You will be persecuted for ‘ten days.’
Remain faithful even when facing death,
and I will give you the crown of life.

12 "Write this le er to the angel of

located, and yet you have remained
loyal to me. And you refused to deny meREVELATION 2

even when An pas, my faithful witness,
was martyred among you by Satan’s
followers.
14 And yet I have a few complaints
against you. You tolerate some among
you who are like Balaam, who showed
Balak how to trip up the people of
Israel. He taught them to worship idols
by ea ng food oﬀered to idols and by
commi ng sexual sin.
15 In the same way, you have some
Nicolaitans among you––people who
follow the same teaching and commit
the same sins.
16 Repent, or I will come to you
suddenly and ﬁght against them with the
sword of my mouth.
17 "Anyone who is willing to hear should

18 "Write this le er to the angel of the
church in Thya ra. This is the message
from the Son of God, whose eyes are
bright like ﬂames of ﬁre, whose feet are
like polished bronze:
19 "I know all the things you do––your
love, your faith, your service, and your
pa ent endurance. And I can see your
constant improvement in all these
things.
20 But I have this complaint against you.
You are permi ng that woman––that
Jezebel who calls herself a prophet–
–to lead my servants astray. She is
encouraging them to worship idols, eat
food oﬀered to idols, and commit sexual
sin.REVELATION 2
21 I gave her
10
me to repent, but
she would not turn away from her
immorality.
22 Therefore, I will throw her upon a
sickbed, and she will suﬀer greatly with
all who commit adultery with her, unless
they turn away from all their evil deeds.
23 I will strike her children dead. And
all the churches will know that I am the
one who searches out the thoughts and

to each of you whatever you deserve.
24 But I also have a message for the rest
of you in Thya ra who have not followed
this false teaching (‘deeper truths,’ as
they call them––depths of Satan, really).
I will ask nothing more of you

you have un l I come.

I want. I don’t need a thing!’ And you
don’t realize that you are wretched and
miserable and poor and blind and naked.REVELATION 3 – 4
15
18 I advise you to buy gold from

Then you will be rich. And also buy white
garments so you will not be shamed by

your eyes so you will be able to see.

and turn from your indiﬀerence.
20 "Look! Here I stand at the door and

to sit with me on my throne, just as I was
victorious and sat with my Father on his
throne.
22 Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen to the Spirit and understand what
the Spirit is saying to the churches."
1 Then as I looked, I saw a door
standing open in heaven, and the
4REVELATION 4
16
same voice I had heard before spoke to
me with the sound of a mighty trumpet
blast. The voice said, "Come up here,
and I will show you what must happen
a er these things."
2 And instantly I was in the Spirit, and
I saw a throne in heaven and someone
si ng on it!
3 The one si ng on the throne was
as brilliant as gemstones––jasper and
carnelian. And the glow of an emerald
circled his throne like a rainbow.
4 Twenty–four thrones surrounded him,
and twenty–four elders sat on them.
They were all clothed in white and had
gold crowns on their heads.
5 And from the throne came ﬂashes
of lightning and the rumble of thunder.
And in front of the throne were seven
lampstands with burning ﬂames. They
are the seven spirits of God.REVELATION 4
17
6 In front of the throne was a shiny sea
of glass, sparkling like crystal. In the
center and around the throne were four
living beings, each covered with eyes,
front and back.
7 The ﬁrst of these living beings had the
form of a lion; the second looked like
an ox; the third had a human face; and
the fourth had the form of an eagle with
wings spread out as though in ﬂight.
8 Each of these living beings had six
wings, and their wings were covered
with eyes, inside and out. Day a er
day and night a er night they keep on
saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
Almighty––the one who always was,
who is, and who is s ll to come."
9 Whenever the living beings give glory
and honor and thanks to the one si ng
on the throne, the one who lives forever
and ever,REVELATION 4 – 5
18
10 the twenty–four elders fall down and
worship the one who lives forever and
ever. And they lay their crowns before
the throne and say,
11 "You are worthy, O Lord our God,
to receive glory and honor and power.
For you created everything, and it is for
your pleasure that they exist and were
created."
1 And I saw a scroll in the right hand
of the one who was si ng on the
throne. There was wri ng on the inside
and the outside of the scroll, and it was
sealed with seven seals.
2 And I saw a strong angel, who shouted
with a loud voice: "Who is worthy to
break the seals on this scroll and unroll
it?"
3 But no one in heaven or on earth or
under the earth was able to open the
scroll and read it.
5REVELATION 5
19
4 Then I wept because no one could be
found who was worthy to open the scroll
and read it.
5 But one of the twenty–four elders said
to me, "Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of
the tribe of Judah, the heir to David’s
throne, has conquered. He is worthy
to open the scroll and break its seven
seals."
6 I looked and I saw a Lamb that had
been killed but was now standing
between the throne and the four living
beings and among the twenty–four
elders. He had seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven spirits of God
that are sent out into every part of the
earth.
7 He stepped forward and took the
scroll from the right hand of the one
si ng on the throne.
8 And as he took the scroll, the four
living beings and the twenty–four eldersREVELATION 5
20
fell down before the Lamb. Each one
had a harp, and they held gold bowls
ﬁlled with incense––the prayers of God’s
people!
9 And they sang a new song with these
words: "You are worthy to take the
scroll and break its seals and open it.
For you were killed, and your blood has
ransomed people for God from every
tribe and language and people and
na on.
10 And you have caused them to
become God’s Kingdom and his priests.
And they will reign on the earth."
11 Then I looked again, and I heard the
singing of thousands and millions of
angels around the throne and the living
beings and the elders.
12 And they sang in a mighty chorus:
"The Lamb is worthy––the Lamb who
was killed. He is worthy to receive powerREVELATION 5 – 6
21
and riches and wisdom and strength and
honor and glory and blessing."
13 And then I heard every creature in
heaven and on earth and under the
earth and in the sea. They also sang:
"Blessing and honor and glory and power
belong to the one si ng on the throne
and to the Lamb forever and ever."
14 And the four living beings said,
"Amen!" And the twenty–four elders fell
down and worshiped God and the Lamb.
1 As I watched, the Lamb broke
the ﬁrst of the seven seals on the
scroll. Then one of the four living beings
called out with a voice that sounded like
thunder, "Come!"
2 I looked up and saw a white horse. Its
rider carried a bow, and a crown was
placed on his head. He rode out to win
many ba les and gain the victory.
6REVELATION 6
22
3 When the Lamb broke the second
seal, I heard the second living being say,
"Come!"
4 And another horse appeared, a red
one. Its rider was given a mighty sword
and the authority to remove peace
from the earth. And there was war and
slaughter everywhere.
5 When the Lamb broke the third seal, I
heard the third living being say, "Come!"
And I looked up and saw a black horse,
and its rider was holding a pair of scales
in his hand.
6 And a voice from among the four
living beings said, "A loaf of wheat bread
or three loaves of barley for a day’s pay.
And don’t waste the olive oil and wine."
7 And when the Lamb broke the fourth
seal, I heard the fourth living being say,
"Come!"
8 And I looked up and saw a horse
whose color was pale green like a corpse.REVELATION 6
23
And Death was the name of its rider, who
was followed around by the Grave. They
were given authority over one–fourth
of the earth, to kill with the sword and
famine and disease and wild animals.
9 And when the Lamb broke the ﬁ h
seal, I saw under the altar the souls of
all who had been martyred for the word
of God and for being faithful in their
witness.
10 They called loudly to the Lord and
said, "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true,
how long will it be before you judge
the people who belong to this world
for what they have done to us? When
will you avenge our blood against these
people?"
11 Then a white robe was given to each
of them. And they were told to rest
a li le longer un l the full number of
their brothers and sisters ––their fellow
servants of Jesus––had been martyred.REVELATION 6
24
12 I watched as the Lamb broke the sixth
seal, and there was a great earthquake.
The sun became as dark as black cloth,
and the moon became as red as blood.
13 Then the stars of the sky fell to the
earth like green ﬁgs falling from trees
shaken by mighty winds.
14 And the sky was rolled up like a scroll
and taken away. And all of the mountains
and all of the islands disappeared.
15 Then the kings of the earth, the
rulers, the generals, the wealthy people,
the people with great power, and every
slave and every free person––all hid
themselves in the caves and among the
rocks of the mountains.
16 And they cried to the mountains
and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us
from the face of the one who sits on the
throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.
17 For the great day of their wrath has
come, and who will be able to survive?"REVELATION 7
7
25
1 Then I saw four angels standing at
the four corners of the earth, holding
back the four winds from blowing upon
the earth. Not a leaf rustled in the trees,
and the sea became as smooth as glass.
2 And I saw another angel coming from
the east, carrying the seal of the living
God. And he shouted out to those four
angels who had been given power to
injure land and sea,
3 "Wait! Don’t hurt the land or the sea
or the trees un l we have placed the seal
of God on the foreheads of his servants."
4 And I heard how many were marked
with the seal of God. There were 144,000
who were sealed from all the tribes of
Israel:
5 from Judah 12,000; from Reuben
12,000; from Gad 12,000;
6 from Asher 12,000; from Naphtali
12,000; from Manasseh 12,000;REVELATION 7
26
7 from Simeon 12,000; from Levi
12,000; from Issachar 12,000;
8 from Zebulun 12,000; from Joseph
12,000; from Benjamin 12,000.
9 A er this I saw a vast crowd, too great
to count, from every na on and tribe
and people and language, standing in
front of the throne and before the Lamb.
They were clothed in white and held
palm branches in their hands.
10 And they were shou ng with a
mighty shout, "Salva on comes from our
God on the throne and from the Lamb!"
11 And all the angels were standing
around the throne and around the elders
and the four living beings. And they
fell face down before the throne and
worshiped God.
12 They said, "Amen! Blessing and glory
and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor
and power and strength belong to our
God forever and forever. Amen!"REVELATION 7
27
13 Then one of the twenty–four elders
asked me, "Who are these who are
clothed in white? Where do they come
from?"
14 And I said to him, "Sir, you are the
one who knows." Then he said to me,
"These are the ones coming out of the
great tribula on. They washed their
robes in the blood of the Lamb and
made them white.
15 That is why they are standing in front
of the throne of God, serving him day
and night in his Temple. And he who sits
on the throne will live among them and
shelter them.
16 They will never again be hungry or
thirsty, and they will be fully protected
from the scorching noon me heat.
17 For the Lamb who stands in front of
the throne will be their Shepherd. He will
lead them to the springs of life–givingREVELATION 8
28
water. And God will wipe away all their
tears."
1 When the Lamb broke the seventh
seal, there was silence throughout
heaven for about half an hour.
2 And I saw the seven angels who stand
before God, and they were given seven
trumpets.
3 Then another angel with a gold
incense burner came and stood at the
altar. And a great quan ty of incense
was given to him to mix with the prayers
of God’s people, to be oﬀered on the
gold altar before the throne.
4 The smoke of the incense, mixed with
the prayers of the saints, ascended up to
God from the altar where the angel had
poured them out.
5 Then the angel ﬁlled the incense
burner with ﬁre from the altar and threw
it down upon the earth; and thunder
8REVELATION 8
29
crashed, lightning ﬂashed, and there was
a terrible earthquake.
6 Then the seven angels with the seven
trumpets prepared to blow their mighty
blasts.
7 The ﬁrst angel blew his trumpet, and
hail and ﬁre mixed with blood were
thrown down upon the earth, and
one–third of the earth was set on ﬁre.
One–third of the trees were burned, and
all the grass was burned.
8 Then the second angel blew his
trumpet, and a great mountain of ﬁre
was thrown into the sea. And one–third
of the water in the sea became blood.
9 And one–third of all things living in
the sea died. And one–third of all the
ships on the sea were destroyed.
10 Then the third angel blew his
trumpet, and a great ﬂaming star fell
out of the sky, burning like a torch. It fellREVELATION 8 – 9
30
upon one–third of the rivers and on the
springs of water.
11 The name of the star was Bi erness.
It made one–third of the water bi er,
and many people died because the
water was so bi er.
12 Then the fourth angel blew his
trumpet, and one–third of the sun was
struck, and one–third of the moon, and
one–third of the stars, and they became
dark. And one–third of the day was dark
and one–third of the night also.
13 Then I looked up. And I heard a single
eagle crying loudly as it ﬂew through
the air, "Terror, terror, terror to all who
belong to this world because of what
will happen when the last three angels
blow their trumpets."
1 Then the ﬁ h angel blew his
trumpet, and I saw a star that had
fallen to earth from the sky, and he
9REVELATION 9
31
was given the key to the sha of the
bo omless pit.
2 When he opened it, smoke poured
out as though from a huge furnace, and
the sunlight and air were darkened by
the smoke.
3 Then locusts came from the smoke
and descended on the earth, and they
were given power to s ng like scorpions.
4 They were told not to hurt the grass
or plants or trees but to a ack all the
people who did not have the seal of God
on their foreheads.
5 They were told not to kill them but to
torture them for ﬁve months with agony
like the pain of scorpion s ngs.
6 In those days people will seek death
but will not ﬁnd it. They will long to die,
but death will ﬂee away!
7 The locusts looked like horses armed
for ba le. They had gold crowns on their
heads, and they had human faces.REVELATION 9
32
8 Their hair was long like the hair of a
woman, and their teeth were like the
teeth of a lion.
9 They wore armor made of iron, and
their wings roared like an army of
chariots rushing into ba le.
10 They had tails that stung like
scorpions, with power to torture people.
This power was given to them for ﬁve
months.
11 Their king is the angel from the
bo omless pit; his name in Hebrew is
Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon––the
Destroyer.
12 The ﬁrst terror is past, but look, two
more terrors are coming!
13 Then the sixth angel blew his
trumpet, and I heard a voice speaking
from the four horns of the gold altar that
stands in the presence of God.
14 And the voice spoke to the sixth
angel who held the trumpet: "ReleaseREVELATION 9
33
the four angels who are bound at the
great Euphrates River."
15 And the four angels who had been
prepared for this hour and day and
month and year were turned loose to kill
one–third of all the people on earth.
16 They led an army of 200 million
mounted troops––I heard an
announcement of how many there
were.
17 And in my vision, I saw the horses
and the riders si ng on them. The riders
wore armor that was ﬁery red and sky
blue and yellow. The horses’ heads were
like the heads of lions, and ﬁre and
smoke and burning sulfur billowed from
their mouths.
18 One–third of all the people on earth
were killed by these three plagues––by
the ﬁre and the smoke and burning
sulfur that came from the mouths of the
horses.REVELATION 9 – 10
34
19 Their power was in their mouths,
but also in their tails. For their tails had
heads like snakes, with the power to
injure people.
20 But the people who did not die in
these plagues s ll refused to turn from
their evil deeds. They con nued to
worship demons and idols made of gold,
silver, bronze, stone, and wood––idols
that neither see nor hear nor walk!
21 And they did not repent of their
murders or their witchcra or their
immorality or their the s.
1 Then I saw another mighty
angel coming down from heaven,
surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow
over his head. His face shone like the
sun, and his feet were like pillars of ﬁre.
2 And in his hand was a small scroll,
which he had unrolled. He stood with his
right foot on the sea and his le foot on
the land.
10REVELATION 10
35
3 And he gave a great shout, like the
roar of a lion. And when he shouted, the
seven thunders answered.
4 When the seven thunders spoke, I
was about to write. But a voice from
heaven called to me: "Keep secret what
the seven thunders said. Do not write it
down."
5 Then the mighty angel standing on
the sea and on the land li ed his right
hand to heaven.
6 And he swore an oath in the name of
the one who lives forever and ever, who
created heaven and everything in it, the
earth and everything in it, and the sea
and everything in it. He said, "God will
wait no longer.
7 But when the seventh angel blows
his trumpet, God’s mysterious plan
will be fulﬁlled. It will happen just as
he announced it to his servants the
prophets."REVELATION 10 – 11
36
8 Then the voice from heaven called
to me again: "Go and take the unrolled
scroll from the angel who is standing on
the sea and on the land."
9 So I approached him and asked him to
give me the li le scroll. "Yes, take it and
eat it," he said. "At ﬁrst it will taste like
honey, but when you swallow it, it will
make your stomach sour!"
10 So I took the li le scroll from the
hands of the angel, and I ate it! It was
sweet in my mouth, but it made my
stomach sour.
11 Then he said to me, "You must
prophesy again about many peoples,
na ons, languages, and kings."
1 Then I was given a measuring
s ck, and I was told, "Go and
measure the Temple of God and the altar,
and count the number of worshipers.
2 But do not measure the outer
courtyard, for it has been turned over to
11REVELATION 11
37
the na ons. They will trample the holy
city for 42 months.
3 And I will give power to my two
witnesses, and they will be clothed in
sackcloth and will prophesy during those
1,260 days."
4 These two prophets are the two olive
trees and the two lampstands that stand
before the Lord of all the earth.
5 If anyone tries to harm them, ﬁre
ﬂashes from the mouths of the prophets
and consumes their enemies. This is how
anyone who tries to harm them must
die.
6 They have power to shut the skies so
that no rain will fall for as long as they
prophesy. And they have the power to
turn the rivers and oceans into blood,
and to send every kind of plague upon
the earth as o en as they wish.
7 When they complete their tes mony,
the beast that comes up out of theREVELATION 11
38
bo omless pit will declare war against
them. He will conquer them and kill
them.
8 And their bodies will lie in the main
street of Jerusalem, the city which is
called "Sodom" and "Egypt," the city
where their Lord was cruciﬁed.
9 And for three and a half days, all
peoples, tribes, languages, and na ons
will come to stare at their bodies. No
one will be allowed to bury them.
10 All the people who belong to this
world will give presents to each other to
celebrate the death of the two prophets
who had tormented them.
11 But a er three and a half days, the
spirit of life from God entered them, and
they stood up! And terror struck all who
were staring at them.
12 Then a loud voice shouted from
heaven, "Come up here!" And they roseREVELATION 11
39
to heaven in a cloud as their enemies
watched.
13 And in the same hour there was a
terrible earthquake that destroyed a
tenth of the city. Seven thousand people
died in that earthquake. And everyone
who did not die was terriﬁed and gave
glory to the God of heaven.
14 The second terror is past, but look,
now the third terror is coming quickly.
15 Then the seventh angel blew his
trumpet, and there were loud voices
shou ng in heaven: "The whole world
has now become the Kingdom of our
Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign
forever and ever."
16 And the twenty–four elders si ng
on their thrones before God fell on their
faces and worshiped him.
17 And they said, "We give thanks to
you, Lord God Almighty, the one who is
and who always was, for now you haveREVELATION 11 – 12
40
assumed your great power and have
begun to reign.
18 The na ons were angry with you, but
now the me of your wrath has come.
It is me to judge the dead and reward
your servants. You will reward your
prophets and your holy people, all who
fear your name, from the least to the
greatest. And you will destroy all who
have caused destruc on on the earth."
19 Then, in heaven, the Temple of God
was opened and the Ark of his covenant
could be seen inside the Temple.
Lightning ﬂashed, thunder crashed and
roared; there was a great hailstorm,
and the world was shaken by a mighty
earthquake.
1 Then I witnessed in heaven an
event of great signiﬁcance. I saw
a woman clothed with the sun, with the
moon beneath her feet, and a crown of
twelve stars on her head.
12REVELATION 12
41
2 She was pregnant, and she cried out
in the pain of labor as she awaited her
delivery.
3 Suddenly, I witnessed in heaven
another signiﬁcant event. I saw a large
red dragon with seven heads and ten
horns, with seven crowns on his heads.
4 His tail dragged down one–third of
the stars, which he threw to the earth.
He stood before the woman as she was
about to give birth to her child, ready to
devour the baby as soon as it was born.
5 She gave birth to a boy who was to
rule all na ons with an iron rod. And
the child was snatched away from the
dragon and was caught up to God and to
his throne.
6 And the woman ﬂed into the
wilderness, where God had prepared a
place to give her care for 1,260 days.
7 Then there was war in heaven.
Michael and the angels under hisREVELATION 12
42
command fought the dragon and his
angels.
8 And the dragon lost the ba le and
was forced out of heaven.
9 This great dragon––the ancient
serpent called the Devil, or Satan, the
one deceiving the whole world––was
thrown down to the earth with all his
angels.
10 Then I heard a loud voice shou ng
across the heavens, "It has happened
at last––the salva on and power and
kingdom of our God, and the authority
of his Christ! For the Accuser has been
thrown down to earth––the one who
accused our brothers and sisters before
our God day and night.
11 And they have defeated him because
of the blood of the Lamb and because
of their tes mony. And they were not
afraid to die.REVELATION 12
43
12 Rejoice, O heavens! And you who
live in the heavens, rejoice! But terror
will come on the earth and the sea. For
the Devil has come down to you in great
anger, and he knows that he has li le
me."
13 And when the dragon realized that
he had been thrown down to the earth,
he pursued the woman who had given
birth to the child.
14 But she was given two wings like
those of a great eagle. This allowed her
to ﬂy to a place prepared for her in the
wilderness, where she would be cared
for and protected from the dragon for a
me, mes, and half a me.
15 Then the dragon tried to drown the
woman with a ﬂood of water that ﬂowed
from its mouth.
16 But the earth helped her by opening
its mouth and swallowing the riverREVELATION 12 – 13
44
that gushed out from the mouth of the
dragon.
17 Then the dragon became angry at
the woman, and he declared war against
the rest of her children––all who keep
God’s commandments and confess that
they belong to Jesus.
1 (12:18) Then he stood wai ng
on the shore of the sea. (13:1)
And now in my vision I saw a beast rising
up out of the sea. It had seven heads and
ten horns, with ten crowns on its horns.
And wri en on each head were names
that blasphemed God.
2 This beast looked like a leopard, but it
had bear’s feet and a lion’s mouth! And
the dragon gave him his own power and
throne and great authority.
3 I saw that one of the heads of
the beast seemed wounded beyond
recovery––but the fatal wound was
13REVELATION 13
45
healed! All the world marveled at this
miracle and followed the beast in awe.
4 They worshiped the dragon for
giving the beast such power, and they
worshiped the beast. "Is there anyone
as great as the beast?" they exclaimed.
"Who is able to ﬁght against him?"
5 Then the beast was allowed to speak
great blasphemies against God. And
he was given authority to do what he
wanted for forty–two months.
6 And he spoke terrible words of
blasphemy against God, slandering his
name and all who live in heaven, who
are his temple.
7 And the beast was allowed to wage
war against God’s holy people and to
overcome them. And he was given
authority to rule over every tribe and
people and language and na on.
8 And all the people who belong to this
world worshiped the beast. They are theREVELATION 13
46
ones whose names were not wri en in
the Book of Life, which belongs to the
Lamb who was killed before the world
was made.
9 Anyone who is willing to hear should
listen and understand.
10 The people who are des ned for
prison will be arrested and taken away.
Those who are des ned for death will be
killed. But do not be dismayed, for here
is your opportunity to have endurance
and faith.
11 Then I saw another beast come up
out of the earth. He had two horns like
those of a lamb, and he spoke with the
voice of a dragon.
12 He exercised all the authority of
the ﬁrst beast. And he required all the
earth and those who belong to this
world to worship the ﬁrst beast, whose
death–wound had been healed.REVELATION 13
47
13 He did astounding miracles, such as
making ﬁre ﬂash down to earth from
heaven while everyone was watching.
14 And with all the miracles he was
allowed to perform on behalf of the
ﬁrst beast, he deceived all the people
who belong to this world. He ordered
the people of the world to make a great
statue of the ﬁrst beast, who was fatally
wounded and then came back to life.
15 He was permi ed to give life to this
statue so that it could speak. Then the
statue commanded that anyone refusing
to worship it must die.
16 He required everyone––great and
small, rich and poor, slave and free––to
be given a mark on the right hand or on
the forehead.
17 And no one could buy or sell anything
without that mark, which was either
the name of the beast or the number
represen ng his name.REVELATION 13 – 14
48
18 Wisdom is needed to understand
this. Let the one who has understanding
solve the number of the beast, for it is
the number of a man. His number is 666.
1 Then I saw the Lamb standing
on Mount Zion, and with him
were 144,000 who had his name and
his Father’s name wri en on their
foreheads.
2 And I heard a sound from heaven like
the roaring of a great waterfall or the
rolling of mighty thunder. It was like the
sound of many harpists playing together.
3 This great choir sang a wonderful new
song in front of the throne of God and
before the four living beings and the
twenty–four elders. And no one could
learn this song except those 144,000
who had been redeemed from the earth.
4 For they are spiritually undeﬁled, pure
as virgins, following the Lamb wherever
he goes. They have been purchased from
14REVELATION 14
49
among the people on the earth as a
special oﬀering to God and to the Lamb.
5 No falsehood can be charged against
them; they are blameless.
6 And I saw another angel ﬂying through
the heavens, carrying the everlas ng
Good News to preach to the people who
belong to this world––to every na on,
tribe, language, and people.
7 "Fear God," he shouted. "Give glory
to him. For the me has come when he
will sit as judge. Worship him who made
heaven and earth, the sea, and all the
springs of water."
8 Then another angel followed him
through the skies, shou ng, "Babylon is
fallen––that great city is fallen––because
she seduced the na ons of the world
and made them drink the wine of her
passionate immorality."
9 Then a third angel followed them,
shou ng, "Anyone who worships theREVELATION 14
50
beast and his statue or who accepts his
mark on the forehead or the hand
10 must drink the wine of God’s wrath. It
is poured out undiluted into God’s cup of
wrath. And they will be tormented with
ﬁre and burning sulfur in the presence of
the holy angels and the Lamb.
11 The smoke of their torment rises
forever and ever, and they will have
no relief day or night, for they have
worshiped the beast and his statue and
have accepted the mark of his name.
12 Let this encourage God’s holy people
to endure persecu on pa ently and
remain ﬁrm to the end, obeying his
commands and trus ng in Jesus."
13 And I heard a voice from heaven
saying, "Write this down: Blessed are
those who die in the Lord from now
on. Yes, says the Spirit, they are blessed
indeed, for they will rest from all theirREVELATION 14
51
toils and trials; for their good deeds
follow them!"
14 Then I saw the Son of Man si ng on
a white cloud. He had a gold crown on
his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
15 Then an angel came from the Temple
and called out in a loud voice to the one
si ng on the cloud, "Use the sickle, for
the me has come for you to harvest;
the crop is ripe on the earth."
16 So the one si ng on the cloud swung
his sickle over the earth, and the whole
earth was harvested.
17 A er that, another angel came from
the Temple in heaven, and he also had a
sharp sickle.
18 Then another angel, who has power
to destroy the world with ﬁre, shouted
to the angel with the sickle, "Use your
sickle now to gather the clusters of
grapes from the vines of the earth, for
they are fully ripe for judgment."REVELATION 14 – 15
52
19 So the angel swung his sickle on the
earth and loaded the grapes into the
great winepress of God’s wrath.
20 And the grapes were trodden in the
winepress outside the city, and blood
ﬂowed from the winepress in a stream
about 180 miles long and as high as a
horse’s bridle.
1 Then I saw in heaven another
signiﬁcant event, and it was
great and marvelous. Seven angels were
holding the seven last plagues, which
would bring God’s wrath to comple on.
2 I saw before me what seemed to be
a crystal sea mixed with ﬁre. And on
it stood all the people who had been
victorious over the beast and his statue
and the number represen ng his name.
They were all holding harps that God
had given them.
3 And they were singing the song of
Moses, the servant of God, and the song
15REVELATION 15
53
of the Lamb: "Great and marvelous are
your ac ons, Lord God Almighty. Just
and true are your ways, O King of the
na ons.
4 Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify
your name? For you alone are holy. All
na ons will come and worship before
you, for your righteous deeds have been
revealed."
5 Then I looked and saw that the Temple
in heaven, God’s Tabernacle, was thrown
wide open!
6 The seven angels who were holding
the bowls of the seven plagues came
from the Temple, clothed in spotless
white linen with gold belts across their
chests.
7 And one of the four living beings
handed each of the seven angels a gold
bowl ﬁlled with the terrible wrath of
God, who lives forever and forever.REVELATION 15 – 16
54
8 The Temple was ﬁlled with smoke
from God’s glory and power. No one
could enter the Temple un l the seven
angels had completed pouring out the
seven plagues.
1 Then I heard a mighty voice
shou ng from the Temple to the
seven angels, "Now go your ways and
empty out the seven bowls of God’s
wrath on the earth."
2 So the ﬁrst angel le the Temple and
poured out his bowl over the earth, and
horrible, malignant sores broke out on
everyone who had the mark of the beast
and who worshiped his statue.
3 Then the second angel poured out his
bowl on the sea, and it became like the
blood of a corpse. And everything in the
sea died.
4 Then the third angel poured out his
bowl on the rivers and springs, and they
became blood.
16REVELATION 16
55
5 And I heard the angel who had
authority over all water saying, "You are
just in sending this judgment, O Holy
One, who is and who always was.
6 For your holy people and your
prophets have been killed, and their
blood was poured out on the earth. So
you have given their murderers blood to
drink. It is their just reward."
7 And I heard a voice from the altar
saying, "Yes, Lord God Almighty, your
punishments are true and just."
8 Then the fourth angel poured out his
bowl on the sun, causing it to scorch
everyone with its ﬁre.
9 Everyone was burned by this blast of
heat, and they cursed the name of God,
who sent all of these plagues. They did
not repent and give him glory.
10 Then the ﬁ h angel poured out his
bowl on the throne of the beast, and
his kingdom was plunged into darkness.REVELATION 16
56
And his subjects ground their teeth in
anguish,
11 and they cursed the God of heaven
for their pains and sores. But they
refused to repent of all their evil deeds.
12 Then the sixth angel poured out his
bowl on the great Euphrates River, and
it dried up so that the kings from the
east could march their armies westward
without hindrance.
13 And I saw three evil spirits that
looked like frogs leap from the mouth
of the dragon, the beast, and the false
prophet.
14 These miracle–working demons
caused all the rulers of the world to
gather for ba le against the Lord on that
great judgment day of God Almighty.
15 "Take note: I will come as
unexpectedly as a thief! Blessed
are all who are watching for me, whoREVELATION 16
57
keep their robes ready so they will not
need to walk naked and ashamed."
16 And they gathered all the rulers
and their armies to a place called
Armageddon in Hebrew.
17 Then the seventh angel poured out
his bowl into the air. And a mighty shout
came from the throne of the Temple in
heaven, saying, "It is ﬁnished!"
18 Then the thunder crashed and rolled,
and lightning ﬂashed. And there was an
earthquake greater than ever before in
human history.
19 The great city of Babylon split into
three pieces, and ci es around the world
fell into heaps of rubble. And so God
remembered all of Babylon’s sins, and
he made her drink the cup that was ﬁlled
with the wine of his ﬁerce wrath.
20 And every island disappeared, and all
the mountains were leveled.REVELATION 16 – 17
58
21 There was a terrible hailstorm,
and hailstones weighing seventy–ﬁve
pounds fell from the sky onto the people
below. They cursed God because of the
hailstorm, which was a very terrible
plague.
1 One of the seven angels who
had poured out the seven bowls
came over and spoke to me. "Come
with me," he said, "and I will show you
the judgment that is going to come on
the great pros tute, who sits on many
waters.
2 The rulers of the world have had
immoral rela ons with her, and the
people who belong to this world have
been made drunk by the wine of her
immorality."
3 So the angel took me in spirit into the
wilderness. There I saw a woman si ng
on a scarlet beast that had seven heads
17REVELATION 17
59
and ten horns, wri en all over with
blasphemies against God.
4 The woman wore purple and scarlet
clothing and beau ful jewelry made of
gold and precious gems and pearls. She
held in her hand a gold goblet full of
obsceni es and the impuri es of her
immorality.
5 A mysterious name was wri en on her
forehead: "Babylon the Great, Mother
of All Pros tutes and Obsceni es in the
World."
6 I could see that she was drunk––drunk
with the blood of God’s holy people who
were witnesses for Jesus. I stared at her
completely amazed.
7 "Why are you so amazed?" the angel
asked. "I will tell you the mystery of this
woman and of the beast with seven
heads and ten horns.
8 The beast you saw was alive but isn’t
now. And yet he will soon come up outREVELATION 17
60
of the bo omless pit and go to eternal
destruc on. And the people who belong
to this world, whose names were not
wri en in the Book of Life from before
the world began, will be amazed at the
reappearance of this beast who had
died.
9 "And now understand this: The seven
heads of the beast represent the seven
hills of the city where this woman rules.
They also represent seven kings.
10 Five kings have already fallen, the
sixth now reigns, and the seventh is yet
to come, but his reign will be brief.
11 The scarlet beast that was alive and
then died is the eighth king. He is like
the other seven, and he, too, will go to
his doom.
12 His ten horns are ten kings who
have not yet risen to power; they will
be appointed to their kingdoms for one
brief moment to reign with the beast.REVELATION 17
61
13 They will all agree to give their power
and authority to him.
14 Together they will wage war against
the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them
because he is Lord over all lords and King
over all kings, and his people are the
called and chosen and faithful ones."
15 And the angel said to me, "The
waters where the pros tute is si ng
represent masses of people of every
na on and language.
16 The scarlet beast and his ten horns––
which represent ten kings who will reign
with him––all hate the pros tute. They
will strip her naked, eat her ﬂesh, and
burn her remains with ﬁre.
17 For God has put a plan into their
minds, a plan that will carry out his
purposes. They will mutually agree to
give their authority to the scarlet beast,
and so the words of God will be fulﬁlled.REVELATION 17 – 18
62
18 And this woman you saw in your
vision represents the great city that rules
over the kings of the earth."
1 A er all this I saw another angel
come down from heaven with
great authority, and the earth grew
bright with his splendor.
2 He gave a mighty shout, "Babylon is
fallen––that great city is fallen! She has
become the hideout of demons and evil
spirits, a nest for ﬁlthy buzzards, and a
den for dreadful beasts.
3 For all the na ons have drunk the wine
of her passionate immorality. The rulers
of the world have commi ed adultery
with her, and merchants throughout the
world have grown rich as a result of her
luxurious living."
4 Then I heard another voice calling
from heaven, "Come away from her, my
people. Do not take part in her sins, or
you will be punished with her.
18REVELATION 18
63
5 For her sins are piled as high as
heaven, and God is ready to judge her
for her evil deeds.
6 Do to her as she has done to your
people. Give her a double penalty for
all her evil deeds. She brewed a cup of
terror for others, so give her twice as
much as she gave out.
7 She has lived in luxury and pleasure,
so match it now with torments and
sorrows. She boasts, ‘I am queen on my
throne. I am no helpless widow. I will not
experience sorrow.’
8 Therefore, the sorrows of death and
mourning and famine will overtake
her in a single day. She will be u erly
consumed by ﬁre, for the Lord God who
judges her is mighty."
9 And the rulers of the world who took
part in her immoral acts and enjoyed her
great luxury will mourn for her as theyREVELATION 18
64
see the smoke rising from her charred
remains.
10 They will stand at a distance, terriﬁed
by her great torment. They will cry out,
"How terrible, how terrible for Babylon,
that great city! In one single moment
God’s judgment came on her."
11 The merchants of the world will
weep and mourn for her, for there is no
one le to buy their goods.
12 She bought great quan es of gold,
silver, jewels, pearls, ﬁne linen, purple
dye, silk, scarlet cloth, every kind of
perfumed wood, ivory goods, objects
made of expensive wood, bronze, iron,
and marble.
13 She also bought cinnamon, spice,
incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine,
olive oil, ﬁne ﬂour, wheat, ca le, sheep,
horses, chariots, and slaves––yes, she
even traded in human lives.REVELATION 18
65
14 "All the fancy things you loved so
much are gone," they cry. "The luxuries
and splendor that you prized so much
will never be yours again. They are gone
forever."
15 The merchants who became wealthy
by selling her these things will stand at a
distance, terriﬁed by her great torment.
They will weep and cry.
16 "How terrible, how terrible for that
great city! She was so beau ful––like
a woman clothed in ﬁnest purple and
scarlet linens, decked out with gold and
precious stones and pearls!
17 And in one single moment all the
wealth of the city is gone!" And all
the shipowners and captains of the
merchant ships and their crews will
stand at a distance.
18 They will weep as they watch the
smoke ascend, and they will say, "WhereREVELATION 18
66
in all the world is there another city like
this?"
19 And they will throw dust on their
heads to show their great sorrow. And
they will say, "How terrible, how terrible
for the great city! She made us all rich
from her great wealth. And now in a
single hour it is all gone."
20 But you, O heaven, rejoice over her
fate. And you also rejoice, O holy people
of God and apostles and prophets! For at
last God has judged her on your behalf.
21 Then a mighty angel picked up a
boulder as large as a great millstone. He
threw it into the ocean and shouted,
"Babylon, the great city, will be thrown
down as violently as I have thrown
away this stone, and she will disappear
forever.
22 Never again will the sound of music
be heard there––no more harps, songs,
ﬂutes, or trumpets. There will be noREVELATION 18 – 19
67
industry of any kind, and no more milling
of grain.
23 Her nights will be dark, without a
single lamp. There will be no happy
voices of brides and grooms. This will
happen because her merchants, who
were the greatest in the world, deceived
the na ons with her sorceries.
24 In her streets the blood of the
prophets was spilled. She was the one
who slaughtered God’s people all over
the world."
1 A er this, I heard the sound of
a vast crowd in heaven shou ng,
"Hallelujah! Salva on is from our God.
Glory and power belong to him alone.
2 His judgments are just and true. He
has punished the great pros tute who
corrupted the earth with her immorality,
and he has avenged the murder of his
servants."
19REVELATION 19
68
3 Again and again their voices rang,
"Hallelujah! The smoke from that city
ascends forever and forever!"
4 Then the twenty–four elders and
the four living beings fell down and
worshiped God, who was si ng on
the throne. They cried out, "Amen!
Hallelujah!"
5 And from the throne came a voice that
said, "Praise our God, all his servants,
from the least to the greatest, all who
fear him."
6 Then I heard again what sounded like
the shout of a huge crowd, or the roar
of mighty ocean waves, or the crash of
loud thunder: "Hallelujah! For the Lord
our God, the Almighty, reigns.
7 Let us be glad and rejoice and honor
him. For the me has come for the
wedding feast of the Lamb, and his bride
has prepared herself.REVELATION 19
8 She is permi
69
ed to wear the ﬁnest
white linen." (Fine linen represents the
good deeds done by the people of God.)
9 And the angel said, "Write this:
Blessed are those who are invited to
the wedding feast of the Lamb." And he
added, "These are true words that come
from God."
10 Then I fell down at his feet to worship
him, but he said, "No, don’t worship
me. For I am a servant of God, just like
you and other brothers and sisters who
tes fy of their faith in Jesus. Worship
God. For the essence of prophecy is to
give a clear witness for Jesus."
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a
white horse was standing there. And
the one si ng on the horse was named
Faithful and True. For he judges fairly
and then goes to war.
12 His eyes were bright like ﬂames of
ﬁre, and on his head were many crowns.REVELATION 19
70
A name was wri en on him, and only he
knew what it meant.
13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in
blood, and his tle was the Word of God.
14 The armies of heaven, dressed in
pure white linen, followed him on white
horses.
15 From his mouth came a sharp sword,
and with it he struck down the na ons.
He ruled them with an iron rod, and he
trod the winepress of the ﬁerce wrath of
almighty God.
16 On his robe and thigh was wri en
this tle: King of kings and Lord of lords.
17 Then I saw an angel standing in the
sun, shou ng to the vultures ﬂying high
in the sky: "Come! Gather together for
the great banquet God has prepared.
18 Come and eat the ﬂesh of kings,
captains, and strong warriors; of horses
and their riders; and of all humanity,
both free and slave, small and great."REVELATION 19 – 20
71
19 Then I saw the beast gathering the
kings of the earth and their armies in
order to ﬁght against the one si ng on
the horse and his army.
20 And the beast was captured, and
with him the false prophet who did
mighty miracles on behalf of the
beast––miracles that deceived all who
had accepted the mark of the beast
and who worshiped his statue. Both the
beast and his false prophet were thrown
alive into the lake of ﬁre that burns with
sulfur.
21 Their en re army was killed by
the sharp sword that came out of the
mouth of the one riding the white horse.
And all the vultures of the sky gorged
themselves on the dead bodies.
1 Then I saw an angel come down
from heaven with the key to the
bo omless pit and a heavy chain in his
hand.
20REVELATION 20
72
2 He seized the dragon––that old
serpent, the Devil, Satan––and bound
him in chains for a thousand years.
3 The angel threw him into the
bo omless pit, which he then shut and
locked so Satan could not deceive the
na ons anymore un l the thousand
years were ﬁnished. A erward he would
be released again for a li le while.
4 Then I saw thrones, and the people
si ng on them had been given the
authority to judge. And I saw the souls of
those who had been beheaded for their
tes mony about Jesus, for proclaiming
the word of God. And I saw the souls of
those who had not worshiped the beast
or his statue, nor accepted his mark
on their forehead or their hands. They
came to life again, and they reigned with
Christ for a thousand years.REVELATION 20
5 This is the ﬁrst resurrec
73
on. (The rest
of the dead did not come back to life
un l the thousand years had ended.)
6 Blessed and holy are those who share
in the ﬁrst resurrec on. For them the
second death holds no power, but they
will be priests of God and of Christ and
will reign with him a thousand years.
7 When the thousand years end, Satan
will be let out of his prison.
8 He will go out to deceive the na ons
from every corner of the earth, which
are called Gog and Magog. He will gather
them together for ba le––a mighty host,
as numberless as sand along the shore.
9 And I saw them as they went up on the
broad plain of the earth and surrounded
God’s people and the beloved city. But
ﬁre from heaven came down on the
a acking armies and consumed them.
10 Then the Devil, who betrayed them,
was thrown into the lake of ﬁre thatREVELATION 20

burns with sulfur, joining the beast and
the false prophet. There they will be
tormented day and night forever and
ever.
11 And I saw a great white throne, and
I saw the one who was si ng on it. The
earth and sky ﬂed from his presence, but
they found no place to hide.
12 I saw the dead, both great and small,
standing before God’s throne. And
the books were opened, including the
Book of Life. And the dead were judged
according to the things wri en in the
books, according to what they had done.
13 The sea gave up the dead in it, and
death and the grave gave up the dead in
them. They were all judged according to
their deeds.
14 And death and the grave were
thrown into the lake of ﬁre. This is the
second death––the lake of ﬁre.REVELATION 20 – 21
75
15 And anyone whose name was not
found recorded in the Book of Life was
thrown into the lake of ﬁre.
1 Then I saw a new heaven and
a new earth, for the old heaven
and the old earth had disappeared. And
the sea was also gone.
2 And I saw the holy city, the new
Jerusalem, coming down from God out
of heaven like a beau ful bride prepared
for her husband.
3 I heard a loud shout from the throne,
saying, "Look, the home of God is now
among his people! He will live with
them, and they will be his people. God
himself will be with them.
4 He will remove all of their sorrows,
and there will be no more death or
sorrow or crying or pain. For the old
world and its evils are gone forever."
5 And the one si ng on the throne said,
"Look, I am making all things new!" And
21REVELATION 21
76
then he said to me, "Write this down, for
what I tell you is trustworthy and true."
6 And he also said, "It is ﬁnished! I
am the Alpha and the Omega––the
Beginning and the End. To all who are
thirsty I will give the springs of the water
of life without charge!
7 All who are victorious will inherit all
these blessings, and I will be their God,
and they will be my children.
8 But cowards who turn away from
me, and unbelievers, and the corrupt,
and murderers, and the immoral, and
those who prac ce witchcra , and idol
worshipers, and all liars––their doom
is in the lake that burns with ﬁre and
sulfur. This is the second death."
9 Then one of the seven angels who
held the seven bowls containing the
seven last plagues came and said to me,
"Come with me! I will show you the
bride, the wife of the Lamb."REVELATION 21
77
10 So he took me in spirit to a great,
high mountain, and he showed me the
holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of
heaven from God.
11 It was ﬁlled with the glory of God
and sparkled like a precious gem, crystal
clear like jasper.
12 Its walls were broad and high, with
twelve gates guarded by twelve angels.
And the names of the twelve tribes of
Israel were wri en on the gates.
13 There were three gates on each
side––east, north, south, and west.
14 The wall of the city had twelve
founda on stones, and on them were
wri en the names of the twelve apostles
of the Lamb.
15 The angel who talked to me held
in his hand a gold measuring s ck to
measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
16 When he measured it, he found it
was a square, as wide as it was long. InREVELATION 21
78
fact, it was in the form of a cube, for its
length and width and height were each
1,400 miles.
17 Then he measured the walls and
found them to be 216 feet thick (the
angel used a standard human measure).
18 The wall was made of jasper, and the
city was pure gold, as clear as glass.
19 The wall of the city was built on
founda on stones inlaid with twelve
gems: the ﬁrst was jasper, the second
sapphire, the third agate, the fourth
emerald,
20 the ﬁ h onyx, the sixth carnelian, the
seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the
ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the
eleventh jacinth, the twel h amethyst.
21 The twelve gates were made of
pearls––each gate from a single pearl!
And the main street was pure gold, as
clear as glass.REVELATION 21 – 22
79
22 No temple could be seen in the city,
for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb
are its temple.
23 And the city has no need of sun or
moon, for the glory of God illuminates
the city, and the Lamb is its light.
24 The na ons of the earth will walk in
its light, and the rulers of the world will
come and bring their glory to it.
25 Its gates never close at the end of day
because there is no night.
26 And all the na ons will bring their
glory and honor into the city.
27 Nothing evil will be allowed to
enter––no one who prac ces shameful
idolatry and dishonesty––but only those
whose names are wri en in the Lamb’s
Book of Life.
1 And the angel showed me a
pure river with the water of life,
clear as crystal, ﬂowing from the throne
of God and of the Lamb,
22REVELATION 22
80
2 coursing down the center of the main
street. On each side of the river grew
a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of
fruit, with a fresh crop each month. The
leaves were used for medicine to heal
the na ons.
3 No longer will anything be cursed. For
the throne of God and of the Lamb will
be there, and his servants will worship
him.
4 And they will see his face, and his
name will be wri en on their foreheads.
5 And there will be no night there––no
need for lamps or sun––for the Lord God
will shine on them. And they will reign
forever and ever.
6 Then the angel said to me, "These
words are trustworthy and true: ‘The
Lord God, who tells his prophets what
the future holds, has sent his angel to
tell you what will happen soon.’"REVELATION 22
81
7 "Look, I am coming soon! Blessed are
those who obey the prophecy wri en in
this scroll."
8 I, John, am the one who saw and
heard all these things. And when I saw
and heard these things, I fell down to
worship the angel who showed them to
me.
9 But again he said, "No, don’t worship
me. I am a servant of God, just like you
and your brothers the prophets, as well
as all who obey what is wri en in this
scroll. Worship God!"
10 Then he instructed me, "Do not
seal up the prophe c words you have
wri en, for the me is near.
11 Let the one who is doing wrong
con nue to do wrong; the one who is
vile, con nue to be vile; the one who is
good, con nue to do good; and the one
who is holy, con nue in holiness."REVELATION 22
82
12 "See, I am coming soon, and my
reward is with me, to repay all according
to their deeds.
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
First and the Last, the Beginning and the
End."
14 Blessed are those who wash their
robes so they can enter through the
gates of the city and eat the fruit from
the tree of life.
15 Outside the city are the dogs––the
sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the
murderers, the idol worshipers, and all
who love to live a lie.
16 "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give
you this message for the churches. I am
both the source of David and the heir to
his throne. I am the bright morning star."
17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come."
Let each one who hears them say,
"Come." Let the thirsty ones come––
anyone who wants to. Let them comeREVELATION 22

and drink the water of life without
charge.
18 And I solemnly declare to everyone
who hears the prophe c words of this
book: If anyone adds anything to what is
wri en here, God will add to that person
the plagues described in this book.
19 And if anyone removes any of the
words of this prophe c book, God will
remove that person’s share in the tree
of life and in the holy city that are
described in this book.
20 He who is the faithful witness to
all these things says, "Yes, I am coming
soon!" Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with
you all.
