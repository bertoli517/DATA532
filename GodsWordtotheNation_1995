Mathew
1
1 This is the list of ancestors of Jesus
Christ, descendant of David and
Abraham.
2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac
the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of
Judah and his brothers.
3 Judah and Tamar were the father and
mother of Perez and Zerah. Perez was
the father of Hezron, Hezron the father
of Ram,
4 Ram the father of Amminadab,
Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
Nahshon the father of Salmon.
5 Salmon and Rahab were the father
and mother of Boaz. Boaz and Ruth were
the father and mother of Obed. Obed
was the father of Jesse,MATTHEW 1
2
6 Jesse the father of King David. David
and Uriah’s wife Bathsheba were the
father and mother of Solomon.
7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam,
Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah
the father of Asa,
8 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat,
Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram
the father of Uzziah,
9 Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham
the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of
Hezekiah,
10 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh,
Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon
the father of Josiah.
11 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah
and his brothers. They lived at the me
when the people were exiled to Babylon.
12 A er the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah
became the father of Sheal el. Sheal el
was the father of Zerubbabel,MATTHEW 1
3
13 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud,
Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the
father of Azor,
14 Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the
father of Achim, Achim the father of
Eliud,
15 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar
the father of Ma han, Ma han the
father of Jacob.
16 Jacob was the father of Joseph, who
was the husband of Mary. Mary was the
mother of Jesus, who is called Christ.
17 So there were 14 genera ons from
Abraham to David, 14 genera ons from
David un l the exile to Babylon, 14
genera ons from the exile un l the
Messiah.
18 The birth of Jesus Christ took place
in this way. His mother Mary had been
promised to Joseph in marriage. But
before they were married, Mary realized
that she was pregnant by the Holy Spirit.MATTHEW 1
4
19 Her husband Joseph was an
honorable man and did not want to
disgrace her publicly. So he decided to
break the marriage agreement with her
secretly.
20 Joseph had this in mind when an
angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
dream. The angel said to him, "Joseph,
descendant of David, don’t be afraid to
take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant
by the Holy Spirit.
21 She will give birth to a son, and you
will name him Jesus [He Saves], because
he will save his people from their sins."
22 All this happened so that what the
Lord had spoken through the prophet
came true:
23 "The virgin will become pregnant and
give birth to a son, and they will name
him Immanuel," which means "God is
with us."MATTHEW 1 – 2
5
24 When Joseph woke up, he did what
the angel of the Lord had commanded
him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.
25 He did not have marital rela ons
with her before she gave birth to a son.
Joseph named the child Jesus.
1 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in
Judea when Herod was king. A er
Jesus’ birth wise men from the east
arrived in Jerusalem.
2 They asked, "Where is the one who
was born to be the king of the Jews?
We saw his star rising and have come to
worship him."
3 When King Herod and all Jerusalem
heard about this, they became disturbed.
4 He called together all the chief priests
and scribes and tried to ﬁnd out from
them where the Messiah was supposed
to be born.
5 They told him, "In Bethlehem in Judea.
The prophet wrote about this:
2MATTHEW 2
6
6 Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you
are by no means least among the leaders
of Judah. A leader will come from you.
He will shepherd my people Israel."
7 Then Herod secretly called the wise
men and found out from them exactly
when the star had appeared.
8 As he sent them to Bethlehem, he
said, "Go and search carefully for the
child. When you have found him, report
to me so that I may go and worship him
too."
9 A er they had heard the king, they
started out. The star they had seen rising
led them un l it stopped over the place
where the child was.
10 They were overwhelmed with joy to
see the star.
11 When they entered the house, they
saw the child with his mother Mary.
So they bowed down and worshiped
him. Then they opened their treasureMATTHEW 2
7
chests and oﬀered him gi s of gold,
frankincense, and myrrh.
12 God warned them in a dream not to
go back to Herod. So they le for their
country by another road.
13 A er they had le , an angel of the
Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.
The angel said to him, "Get up, take the
child and his mother, and ﬂee to Egypt.
Stay there un l I tell you, because Herod
intends to search for the child and kill
him."
14 Joseph got up, took the child and his
mother, and le for Egypt that night.
15 He stayed there un l Herod died.
What the Lord had spoken through the
prophet came true: "I have called my
son out of Egypt."
16 When Herod saw that the wise men
had tricked him, he became furious. He
sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years
old and younger in or near Bethlehem.MATTHEW 2
8
This matched the exact me he had
learned from the wise men.
17 Then the words spoken through the
prophet Jeremiah came true:
18 "A sound was heard in Ramah, the
sound of crying in bi er grief. Rachel was
crying for her children. She refused to be
comforted because they were dead."
19 A er Herod was dead, an angel of
the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph
in Egypt.
20 The angel said to him, "Get up, take
the child and his mother, and go to
Israel. Those who tried to kill the child
are dead."
21 Joseph got up, took the child and his
mother, and went to Israel.
22 But when he heard that Archelaus
had succeeded his father Herod as king
of Judea, Joseph was afraid to go there.
Warned in a dream, he le for GalileeMATTHEW 2 – 3
9
23 and made his home in a city called
Nazareth. So what the prophets had
said came true: "He will be called a
Nazarene."
1 Later, John the Bap zer appeared
in the desert of Judea. His message
was,
2 "Turn to God and change the way you
think and act, because the kingdom of
heaven is near."
3 Isaiah the prophet spoke about this
man when he said, "A voice cries out
in the desert: ‘Prepare the way for the
Lord! Make his paths straight!’"
4 John wore clothes made from camel’s
hair and had a leather belt around his
waist. His diet consisted of locusts and
wild honey.
5 Jerusalem, all Judea, and the whole
Jordan Valley went to him.
6 As they confessed their sins, he
bap zed them in the Jordan River.
3MATTHEW 3
10
7 But when he saw many Pharisees and
Sadducees coming to be bap zed, he
said to them, "You poisonous snakes!
Who showed you how to ﬂee from God’s
coming anger?
8 Do those things that prove you have
turned to God and have changed the
way you think and act.
9 Don’t think you can say, ‘Abraham is
our ancestor.’ I can guarantee that God
can raise up descendants for Abraham
from these stones.
10 The ax is now ready to cut the roots
of the trees. Any tree that doesn’t
produce good fruit will be cut down and
thrown into a ﬁre.
11 I bap ze you with water so that you
will change the way you think and act.
But the one who comes a er me is more
powerful than I. I am not worthy to
remove his sandals. He will bap ze you
with the Holy Spirit and ﬁre.MATTHEW 3
11
12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand,
and he will clean up his threshing ﬂoor.
He will gather his wheat into a barn, but
he will burn the husks in a ﬁre that can
never be put out."
13 Then Jesus appeared. He came from
Galilee to the Jordan River to be bap zed
by John.
14 But John tried to stop him and said,
"I need to be bap zed by you. Why are
you coming to me?"
15 Jesus answered him, "This is the way
it has to be now. This is the proper way
to do everything that God requires of
us." Then John gave in to him.
16 A er Jesus was bap zed, he
immediately came up from the water.
Suddenly, the heavens were opened,
and he saw the Spirit of God coming
down as a dove to him.MATTHEW 3 – 4
12
17 Then a voice from heaven said, "This
is my Son, whom I love––my Son with
whom I am pleased."
1 Then the Spirit led Jesus into the
desert to be tempted by the devil.
2 Jesus did not eat anything for 40 days
and 40 nights. At the end of that me,
he was hungry.
3 The tempter came to him and said, "If
you are the Son of God, tell these stones
to become loaves of bread."
4 Jesus answered, "Scripture says, ‘A
person cannot live on bread alone but
on every word that God speaks.’"
5 Then the devil took him into the holy
city and had him stand on the highest
part of the temple.
6 He said to Jesus, "If you are the Son
of God, jump! Scripture says, ‘He will
put his angels in charge of you. They
will carry you in their hands so that you
never hit your foot against a rock.’"
4MATTHEW 4
13
7 Jesus said to him, "Again, Scripture
says, ‘Never tempt the Lord your God.’"
8 Once more the devil took him to a
very high mountain and showed him
all the kingdoms in the world and their
glory.
9 The devil said to him, "I will give you
all this if you will bow down and worship
me."
10 Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan!
Scripture says, ‘Worship the Lord your
God and serve only him.’"
11 Then the devil le him, and angels
came to take care of him.
12 When Jesus heard that John had
been put in prison, he went back to
Galilee.
13 He le Nazareth and made his home
in Capernaum on the shores of the Sea
of Galilee. This was in the region of
Zebulun and Naphtali.MATTHEW 4
14
14 So what the prophet Isaiah had said
came true:
15 "Land of Zebulun and land of
Naphtali, on the way to the sea,
across the Jordan River, Galilee, where
foreigners live!
16 The people who lived in darkness
have seen a bright light. A light has
risen for those who live in a land
overshadowed by death."
17 From then on, Jesus began to tell
people, "Turn to God and change the
way you think and act, because the
kingdom of heaven is near!"
18 As he was walking along the Sea of
Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon
(called Peter) and Andrew. They were
throwing a net into the sea because they
were ﬁshermen.
19 Jesus said to them, "Come, follow
me! I will teach you how to catch people
instead of ﬁsh."MATTHEW 4
20 They immediately le
15
their nets and
followed him.
21 As Jesus went on, he saw two other
brothers, James and John, the sons of
Zebedee. They were in a boat with their
father Zebedee preparing their nets to
go ﬁshing. He called them,
22 and they immediately le the boat
and their father and followed Jesus.
23 Jesus went all over Galilee. He taught
in the synagogues and spread the Good
News of the kingdom. He also cured
every disease and sickness among the
people.
24 The news about Jesus spread
throughout Syria. People brought him
everyone who was sick, those who
suﬀered from any kind of disease or
pain. They also brought epilep cs,
those who were paralyzed, and people
possessed by demons, and he cured
them all.MATTHEW 4 – 5
16
25 Large crowds followed him. They
came from Galilee, the Ten Ci es,
Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the
Jordan River.
1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he
went up a mountain and sat down.
His disciples came to him,
2 and he began to teach them:
3 "Blessed are those who recognize they
are spiritually helpless. The kingdom of
heaven belongs to them.
4 Blessed are those who mourn. They
will be comforted.
5 Blessed are those who are gentle.
They will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for God’s approval. They will be
sa sﬁed.
7 Blessed are those who show mercy.
They will be treated mercifully.
8 Blessed are those whose thoughts are
pure. They will see God.
5MATTHEW 5
17
9 Blessed are those who make peace.
They will be called God’s children.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted
for doing what God approves of. The
kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
11 "Blessed are you when people insult
you, persecute you, lie, and say all kinds
of evil things about you because of me.
12 Rejoice and be glad because you have
a great reward in heaven! The prophets
who lived before you were persecuted in
these ways.
13 "You are salt for the earth. But if salt
loses its taste, how will it be made salty
again? It is no longer good for anything
except to be thrown out and trampled
on by people.
14 "You are light for the world. A city
cannot be hidden when it is located on a
hill.
15 No one lights a lamp and puts it
under a basket. Instead, everyone whoMATTHEW 5
18
lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand.
Then its light shines on everyone in the
house.
16 In the same way let your light shine
in front of people. Then they will see the
good that you do and praise your Father
in heaven.
17 "Don’t ever think that I came to set
aside Moses’ Teachings or the Prophets.
I didn’t come to set them aside but to
make them come true.
18 I can guarantee this truth: Un l
the earth and the heavens disappear,
neither a period nor a comma will
disappear from Moses’ Teachings before
everything has come true.
19 So whoever sets aside any command
that seems unimportant and teaches
others to do the same will be
unimportant in the kingdom of heaven.
But whoever does and teaches what theMATTHEW 5
19
commands say will be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.
20 I can guarantee that unless you
live a life that has God’s approval and
do it more faithfully than the scribes
and Pharisees, you will never enter the
kingdom of heaven.
21 "You have heard that it was said to
your ancestors, ‘Never murder. Whoever
murders will answer for it in court.’
22 But I can guarantee that whoever is
angry with another believer will answer
for it in court. Whoever calls another
believer an insul ng name will answer
for it in the highest court. Whoever calls
another believer a fool will answer for it
in hellﬁre.
23 "So if you are oﬀering your gi at the
altar and remember there that another
believer has something against you,MATTHEW 5
24 leave your gi
20
at the altar. First go
away and make peace with that person.
Then come back and oﬀer your gi .
25 "Make peace quickly with your
opponent while you are on the way to
court with him. Otherwise, he will hand
you over to the judge. Then the judge
will hand you over to an oﬃcer, who will
throw you into prison.
26 I can guarantee this truth: You will
never get out un l you pay every penny
of your ﬁne.
27 "You have heard that it was said,
‘Never commit adultery.’
28 But I can guarantee that whoever
looks with lust at a woman has already
commi ed adultery in his heart.
29 "So if your right eye causes you to
sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is
be er for you to lose a part of your body
than to have all of it thrown into hell.MATTHEW 5
21
30 And if your right hand leads you to
sin, cut it oﬀ and throw it away. It is
be er for you to lose a part of your body
than to have all of it go into hell.
31 "It has also been said, ‘Whoever
divorces his wife must give her a wri en
no ce.’
32 But I can guarantee that any man
who divorces his wife for any reason
other than unfaithfulness makes her
look as though she has commi ed
adultery. Whoever marries a woman
divorced in this way makes himself look
as though he has commi ed adultery.
33 "You have heard that it was said to
your ancestors, ‘Never break your oath,
but give to the Lord what you swore in
an oath to give him.’
34 But I tell you don’t swear an oath
at all. Don’t swear an oath by heaven,
which is God’s throne,MATTHEW 5
22
35 or by the earth, which is his footstool,
or by Jerusalem, which is the city of the
great King.
36 And don’t swear an oath by your
head. A er all, you cannot make one
hair black or white.
37 Simply say yes or no. Anything more
than that comes from the evil one.
38 "You have heard that it was said, ‘An
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
39 But I tell you not to oppose an evil
person. If someone slaps you on your
right cheek, turn your other cheek to
him as well.
40 If someone wants to sue you in order
to take your shirt, let him have your coat
too.
41 If someone forces you to go one mile,
go two miles with him.
42 Give to everyone who asks you for
something. Don’t turn anyone away who
wants to borrow something from you.MATTHEW 5 – 6
23
43 "You have heard that it was said,
‘Love your neighbor, and hate your
enemy.’
44 But I tell you this: Love your enemies,
and pray for those who persecute you.
45 In this way you show that you are
children of your Father in heaven. He
makes his sun rise on people whether
they are good or evil. He lets rain fall on
them whether they are just or unjust.
46 If you love those who love you, do
you deserve a reward? Even the tax
collectors do that!
47 Are you doing anything remarkable
if you welcome only your friends?
Everyone does that!
48 That is why you must be perfect as
your Father in heaven is perfect.
1 "Be careful not to do your good
works in public in order to a ract
a en on. If you do, your Father in
heaven will not reward you.
6MATTHEW 6
24
2 So when you give to the poor, don’t
announce it with trumpet fanfare. This
is what hypocrites do in the synagogues
and on the streets in order to be praised
by people. I can guarantee this truth:
That will be their only reward.
3 When you give to the poor, don’t let
your le hand know what your right
hand is doing.
4 Give your contribu ons privately. Your
Father sees what you do in private. He
will reward you.
5 "When you pray, don’t be like
hypocrites. They like to stand in
synagogues and on street corners to
pray so that everyone can see them. I
can guarantee this truth: That will be
their only reward.
6 When you pray, go to your room and
close the door. Pray privately to your
Father who is with you. Your Father seesMATTHEW 6
25
what you do in private. He will reward
you.
7 "When you pray, don’t ramble like
heathens who think they’ll be heard if
they talk a lot.
8 Don’t be like them. Your Father knows
what you need before you ask him.
9 "This is how you should pray: Our
Father in heaven, let your name be kept
holy.
10 Let your kingdom come. Let your will
be done on earth as it is done in heaven.
11 Give us our daily bread today.
12 Forgive us as we forgive others.
13 Don’t allow us to be tempted.
Instead, rescue us from the evil one.
14 "If you forgive the failures of others,
your heavenly Father will also forgive
you.
15 But if you don’t forgive others, your
Father will not forgive your failures.MATTHEW 6
26
16 "When you fast, stop looking sad
like hypocrites. They put on sad faces
to make it obvious that they’re fas ng.
I can guarantee this truth: That will be
their only reward.
17 When you fast, wash your face and
comb your hair.
18 Then your fas ng won’t be obvious.
Instead, it will be obvious to your Father
who is with you in private. Your Father
sees what you do in private. He will
reward you.
19 "Stop storing up treasures for
yourselves on earth, where moths and
rust destroy and thieves break in and
steal.
20 Instead, store up treasures for
yourselves in heaven, where moths and
rust don’t destroy and thieves don’t
break in and steal.
21 Your heart will be where your
treasure is.MATTHEW 6
27
22 "The eye is the lamp of the body. So if
your eye is unclouded, your whole body
will be full of light.
23 But if your eye is evil, your whole
body will be full of darkness. If the light
in you is darkness, how dark it will be!
24 "No one can serve two masters. He
will hate the ﬁrst master and love the
second, or he will be devoted to the
ﬁrst and despise the second. You cannot
serve God and wealth.
25 "So I tell you to stop worrying about
what you will eat, drink, or wear. Isn’t
life more than food and the body more
than clothes?
26 "Look at the birds. They don’t plant,
harvest, or gather the harvest into barns.
Yet, your heavenly Father feeds them.
Aren’t you worth more than they?
27 "Can any of you add a single hour to
your life by worrying?MATTHEW 6
28
28 "And why worry about clothes?
No ce how the ﬂowers grow in the ﬁeld.
They never work or spin yarn for clothes.
29 But I say that not even Solomon in
all his majesty was dressed like one of
these ﬂowers.
30 That’s the way God clothes the
grass in the ﬁeld. Today it’s alive, and
tomorrow it’s thrown into an incinerator.
So how much more will he clothe you
people who have so li le faith?
31 "Don’t ever worry and say, ‘What
are we going to eat?’ or ‘What are we
going to drink?’ or ‘What are we going
to wear?’
32 Everyone is concerned about these
things, and your heavenly Father
certainly knows you need all of them.
33 But ﬁrst, be concerned about his
kingdom and what has his approval.
Then all these things will be provided for
you.MATTHEW 6 – 7
29
34 "So don’t ever worry about
tomorrow. A er all, tomorrow will worry
about itself. Each day has enough trouble
of its own.
1 "Stop judging so that you will not
be judged.
2 Otherwise, you will be judged by the
same standard you use to judge others.
The standards you use for others will be
applied to you.
3 So why do you see the piece of
sawdust in another believer’s eye and
not no ce the wooden beam in your
own eye?
4 How can you say to another believer,
‘Let me take the piece of sawdust out of
your eye,’ when you have a beam in your
own eye?
5 You hypocrite! First remove the beam
from your own eye. Then you will see
clearly to remove the piece of sawdust
from another believer’s eye.
7MATTHEW 7
30
6 "Don’t give what is holy to dogs or
throw your pearls to pigs. Otherwise,
they will trample them and then tear
you to pieces.
7 "Ask, and you will receive. Search, and
you will ﬁnd. Knock, and the door will be
opened for you.
8 Everyone who asks will receive. The
one who searches will ﬁnd, and for
the one who knocks, the door will be
opened.
9 "If your child asks you for bread,
would any of you give him a stone?
10 Or if your child asks for a ﬁsh, would
you give him a snake?
11 Even though you’re evil, you know
how to give good gi s to your children.
So how much more will your Father in
heaven give good things to those who
ask him?
12 "Always do for other people
everything you want them to do for you.MATTHEW 7
31
That is the meaning of Moses’ Teachings
and the Prophets.
13 "Enter through the narrow gate
because the gate and road that lead
to destruc on are wide. Many enter
through the wide gate.
14 But the narrow gate and the road
that lead to life are full of trouble. Only a
few people ﬁnd the narrow gate.
15 "Beware of false prophets. They
come to you disguised as sheep, but in
their hearts they are vicious wolves.
16 You will know them by what they
produce. "People don’t pick grapes from
thornbushes or ﬁgs from thistles, do
they?
17 In the same way every good tree
produces good fruit, but a ro en tree
produces bad fruit.
18 A good tree cannot produce bad
fruit, and a ro en tree cannot produce
good fruit.MATTHEW 7
32
19 Any tree that fails to produce good
fruit is cut down and thrown into a ﬁre.
20 So you will know them by what they
produce.
21 "Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord,
Lord!’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
but only the person who does what my
Father in heaven wants.
22 Many will say to me on that day,
‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your
name? Didn’t we force out demons and
do many miracles by the power and
authority of your name?’
23 Then I will tell them publicly, ‘I’ve
never known you. Get away from me,
you evil people.’
24 "Therefore, everyone who hears
what I say and obeys it will be like a wise
person who built a house on rock.
25 Rain poured, and ﬂoods came. Winds
blew and beat against that house. But itMATTHEW 7 – 8
33
did not collapse, because its founda on
was on rock.
26 "Everyone who hears what I say but
doesn’t obey it will be like a foolish
person who built a house on sand.
27 Rain poured, and ﬂoods came. Winds
blew and struck that house. It collapsed,
and the result was a total disaster."
28 When Jesus ﬁnished this speech, the
crowds were amazed at his teachings.
29 Unlike their scribes, he taught them
with authority.
1 When Jesus came down from the
mountain, large crowds followed
him.
2 A man with a serious skin disease
came and bowed down in front of him.
The man said to Jesus, "Sir, if you’re
willing, you can make me clean."
3 Jesus reached out, touched him,
and said, "I’m willing. So be clean!"
8MATTHEW 8
34
Immediately, his skin disease went away,
and he was clean.
4 Jesus said to him, "Don’t tell anyone
about this! Instead, show yourself to the
priest. Then oﬀer the sacriﬁce Moses
commanded as proof to people that you
are clean."
5 When Jesus went to Capernaum, a
Roman army oﬃcer came to beg him for
help.
6 The oﬃcer said, "Sir, my servant is
lying at home paralyzed and in terrible
pain."
7 Jesus said to him, "I’ll come to heal
him."
8 The oﬃcer responded, "Sir, I don’t
deserve to have you come into my
house. But just give a command, and my
servant will be healed.
9 As you know, I’m in a chain of
command and have soldiers at my
command. I tell one of them, ‘Go!’ andMATTHEW 8
35
he goes, and another, ‘Come!’ and he
comes. I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and
he does it."
10 Jesus was amazed when he heard
this. He said to those who were following
him, "I can guarantee this truth: I haven’t
found faith as great as this in anyone in
Israel.
11 I can guarantee that many will come
from all over the world. They will eat
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
kingdom of heaven.
12 The ci zens of that kingdom will
be thrown outside into the darkness.
People will cry and be in extreme pain
there.
13 Jesus told the oﬃcer, "Go! What you
believed will be done for you." And at
that moment the servant was healed.
14 When Jesus went to Peter’s house,
he saw Peter’s mother–in–law in bed
with a fever.MATTHEW 8
36
15 Jesus touched her hand, and the
fever went away. So she got up and
prepared a meal for him.
16 In the evening the people brought
him many who were possessed by
demons. He forced the evil spirits out
of people with a command and cured
everyone who was sick.
17 So what the prophet Isaiah had
said came true: "He took away our
weaknesses and removed our diseases."
18 Now, when Jesus saw a crowd around
him, he ordered his disciples to cross to
the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
19 A scribe came to him and said,
"Teacher, I’ll follow you wherever you
go."
20 Jesus told him, "Foxes have holes,
and birds have nests, but the Son of Man
has nowhere to sleep."
21 Another disciple said to him, "Sir, ﬁrst
let me go to bury my father."MATTHEW 8
37
22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and
let the dead bury their own dead."
23 Jesus’ disciples went with him as he
le in a boat.
24 Suddenly, a severe storm came
across the sea. The waves were covering
the boat. Yet, Jesus was sleeping.
25 So they woke him up, saying, "Lord!
Save us! We’re going to die!"
26 Jesus said to them, "Why do you
cowards have so li le faith?" Then he
got up, gave an order to the wind and
the sea, and the sea became very calm.
27 The men were amazed and asked,
"What kind of man is this? Even the wind
and the sea obey him!"
28 When he arrived in the territory of
the Gadarenes on the other side of the
Sea of Galilee, two men met him. They
were possessed by demons and had
come out of the tombs. No one couldMATTHEW 8
38
travel along that road because the men
were so dangerous.
29 They shouted, "Why are you
bothering us now, Son of God? Did you
come here to torture us before it is
me?"
30 A large herd of pigs was feeding in
the distance.
31 The demons begged Jesus, "If you’re
going to force us out, send us into that
herd of pigs."
32 Jesus said to them, "Go!" The
demons came out and went into the
pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed
down the cliﬀ into the sea and died in
the water.
33 Those who took care of the pigs
ran into the city. There they reported
everything, especially about the men
possessed by demons.MATTHEW 8 – 9
39
34 Everyone from the city went to meet
Jesus. When they saw him, they begged
him to leave their territory.
1 Jesus got into a boat, crossed the
sea, and came to his own city.
2 Some people brought him a paralyzed
man on a stretcher. When Jesus saw
their faith, he said to the man, "Cheer
up, friend! Your sins are forgiven."
3 Then some of the scribes thought,
"He’s dishonoring God."
4 Jesus knew what they were thinking.
He asked them, "Why are you thinking
evil things?
5 Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are
forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
6 I want you to know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
"Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go
home."
7 So the man got up and went home.
9MATTHEW 9
40
8 When the crowd saw this, they were
ﬁlled with awe and praised God for
giving such authority to humans.
9 When Jesus was leaving that place,
he saw a man si ng in a tax oﬃce. The
man’s name was Ma hew. Jesus said to
him, "Follow me!" So Ma hew got up
and followed him.
10 Later Jesus was having dinner at
Ma hew’s house. Many tax collectors
and sinners came to eat with Jesus and
his disciples.
11 The Pharisees saw this and asked his
disciples, "Why does your teacher eat
with tax collectors and sinners?"
12 When Jesus heard that, he said,
"Healthy people don’t need a doctor;
those who are sick do.
13 Learn what this means: ‘I want mercy,
not sacriﬁces.’ I’ve come to call sinners,
not people who think they have God’s
approval."MATTHEW 9
41
14 Then John’s disciples came to Jesus.
They said, "Why do we and the Pharisees
fast o en but your disciples never do?"
15 Jesus replied, "Can wedding guests
be sad while the groom is s ll with
them? The me will come when the
groom will be taken away from them.
Then they will fast.
16 "No one patches an old coat with
a new piece of cloth that will shrink.
When the patch shrinks, it will rip away
from the coat, and the tear will become
worse.
17 Nor do people pour new wine into
old wineskins. If they do, the skins burst,
the wine runs out, and the skins are
ruined. Rather, people pour new wine
into fresh skins, and both are saved."
18 A synagogue leader came to Jesus
while he was talking to John’s disciples.
He bowed down in front of Jesus andMATTHEW 9
42
said, "My daughter just died. Come, lay
your hand on her, and she will live."
19 Jesus and his disciples got up and
followed the man.
20 Then a woman came up behind Jesus
and touched the edge of his clothes.
She had been suﬀering from chronic
bleeding for twelve years.
21 She thought, "If I only touch his
clothes, I’ll get well."
22 When Jesus turned and saw her he
said, "Cheer up, daughter! Your faith has
made you well." At that very moment
the woman became well.
23 Jesus came to the synagogue leader’s
house. He saw ﬂute players and a noisy
crowd.
24 He said to them, "Leave! The girl
is not dead. She’s sleeping." But they
laughed at him.MATTHEW 9
43
25 When the crowd had been put
outside, Jesus went in, took her hand,
and the girl came back to life.
26 The news about this spread
throughout that region.
27 When Jesus le that place, two blind
men followed him. They shouted, "Have
mercy on us, Son of David."
28 Jesus went into a house, and the
blind men followed him. He said to
them, "Do you believe that I can do
this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
29 He touched their eyes and said,
"What you have believed will be done
for you!"
30 Then they could see. He warned
them, "Don’t let anyone know about
this!"
31 But they went out and spread the
news about him throughout that region.
32 As they were leaving, some people
brought a man to Jesus. The man wasMATTHEW 9
44
unable to talk because he was possessed
by a demon.
33 But as soon as the demon was forced
out, the man began to speak. The crowds
were amazed and said, "We have never
seen anything like this in Israel!"
34 But the Pharisees said, "He forces
demons out of people with the help of
the ruler of demons."
35 Jesus went to all the towns and
villages. He taught in the synagogues
and spread the Good News of the
kingdom. He also cured every disease
and sickness.
36 When he saw the crowds, he felt
sorry for them. They were troubled and
helpless like sheep without a shepherd.
37 Then he said to his disciples, "The
harvest is large, but the workers are few.
38 So ask the Lord who gives this harvest
to send workers to harvest his crops."MATTHEW 10
10
45
1 Jesus called his twelve disciples
and gave them authority to force
evil spirits out of people and to cure
every disease and sickness.
2 These are the names of the twelve
apostles: ﬁrst and foremost, Simon (who
is called Peter) and his brother Andrew;
James and his brother John, the sons of
Zebedee;
3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and
Ma hew the tax collector; James (son of
Alphaeus), and Thaddaeus;
4 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot,
who later betrayed Jesus.
5 Jesus sent these twelve out with the
following instruc ons: "Don’t go among
people who are not Jewish or into any
Samaritan city.
6 Instead, go to the lost sheep of the
na on of Israel.
7 As you go, spread this message: ‘The
kingdom of heaven is near.’MATTHEW 10
46
8 Cure the sick, bring the dead back to
life, cleanse those with skin diseases,
and force demons out of people. Give
these things without charging, since you
received them without paying.
9 "Don’t take any gold, silver, or even
copper coins in your pockets.
10 Don’t take a traveling bag for the trip,
a change of clothes, sandals, or a walking
s ck. A er all, the worker deserves to
have his needs met.
11 "When you go into a city or village,
look for people who will listen to you
there. Stay with them un l you leave
that place.
12 When you go into a house, greet the
family.
13 If it is a family that listens to you,
allow your gree ng to stand. But if it is
not recep ve, take back your gree ng.MATTHEW 10
47
14 If anyone doesn’t welcome you or
listen to what you say, leave that house
or city, and shake its dust oﬀ your feet.
15 I can guarantee this truth: Judgment
day will be be er for Sodom and
Gomorrah than for that city.
16 "I’m sending you out like sheep
among wolves. So be as cunning as
snakes but as innocent as doves.
17 Watch out for people who will hand
you over to the Jewish courts and whip
you in their synagogues.
18 Because of me you will even be
brought in front of governors and kings
to tes fy to them and to everyone in the
world.
19 When they hand you over to the
authori es, don’t worry about what to
say or how to say it. When the me
comes, you will be given what to say.MATTHEW 10
48
20 Indeed, you’re not the ones who will
be speaking. The Spirit of your Father
will be speaking through you.
21 "Brother will hand over brother to
death; a father will hand over his child.
Children will rebel against their parents
and kill them.
22 Everyone will hate you because you
are commi ed to me. But the person
who pa ently endures to the end will be
saved.
23 So when they persecute you in one
city, ﬂee to another. I can guarantee this
truth: Before you have gone through
every city in Israel, the Son of Man will
come.
24 "A student is not be er than his
teacher. Nor is a slave be er than his
owner.
25 It is enough for a student to become
like his teacher and a slave like his owner.
If they have called the owner of theMATTHEW 10
49
house Beelzebul, they will certainly call
the family members the same name.
26 So don’t be afraid of them. Nothing
has been covered that will not be
exposed. Whatever is secret will be
made known.
27 Tell in the daylight what I say to you
in the dark. Shout from the housetops
what you hear whispered.
28 Don’t be afraid of those who kill the
body but cannot kill the soul. Instead,
fear the one who can destroy both body
and soul in hell.
29 "Aren’t two sparrows sold for a
penny? Not one of them will fall to
the ground without your Father’s
permission.
30 Every hair on your head has been
counted.
31 Don’t be afraid! You are worth more
than many sparrows.MATTHEW 10
50
32 "So I will acknowledge in front of
my Father in heaven that person who
acknowledges me in front of others.
33 But I will tell my Father in heaven
that I don’t know the person who tells
others that he doesn’t know me.
34 "Don’t think that I came to bring
peace to earth. I didn’t come to bring
peace but conﬂict.
35 I came to turn a man against
his father, a daughter against her
mother, a daughter–in–law against her
mother–in–law.
36 A person’s enemies will be the
members of his own family.
37 "The person who loves his father or
mother more than me does not deserve
to be my disciple. The person who loves
a son or daughter more than me does
not deserve to be my disciple.MATTHEW 10 – 11
51
38 Whoever doesn’t take up his cross
and follow me doesn’t deserve to be my
disciple.
39 The person who tries to preserve his
life will lose it, but the person who loses
his life for me will preserve it.
40 "The person who welcomes you
welcomes me, and the person who
welcomes me welcomes the one who
sent me.
41 The person who welcomes a prophet
as a prophet will receive a prophet’s
reward. The person who welcomes a
righteous person as a righteous person
will receive a righteous person’s reward.
42 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever
gives any of my humble followers a cup
of cold water because that person is
my disciple will certainly never lose his
reward."
1 A er Jesus ﬁnished giving
his twelve disciples these
11MATTHEW 11
52
instruc ons, he moved on from there to
teach his message in their ci es.
2 When John was in prison, he heard
about the things Christ had done. So he
sent his disciples
3 to ask Jesus, "Are you the one who is
coming, or should we look for someone
else?"
4 Jesus answered John’s disciples, "Go
back, and tell John what you hear and
see:
5 Blind people see again, lame people
are walking, those with skin diseases
are made clean, deaf people hear again,
dead people are brought back to life,
and poor people hear the Good News.
6 Whoever doesn’t lose his faith in me
is indeed blessed."
7 As they were leaving, Jesus spoke
to the crowds about John. "What did
you go into the desert to see? Tall grass
swaying in the wind?MATTHEW 11
53
8 Really, what did you go to see? A man
dressed in ﬁne clothes? Those who wear
ﬁne clothes are in royal palaces.
9 "Really, what did you go to see? A
prophet? Let me tell you that he is far
more than a prophet.
10 John is the one about whom Scripture
says, ‘I’m sending my messenger ahead
of you to prepare the way in front of
you.’
11 "I can guarantee this truth: Of all
the people ever born, no one is greater
than John the Bap zer. Yet, the least
important person in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than John.
12 From the me of John the Bap zer
un l now, the kingdom of heaven has
been forcefully advancing, and forceful
people have been seizing it.
13 All the Prophets and Moses’
Teachings prophesied up to the me of
John.MATTHEW 11
54
14 If you are willing to accept their
message, John is the Elijah who was to
come.
15 Let the person who has ears listen!
16 "How can I describe the people who
are living now? They are like children
who sit in the marketplaces and shout to
other children,
17 ’We played music for you, but you
didn’t dance. We sang a funeral song,
but you didn’t show any sadness.’
18 "John came neither ea ng nor
drinking, and people say, ‘There’s a
demon in him!’
19 The Son of Man came ea ng and
drinking, and people say, ‘Look at him!
He’s a glu on and a drunk, a friend of
tax collectors and sinners!’ "Yet, wisdom
is proved right by its ac ons."
20 Then Jesus denounced the ci es
where he had worked most of hisMATTHEW 11
55
miracles because they had not changed
the way they thought and acted.
21 "How horrible it will be for you,
Chorazin! How horrible it will be for you,
Bethsaida! If the miracles worked in you
had been worked in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have changed the way they
thought and acted long ago in sackcloth
and ashes.
22 I can guarantee that judgment day
will be be er for Tyre and Sidon than for
you.
23 And you, Capernaum, will you be
li ed to heaven? No, you will go down
to hell! If the miracles that had been
worked in you had been worked in
Sodom, it would s ll be there today.
24 I can guarantee that judgment day
will be be er for Sodom than for you."
25 At that me Jesus said, "I praise
you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for hiding these things from wise andMATTHEW 11 – 12
56
intelligent people and revealing them to
li le children.
26 Yes, Father, this is what pleased you.
27 "My Father has turned everything
over to me. Only the Father knows
the Son. And no one knows the Father
except the Son and those to whom the
Son is willing to reveal him.
28 "Come to me, all who are red from
carrying heavy loads, and I will give you
rest.
29 Place my yoke over your shoulders,
and learn from me, because I am gentle
and humble. Then you will ﬁnd rest for
yourselves
30 because my yoke is easy and my
burden is light."
1 Then on a day of worship Jesus
walked through the grainﬁelds.
His disciples were hungry and began to
pick the heads of grain to eat.
12MATTHEW 12
57
2 When the Pharisees saw this, they
said to him, "Look! Your disciples are
doing something that is not right to do
on the day of worship."
3 Jesus asked them, "Haven’t you read
what David did when he and his men
were hungry?
4 Haven’t you read how he went into
the house of God and ate the bread of
the presence? He and his men had no
right to eat those loaves. Only the priests
have that right.
5 Or haven’t you read in Moses’
Teachings that on the day of worship
the priests in the temple do things they
shouldn’t on the day of worship yet
remain innocent?
6 I can guarantee that something
greater than the temple is here.
7 If you had known what ‘I want mercy,
not sacriﬁces’ means, you would not
have condemned innocent people.MATTHEW 12
58
8 "The Son of Man has authority over
the day of worship."
9 Jesus moved on from there and went
into a synagogue.
10 A man with a paralyzed hand was
there. The people asked Jesus whether
it was right to heal on a day of worship
so that they could accuse him of doing
something wrong.
11 Jesus said to them, "Suppose one of
you has a sheep. If it falls into a pit on a
day of worship, wouldn’t you take hold
of it and li it out?
12 Certainly, a human is more valuable
than a sheep! So it is right to do good on
the day of worship."
13 Then he said to the man, "Hold out
your hand." The man held it out, and it
became normal again, as healthy as the
other.
14 The Pharisees le and plo ed to kill
Jesus.MATTHEW 12
15 He knew about this, so he le
59
that
place. Many people followed him, and
he cured all of them.
16 He also ordered them not to tell
people who he was.
17 So what the prophet Isaiah had said
came true:
18 "Here is my servant whom I have
chosen, whom I love, and in whom I
delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and
he will announce jus ce to the na ons.
19 He will not quarrel or shout, and no
one will hear his voice in the streets.
20 He will not break oﬀ a damaged
ca ail. He will not even put out a
smoking wick un l he has made jus ce
victorious.
21 The na ons will have hope because
of him."
22 Then some people brought Jesus a
man possessed by a demon. The demon
made the man blind and unable to talk.MATTHEW 12
60
Jesus cured him so that he could talk and
see.
23 The crowds were all amazed and said,
"Can this man be the Son of David?"
24 When the Pharisees heard this, they
said, "This man can force demons out of
people only with the help of Beelzebul,
the ruler of demons."
25 Since Jesus knew what they were
thinking, he said to them, "Every
kingdom divided against itself is ruined.
And every city or household divided
against itself will not last.
26 If Satan forces Satan out, he is
divided against himself. How, then, can
his kingdom last?
27 If I force demons out of people with
the help of Beelzebul, who helps your
followers force them out? That’s why
they will be your judges.MATTHEW 12
61
28 But if I force demons out with the
help of God’s Spirit, then the kingdom of
God has come to you.
29 How can anyone go into a strong
man’s house and steal his property? First
he must e up the strong man. Then he
can go through his house and steal his
property.
30 "Whoever isn’t with me is against
me. Whoever doesn’t gather with me
sca ers.
31 So I can guarantee that people will be
forgiven for any sin or cursing. However,
cursing the Spirit will not be forgiven.
32 Whoever speaks a word against the
Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever
speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be
forgiven in this world or the next.
33 "Make a tree good, and then its fruit
will be good. Or make a tree ro en, and
then its fruit will be ro en. A person can
recognize a tree by its fruit.MATTHEW 12
62
34 You poisonous snakes! How can you
evil people say anything good? Your
mouth says what comes from inside you.
35 Good people do the good things that
are in them. But evil people do the evil
things that are in them.
36 "I can guarantee that on judgment
day people will have to give an account
of every careless word they say.
37 By your words you will be declared
innocent, or by your words you will be
declared guilty."
38 Then some scribes and Pharisees
said, "Teacher, we want you to show us a
miraculous sign."
39 He responded, "The people of an evil
and unfaithful era look for a miraculous
sign. But the only sign they will get is the
sign of the prophet Jonah.
40 Just as Jonah was in the belly of a
huge ﬁsh for three days and three nights,
so the Son of Man will be in the heartMATTHEW 12
63
of the earth for three days and three
nights.
41 The men of Nineveh will stand up
with you at the me of judgment and
will condemn you, because they turned
to God and changed the way they
thought and acted when Jonah spoke
his message. But look, someone greater
than Jonah is here!
42 The queen from the south will stand
up at the me of judgment with you.
She will condemn you, because she
came from the ends of the earth to hear
Solomon’s wisdom. But look, someone
greater than Solomon is here!
43 "When an evil spirit comes out of
a person, it goes through dry places
looking for a place to rest. But it doesn’t
ﬁnd any.
44 Then it says, ‘I’ll go back to the home
I le .’ When it arrives, it ﬁnds the house
unoccupied, swept clean, and in order.MATTHEW 12
64
45 Then it goes and brings along seven
other spirits more evil than itself. They
enter and take up permanent residence
there. In the end the condi on of that
person is worse than it was before. That
is what will happen to the evil people of
this day."
46 While Jesus was s ll talking to the
crowds, his mother and brothers were
standing outside. They wanted to talk to
him.
47 Someone told him, "Your mother and
your brothers are standing outside. They
want to talk to you."
48 He replied to the man speaking to
him, "Who is my mother, and who are
my brothers?"
49 Poin ng with his hand at his disciples,
he said, "Look, here are my mother and
my brothers.MATTHEW 12 – 13
65
50 Whoever does what my Father in
heaven wants is my brother and sister
and mother."
1 That same day Jesus le the
house and sat down by the Sea of
Galilee.
2 The crowd that gathered around him
was so large that he got into a boat. He
sat in the boat while the en re crowd
stood on the shore.
3 Then he used stories as illustra ons to
tell them many things. He said, "Listen!
A farmer went to plant seed.
4 Some seeds were planted along the
road, and birds came and devoured
them.
5 Other seeds were planted on rocky
ground, where there was li le soil. The
plants sprouted quickly because the soil
wasn’t deep.
13MATTHEW 13
66
6 But when the sun came up, they were
scorched. They withered because their
roots weren’t deep enough.
7 Other seeds were planted among
thornbushes, and the thornbushes grew
up and choked them.
8 But other seeds were planted on
good ground and produced grain. They
produced one hundred, sixty, or thirty
mes as much as was planted.
9 Let the person who has ears listen!"
10 The disciples asked him, "Why do
you use stories as illustra ons when you
speak to people?"
11 Jesus answered, "Knowledge about
the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
has been given to you. But it has not
been given to the crowd.
12 Those who understand these
mysteries will be given more knowledge,
and they will excel in understanding
them. However, some people don’tMATTHEW 13
67
understand these mysteries. Even what
they understand will be taken away from
them.
13 This is why I speak to them this way.
They see, but they’re blind. They hear,
but they don’t listen. They don’t even try
to understand.
14 So they make Isaiah’s prophecy come
true: ‘You will hear clearly but never
understand. You will see clearly but
never comprehend.
15 These people have become close–
minded and hard of hearing. They have
shut their eyes so that their eyes never
see. Their ears never hear. Their minds
never understand. And they never return
to me for healing!’
16 "Blessed are your eyes because they
see and your ears because they hear.
17 I can guarantee this truth: Many
prophets and many of God’s people
longed to see what you see but didn’tMATTHEW 13
68
see it, to hear what you hear but didn’t
hear it.
18 "Listen to what the story about the
farmer means.
19 Someone hears the word about the
kingdom but doesn’t understand it. The
evil one comes at once and snatches
away what was planted in him. This is
what the seed planted along the road
illustrates.
20 The seed planted on rocky ground
is the person who hears the word and
accepts it at once with joy.
21 Since he doesn’t have any root, he
lasts only a li le while. When suﬀering
or persecu on comes along because
of the word, he immediately falls from
faith.
22 The seed planted among thornbushes
is another person who hears the word.
But the worries of life and the decei ulMATTHEW 13
69
pleasures of riches choke the word so
that it can’t produce anything.
23 But the seed planted on good ground
is the person who hears and understands
the word. This type produces crops. They
produce one hundred, sixty, or thirty
mes as much as was planted."
24 Jesus used another illustra on. He
said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a
man who planted good seed in his ﬁeld.
25 But while people were asleep, his
enemy planted weeds in the wheat ﬁeld
and went away.
26 When the wheat came up and
formed kernels, weeds appeared.
27 "The owner’s workers came to him
and asked, ‘Sir, didn’t you plant good
seed in your ﬁeld? Where did the weeds
come from?’
28 "He told them, ‘An enemy did this.’
"His workers asked him, ‘Do you want us
to pull out the weeds?’MATTHEW 13
70
29 "He replied, ‘No. If you pull out the
weeds, you may pull out the wheat with
them.
30 Let both grow together un l the
harvest. When the grain is cut, I will tell
the workers to gather the weeds ﬁrst
and e them in bundles to be burned.
But I’ll have them bring the wheat into
my barn.’"
31 Jesus used another illustra on. He
said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a
mustard seed that someone planted in a
ﬁeld.
32 It’s one of the smallest seeds.
However, when it has grown, it is taller
than the garden plants. It becomes a
tree that is large enough for birds to nest
in its branches."
33 He used another illustra on. "The
kingdom of heaven is like yeast that
a woman mixed into a large amountMATTHEW 13

of ﬂour un l the yeast worked its way
through all the dough."
34 Jesus used illustra ons to tell the
crowds all these things. He did not tell
them anything without illustra ng it
with a story.
35 So what the prophet had said came
true: "I will open my mouth to illustrate
points. I will tell what has been hidden
since the world was made."
36 When Jesus had sent the people
away, he went into the house. His
disciples came to him and said, "Explain
what the illustra on of the weeds in the
ﬁeld means."
37 He answered, "The one who plants
the good seeds is the Son of Man.
38 The ﬁeld is the world. The good seeds
are those who belong to the kingdom.
The weeds are those who belong to the
evil one.MATTHEW 13
72
39 The enemy who planted them is
the devil. The harvest is the end of the
world. The workers are angels.
40 Just as weeds are gathered and
burned, so it will be at the end of me.
41 The Son of Man will send his angels.
They will gather everything in his
kingdom that causes people to sin and
everyone who does evil.
42 The angels will throw them into a
blazing furnace. People will cry and be in
extreme pain there.
43 Then the people who have God’s
approval will shine like the sun in their
Father’s kingdom. Let the person who
has ears listen!
44 "The kingdom of heaven is like a
treasure buried in a ﬁeld. When a man
discovered it, he buried it again. He was
so delighted with it that he went away,
sold everything he had, and bought that
ﬁeld.MATTHEW 13
73
45 "Also, the kingdom of heaven is like
a merchant who was searching for ﬁne
pearls.
46 When he found a valuable pearl, he
went away, sold everything he had, and
bought it.
47 "Also, the kingdom of heaven is like
a net that was thrown into the sea. It
gathered all kinds of ﬁsh.
48 When it was full, they pulled it to the
shore. Then they sat down, gathered the
good ﬁsh into containers, and threw the
bad ones away.
49 The same thing will happen at the
end of me. The angels will go out and
separate the evil people from people
who have God’s approval.
50 Then the angels will throw the evil
people into a blazing furnace. They will
cry and be in extreme pain there.
51 "Have you understood all of this?"
"Yes," they answered.MATTHEW 13
74
52 So Jesus said to them, "That is why
every scribe who has become a disciple
of the kingdom of heaven is like a home
owner. He brings new and old things out
of his treasure chest."
53 When Jesus had ﬁnished these
illustra ons, he le that place.
54 Jesus went to his hometown and
taught the people in the synagogue in
a way that amazed them. People were
asking, "Where did this man get this
wisdom and the power to do these
miracles?
55 Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t
his mother’s name Mary? Aren’t his
brothers’ names James, Joseph, Simon,
and Judas?
56 And aren’t all his sisters here with us?
Where, then, did this man get all this?"
57 So they took oﬀense at him. But Jesus
said to them, "The only place a prophetMATTHEW 13 – 14
75
isn’t honored is in his hometown and in
his own house."
58 He didn’t work many miracles there
because of their lack of faith.
1 At that me Herod, ruler of
Galilee, heard the news about
Jesus.
2 He said to his oﬃcials, "This is John
the Bap zer! He has come back to life.
That’s why he has the power to perform
these miracles."
3 Herod had arrested John, ed him up,
and put him in prison. Herod did this for
Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
4 John had been telling Herod, "It’s not
right for you to be married to her."
5 So Herod wanted to kill John. However,
he was afraid of the people because they
thought John was a prophet.
6 When Herod celebrated his birthday,
Herodias’ daughter danced for his
14MATTHEW 14
76
guests. Herod was so delighted with her
that
7 he swore he would give her anything
she wanted.
8 Urged by her mother, she said, "Give
me the head of John the Bap zer on a
pla er."
9 The king regre ed his promise. But
because of his oath and his guests, he
ordered that her wish be granted.
10 He had John’s head cut oﬀ in prison.
11 So the head was brought on a pla er
and given to the girl, who took it to her
mother.
12 John’s disciples came for the body
and buried it. Then they went to tell
Jesus.
13 When Jesus heard about John, he le
in a boat and went to a place where he
could be alone. The crowds heard about
this and followed him on foot from the
ci es.MATTHEW 14
77
14 When Jesus got out of the boat, he
saw a large crowd. He felt sorry for them
and cured their sick people.
15 In the evening the disciples came to
him. They said, "No one lives around
here, and it’s already late. Send the
crowds to the villages to buy food for
themselves."
16 Jesus said to them, "They don’t need
to go away. You give them something to
eat."
17 They told him, "All we have here are
ﬁve loaves of bread and two ﬁsh."
18 Jesus said, "Bring them to me."
19 Then he ordered the people to sit
down on the grass. A er he took the
ﬁve loaves and the two ﬁsh, he looked
up to heaven and blessed the food. He
broke the loaves apart, gave them to
the disciples, and they gave them to the
people.MATTHEW 14
78
20 All of them ate as much as they
wanted. When they picked up the
le over pieces, they ﬁlled twelve
baskets.
21 About ﬁve thousand men had eaten.
(This number does not include the
women and children who had eaten.)
22 Jesus quickly made his disciples get
into a boat and cross to the other side
ahead of him while he sent the people
away.
23 A er sending the people away, he
went up a mountain to pray by himself.
When evening came, he was there
alone.
24 The boat, now hundreds of yards
from shore, was being thrown around by
the waves because it was going against
the wind.
25 Between three and six o’clock in
the morning, he came to them. He was
walking on the sea.MATTHEW 14
79
26 When the disciples saw him walking
on the sea, they were terriﬁed. They
said, "It’s a ghost!" and began to scream
because they were afraid.
27 Immediately, Jesus said, "Calm down!
It’s me. Don’t be afraid!"
28 Peter answered, "Lord, if it is you,
order me to come to you on the water."
29 Jesus said, "Come!" So Peter got out
of the boat and walked on the water
toward Jesus.
30 But when he no ced how strong the
wind was, he became afraid and started
to sink. He shouted, "Lord, save me!"
31 Immediately, Jesus reached out,
caught hold of him, and said, "You have
so li le faith! Why did you doubt?"
32 When they got into the boat, the
wind stopped blowing.
33 The men in the boat bowed down in
front of Jesus and said, "You are truly the
Son of God."MATTHEW 14 – 15
80
34 They crossed the sea and landed at
Gennesaret.
35 The men there recognized Jesus
and sent messengers all around the
countryside. The people brought him
everyone who was sick.
36 They begged him to let them touch
just the edge of his clothes. Everyone
who touched his clothes was made well.
1 Then some Pharisees and
scribes came from Jerusalem to
Jesus. They asked,
2 "Why do your disciples break the
tradi ons of our ancestors? They do not
wash their hands before they eat."
3 He answered them, "Why do you
break the commandment of God
because of your tradi ons?
4 For example, God said, ‘Honor your
father and your mother’ and ‘Whoever
curses father or mother must be put to
death.’
15MATTHEW 15
81
5 But you say that whoever tells his
father or mother, ‘I have given to God
whatever support you might have
received from me,’
6 does not have to honor his father.
Because of your tradi ons you have
destroyed the authority of God’s word.
7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when
he prophesied about you:
8 ’These people honor me with their
lips, but their hearts are far from me.
9 Their worship of me is pointless,
because their teachings are rules made
by humans.’"
10 Then he called the crowd and said to
them, "Listen and try to understand!
11 What goes into a person’s mouth
doesn’t make him unclean. It’s what
comes out of the mouth that makes a
person unclean."
12 Then the disciples came and said
to him, "Do you realize that when theMATTHEW 15
82
Pharisees heard your statement they
were oﬀended?"
13 He answered, "Any plant that my
heavenly Father did not plant will be
uprooted.
14 Leave them alone! They are blind
leaders. When one blind person leads
another, both will fall into the same pit."
15 Peter said to him, "Explain this
illustra on to us."
16 Jesus said, "Don’t you understand
yet?
17 Don’t you know that whatever goes
into the mouth goes into the stomach
and then into a toilet?
18 But whatever goes out of the mouth
comes from within, and that’s what
makes a person unclean.
19 Evil thoughts, murder, adultery, other
sexual sins, stealing, lying, and cursing
come from within.MATTHEW 15
83
20 These are the things that make a
person unclean. But ea ng without
washing one’s hands doesn’t make a
person unclean."
21 Jesus le that place and went to the
region of Tyre and Sidon.
22 A Canaanite woman from that
territory came to him and began to
shout, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of
David! My daughter is tormented by a
demon."
23 But he did not answer her at all. Then
his disciples came to him and urged him,
"Send her away. She keeps shou ng
behind us."
24 Jesus responded, "I was sent only to
the lost sheep of the na on of Israel."
25 She came to him, bowed down, and
said, "Lord, help me!"
26 Jesus replied, "It’s not right to take
the children’s food and throw it to the
dogs."MATTHEW 15
84
27 She said, "You’re right, Lord. But even
the dogs eat scraps that fall from their
masters’ tables."
28 Then Jesus answered her, "Woman,
you have strong faith! What you wanted
will be done for you." At that moment
her daughter was cured.
29 Jesus moved on from there and went
along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went
up a mountain and sat there.
30 A large crowd came to him, bringing
with them the lame, blind, disabled,
those unable to talk, and many others.
They laid them at his feet, and he cured
them.
31 The crowd was amazed to see mute
people talking, the disabled cured, the
lame walking, and the blind seeing. So
they praised the God of Israel.
32 Jesus called his disciples and said,
"I feel sorry for the people. They have
been with me three days now and haveMATTHEW 15
85
nothing to eat. I don’t want to send
them away hungry, or they may become
exhausted on their way home."
33 His disciples asked him, "Where
could we get enough bread to feed such
a crowd in this place where no one
lives?"
34 Jesus asked them, "How many loaves
of bread do you have?" They answered,
"Seven, and a few small ﬁsh."
35 He ordered the crowd to sit down on
the ground.
36 He took the seven loaves and the ﬁsh
and gave thanks to God. Then he broke
the bread and gave it to the disciples,
and they gave the bread and ﬁsh to the
people.
37 All of them ate as much as they
wanted. The disciples picked up the
le over pieces and ﬁlled seven large
baskets.MATTHEW 15 – 16
86
38 Four thousand men had eaten. (This
number does not include the women
and children who had eaten.)
39 A er he sent the people on their
way, Jesus stepped into the boat and
came to the territory of Magadan.
1 The Pharisees and Sadducees
came to test Jesus. So they asked
him to show them a miraculous sign
from heaven.
2 He responded to them, "In the
evening you say that the weather will be
ﬁne because the sky is red.
3 And in the morning you say that there
will be a storm today because the sky is
red and overcast. You can forecast the
weather by judging the appearance of
the sky, but you cannot interpret the
signs of the mes.
4 "Evil and unfaithful people look for a
miraculous sign. But the only sign they
16MATTHEW 16
87
will be given is that of Jonah." Then he
le them standing there and went away.
5 The disciples had forgo en to take
any bread along when they went to the
other side of the Sea of Galilee.
6 Jesus said to them, "Be careful! Watch
out for the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees!"
7 The disciples had been discussing
among themselves that they had not
taken any bread along.
8 Jesus knew about their conversa on
and asked, "Why are you discussing
among yourselves that you don’t have
any bread? You have so li le faith!
9 Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you
remember the ﬁve loaves for the ﬁve
thousand and how many baskets you
ﬁlled?
10 Don’t you remember the seven
loaves for the four thousand and how
many large baskets you ﬁlled?MATTHEW 16
88
11 Why don’t you understand that I
wasn’t talking to you about bread?
Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees
and Sadducees!"
12 Then they understood that he didn’t
say to watch out for the yeast in bread,
but to watch out for the teachings of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.
13 When Jesus came to the region of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
"Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
14 They answered, "Some say you are
John the Bap zer, others Elijah, s ll
others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
15 He asked them, "But who do you say
I am?"
16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the
Messiah, the Son of the living God!"
17 Jesus replied, "Simon, son of Jonah,
you are blessed! No human revealed this
to you, but my Father in heaven revealed
it to you.MATTHEW 16
89
18 You are Peter, and I can guarantee
that on this rock I will build my church.
And the gates of hell will not overpower
it.
19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom
of heaven. Whatever you imprison, God
will imprison. And whatever you set free,
God will set free."
20 Then he strictly ordered the disciples
not to tell anyone that he was the
Messiah.
21 From that me on Jesus began to
inform his disciples that he had to go
to Jerusalem. There he would have
to suﬀer a lot because of the leaders,
chief priests, and scribes. He would be
killed, but on the third day he would be
brought back to life.
22 Peter took him aside and objected to
this. He said, "Heaven forbid, Lord! This
must never happen to you!"MATTHEW 16
90
23 But Jesus turned and said to Peter,
"Get out of my way, Satan! You are
temp ng me to sin. You aren’t thinking
the way God thinks but the way humans
think."
24 Then Jesus said to his disciples,
"Those who want to come with me must
say no to the things they want, pick up
their crosses, and follow me.
25 Those who want to save their lives
will lose them. But those who lose their
lives for me will ﬁnd them.
26 What good will it do for people to
win the whole world and lose their lives?
Or what will a person give in exchange
for life?
27 The Son of Man will come with his
angels in his Father’s glory. Then he will
pay back each person based on what
that person has done.
28 I can guarantee this truth: Some
people who are standing here will notMATTHEW 17
91
die un l they see the Son of Man coming
in his kingdom."
1 A er six days Jesus took Peter,
James, and John (the brother of
James) and led them up a high mountain
where they could be alone.
2 Jesus’ appearance changed in front of
them. His face became as bright as the
sun and his clothes as white as light.
3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared
to them and were talking with Jesus.
4 Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it’s good
that we’re here. If you want, I’ll put up
three tents here––one for you, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah."
5 He was s ll speaking when a bright
cloud overshadowed them. Then a voice
came out of the cloud and said, "This is
my Son, whom I love and with whom I
am pleased. Listen to him!"
17MATTHEW 17
92
6 The disciples were terriﬁed when they
heard this and fell facedown on the
ground.
7 But Jesus touched them and said,
"Get up, and don’t be afraid!"
8 As they raised their heads, they saw
no one but Jesus.
9 On their way down the mountain,
Jesus ordered them, "Don’t tell anyone
what you have seen. Wait un l the Son
of Man has been brought back to life."
10 So the disciples asked him, "Why do
the scribes say that Elijah must come
ﬁrst?"
11 Jesus answered, "Elijah is coming and
will put everything in order again.
12 Actually, I can guarantee that Elijah
has already come. Yet, people treated
him as they pleased because they didn’t
recognize him. In the same way they’re
going to make the Son of Man suﬀer."MATTHEW 17
93
13 Then the disciples understood that
he was talking about John the Bap zer.
14 When they came to a crowd, a man
came up to Jesus, knelt in front of him,
15 and said, "Sir, have mercy on my son.
He suﬀers from seizures. O en he falls
into ﬁre or water.
16 I brought him to your disciples, but
they couldn’t cure him."
17 Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and
corrupt genera on! How long must I be
with you? How long must I put up with
you? Bring him here to me!"
18 Jesus ordered the demon to come
out of the boy. At that moment the boy
was cured.
19 Then the disciples came to Jesus
privately and asked, "Why couldn’t we
force the demon out of the boy?"
20 He told them, "Because you have so
li le faith. I can guarantee this truth: If
your faith is the size of a mustard seed,MATTHEW 17
94
you can say to this mountain, ‘Move
from here to there,’ and it will move.
Nothing will be impossible for you."
21 (OMITTED TEXT)
22 While they were traveling together
in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of
Man will be betrayed and handed over
to people.
23 They will kill him, but on the third
day he will be brought back to life." Then
the disciples became very sad.
24 When they came to Capernaum,
the collectors of the temple tax came
to Peter. They asked him, "Doesn’t your
teacher pay the temple tax?"
25 "Certainly," he answered. Peter went
into the house. Before he could speak,
Jesus asked him, "What do you think,
Simon? From whom do the kings of the
world collect fees or taxes? Is it from
their family members or from other
people?"MATTHEW 17 – 18
95
26 "From other people," Peter
answered. Jesus said to him, "Then the
family members are exempt.
27 However, so that we don’t create a
scandal, go to the sea and throw in a
hook. Take the ﬁrst ﬁsh that you catch.
Open its mouth, and you will ﬁnd a coin.
Give that coin to them for you and me."
1 At that me the disciples came
to Jesus and asked, "Who is
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
2 He called a li le child and had him
stand among them.
3 Then he said to them, "I can guarantee
this truth: Unless you change and
become like li le children, you will never
enter the kingdom of heaven.
4 Whoever becomes like this li le child
is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
5 And whoever welcomes a child like
this in my name welcomes me.
18MATTHEW 18
6 "These li
96
le ones believe in me.
It would be best for the person who
causes one of them to lose faith to be
drowned in the sea with a large stone
hung around his neck.
7 How horrible it will be for the world
because it causes people to lose their
faith. Situa ons that cause people to
lose their faith will arise. How horrible
it will be for the person who causes
someone to lose his faith!
8 "If your hand or your foot causes you
to lose your faith, cut it oﬀ and throw
it away. It is be er for you to enter life
disabled or injured than to have two
hands or two feet and be thrown into
everlas ng ﬁre.
9 If your eye causes you to lose your
faith, tear it out and throw it away. It is
be er for you to enter life with one eye
than to have two eyes and be thrown
into hellﬁre.MATTHEW 18
10 "Be careful not to despise these li
97
le
ones. I can guarantee that their angels in
heaven always see the face of my Father,
who is in heaven.
11 (OMITTED TEXT)
12 "What do you think? Suppose a man
has 100 sheep and one of them strays.
Won’t he leave the 99 sheep in the hills
to look for the one that has strayed?
13 I can guarantee this truth: If he ﬁnds
it, he is happier about it than about the
99 that have not strayed.
14 In the same way, your Father in
heaven does not want one of these li le
ones to be lost.
15 "If a believer does something wrong,
go, confront him when the two of you
are alone. If he listens to you, you have
won back that believer.
16 But if he does not listen, take one
or two others with you so that everyMATTHEW 18
98
accusa on may be veriﬁed by two or
three witnesses.
17 If he ignores these witnesses, tell it
to the community of believers. If he also
ignores the community, deal with him as
you would a heathen or a tax collector.
18 I can guarantee this truth: Whatever
you imprison, God will imprison. And
whatever you set free, God will set free.
19 "I can guarantee again that if two of
you agree on anything here on earth, my
Father in heaven will accept it.
20 Where two or three have come
together in my name, I am there among
them."
21 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked
him, "Lord, how o en do I have to
forgive a believer who wrongs me?
Seven mes?"
22 Jesus answered him, "I tell you, not
just seven mes, but seventy mes
seven.MATTHEW 18
99
23 "That is why the kingdom of heaven
is like a king who wanted to se le
accounts with his servants.
24 When he began to do this, a servant
who owed him millions of dollars was
brought to him.
25 Because he could not pay oﬀ the
debt, the master ordered him, his wife,
his children, and all that he had to be
sold to pay oﬀ the account.
26 Then the servant fell at his master’s
feet and said, ‘Be pa ent with me, and I
will repay everything!’
27 "The master felt sorry for his servant,
freed him, and canceled his debt.
28 But when that servant went away, he
found a servant who owed him hundreds
of dollars. He grabbed the servant he
found and began to choke him. ‘Pay
what you owe!’ he said.MATTHEW 18
100
29 "Then that other servant fell at his
feet and begged him, ‘Be pa ent with
me, and I will repay you.’
30 But he refused. Instead, he turned
away and had that servant put into
prison un l he would repay what he
owed.
31 "The other servants who worked
with him saw what had happened and
felt very sad. They told their master the
whole story.
32 "Then his master sent for him and
said to him, ‘You evil servant! I canceled
your en re debt, because you begged
me.
33 Shouldn’t you have treated the other
servant as mercifully as I treated you?’
34 "His master was so angry that he
handed him over to the torturers un l he
would repay everything that he owed.MATTHEW 18 – 19
101
35 That is what my Father in heaven
will do to you if each of you does not
sincerely forgive other believers."
1 When Jesus ﬁnished speaking,
he le Galilee and traveled along
the other side of the Jordan River to the
territory of Judea.
2 Large crowds followed him, and he
healed them there.
3 Some Pharisees came to test him.
They asked, "Can a man divorce his wife
for any reason?"
4 Jesus answered, "Haven’t you read
that the Creator made them male and
female in the beginning
5 and that he said, ‘That’s why a man
will leave his father and mother and will
remain united with his wife, and the two
will be one’?
6 So they are no longer two but one.
Therefore, don’t let anyone separate
what God has joined together."
19MATTHEW 19
102
7 The Pharisees asked him, "Why, then,
did Moses order a man to give his wife a
wri en no ce to divorce her?"
8 Jesus answered them, "Moses allowed
you to divorce your wives because you’re
heartless. It was never this way in the
beginning.
9 I can guarantee that whoever divorces
his wife for any reason other than her
unfaithfulness is commi ng adultery if
he marries another woman."
10 The disciples said to him, "If that is
the only reason a man can use to divorce
his wife, it’s be er not to get married."
11 He answered them, "Not everyone
can do what you suggest. Only those
who have that gi can.
12 For example, some men are celibate
because they were born that way.
Others are celibate because they were
castrated. S ll others have decided to
be celibate because of the kingdom ofMATTHEW 19
103
heaven. If anyone can do what you’ve
suggested, then he should do it."
13 Then some people brought li le
children to Jesus to have him bless them
and pray for them. But the disciples told
the people not to do that.
14 Jesus said, "Don’t stop children from
coming to me! Children like these are
part of the kingdom of God."
15 A er Jesus blessed them, he went
away from there.
16 Then a man came to Jesus and said,
"Teacher, what good deed should I do to
gain eternal life?"
17 Jesus said to him, "Why do you ask
me about what is good? There is only
one who is good. If you want to enter
into life, obey the commandments."
18 "Which commandments?" the man
asked. Jesus said, "Never murder. Never
commit adultery. Never steal. Never give
false tes mony.MATTHEW 19
104
19 Honor your father and mother. Love
your neighbor as you love yourself."
20 The young man replied, "I have
obeyed all these commandments. What
else do I need to do?"
21 Jesus said to him, "If you want to
be perfect, sell what you own. Give the
money to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then follow me!"
22 When the young man heard this, he
went away sad because he owned a lot
of property.
23 Jesus said to his disciples, "I can
guarantee this truth: It will be hard for
a rich person to enter the kingdom of
heaven.
24 I can guarantee again that it is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for a rich person to enter
the kingdom of God."MATTHEW 19
105
25 He amazed his disciples more than
ever when they heard this. "Then who
can be saved?" they asked.
26 Jesus looked at them and said,
"It is impossible for people to save
themselves, but everything is possible
for God."
27 Then Peter replied to him, "Look,
we’ve given up everything to follow you.
What will we get out of it?"
28 Jesus said to them, "I can guarantee
this truth: When the Son of Man sits on
his glorious throne in the world to come,
you, my followers, will also sit on twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.
29 And everyone who gave up homes,
brothers or sisters, father, mother,
children, or ﬁelds because of my name
will receive a hundred mes more and
will inherit eternal life.MATTHEW 19 – 20
106
30 However, many who are ﬁrst will be
last, and many who are last will be ﬁrst.
1 "The kingdom of heaven is
like a landowner who went out
at daybreak to hire workers for his
vineyard.
2 A er agreeing to pay the workers the
usual day’s wages, he sent them to work
in his vineyard.
3 About 9 a.m. he saw others standing
in the marketplace without work.
4 He said to them, ‘Work in my vineyard,
and I’ll give you whatever is right.’ So
they went.
5 "He went out again about noon and 3
p.m. and did the same thing.
6 About 5 p.m. he went out and found
some others standing around. He said to
them, ‘Why are you standing here all day
long without work?’
20MATTHEW 20
107
7 "’No one has hired us,’ they answered
him. "He said to them, ‘Work in my
vineyard.’
8 "When evening came, the owner of
the vineyard told the supervisor, ‘Call
the workers, and give them their wages.
Start with the last, and end with the
ﬁrst.’
9 "Those who started working about 5
p.m. came, and each received a day’s
wages.
10 When those who had been hired ﬁrst
came, they expected to receive more.
But each of them received a day’s wages.
11 Although they took it, they began to
protest to the owner.
12 They said, ‘These last workers have
worked only one hour. Yet, you’ve
treated us all the same, even though we
worked hard all day under a blazing sun.’
13 "The owner said to one of them,
‘Friend, I’m not trea ng you unfairly.MATTHEW 20
108
Didn’t you agree with me on a day’s
wages?
14 Take your money and go! I want to
give this last worker as much as I gave
you.
15 Can’t I do what I want with my own
money? Or do you resent my generosity
towards others?’
16 "In this way the last will be ﬁrst, and
the ﬁrst will be last."
17 When Jesus was on his way to
Jerusalem, he took the twelve apostles
aside and said to them privately,
18 "We’re going to Jerusalem. There the
Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief
priests and scribes. They will condemn
him to death
19 and hand him over to foreigners.
They will make fun of him, whip him,
and crucify him. But on the third day he
will be brought back to life."MATTHEW 20
109
20 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons
came to Jesus with her two sons. She
bowed down in front of him to ask him
for a favor.
21 "What do you want?" he asked her.
She said to him, "Promise that one of my
sons will sit at your right and the other
at your le in your kingdom."
22 Jesus replied, "You don’t realize what
you’re asking. Can you drink the cup that
I’m going to drink?" "We can," they told
him.
23 Jesus said to them, "You will drink
my cup. But I don’t have the authority
to grant you a seat at my right or le .
My Father has already prepared these
posi ons for certain people."
24 When the other ten apostles heard
about this, they were irritated with the
two brothers.
25 Jesus called the apostles and said,
"You know that the rulers of na onsMATTHEW 20
110
have absolute power over people and
their oﬃcials have absolute authority
over people.
26 But that’s not the way it’s going to be
among you. Whoever wants to become
great among you will be your servant.
27 Whoever wants to be most important
among you will be your slave.
28 It’s the same way with the Son of
Man. He didn’t come so that others
could serve him. He came to serve and
to give his life as a ransom for many
people."
29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large
crowd followed Jesus.
30 Two blind men were si ng by the
road. When they heard that Jesus was
passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of
David, have mercy on us!"
31 The crowd told them to be quiet. But
they shouted even louder, "Lord, Son of
David, have mercy on us!"MATTHEW 20 – 21
111
32 Jesus stopped and called them.
"What do you want me to do for you?"
he asked.
33 They told him, "Lord, we want you to
give us our eyesight back."
34 Jesus felt sorry for them, so he
touched their eyes. Their sight was
restored at once, and they followed him.
1 When they came near Jerusalem
and had reached Bethphage on
the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two
disciples ahead of him.
2 He said to them, "Go into the village
ahead of you. You will ﬁnd a donkey ed
there and a colt with it. Un e them, and
bring them to me.
3 If anyone says anything to you, tell
him that the Lord needs them. That
person will send them at once."
4 This happened so that what the
prophet had said came true:
21MATTHEW 21
112
5 "Tell the people of Zion, ‘Your king is
coming to you. He’s gentle, riding on a
donkey, on a colt, a young pack animal.’"
6 The disciples did as Jesus had directed
them.
7 They brought the donkey and the colt
and put their coats on them for Jesus to
sit on.
8 Most of the people spread their coats
on the road. Others cut branches from
the trees and spread them on the road.
9 The crowd that went ahead of him
and that followed him was shou ng,
"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is
the one who comes in the name of the
Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
10 When Jesus came into Jerusalem, the
whole city was in an uproar. People were
asking, "Who is this?"
11 The crowd answered, "This is the
prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."MATTHEW 21
113
12 Jesus went into the temple courtyard
and threw out everyone who was buying
and selling there. He overturned the
moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of
those who sold pigeons.
13 He told them, "Scripture says, ‘My
house will be called a house of prayer,’
but you’re turning it into a gathering
place for thieves!"
14 Blind and lame people came to him
in the temple courtyard, and he healed
them.
15 When the chief priests and the
scribes saw the amazing miracles he
performed and the children shou ng in
the temple courtyard, "Hosanna to the
Son of David!" they were irritated.
16 They said to him, "Do you hear what
these children are saying?" Jesus replied,
"Yes, I do. Have you never read, ‘From
the mouths of li le children and infants,
you have created praise’?"MATTHEW 21
17 He le
114
them and went out of the city
to Bethany and spent the night there.
18 In the morning, as Jesus returned to
the city, he became hungry.
19 When he saw a ﬁg tree by the
road, he went up to the tree and found
nothing on it but leaves. He said to
the tree, "May fruit never grow on you
again!" At once the ﬁg tree dried up.
20 The disciples were surprised to see
this. They asked, "How did the ﬁg tree
dry up so quickly?"
21 Jesus answered them, "I can
guarantee this truth: If you have faith
and do not doubt, you will be able to do
what I did to the ﬁg tree. You could also
say to this mountain, ‘Be uprooted and
thrown into the sea,’ and it will happen.
22 Have faith that you will receive
whatever you ask for in prayer."
23 Then Jesus went into the temple
courtyard and began to teach. The chiefMATTHEW 21
115
priests and the leaders of the people
came to him. They asked, "What gives
you the right to do these things? Who
told you that you could do this?"
24 Jesus answered them, "I, too, have
a ques on for you. If you answer it for
me, I’ll tell you why I have the right to do
these things.
25 Did John’s right to bap ze come
from heaven or from humans?" They
discussed this among themselves. They
said, "If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will ask
us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’
26 But if we say, ‘from humans,’ we’re
afraid of what the crowd might do. All
those people think of John as a prophet."
27 So they answered Jesus, "We don’t
know." Jesus told them, "Then I won’t
tell you why I have the right to do these
things.
28 "What do you think about this? A
man had two sons. He went to the ﬁrstMATTHEW 21
116
and said, ‘Son, go to work in the vineyard
today.’
29 "His son replied, ‘I don’t want to!’
But later he changed his mind and went.
30 "The father went to the other son
and told him the same thing. He replied,
‘I will, sir,’ but he didn’t go.
31 "Which of the two sons did what
the father wanted?" "The ﬁrst," they
answered. Jesus said to them, "I can
guarantee this truth: Tax collectors and
pros tutes are going into the kingdom
of God ahead of you.
32 John came to you and showed you
the way that God wants you to live, but
you didn’t believe him. The tax collectors
and pros tutes believed him. But even
a er you had seen that, you didn’t
change your minds and believe him.
33 "Listen to another illustra on. A
landowner planted a vineyard. He put a
wall around it, made a winepress, andMATTHEW 21
117
built a watchtower. Then he leased it to
vineyard workers and went on a trip.
34 "When the grapes were ge ng ripe,
he sent his servants to the workers to
collect his share of the produce.
35 The workers took his servants and
beat one, killed another, and stoned a
third to death.
36 So the landowner sent more
servants. But the workers treated them
the same way.
37 "Finally, he sent his son to them. He
thought, ‘They will respect my son.’
38 "When the workers saw his son, they
said to one another, ‘This is the heir.
Let’s kill him and get his inheritance.’
39 So they grabbed him, threw him out
of the vineyard, and killed him.
40 "Now, when the owner of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those
workers?"MATTHEW 21
118
41 They answered, "He will destroy
those evil people. Then he will lease the
vineyard to other workers who will give
him his share of the produce when it is
ready."
42 Jesus asked them, "Have you never
read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that
the builders rejected has become the
cornerstone. The Lord is responsible for
this, and it is amazing for us to see’?
43 That is why I can guarantee that
the kingdom of God will be taken away
from you and given to a people who will
produce what God wants.
44 Anyone who falls on this stone will
be broken. If the stone falls on anyone, it
will crush that person."
45 When the chief priests and the
Pharisees heard his illustra ons, they
knew that he was talking about them.MATTHEW 21 – 22
119
46 They wanted to arrest him but were
afraid of the crowds, who thought he
was a prophet.
1 Again Jesus used stories as
illustra ons when he spoke to
them. He said,
2 "The kingdom of heaven is like a king
who planned a wedding for his son.
3 He sent his servants to those who had
been invited to the wedding, but they
refused to come.
4 He sent other servants to tell the
people who had been invited, ‘I’ve
prepared dinner. My bulls and fa ened
calves have been butchered. Everything
is ready. Come to the wedding!’
5 "But they paid no a en on and
went away. Some went to work in their
own ﬁelds, and others went to their
businesses.
6 The rest grabbed the king’s servants,
mistreated them, and then killed them.
22MATTHEW 22
120
7 "The king became angry. He sent his
soldiers, killed those murderers, and
burned their city.
8 "Then the king said to his servants,
‘The wedding is ready, but those who
were invited don’t deserve the honor.
9 Go where the roads leave the city.
Invite everyone you ﬁnd to the wedding.’
10 The servants went into the streets
and brought in all the good people and
all the evil people they found. And the
wedding hall was ﬁlled with guests.
11 "When the king came to see the
guests, he saw a person who was not
dressed in the wedding clothes provided
for the guests.
12 He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you
get in here without proper wedding
clothes?’ "The man had nothing to say.
13 Then the king told his servants,
‘Tie his hands and feet, and throw himMATTHEW 22
121
outside into the darkness. People will
cry and be in extreme pain there.’
14 "Therefore, many are invited, but few
of those are chosen to stay."
15 Then the Pharisees went away and
planned to trap Jesus into saying the
wrong thing.
16 They sent their disciples to him along
with Herod’s followers. They said to him,
"Teacher, we know that you tell the truth
and that you teach the truth about the
way of God. You don’t favor individuals
because of who they are.
17 So tell us what you think. Is it right to
pay taxes to the emperor or not?"
18 Jesus recognized their evil plan, so
he asked, "Why do you test me, you
hypocrites?
19 Show me a coin used to pay taxes."
They brought him a coin.
20 He said to them, "Whose face and
name is this?"MATTHEW 22
122
21 They replied, "The emperor’s." Then
he said to them, "Very well, give the
emperor what belongs to the emperor,
and give God what belongs to God."
22 They were surprised to hear this.
Then they le him alone and went away.
23 On that day some Sadducees, who
say that people will never come back to
life, came to Jesus. They asked him,
24 "Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies
childless, his brother should marry his
widow and have children for his brother.’
25 There were seven brothers among
us. The ﬁrst married and died. Since he
had no children, he le his widow to his
brother.
26 The second brother also died, as well
as the third, and the rest of the seven
brothers.
27 At last the woman died.MATTHEW 22
123
28 Now, when the dead come back to
life, whose wife will she be? All seven
brothers had been married to her."
29 Jesus answered, "You’re mistaken
because you don’t know the Scriptures
or God’s power.
30 When people come back to life, they
don’t marry. Rather, they are like the
angels in heaven.
31 Haven’t you read what God told you
about the dead coming back to life? He
said,
32 ’I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob.’ He’s not the God of the dead but
of the living."
33 He amazed the crowds who heard his
teaching.
34 When the Pharisees heard that
Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they
gathered together.
35 One of them, an expert in Moses’
Teachings, tested Jesus by asking,MATTHEW 22
124
36 "Teacher, which commandment is
the greatest in Moses’ Teachings?"
37 Jesus answered him, "’Love the Lord
your God with all your heart, with all
your soul, and with all your mind.’
38 This is the greatest and most
important commandment.
39 The second is like it: ‘Love your
neighbor as you love yourself.’
40 All of Moses’ Teachings and
the Prophets depend on these two
commandments."
41 While the Pharisees were s ll
gathered, Jesus asked them,
42 "What do you think about the
Messiah? Whose son is he?" They
answered him, "David’s."
43 He said to them, "Then how can
David, guided by the Spirit, call him
Lord? David says,MATTHEW 22 – 23
125
44 ’The Lord said to my Lord, "Take the
highest posi on in heaven un l I put
your enemies under your control."’
45 If David calls him Lord, how can he
be his son?"
46 No one could answer him, and from
that me on no one dared to ask him
another ques on.
1 Then Jesus said to the crowds
and to his disciples,
2 "The scribes and the Pharisees teach
with Moses’ authority.
3 So be careful to do everything they
tell you. But don’t follow their example,
because they don’t prac ce what they
preach.
4 They make loads that are hard to carry
and lay them on the shoulders of the
people. However, they are not willing to
li a ﬁnger to move them.
5 "They do everything to a ract
people’s a en on. They make their
23MATTHEW 23
126
headbands large and the tassels on their
shawls long.
6 They love the place of honor at dinners
and the front seats in synagogues.
7 They love to be greeted in the
marketplaces and to have people call
them Rabbi.
8 But don’t make others call you Rabbi,
because you have only one teacher, and
you are all followers.
9 And don’t call anyone on earth your
father, because you have only one
Father, and he is in heaven.
10 Don’t make others call you a leader,
because you have only one leader, the
Messiah.
11 The person who is greatest among
you will be your servant.
12 Whoever honors himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself
will be honored.MATTHEW 23
127
13 "How horrible it will be for you,
scribes and Pharisees! You hypocrites!
You lock people out of the kingdom of
heaven. You don’t enter it yourselves,
and you don’t permit others to enter
when they try.
14 (OMITTED TEXT)
15 "How horrible it will be for you,
scribes and Pharisees! You hypocrites!
You cross land and sea to recruit a single
follower, and when you do, you make
that person twice as ﬁt for hell as you
are.
16 "How horrible it will be for you, you
blind guides! You say, ‘To swear an oath
by the temple doesn’t mean a thing.
But to swear an oath by the gold in the
temple means a person must keep his
oath.’
17 You blind fools! What is more
important, the gold or the temple that
made the gold holy?MATTHEW 23
128
18 Again you say, ‘To swear an oath by
the altar doesn’t mean a thing. But to
swear an oath by the gi on the altar
means a person must keep his oath.’
19 You blind men! What is more
important, the gi or the altar that
makes the gi holy?
20 To swear an oath by the altar is to
swear by it and by everything on it.
21 To swear an oath by the temple is
to swear by it and by the one who lives
there.
22 And to swear an oath by heaven is to
swear by God’s throne and the one who
sits on it.
23 "How horrible it will be for you,
scribes and Pharisees! You hypocrites!
You give God one–tenth of your mint,
dill, and cumin. But you have neglected
jus ce, mercy, and faithfulness. These
are the most important things in Moses’MATTHEW 23
129
Teachings. You should have done these
things without neglec ng the others.
24 You blind guides! You strain gnats out
of your wine, but you swallow camels.
25 "How horrible it will be for you,
scribes and Pharisees! You hypocrites!
You clean the outside of cups and dishes.
But inside they are full of greed and
uncontrolled desires.
26 You blind Pharisees! First clean the
inside of the cups and dishes so that the
outside may also be clean.
27 "How horrible it will be for you,
scribes and Pharisees! You hypocrites!
You are like whitewashed graves that
look beau ful on the outside but inside
are full of dead people’s bones and every
kind of impurity.
28 So on the outside you look as though
you have God’s approval, but inside you
are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.MATTHEW 23
130
29 "How horrible it will be for you,
scribes and Pharisees! You hypocrites!
You build tombs for the prophets and
decorate the monuments of those who
had God’s approval.
30 Then you say, ‘If we had lived at the
me of our ancestors, we would not
have helped to murder the prophets.’
31 So you tes fy against yourselves that
you are the descendants of those who
murdered the prophets.
32 Go ahead, ﬁnish what your ancestors
started!
33 "You snakes! You poisonous snakes!
How can you escape being condemned
to hell?
34 I’m sending you prophets, wise men,
and teachers of the Scriptures. You will
kill and crucify some of them. Others
you will whip in your synagogues and
persecute from city to city.MATTHEW 23
131
35 As a result, you will be held
accountable for all the innocent blood
of those murdered on earth, from the
murder of righteous Abel to that of
Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you
murdered between the temple and the
altar.
36 I can guarantee this truth: The people
living now will be held accountable for
all these things.
37 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the
prophets and stone to death those sent
to you! How o en I wanted to gather
your children together the way a hen
gathers her chicks under her wings! But
you were not willing!
38 Your house will be abandoned,
deserted.
39 I can guarantee that you will not
see me again un l you say, ‘Blessed is
the one who comes in the name of the
Lord!’"MATTHEW 24
1 As Jesus le
132
the temple
courtyard and was walking away,
his disciples came to him. They proudly
pointed out to him the temple buildings.
2 Jesus said to them, "You see all these
buildings, don’t you? I can guarantee
this truth: Not one of these stones will
be le on top of another. Each one will
be torn down."
3 As Jesus was si ng on the Mount
of Olives, his disciples came to him
privately and said, "Tell us, when will
this happen? What will be the sign that
you are coming again, and when will the
world come to an end?"
4 Jesus answered them, "Be careful not
to let anyone deceive you.
5 Many will come using my name. They
will say, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and they will
deceive many people.
6 "You will hear of wars and rumors of
wars. Don’t be alarmed! These things
24MATTHEW 24
133
must happen, but they don’t mean that
the end has come.
7 Na on will ﬁght against na on and
kingdom against kingdom. There will
be famines and earthquakes in various
places.
8 All of these are only the beginning
pains of the end.
9 "Then they will hand you over to
those who will torture and kill you. All
na ons will hate you because you are
commi ed to me.
10 Then many will lose faith. They will
betray and hate each other.
11 Many false prophets will appear and
deceive many people.
12 And because there will be more and
more lawlessness, most people’s love
will grow cold.
13 But the person who endures to the
end will be saved.MATTHEW 24
134
14 "This Good News about the kingdom
will be spread throughout the world as
a tes mony to all na ons. Then the end
will come.
15 "The prophet Daniel said that
the disgus ng thing that will cause
destruc on will stand in the holy place.
When you see this (let the reader take
note),
16 those of you in Judea should ﬂee to
the mountains.
17 Those who are on the roof should
not come down to get anything out of
their houses.
18 Those who are in the ﬁeld should not
turn back to get their coats.
19 "How horrible it will be for the
women who are pregnant or who are
nursing babies in those days.
20 Pray that it will not be winter or a day
of worship when you ﬂee.MATTHEW 24
135
21 There will be a lot of misery at that
me, a kind of misery that has not
happened from the beginning of the
world un l now and will certainly never
happen again.
22 If God does not reduce the number
of those days, no one will be saved. But
those days will be reduced because of
those whom God has chosen.
23 "At that me don’t believe anyone
who tells you, ‘Here is the Messiah!’ or
‘There he is!’
24 False messiahs and false prophets
will appear. They will work spectacular,
miraculous signs and do wonderful
things to deceive, if possible, even those
whom God has chosen.
25 Listen! I’ve told you this before it
happens.
26 So if someone tells you, ‘He’s in the
desert!’ don’t go out looking for him.MATTHEW 24
136
And don’t believe anyone who says,
‘He’s in a secret place!’
27 The Son of Man will come again just
as lightning ﬂashes from east to west.
28 Vultures will gather wherever there
is a dead body.
29 "Immediately a er the misery of
those days, the sun will turn dark, the
moon will not give light, the stars will
fall from the sky, and the powers of the
universe will be shaken.
30 "Then the sign of the Son of Man
will appear in the sky. All the people on
earth will cry in agony when they see the
Son of Man coming on the clouds in the
sky with power and great glory.
31 He will send out his angels with
a loud trumpet call, and from every
direc on under the sky, they will gather
those whom God has chosen.
32 "Learn from the story of the ﬁg tree.
When its branch becomes tender and itMATTHEW 24
137
sprouts leaves, you know that summer is
near.
33 In the same way, when you see all
these things, you know that he is near,
at the door.
34 "I can guarantee this truth: This
genera on will not disappear un l all
these things take place.
35 The earth and the heavens will
disappear, but my words will never
disappear.
36 "No one knows when that day or
hour will come. Even the angels in
heaven and the Son don’t know. Only
the Father knows.
37 "When the Son of Man comes again,
it will be exactly like the days of Noah.
38 In the days before the ﬂood, people
were ea ng, drinking, and ge ng
married un l the day that Noah went
into the ship.MATTHEW 24
138
39 They were not aware of what was
happening un l the ﬂood came and
swept all of them away. That is how it
will be when the Son of Man comes
again.
40 "At that me two men will be
working in the ﬁeld. One will be taken,
and the other one will be le .
41 Two women will be working at a mill.
One will be taken, and the other one will
be le .
42 "Therefore, be alert, because you
don’t know on what day your Lord will
return.
43 You realize that if a homeowner
had known at what me of the night a
thief was coming, he would have stayed
awake. He would not have let the thief
break into his house.
44 Therefore, you, too, must be ready
because the Son of Man will return when
you least expect him.MATTHEW 24 – 25
139
45 "Who, then, is the faithful and wise
servant? The master will put that person
in charge of giving the other servants
their food at the right me.
46 That servant will be blessed if his
master ﬁnds him doing this job when he
comes.
47 I can guarantee this truth: He will put
that servant in charge of all his property.
48 On the other hand, that servant, if he
is wicked, may think that it will be a long
me before his master comes.
49 The servant may begin to beat the
other servants and eat and drink with
the drunks.
50 His master will return unexpectedly.
51 Then his master will severely punish
him and assign him a place with the
hypocrites. People will cry and be in
extreme pain there.

kingdom of heaven will be like ten

and went to meet the groom.
2 Five of them were foolish, and ﬁve
were wise.
3 The foolish bridesmaids took their
lamps, but they didn’t take any extra oil.
4 The wise bridesmaids, however, took
along extra oil for their lamps.
5 Since the groom was late, all the
bridesmaids became drowsy and fell
asleep.
6 "At midnight someone shouted, ‘The
groom is here! Come to meet him!’
7 Then all the bridesmaids woke up and
got their lamps ready.
8 "The foolish ones said to the wise
ones, ‘Give us some of your oil. Our
lamps are going out.’
9 "But the wise bridesmaids replied,
‘We can’t do that. There won’t be
enough for both of us. Go! Find someone
to sell you some oil.’MATTHEW 25
141
10 "While they were buying oil, the
groom arrived. The bridesmaids who
were ready went with him into the
wedding hall, and the door was shut.
11 "Later the other bridesmaids arrived
and said, ‘Sir, sir, open the door for us!’
12 "But he answered them, ‘I don’t even
know who you are!’
13 "So stay awake, because you don’t
know the day or the hour.
14 "The kingdom of heaven is like a man
going on a trip. He called his servants
and entrusted some money to them.
15 He gave one man ten thousand
dollars, another four thousand dollars,
and another two thousand dollars. Each
was given money based on his ability.
Then the man went on his trip.
16 "The one who received ten thousand
dollars invested the money at once and
doubled his money.MATTHEW 25
142
17 The one who had four thousand
dollars did the same and also doubled
his money.
18 But the one who received two
thousand dollars went oﬀ, dug a hole in
the ground, and hid his master’s money.
19 "A er a long me the master of
those servants returned and se led
accounts with them.
20 The one who received ten thousand
dollars brought the addi onal ten
thousand. He said, ‘Sir, you gave me
ten thousand dollars. I’ve doubled the
amount.’
21 "His master replied, ‘Good job!
You’re a good and faithful servant! You
proved that you could be trusted with
a small amount. I will put you in charge
of a large amount. Come and share your
master’s happiness.’
22 "The one who received four thousand
dollars came and said, ‘Sir, you gave meMATTHEW 25
143
four thousand dollars. I’ve doubled the
amount.’
23 "His master replied, ‘Good job!
You’re a good and faithful servant! You
proved that you could be trusted with
a small amount. I will put you in charge
of a large amount. Come and share your
master’s happiness.’
24 "Then the one who received two
thousand dollars came and said, ‘Sir,
I knew that you are a hard person to
please. You harvest where you haven’t
planted and gather where you haven’t
sca ered any seeds.
25 I was afraid. So I hid your two
thousand dollars in the ground. Here’s
your money!’
26 "His master responded, ‘You evil and
lazy servant! If you knew that I harvest
where I haven’t planted and gather
where I haven’t sca ered,MATTHEW 25
144
27 then you should have invested
my money with the bankers. When I
returned, I would have received my
money back with interest.
28 Take the two thousand dollars away
from him! Give it to the one who has the
ten thousand!
29 To all who have, more will be given,
and they will have more than enough.
But everything will be taken away from
those who don’t have much.
30 Throw this useless servant outside
into the darkness. People will cry and be
in extreme pain there.’
31 "When the Son of Man comes in his
glory and all his angels are with him, he
will sit on his glorious throne.
32 The people of every na on will be
gathered in front of him. He will separate
them as a shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats.MATTHEW 25
145
33 He will put the sheep on his right but
the goats on his le .
34 "Then the king will say to those on
his right, ‘Come, my Father has blessed
you! Inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the crea on of the world.
35 I was hungry, and you gave me
something to eat. I was thirsty, and you
gave me something to drink. I was a
stranger, and you took me into your
home.
36 I needed clothes, and you gave me
something to wear. I was sick, and you
took care of me. I was in prison, and you
visited me.’
37 "Then the people who have God’s
approval will reply to him, ‘Lord, when
did we see you hungry and feed you or
see you thirsty and give you something
to drink?
38 When did we see you as a stranger
and take you into our homes or seeMATTHEW 25
146
you in need of clothes and give you
something to wear?
39 When did we see you sick or in prison
and visit you?’
40 "The king will answer them, ‘I can
guarantee this truth: Whatever you did
for one of my brothers or sisters, no
ma er how unimportant they seemed,
you did for me.’
41 "Then the king will say to those on his
le , ‘Get away from me! God has cursed
you! Go into everlas ng ﬁre that was
prepared for the devil and his angels!
42 I was hungry, and you gave me
nothing to eat. I was thirsty, and you
gave me nothing to drink.
43 I was a stranger, and you didn’t take
me into your homes. I needed clothes,
and you didn’t give me anything to wear.
I was sick and in prison, and you didn’t
take care of me.’MATTHEW 25 – 26
147
44 "They, too, will ask, ‘Lord, when did
we see you hungry or thirsty or as a
stranger or in need of clothes or sick or
in prison and didn’t help you?’
45 "He will answer them, ‘I can
guarantee this truth: Whatever you
failed to do for one of my brothers or
sisters, no ma er how unimportant they
seemed, you failed to do for me.’
46 "These people will go away into
eternal punishment, but those with
God’s approval will go into eternal life."
1 When Jesus ﬁnished saying all
these things, he told his disciples,
2 "You know that the Passover will
take place in two days. At that me the
Son of Man will be handed over to be
cruciﬁed."
3 Then the chief priests and the leaders
of the people gathered in the palace of
the chief priest Caiaphas.
26MATTHEW 26
148
4 They made plans to arrest Jesus in an
underhanded way and to kill him.
5 But they said, "We shouldn’t arrest
him during the fes val, or else there may
be a riot among the people."
6 Jesus was in Bethany in the home of
Simon, a man who had suﬀered from a
skin disease.
7 While Jesus was si ng there, a
woman went to him with a bo le of very
expensive perfume and poured it on his
head.
8 The disciples were irritated when
they saw this. They asked, "Why did she
waste it like this?
9 It could have been sold for a high
price, and the money could have been
given to the poor."
10 Since Jesus knew what was going on,
he said to them, "Why are you bothering
this woman? She has done a beau ful
thing for me.MATTHEW 26
149
11 You will always have the poor with
you, but you will not always have me
with you.
12 She poured this perfume on my body
before it is placed in a tomb.
13 I can guarantee this truth: Wherever
this Good News is spoken in the world,
what she has done will also be told in
memory of her."
14 Then one of the twelve apostles, the
one named Judas Iscariot, went to the
chief priests.
15 He asked, "What will you pay me if
I hand him over to you?" They oﬀered
him 30 silver coins.
16 From then on, he looked for a chance
to betray Jesus.
17 On the ﬁrst day of the Fes val of
Unleavened Bread, the disciples went
to Jesus. They asked, "Where do you
want us to prepare the Passover meal
for you?"MATTHEW 26
150
18 He said, "Go to a certain man in
the city, and tell him that the teacher
says, ‘My me is near. I will celebrate
the Passover with my disciples at your
house.’"
19 The disciples did as Jesus had
directed them and prepared the
Passover.
20 When evening came, Jesus was at
the table with the twelve apostles.
21 While they were ea ng, he said, "I
can guarantee this truth: One of you is
going to betray me."
22 Feeling deeply hurt, they asked him
one by one, "You don’t mean me, do
you, Lord?"
23 Jesus answered, "Someone who has
dipped his hand into the bowl with me
will betray me.
24 The Son of Man is going to die as the
Scriptures say he will. But how horrible
it will be for that person who betrays theMATTHEW 26
151
Son of Man. It would have been be er
for that person if he had never been
born."
25 Then Judas, who betrayed him,
asked, "You don’t mean me, do you,
Rabbi?" "Yes, I do," Jesus replied.
26 While they were ea ng, Jesus took
bread and blessed it. He broke the
bread, gave it to his disciples, and said,
"Take this, and eat it. This is my body."
27 Then he took a cup and spoke a
prayer of thanksgiving. He gave it to
them and said, "Drink from it, all of you.
28 This is my blood, the blood of the
promise. It is poured out for many
people so that sins are forgiven.
29 "I can guarantee that I won’t drink
this wine again un l that day when I
drink new wine with you in my Father’s
kingdom."
30 A er they sang a hymn, they went to
the Mount of Olives.MATTHEW 26
152
31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you
will abandon me tonight. Scripture says,
‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
in the ﬂock will be sca ered.’
32 "But a er I am brought back to life, I
will go to Galilee ahead of you."
33 Peter said to him, "Even if everyone
else abandons you, I never will."
34 Jesus replied to Peter, "I can
guarantee this truth: Before a rooster
crows tonight, you will say three mes
that you don’t know me."
35 Peter told him, "Even if I have to die
with you, I’ll never say that I don’t know
you!" All the other disciples said the
same thing.
36 Then Jesus went with the disciples to
a place called Gethsemane. He said to
them, "Stay here while I go over there
and pray."MATTHEW 26
153
37 He took Peter and Zebedee’s two
sons with him. He was beginning to feel
deep anguish.
38 Then he said to them, "My anguish is
so great that I feel as if I’m dying. Wait
here, and stay awake with me."
39 A er walking a li le farther, he
quickly bowed with his face to the
ground and prayed, "Father, if it’s
possible, let this cup of suﬀering be
taken away from me. But let your will be
done rather than mine."
40 When he went back to the disciples,
he found them asleep. He said to Peter,
"Couldn’t you stay awake with me for
one hour?
41 Stay awake, and pray that you won’t
be tempted. You want to do what’s right,
but you’re weak."
42 Then he went away a second me
and prayed, "Father, if this cup cannotMATTHEW 26
154
be taken away unless I drink it, let your
will be done."
43 He found them asleep again because
they couldn’t keep their eyes open.
44 A er leaving them again, he went
away and prayed the same prayer a third
me.
45 Then he came back to the disciples
and said to them, "You might as well
sleep now. The me is near for the Son
of Man to be handed over to sinners.
46 Get up! Let’s go! The one who is
betraying me is near."
47 Just then, while Jesus was s ll
speaking, Judas, one of the twelve
apostles, arrived. A large crowd carrying
swords and clubs was with him. They
were from the chief priests and leaders
of the people.
48 Now, the traitor had given them a
signal. He said, "The one I kiss is the man
you want. Arrest him!"MATTHEW 26
155
49 Then Judas quickly stepped up to
Jesus and said, "Hello, Rabbi!" and kissed
him.
50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, why
are you here?" Then some men came
forward, took hold of Jesus, and arrested
him.
51 Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus
pulled out his sword and cut oﬀ the ear
of the chief priest’s servant.
52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your
sword away! All who use a sword will be
killed by a sword.
53 Don’t you think that I could call on
my Father to send more than twelve
legions of angels to help me now?
54 How, then, are the Scriptures to be
fulﬁlled that say this must happen?"
55 At that me Jesus said to the crowd,
"Have you come out with swords and
clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal?
I used to sit teaching in the templeMATTHEW 26
156
courtyard every day. But you didn’t
arrest me then.
56 All of this has happened so that what
the prophets have wri en would come
true." Then all the disciples abandoned
him and ran away.
57 Those who had arrested Jesus took
him to Caiaphas, the chief priest, where
the scribes and the leaders had gathered
together.
58 Peter followed at a distance un l he
came to the chief priest’s courtyard. He
went inside and sat with the guards to
see how this would turn out.
59 The chief priests and the whole
council were searching for false
tes mony to use against Jesus in order
to execute him.
60 But they did not ﬁnd any, although
many came forward with false tes mony.
At last two men came forward.MATTHEW 26
157
61 They stated, "This man said, ‘I can
tear down God’s temple and rebuild it in
three days.’"
62 The chief priest stood up and said to
Jesus, "Don’t you have any answer to
what these men tes fy against you?"
63 But Jesus was silent. Then the chief
priest said to him, "Swear an oath in
front of the living God and tell us, are
you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
64 Jesus answered him, "Yes, I am. But
I can guarantee that from now on you
will see the Son of Man in the highest
posi on in heaven. He will be coming on
the clouds of heaven."
65 Then the chief priest tore his robes
in horror and said, "He has dishonored
God! Why do we need any more
witnesses? You’ve just heard him
dishonor God!MATTHEW 26
158
66 What’s your verdict?" They
answered, "He deserves the death
penalty!"
67 Then they spit in his face, hit him with
their ﬁsts, and some of them slapped
him.
68 They said, "You Christ, if you’re a
prophet, tell us who hit you."
69 Peter was si ng in the courtyard. A
female servant came to him and said,
"You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean."
70 But Peter denied it in front of them
all by saying, "I don’t know what you’re
talking about."
71 As he went to the entrance, another
female servant saw him. She told those
who were there, "This man was with
Jesus from Nazareth."
72 Again Peter denied it and swore with
an oath, "I don’t know the man!"
73 A er a li le while the men standing
there approached Peter and said, "It’sMATTHEW 26 – 27
159
obvious you’re also one of them. Your
accent gives you away!"
74 Then Peter began to curse and swear
with an oath, "I don’t know the man!"
Just then a rooster crowed.
75 Peter remembered what Jesus had
said: "Before a rooster crows, you will
say three mes that you don’t know
me." Then Peter went outside and cried
bi erly.
1 Early in the morning all the chief
priests and the leaders of the
people decided to execute Jesus.
2 They ed him up, led him away, and
handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
3 Then Judas, who had betrayed Jesus,
regre ed what had happened when
he saw that Jesus was condemned. He
brought the 30 silver coins back to the
chief priests and leaders.
27MATTHEW 27
160
4 He said, "I’ve sinned by betraying an
innocent man." They replied, "What do
we care? That’s your problem."
5 So he threw the money into the
temple, went away, and hanged himself.
6 The chief priests took the money
and said, "It’s not right to put it into
the temple treasury, because it’s blood
money."
7 So they decided to use it to buy a
po er’s ﬁeld for the burial of strangers.
8 That’s why that ﬁeld has been called
the Field of Blood ever since.
9 Then what the prophet Jeremiah had
said came true, "They took the 30 silver
coins, the price the people of Israel had
placed on him,
10 and used the coins to buy a po er’s
ﬁeld, as the Lord had directed me."
11 Jesus stood in front of the governor,
Pilate. The governor asked him, "Are youMATTHEW 27
161
the king of the Jews?" "Yes, I am," Jesus
answered.
12 While the chief priests and leaders
were accusing him, he said nothing.
13 Then Pilate asked him, "Don’t you
hear how many charges they’re bringing
against you?"
14 But Jesus said absolutely nothing to
him in reply, so the governor was very
surprised.
15 At every Passover fes val the
governor would free one prisoner whom
the crowd wanted.
16 At that me there was a well–known
prisoner by the name of Barabbas.
17 So when the people gathered, Pilate
asked them, "Which man do you want
me to free for you? Do you want me to
free Barabbas or Jesus, who is called
Christ?"MATTHEW 27
162
18 Pilate knew that they had handed
Jesus over to him because they were
jealous.
19 While Pilate was judging the case, his
wife sent him a message. It said, "Leave
that innocent man alone. I’ve been very
upset today because of a dream I had
about him."
20 But the chief priests and leaders
persuaded the crowd to ask for the
release of Barabbas and the execu on of
Jesus.
21 The governor asked them, "Which
of the two do you want me to free for
you?" They said, "Barabbas."
22 Pilate asked them, "Then what
should I do with Jesus, who is called
Christ?" "He should be cruciﬁed!" they
all said.
23 Pilate asked, "Why? What has he
done wrong?" But they began to shout
loudly, "He should be cruciﬁed!"MATTHEW 27
24 Pilate saw that he was not ge
163
ng
anywhere. Instead, a riot was breaking
out. So Pilate took some water and
washed his hands in front of the crowd.
He said, "I won’t be guilty of killing this
man. Do what you want!"
25 All the people answered, "The
responsibility for killing him will rest on
us and our children."
26 Then Pilate freed Barabbas for the
people. But he had Jesus whipped and
handed over to be cruciﬁed.
27 Then the governor’s soldiers took
Jesus into the palace and gathered the
whole troop around him.
28 They took oﬀ his clothes and put a
bright red cape on him.
29 They twisted some thorns into a
crown, placed it on his head, and put a
s ck in his right hand. They knelt in front
of him and made fun of him by saying,
"Long live the king of the Jews!"MATTHEW 27
30 A
164
er they had spit on him, they took
the s ck and kept hi ng him on the
head with it.
31 A er the soldiers ﬁnished making fun
of Jesus, they took oﬀ the cape and put
his own clothes back on him. Then they
led him away to crucify him.
32 On the way they found a man named
Simon. He was from the city of Cyrene.
The soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’
cross.
33 They came to a place called Golgotha
(which means "the place of the skull").
34 They gave him a drink of wine mixed
with a drug called gall. When he tasted
it, he refused to drink it.
35 A er they had cruciﬁed him, they
divided his clothes among themselves
by throwing dice.
36 Then they sat there and kept watch
over him.MATTHEW 27
37 They placed a wri
165
en accusa on
above his head. It read, "This is Jesus,
the king of the Jews."
38 At that me they cruciﬁed two
criminals with him, one on his right and
the other on his le .
39 Those who passed by insulted him.
They shook their heads
40 and said, "You were going to tear
down God’s temple and build it again in
three days. Save yourself! If you’re the
Son of God, come down from the cross."
41 The chief priests together with the
scribes and the leaders made fun of him
in the same way. They said,
42 "He saved others, but he can’t save
himself. So he’s Israel’s king! Let him
come down from the cross now, and
we’ll believe him.
43 He trusted God. Let God rescue him
now if he wants. A er all, this man said,
‘I am the Son of God.’"MATTHEW 27
166
44 Even the criminals cruciﬁed with him
were insul ng him the same way.
45 At noon darkness came over the
whole land un l three in the a ernoon.
46 About three o’clock Jesus cried out in
a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?"
which means, "My God, my God, why
have you abandoned me?"
47 When some of the people standing
there heard him say that, they said, "He’s
calling Elijah."
48 One of the men ran at once, took a
sponge, and soaked it in some vinegar.
Then he put it on a s ck and oﬀered
Jesus a drink.
49 The others said, "Leave him alone!
Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him."
50 Then Jesus loudly cried out once
again and gave up his life.
51 Suddenly, the curtain in the temple
was split in two from top to bo om. TheMATTHEW 27
167
earth shook, and the rocks were split
open.
52 The tombs were opened, and the
bodies of many holy people who had
died came back to life.
53 They came out of the tombs a er he
had come back to life, and they went
into the holy city where they appeared
to many people.
54 An army oﬃcer and those watching
Jesus with him saw the earthquake and
the other things happening. They were
terriﬁed and said, "Certainly, this was
the Son of God!"
55 Many women were there watching
from a distance. They had followed Jesus
from Galilee and had always supported
him.
56 Among them were Mary from
Magdala, Mary (the mother of James
and Joseph), and the mother of
Zebedee’s sons.MATTHEW 27
168
57 In the evening a rich man named
Joseph arrived. He was from the city of
Arimathea and had become a disciple of
Jesus.
58 He went to Pilate and asked for the
body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be
given to him.
59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it
in a clean linen cloth.
60 Then he laid it in his own new tomb,
which had been cut in a rock. A er
rolling a large stone against the door of
the tomb, he went away.
61 Mary from Magdala and the other
Mary were si ng there, facing the tomb.
62 The next day, which was the day of
worship, the chief priests and Pharisees
gathered together and went to Pilate.
63 They said, "Sir, we remember how
that deceiver said while he was s ll alive,
‘A er three days I will be brought back
to life.’MATTHEW 27 – 28
169
64 Therefore, give the order to make
the tomb secure un l the third day.
Otherwise, his disciples may steal him
and say to the people, ‘He has been
brought back to life.’ Then the last
decep on will be worse than the ﬁrst."
65 Pilate told them, "You have the
soldiers you want for guard duty. Go and
make the tomb as secure as you know
how."
66 So they went to secure the tomb.
They placed a seal on the stone and
posted the soldiers on guard duty.
1 A er the day of worship, as the
sun rose Sunday morning, Mary
from Magdala and the other Mary went
to look at the tomb.
2 Suddenly, there was a powerful
earthquake. An angel of the Lord had
come down from heaven, rolled the
stone away, and was si ng on it.
28MATTHEW 28
170
3 He was as bright as lightning, and his
clothes were as white as snow.
4 The guards were so deathly afraid of
him that they shook.
5 The angel said to the women, "Don’t
be afraid! I know you’re looking for
Jesus, who was cruciﬁed.
6 He’s not here. He has been brought
back to life as he said. Come, see the
place where he was lying.
7 Then go quickly, and tell his disciples
that he has been brought back to life.
He’s going ahead of them into Galilee.
There they will see him. Take note that I
have told you."
8 They hurried away from the tomb
with fear and great joy and ran to tell his
disciples.
9 Suddenly, Jesus met them and greeted
them. They went up to him, bowed
down to worship him, and took hold of
his feet.MATTHEW 28
171
10 Then Jesus said to them, "Don’t be
afraid! Go, tell my followers to go to
Galilee. There they will see me."
11 While the women were on their way,
some of the guards went into the city.
They told the chief priests everything
that had happened.
12 The chief priests gathered together
with the leaders and agreed on a plan.
They gave the soldiers a large amount of
money
13 and told them to say that Jesus’
disciples had come at night and had
stolen his body while they were sleeping.
14 They added, "If the governor hears
about it, we’ll take care of it, and you’ll
have nothing to worry about."
15 The soldiers took the money and did
as they were told. Their story has been
spread among the Jewish people to this
day.MATTHEW 28
172
16 The eleven disciples went to the
mountain in Galilee where Jesus had
told them to go.
17 When they saw him, they bowed
down in worship, though some had
doubts.
18 When Jesus came near, he spoke to
them. He said, "All authority in heaven
and on earth has been given to me.
19 So wherever you go, make disciples
of all na ons: Bap ze them in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit.
20 Teach them to do everything I have
commanded you. "And remember that
I am always with you un l the end of
me."Mark
1
1 This is the beginning of the Good
News about Jesus Christ, the Son of
God.
2 The prophet Isaiah wrote, "I am
sending my messenger ahead of you to
prepare the way for you."
3 "A voice cries out in the desert:
‘Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his
paths straight!’"
4 John the Bap zer was in the desert
telling people about a bap sm of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
5 All Judea and all the people of
Jerusalem went to him. As they
confessed their sins, he bap zed them in
the Jordan River.
6 John was dressed in clothes made
from camel’s hair. He wore a leather beltMARK 1
2
around his waist and ate locusts and wild
honey.
7 He announced, "The one who comes
a er me is more powerful than I. I am
not worthy to bend down and un e his
sandal straps.
8 I have bap zed you with water, but he
will bap ze you with the Holy Spirit."
9 At that me Jesus came from Nazareth
in Galilee and was bap zed by John in
the Jordan River.
10 As Jesus came out of the water, he
saw heaven split open and the Spirit
coming down to him as a dove.
11 A voice from heaven said, "You are
my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with
you."
12 At once the Spirit brought him into
the desert,
13 where he was tempted by Satan for
40 days. He was there with the wild
animals, and the angels took care of him.MARK 1
14 A
3
er John had been put in prison,
Jesus went to Galilee and told people
the Good News of God.
15 He said, "The me has come, and the
kingdom of God is near. Change the way
you think and act, and believe the Good
News."
16 As he was going along the Sea of
Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother
Andrew. They were throwing a net into
the sea because they were ﬁshermen.
17 Jesus said to them, "Come, follow
me! I will teach you how to catch people
instead of ﬁsh."
18 They immediately le their nets and
followed him.
19 As Jesus went on a li le farther,
he saw James and John, the sons of
Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing
their nets to go ﬁshing.
20 He immediately called them, and
they le their father Zebedee and theMARK 1
4
hired men in the boat and followed
Jesus.
21 Then they went to Capernaum. On
the next day of worship, Jesus went into
the synagogue and began to teach.
22 The people were amazed at his
teachings. Unlike their scribes, he taught
them with authority.
23 At that me there was a man in the
synagogue who was controlled by an evil
spirit. He shouted,
24 "What do you want with us, Jesus
from Nazareth? Have you come to
destroy us? I know who you are––the
Holy One of God!"
25 Jesus ordered the spirit, "Keep quiet,
and come out of him!"
26 The evil spirit threw the man into
convulsions and came out of him with a
loud shriek.
27 Everyone was stunned. They said to
each other, "What is this? This is a newMARK 1
5
teaching that has authority behind it! He
gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey
him."
28 The news about him spread quickly
throughout the surrounding region of
Galilee.
29 A er they le the synagogue, they
went directly to the house of Simon
and Andrew. James and John went with
them.
30 Simon’s mother–in–law was in bed
with a fever. The ﬁrst thing they did was
to tell Jesus about her.
31 Jesus went to her, took her hand, and
helped her get up. The fever went away,
and she prepared a meal for them.
32 In the evening, when the sun had
set, people brought to him everyone
who was sick and those possessed by
demons.
33 The whole city had gathered at his
door.MARK 1
6
34 He cured many who were sick with
various diseases and forced many
demons out of people. However, he
would not allow the demons to speak.
A er all, they knew who he was.
35 In the morning, long before sunrise,
Jesus went to a place where he could be
alone to pray.
36 Simon and his friends searched for
him.
37 When they found him, they told him,
"Everyone is looking for you."
38 Jesus said to them, "Let’s go
somewhere else, to the small towns that
are nearby. I have to spread the Good
News in them also. This is why I have
come."
39 So he went to spread the Good News
in the synagogues all over Galilee, and
he forced demons out of people.
40 Then a man with a serious skin
disease came to him. The man fell toMARK 1
7
his knees and begged Jesus, "If you’re
willing, you can make me clean."
41 Jesus felt sorry for him, reached out,
touched him, and said, "I’m willing. So
be clean!"
42 Immediately, his skin disease went
away, and he was clean.
43 Jesus sent him away at once and
warned him,
44 "Don’t tell anyone about this!
Instead, show yourself to the priest.
Then oﬀer the sacriﬁces which Moses
commanded as proof to people that you
are clean."
45 When the man le , he began to talk
freely. He spread his story so widely
that Jesus could no longer enter any
city openly. Instead, he stayed in places
where he could be alone. But people s ll
kept coming to him from everywhere.MARK 2
2
8
1 Several days later Jesus came back
to Capernaum. The report went out
that he was home.
2 Many people had gathered. There was
no room le , even in front of the door.
Jesus was speaking God’s word to them.
3 Four men came to him carrying a
paralyzed man.
4 Since they could not bring him to
Jesus because of the crowd, they made
an opening in the roof over the place
where Jesus was. Then they lowered
the cot on which the paralyzed man was
lying.
5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to
the man, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
6 Some scribes were si ng there. They
thought,
7 "Why does he talk this way? He’s
dishonoring God. Who besides God can
forgive sins?"MARK 2
9
8 At once, Jesus knew inwardly what
they were thinking. He asked them,
"Why do you have these thoughts?
9 Is it easier to say to this paralyzed
man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say,
‘Get up, pick up your cot, and walk’?
10 I want you to know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
11 "I’m telling you to get up, pick up
your cot, and go home!"
12 The man got up, immediately picked
up his cot, and walked away while
everyone watched. Everyone was
amazed and praised God, saying, "We
have never seen anything like this."
13 Jesus went to the seashore again.
Large crowds came to him, and he taught
them.
14 When Jesus was leaving, he saw Levi,
son of Alphaeus, si ng in a tax oﬃce.MARK 2
10
Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" So Levi
got up and followed him.
15 Later Jesus was having dinner at
Levi’s house. Many tax collectors and
sinners who were followers of Jesus
were ea ng with him and his disciples.
16 When the scribes who were
Pharisees saw him ea ng with sinners
and tax collectors, they asked his
disciples, "Why does he eat with tax
collectors and sinners?"
17 When Jesus heard that, he said to
them, "Healthy people don’t need a
doctor; those who are sick do. I’ve come
to call sinners, not people who think
they have God’s approval."
18 John’s disciples and the Pharisees
were fas ng. Some people came to Jesus
and said to him, "Why do John’s disciples
and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but
your disciples don’t?"MARK 2
11
19 Jesus replied, "Can wedding guests
fast while the groom is s ll with them?
As long as they have the groom with
them, they cannot fast.
20 But the me will come when the
groom will be taken away from them.
Then they will fast.
21 "No one patches an old coat with
a new piece of cloth that will shrink.
Otherwise, the new patch will shrink and
rip away some of the old cloth, and the
tear will become worse.
22 People don’t pour new wine into old
wineskins. If they do, the wine will make
the skins burst, and both the wine and
the skins will be ruined. Rather, new
wine is to be poured into fresh skins."
23 Once on a day of worship Jesus was
going through the grainﬁelds. As the
disciples walked along, they began to
pick the heads of grain.MARK 2 – 3
12
24 The Pharisees asked him, "Look! Why
are your disciples doing something that
is not permi ed on the day of worship?"
25 Jesus asked them, "Haven’t you ever
read what David did when he and his
men were in need and were hungry?
26 Haven’t you ever read how he went
into the house of God when Abiathar
was chief priest and ate the bread of the
presence? He had no right to eat those
loaves. Only the priests have that right.
Haven’t you ever read how he also gave
some of it to his men?"
27 Then he added, "The day of worship
was made for people, not people for the
day of worship.
28 For this reason the Son of Man has
authority over the day of worship."
1 Jesus went into a synagogue again.
A man who had a paralyzed hand
was there.
3MARK 3
13
2 The people were watching Jesus
closely. They wanted to see whether
he would heal the man on the day of
worship so that they could accuse him of
doing something wrong.
3 So he told the man with the paralyzed
hand, "Stand in the center of the
synagogue."
4 Then he asked them, "Is it right to do
good or to do evil on the day of worship,
to give a person back his health or to let
him die?" But they were silent.
5 Jesus was angry as he looked around
at them. He was deeply hurt because
their minds were closed. Then he told
the man, "Hold out your hand." The man
held it out, and his hand became normal
again.
6 The Pharisees le , and with Herod’s
followers they immediately plo ed to
kill Jesus.MARK 3
7 Jesus le
14
with his disciples for the Sea
of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee,
Judea,
8 Jerusalem, Idumea, and from across
the Jordan River, and from around Tyre
and Sidon followed him. They came
to him because they had heard about
everything he was doing.
9 Jesus told his disciples to have a boat
ready so that the crowd would not crush
him.
10 He had cured so many that everyone
with a disease rushed up to him in order
to touch him.
11 Whenever people with evil spirits
saw him, they would fall down in front
of him and shout, "You are the Son of
God!"
12 He gave them orders not to tell
people who he was.MARK 3
15
13 Jesus went up a mountain, called
those whom he wanted, and they came
to him.
14 He appointed twelve whom he called
apostles. They were to accompany him
and to be sent out by him to spread the
Good News.
15 They also had the authority to force
demons out of people.
16 He appointed these twelve: Simon
(whom Jesus named Peter),
17 James and his brother John
(Zebedee’s sons whom Jesus
named Boanerges, which means
"Thunderbolts"),
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Ma hew, Thomas, James (son of
Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
19 and Judas Iscariot (who later
betrayed Jesus).MARK 3
16
20 Then Jesus went home. Another
crowd gathered so that Jesus and his
disciples could not even eat.
21 When his family heard about it, they
went to get him. They said, "He’s out of
his mind!"
22 The scribes who had come from
Jerusalem said, "Beelzebul is in him,"
and "He forces demons out of people
with the help of the ruler of demons."
23 Jesus called them together and used
this illustra on: "How can Satan force
out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot last.
25 And if a household is divided against
itself, that household will not last.
26 So if Satan rebels against himself and
is divided, he cannot last. That will be
the end of him.
27 "No one can go into a strong man’s
house and steal his property. First heMARK 3
17
must e up the strong man. Then he can
go through the strong man’s house and
steal his property.
28 "I can guarantee this truth: People
will be forgiven for any sin or curse.
29 But whoever curses the Holy Spirit
will never be forgiven. He is guilty of an
everlas ng sin."
30 Jesus said this because the scribes
had said that he had an evil spirit.
31 Then his mother and his brothers
arrived. They stood outside and sent
someone to ask him to come out.
32 The crowd si ng around Jesus told
him, "Your mother and your brothers are
outside looking for you."
33 He replied to them, "Who is my
mother, and who are my brothers?"
34 Then looking at those who sat in a
circle around him, he said, "Look, here
are my mother and my brothers.MARK 3 – 4
18
35 Whoever does what God wants is my
brother and sister and mother."
1 Jesus began to teach again by the
Sea of Galilee. A very large crowd
gathered around him, so he got into a
boat and sat in it. The boat was in the
water while the en re crowd lined the
shore.
2 He used stories as illustra ons to
teach them many things. While he was
teaching them, he said,
3 "Listen! A farmer went to plant seed.
4 Some seeds were planted along the
road, and birds came and devoured
them.
5 Other seeds were planted on rocky
ground, where there wasn’t much soil.
The plants sprouted quickly because the
soil wasn’t deep.
6 When the sun came up, they were
scorched. They didn’t have any roots, so
they withered.
4MARK 4
19
7 Other seeds were planted among
thornbushes. The thornbushes grew
up and choked them, and they didn’t
produce anything.
8 But other seeds were planted on good
ground, sprouted, and produced thirty,
sixty, or one hundred mes as much as
was planted."
9 He added, "Let the person who has
ears listen!"
10 When he was alone with his followers
and the twelve apostles, they asked him
about the stories.
11 Jesus replied to them, "The mystery
about the kingdom of God has been
given directly to you. To those on the
outside, it is given in stories:
12 ’They see clearly but don’t perceive.
They hear clearly but don’t understand.
They never return to me and are never
forgiven.’"MARK 4
20
13 Jesus asked them, "Don’t you
understand this story? How, then, will
you understand any of the stories I use
as illustra ons?
14 "The farmer plants the word.
15 Some people are like seeds that were
planted along the road. Whenever they
hear the word, Satan comes at once and
takes away the word that was planted in
them.
16 Other people are like seeds that were
planted on rocky ground. Whenever
they hear the word, they accept it at
once with joy.
17 But they don’t develop any roots.
They last for a short me. When suﬀering
or persecu on comes along because of
the word, they immediately fall from
faith.
18 Other people are like seeds planted
among thornbushes. They hear the
word,MARK 4
19 but the worries of life, the decei
21
ul
pleasures of riches, and the desires for
other things take over. They choke the
word so that it can’t produce anything.
20 Others are like seeds planted on good
ground. They hear the word, accept it,
and produce crops––thirty, sixty, or one
hundred mes as much as was planted."
21 Jesus said to them, "Does anyone
bring a lamp into a room to put it under
a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a
lamp stand?
22 There is nothing hidden that will not
be revealed. There is nothing kept secret
that will not come to light.
23 Let the person who has ears listen!"
24 He went on to say, "Pay a en on to
what you’re listening to! Knowledge will
be measured out to you by the measure
of a en on you give. This is the way
knowledge increases.MARK 4
22
25 Those who understand these
mysteries will be given more knowledge.
However, some people don’t understand
these mysteries. Even what they
understand will be taken away from
them."
26 Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is
like a man who sca ers seeds on the
ground.
27 He sleeps at night and is awake
during the day. The seeds sprout and
grow, although the man doesn’t know
how.
28 The ground produces grain by itself.
First the green blade appears, then the
head, then the head full of grain.
29 As soon as the grain is ready, he cuts
it with a sickle, because harvest me has
come."
30 Jesus asked, "How can we show what
the kingdom of God is like? To what can
we compare it?MARK 4
23
31 It’s like a mustard seed planted in the
ground. The mustard seed is one of the
smallest seeds on earth.
32 However, when planted, it comes up
and becomes taller than all the garden
plants. It grows such large branches that
birds can nest in its shade."
33 Jesus spoke God’s word to them
using many illustra ons like these. In this
way people could understand what he
taught.
34 He did not speak to them without
using an illustra on. But when he was
alone with his disciples, he explained
everything to them.
35 That evening, Jesus said to his
disciples, "Let’s cross to the other side."
36 Leaving the crowd, they took Jesus
along in a boat just as he was. Other
boats were with him.MARK 4 – 5
24
37 A violent windstorm came up. The
waves were breaking into the boat so
that it was quickly ﬁlling up.
38 But he was sleeping on a cushion in
the back of the boat. So they woke him
up and said to him, "Teacher, don’t you
care that we’re going to die?"
39 Then he got up, ordered the wind
to stop, and said to the sea, "Be s ll,
absolutely s ll!" The wind stopped
blowing, and the sea became very calm.
40 He asked them, "Why are you such
cowards? Don’t you have any faith yet?"
41 They were overcome with fear and
asked each other, "Who is this man?
Even the wind and the sea obey him!"
1 They arrived in the territory of the
Gerasenes on the other side of the
Sea of Galilee.
2 As Jesus stepped out of the boat, a
man came out of the tombs and met
5MARK 5
25
him. The man was controlled by an evil
spirit
3 and lived among the tombs. No one
could restrain him any longer, not even
with a chain.
4 He had o en been chained hand and
foot. However, he snapped the chains
oﬀ his hands and broke the chains from
his feet. No one could control him.
5 Night and day he was among the
tombs and on the mountainsides
screaming and cu ng himself with
stones.
6 The man saw Jesus at a distance. So
he ran to Jesus, bowed down in front of
him,
7 and shouted, "Why are you bothering
me now, Jesus, Son of the Most High
God? Swear to God that you won’t
torture me."
8 He shouted this because Jesus said,
"You evil spirit, come out of the man."MARK 5
26
9 Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?" He told Jesus, "My name is
Legion [Six Thousand], because there
are many of us."
10 He begged Jesus not to send them
out of the territory.
11 A large herd of pigs was feeding on a
mountainside nearby.
12 The demons begged him, "Send us
into the pigs! Let us enter them!"
13 Jesus let them do this. The evil spirits
came out of the man and went into the
pigs. The herd of about two thousand
pigs rushed down the cliﬀ into the sea
and drowned.
14 Those who took care of the pigs ran
away. In the city and countryside they
reported everything that had happened.
So the people came to see what had
happened.
15 They came to Jesus and saw the
man who had been possessed by theMARK 5
27
legion of demons. The man was si ng
there dressed and in his right mind. The
people were frightened.
16 Those who saw this told what had
happened to the demon–possessed man
and the pigs.
17 Then the people began to beg Jesus
to leave their territory.
18 As Jesus stepped into the boat, the
man who had been demon–possessed
begged him, "Let me stay with you."
19 But Jesus would not allow it. Instead,
he told the man, "Go home to your
family, and tell them how much the Lord
has done for you and how merciful he
has been to you."
20 So the man le . He began to tell how
much Jesus had done for him in the Ten
Ci es. Everyone was amazed.
21 Jesus again crossed to the other
side of the Sea of Galilee in a boat. AMARK 5
28
large crowd gathered around him by the
seashore.
22 A synagogue leader named Jairus
also arrived. When he saw Jesus, he
quickly bowed down in front of him.
23 He begged Jesus, "My li le daughter
is dying. Come, lay your hands on her so
that she may get well and live."
24 Jesus went with the man. A huge
crowd followed Jesus and pressed him
on every side.
25 In the crowd was a woman who had
been suﬀering from chronic bleeding for
twelve years.
26 Although she had been under the
care of many doctors and had spent all
her money, she had not been helped at
all. Actually, she had become worse.
27 Since she had heard about Jesus,
she came from behind in the crowd and
touched his clothes.MARK 5
29
28 She said, "If I can just touch his
clothes, I’ll get well."
29 Her bleeding stopped immediately.
She felt cured from her illness.
30 At that moment Jesus felt power had
gone out of him. He turned around in
the crowd and asked, "Who touched my
clothes?"
31 His disciples said to him, "How can
you ask, ‘Who touched me,’ when you
see the crowd pressing you on all sides?"
32 But he kept looking around to see
the woman who had done this.
33 The woman trembled with fear. She
knew what had happened to her. So she
quickly bowed in front of him and told
him the whole truth.
34 Jesus told her, "Daughter, your faith
has made you well. Go in peace! Be
cured from your illness."
35 While Jesus was s ll speaking to her,
some people came from the synagogueMARK 5
30
leader’s home. They told the synagogue
leader, "Your daughter has died. Why
bother the teacher anymore?"
36 When Jesus overheard what they
said, he told the synagogue leader,
"Don’t be afraid! Just believe."
37 Jesus allowed no one to go with him
except Peter and the two brothers James
and John.
38 When they came to the home of
the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a noisy
crowd there. People were crying and
sobbing loudly.
39 When he came into the house, he
asked them, "Why are you making so
much noise and crying? The child isn’t
dead. She’s just sleeping."
40 They laughed at him. So he made
all of them go outside. Then he took
the child’s father, mother, and his three
disciples and went to the child.MARK 5 – 6
31
41 Jesus took the child’s hand and said
to her, "Talitha, koum!" which means,
"Li le girl, I’m telling you to get up!"
42 The girl got up at once and started to
walk. (She was twelve years old.) They
were astonished.
43 Jesus ordered them not to let anyone
know about this. He also told them to
give the li le girl something to eat.
1 Jesus le that place and went to
his hometown. His disciples followed
him.
2 When the day of worship came, he
began to teach in the synagogue. He
amazed many who heard him. They
asked, "Where did this man get these
ideas? Who gave him this kind of wisdom
and the ability to do such great miracles?
3 Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of
Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph,
Judas, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here
with us?" So they took oﬀense at him.
6MARK 6
32
4 But Jesus told them, "The only
place a prophet isn’t honored is in his
hometown, among his rela ves, and in
his own house."
5 He couldn’t work any miracles there
except to lay his hands on a few sick
people and cure them.
6 Their unbelief amazed him. Then
Jesus went around to the villages and
taught.
7 He called the twelve apostles, sent
them out two by two, and gave them
authority over evil spirits.
8 He instructed them to take nothing
along on the trip except a walking
s ck. They were not to take any food, a
traveling bag, or money in their pockets.
9 They could wear sandals but could not
take along a change of clothes.
10 He told them, "Whenever you go into
a home, stay there un l you’re ready to
leave that place.MARK 6
33
11 Wherever people don’t welcome you
or listen to you, leave and shake the dust
from your feet as a warning to them."
12 So the apostles went and told people
that they should turn to God and change
the way they think and act.
13 They also forced many demons out
of people and poured oil on many who
were sick to cure them.
14 King Herod heard about Jesus,
because Jesus’ name had become
well–known. Some people were saying,
"John the Bap zer has come back to life.
That’s why he has the power to perform
these miracles."
15 Others said, "He is Elijah." S ll others
said, "He is a prophet like one of the
other prophets."
16 But when Herod heard about it, he
said, "I had John’s head cut oﬀ, and he
has come back to life!"MARK 6
34
17 Herod had sent men who had
arrested John, ed him up, and put him
in prison. Herod did that for Herodias,
whom he had married. (She used to be
his brother Philip’s wife.)
18 John had been telling Herod, "It’s
not right for you to be married to your
brother’s wife."
19 So Herodias held a grudge against
John and wanted to kill him. But she
wasn’t allowed to do it
20 because Herod was afraid of John.
Herod knew that John was a fair and
holy man, so he protected him. When he
listened to John, he would become very
disturbed, and yet he liked to listen to
him.
21 An opportunity ﬁnally came on
Herod’s birthday. Herod gave a dinner
for his top oﬃcials, army oﬃcers, and
the most important people of Galilee.MARK 6
35
22 His daughter, that is, Herodias’
daughter, came in and danced. Herod
and his guests were delighted with
her. The king told the girl, "Ask me for
anything you want, and I’ll give it to
you."
23 He swore an oath to her: "I’ll give you
anything you ask for, up to half of my
kingdom."
24 So she went out and asked her
mother, "What should I ask for?" Her
mother said, "Ask for the head of John
the Bap zer."
25 So the girl hurried back to the king
with her request. She said, "I want you
to give me the head of John the Bap zer
on a pla er at once."
26 The king deeply regre ed his
promise. But because of his oath and his
guests, he didn’t want to refuse her.MARK 6
36
27 Immediately, the king sent a guard
and ordered him to bring John’s head.
The guard cut oﬀ John’s head in prison.
28 Then he brought the head on a
pla er and gave it to the girl, and the girl
gave it to her mother.
29 When John’s disciples heard about
this, they came for his body and laid it in
a tomb.
30 The apostles gathered around Jesus.
They reported to him everything they
had done and taught.
31 So he said to them, "Let’s go to a
place where we can be alone to rest for
a while." Many people were coming and
going, and Jesus and the apostles didn’t
even have a chance to eat.
32 So they went away in a boat to a
place where they could be alone.
33 But many people saw them leave and
recognized them. The people ran from
all the ci es and arrived ahead of them.MARK 6
37
34 When Jesus got out of the boat, he
saw a large crowd and felt sorry for
them. They were like sheep without
a shepherd. So he spent a lot of me
teaching them.
35 When it was late, his disciples came
to him. They said, "No one lives around
here, and it’s already late.
36 Send the people to the closest
farms and villages to buy themselves
something to eat."
37 Jesus replied, "You give them
something to eat." They said to him,
"Should we go and spend about a year’s
wages on bread to feed them?"
38 He said to them, "How many loaves
do you have? Go and see." When they
found out, they told him, "Five loaves of
bread and two ﬁsh."
39 Then he ordered all of them to sit
down in groups on the green grass.MARK 6
38
40 They sat down in groups of hundreds
and ﬁ ies.
41 A er he took the ﬁve loaves and
the two ﬁsh, he looked up to heaven
and blessed the food. He broke the
loaves apart and kept giving them to the
disciples to give to the people. He also
gave pieces of the two ﬁsh to everyone.
42 All of them ate as much as they
wanted.
43 When they picked up the le over
pieces, they ﬁlled twelve baskets with
bread and ﬁsh.
44 There were 5,000 men who had
eaten the bread.
45 Jesus quickly made his disciples get
into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead
of him while he sent the people away.
46 A er saying goodbye to them, he
went up a mountain to pray.MARK 6
39
47 When evening came, the boat was in
the middle of the sea, and he was alone
on the land.
48 Jesus saw that they were in a lot of
trouble as they rowed, because they
were going against the wind. Between
three and six o’clock in the morning, he
came to them. He was walking on the
sea. He wanted to pass by them.
49 When they saw him walking on the
sea, they thought, "It’s a ghost!" and
they began to scream.
50 All of them saw him and were
terriﬁed. Immediately, he said, "Calm
down! It’s me. Don’t be afraid!"
51 He got into the boat with them, and
the wind stopped blowing. The disciples
were astounded.
52 (They didn’t understand what had
happened with the loaves of bread.
Instead, their minds were closed.)MARK 6 – 7
40
53 They crossed the sea, came to shore
at Gennesaret, and anchored there.
54 As soon as they stepped out of the
boat, the people recognized Jesus.
55 They ran all over the countryside and
began to carry the sick on cots to any
place where they heard he was.
56 Whenever he would go into villages,
ci es, or farms, people would put their
sick in the marketplaces. They begged
him to let them touch the edge of his
clothes. Everyone who touched his
clothes was made well.
1 The Pharisees and some scribes
who had come from Jerusalem
gathered around Jesus.
2 They saw that some of his disciples
were unclean because they ate without
washing their hands.
3 (The Pharisees, like all other Jewish
people, don’t eat unless they have
7MARK 7
41
properly washed their hands. They
follow the tradi ons of their ancestors.
4 When they come from the
marketplace, they don’t eat unless
they have washed ﬁrst. They have been
taught to follow many other rules. For
example, they must also wash their cups,
jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)
5 The Pharisees and the scribes asked
Jesus, "Why don’t your disciples follow
the tradi ons taught by our ancestors?
They are unclean because they don’t
wash their hands before they eat!"
6 Jesus told them, "Isaiah was right
when he prophesied about you
hypocrites in Scripture: ‘These people
honor me with their lips, but their hearts
are far from me.
7 Their worship of me is pointless,
because their teachings are rules made
by humans.’MARK 7
42
8 "You abandon the commandments of
God to follow human tradi ons."
9 He added, "You have no trouble
rejec ng the commandments of God in
order to keep your own tradi ons!
10 For example, Moses said, ‘Honor your
father and your mother’ and ‘Whoever
curses father or mother must be put to
death.’
11 But you say, ‘If a person tells his
father or mother that whatever he might
have used to help them is corban (that
is, an oﬀering to God),
12 he no longer has to do anything for
his father or mother.’
13 Because of your tradi ons you have
destroyed the authority of God’s word.
And you do many other things like that."
14 Then he called the crowd again and
said to them, "Listen to me, all of you,
and try to understand!MARK 7
43
15 Nothing that goes into a person from
the outside can make him unclean. It’s
what comes out of a person that makes
him unclean.
16 Let the person who has ears listen!"
17 When he had le the people and
gone home, his disciples asked him
about this illustra on.
18 Jesus said to them, "Don’t you
understand? Don’t you know that
whatever goes into a person from the
outside can’t make him unclean?
19 It doesn’t go into his thoughts but
into his stomach and then into a toilet."
(By saying this, Jesus declared all foods
acceptable.)
20 He con nued, "It’s what comes out
of a person that makes him unclean.
21 Evil thoughts, sexual sins, stealing,
murder,
22 adultery, greed, wickedness,
chea ng, shameless lust, envy, cursing,MARK 7
44
arrogance, and foolishness come from
within a person.
23 All these evils come from within and
make a person unclean."
24 Jesus le that place and went to the
territory of Tyre. He didn’t want anyone
to know that he was staying in a house
there. However, it couldn’t be kept a
secret.
25 A woman whose li le daughter had
an evil spirit heard about Jesus. She
went to him and bowed down.
26 The woman happened to be Greek,
born in Phoenicia in Syria. She asked him
to force the demon out of her daughter.
27 Jesus said to her, "First, let the
children eat all they want. It’s not right
to take the children’s food and throw it
to the dogs."
28 She answered him, "Lord, even the
dogs under the table eat some of the
children’s scraps."MARK 7
45
29 Jesus said to her, "Because you have
said this, go! The demon has le your
daughter."
30 The woman went home and found
the li le child lying on her bed, and the
demon was gone.
31 Jesus then le the neighborhood of
Tyre. He went through Sidon and the
territory of the Ten Ci es to the Sea of
Galilee.
32 Some people brought to him a man
who was deaf and who also had a speech
defect. They begged Jesus to lay his hand
on him.
33 Jesus took him away from the crowd
to be alone with him. He put his ﬁngers
into the man’s ears, and a er spi ng,
he touched the man’s tongue.
34 Then he looked up to heaven, sighed,
and said to the man, "Ephphatha!"
which means, "Be opened!"MARK 7 – 8
46
35 At once the man could hear and talk
normally.
36 Jesus ordered the people not to tell
anyone. But the more he ordered them,
the more they spread the news.
37 Jesus completely amazed the people.
They said, "He has done everything well.
He makes the deaf hear and the mute
talk."
1 About that me there was once
again a large crowd with nothing to
eat. Jesus called his disciples and said to
them,
2 "I feel sorry for the people. They have
been with me three days now and have
nothing to eat.
3 If I send them home before they’ve
eaten, they will become exhausted on
the road. Some of them have come a
long distance."
8MARK 8
47
4 His disciples asked him, "Where could
anyone get enough bread to feed these
people in this place where no one lives?"
5 Jesus asked them, "How many loaves
of bread do you have?" They answered,
"Seven."
6 He ordered the crowd to sit down on
the ground. He took the seven loaves
and gave thanks to God. Then he broke
the bread and gave it to his disciples to
serve to the people.
7 They also had a few small ﬁsh. He
blessed them and said that the ﬁsh
should also be served to the people.
8 The people ate as much as they
wanted. The disciples picked up the
le over pieces and ﬁlled seven large
baskets.
9 About four thousand people were
there. Then he sent the people on their
way.MARK 8
10 A
48
er that, Jesus and his disciples got
into a boat and went into the region of
Dalmanutha.
11 The Pharisees went to Jesus and
began to argue with him. They tested
him by demanding that he perform a
miraculous sign from heaven.
12 With a deep sigh he asked, "Why
do these people demand a sign? I can
guarantee this truth: If these people are
given a sign, it will be far diﬀerent than
what they want!"
13 Then he le them there. He got into
a boat again and crossed to the other
side of the Sea of Galilee.
14 The disciples had forgo en to take
any bread along and had only one loaf
with them in the boat.
15 Jesus warned them, "Be careful!
Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees
and the yeast of Herod!"MARK 8
49
16 They had been discussing with one
another that they didn’t have any bread.
17 Jesus knew what they were saying
and asked them, "Why are you discussing
the fact that you don’t have any bread?
Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you
catch on? Are your minds closed?
18 Are you blind and deaf? Don’t you
remember?
19 When I broke the ﬁve loaves for the
ﬁve thousand, how many baskets did
you ﬁll with le over pieces?" They told
him, "Twelve."
20 "When I broke the seven loaves for
the four thousand, how many large
baskets did you ﬁll with le over pieces?"
They answered him, "Seven."
21 He asked them, "Don’t you catch on
yet?"
22 As they came to Bethsaida, some
people brought a blind man to Jesus.
They begged Jesus to touch him.MARK 8
50
23 Jesus took the blind man’s hand and
led him out of the village. He spit into
the man’s eyes and placed his hands
on him. Jesus asked him, "Can you see
anything?"
24 The man looked up and said, "I see
people. They look like trees walking
around."
25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the
man’s eyes a second me, and the man
saw clearly. His sight was normal again.
He could see everything clearly even at a
distance.
26 Jesus told him when he sent him
home, "Don’t go into the village."
27 Then Jesus and his disciples went to
the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On
the way he asked his disciples, "Who do
people say I am?"
28 They answered him, "Some say you
are John the Bap zer, others Elijah, s ll
others one of the prophets."MARK 8
51
29 He asked them, "But who do you say
I am?" Peter answered him, "You are the
Messiah!"
30 He ordered them not to tell anyone
about him.
31 Then he began to teach them that
the Son of Man would have to suﬀer a
lot. He taught them that he would be
rejected by the leaders, the chief priests,
and the scribes. He would be killed, but
a er three days he would come back to
life.
32 He told them very clearly what
he meant. Peter took him aside and
objected to this.
33 Jesus turned, looked at his disciples,
and objected to what Peter said. Jesus
said, "Get out of my way, Satan! You
aren’t thinking the way God thinks but
the way humans think."
34 Then Jesus called the crowd to
himself along with his disciples. He saidMARK 8 – 9
52
to them, "Those who want to follow me
must say no to the things they want, pick
up their crosses, and follow me.
35 Those who want to save their lives
will lose them. But those who lose their
lives for me and for the Good News will
save them.
36 What good does it do for people to
win the whole world yet lose their lives?
37 Or what should a person give in
exchange for life?
38 If people are ashamed of me and
what I say in this unfaithful and sinful
genera on, the Son of Man will be
ashamed of those people when he
comes with the holy angels in his
Father’s glory."
1 He said to them, "I can guarantee
this truth: Some people who are
standing here will not die un l they see
the kingdom of God arrive with power."
9MARK 9
2A
53
er six days Jesus took only Peter,
James, and John and led them up a high
mountain where they could be alone.
Jesus’ appearance changed in front of
them.
3 His clothes became dazzling white,
whiter than anyone on earth could
bleach them.
4 Then Elijah and Moses appeared to
them and were talking with Jesus.
5 Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it’s good
that we’re here. Let’s put up three
tents––one for you, one for Moses, and
one for Elijah."
6 (Peter didn’t know how to respond.
He and the others were terriﬁed.)
7 Then a cloud overshadowed them. A
voice came out of the cloud and said,
"This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to
him!"
8 Suddenly, as they looked around, they
saw no one with them but Jesus.MARK 9
54
9 On their way down the mountain,
Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone
what they had seen. They were to wait
un l the Son of Man had come back to
life.
10 They kept in mind what he said but
argued among themselves what he
meant by "come back to life."
11 So they asked him, "Don’t the scribes
say that Elijah must come ﬁrst?"
12 Jesus said to them, "Elijah is coming
ﬁrst and will put everything in order
again. But in what sense was it wri en
that the Son of Man must suﬀer a lot
and be treated shamefully?
13 Indeed, I can guarantee that Elijah
has come. Yet, people treated him as
they pleased, as Scripture says about
him."
14 When they came to the other
disciples, they saw a large crowd aroundMARK 9
55
them. Some scribes were arguing with
them.
15 All the people were very surprised to
see Jesus and ran to welcome him.
16 Jesus asked the scribes, "What are
you arguing about with them?"
17 A man in the crowd answered,
"Teacher, I brought you my son. He is
possessed by a spirit that won’t let him
talk.
18 Whenever the spirit brings on a
seizure, it throws him to the ground.
Then he foams at the mouth, grinds his
teeth, and becomes exhausted. I asked
your disciples to force the spirit out, but
they didn’t have the power to do it."
19 Jesus said to them, "You unbelieving
genera on! How long must I be with
you? How long must I put up with you?
Bring him to me!"
20 They brought the boy to him. As soon
as the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boyMARK 9
56
into convulsions. He fell on the ground,
rolled around, and foamed at the mouth.
21 Jesus asked his father, "How long has
he been like this?" The father replied,
"He has been this way since he was a
child.
22 The demon has o en thrown him
into ﬁre or into water to destroy him. If
it’s possible for you, put yourself in our
place, and help us!"
23 Jesus said to him, "As far as
possibili es go, everything is possible for
the person who believes."
24 The child’s father cried out at once, "I
believe! Help my lack of faith."
25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was
running to the scene, he gave an order
to the evil spirit. He said, "You spirit that
won’t let him talk, I command you to
come out of him and never enter him
again."MARK 9
57
26 The evil spirit screamed, shook the
child violently, and came out. The boy
looked as if he were dead, and everyone
said, "He’s dead!"
27 Jesus took his hand and helped him
to stand up.
28 When Jesus went into a house, his
disciples asked him privately, "Why
couldn’t we force the spirit out of the
boy?"
29 He told them, "This kind of spirit can
be forced out only by prayer."
30 They le that place and were passing
through Galilee. Jesus did not want
anyone to know where he was
31 because he was teaching his disciples.
He taught them, "The Son of Man will
be betrayed and handed over to people.
They will kill him, but on the third day he
will come back to life."
32 The disciples didn’t understand what
he meant and were afraid to ask him.MARK 9
58
33 Then they came to Capernaum.
While Jesus was at home, he asked the
disciples, "What were you arguing about
on the road?"
34 They were silent. On the road they
had argued about who was the greatest.
35 He sat down and called the twelve
apostles. He told them, "Whoever wants
to be the most important person must
take the last place and be a servant to
everyone else."
36 Then he took a li le child and had
him stand among them. He put his arms
around the child and said to them,
37 "Whoever welcomes a child like this
in my name welcomes me. Whoever
welcomes me welcomes not me but the
one who sent me."
38 John said to Jesus, "Teacher, we saw
someone forcing demons out of a person
by using the power and authority of yourMARK 9
59
name. We tried to stop him because he
was not one of us."
39 Jesus said, "Don’t stop him! No one
who works a miracle in my name can
turn around and speak evil of me.
40 Whoever isn’t against us is for us.
41 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever
gives you a cup of water to drink because
you belong to Christ will certainly not
lose his reward."
42 "These li le ones believe in me. It
would be best for the person who causes
one of them to lose faith to be thrown
into the sea with a large stone hung
around his neck.
43 "So if your hand causes you to lose
your faith, cut it oﬀ! It is be er for you
to enter life disabled than to have two
hands and go to hell, to the ﬁre that
cannot be put out.
44 (OMITTED TEXT)MARK 9 – 10
60
45 If your foot causes you to lose your
faith, cut it oﬀ! It is be er for you to
enter life lame than to have two feet and
be thrown into hell.
46 (OMITTED TEXT)
47 If your eye causes you to lose your
faith, tear it out! It is be er for you to
enter the kingdom of God with one eye
than to have two eyes and be thrown
into hell.
48 In hell worms that eat the body never
die, and the ﬁre is never put out.
49 Everyone will be salted with ﬁre.
50 Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste,
how will you restore its ﬂavor? Have salt
within you, and live in peace with one
another."
1 Jesus le there and went into
the territory of Judea along the
other side of the Jordan River. Crowds
gathered around him again, and he
taught them as he usually did.
10MARK 10
61
2 Some Pharisees came to test him.
They asked, "Can a husband divorce his
wife?"
3 Jesus answered them, "What
command did Moses give you?"
4 They said, "Moses allowed a man to
give his wife a wri en no ce to divorce
her."
5 Jesus said to them, "He wrote this
command for you because you’re
heartless.
6 But God made them male and female
in the beginning, at crea on.
7 That’s why a man will leave his father
and mother and will remain united with
his wife,
8 and the two will be one. So they are
no longer two but one.
9 Therefore, don’t let anyone separate
what God has joined together."
10 When they were in a house, the
disciples asked him about this.MARK 10
62
11 He answered them, "Whoever
divorces his wife and marries another
woman is commi ng adultery.
12 If a wife divorces her husband and
marries another man, she is commi ng
adultery."
13 Some people brought li le children
to Jesus to have him hold them. But the
disciples told the people not to do that.
14 When Jesus saw this, he became
irritated. He told them, "Don’t stop the
children from coming to me. Children
like these are part of the kingdom of
God.
15 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever
doesn’t receive the kingdom of God as a
li le child receives it will never enter it."
16 Jesus put his arms around the
children and blessed them by placing his
hands on them.
17 As Jesus was coming out to the road,
a man came running to him and kneltMARK 10
63
in front of him. He asked Jesus, "Good
Teacher, what should I do to inherit
eternal life?"
18 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call
me good? No one is good except God
alone.
19 You know the commandments: Never
murder. Never commit adultery. Never
steal. Never give false tes mony. Never
cheat. Honor your father and mother."
20 The man replied, "Teacher, I’ve
obeyed all these commandments since I
was a boy."
21 Jesus looked at him and loved him.
He told him, "You’re s ll missing one
thing. Sell everything you have. Give the
money to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then follow me!"
22 When the man heard that, he looked
unhappy and went away sad, because
he owned a lot of property.MARK 10
64
23 Jesus looked around and said to his
disciples, "How hard it will be for rich
people to enter the kingdom of God!"
24 The disciples were stunned by his
words. But Jesus said to them again,
"Children, how hard it is to enter the
kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich person
to enter the kingdom of God."
26 This amazed his disciples more than
ever. They asked each other, "Who, then,
can be saved?"
27 Jesus looked at them and said,
"It’s impossible for people to save
themselves, but it’s not impossible for
God to save them. Everything is possible
for God."
28 Then Peter spoke up, "We’ve given
up everything to follow you."
29 Jesus said, "I can guarantee this truth:
Anyone who gave up his home, brothers,MARK 10
65
sisters, mother, father, children, or ﬁelds
because of me and the Good News
30 will certainly receive a hundred
mes as much here in this life. They
will certainly receive homes, brothers,
sisters, mothers, children and ﬁelds,
along with persecu ons. But in the world
to come they will receive eternal life.
31 But many who are ﬁrst will be last,
and the last will be ﬁrst."
32 Jesus and his disciples were on their
way to Jerusalem. Jesus was walking
ahead of them. His disciples were
shocked that he was going to Jerusalem.
The others who followed were afraid.
Once again he took the twelve apostles
aside. He began to tell them what was
going to happen to him.
33 "We’re going to Jerusalem. There
the Son of Man will be betrayed to the
chief priests and the scribes. They willMARK 10
66
condemn him to death and hand him
over to foreigners.
34 They will make fun of him, spit on
him, whip him, and kill him. But a er
three days he will come back to life."
35 James and John, sons of Zebedee,
went to Jesus. They said to him, "Teacher,
we want you to do us a favor."
36 "What do you want me to do for
you?" he asked them.
37 They said to him, "Let one of us sit at
your right and the other at your le in
your glory."
38 Jesus said, "You don’t realize what
you’re asking. Can you drink the cup
that I’m going to drink? Can you be
bap zed with the bap sm that I’m going
to receive?"
39 "We can," they told him. Jesus told
them, "You will drink the cup that I’m
going to drink. You will be bap zed with
the bap sm that I’m going to receive.MARK 10
67
40 But I don’t have the authority to
grant you a seat at my right or le . Those
posi ons have already been prepared
for certain people."
41 When the other ten apostles heard
about it, they were irritated with James
and John.
42 Jesus called the apostles and said,
"You know that the acknowledged rulers
of na ons have absolute power over
people and their oﬃcials have absolute
authority over people.
43 But that’s not the way it’s going to be
among you. Whoever wants to become
great among you will be your servant.
44 Whoever wants to be most important
among you will be a slave for everyone.
45 It’s the same way with the Son of
Man. He didn’t come so that others
could serve him. He came to serve and
to give his life as a ransom for many
people."MARK 10
68
46 Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus,
his disciples, and many people were
leaving Jericho, a blind beggar named
Bar maeus, son of Timaeus, was si ng
by the road.
47 When he heard that Jesus from
Nazareth was passing by, he began to
shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy
on me!"
48 The people told him to be quiet. But
he shouted even louder, "Son of David,
have mercy on me!"
49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him!"
They called the blind man and told him,
"Cheer up! Get up! He’s calling you."
50 The blind man threw oﬀ his coat,
jumped up, and went to Jesus.
51 Jesus asked him, "What do you want
me to do for you?" The blind man said,
"Teacher, I want to see again."
52 Jesus told him, "Go, your faith has
made you well." At once he could seeMARK 11
69
again, and he followed Jesus on the
road.
1 When they came near
Jerusalem, to Bethphage and
Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus
sent two of his disciples ahead of him.
2 He said to them, "Go into the village
ahead of you. As you enter it, you will
ﬁnd a young donkey ed there. No one
has ever sat on it. Un e it, and bring it.
3 If anyone asks you what you are doing,
say that the Lord needs it. That person
will send it here at once."
4 The disciples found the young donkey
in the street. It was ed to the door of a
house. As they were untying it,
5 some men standing there asked them,
"Why are you untying that donkey?"
6 The disciples answered them as Jesus
had told them. So the men let them go.
7 They brought the donkey to Jesus, put
their coats on it, and he sat on it.
11MARK 11
70
8 Many spread their coats on the road.
Others cut leafy branches in the ﬁelds
and spread them on the road.
9 Those who went ahead and those who
followed him were shou ng, "Hosanna!
Blessed is the one who comes in the
name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is our ancestor David’s
kingdom that is coming! Hosanna in the
highest heaven!"
11 Jesus came into Jerusalem and went
into the temple courtyard, where he
looked around at everything. Since it
was already late, he went out with the
twelve apostles to Bethany.
12 The next day, when they le Bethany,
Jesus became hungry.
13 In the distance he saw a ﬁg tree
with leaves. He went to see if he could
ﬁnd any ﬁgs on it. When he came to it,
he found nothing but leaves because it
wasn’t the season for ﬁgs.MARK 11
71
14 Then he said to the tree, "No one
will ever eat fruit from you again!" His
disciples heard this.
15 When they came to Jerusalem, Jesus
went into the temple courtyard and
began to throw out those who were
buying and selling there. He overturned
the moneychangers’ tables and the
chairs of those who sold pigeons.
16 He would not let anyone carry
anything across the temple courtyard.
17 Then he taught them by saying,
"Scripture says, ‘My house will be called
a house of prayer for all na ons,’ but you
have turned it into a gathering place for
thieves."
18 When the chief priests and scribes
heard him, they looked for a way to kill
him. They were afraid of him because he
amazed all the crowds with his teaching.
19 (Every evening Jesus and his disciples
would leave the city.)MARK 11
72
20 While Jesus and his disciples were
walking early in the morning, they saw
that the ﬁg tree had dried up.
21 Peter remembered what Jesus had
said, so he said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look!
The ﬁg tree you cursed has dried up."
22 Jesus said to them, "Have faith in
God!
23 I can guarantee this truth: This is
what will be done for someone who
doesn’t doubt but believes what he says
will happen: He can say to this mountain,
‘Be uprooted and thrown into the sea,’
and it will be done for him.
24 That’s why I tell you to have faith that
you have already received whatever you
pray for, and it will be yours.
25 Whenever you pray, forgive anything
you have against anyone. Then your
Father in heaven will forgive your
failures."
26 (OMITTED TEXT)MARK 11
73
27 Jesus and his disciples returned to
Jerusalem. As he was walking in the
temple courtyard, the chief priests, the
scribes, and the leaders came to him.
28 They asked him, "What gives you the
right to do these things? Who told you
that you could do this?"
29 Jesus said to them, "I’ll ask you a
ques on. Answer me, and then I’ll tell
you why I have the right to do these
things.
30 Did John’s right to bap ze come from
heaven or from humans? Answer me!"
31 They discussed this among
themselves. They said, "If we say, ‘from
heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t
you believe him?’
32 But if we say, ‘from humans,’ then
what will happen?" They were afraid of
the people. All the people thought of
John as a true prophet.MARK 11 – 12
74
33 So they answered Jesus, "We don’t
know." Jesus told them, "Then I won’t
tell you why I have the right to do these
things."
1 Then, using this illustra on,
Jesus spoke to them. He said, "A
man planted a vineyard. He put a wall
around it, made a vat for the winepress,
and built a watchtower. Then he leased it
to vineyard workers and went on a trip.
2 "At the right me he sent a servant to
the workers to collect from them a share
of the grapes from the vineyard.
3 The workers took the servant, beat
him, and sent him back with nothing.
4 So the man sent another servant to
them. They hit the servant on the head
and treated him shamefully.
5 The man sent another, and they killed
that servant. Then he sent many other
servants. Some of these they beat, and
others they killed.
12MARK 12
75
6 "He had one more person to send.
That person was his son, whom he loved.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He
thought, ‘They will respect my son.’
7 "But those workers said to one
another, ‘This is the heir. Let’s kill him,
and the inheritance will be ours.’
8 So they took him, killed him, and
threw him out of the vineyard.
9 "What will the owner of the vineyard
do? He will come and destroy the
workers and give the vineyard to others.
10 Have you never read the Scripture
passage: ‘The stone that the builders
rejected has become the cornerstone.
11 The Lord has done this, and it is
amazing for us to see’?"
12 They wanted to arrest him but were
afraid of the crowd. They knew that he
had directed this illustra on at them. So
they le him alone and went away.MARK 12
76
13 The leaders sent some of the
Pharisees and some of Herod’s followers
to Jesus. They wanted to trap him into
saying the wrong thing.
14 When they came to him, they
said, "Teacher, we know that you tell
the truth. You don’t favor individuals
because of who they are. Rather, you
teach the way of God truthfully. Is it
right to pay taxes to the emperor or not?
Should we pay taxes or not?"
15 Jesus recognized their hypocrisy, so
he asked them, "Why do you test me?
Bring me a coin so that I can look at it."
16 They brought a coin. He said to them,
"Whose face and name is this?" They
told him, "The emperor’s."
17 Jesus said to them, "Give the
emperor what belongs to the emperor,
and give God what belongs to God."
They were surprised at his reply.MARK 12
77
18 Some Sadducees, who say that
people will never come back to life,
came to Jesus. They asked him,
19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, ‘If a
man dies and leaves a wife but no child,
his brother should marry his widow and
have children for his brother.’
20 There were seven brothers. The ﬁrst
got married and died without having
children.
21 The second married her and died
without having children. So did the third.
22 None of the seven brothers had any
children. Last of all, the woman died.
23 When the dead come back to life,
whose wife will she be? The seven
brothers had married her."
24 Jesus said to them, "Aren’t you
mistaken because you don’t know the
Scriptures or God’s power?MARK 12
78
25 When the dead come back to life,
they don’t marry. Rather, they are like
the angels in heaven.
26 Haven’t you read in the book of
Moses that the dead come back to life?
It’s in the passage about the bush, where
God said, ‘I am the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.’
27 He’s not the God of the dead but of
the living. You’re badly mistaken!"
28 One of the scribes went to Jesus
during the argument with the Sadducees.
He saw how well Jesus answered them,
so he asked him, "Which commandment
is the most important of them all?"
29 Jesus answered, "The most important
is, ‘Listen, Israel, the Lord our God is the
only Lord.
30 So love the Lord your God with all
your heart, with all your soul, with all
your mind, and with all your strength.’MARK 12
79
31 The second most important
commandment is this: ‘Love your
neighbor as you love yourself.’ No other
commandment is greater than these."
32 The scribe said to Jesus, "Teacher,
that was well said! You’ve told the truth
that there is only one God and no other
besides him!
33 To love him with all your heart, with
all your understanding, with all your
strength, and to love your neighbor as
you love yourself is more important than
all the burnt oﬀerings and sacriﬁces."
34 When Jesus heard how wisely the
man answered, he told the man, "You’re
not too far from the kingdom of God."
A er that, no one dared to ask him
another ques on.
35 While Jesus was teaching in the
temple courtyard, he asked, "How can
the scribes say that the Messiah is
David’s son?MARK 12
80
36 David, guided by the Holy Spirit, said,
‘The Lord said to my Lord: "Take the
highest posi on in heaven un l I put
your enemies under your control."’
37 David calls him Lord. So how can he
be his son?" The large crowd enjoyed
listening to him.
38 As he taught, he said, "Watch out
for the scribes! They like to walk around
in long robes, to be greeted in the
marketplaces,
39 and to have the front seats in
synagogues and the places of honor at
dinners.
40 They rob widows by taking their
houses and then say long prayers
to make themselves look good. The
scribes will receive the most severe
punishment."
41 As Jesus sat facing the temple
oﬀering box, he watched how muchMARK 12 – 13
81
money people put into it. Many rich
people put in large amounts.
42 A poor widow dropped in two small
coins, worth less than a cent.
43 He called his disciples and said to
them, "I can guarantee this truth: This
poor widow has given more than all the
others.
44 All of them have given what they
could spare. But she, in her poverty, has
given everything she had to live on."
1 As Jesus was going out of the
temple courtyard, one of his
disciples said to him, "Teacher, look at
these huge stones and these beau ful
buildings!"
2 Jesus said to him, "Do you see these
large buildings? Not one of these stones
will be le on top of another. Each one
will be torn down."
3 As Jesus was si ng on the Mount of
Olives facing the temple buildings, Peter,
13MARK 13
82
James, John, and Andrew asked him
privately,
4 "Tell us, when will this happen? What
will be the sign when all this will come to
an end?"
5 Jesus answered them, "Be careful not
to let anyone deceive you.
6 Many will come using my name. They
will say, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive
many people.
7 "When you hear of wars and rumors
of wars, don’t be alarmed! These things
must happen, but they don’t mean that
the end has come.
8 Na on will ﬁght against na on and
kingdom against kingdom. There will
be earthquakes and famines in various
places. These are only the beginning
pains of the end.
9 "Be on your guard! People will hand
you over to the Jewish courts and whip
you in their synagogues. You will stand inMARK 13
83
front of governors and kings to tes fy to
them because of me.
10 But ﬁrst, the Good News must be
spread to all na ons.
11 When they take you away to hand
you over to the authori es, don’t worry
ahead of me about what you will say.
Instead, say whatever is given to you to
say when the me comes. Indeed, you
are not the one who will be speaking,
but the Holy Spirit will.
12 "Brother will hand over brother to
death; a father will hand over his child.
Children will rebel against their parents
and kill them.
13 Everyone will hate you because you
are commi ed to me. But the person
who endures to the end will be saved.
14 "When you see the disgus ng thing
that will cause destruc on standing
where it should not (let the reader takeMARK 13
84
note), those of you in Judea should ﬂee
to the mountains.
15 Those who are on the roof should
not come down to get anything out of
their houses.
16 Those who are in the ﬁeld should not
turn back to get their coats.
17 "How horrible it will be for the
women who are pregnant or who are
nursing babies in those days.
18 Pray that it will not be in winter.
19 It will be a me of misery that has not
happened from the beginning of God’s
crea on un l now, and will certainly
never happen again.
20 If the Lord does not reduce that me,
no one will be saved. But those days will
be reduced because of those whom God
has chosen.
21 "At that me don’t believe anyone
who tells you, ‘Here is the Messiah!’ or
‘There he is!’MARK 13
85
22 False messiahs and false prophets will
appear. They will work miraculous signs
and do wonderful things to deceive, if
possible, those whom God has chosen.
23 Be on your guard! I have told you
everything before it happens.
24 "Now, a er the misery of those days,
the sun will turn dark, the moon will not
give light,
25 the stars will fall from the sky, and the
powers of the universe will be shaken.
26 "Then people will see the Son of Man
coming in clouds with great power and
glory.
27 He will send out his angels, and from
every direc on under the sky, they will
gather those whom God has chosen.
28 "Learn from the story of the ﬁg tree.
When its branch becomes tender and
it sprouts leaves, you know summer is
near.MARK 13
86
29 In the same way, when you see these
things happen, you know that he is near,
at the door.
30 "I can guarantee this truth: This
genera on will not disappear un l all
these things take place.
31 The earth and the heavens will
disappear, but my words will never
disappear.
32 "No one knows when that day or
hour will come. Even the angels in
heaven and the Son don’t know. Only
the Father knows.
33 Be careful! Watch! You don’t know
the exact me.
34 It is like a man who went on a trip.
As he le home, he put his servants in
charge. He assigned work to each one
and ordered the guard to be alert.
35 Therefore, be alert, because you
don’t know when the owner of the
house will return. It could be in theMARK 13 – 14
87
evening or at midnight or at dawn or in
the morning.
36 Make sure he doesn’t come suddenly
and ﬁnd you asleep.
37 I’m telling everyone what I’m telling
you: ‘Be alert!’"
1 It was two days before the
Passover and the Fes val of
Unleavened Bread. The chief priests
and the scribes were looking for some
underhanded way to arrest Jesus and to
kill him.
2 However, they said, "We shouldn’t
arrest him during the fes val, or else
there will be a riot among the people."
3 Jesus was in Bethany at the home of
Simon, a man who had suﬀered from
a skin disease. While Jesus was si ng
there, a woman went to him. She had a
bo le of very expensive perfume made
from pure nard. She opened the bo le
and poured the perfume on his head.
14MARK 14
88
4 Some who were there were irritated
and said to one another, "Why was the
perfume wasted like this?
5 This perfume could have been sold for
a high price, and the money could have
been given to the poor." So they said
some very unkind things to her.
6 Jesus said, "Leave her alone! Why
are you bothering her? She has done a
beau ful thing for me.
7 You will always have the poor with
you and can help them whenever you
want. But you will not always have me
with you.
8 She did what she could. She came to
pour perfume on my body before it is
placed in a tomb.
9 I can guarantee this truth: Wherever
the Good News is spoken in the world,
what she has done will also be told in
memory of her."MARK 14
89
10 Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve
apostles, went to the chief priests to
betray Jesus.
11 They were pleased to hear what
Judas had to say and promised to give
him money. So he kept looking for a
chance to betray Jesus.
12 Killing the Passover lamb was
customary on the ﬁrst day of the Fes val
of Unleavened Bread. The disciples
asked Jesus, "Where do you want us to
prepare the Passover meal for you?"
13 He sent two of his disciples and told
them, "Go into the city. You will meet a
man carrying a jug of water. Follow him.
14 When he goes into a house, tell the
owner that the teacher asks, ‘Where is
my room where I can eat the Passover
meal with my disciples?’
15 He will take you upstairs and show
you a large room. The room will beMARK 14
90
completely furnished. Get everything
ready for us there."
16 The disciples le . They went into
the city and found everything as Jesus
had told them. So they prepared the
Passover.
17 When evening came, Jesus arrived
with the twelve apostles.
18 While they were at the table ea ng,
Jesus said, "I can guarantee this truth:
One of you is going to betray me, one
who is ea ng with me!"
19 Feeling hurt, they asked him one by
one, "You don’t mean me, do you?"
20 He said to them, "It’s one of you
twelve, someone dipping his hand into
the bowl with me.
21 The Son of Man is going to die as the
Scriptures say he will. But how horrible
it will be for that person who betrays the
Son of Man! It would have been be erMARK 14
91
for that person if he had never been
born."
22 While they were ea ng, Jesus took
bread and blessed it. He broke the
bread, gave it to them, and said, "Take
this. This is my body."
23 Then he took a cup, spoke a prayer of
thanksgiving, and gave the cup to them.
They all drank from it.
24 He said to them, "This is my blood,
the blood of the promise. It is poured
out for many people.
25 "I can guarantee this truth: I won’t
drink this wine again un l that day when
I drink new wine in the kingdom of God."
26 A er they sang a hymn, they went to
the Mount of Olives.
27 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you
will abandon me. Scripture says, ‘I will
strike the shepherd, and the sheep will
be sca ered.’MARK 14
28 "But a
92
er I am brought back to life, I
will go to Galilee ahead of you."
29 Peter said to him, "Even if everyone
else abandons you, I won’t."
30 Jesus said to Peter, "I can guarantee
this truth: Tonight, before a rooster
crows twice, you will say three mes
that you don’t know me."
31 But Peter said very strongly, "Even if I
have to die with you, I will never say that
I don’t know you." All the other disciples
said the same thing.
32 Then they came to a place called
Gethsemane. He said to his disciples,
"Stay here while I pray."
33 He took Peter, James, and John with
him and began to feel distressed and
anguished.
34 He said to them, "My anguish is so
great that I feel as if I’m dying. Wait here,
and stay awake."MARK 14
35 A
93
er walking a li le farther, he fell
to the ground and prayed that if it were
possible he might not have to suﬀer
what was ahead of him.
36 He said, "Abba! Father! You can do
anything. Take this cup of suﬀering away
from me. But let your will be done rather
than mine."
37 He went back and found them
asleep. He said to Peter, "Simon, are you
sleeping? Couldn’t you stay awake for
one hour?
38 Stay awake, and pray that you won’t
be tempted. You want to do what’s right,
but you’re weak."
39 He went away again and prayed the
same prayer as before.
40 He found them asleep because they
couldn’t keep their eyes open. They
didn’t even know what they should say
to him.MARK 14
41 He came back a third
94
me and said to
them, "You might as well sleep now. It’s
all over. The me has come for the Son
of Man to be handed over to sinners.
42 Get up! Let’s go! The one who is
betraying me is near."
43 Just then, while Jesus was s ll
speaking, Judas, one of the twelve
apostles, arrived. A crowd carrying
swords and clubs was with him. They
were from the chief priests, scribes, and
leaders of the people.
44 Now, the traitor had given them a
signal. He said, "The one I kiss is the man
you want. Arrest him, and guard him
closely as you take him away."
45 Then Judas quickly stepped up to
Jesus and said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.
46 Some men took hold of Jesus and
arrested him.MARK 14
95
47 One of those standing there pulled
out his sword and cut oﬀ the ear of the
chief priest’s servant.
48 Jesus asked them, "Have you come
out with swords and clubs to arrest me
as if I were a criminal?
49 I used to teach in the temple
courtyard every day. But you didn’t
arrest me then. But what the Scriptures
say must come true."
50 Then all the disciples abandoned him
and ran away.
51 A certain young man was following
Jesus. He had nothing on but a linen
sheet. They tried to arrest him,
52 but he le the linen sheet behind
and ran away naked.
53 The men took Jesus to the chief
priest. All the chief priests, leaders, and
scribes had gathered together.
54 Peter followed him at a distance and
went into the chief priest’s courtyard. HeMARK 14
96
sat with the guards and warmed himself
facing the glow of a ﬁre.
55 The chief priests and the whole
Jewish council were searching for some
tes mony against Jesus in order to
execute him. But they couldn’t ﬁnd any.
56 Many gave false tes mony against
him, but their statements did not agree.
57 Then some men stood up and gave
false tes mony against him. They said,
58 "We heard him say, ‘I’ll tear down
this temple made by humans, and in
three days I’ll build another temple, one
not made by human hands.’"
59 But their tes mony did not agree
even on this point.
60 So the chief priest stood up in the
center and asked Jesus, "Don’t you have
any answer to what these men tes fy
against you?"MARK 14
97
61 But he was silent. The chief priest
asked him again, "Are you the Messiah,
the Son of the Blessed One?"
62 Jesus answered, "Yes, I am, and you
will see the Son of Man in the highest
posi on in heaven. He will be coming
with the clouds of heaven."
63 The chief priest tore his clothes in
horror and said, "Why do we need any
more witnesses?
64 You’ve heard him dishonor God!
What’s your verdict?" All of them
condemned him with the death
sentence.
65 Some of them began to spit on him.
They covered his face and hit him with
their ﬁsts. They said to him, "Prophesy!"
Even the guards took him and slapped
him.
66 Peter was in the courtyard. One of
the chief priest’s female servantsMARK 14
98
67 saw Peter warming himself. She
looked at him and said, "You, too, were
with Jesus from Nazareth!"
68 But Peter denied it by saying, "I don’t
know him, and I don’t understand what
you’re talking about." He went to the
entrance. Then a rooster crowed.
69 The servant saw him. Once again she
said to those who were standing around,
"This man is one of them!"
70 Peter again denied it. A er a li le
while the men standing there said to
Peter again, "It’s obvious you’re one of
them. You’re a Galilean!"
71 Then Peter began to curse and swear
with an oath, "I don’t know this man
you’re talking about!"
72 Just then a rooster crowed a second
me. Peter remembered that Jesus said
to him, "Before a rooster crows twice,
you will say three mes that you don’tMARK 15
99
know me." Then Peter began to cry very
hard.
1 Early in the morning the chief
priests immediately came to a
decision with the leaders and the scribes.
The whole Jewish council decided to e
Jesus up, lead him away, and hand him
over to Pilate.
2 Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of
the Jews?" "Yes, I am," Jesus answered
him.
3 The chief priests were accusing him of
many things.
4 So Pilate asked him again, "Don’t
you have any answer? Look how many
accusa ons they’re bringing against
you!"
5 But Jesus no longer answered
anything, so Pilate was surprised.
6 At every Passover fes val, Pilate
would free one prisoner whom the
people asked for.
15MARK 15
100
7 There was a man named Barabbas in
prison. He was with some rebels who
had commi ed murder during a riot.
8 The crowd asked Pilate to do for them
what he always did.
9 Pilate answered them, "Do you want
me to free the king of the Jews for you?"
10 Pilate knew that the chief priests had
handed Jesus over to him because they
were jealous.
11 The chief priests s rred up the crowd
so that Pilate would free Barabbas for
them instead.
12 So Pilate again asked them, "Then
what should I do with the king of the
Jews?"
13 "Crucify him!" they shouted back.
14 Pilate said to them, "Why? What has
he done wrong?" But they shouted even
louder, "Crucify him!"
15 Pilate wanted to sa sfy the people,
so he freed Barabbas for them. But heMARK 15
101
had Jesus whipped and handed over to
be cruciﬁed.
16 The soldiers led Jesus into the
courtyard of the palace and called
together the whole troop.
17 They dressed him in purple, twisted
some thorns into a crown, and placed it
on his head.
18 Then they began to greet him, "Long
live the king of the Jews!"
19 They kept hi ng him on the head
with a s ck, spi ng on him, and kneeling
in front of him with false humility.
20 A er the soldiers ﬁnished making fun
of Jesus, they took oﬀ the purple cape
and put his own clothes back on him.
Then they led him out to crucify him.
21 A man named Simon from the city
of Cyrene was coming into Jerusalem
from his home in the country. He was
the father of Alexander and Rufus. As heMARK 15
102
was about to pass by, the soldiers forced
him to carry Jesus’ cross.
22 They took Jesus to Golgotha (which
means "the place of the skull").
23 They tried to give him wine mixed
with a drug called myrrh, but he
wouldn’t take it.
24 Next they cruciﬁed him. Then they
divided his clothes among themselves
by throwing dice to see what each one
would get.
25 It was nine in the morning when they
cruciﬁed him.
26 There was a wri en no ce of the
accusa on against him. It read, "The king
of the Jews."
27 They cruciﬁed two criminals with
him, one on his right and the other on
his le .
28 (OMITTED TEXT)
29 Those who passed by insulted him.
They shook their heads and said, "WhatMARK 15
103
a joke! You were going to tear down
God’s temple and build it again in three
days.
30 Come down from the cross, and save
yourself!"
31 The chief priests and the scribes
made fun of him among themselves
in the same way. They said, "He saved
others, but he can’t save himself.
32 Let the Messiah, the king of Israel,
come down from the cross now so that
we may see and believe." Even those
who were cruciﬁed with him were
insul ng him.
33 At noon darkness came over the
whole land un l three in the a ernoon.
34 At three o’clock Jesus cried out
in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema
sabachthani?" which means, "My God,
my God, why have you abandoned me?"MARK 15
104
35 When some of the people standing
there heard him say that, they said,
"Listen! He’s calling Elijah."
36 Someone ran and soaked a sponge
in vinegar. Then he put it on a s ck and
oﬀered Jesus a drink. The man said,
"Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him
down."
37 Then Jesus cried out in a loud voice
and died.
38 The curtain in the temple was split in
two from top to bo om.
39 When the oﬃcer who stood facing
Jesus saw how he gave up his spirit, he
said, "Certainly, this man was the Son of
God!"
40 Some women were watching from a
distance. Among them were Mary from
Magdala, Mary (the mother of young
James and Joseph), and Salome.
41 They had followed him and supported
him while he was in Galilee. Many otherMARK 15
105
women who had come to Jerusalem
with him were there too.
42 It was Friday evening, before the day
of worship,
43 when Joseph arrived. He was
from the city of Arimathea and was
an important member of the Jewish
council. He, too, was wai ng for the
kingdom of God. Joseph boldly went to
Pilate’s quarters to ask for the body of
Jesus.
44 Pilate wondered if Jesus had already
died. So he summoned the oﬃcer to ask
him if Jesus was, in fact, dead.
45 When the oﬃcer had assured him
that Jesus was dead, Pilate let Joseph
have the corpse.
46 Joseph had purchased some linen
cloth. He took the body down from the
cross and wrapped it in the cloth. Then
he laid the body in a tomb, which hadMARK 15 – 16
106
been cut out of rock, and he rolled a
stone against the door of the tomb.
47 Mary from Magdala and Mary (the
mother of Joses) watched where Jesus
was laid.
1 When the day of worship was
over, Mary from Magdala, Mary
(the mother of James), and Salome
bought spices to go and anoint Jesus.
2 On Sunday they were going to the
tomb very early when the sun had just
come up.
3 They said to one another, "Who will
roll away the stone for us from the
entrance to the tomb?"
4 When they looked up, they saw that
the stone had been rolled away. It was a
very large stone.
5 As they went into the tomb, they saw
a young man. He was dressed in a white
robe and sat on the right side. They were
panic–stricken.
16MARK 16
107
6 The young man said to them, "Don’t
panic! You’re looking for Jesus from
Nazareth, who was cruciﬁed. He has
been brought back to life. He’s not here.
Look at the place where they laid him.
7 Go and tell his disciples and Peter that
he’s going ahead of them to Galilee.
There they will see him, just as he told
them."
8 They went out of the tomb and
ran away. Shock and trembling had
overwhelmed them. They didn’t say
a thing to anyone, because they were
afraid.
9 A er Jesus came back to life early on
Sunday, he appeared ﬁrst to Mary from
Magdala, from whom he had forced out
seven demons.
10 She went and told his friends, who
were grieving and crying.MARK 16
108
11 They didn’t believe her when they
heard that he was alive and that she had
seen him.
12 Later Jesus appeared to two disciples
as they were walking to their home in
the country. He did not look as he usually
did.
13 They went back and told the others,
who did not believe them either.
14 S ll later Jesus appeared to the
eleven apostles while they were ea ng.
He put them to shame for their unbelief
and because they were too stubborn to
believe those who had seen him alive.
15 Then Jesus said to them, "So
wherever you go in the world, tell
everyone the Good News.
16 Whoever believes and is bap zed will
be saved, but whoever does not believe
will be condemned.
17 "These are the miraculous signs that
will accompany believers: They will useMARK 16
109
the power and authority of my name to
force demons out of people. They will
speak new languages.
18 They will pick up snakes, and if they
drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt
them. They will place their hands on the
sick and cure them."
19 A er talking with the apostles, the
Lord was taken to heaven, where God
gave him the highest posi on.
20 The disciples spread the Good News
everywhere. The Lord worked with
them. He conﬁrmed his word by the
miraculous signs that accompanied it.Luke

1 Many have a
empted to write
about what had taken place among
us.
2 They received their informa on from
those who had been eyewitnesses
and servants of God’s word from the
beginning, and they passed it on to us.
3 I, too, have followed everything
closely from the beginning. So I thought
it would be a good idea to write an
orderly account for Your Excellency,
Theophilus.
4 In this way you will know that what
you’ve been told is true.
5 When Herod was king of Judea,
there was a priest named Zechariah,
who belonged to the division of priestsLUKE 1
2
named a er Abijah. Zechariah’s wife
Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron.
6 Zechariah and Elizabeth had God’s
approval. They followed all the Lord’s
commands and regula ons perfectly.
7 Yet, they never had any children
because Elizabeth couldn’t become
pregnant. Both of them were too old to
have children.
8 Zechariah was on duty with his
division of priests. As he served in God’s
presence,
9 he was chosen by priestly custom
to go into the Lord’s temple to burn
incense.
10 All the people were praying outside
while he was burning incense.
11 Then, to the right of the incense altar,
an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
12 Zechariah was troubled and
overcome with fear.LUKE 1
3
13 The angel said to him, "Don’t be
afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your
prayer. Your wife Elizabeth will have a
son, and you will name him John.
14 He will be your pride and joy, and
many people will be glad that he was
born.
15 As far as the Lord is concerned, he
will be a great man. He will never drink
wine or any other liquor. He will be ﬁlled
with the Holy Spirit even before he is
born.
16 He will bring many people in Israel
back to the Lord their God.
17 He will go ahead of the Lord with the
spirit and power that Elijah had. He will
change parents’ a tudes toward their
children. He will change disobedient
people so that they will accept the
wisdom of those who have God’s
approval. In this way he will prepare the
people for their Lord."LUKE 1
4
18 Zechariah said to the angel, "What
proof is there for this? I’m an old man,
and my wife is beyond her childbearing
years."
19 The angel answered him, "I’m
Gabriel! I stand in God’s presence. God
sent me to tell you this good news.
20 But because you didn’t believe what
I said, you will be unable to talk un l the
day this happens. Everything will come
true at the right me."
21 Meanwhile, the people were wai ng
for Zechariah. They were amazed that he
was staying in the temple so long.
22 When he did come out, he was
unable to speak to them. So they
realized that he had seen a vision in
the temple. He mo oned to them but
remained unable to talk.
23 When the days of his service were
over, he went home.LUKE 1
5
24 Later, his wife Elizabeth became
pregnant and didn’t go out in public for
ﬁve months. She said,
25 "The Lord has done this for me now.
He has removed my public disgrace."
26 Six months a er Elizabeth had
become pregnant, God sent the angel
Gabriel to Nazareth, a city in Galilee.
27 The angel went to a virgin promised
in marriage to a descendant of David
named Joseph. The virgin’s name was
Mary.
28 When the angel entered her home,
he greeted her and said, "You are favored
by the Lord! The Lord is with you."
29 She was startled by what the angel
said and tried to ﬁgure out what this
gree ng meant.
30 The angel told her, "Don’t be afraid,
Mary. You have found favor with God.
31 You will become pregnant, give birth
to a son, and name him Jesus.LUKE 1
6
32 He will be a great man and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The
Lord God will give him the throne of his
ancestor David.
33 Your son will be king of Jacob’s
people forever, and his kingdom will
never end."
34 Mary asked the angel, "How can this
be? I’ve never had sexual intercourse."
35 The angel answered her, "The Holy
Spirit will come to you, and the power
of the Most High will overshadow you.
Therefore, the holy child developing
inside you will be called the Son of God.
36 "Elizabeth, your rela ve, is six
months pregnant with a son in her old
age. People said she couldn’t have a
child.
37 But nothing is impossible for God."
38 Mary answered, "I am the Lord’s
servant. Let everything you’ve said
happen to me." Then the angel le her.LUKE 1
39 Soon a
7
erward, Mary hurried to a
city in the mountain region of Judah.
40 She entered Zechariah’s home and
greeted Elizabeth.
41 When Elizabeth heard the gree ng,
she felt the baby kick. Elizabeth was
ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit.
42 She said in a loud voice, "You are the
most blessed of all women, and blessed
is the child that you will have.
43 I feel blessed that the mother of my
Lord is visi ng me.
44 As soon as I heard your gree ng, I
felt the baby jump for joy.
45 You are blessed for believing that the
Lord would keep his promise to you."
46 Mary said, "My soul praises the
Lord’s greatness!
47 My spirit ﬁnds its joy in God, my
Savior,LUKE 1
8
48 because he has looked favorably on
me, his humble servant. "From now on,
all people will call me blessed
49 because the Almighty has done great
things to me. His name is holy.
50 For those who fear him, his mercy
lasts throughout every genera on.
51 "He displayed his mighty power. He
sca ered those who think too highly of
themselves.
52 He pulled strong rulers from their
thrones. He honored humble people.
53 He fed hungry people with good
food. He sent rich people away with
nothing.
54 "He remembered to help his servant
Israel forever.
55 This is the promise he made to
our ancestors, to Abraham and his
descendants."
56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about
three months and then went back home.LUKE 1
57 When the
9
me came for Elizabeth to
have her child, she gave birth to a son.
58 Her neighbors and rela ves heard
that the Lord had been very kind to her,
and they shared her joy.
59 When the child was eight days old,
they went to the temple to circumcise
him. They were going to name him
Zechariah a er his father.
60 But his mother spoke up, "Absolutely
not! His name will be John."
61 Their friends said to her, "But you
don’t have any rela ves with that name."
62 So they mo oned to the baby’s
father to see what he wanted to name
the child.
63 Zechariah asked for a wri ng tablet
and wrote, "His name is John." Everyone
was amazed.
64 Suddenly, Zechariah was able to
speak, and he began to praise God.LUKE 1
10
65 All their neighbors were ﬁlled with
awe. Throughout the mountain region of
Judea, people talked about everything
that had happened.
66 Everyone who heard about it
seriously thought it over and asked,
"What does the future hold for this
child?" It was clear that the Lord was
with him.
67 His father Zechariah was ﬁlled with
the Holy Spirit and prophesied,
68 "Praise the Lord God of Israel! He has
come to take care of his people and to
set them free.
69 He has raised up a mighty Savior for
us in the family of his servant David.
70 He made this promise through his
holy prophets long ago.
71 He promised to save us from our
enemies and from the power of all who
hate us.LUKE 1
11
72 He has shown his mercy to our
ancestors and remembered his holy
promise,
73 the oath that he swore to our
ancestor Abraham.
74 He promised to rescue us from our
enemies’ power so that we could serve
him without fear
75 by being holy and honorable as long
as we live.
76 "You, child, will be called a prophet
of the Most High. You will go ahead of
the Lord to prepare his way.
77 You will make his people know
that they can be saved through the
forgiveness of their sins.
78 A new day will dawn on us from
above because our God is loving and
merciful.
79 He will give light to those who live in
the dark and in death’s shadow. He will
guide us into the way of peace."LUKE 1 – 2
12
80 The child John grew and became
spiritually strong. He lived in the desert
un l the day he appeared to the people
of Israel.
1 At that me the Emperor Augustus
ordered a census of the Roman
Empire.
2 This was the ﬁrst census taken while
Quirinius was governor of Syria.
3 All the people went to register in the
ci es where their ancestors had lived.
4 So Joseph went from Nazareth, a
city in Galilee, to a Judean city called
Bethlehem. Joseph, a descendant of
King David, went to Bethlehem because
David had been born there.
5 Joseph went there to register with
Mary. She had been promised to him in
marriage and was pregnant.
6 While they were in Bethlehem, the
me came for Mary to have her child.
2LUKE 2
13
7 She gave birth to her ﬁrstborn son.
She wrapped him in strips of cloth and
laid him in a manger because there
wasn’t any room for them in the inn.
8 Shepherds were in the ﬁelds near
Bethlehem. They were taking turns
watching their ﬂock during the night.
9 An angel from the Lord suddenly
appeared to them. The glory of the Lord
ﬁlled the area with light, and they were
terriﬁed.
10 The angel said to them, "Don’t be
afraid! I have good news for you, a
message that will ﬁll everyone with joy.
11 Today your Savior, Christ the Lord,
was born in David’s city.
12 This is how you will recognize him:
You will ﬁnd an infant wrapped in strips
of cloth and lying in a manger."
13 Suddenly, a large army of angels
appeared with the angel. They were
praising God by saying,LUKE 2
14
14 "Glory to God in the highest heaven,
and on earth peace to those who have
his good will!"
15 The angels le them and went back
to heaven. The shepherds said to each
other, "Let’s go to Bethlehem and see
what the Lord has told us about."
16 They went quickly and found Mary
and Joseph with the baby, who was lying
in a manger.
17 When they saw the child, they
repeated what they had been told about
him.
18 Everyone who heard the shepherds’
story was amazed.
19 Mary treasured all these things in her
heart and always thought about them.
20 As the shepherds returned to their
ﬂock, they gloriﬁed and praised God for
everything they had seen and heard.
Everything happened the way the angel
had told them.LUKE 2
21 Eight days a
15
er his birth, the child
was circumcised and named Jesus. This
was the name the angel had given him
before his mother became pregnant.
22 A er the days required by Moses’
Teachings to make a mother clean
had passed, Joseph and Mary went to
Jerusalem. They took Jesus to present
him to the Lord.
23 They did exactly what was wri en
in the Lord’s Teachings: "Every ﬁrstborn
boy is to be set apart as holy to the
Lord."
24 They also oﬀered a sacriﬁce as
required by the Lord’s Teachings: "a
pair of mourning doves or two young
pigeons."
25 A man named Simeon was in
Jerusalem. He lived an honorable and
devout life. He was wai ng for the one
who would comfort Israel. The Holy
Spirit was with SimeonLUKE 2
16
26 and had told him that he wouldn’t
die un l he had seen the Messiah, whom
the Lord would send.
27 Moved by the Spirit, Simeon went
into the temple courtyard. Mary and
Joseph were bringing the child Jesus into
the courtyard at the same me. They
brought him so that they could do for
him what Moses’ Teachings required.
28 Then Simeon took the child in his
arms and praised God by saying,
29 "Now, Lord, you are allowing your
servant to leave in peace as you
promised.
30 My eyes have seen your salva on,
31 which you have prepared for all
people to see.
32 He is a light that will reveal salva on
to the na ons and bring glory to your
people Israel."
33 Jesus’ father and mother were
amazed at what was said about him.LUKE 2
17
34 Then Simeon blessed them and said
to Mary, his mother, "This child is the
reason that many people in Israel will
be condemned and many others will be
saved. He will be a sign that will expose
35 the thoughts of those who reject
him. And a sword will pierce your heart."
36 Anna, a prophet, was also there. She
was a descendant of Phanuel from the
tribe of Asher. She was now very old. Her
husband had died seven years a er they
were married,
37 and she had been a widow for
84 years. Anna never le the temple
courtyard but worshiped day and night
by fas ng and praying.
38 At that moment she came up to Mary
and Joseph and began to thank God.
She spoke about Jesus to all who were
wai ng for Jerusalem to be set free.
39 A er doing everything the Lord’s
Teachings required, Joseph and MaryLUKE 2
18
returned to their hometown of Nazareth
in Galilee.
40 The child grew and became strong.
He was ﬁlled with wisdom, and God’s
favor was with him.
41 Every year Jesus’ parents would go to
Jerusalem for the Passover fes val.
42 When he was 12 years old, they went
as usual.
43 When the fes val was over, they le
for home. The boy Jesus stayed behind in
Jerusalem, but his parents didn’t know
it.
44 They thought that he was with the
others who were traveling with them.
A er traveling for a day, they started to
look for him among their rela ves and
friends.
45 When they didn’t ﬁnd him, they went
back to Jerusalem to look for him.
46 Three days later, they found him in
the temple courtyard. He was si ngLUKE 2 – 3
19
among the teachers, listening to them,
and asking them ques ons.
47 His understanding and his answers
stunned everyone who heard him.
48 When his parents saw him, they
were shocked. His mother asked him,
"Son, why have you done this to us?
Your father and I have been worried sick
looking for you!"
49 Jesus said to them, "Why were you
looking for me? Didn’t you realize that I
had to be in my Father’s house?"
50 But they didn’t understand what he
meant.
51 Then he returned with them to
Nazareth and was obedient to them. His
mother treasured all these things in her
heart.
52 Jesus grew in wisdom and maturity.
He gained favor from God and people.
1 It was the ﬁ eenth year in the reign
of the Emperor Tiberius. Pon us

20
Pilate was governor of Judea. Herod
ruled Galilee, and his brother Philip
ruled Iturea and Trachoni s. Lysanias
was the ruler of Abilene.
2 It was at the me when Annas and
Caiaphas were chief priests that God
spoke to John, son of Zechariah, in the
desert.
3 John traveled throughout the region
around the Jordan River. He told people
about a bap sm of repentance for the
forgiveness of sins.
4 As the prophet Isaiah wrote in his
book, "A voice cries out in the desert:
‘Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his
paths straight!
5 Every valley will be ﬁlled. Every
mountain and hill will be leveled. The
crooked ways will be made straight. The
rough roads will be made smooth.
6 All people will see the salva on that
God gives.’"LUKE 3
21
7 Crowds of people were coming to be
bap zed by John. He would say to them,
"You poisonous snakes! Who showed
you how to ﬂee from God’s coming
anger?
8 Do those things that prove that you
have turned to God and have changed
the way you think and act. Don’t say,
‘Abraham is our ancestor.’ I guarantee
that God can raise up descendants for
Abraham from these stones.
9 The ax is now ready to cut the roots of
the trees. Any tree that doesn’t produce
good fruit will be cut down and thrown
into a ﬁre."
10 The crowds asked him, "What should
we do?"
11 He answered them, "Whoever has
two shirts should share with the person
who doesn’t have any. Whoever has
food should share it too."LUKE 3
22
12 Some tax collectors came to be
bap zed. They asked him, "Teacher,
what should we do?"
13 He told them, "Don’t collect more
money than you are ordered to collect."
14 Some soldiers asked him, "And what
should we do?" He told them, "Be
sa sﬁed with your pay, and never use
threats or blackmail to get money from
anyone."
15 People’s hopes were rising as they
all wondered whether John was the
Messiah.
16 John replied to all of them, "I bap ze
you with water. But the one who is more
powerful than I is coming. I am not
worthy to un e his sandal straps. He will
bap ze you with the Holy Spirit and ﬁre.
17 His winnowing shovel is in his hand
to clean up his threshing ﬂoor. He will
gather the wheat into his barn, but heLUKE 3
23
will burn the husks in a ﬁre that can
never be put out."
18 With many other encouraging words,
he told the Good News to the people.
19 John spoke out against the ruler
Herod because Herod had married his
own sister–in–law, Herodias. He also
spoke out against Herod for all the evil
things he had done.
20 So Herod added one more evil to all
the others; he locked John in prison.
21 When all the people were bap zed,
Jesus, too, was bap zed. While he was
praying, heaven opened,
22 and the Holy Spirit came down to
him in the form of a dove. A voice from
heaven said, "You are my Son, whom I
love. I am pleased with you."

1 Jesus was ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit
as he le the Jordan River. The Spirit
led him while he was in the desert,
2 where he was tempted by the devil
for 40 days. During those days Jesus ate
nothing, so when they were over, he was
hungry.
3 The devil said to him, "If you are the
Son of God, tell this stone to become a
loaf of bread."
4LUKE 4
26
4 Jesus answered him, "Scripture says,
‘A person cannot live on bread alone.’"
5 The devil took him to a high place
and showed him all the kingdoms of the
world in an instant.
6 The devil said to him, "I will give
you all the power and glory of these
kingdoms. All of it has been given to me,
and I give it to anyone I please.
7 So if you will worship me, all this will
be yours."
8 Jesus answered him, "Scripture says,
‘Worship the Lord your God and serve
only him.’"
9 Then the devil took him into Jerusalem
and had him stand on the highest part of
the temple. He said to Jesus, "If you are
the Son of God, jump from here!
10 Scripture says, ‘He will put his angels
in charge of you to watch over you
carefully.LUKE 4
27
11 They will carry you in their hands so
that you never hit your foot against a
rock.’"
12 Jesus answered him, "It has been
said, ‘Never tempt the Lord your God.’"
13 A er the devil had ﬁnished temp ng
Jesus in every possible way, the devil le
him un l another me.
14 Jesus returned to Galilee. The power
of the Spirit was with him, and the
news about him spread throughout the
surrounding country.
15 He taught in the synagogues, and
everyone praised him.
16 Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where
he had been brought up. As usual he
went into the synagogue on the day of
worship. He stood up to read the lesson.
17 The a endant gave him the book of
the prophet Isaiah. He opened it and
found the place where it read:LUKE 4
28
18 "The Spirit of the Lord is with me. He
has anointed me to tell the Good News
to the poor. He has sent me to announce
forgiveness to the prisoners of sin and
the restoring of sight to the blind, to
forgive those who have been sha ered
by sin,
19 to announce the year of the Lord’s
favor."
20 Jesus closed the book, gave it back to
the a endant, and sat down. Everyone
in the synagogue watched him closely.
21 Then he said to them, "This passage
came true today when you heard me
read it."
22 All the people spoke well of him.
They were amazed to hear the gracious
words ﬂowing from his lips. They said,
"Isn’t this Joseph’s son?"
23 So he said to them, "You’ll probably
quote this proverb to me, ‘Doctor, cure
yourself!’ and then say to me, ‘Do allLUKE 4
29
the things in your hometown that we’ve
heard you’ve done in Capernaum.’"
24 Then Jesus added, "I can guarantee
this truth: A prophet isn’t accepted in his
hometown.
25 "I can guarantee this truth: There
were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s
me. It had not rained for three–and–
a–half years, and the famine was severe
everywhere in the country.
26 But God didn’t send Elijah to anyone
except a widow at Zarephath in the
territory of Sidon.
27 There were also many people with
skin diseases in Israel in the prophet
Elisha’s me. But God cured no one
except Naaman from Syria."
28 Everyone in the synagogue became
furious when they heard this.
29 Their city was built on a hill with a
cliﬀ. So they got up, forced Jesus out ofLUKE 4
30
the city, and led him to the cliﬀ. They
intended to throw him oﬀ of it.
30 But Jesus walked right by them and
went away.
31 Jesus went to Capernaum, a city in
Galilee, and taught them on a day of
worship.
32 The people were amazed at his
teachings because he spoke with
authority.
33 In the synagogue was a man
possessed by a spirit, an evil demon. He
shouted very loudly,
34 "Oh, no! What do you want with us,
Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to
destroy us? I know who you are––the
Holy One of God!"
35 Jesus ordered the spirit, "Keep quiet,
and come out of him!" The demon
threw the man down in the middle of
the synagogue and came out without
hur ng him.LUKE 4
31
36 Everyone was stunned. They said to
one another, "What kind of command is
this? With authority and power he gives
orders to evil spirits, and they come
out."
37 So news about him spread to every
place throughout the surrounding
region.
38 Jesus le the synagogue and went to
Simon’s house. Simon’s mother–in–law
was sick with a high fever. They asked
Jesus to help her.
39 He bent over her, ordered the fever
to leave, and it went away. She got up
immediately and prepared a meal for
them.
40 When the sun was se ng, everyone
who had friends suﬀering from various
diseases brought them to him. He placed
his hands on each of them and cured
them.LUKE 4 – 5
32
41 Demons came out of many people,
shou ng, "You are the Son of God!" But
Jesus ordered them not to speak. A er
all, they knew he was the Messiah.
42 In the morning he went to a place
where he could be alone. The crowds
searched for him. When they came to
him, they tried to keep him from leaving.
43 But he said to them, "I have to tell
the Good News about the kingdom of
God in other ci es also. That’s what I
was sent to do."
44 So he spread his message in the
synagogues of Judea.
1 One day Jesus was standing by the
Sea of Galilee. The people crowded
around him as they listened to God’s
word.
2 Jesus saw two boats on the shore. The
ﬁshermen had stepped out of them and
were washing their nets.
5LUKE 5
33
3 So Jesus got into the boat that
belonged to Simon and asked him to
push oﬀ a li le from the shore. Then
Jesus sat down and taught the crowd
from the boat.
4 When he ﬁnished speaking, he told
Simon, "Take the boat into deep water,
and lower your nets to catch some ﬁsh."
5 Simon answered, "Teacher, we worked
hard all night and caught nothing. But if
you say so, I’ll lower the nets."
6 A er the men had done this, they
caught such a large number of ﬁsh that
their nets began to tear.
7 So they signaled to their partners in
the other boat to come and help them.
Their partners came and ﬁlled both
boats un l the boats nearly sank.
8 When Simon Peter saw this, he knelt
in front of Jesus and said, "Leave me,
Lord! I’m a sinful person!"LUKE 5
34
9 Simon and everyone who was with
him was amazed to see the large number
of ﬁsh they had caught.
10 James and John, who were Zebedee’s
sons and Simon’s partners, were also
amazed. Jesus told Simon, "Don’t be
afraid. From now on you will catch
people instead of ﬁsh."
11 Simon and his partners brought the
boats to shore, le everything, and
followed Jesus.
12 One day Jesus was in a city where
there was a man covered with a serious
skin disease. When the man saw Jesus,
he bowed with his face to the ground.
He begged Jesus, "Sir, if you want to, you
can make me clean."
13 Jesus reached out, touched him,
and said, "I want to. So be clean!"
Immediately, his skin disease went away.
14 Jesus ordered him, "Don’t tell
anyone. Instead, show yourself to theLUKE 5
35
priest. Then oﬀer the sacriﬁce as Moses
commanded as proof to people that you
are clean."
15 The news about Jesus spread even
more. Large crowds gathered to hear
him and have their diseases cured.
16 But he would go away to places
where he could be alone for prayer.
17 One day when Jesus was teaching,
some Pharisees and experts in Moses’
Teachings were present. They had come
from every village in Galilee and Judea
and from Jerusalem. Jesus had the
power of the Lord to heal.
18 Some men brought a paralyzed man
on a stretcher. They tried to take him
into the house and put him in front of
Jesus.
19 But they could not ﬁnd a way to
get him into the house because of the
crowd. So they went up on the roof. They
made an opening in the les and let theLUKE 5
36
man down on his stretcher among the
people. (They lowered him in front of
Jesus.)
20 When Jesus saw their faith, he said,
"Sir, your sins are forgiven."
21 The scribes and the Pharisees
thought, "Who is this man? He’s
dishonoring God! Who besides God can
forgive sins?"
22 Jesus knew what they were thinking.
So he said to them, "What are you
thinking?
23 Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are
forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
24 I want you to know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
"Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go
home."
25 The man immediately stood up
in front of them and picked up theLUKE 5
37
stretcher he had been lying on. Praising
God, he went home.
26 Everyone was amazed and praised
God. They were ﬁlled with awe and said,
"We’ve seen things today we can hardly
believe!"
27 A er that, Jesus le . He saw a tax
collector named Levi si ng in a tax
oﬃce. Jesus said to him, "Follow me!"
28 So Levi got up, le everything, and
followed him.
29 Levi held a large recep on at his
home for Jesus. A huge crowd of tax
collectors and others were ea ng with
them.
30 The Pharisees and their scribes
complained to Jesus’ disciples. They
asked, "Why do you eat and drink with
tax collectors and sinners?"
31 Jesus answered them, "Healthy
people don’t need a doctor; those who
are sick do.LUKE 5
38
32 I’ve come to call sinners to change
the way they think and act, not to
call people who think they have God’s
approval."
33 They said to him, "John’s disciples
frequently fast and say prayers, and so
do the disciples of the Pharisees. But
your disciples eat and drink."
34 Jesus asked them, "Can you force
wedding guests to fast while the groom
is s ll with them?
35 The me will come when the groom
will be taken away from them. At that
me they will fast."
36 He also used these illustra ons: "No
one tears a piece of cloth from a new
coat to patch an old coat. Otherwise, the
new cloth will tear the old. Besides, the
patch from the new will not match the
old.
37 People don’t pour new wine into old
wineskins. If they do, the new wine willLUKE 5 – 6
39
make the skins burst. The wine will run
out, and the skins will be ruined.
38 Rather, new wine is to be poured into
fresh skins.
39 "No one who has been drinking old
wine wants new wine. He says, ‘The old
wine is be er!’"
1 Once, on a day of worship,
Jesus was walking through some
grainﬁelds. His disciples were picking the
heads of grain, removing the husks, and
ea ng the grain.
2 Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why
are your disciples doing something that
is not right to do on the day of worship?"
3 Jesus answered them, "Haven’t you
read what David did when he and his
men were hungry?
4 Haven’t you read how he went into
the house of God, ate the bread of the
presence, and gave some of it to the
men who were with him? He had no
6LUKE 6
40
right to eat those loaves. Only the priests
have that right."
5 Then he added, "The Son of Man has
authority over the day of worship."
6 On another day of worship, Jesus
went into a synagogue to teach. A man
whose right hand was paralyzed was
there.
7 The scribes and the Pharisees were
watching Jesus closely. They wanted to
see whether he would heal the man
on the day of worship so that they
could ﬁnd a way to accuse him of doing
something wrong.
8 But Jesus knew what they were
thinking. So he told the man with the
paralyzed hand, "Get up, and stand in
the center of the synagogue!" The man
got up and stood there.
9 Then Jesus said to them, "I ask
you––what is the right thing to do onLUKE 6
41
a day of worship: to do good or evil, to
give a person his health or to destroy it?"
10 He looked around at all of them and
then said to the man, "Hold out your
hand." The man did so, and his hand
became normal again.
11 The scribes and Pharisees were
furious and began to discuss with each
other what they could do to Jesus.
12 At that me Jesus went to a mountain
to pray. He spent the whole night in
prayer to God.
13 When it was day, he called his
disciples. He chose twelve of them and
called them apostles.
14 They were Simon (whom Jesus
named Peter) and Simon’s brother
Andrew, James, John, Philip,
Bartholomew,
15 Ma hew, Thomas, James (son of
Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the
Zealot),LUKE 6
42
16 Judas (son of James), and Judas
Iscariot (who became a traitor).
17 Jesus came down from the mountain
with them and stood on a level place. A
large crowd of his disciples and many
other people were there. They had come
from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the
seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.
18 They wanted to hear him and be
cured of their diseases. Those who were
tormented by evil spirits were cured.
19 The en re crowd was trying to touch
him because power was coming from
him and curing all of them.
20 Jesus looked at his disciples and said,
"Blessed are those who are poor. The
kingdom of God is theirs.
21 Blessed are those who are hungry.
They will be sa sﬁed. Blessed are those
who are crying. They will laugh.
22 Blessed are you when people hate
you, avoid you, insult you, and slanderLUKE 6
43
you because you are commi ed to the
Son of Man.
23 Rejoice then, and be very happy! You
have a great reward in heaven. That’s
the way their ancestors treated the
prophets.
24 "But how horrible it will be for
those who are rich. They have had their
comfort.
25 How horrible it will be for those who
are well–fed. They will be hungry. How
horrible it will be for those who are
laughing. They will mourn and cry.
26 How horrible it will be for you when
everyone says nice things about you.
That’s the way their ancestors treated
the false prophets.
27 "But I tell everyone who is listening:
Love your enemies. Be kind to those
who hate you.
28 Bless those who curse you. Pray for
those who insult you.LUKE 6
44
29 If someone strikes you on the cheek,
oﬀer the other cheek as well. If someone
takes your coat, don’t stop him from
taking your shirt.
30 Give to everyone who asks you for
something. If someone takes what is
yours, don’t insist on ge ng it back.
31 "Do for other people everything you
want them to do for you.
32 "If you love those who love you, do
you deserve any thanks for that? Even
sinners love those who love them.
33 If you help those who help you, do
you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners
do that too.
34 If you lend anything to those from
whom you expect to get something
back, do you deserve any thanks for
that? Sinners also lend to sinners to get
back what they lend.
35 Rather, love your enemies, help
them, and lend to them withoutLUKE 6
45
expec ng to get anything back. Then you
will have a great reward. You will be the
children of the Most High God. A er all,
he is kind to unthankful and evil people.
36 Be merciful as your Father is merciful.
37 "Stop judging, and you will never be
judged. Stop condemning, and you will
never be condemned. Forgive, and you
will be forgiven.
38 Give, and you will receive. A large
quan ty, pressed together, shaken
down, and running over will be put into
your pocket. The standards you use for
others will be applied to you."
39 Jesus also gave them this illustra on:
"Can one blind person lead another?
Won’t both fall into the same pit?
40 A student is no be er than his
teacher. But everyone who is well–
trained will be like his teacher.
41 "Why do you see the piece of
sawdust in another believer’s eye andLUKE 6
46
not no ce the wooden beam in your
own eye?
42 How can you say to another believer,
‘Friend, let me take the piece of sawdust
out of your eye,’ when you don’t see the
beam in your own eye? You hypocrite!
First remove the beam from your own
eye. Then you will see clearly to remove
the piece of sawdust from another
believer’s eye.
43 "A good tree doesn’t produce ro en
fruit, and a ro en tree doesn’t produce
good fruit.
44 Each tree is known by its fruit. You
don’t pick ﬁgs from thorny plants or
grapes from a thornbush.
45 Good people do the good that is in
them. But evil people do the evil that
is in them. The things people say come
from inside them.
46 "Why do you call me Lord but don’t
do what I tell you?LUKE 6 – 7
47
47 "I will show you what everyone who
comes to me, hears what I say, and
obeys it is like.
48 He is like a person who dug down
to bedrock to lay the founda on of
his home. When a ﬂood came, the
ﬂoodwaters pushed against that house.
But the house couldn’t be washed away
because it had a good founda on.
49 The person who hears what I say
but doesn’t obey it is like someone who
built a house on the ground without
any founda on. The ﬂoodwaters pushed
against it, and that house quickly
collapsed and was destroyed."
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished everything
he wanted to say to the people, he
went to Capernaum.
2 There a Roman army oﬃcer’s valuable
slave was sick and near death.
3 The oﬃcer had heard about Jesus and
sent some Jewish leaders to him. They
7LUKE 7
48
were to ask Jesus to come and save the
servant’s life.
4 They came to Jesus and begged, "He
deserves your help.
5 He loves our people and built our
synagogue at his own expense."
6 Jesus went with them. He was not far
from the house when the oﬃcer sent
friends to tell Jesus, "Sir, don’t bother. I
don’t deserve to have you come into my
house.
7 That’s why I didn’t come to you. But
just give a command, and let my servant
be cured.
8 As you know, I’m in a chain of
command and have soldiers at my
command. I tell one of them, ‘Go!’ and
he goes, and another, ‘Come!’ and he
comes. I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and
he does it."
9 Jesus was amazed at the oﬃcer when
he heard these words. He turned to theLUKE 7
49
crowd following him and said, "I can
guarantee that I haven’t found faith as
great as this in Israel."
10 When the men who had been sent
returned to the house, they found the
servant healthy again.
11 Soon a erward, Jesus went to a city
called Nain. His disciples and a large
crowd went with him.
12 As he came near the entrance to the
city, he met a funeral procession. The
dead man was a widow’s only child. A
large crowd from the city was with her.
13 When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry
for her. He said to her, "Don’t cry."
14 He went up to the open coﬃn,
took hold of it, and the men who were
carrying it stopped. He said, "Young man,
I’m telling you to come back to life!"
15 The dead man sat up and began to
talk, and Jesus gave him back to his
mother.LUKE 7
50
16 Everyone was struck with fear and
praised God. They said, "A great prophet
has appeared among us," and "God has
taken care of his people."
17 This news about Jesus spread
throughout Judea and the surrounding
region.
18 John’s disciples told him about all
these things. Then John called two of his
disciples
19 and sent them to ask the Lord, "Are
you the one who is coming, or should we
look for someone else?"
20 The men came to Jesus and said,
"John the Bap zer sent us to ask you,
‘Are you the one who is coming, or
should we look for someone else?’"
21 At that me Jesus was curing many
people who had diseases, sicknesses,
and evil spirits. Also, he was giving back
sight to many who were blind.LUKE 7
51
22 Jesus answered John’s disciples, "Go
back, and tell John what you have seen
and heard: Blind people see again, lame
people are walking, those with skin
diseases are made clean, deaf people
hear again, dead people are brought
back to life, and poor people hear the
Good News.
23 Whoever doesn’t lose his faith in me
is indeed blessed."
24 When John’s messengers had le ,
Jesus spoke to the crowds about John.
"What did you go into the desert to see?
Tall grass swaying in the wind?
25 Really, what did you go to see? A man
dressed in ﬁne clothes? Those who wear
splendid clothes and live in luxury are in
royal palaces.
26 Really, what did you go to see? A
prophet? Let me tell you that he is far
more than a prophet.LUKE 7
52
27 John is the one about whom Scripture
says, ‘I am sending my messenger ahead
of you to prepare the way in front of
you.’
28 I can guarantee that of all the people
ever born, no one is greater than John.
Yet, the least important person in the
kingdom of God is greater than John.
29 "All the people, including tax
collectors, heard John. They admi ed
that God was right by le ng John
bap ze them.
30 But the Pharisees and the experts in
Moses’ Teachings rejected God’s plan for
them. They refused to be bap zed.
31 "How can I describe the people who
are living now? What are they like?
32 They are like children who sit in the
marketplace and shout to each other,
‘We played music for you, but you didn’t
dance. We sang a funeral song, but you
didn’t cry.’LUKE 7
33 John the Bap
53
zer has come neither
ea ng bread nor drinking wine, and you
say, ‘There’s a demon in him!’
34 The Son of Man has come ea ng and
drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! He’s
a glu on and a drunk, a friend of tax
collectors and sinners!’
35 "Yet, wisdom is proved right by all its
results."
36 One of the Pharisees invited Jesus
to eat with him. Jesus went to the
Pharisee’s house and was ea ng at the
table.
37 A woman who lived a sinful life in
that city found out that Jesus was ea ng
at the Pharisee’s house. So she took a
bo le of perfume
38 and knelt at his feet. She was crying
and washed his feet with her tears. Then
she dried his feet with her hair, kissed
them over and over again, and poured
the perfume on them.LUKE 7
54
39 The Pharisee who had invited Jesus
saw this and thought, "If this man really
were a prophet, he would know what
sort of woman is touching him. She’s a
sinner."
40 Jesus spoke up, "Simon, I have
something to say to you." Simon replied,
"Teacher, you’re free to speak."
41 So Jesus said, "Two men owed a
moneylender some money. One owed
him ﬁve hundred silver coins, and the
other owed him ﬁ y.
42 When they couldn’t pay it back, he
was kind enough to cancel their debts.
Now, who do you think will love him the
most?"
43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one
who had the largest debt canceled."
Jesus said to him, "You’re right!"
44 Then, turning to the woman, he said
to Simon, "You see this woman, don’t
you? I came into your house. You didn’tLUKE 7 – 8
55
wash my feet. But she has washed my
feet with her tears and dried them with
her hair.
45 You didn’t give me a kiss. But ever
since I came in, she has not stopped
kissing my feet.
46 You didn’t put any olive oil on my
head. But she has poured perfume on
my feet.
47 That’s why I’m telling you that her
many sins have been forgiven. Her great
love proves that. But whoever receives
li le forgiveness loves very li le."
48 Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins
have been forgiven."
49 The other guests thought, "Who is
this man who even forgives sins?"
50 Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith
has saved you. Go in peace!"
1 A er this, Jesus traveled from one
city and village to another. He spread
8LUKE 8
56
the Good News about God’s kingdom.
The twelve apostles were with him.
2 Also, some women were with him.
They had been cured from evil spirits
and various illnesses. These women
were Mary, also called Magdalene, from
whom seven demons had gone out;
3 Joanna, whose husband Chusa was
Herod’s administrator; Susanna; and
many other women. They provided
ﬁnancial support for Jesus and his
disciples.
4 When a large crowd had gathered and
people had come to Jesus from every
city, he used this story as an illustra on:
5 "A farmer went to plant his seeds.
Some seeds were planted along the
road, were trampled, and were devoured
by birds.
6 Others were planted on rocky soil.
When the plants came up, they withered
because they had no moisture.LUKE 8
57
7 Others were planted among
thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up
with them and choked them.
8 Others were planted on good ground.
When they came up, they produced a
hundred mes as much as was planted."
A er he had said this, he called out, "Let
the person who has ears listen!"
9 His disciples asked him what this story
meant.
10 Jesus answered, "Knowledge about
the mysteries of the kingdom of God has
been given directly to you. But it is given
to others in stories. When they look,
they don’t see, and when they hear, they
don’t understand.
11 "This is what the story illustrates: The
seed is God’s word.
12 Some people are like seeds that were
planted along the road. They hear the
word, but then the devil comes. He takesLUKE 8
58
the word away from them so that they
don’t believe and become saved.
13 Some people are like seeds on rocky
soil. They welcome the word with joy
whenever they hear it, but they don’t
develop any roots. They believe for a
while, but when their faith is tested,
they abandon it.
14 The seeds that were planted among
thornbushes are people who hear the
word, but as life goes on the worries,
riches, and pleasures of life choke them.
So they don’t produce anything good.
15 The seeds that were planted on good
ground are people who also hear the
word. But they keep it in their good and
honest hearts and produce what is good
despite what life may bring.
16 "No one lights a lamp and hides it
under a bowl or puts it under a bed.
Instead, everyone who lights a lamp putsLUKE 8
59
it on a lamp stand so that those who
come in will see the light.
17 There is nothing hidden that will not
be revealed. There is nothing kept secret
that will not come to light.
18 "So pay a en on to how you listen!
Those who understand these mysteries
will be given more knowledge. However,
some people don’t understand these
mysteries. Even what they think they
understand will be taken away from
them."
19 His mother and his brothers came
to see him. But they couldn’t meet with
him because of the crowd.
20 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother
and your brothers are standing outside.
They want to see you."
21 He answered them, "My mother and
my brothers are those who hear and do
what God’s word says."LUKE 8
60
22 One day Jesus and his disciples got
into a boat. He said to them, "Let’s cross
to the other side of the lake." So they
started out.
23 As they were sailing along, Jesus fell
asleep. A violent storm came across the
lake. The boat was taking on water, and
they were in danger.
24 They went to him, woke him up, and
said, "Master! Master! We’re going to
die!" Then he got up and ordered the
wind and the waves to stop. The wind
stopped, and the sea became calm.
25 He asked them, "Where is your
faith?" Frightened and amazed, they
asked each other, "Who is this man? He
gives orders to the wind and the water,
and they obey him!"
26 They landed in the region of the
Gerasenes across from Galilee.
27 When Jesus stepped out on the
shore, a certain man from the city metLUKE 8
61
him. The man was possessed by demons
and had not worn clothes for a long
me. He would not stay in a house but
lived in the tombs.
28 When he saw Jesus, he shouted, fell
in front of him, and said in a loud voice,
"Why are you bothering me, Jesus, Son
of the Most High God? I beg you not to
torture me!"
29 Jesus ordered the evil spirit to come
out of the man. (The evil spirit had
controlled the man for a long me.
People had kept him under guard. He
was chained hand and foot. But he
would break the chains. Then the demon
would force him to go into the desert.)
30 Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?" He answered, "Legion [Six
Thousand]." (Many demons had entered
him.)
31 The demons begged Jesus not to
order them to go into the bo omless pit.LUKE 8
62
32 A large herd of pigs was feeding on
a mountainside. The demons begged
Jesus to let them enter those pigs. So he
let them do this.
33 The demons came out of the man
and went into the pigs. Then the herd
rushed down the cliﬀ into the lake and
drowned.
34 When those who had taken care of
the pigs saw what had happened, they
ran away. They reported everything in
the city and countryside.
35 The people went to see what had
happened. They came to Jesus and
found the man from whom the demons
had gone out. Dressed and in his right
mind, he was si ng at Jesus’ feet. The
people were frightened.
36 Those who had seen this told the
people how Jesus had restored the
demon–possessed man to health.LUKE 8
63
37 Then all the people from the
surrounding region of the Gerasenes
asked Jesus to leave because they were
terriﬁed. Jesus got into a boat and
started back.
38 The man from whom the demons
had gone out begged him, "Let me go
with you." But Jesus sent the man away
and told him,
39 "Go home to your family, and tell
them how much God has done for you."
So the man le . He went through the
whole city and told people how much
Jesus had done for him.
40 When Jesus came back, a crowd
welcomed him. Everyone was expec ng
him.
41 A man named Jairus, a synagogue
leader, arrived and quickly bowed down
in front of Jesus. He begged Jesus to
come to his home.LUKE 8
64
42 His only daughter, who was about
twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus
went, the people were crowding around
him.
43 A woman who had been suﬀering
from chronic bleeding for twelve years
was in the crowd. No one could cure her.
44 She came up behind Jesus, touched
the edge of his clothes, and her bleeding
stopped at once.
45 Jesus asked, "Who touched me?"
A er everyone denied touching him,
Peter said, "Teacher, the people are
crowding you and pressing against you."
46 Jesus said, "Someone touched me. I
know power has gone out of me."
47 The woman saw that she couldn’t
hide. Trembling, she quickly bowed in
front of him. There, in front of all the
people, she told why she touched him
and how she was cured at once.LUKE 8
65
48 Jesus told her, "Daughter, your faith
has made you well. Go in peace!"
49 While Jesus was s ll speaking to her,
someone came from the synagogue
leader’s home. He said, "Your daughter
is dead. Don’t bother the teacher
anymore."
50 When Jesus heard this, he told the
synagogue leader, "Don’t be afraid! Just
believe, and she will get well."
51 Jesus went into the house. He
allowed no one to go with him except
Peter, John, James, and the child’s
parents.
52 Everyone was crying and showing
how sad they were. Jesus said, "Don’t
cry! She’s not dead. She’s just sleeping."
53 They laughed at him because they
knew she was dead.
54 But Jesus took her hand and called
out, "Child, get up!"LUKE 8 – 9
66
55 She came back to life and got up at
once. He ordered her parents to give her
something to eat.
56 They were amazed. Jesus ordered
them not to tell anyone what had
happened.
1 Jesus called the twelve apostles
together and gave them power and
authority over every demon and power
and authority to cure diseases.
2 He sent them to spread the message
about the kingdom of God and to cure
the sick.
3 He told them, "Don’t take anything
along on the trip. Don’t take a walking
s ck, traveling bag, any food, money, or
a change of clothes.
4 When you go into a home, stay there
un l you’re ready to leave.
5 If people don’t welcome you, leave
that city, and shake its dust oﬀ your feet
as a warning to them."
9LUKE 9
67
6 The apostles went from village to
village, told the Good News, and cured
the sick everywhere.
7 Herod the ruler heard about
everything that was happening. He
didn’t know what to make of it. Some
people were saying that John had come
back to life.
8 Others said that Elijah had appeared,
and s ll others said that one of the
prophets from long ago had come back
to life.
9 Herod said, "I had John’s head cut oﬀ.
Who is this person I’m hearing so much
about?" So Herod wanted to see Jesus.
10 The apostles came back and told
Jesus everything they had done. He took
them with him to a city called Bethsaida
so that they could be alone.
11 But the crowds found out about this
and followed him. He welcomed them,LUKE 9
68
talked to them about the kingdom of
God, and cured those who were sick.
12 Toward the end of the day, the twelve
apostles came to him. They said to him,
"Send the crowd to the closest villages
and farms so that they can ﬁnd some
food and a place to stay. No one lives
around here."
13 Jesus replied, "You give them
something to eat." They said to him, "We
have ﬁve loaves of bread and two ﬁsh.
Unless we go to buy food for all these
people, that’s all we have."
14 (There were about ﬁve thousand
men.) Then he told his disciples, "Have
them sit in groups of about ﬁ y."
15 So they did this.
16 Then he took the ﬁve loaves and
the two ﬁsh, looked up to heaven,
and blessed the food. He broke the
loaves apart and kept giving them to the
disciples to give to the crowd.LUKE 9
69
17 All of them ate as much as they
wanted. When they picked up the
le over pieces, they ﬁlled twelve
baskets.
18 Once when Jesus was praying
privately and his disciples were with him,
he asked them, "Who do people say I
am?"
19 They answered, "Some say you are
John the Bap zer, others Elijah, and s ll
others say that one of the prophets from
long ago has come back to life."
20 He asked them, "But who do you say
I am?" Peter answered, "You are the
Messiah, whom God has sent."
21 He ordered them not to tell this to
anyone.
22 Jesus said that the Son of Man would
have to suﬀer a lot. He would be rejected
by the leaders, the chief priests, and the
scribes. He would be killed, but on the
third day he would come back to life.LUKE 9
70
23 He said to all of them, "Those who
want to come with me must say no
to the things they want, pick up their
crosses every day, and follow me.
24 Those who want to save their lives
will lose them. But those who lose their
lives for me will save them.
25 What good does it do for people to
win the whole world but lose their lives
by destroying them?
26 If people are ashamed of me and
what I say, the Son of Man will be
ashamed of those people when he
comes in the glory that he shares with
the Father and the holy angels.
27 "I can guarantee this truth: Some
people who are standing here will not
die un l they see the kingdom of God."
28 About eight days a er he had said
this, Jesus took Peter, John, and James
with him and went up a mountain to
pray.LUKE 9
71
29 While Jesus was praying, the
appearance of his face changed, and his
clothes became dazzling white.
30 Suddenly, both Moses and Elijah
were talking with him.
31 They appeared in heavenly glory
and were discussing Jesus’ approaching
death and what he was about to fulﬁll in
Jerusalem.
32 Peter and the men with him were
sleeping soundly. When they woke up,
they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men
standing with him.
33 As Moses and Elijah were leaving
him, Peter said to Jesus, "Teacher, it’s
good that we’re here. Let’s put up three
tents––one for you, one for Moses, and
one for Elijah." Peter didn’t know what
he was saying.
34 While he was saying this, a cloud
overshadowed them. They were
frightened as they went into the cloud.LUKE 9
72
35 A voice came out of the cloud and
said, "This is my Son, whom I have
chosen. Listen to him!"
36 A er the voice had spoken, they saw
that Jesus was alone. The disciples said
nothing, and for some me they told no
one about what they had seen.
37 The next day, when they had come
down from the mountain, a large crowd
met Jesus.
38 A man in the crowd shouted,
"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son.
He’s my only child.
39 Whenever a spirit takes control of
him, he shrieks, goes into convulsions,
and foams at the mouth. A er a struggle,
the spirit goes away, leaving the child
worn out.
40 I begged your disciples to force the
spirit out of him, but they couldn’t do
it."LUKE 9
73
41 Jesus answered, "You unbelieving
and corrupt genera on! How long must I
be with you and put up with you? Bring
your son here!"
42 While he was coming to Jesus, the
demon knocked the boy to the ground
and threw him into convulsions. Jesus
ordered the evil spirit to leave. He cured
the boy and gave him back to his father.
43 Everyone was amazed to see God’s
wonderful power. Everyone was amazed
at all the things that Jesus was doing. So
he said to his disciples,
44 "Listen carefully to what I say. The
Son of Man will be betrayed and handed
over to people."
45 They didn’t know what he meant.
The meaning was hidden from them so
that they didn’t understand it. Besides,
they were afraid to ask him about what
he had said.LUKE 9
74
46 A discussion started among them
about who would be the greatest.
47 Jesus knew what they were thinking.
So he took a li le child and had him
stand beside him.
48 Then he said to them, "Whoever
welcomes this li le child in my name
welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me
welcomes the one who sent me. The
one who is least among all of you is the
one who is greatest."
49 John replied, "Master, we saw
someone forcing demons out of a person
by using the power and authority of your
name. We tried to stop him because he
was not one of us."
50 Jesus said to him, "Don’t stop him!
Whoever isn’t against you is for you."
51 The me was coming closer for
Jesus to be taken to heaven. So he was
determined to go to Jerusalem.LUKE 9
75
52 He sent messengers ahead of him.
They went into a Samaritan village to
arrange a place for him to stay.
53 But the people didn’t welcome him,
because he was on his way to Jerusalem.
54 James and John, his disciples, saw
this. They asked, "Lord, do you want us
to call down ﬁre from heaven to burn
them up?"
55 But he turned and corrected them.
56 So they went to another village.
57 As they were walking along the road,
a man said to Jesus, "I’ll follow you
wherever you go."
58 Jesus told him, "Foxes have holes,
and birds have nests, but the Son of Man
has nowhere to sleep."
59 He told another man, "Follow me!"
But the man said, "Sir, ﬁrst let me go to
bury my father."
60 But Jesus told him, "Let the dead
bury their own dead. You must goLUKE 9 – 10
76
everywhere and tell about the kingdom
of God."
61 Another said, "I’ll follow you, sir, but
ﬁrst let me tell my family goodbye."
62 Jesus said to him, "Whoever starts
to plow and looks back is not ﬁt for the
kingdom of God."
1 A er this, the Lord appointed 70
other disciples to go ahead of him
to every city and place that he intended
to go. They were to travel in pairs.
2 He told them, "The harvest is large,
but the workers are few. So ask the Lord
who gives this harvest to send workers
to harvest his crops.
3 Go! I’m sending you out like lambs
among wolves.
4 Don’t carry a wallet, a traveling bag, or
sandals, and don’t stop to greet anyone
on the way.
10LUKE 10
77
5 Whenever you go into a house, greet
the family right away with the words,
‘May there be peace in this house.’
6 If a peaceful person lives there, your
gree ng will be accepted. But if that’s
not the case, your gree ng will be
rejected.
7 Stay with the family that accepts you.
Eat and drink whatever they oﬀer you.
A er all, the worker deserves his pay.
Do not move around from one house to
another.
8 Whenever you go into a city and the
people welcome you, eat whatever they
serve you.
9 Heal the sick that are there, and tell
the people, ‘The kingdom of God is near
you!’
10 "But whenever you go into a city
and people don’t welcome you, leave.
Announce in its streets,LUKE 10
78
11 ’We are wiping your city’s dust from
our feet in protest against you! But
realize that the kingdom of God is near
you!’
12 I can guarantee that judgment day
will be easier for Sodom than for that
city.
13 "How horrible it will be for you,
Chorazin! How horrible it will be for you,
Bethsaida! If the miracles worked in
your ci es had been worked in Tyre and
Sidon, they would have changed the way
they thought and acted. Long ago they
would have worn sackcloth and sat in
ashes.
14 Judgment day will be be er for Tyre
and Sidon than for you.
15 And you, Capernaum, will you be
li ed to heaven? No, you will go to hell!
16 "The person who hears you hears
me, and the person who rejects youLUKE 10
79
rejects me. The person who rejects me
rejects the one who sent me."
17 The 70 disciples came back very
happy. They said, "Lord, even demons
obey us when we use the power and
authority of your name!"
18 Jesus said to them, "I watched Satan
fall from heaven like lightning.
19 I have given you the authority to
trample snakes and scorpions and to
destroy the enemy’s power. Nothing will
hurt you.
20 However, don’t be happy that evil
spirits obey you. Be happy that your
names are wri en in heaven."
21 In that hour the Holy Spirit ﬁlled
Jesus with joy. Jesus said, "I praise
you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for hiding these things from wise and
intelligent people and revealing them to
li le children. Yes, Father, this is what
pleased you.LUKE 10
80
22 "My Father has turned everything
over to me. Only the Father knows who
the Son is. And no one knows who the
Father is except the Son and those to
whom the Son is willing to reveal him."
23 He turned to his disciples in private
and said to them, "How blessed you are
to see what you’ve seen.
24 I can guarantee that many prophets
and kings wanted to see and hear what
you’ve seen and heard, but they didn’t."
25 Then an expert in Moses’ Teachings
stood up to test Jesus. He asked,
"Teacher, what must I do to inherit
eternal life?"
26 Jesus answered him, "What is wri en
in Moses’ Teachings? What do you read
there?"
27 He answered, "’Love the Lord your
God with all your heart, with all your
soul, with all your strength, and with allLUKE 10
81
your mind.’ And ‘Love your neighbor as
you love yourself.’"
28 Jesus told him, "You’re right! Do this,
and life will be yours."
29 But the man wanted to jus fy his
ques on. So he asked Jesus, "Who is my
neighbor?"
30 Jesus replied, "A man went from
Jerusalem to Jericho. On the way robbers
stripped him, beat him, and le him for
dead.
31 "By chance, a priest was traveling
along that road. When he saw the man,
he went around him and con nued on
his way.
32 Then a Levite came to that place.
When he saw the man, he, too, went
around him and con nued on his way.
33 "But a Samaritan, as he was traveling
along, came across the man. When the
Samaritan saw him, he felt sorry for the
man,LUKE 10
82
34 went to him, and cleaned and
bandaged his wounds. Then he put him
on his own animal, brought him to an
inn, and took care of him.
35 The next day the Samaritan took out
two silver coins and gave them to the
innkeeper. He told the innkeeper, ‘Take
care of him. If you spend more than that,
I’ll pay you on my return trip.’
36 "Of these three men, who do you
think was a neighbor to the man who
was a acked by robbers?"
37 The expert said, "The one who was
kind enough to help him." Jesus told
him, "Go and imitate his example!"
38 As they were traveling along, Jesus
went into a village. A woman named
Martha welcomed him into her home.
39 She had a sister named Mary. Mary
sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to him
talk.LUKE 10 – 11
83
40 But Martha was upset about all the
work she had to do. So she asked, "Lord,
don’t you care that my sister has le me
to do the work all by myself? Tell her to
help me."
41 The Lord answered her, "Martha,
Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot
of things.
42 There’s only one thing you need.
Mary has made the right choice, and
that one thing will not be taken away
from her."
1 Once Jesus was praying in a
certain place. When he stopped
praying, one of his disciples said to him,
"Lord, teach us to pray as John taught
his disciples."
2 Jesus told them, "When you pray, say
this: Father, let your name be kept holy.
Let your kingdom come.
3 Give us our bread day by day.
11LUKE 11
84
4 Forgive us as we forgive everyone
else. Don’t allow us to be tempted."
5 Jesus said to his disciples, "Suppose
one of you has a friend. Suppose you go
to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, let
me borrow three loaves of bread.
6 A friend of mine on a trip has dropped
in on me, and I don’t have anything to
serve him.’
7 Your friend might answer you from
inside his house, ‘Don’t bother me! The
door is already locked, and my children
are in bed. I can’t get up to give you
anything.’
8 I can guarantee that although he
doesn’t want to get up to give you
anything, he will get up and give you
whatever you need because he is your
friend and because you were so bold.
9 "So I tell you to ask, and you will
receive. Search, and you will ﬁnd. Knock,
and the door will be opened for you.LUKE 11
85
10 Everyone who asks will receive. The
one who searches will ﬁnd, and for the
person who knocks, the door will be
opened.
11 "If your child asks you, his father,
for a ﬁsh, would you give him a snake
instead?
12 Or if your child asks you for an egg,
would you give him a scorpion?
13 Even though you’re evil, you know
how to give good gi s to your children.
So how much more will your Father in
heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him?"
14 Jesus was forcing a demon out of a
man. The demon had made the man
unable to talk. When the demon had
gone out, the man began to talk. The
people were amazed.
15 But some of them said, "He can force
demons out of people only with the help
of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons."LUKE 11
86
16 Others wanted to test Jesus and
demanded that he show them some
miraculous sign from heaven.
17 Since Jesus knew what they were
thinking, he said to them, "Every
kingdom divided against itself is ruined.
A house divided against itself falls.
18 Now, if Satan is divided against
himself, how can his kingdom last? I say
this because you say Beelzebul helps me
force demons out of people.
19 If I force demons out with the help
of Beelzebul, who helps your followers
force them out? That’s why they will be
your judges.
20 But if I force out demons with the
help of God’s power, then the kingdom
of God has come to you.
21 "When a strong man, fully armed,
guards his own mansion, his property is
safe.LUKE 11
87
22 But a stronger man than he may
a ack him and defeat him. Then the
stronger man will take away all the
weapons in which the strong man
trusted and will divide the loot.
23 "Whoever isn’t with me is against
me. Whoever doesn’t gather with me
sca ers.
24 "When an evil spirit comes out of
a person, it goes through dry places
looking for a place to rest. But it doesn’t
ﬁnd any. Then it says, ‘I’ll go back to the
home I le .’
25 When it comes, it ﬁnds the house
swept clean and in order.
26 Then the spirit goes and brings along
seven other spirits more evil than itself.
They enter and take up permanent
residence there. In the end the condi on
of that person is worse than it was
before."LUKE 11
88
27 While Jesus was speaking, a woman
in the crowd shouted, "How blessed is
the mother who gave birth to you and
the breasts that nursed you."
28 Jesus replied, "Rather, how blessed
are those who hear and obey God’s
word."
29 As the people were gathering around
him, Jesus said, "The people living today
are evil. They look for a miraculous sign.
But the only sign they will get is the sign
of Jonah.
30 Just as Jonah became a miraculous
sign to the people of Nineveh, so the
Son of Man will be a miraculous sign to
the people living today.
31 The queen from the south will stand
up at the me of judgment with the men
who live today. She will condemn them,
because she came from the ends of the
earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom. ButLUKE 11
89
look, someone greater than Solomon is
here!
32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at
the me of judgment with the people
living today. Since the men of Nineveh
turned to God and changed the way they
thought and acted when Jonah spoke his
message, they will condemn the people
living today. But look, someone greater
than Jonah is here!
33 "No one lights a lamp and hides it or
puts it under a basket. Instead, everyone
who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand
so that those who come in will see its
light.
34 "Your eye is the lamp of your body.
When your eye is unclouded, your whole
body is full of light. But when your eye is
evil, your body is full of darkness.
35 So be careful that the light in you
isn’t darkness.LUKE 11
90
36 If your whole body is full of light and
not darkness, it will be as bright as a
lamp shining on you."
37 A er Jesus spoke, a Pharisee invited
him to have lunch at his house. So Jesus
accepted the invita on.
38 The Pharisee was surprised to see
that Jesus didn’t wash before the meal.
39 The Lord said to him, "You Pharisees
clean the outside of cups and dishes. But
inside you are full of greed and evil.
40 You fools! Didn’t the one who made
the outside make the inside too?
41 Give what is inside as a gi to the
poor, and then everything will be clean
for you.
42 "How horrible it will be for you
Pharisees! You give God one–tenth of
your mint, spices, and every garden
herb. But you have ignored jus ce and
the love of God. You should have done
these things without ignoring the others.LUKE 11
91
43 "How horrible it will be for you
Pharisees! You love to sit in the front
seats in the synagogues and to be
greeted in the marketplaces.
44 How horrible it will be for you! You
are like unmarked graves. People walk
on them without knowing what they
are."
45 One of the experts in Moses’
Teachings said to him, "Teacher, when
you talk this way, you insult us too."
46 Jesus said, "How horrible it will be
for you experts in Moses’ Teachings! You
burden people with loads that are hard
to carry. But you won’t li a ﬁnger to
carry any of these loads.
47 "How horrible it will be for you! You
build the monuments for the prophets.
But it was your ancestors who murdered
them.
48 So you are witnesses and approve of
what your ancestors did. They murderedLUKE 11
92
the prophets for whom you build
monuments.
49 That’s why the Wisdom of God said,
‘I will send them prophets and apostles.
They will murder some of those prophets
and apostles and persecute others.’
50 So the people living now will be
charged with the murder of every
prophet since the world was made.
51 This includes the murders from Abel
to Zechariah, who was killed between
the altar and the temple. Yes, I can
guarantee this truth: The people living
today will be held responsible for this.
52 "How horrible it will be for you
experts in Moses’ Teachings! You
have taken away the key that unlocks
knowledge. You haven’t gained entrance
into knowledge yourselves, and you’ve
kept out those who wanted to enter."
53 When Jesus le , the scribes and the
Pharisees held a terrible grudge againstLUKE 11 – 12
93
him. They ques oned him about many
things
54 and watched him closely to trap him
in something he might say.
1 Meanwhile, thousands of
people had gathered. They
were so crowded that they stepped on
each other. Jesus spoke to his disciples
and said, "Watch out for the yeast of
the Pharisees. I’m talking about their
hypocrisy.
2 Nothing has been covered that will
not be exposed. Whatever is secret will
be made known.
3 Whatever you have said in the dark

you have whispered in private rooms will
be shouted from the housetops.

9 But God’s angels will be told that I

13 Someone in the crowd said to him,
"Teacher, tell my brother to give me my
share of the inheritance that our father
le us."
14 Jesus said to him, "Who appointed
me to be your judge or to divide your
inheritance?"
15 He told the people, "Be careful to
guard yourselves from every kind of
greed. Life is not about having a lot of
material possessions."
16 Then he used this illustra on. He
said, "A rich man had land that produced
good crops.LUKE 12
96
17 He thought, ‘What should I do? I
don’t have enough room to store my
crops.’
18 He said, ‘I know what I’ll do. I’ll tear
down my barns and build bigger ones so
that I can store all my grain and goods in
them.
19 Then I’ll say to myself, "You’ve stored
up a lot of good things for years to come.
Take life easy, eat, drink, and enjoy
yourself."’
20 "But God said to him, ‘You fool! I will
demand your life from you tonight! Now
who will get what you’ve accumulated?’
21 That’s how it is when a person has
material riches but is not rich in his
rela onship with God."
22 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "So I
tell you to stop worrying about what you
will eat or wear.
23 Life is more than food, and the body
is more than clothes.LUKE 12

24 Consider the crows. They don’t
plant or harvest. They don’t even have

birds.
25 "Can any of you add an hour to your
life by worrying?
26 If you can’t do a small thing like that,
why worry about other things?
27 Consider how the ﬂowers grow. They
never work or spin yarn for clothes. But
I say that not even Solomon in all his
majesty was dressed like one of these
ﬂowers.
28 That’s the way God clothes the
grass in the ﬁeld. Today it’s alive, and
tomorrow it’s thrown into an incinerator.
So how much more will he clothe you

39 "Of course, you realize that if the

57 So why don’t you judge for yourselves
what is right?
58 For instance, when an opponent
brings you to court in front of a ruler, do
your best to se le with him before you
get there. Otherwise, he will drag you in
front of a judge. The judge will hand you
over to an oﬃcer who will throw you
into prison.LUKE 12 – 13
103
59 I can guarantee that you won’t get
out un l you pay every penny of your
ﬁne."
1 At that me some people
reported to Jesus about some
Galileans whom Pilate had executed
while they were sacriﬁcing animals.
2 Jesus replied to them, "Do you think
that this happened to them because
they were more sinful than other people
from Galilee?
3 No! I can guarantee that they weren’t.
But if you don’t turn to God and change
the way you think and act, then you, too,
will all die.
4 What about those 18 people who died
when the tower at Siloam fell on them?
Do you think that they were more sinful
than other people living in Jerusalem?
5 No! I can guarantee that they weren’t.
But if you don’t turn to God and change
13LUKE 13
104
the way you think and act, then you, too,
will all die."
6 Then Jesus used this illustra on:
"A man had a ﬁg tree growing in his
vineyard. He went to look for fruit on the
tree but didn’t ﬁnd any.
7 He said to the gardener, ‘For the last
three years I’ve come to look for ﬁgs on
this ﬁg tree but haven’t found any. Cut it
down! Why should it use up good soil?’
8 "The gardener replied, ‘Sir, let it stand
for one more year. I’ll dig around it and
fer lize it.
9 Maybe next year it’ll have ﬁgs. But if
not, then cut it down.’"
10 Jesus was teaching in a synagogue on
the day of worship.
11 A woman who was possessed by a
spirit was there. The spirit had disabled
her for 18 years. She was hunched over
and couldn’t stand up straight.LUKE 13
105
12 When Jesus saw her, he called her to
come to him and said, "Woman, you are
free from your disability."
13 He placed his hands on her, and
she immediately stood up straight and
praised God.
14 The synagogue leader was irritated
with Jesus for healing on the day of
worship. The leader told the crowd,
"There are six days when work can be
done. So come on one of those days to
be healed. Don’t come on the day of
worship."
15 The Lord said, "You hypocrites! Don’t
each of you free your ox or donkey on
the day of worship? Don’t you then take
it out of its stall to give it some water to
drink?
16 Now, here is a descendant of
Abraham. Satan has kept her in this
condi on for 18 years. Isn’t it right to
free her on the day of worship?"LUKE 13
106
17 As he said this, everyone who
opposed him felt ashamed. But the
en re crowd was happy about the
miraculous things he was doing.
18 Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of
God like? What can I compare it to?
19 It’s like a mustard seed that someone
planted in a garden. It grew and became
a tree, and the birds nested in its
branches."
20 He asked again, "What can I compare
the kingdom of God to?
21 It’s like yeast that a woman mixed
into a large amount of ﬂour un l the
yeast worked its way through all the
dough."
22 Then Jesus traveled and taught in
one city and village a er another on his
way to Jerusalem.
23 Someone asked him, "Sir, are only
a few people going to be saved?" He
answered,LUKE 13
107
24 "Try hard to enter through the
narrow door. I can guarantee that many
will try to enter, but they won’t succeed.
25 A er the homeowner gets up and
closes the door, it’s too late. You can
stand outside, knock at the door, and
say, ‘Sir, open the door for us!’ But he
will answer you, ‘I don’t know who you
are.’
26 Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank
with you, and you taught in our streets.’
27 But he will tell you, ‘I don’t know
who you are. Get away from me, all you
evil people.’
28 Then you will cry and be in extreme
pain. That’s what you’ll do when you
see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets. They’ll be in the kingdom of
God, but you’ll be thrown out.
29 People will come from all over the
world and will eat in the kingdom of
God.LUKE 13
108
30 Some who are last will be ﬁrst, and
some who are ﬁrst will be last."
31 At that me some Pharisees
told Jesus, "Get out of here, and go
somewhere else! Herod wants to kill
you."
32 Jesus said to them, "Tell that fox that
I will force demons out of people and
heal people today and tomorrow. I will
ﬁnish my work on the third day.
33 But I must be on my way today,
tomorrow, and the next day. It’s not
possible for a prophet to die outside
Jerusalem.
34 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the
prophets and stone to death those sent
to you! How o en I wanted to gather
your children together the way a hen
gathers her chicks under her wings! But
you were not willing!
35 Your house will be abandoned. I can
guarantee that you will not see me againLUKE 14
109
un l you say, ‘Blessed is the one who
comes in the name of the Lord!’"
1 On a day of worship Jesus went
to eat at the home of a prominent
Pharisee. The guests were watching
Jesus very closely.
2 A man whose body was swollen with
ﬂuid was there.
3 Jesus reacted by asking the Pharisees
and the experts in Moses’ Teachings, "Is
it right to heal on the day of worship or
not?"
4 But they didn’t say a thing. So Jesus
took hold of the man, healed him, and
sent him away.
5 Jesus asked them, "If your son or your
ox falls into a well on a day of worship,
wouldn’t you pull him out immediately?"
6 They couldn’t argue with him about
this.
7 Then Jesus no ced how the guests
always chose the places of honor. So he
14LUKE 14
110
used this illustra on when he spoke to
them:
8 "When someone invites you to a
wedding, don’t take the place of honor.
Maybe someone more important than
you was invited.
9 Then your host would say to you, ‘Give
this person your place.’ Embarrassed,
you would have to take the place of least
honor.
10 So when you’re invited, take the
place of least honor. Then, when your
host comes, he will tell you, ‘Friend,
move to a more honorable place.’ Then
all the other guests will see how you are
honored.
11 Those who honor themselves will
be humbled, but people who humble
themselves will be honored."
12 Then he told the man who had
invited him, "When you invite people for
lunch or dinner, don’t invite only yourLUKE 14
111
friends, family, other rela ves, or rich
neighbors. Otherwise, they will return
the favor.
13 Instead, when you give a banquet,
invite the poor, the handicapped, the
lame, and the blind.
14 Then you will be blessed because
they don’t have any way to pay you back.
You will be paid back when those who
have God’s approval come back to life."
15 One of those ea ng with him heard
this. So he said to Jesus, "The person
who will be at the banquet in the
kingdom of God is blessed."
16 Jesus said to him, "A man gave a
large banquet and invited many people.
17 When it was me for the banquet, he
sent his servant to tell those who were
invited, ‘Come! Everything is ready now.’
18 "Everyone asked to be excused. The
ﬁrst said to him, ‘I bought a ﬁeld, and I
need to see it. Please excuse me.’LUKE 14
112
19 Another said, ‘I bought ﬁve pairs of
oxen, and I’m on my way to see how well
they plow. Please excuse me.’
20 S ll another said, ‘I recently got
married, and that’s why I can’t come.’
21 "The servant went back to report this
to his master. Then the master of the
house became angry. He told his servant,
‘Run to every street and alley in the city!
Bring back the poor, the handicapped,
the blind, and the lame.’
22 "The servant said, ‘Sir, what you’ve
ordered has been done. But there is s ll
room for more people.’
23 "Then the master told his servant,
‘Go to the roads and paths! Urge the
people to come to my house. I want it to
be full.
24 I can guarantee that none of those
invited earlier will taste any food at my
banquet.’"LUKE 14
113
25 Large crowds were traveling with
Jesus. He turned to them and said,
26 "If people come to me and are not
ready to abandon their fathers, mothers,
wives, children, brothers, and sisters, as
well as their own lives, they cannot be
my disciples.
27 So those who do not carry their
crosses and follow me cannot be my
disciples.
28 "Suppose you want to build a tower.
You would ﬁrst sit down and ﬁgure out
what it costs. Then you would see if you
have enough money to ﬁnish it.
29 Otherwise, if you lay a founda on
and can’t ﬁnish the building, everyone
who watches will make fun of you.
30 They’ll say, ‘This person started to
build but couldn’t ﬁnish the job.’
31 "Or suppose a king is going to war
against another king. He would ﬁrst sit
down and think things through. Can heLUKE 14 – 15
114
and his 10,000 soldiers ﬁght against a
king with 20,000 soldiers?
32 If he can’t, he’ll send ambassadors to
ask for terms of peace while the other
king is s ll far away.
33 In the same way, none of you can
be my disciples unless you give up
everything.
34 "Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste,
how will you restore its ﬂavor?
35 It’s not any good for the ground or for
the manure pile. People throw it away.
"Let the person who has ears listen!"
1 All the tax collectors and sinners
came to listen to Jesus.
2 But the Pharisees and the scribes
complained, "This man welcomes
sinners and eats with them."
3 Jesus spoke to them using this
illustra on:
4 "Suppose a man has 100 sheep and
loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the
15LUKE 15
115
99 sheep grazing in the pasture and look
for the lost sheep un l he ﬁnds it?
5 When he ﬁnds it, he’s happy. He puts
that sheep on his shoulders and
6 goes home. Then he calls his friends
and neighbors together and says to
them, ‘Let’s celebrate! I’ve found my lost
sheep!’
7 I can guarantee that there will be
more happiness in heaven over one
person who turns to God and changes
the way he thinks and acts than over 99
people who already have turned to God
and have his approval."
8 "Suppose a woman has ten coins and
loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp,
sweep the house, and look for the coin
carefully un l she ﬁnds it?
9 When she ﬁnds it, she calls her friends
and neighbors together and says, ‘Let’s
celebrate! I’ve found the coin that I lost.’LUKE 15
116
10 So I can guarantee that God’s angels
are happy about one person who turns
to God and changes the way he thinks
and acts."
11 Then Jesus said, "A man had two
sons.
12 The younger son said to his father,
‘Father, give me my share of the
property.’ So the father divided his
property between his two sons.
13 "A er a few days, the younger son
gathered his possessions and le for
a country far away from home. There
he wasted everything he had on a wild
lifestyle.
14 He had nothing le when a severe
famine spread throughout that country.
He had nothing to live on.
15 So he got a job from someone in that
country and was sent to feed pigs in the
ﬁelds.LUKE 15
117
16 No one in the country would give
him any food, and he was so hungry that
he would have eaten what the pigs were
ea ng.
17 "Finally, he came to his senses. He
said, ‘How many of my father’s hired
men have more food than they can eat,
while I’m starving to death here?
18 I’ll go at once to my father, and I’ll
say to him, "Father, I’ve sinned against
heaven and you.
19 I don’t deserve to be called your son
anymore. Make me one of your hired
men."’
20 "So he went at once to his father.
While he was s ll at a distance, his father
saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran
to his son, put his arms around him, and
kissed him.
21 Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I’ve
sinned against heaven and you. I don’t
deserve to be called your son anymore.’LUKE 15
118
22 "The father said to his servants,
‘Hurry! Bring out the best robe, and put
it on him. Put a ring on his ﬁnger and
sandals on his feet.
23 Bring the fa ened calf, kill it, and let’s
celebrate with a feast.
24 My son was dead and has come back
to life. He was lost but has been found.’
Then they began to celebrate.
25 "His older son was in the ﬁeld. As he
was coming back to the house, he heard
music and dancing.
26 He called to one of the servants and
asked what was happening.
27 "The servant told him, ‘Your brother
has come home. So your father has
killed the fa ened calf to celebrate your
brother’s safe return.’
28 "Then the older son became angry
and wouldn’t go into the house. His
father came out and begged him to
come in.LUKE 15 – 16
119
29 But he answered his father, ‘All these
years I’ve worked like a slave for you. I’ve
never disobeyed one of your commands.
Yet, you’ve never given me so much as
a li le goat for a celebra on with my
friends.
30 But this son of yours spent your
money on pros tutes, and when he
came home, you killed the fa ened calf
for him.’
31 "His father said to him, ‘My child,
you’re always with me. Everything I have
is yours.
32 But we have something to celebrate,
something to be happy about. This
brother of yours was dead but has come
back to life. He was lost but has been
found.’"
1 Then Jesus said to his disciples,
"A rich man had a business
manager. The manager was accused of
was ng the rich man’s property.
16LUKE 16
120
2 So the rich man called for his manager
and said to him, ‘What’s this I hear
about you? Let me examine your books.
It’s obvious that you can’t manage my
property any longer.’
3 "The manager thought, ‘What should
I do? My master is taking my job away
from me. I’m not strong enough to dig,
and I’m ashamed to beg.
4 I know what I’ll do so that people will
welcome me into their homes when I’ve
lost my job.’
5 "So the manager called for each one of
his master’s debtors. He said to the ﬁrst,
‘How much do you owe my master?’
6 "The debtor replied, ‘Eight hundred
gallons of olive oil.’ "The manager told
him, ‘Take my master’s ledger. Quick! Sit
down, and write "four hundred!"’
7 "Then he asked another debtor, ‘How
much do you owe?’ "The debtor replied,
‘A thousand bushels of wheat.’ "TheLUKE 16
121
manager told him, ‘Take the ledger, and
write "eight hundred!"’
8 "The master praised the dishonest
manager for being so clever. Worldly
people are more clever than spiritually–
minded people when it comes to dealing
with others."
9 Jesus con nued, "I’m telling you
that although wealth is o en used in
dishonest ways, you should use it to
make friends for yourselves. When life
is over, you will be welcomed into an
eternal home.
10 Whoever can be trusted with very
li le can also be trusted with a lot.
Whoever is dishonest with very li le is
dishonest with a lot.
11 Therefore, if you can’t be trusted with
wealth that is o en used dishonestly,
who will trust you with wealth that is
real?LUKE 16
122
12 If you can’t be trusted with someone
else’s wealth, who will give you your
own?
13 "A servant cannot serve two masters.
He will hate the ﬁrst master and love
the second, or he will be devoted to the
ﬁrst and despise the second. You cannot
serve God and wealth."
14 The Pharisees, who love money,
heard all this and were making sarcas c
remarks about him.
15 So Jesus said to them, "You try to
jus fy your ac ons in front of people. But
God knows what’s in your hearts. What
is important to humans is disgus ng to
God.
16 "Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets
were in force un l the me of John.
Since that me, people have been telling
the Good News about the kingdom of
God, and everyone is trying to force their
way into it.LUKE 16
123
17 It is easier for the earth and the
heavens to disappear than to drop a
comma from Moses’ Teachings.
18 "Any man who divorces his wife to
marry another woman is commi ng
adultery. The man who marries a woman
divorced in this way is commi ng
adultery.
19 "There was a rich man who wore
expensive clothes. Every day was like a
party to him.
20 There was also a beggar named
Lazarus who was regularly brought to
the gate of the rich man’s house.
21 Lazarus would have eaten any scraps
that fell from the rich man’s table.
Lazarus was covered with sores, and
dogs would lick them.
22 "One day the beggar died, and the
angels carried him to be with Abraham.
The rich man also died and was buried.LUKE 16
124
23 He went to hell, where he was
constantly tortured. As he looked up,
in the distance he saw Abraham and
Lazarus.
24 He yelled, ‘Father Abraham! Have
mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the
p of his ﬁnger in water to cool oﬀ my
tongue. I am suﬀering in this ﬁre.’
25 "Abraham replied, ‘Remember, my
child, that you had a life ﬁlled with good
mes, while Lazarus’ life was ﬁlled with
misery. Now he has peace here, while
you suﬀer.
26 Besides, a wide area separates
us. People couldn’t cross it in either
direc on even if they wanted to.’
27 "The rich man responded, ‘Then I ask
you, Father, to send Lazarus back to my
father’s home.
28 I have ﬁve brothers. He can warn
them so that they won’t end up in this
place of torture.’LUKE 16 – 17
125
29 "Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses’
Teachings and the Prophets. Your
brothers should listen to them!’
30 "The rich man replied, ‘No, Father
Abraham! If someone comes back to
them from the dead, they will turn to
God and change the way they think and
act.’
31 "Abraham answered him, ‘If they
won’t listen to Moses’ Teachings and the
Prophets, they won’t be persuaded even
if someone comes back to life.’"
1 Jesus told his disciples,
"Situa ons that cause people to
lose their faith are certain to arise. But
how horrible it will be for the person
who causes someone to lose his faith!
2 It would be best for that person to be
thrown into the sea with a large stone
hung around his neck than for him to
cause one of these li le ones to lose his
faith.
17LUKE 17
126
3 So watch yourselves! "If a believer
sins, correct him. If he changes the way
he thinks and acts, forgive him.
4 Even if he wrongs you seven mes in
one day and comes back to you seven
mes and says that he is sorry, forgive
him."
5 Then the apostles said to the Lord,
"Give us more faith."
6 The Lord said, "If you have faith the
size of a mustard seed, you could say to
this mulberry tree, ‘Pull yourself up by
the roots, and plant yourself in the sea!’
and it would obey you.
7 "Suppose someone has a servant who
is plowing ﬁelds or watching sheep. Does
he tell his servant when he comes from
the ﬁeld, ‘Have something to eat’?
8 No. Instead, he tells his servant, ‘Get
dinner ready for me! A er you serve me
my dinner, you can eat yours.’LUKE 17
127
9 He doesn’t thank the servant for
following orders.
10 That’s the way it is with you. When
you’ve done everything you’re ordered
to do, say, ‘We’re worthless servants.
We’ve only done our duty.’"
11 Jesus traveled along the border
between Samaria and Galilee on his way
to Jerusalem.
12 As he went into a village, ten men
with a skin disease met him. They stood
at a distance
13 and shouted, "Jesus, Teacher, have
mercy on us!"
14 When he saw them, he told them,
"Show yourselves to the priests." As they
went, they were made clean.
15 When one of them saw that he was
healed, he turned back and praised God
in a loud voice.LUKE 17
128
16 He quickly bowed at Jesus’ feet
and thanked him. (The man was a
Samaritan.)
17 Jesus asked, "Weren’t ten men made
clean? Where are the other nine?
18 Only this foreigner came back to
praise God."
19 Jesus told the man, "Get up, and go
home! Your faith has made you well."
20 The Pharisees asked Jesus when
the kingdom of God would come. He
answered them, "People can’t observe
the coming of the kingdom of God.
21 They can’t say, ‘Here it is!’ or ‘There
it is!’ You see, the kingdom of God is
within you."
22 Jesus said to his disciples, "The me
will come when you will long to see one
of the days of the Son of Man, but you
will not see it.
23 People will say, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here
he is!’ Don’t run a er those people.LUKE 17
129
24 The day of the Son of Man will be like
lightning that ﬂashes from one end of
the sky to the other.
25 But ﬁrst he must suﬀer a lot and be
rejected by the people of his day.
26 "When the Son of Man comes again,
the situa on will be like the me of
Noah.
27 People were ea ng, drinking, and

went into the ship. Then the ﬂood
destroyed all of them.
28 "The situa on will also be like the
me of Lot. People were ea ng, drinking,
buying and selling, plan ng and building.
29 But on the day that Lot le Sodom,
ﬁre and sulfur rained from the sky and
destroyed all of them.
30 The day when the Son of Man is
revealed will be like that.
31 "On that day those who are on the

37 They asked him, "Where, Lord?"
Jesus told them, "Vultures will gather
wherever there is a dead body."
1 Jesus used this illustra on with
his disciples to show them that
they need to pray all the me and never
give up.
2 He said, "In a city there was a judge
who didn’t fear God or respect people.
18LUKE 18
131
3 In that city there was also a widow
who kept coming to him and saying,
‘Give me jus ce.’
4 "For a while the judge refused to do
anything. But then he thought, ‘This
widow really annoys me. Although I
don’t fear God or respect people,
5 I’ll have to give her jus ce. Otherwise,
she’ll keep coming to me un l she wears
me out.’"
6 The Lord added, "Pay a en on to
what the dishonest judge thought.
7 Won’t God give his chosen people
jus ce when they cry out to him for help
day and night? Is he slow to help them?
8 I can guarantee that he will give them
jus ce quickly. But when the Son of Man
comes, will he ﬁnd faith on earth?"
9 Jesus also used this illustra on with
some who were sure that God approved
of them while they looked down on
everyone else.LUKE 18
132
10 He said, "Two men went into the
temple courtyard to pray. One was
a Pharisee, and the other was a tax
collector.
11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed,
‘God, I thank you that I’m not like other
people! I’m not a robber or a dishonest
person. I haven’t commi ed adultery.
I’m not even like this tax collector.
12 I fast twice a week, and I give you a
tenth of my en re income.’
13 "But the tax collector was standing at
a distance. He wouldn’t even look up to
heaven. Instead, he became very upset,
and he said, ‘God, be merciful to me, a
sinner!’
14 "I can guarantee that this tax collector
went home with God’s approval, but the
Pharisee didn’t. Everyone who honors
himself will be humbled, but the person
who humbles himself will be honored."LUKE 18
133
15 Some people brought infants to
Jesus to have him hold them. When the
disciples saw this, they told the people
not to do that.
16 But Jesus called the infants to him
and said, "Don’t stop the children from
coming to me! Children like these are
part of the kingdom of God.
17 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever
doesn’t receive the kingdom of God as a
li le child receives it will never enter it."
18 An oﬃcial asked Jesus, "Good
Teacher, what must I do to inherit
eternal life?"
19 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call
me good? No one is good except God.
20 You know the commandments: Never
commit adultery. Never murder. Never
steal. Never give false tes mony. Honor
your father and your mother."
21 The oﬃcial replied, "I’ve obeyed all
these commandments since I was a boy."LUKE 18
134
22 When Jesus heard this, he said to
him, "You s ll need one thing. Sell
everything you have. Distribute the
money to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then follow me!"
23 When the oﬃcial heard this, he
became sad, because he was very rich.
24 Jesus watched him and said, "How
hard it is for rich people to enter the
kingdom of God!
25 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for
a rich person to enter the kingdom of
God."
26 Those who heard him asked, "Who,
then, can be saved?"
27 Jesus said, "The things that are
impossible for people to do are possible
for God to do."
28 Then Peter said, "We’ve le
everything to follow you."LUKE 18
135
29 Jesus said to them, "I can guarantee
this truth: Anyone who gave up his
home, wife, brothers, parents, or
children because of the kingdom of God
30 will certainly receive many mes as
much in this life and will receive eternal
life in the world to come."
31 Jesus took the twelve apostles aside
and said to them, "We’re going to
Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets
wrote about the Son of Man will come
true.
32 He will be handed over to foreigners.
They will make fun of him, insult him,
spit on him,
33 whip him, and kill him. But on the
third day he will come back to life."
34 But they didn’t understand any of
this. What he said was a mystery to
them, and they didn’t know what he
meant.LUKE 18
136
35 As Jesus came near Jericho, a blind
man was si ng and begging by the road.
36 When he heard the crowd going by,
he tried to ﬁnd out what was happening.
37 The people told him that Jesus from
Nazareth was passing by.
38 Then the blind man shouted, "Jesus,
Son of David, have mercy on me!"
39 The people at the front of the crowd
told the blind man to be quiet. But he
shouted even louder, "Son of David,
have mercy on me!"
40 Jesus stopped and ordered them to
bring the man to him. When the man
came near, Jesus asked him,
41 "What do you want me to do for
you?" The blind man said, "Lord, I want
to see again."
42 Jesus told him, "Receive your sight!
Your faith has made you well."
43 Immediately, he could see again. He
followed Jesus and praised God. All theLUKE 19
137
people saw this, and they, too, praised
God.
1 Jesus was passing through
Jericho.
2 A man named Zacchaeus was there.
He was the director of tax collectors, and
he was rich.
3 He tried to see who Jesus was. But
Zacchaeus was a small man, and he
couldn’t see Jesus because of the crowd.
4 So Zacchaeus ran ahead and climbed
a ﬁg tree to see Jesus, who was coming
that way.
5 When Jesus came to the tree, he
looked up and said, "Zacchaeus, come
down! I must stay at your house today."
6 Zacchaeus came down and was glad
to welcome Jesus into his home.
7 But the people who saw this began to
express disapproval. They said, "He went
to be the guest of a sinner."
19LUKE 19
138
8 Later, at dinner, Zacchaeus stood up
and said to the Lord, "Lord, I’ll give half
of my property to the poor. I’ll pay four
mes as much as I owe to those I have
cheated in any way."
9 Then Jesus said to Zacchaeus, "You
and your family have been saved today.
You’ve shown that you, too, are one of
Abraham’s descendants.
10 Indeed, the Son of Man has come to
seek and to save people who are lost."
11 Jesus was ge ng closer to Jerusalem,
and the people thought that the
kingdom of God would appear suddenly.
While Jesus had the people’s a en on,
he used this illustra on.
12 He said, "A prince went to a distant
country to be appointed king, and then
he returned.
13 Before he le , he called ten of his
servants and gave them ten coins. HeLUKE 19
139
said to his servants, ‘Invest this money
un l I come back.’
14 "The ci zens of his own country
hated him. They sent representa ves to
follow him and say to the person who
was going to appoint him, ‘We don’t
want this man to be our king.’
15 "A er he was appointed king, he
came back. Then he said, ‘Call those
servants to whom I gave money. I want
to know how much each one has made
by inves ng.’
16 "The ﬁrst servant said, ‘Sir, the coin
you gave me has earned ten mes as
much.’
17 "The king said to him, ‘Good job!
You’re a good servant. You proved that
you could be trusted with a li le money.
Take charge of ten ci es.’
18 "The second servant said, ‘The coin
you gave me, sir, has made ﬁve mes as
much.’LUKE 19
140
19 "The king said to this servant, ‘You
take charge of ﬁve ci es.’
20 "Then the other servant said, ‘Sir,
look! Here’s your coin. I’ve kept it in a
cloth for safekeeping because
21 I was afraid of you. You’re a tough
person to get along with. You take what
isn’t yours and harvest grain you haven’t
planted.’
22 "The king said to him, ‘I’ll judge you
by what you’ve said, you evil servant!
You knew that I was a tough person to
get along with. You knew that I take what
isn’t mine and harvest grain I haven’t
planted.
23 Then why didn’t you put my money
in the bank? When I came back, I could
have collected it with interest.’
24 The king told his men, ‘Take his coin
away, and give it to the man who has
ten.’LUKE 19
141
25 "They replied, ‘Sir, he already has ten
coins.’
26 "’I can guarantee that everyone who
has something will be given more. But
everything will be taken away from
those who don’t have much.
27 Bring my enemies, who didn’t want
me to be their king. Kill them in front of
me.’"
28 A er Jesus had given this illustra on,
he con nued on his way to Jerusalem.
29 When he came near Bethphage and
Bethany at the Mount of Olives (as it was
called), Jesus sent two of his disciples
ahead of him.
30 He said to them, "Go into the village
ahead of you. As you enter, you will ﬁnd
a young donkey ed there. No one has
ever sat on it. Un e it, and bring it.
31 If anyone asks you why you are
untying it, say that the Lord needs it."LUKE 19
142
32 The men Jesus sent found it as he
had told them.
33 While they were untying the young
donkey, its owners asked them, "Why
are you untying the donkey?"
34 The disciples answered, "The Lord
needs it."
35 They brought the donkey to Jesus,
put their coats on it, and helped Jesus
onto it.
36 As he was riding along, people spread
their coats on the road.
37 By this me he was coming near the
place where the road went down the
Mount of Olives. Then the whole crowd
of disciples began to praise God for all
the miracles they had seen.
38 They shouted joyfully, "Blessed is the
king who comes in the name of the Lord!
Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest
heaven."LUKE 19
143
39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd
said to Jesus, "Teacher, tell your disciples
to be quiet."
40 Jesus replied, "I can guarantee that if
they are quiet, the stones will cry out."
41 When he came closer and saw the
city, he began to cry.
42 He said, "If you had only known today
what would bring you peace! But now it
is hidden, so you cannot see it.
43 The me will come when enemy
armies will build a wall to surround you
and close you in on every side.
44 They will level you to the ground
and kill your people. One stone will not
be le on top of another, because you
didn’t recognize the me when God
came to help you."
45 Jesus went into the temple courtyard
and began to throw out those who were
selling things there.LUKE 19 – 20
144
46 He said to them, "Scripture says, ‘My
house will be a house of prayer,’ but you
have turned it into a gathering place for
thieves."
47 Jesus taught in the temple courtyard
every day. The chief priests, the scribes,
and the leaders of the people looked for
a way to kill him.
48 But they could not ﬁnd a way to do
it, because all the people were eager to
hear him.
1 One day Jesus was teaching the
people in the temple courtyard
and telling them the Good News. The
chief priests, scribes, and leaders came
up to him.
2 They asked him, "Tell us, what gives
you the right to do these things? Who
told you that you could do this?"
3 Jesus answered them, "I, too, have a
ques on for you. Tell me,
20LUKE 20
4 did John’s right to bap
145
ze come from
heaven or from humans?"
5 They talked about this among
themselves. They said, "If we say, ‘from
heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you
believe him?’
6 But if we say, ‘from humans,’ everyone
will stone us to death. They’re convinced
that John was a prophet."
7 So they answered that they didn’t
know who gave John the right to bap ze.
8 Jesus told them, "Then I won’t tell you
why I have the right to do these things."
9 Then, using this illustra on, Jesus
spoke to the people: "A man planted a
vineyard, leased it to vineyard workers,
and went on a long trip.
10 "At the right me he sent a servant
to the workers to obtain from them a
share of the grapes from the vineyard.
But the workers beat the servant and
sent him back with nothing.LUKE 20
146
11 So he sent a diﬀerent servant.
The workers beat him, treated him
shamefully, and sent him back with
nothing.
12 Then he sent a third servant. But
they injured this one and threw him out
of the vineyard.
13 "Then the owner of the vineyard
said, ‘What should I do? I’ll send my son,
whom I love. They’ll probably respect
him.’
14 "When the workers saw him, they
talked it over among themselves. They
said, ‘This is the heir. Let’s kill him so
that the inheritance will be ours.’
15 So they threw him out of the vineyard
and killed him. "What will the owner of
the vineyard do to them?
16 He will destroy these workers and
give the vineyard to others." Those who
heard him said, "That’s unthinkable!"LUKE 20
147
17 Then Jesus looked straight at them
and asked, "What, then, does this
Scripture verse mean: ‘The stone that
the builders rejected has become the
cornerstone’?
18 Everyone who falls on that stone will
be broken. If that stone falls on anyone,
it will crush that person."
19 The scribes and the chief priests
wanted to arrest him right there,
but they were afraid of the people.
They knew that he had directed this
illustra on at them.
20 So they watched for an opportunity
to send out some spies. The spies were
to act like sincere religious people. They
wanted to catch him saying the wrong
thing so that they could hand him over
to the governor.
21 They asked him, "Teacher, we know
that you’re right in what you say and
teach. Besides, you don’t play favorites.LUKE 20
148
Rather, you teach the way of God
truthfully.
22 Is it right for us to pay taxes to the
emperor or not?"
23 He saw through their scheme, so he
said to them,
24 "Show me a coin. Whose face and
name is this?" They answered, "The
emperor’s."
25 He said to them, "Well, then give the
emperor what belongs to the emperor,
and give God what belongs to God."
26 They couldn’t make him say anything
wrong in front of the people. His answer
surprised them, so they said no more.
27 Some Sadducees, who say that
people will never come back to life,
came to Jesus. They asked him,
28 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, ‘If a
married man dies and has no children,
his brother should marry his widow and
have children for his brother.’LUKE 20
149
29 There were seven brothers. The ﬁrst
got married and died without having
children.
30 Then the second brother married the
widow,
31 and so did the third. In the same way
all seven brothers married the widow,
died, and le no children.
32 Finally, the woman died.
33 Now, when the dead come back to
life, whose wife will she be? The seven
brothers had married her."
34 Jesus said to them, "In this world
people get married.
35 But people who are considered
worthy to come back to life and live in
the next world will neither marry
36 nor die anymore. They are the same
as the angels. They are God’s children
who have come back to life.
37 "Even Moses showed in the passage
about the bush that the dead come backLUKE 20
150
to life. He says that the Lord is the God
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
38 He’s not the God of the dead but of
the living. In God’s sight all people are
living."
39 Some scribes responded, "Teacher,
that was well said."
40 From that me on, no one dared to
ask him another ques on.
41 Jesus said to them, "How can people
say that the Messiah is David’s son?
42 David says in the book of Psalms,
‘The Lord said to my Lord, "Take the
highest posi on in heaven
43 un l I make your enemies your
footstool."’
44 David calls him Lord. So how can he
be his son?"
45 While all the people were listening,
Jesus said to the disciples,
46 "Beware of the scribes! They like to
walk around in long robes and love to beLUKE 20 – 21
151
greeted in the marketplaces, to have the
front seats in the synagogues and the
places of honor at dinners.
47 They rob widows by taking their
houses and then say long prayers
to make themselves look good. The
scribes will receive the most severe
punishment."
1 Looking up, Jesus saw people,
especially the rich, dropping their
gi s into the temple oﬀering box.
2 He no ced a poor widow drop in two
small coins.
3 He said, "I can guarantee this truth:
This poor widow has given more than all
the others.
4 All of these people have given what
they could spare. But she, in her poverty,
has given everything she had to live on."
5 Some of the disciples were talking
about the temple complex. They noted
that it was built with ﬁne stones and
21LUKE 21
152
decorated with beau ful gi s. So Jesus
said,
6 "About these buildings that you
see––the me will come when not one
of these stones will be le on top of
another. Each one will be torn down."
7 The disciples asked him, "Teacher,
when will this happen? What will be the
sign when all this will occur?"
8 Jesus said, "Be careful that you are
not deceived. Many will come using my
name. They will say, ‘I am he!’ and ‘The
me is near.’ Don’t follow them!
9 "When you hear of wars and
revolu ons, don’t be terriﬁed! These
things must happen ﬁrst, but the end
will not come immediately."
10 Then Jesus con nued, "Na on will
ﬁght against na on and kingdom against
kingdom.
11 There will be terrible earthquakes,
famines, and dreadful diseases in variousLUKE 21
153
places. Terrifying sights and miraculous
signs will come from the sky.
12 "Before all these things happen,
people will arrest and persecute you.
They will hand you over to their
synagogues and put you into their
prisons. They will drag you in front of
kings and governors because of my
name.
13 It will be your opportunity to tes fy
to them.
14 So make up your minds not to
worry beforehand how you will defend
yourselves.
15 I will give you words and wisdom
that none of your enemies will be able
to oppose or prove wrong.
16 "Even parents, brothers, rela ves,
and friends will betray you and kill some
of you.
17 Everyone will hate you because you
are commi ed to me.LUKE 21
154
18 But not a hair on your head will be
lost.
19 By your endurance you will save your
life.
20 "When you see armies camped
around Jerusalem, realize that the me
is near for it to be destroyed.
21 Then those of you in Judea should
ﬂee to the mountains. Those of you in
Jerusalem should leave it. Those of you
in the ﬁelds shouldn’t go back into them.
22 This will be a me of vengeance.
Everything that is wri en about it will
come true.
23 "How horrible it will be for women
who are pregnant or who are nursing
babies in those days. Indeed, the land
will suﬀer very hard mes, and its people
will be punished.
24 Swords will cut them down, and
they will be carried oﬀ into all na ons
as prisoners. Na ons will trampleLUKE 21
155
Jerusalem un l the mes allowed for the
na ons to do this are over.
25 "Miraculous signs will occur in the
sun, moon, and stars. The na ons of
the earth will be deeply troubled and
confused because of the roaring and
tossing of the sea.
26 People will faint as they fearfully
wait for what will happen to the world.
Indeed, the powers of the universe will
be shaken.
27 "Then people will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great
glory.
28 "When these things begin to happen,
stand with conﬁdence! The me when
you will be set free is near."
29 Then Jesus used this story as an
illustra on. "Look at the ﬁg tree or any
other tree.LUKE 21
156
30 As soon as leaves grow on them, you
know without being told that summer is
near.
31 In the same way, when you see
these things happen, you know that the
kingdom of God is near.
32 "I can guarantee this truth: This
genera on will not disappear un l all
this takes place.
33 The earth and the heavens will
disappear, but my words will never
disappear.
34 "Make sure that you don’t become
drunk, hung over, and worried about life.
Then that day could suddenly catch you
by surprise
35 like a trap that catches a bird. That
day will surprise all people who live on
the earth.
36 Be alert at all mes. Pray so that you
have the power to escape everythingLUKE 21 – 22
157
that is about to happen and to stand in
front of the Son of Man."
37 During the day Jesus would teach in
the temple courtyard. But at night he
would go to the Mount of Olives (as it
was called) and spend the night there.
38 All of the people would get up
early to hear him speak in the temple
courtyard.
1 The Fes val of Unleavened
Bread, called Passover, was near.
2 The chief priests and the scribes
were looking for some way to kill Jesus.
However, they were afraid of the people.
3 Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot,
one of the twelve apostles.
4 Judas went to the chief priests and
the temple guards and discussed with
them how he could betray Jesus.
5 They were pleased and agreed to give
him some money.
22LUKE 22
158
6 So Judas promised to do it. He kept
looking for an opportunity to betray
Jesus to them when there was no crowd.
7 The day came during the Fes val of
Unleavened Bread when the Passover
lamb had to be killed.
8 Jesus sent Peter and John and told
them, "Go, prepare the Passover lamb
for us to eat."
9 They asked him, "Where do you want
us to prepare it?"
10 He told them, "Go into the city, and
you will meet a man carrying a jug of
water. Follow him into the house he
enters.
11 Tell the owner of the house that the
teacher asks, ‘Where is the room where
I can eat the Passover meal with my
disciples?’
12 He will take you upstairs and show
you a large furnished room. Get things
ready there."LUKE 22
13 The disciples le
159
. They found
everything as Jesus had told them and
prepared the Passover.
14 When it was me to eat the Passover
meal, Jesus and the apostles were at the
table.
15 Jesus said to them, "I’ve had a deep
desire to eat this Passover with you
before I suﬀer.
16 I can guarantee that I won’t eat it
again un l it ﬁnds its fulﬁllment in the
kingdom of God."
17 Then he took a cup and spoke a
prayer of thanksgiving. He said, "Take
this, and share it.
18 I can guarantee that from now on I
won’t drink this wine un l the kingdom
of God comes."
19 Then Jesus took bread and spoke
a prayer of thanksgiving. He broke the
bread, gave it to them, and said, "This isLUKE 22
160
my body, which is given up for you. Do
this to remember me."
20 When supper was over, he did the
same with the cup. He said, "This cup
that is poured out for you is the new
promise made with my blood."
21 "The hand of the one who will betray
me is with me on the table.
22 The Son of Man is going to die the
way it has been planned for him. But
how horrible it will be for that person
who betrays him."
23 So they began to discuss with each
other who could do such a thing.
24 Then a quarrel broke out among the
disciples. They argued about who should
be considered the greatest.
25 Jesus said to them, "The kings of
na ons have power over their people,
and those in authority call themselves
friends of the people.LUKE 22
161
26 But you’re not going to be that way!
Rather, the greatest among you must be
like the youngest, and your leader must
be like a servant.
27 Who’s the greatest, the person who
sits at the table or the servant? Isn’t it
really the person who sits at the table?
But I’m among you as a servant.
28 "You have stood by me in the troubles
that have tested me.
29 So as my Father has given me a
kingdom, I’m giving it to you.
30 You will eat and drink at my table in
my kingdom. You will also sit on thrones
and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
31 Then the Lord said, "Simon, Simon,
listen! Satan has demanded to have
you apostles for himself. He wants
to separate you from me as a farmer
separates wheat from husks.LUKE 22
162
32 But I have prayed for you, Simon,
that your faith will not fail. So when you
recover, strengthen the other disciples."
33 But Peter said to him, "Lord, I’m
ready to go to prison with you and to die
with you."
34 Jesus replied, "Peter, I can guarantee
that the rooster won’t crow tonight un l
you say three mes that you don’t know
me."
35 Then Jesus said to them, "When I
sent you out without a wallet, traveling
bag, or sandals, you didn’t lack anything,
did you?" "Not a thing!" they answered.
36 Then he said to them, "But now, the
person who has a wallet and a traveling
bag should take them along. The person
who doesn’t have a sword should sell his
coat and buy one.
37 I can guarantee that the Scripture
passage which says, ‘He was counted
with criminals,’ must ﬁnd its fulﬁllmentLUKE 22
163
in me. Indeed, whatever is wri en about
me will come true."
38 The disciples said, "Lord, look! Here
are two swords!" Then Jesus said to
them, "That’s enough!"
39 Jesus went out of the city to the
Mount of Olives as he usually did. His
disciples followed him.
40 When he arrived, he said to them,
"Pray that you won’t be tempted."
41 Then he withdrew from them about
a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed,
42 "Father, if it is your will, take this cup
of suﬀering away from me. However,
your will must be done, not mine."
43 Then an angel from heaven appeared
to him and gave him strength.
44 So he prayed very hard in anguish.
His sweat became like drops of blood
falling to the ground.
45 When Jesus ended his prayer, he
got up and went to the disciples. HeLUKE 22
164
found them asleep and overcome with
sadness.
46 He said to them, "Why are you
sleeping? Get up, and pray that you
won’t be tempted."
47 While he was s ll speaking to the
disciples, a crowd arrived. The man
called Judas, one of the twelve apostles,
was leading them. He came close to
Jesus to kiss him.
48 Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you
intend to betray the Son of Man with a
kiss?"
49 The men who were with Jesus saw
what was going to happen. So they asked
him, "Lord, should we use our swords to
ﬁght?"
50 One of the disciples cut oﬀ the right
ear of the chief priest’s servant.
51 But Jesus said, "Stop! That’s enough
of this." Then he touched the servant’s
ear and healed him.LUKE 22
165
52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
temple guards, and leaders who had
come for him, "Have you come out with
swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?
53 I was with you in the temple
courtyard every day and you didn’t try
to arrest me. But this is your me, when
darkness rules."
54 So they arrested Jesus and led him
away to the chief priest’s house. Peter
followed at a distance.
55 Some men had lit a ﬁre in the middle
of the courtyard. As they sat together,
Peter sat among them.
56 A female servant saw him as he sat
facing the glow of the ﬁre. She stared at
him and said, "This man was with Jesus."
57 But Peter denied it by saying, "I don’t
know him, woman."
58 A li le later someone else saw Peter
and said, "You are one of them." But
Peter said, "Not me!"LUKE 22
166
59 About an hour later another person
insisted, "It’s obvious that this man was
with him. He’s a Galilean!"
60 But Peter said, "I don’t know what
you’re talking about!" Just then, while
he was s ll speaking, a rooster crowed.
61 Then the Lord turned and looked
directly at Peter. Peter remembered
what the Lord had said: "Before a rooster
crows today, you will say three mes
that you don’t know me."
62 Then Peter went outside and cried
bi erly.
63 The men who were guarding Jesus
made fun of him as they beat him.
64 They blindfolded him and said to
him, "Tell us who hit you."
65 They also insulted him in many other
ways.
66 In the morning the council of the
people’s leaders, the chief priests and
the scribes, gathered together. TheyLUKE 22 – 23
167
brought Jesus in front of their highest
court and asked him,
67 "Tell us, are you the Messiah?" Jesus
said to them, "If I tell you, you won’t
believe me.
68 And if I ask you, you won’t answer.
69 But from now on, the Son of Man will
be in the highest posi on in heaven."
70 Then all of them said, "So you’re the
Son of God?" Jesus answered them,
"You’re right to say that I am."
71 Then they said, "Why do we need
any more tes mony? We’ve heard him
say it ourselves."
1 Then the en re assembly stood
up and took him to Pilate.
2 They began to accuse Jesus by saying,
"We found that he s rs up trouble
among our people: He keeps them from
paying taxes to the emperor, and he says
that he is Christ, a king."
23LUKE 23
168
3 Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of
the Jews?" "Yes, I am," Jesus answered.
4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the
crowd, "I can’t ﬁnd this man guilty of any
crime."
5 The priests and the crowd became
more forceful. They said, "He s rs up
the people throughout Judea with his
teachings. He started in Galilee and has
come here."
6 When Pilate heard that, he asked if
the man was from Galilee.
7 When Pilate found out that he was, he
sent Jesus to Herod. Herod ruled Galilee
and was in Jerusalem at that me.
8 Herod was very pleased to see Jesus.
For a long me he had wanted to see
him. He had heard about Jesus and
hoped to see him perform some kind of
miracle.
9 Herod asked Jesus many ques ons,
but Jesus wouldn’t answer him.LUKE 23
169
10 Meanwhile, the chief priests and the
scribes stood there and shouted their
accusa ons against Jesus.
11 Herod and his soldiers treated Jesus
with contempt and made fun of him.
They put a colorful robe on him and sent
him back to Pilate.
12 So Herod and Pilate became friends
that day. They had been enemies before
this.
13 Then Pilate called together the chief
priests, the rulers, and the people.
14 He told them, "You brought me this
man as someone who turns the people
against the government. I’ve ques oned
him in front of you and haven’t found
this man guilty of the crimes of which
you accuse him.
15 Neither could Herod. So he sent this
man back to us. This man hasn’t done
anything to deserve the death penalty.LUKE 23
170
16 So I’m going to have him whipped
and set free."
17 (OMITTED TEXT)
18 The whole crowd then shouted,
"Take him away! Free Barabbas for us."
19 (Barabbas had been thrown into
prison for his involvement in a riot
that had taken place in the city and for
murder.)
20 But because Pilate wanted to free
Jesus, he spoke to the people again.
21 They began yelling, "Crucify him!
Crucify him!"
22 A third me Pilate spoke to them. He
asked, "Why? What has he done wrong?
I haven’t found this man deserving of
the death penalty. So I’m going to have
him whipped and set free."
23 But the crowd pressured Pilate. They
shouted that Jesus had to be cruciﬁed,
and they ﬁnally won.LUKE 23
171
24 Pilate decided to give in to their
demand.
25 He freed Barabbas, who had been
put in prison for rio ng and murdering,
because that’s what they wanted. But he
let them do what they wanted to Jesus.
26 As the soldiers led Jesus away, they
grabbed a man named Simon, who was
from the city of Cyrene. Simon was
coming into Jerusalem. They laid the
cross on him and made him carry it
behind Jesus.
27 A large crowd followed Jesus. The
women in the crowd cried and sang
funeral songs for him.
28 Jesus turned to them and said, "You
women of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me!
Rather, cry for yourselves and your
children!
29 The me is coming when people
will say, ‘Blessed are the women whoLUKE 23
172
couldn’t get pregnant, who couldn’t give
birth, and who couldn’t nurse a child.’
30 Then people will say to the
mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills,
‘Cover us!’
31 If people do this to a green tree, what
will happen to a dry one?"
32 Two others, who were criminals,
were led away to be executed with him.
33 When they came to the place called
The Skull, they cruciﬁed him. The
criminals were also cruciﬁed, one on his
right and the other on his le .
34 Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive
them. They don’t know what they’re
doing." Meanwhile, the soldiers divided
his clothes among themselves by
throwing dice.
35 The people stood there watching.
But the rulers were making sarcas c
remarks. They said, "He saved others. IfLUKE 23
173
he’s the Messiah that God has chosen,
let him save himself!"
36 The soldiers also made fun of him.
They would go up to him, oﬀer him some
vinegar,
37 and say, "If you’re the king of the
Jews, save yourself!"
38 A wri en no ce was placed above
him. It said, "This is the king of the Jews."
39 One of the criminals hanging there
insulted Jesus by saying, "So you’re
really the Messiah, are you? Well, save
yourself and us!"
40 But the other criminal scolded him:
"Don’t you fear God at all? Can’t you see
that you’re condemned in the same way
that he is?
41 Our punishment is fair. We’re ge ng
what we deserve. But this man hasn’t
done anything wrong."
42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
when you enter your kingdom."LUKE 23
174
43 Jesus said to him, "I can guarantee
this truth: Today you will be with me in
paradise."
44 Around noon darkness came over
the en re land and lasted un l three in
the a ernoon.
45 The sun had stopped shining. The
curtain in the temple was split in two.
46 Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
"Father, into your hands I entrust my
spirit." A er he said this, he died.
47 When an army oﬃcer saw what had
happened, he praised God and said,
"Certainly, this man was innocent!"
48 Crowds had gathered to see the
sight. But when all of them saw what
had happened, they cried and returned
to the city.
49 All his friends, including the women
who had followed him from Galilee,
stood at a distance and watched
everything.LUKE 23
175
50 There was a good man who had
God’s approval. His name was Joseph.
He was a member of the Jewish council,
51 but he had not agreed with what
they had done. He was from the Jewish
city of Arimathea, and he was wai ng
for the kingdom of God.
52 He went to Pilate and asked for the
body of Jesus.
53 A er he took it down from the cross,
he wrapped it in linen. Then he laid the
body in a tomb cut in rock, a tomb in
which no one had ever been buried.
54 It was Friday, and the day of worship
was just beginning.
55 The women who had come with
Jesus from Galilee followed closely
behind Joseph. They observed the tomb
and how his body was laid in it.
56 Then they went back to the city and
prepared spices and perfumes. But onLUKE 24
176
the day of worship they rested according
to the commandment.
1 Very early on Sunday morning
the women went to the tomb.
They were carrying the spices that they
had prepared.
2 They found that the stone had been
rolled away from the tomb.
3 When they went in, they did not ﬁnd
the body of the Lord Jesus.
4 While they were puzzled about this,
two men in clothes that were as bright
as lightning suddenly stood beside them.
5 The women were terriﬁed and bowed
to the ground. The men asked the
women, "Why are you looking among
the dead for the living one?
6 He’s not here. He has been brought
back to life! Remember what he told you
while he was s ll in Galilee.
7 He said, ‘The Son of Man must
be handed over to sinful people, be
24LUKE 24
177
cruciﬁed, and come back to life on the
third day.’"
8 Then the women remembered what
Jesus had told them.
9 The women le the tomb and went
back to the city. They told everything to
the eleven apostles and all the others.
10 The women were Mary from
Magdala, Joanna, and Mary (the mother
of James). There were also other women
with them. They told the apostles
everything.
11 The apostles thought that the
women’s story didn’t make any sense,
and they didn’t believe them.
12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.
He bent down to look inside and saw
only the strips of linen. Then he went
away, wondering what had happened.
13 On the same day, two of Jesus’
disciples were going to a village calledLUKE 24
178
Emmaus. It was about seven miles from
Jerusalem.
14 They were talking to each other
about everything that had happened.
15 While they were talking, Jesus
approached them and began walking
with them.
16 Although they saw him, they didn’t
recognize him.
17 He asked them, "What are you
discussing?" They stopped and looked
very sad.
18 One of them, Cleopas, replied,
"Are you the only one in Jerusalem
who doesn’t know what has happened
recently?"
19 "What happened?" he asked. They
said to him, "We were discussing what
happened to Jesus from Nazareth. He
was a powerful prophet in what he did
and said in the sight of God and all the
people.LUKE 24
179
20 Our chief priests and rulers had him
condemned to death and cruciﬁed.
21 We were hoping that he was the one
who would free Israel. What’s more, this
is now the third day since everything
happened.
22 Some of the women from our group
startled us. They went to the tomb early
this morning
23 and didn’t ﬁnd his body. They told us
that they had seen angels who said that
he’s alive.
24 Some of our men went to the tomb
and found it empty, as the women had
said, but they didn’t see him."
25 Then Jesus said to them, "How
foolish you are! You’re so slow to believe
everything the prophets said!
26 Didn’t the Messiah have to suﬀer
these things and enter into his glory?"
27 Then he began with Moses’ Teachings
and the Prophets to explain to themLUKE 24
180
what was said about him throughout the
Scriptures.
28 When they came near the village
where they were going, Jesus acted as if
he were going farther.
29 They urged him, "Stay with us! It’s
ge ng late, and the day is almost over."
So he went to stay with them.
30 While he was at the table with them,
he took bread and blessed it. He broke
the bread and gave it to them.
31 Then their eyes were opened, and
they recognized him. But he vanished
from their sight.
32 They said to each other, "Weren’t we
excited when he talked with us on the
road and opened up the meaning of the
Scriptures for us?"
33 That same hour they went back
to Jerusalem. They found the eleven
apostles and those who were with them
gathered together.LUKE 24
181
34 They were saying, "The Lord has
really come back to life and has appeared
to Simon."
35 Then the two disciples told what had
happened on the road and how they
had recognized Jesus when he broke the
bread.
36 While they were talking about what
had happened, Jesus stood among them.
He said to them, "Peace be with you!"
37 They were terriﬁed, and thought
they were seeing a ghost.
38 He asked them, "Why are you afraid?
Why do you have doubts?
39 Look at my hands and feet, and see
that it’s really me. Touch me, and see for
yourselves. Ghosts don’t have ﬂesh and
bones, but you can see that I do."
40 As he said this, he showed them his
hands and feet.
41 The disciples were overcome with joy
and amazement because this seemedLUKE 24
182
too good to be true. Then Jesus asked
them, "Do you have anything to eat?"
42 They gave him a piece of broiled ﬁsh.
43 He took it and ate it while they
watched him.
44 Then he said to them, "These are
the words I spoke to you while I was
s ll with you. I told you that everything
wri en about me in Moses’ Teachings,
the Prophets, and the Psalms had to
come true."
45 Then he opened their minds to
understand the Scriptures.
46 He said to them, "Scripture says that
the Messiah would suﬀer and that he
would come back to life on the third day.
47 Scripture also says that by the
authority of Jesus people would be told
to turn to God and change the way they
think and act so that their sins will be
forgiven. This would be told to peopleLUKE 24
183
from all na ons, beginning in the city of
Jerusalem.
48 You are witnesses to these things.
49 "I’m sending you what my Father
promised. Wait here in the city un l you
receive power from heaven."
50 Then Jesus took them to a place near
Bethany. There he raised his hands and
blessed them.
51 While he was blessing them, he le
them and was taken to heaven.
52 The disciples worshiped him and
were overjoyed as they went back to
Jerusalem.
53 They were always in the temple,
where they praised God.John
1
1 In the beginning the Word already
existed. The Word was with God, and
the Word was God.
2 He was already with God in the
beginning.
3 Everything came into existence
through him. Not one thing that exists
was made without him.
4 He was the source of life, and that life
was the light for humanity.
5 The light shines in the dark, and the
dark has never ex nguished it.
6 God sent a man named John to be his
messenger.
7 John came to declare the truth about
the light so that everyone would become
believers through his message.JOHN 1
2
8 John was not the light, but he came to
declare the truth about the light.
9 The real light, which shines on
everyone, was coming into the world.
10 He was in the world, and the world
came into existence through him. Yet,
the world didn’t recognize him.
11 He went to his own people, and his
own people didn’t accept him.
12 However, he gave the right to
become God’s children to everyone who
believed in him.
13 These people didn’t become God’s
children in a physical way––from a
human impulse or from a husband’s
desire to have a child. They were born
from God.
14 The Word became human and lived
among us. We saw his glory. It was the
glory that the Father shares with his only
Son, a glory full of kindness and truth.JOHN 1
3
15 (John declared the truth about him
when he said loudly, "This is the person
about whom I said, ‘The one who comes
a er me was before me because he
existed before I did.’")
16 Each of us has received one gi a er
another because of all that the Word is.
17 The Teachings were given through
Moses, but kindness and truth came into
existence through Jesus Christ.
18 No one has ever seen God. God’s
only Son, the one who is closest to the
Father’s heart, has made him known.
19 This was John’s answer when the
Jews sent priests and Levites from
Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
20 John didn’t refuse to answer. He told
them clearly, "I’m not the Messiah."
21 They asked him, "Well, are you
Elijah?" John answered, "No, I’m not."
Then they asked, "Are you the prophet?"
John replied, "No."JOHN 1
4
22 So they asked him, "Who are you?
Tell us so that we can take an answer
back to those who sent us. What do you
say about yourself?"
23 John said, "I’m a voice crying out in
the desert, ‘Make the way for the Lord
straight,’ as the prophet Isaiah said."
24 Some of those who had been sent
were Pharisees.
25 They asked John, "Why do you
bap ze if you’re not the Messiah or
Elijah or the prophet?"
26 John answered them, "I bap ze
with water. Someone you don’t know is
standing among you.
27 He’s the one who comes a er me. I
am not worthy to un e his sandal strap."
28 This happened in Bethany on the
east side of the Jordan River, where John
was bap zing.
29 John saw Jesus coming toward him
the next day and said, "Look! This is theJOHN 1
5
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
the world.
30 He is the one I spoke about when I
said, ‘A man who comes a er me was
before me because he existed before I
did.’
31 I didn’t know who he was. However, I
came to bap ze with water to show him
to the people of Israel."
32 John said, "I saw the Spirit come
down as a dove from heaven and stay on
him.
33 I didn’t know who he was. But God,
who sent me to bap ze with water, had
told me, ‘When you see the Spirit come
down and stay on someone, you’ll know
that person is the one who bap zes with
the Holy Spirit.’
34 I have seen this and have declared
that this is the Son of God."
35 The next day John was standing with
two of his disciples.JOHN 1
6
36 John saw Jesus walk by. John said,
"Look! This is the Lamb of God."
37 When the two disciples heard John
say this, they followed Jesus.
38 Jesus turned around and saw them
following him. He asked them, "What
are you looking for?" They said to
him, "Rabbi" (which means "teacher"),
"where are you staying?"
39 Jesus told them, "Come, and you will
see." So they went to see where he was
staying and spent the rest of that day
with him. It was about ten o’clock in the
morning.
40 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was
one of the two disciples who heard John
and followed Jesus.
41 Andrew at once found his brother
Simon and told him, "We have found the
Messiah" (which means "Christ").
42 Andrew brought Simon to Jesus.
Jesus looked at Simon and said, "You areJOHN 1
7
Simon, son of John. Your name will be
Cephas" (which means "Peter").
43 The next day Jesus wanted to go to
Galilee. He found Philip and told him,
"Follow me!"
44 (Philip was from Bethsaida, the
hometown of Andrew and Peter.)
45 Philip found Nathanael and told
him, "We have found the man whom
Moses wrote about in his teachings and
whom the prophets wrote about. He is
Jesus, son of Joseph, from the city of
Nazareth."
46 Nathanael said to Philip, "Can
anything good come from Nazareth?"
Philip told him, "Come and see!"
47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward
him and remarked, "Here is a true
Israelite who is sincere."
48 Nathanael asked Jesus, "How do
you know anything about me?" JesusJOHN 1 – 2
8
answered him, "I saw you under the ﬁg
tree before Philip called you."
49 Nathanael said to Jesus, "Rabbi, you
are the Son of God! You are the king of
Israel!"
50 Jesus replied, "You believe because
I told you that I saw you under the ﬁg
tree. You will see greater things than
that."
51 Jesus said to Nathanael, "I can
guarantee this truth: You will see the
sky open and God’s angels going up and
coming down to the Son of Man."
1 Three days later a wedding took
place in the city of Cana in Galilee.
Jesus’ mother was there.
2 Jesus and his disciples had been
invited too.
3 When the wine was gone, Jesus’
mother said to him, "They’re out of
wine."
2JOHN 2
9
4 Jesus said to her, "Why did you come
to me? My me has not yet come."
5 His mother told the servers, "Do
whatever he tells you."
6 Six stone water jars were there. They
were used for Jewish puriﬁca on rituals.
Each jar held 18 to 27 gallons.
7 Jesus told the servers, "Fill the jars
with water." The servers ﬁlled the jars to
the brim.
8 Jesus said to them, "Pour some, and
take it to the person in charge." The
servers did as they were told.
9 The person in charge tasted the water
that had become wine. He didn’t know
where it had come from, although the
servers who had poured the water knew.
The person in charge called the groom
10 and said to him, "Everyone serves
the best wine ﬁrst. When people are
drunk, the host serves cheap wine. But
you have saved the best wine for now."JOHN 2
10
11 Cana in Galilee was the place where
Jesus began to perform miracles. He
made his glory public there, and his
disciples believed in him.
12 A er this, Jesus, his mother,
brothers, and disciples went to the city
of Capernaum and stayed there for a few
days.
13 The Jewish Passover was near, so
Jesus went to Jerusalem.
14 He found those who were selling
ca le, sheep, and pigeons in the temple
courtyard. He also found moneychangers
si ng there.
15 He made a whip from small ropes
and threw everyone with their sheep
and ca le out of the temple courtyard.
He dumped the moneychangers’ coins
and knocked over their tables.
16 He told those who sold pigeons,
"Pick up this stuﬀ, and get it out ofJOHN 2
11
here! Stop making my Father’s house a
marketplace!"
17 His disciples remembered that
Scripture said, "Devo on for your house
will consume me."
18 The Jews reacted by asking Jesus,
"What miracle can you show us to jus fy
what you’re doing?"
19 Jesus replied, "Tear down this
temple, and I’ll rebuild it in three days."
20 The Jews said, "It took forty–six years
to build this temple. Do you really think
you’re going to rebuild it in three days?"
21 But the temple Jesus spoke about
was his own body.
22 A er he came back to life, his
disciples remembered that he had said
this. So they believed the Scripture and
this statement that Jesus had made.
23 While Jesus was in Jerusalem at the
Passover fes val, many people believedJOHN 2 – 3
12
in him because they saw the miracles
that he performed.
24 Jesus, however, was wary of these
believers. He understood people
25 and didn’t need anyone to tell him
about human nature. He knew what
people were really like.
1 Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a
member of the Jewish council.
2 He came to Jesus one night and said to
him, "Rabbi, we know that God has sent
you as a teacher. No one can perform
the miracles you perform unless God is
with him."
3 Jesus replied to Nicodemus, "I can
guarantee this truth: No one can see
the kingdom of God without being born
from above."
4 Nicodemus asked him, "How can
anyone be born when he’s an old man?
He can’t go back inside his mother a
second me to be born, can he?"
3JOHN 3
13
5 Jesus answered Nicodemus, "I can
guarantee this truth: No one can enter
the kingdom of God without being born
of water and the Spirit.
6 Flesh and blood give birth to ﬂesh and
blood, but the Spirit gives birth to things
that are spiritual.
7 Don’t be surprised when I tell you that
all of you must be born from above.
8 The wind blows wherever it pleases.
You hear its sound, but you don’t know
where the wind comes from or where it’s
going. That’s the way it is with everyone
born of the Spirit."
9 Nicodemus replied, "How can that
be?"
10 Jesus told Nicodemus, "You’re a
well–known teacher of Israel. Can’t you
understand this?
11 I can guarantee this truth: We know
what we’re talking about, and weJOHN 3
14
conﬁrm what we’ve seen. Yet, you don’t
accept our message.
12 If you don’t believe me when I tell
you about things on earth, how will you
believe me when I tell you about things
in heaven?
13 No one has gone to heaven except
the Son of Man, who came from heaven.
14 "As Moses li ed up the snake on a
pole in the desert, so the Son of Man
must be li ed up.
15 Then everyone who believes in him
will have eternal life."
16 God loved the world this way: He
gave his only Son so that everyone who
believes in him will not die but will have
eternal life.
17 God sent his Son into the world, not
to condemn the world, but to save the
world.
18 Those who believe in him won’t
be condemned. But those who don’tJOHN 3
15
believe are already condemned because
they don’t believe in God’s only Son.
19 This is why people are condemned:
The light came into the world. Yet,
people loved the dark rather than the
light because their ac ons were evil.
20 People who do what is wrong hate
the light and don’t come to the light.
They don’t want their ac ons to be
exposed.
21 But people who do what is true come
to the light so that the things they do for
God may be clearly seen.
22 Later, Jesus and his disciples went to
the Judean countryside, where he spent
some me with them and bap zed
people.
23 John was bap zing in Aenon, near
Salim. Water was plen ful there. (People
came to John to be bap zed,
24 since John had not yet been put in
prison.)JOHN 3
16
25 Some of John’s disciples had an
argument with a Jew about puriﬁca on
ceremonies.
26 So they went to John and asked him,
"Rabbi, do you remember the man you
spoke so favorably about when he was
with you on the other side of the Jordan
River? Well, he’s bap zing, and everyone
is going to him!"
27 John answered, "People can’t receive
anything unless it has been given to
them from heaven.
28 You are witnesses that I said, ‘I’m not
the Messiah, but I’ve been sent ahead of
him.’
29 "The groom is the person to whom
the bride belongs. The best man, who
stands and listens to him, is overjoyed
when the groom speaks. This is the joy
that I feel.
30 He must increase in importance,
while I must decrease in importance.JOHN 3
17
31 "The person who comes from above
is superior to everyone. I, a person from
the earth, know nothing but what is on
earth, and that’s all I can talk about.
The person who comes from heaven is
superior to everyone
32 and tells what he has seen and heard.
Yet, no one accepts what he says.
33 I have accepted what that person
said, and I have aﬃrmed that God is
truthful.
34 The man whom God has sent speaks
God’s message. A er all, God gives him
the Spirit without limit.
35 The Father loves his Son and has put
everything in his power.
36 Whoever believes in the Son has
eternal life, but whoever rejects the
Son will not see life. Instead, he will see
God’s constant anger."JOHN 4
4
18
1 Jesus knew that the Pharisees
had heard that he was making and
bap zing more disciples than John.
2 (Actually, Jesus was not bap zing
people. His disciples were.)
3 So he le the Judean countryside and
went back to Galilee.
4 Jesus had to go through Samaria.
5 He arrived at a city in Samaria called
Sychar. Sychar was near the piece of land
that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
6 Jacob’s Well was there. Jesus sat down
by the well because he was red from
traveling. The me was about six o’clock
in the evening.
7 A Samaritan woman went to get some
water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink
of water."
8 (His disciples had gone into the city to
buy some food.)
9 The Samaritan woman asked him,
"How can a Jewish man like you ask aJOHN 4
19
Samaritan woman like me for a drink of
water?" (Jews, of course, don’t associate
with Samaritans.)
10 Jesus replied to her, "If you only knew
what God’s gi is and who is asking you
for a drink, you would have asked him
for a drink. He would have given you
living water."
11 The woman said to him, "Sir, you
don’t have anything to use to get water,
and the well is deep. So where are you
going to get this living water?
12 You’re not more important than our
ancestor Jacob, are you? He gave us this
well. He and his sons and his animals
drank water from it."
13 Jesus answered her, "Everyone who
drinks this water will become thirsty
again.
14 But those who drink the water that I
will give them will never become thirsty
again. In fact, the water I will give themJOHN 4
20
will become in them a spring that gushes
up to eternal life."
15 The woman told Jesus, "Sir, give me
this water! Then I won’t get thirsty or
have to come here to get water."
16 Jesus told her, "Go to your husband,
and bring him here."
17 The woman replied, "I don’t have a
husband." Jesus told her, "You’re right
when you say that you don’t have a
husband.
18 You’ve had ﬁve husbands, and the
man you have now isn’t your husband.
You’ve told the truth."
19 The woman said to Jesus, "I see that
you’re a prophet!
20 Our ancestors worshiped on this
mountain. But you Jews say that people
must worship in Jerusalem."
21 Jesus told her, "Believe me. A me is
coming when you Samaritans won’t beJOHN 4
21
worshiping the Father on this mountain
or in Jerusalem.
22 You don’t know what you’re
worshiping. We Jews know what we’re
worshiping, because salva on comes
from the Jews.
23 Indeed, the me is coming, and it is
now here, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth.
The Father is looking for people like that
to worship him.
24 God is a spirit. Those who worship
him must worship in spirit and truth."
25 The woman said to him, "I know that
the Messiah is coming. When he comes,
he will tell us everything." (Messiah is
the one called Christ.)
26 Jesus told her, "I am he, and I am
speaking to you now."
27 At that me his disciples returned.
They were surprised that he was talking
to a woman. But none of them askedJOHN 4
22
him, "What do you want from her?" or
"Why are you talking to her?"
28 Then the woman le her water jar
and went back into the city. She told the
people,
29 "Come with me, and meet a man
who told me everything I’ve ever done.
Could he be the Messiah?"
30 The people le the city and went to
meet Jesus.
31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging
him, "Rabbi, have something to eat."
32 Jesus told them, "I have food to eat
that you don’t know about."
33 The disciples asked each other, "Did
someone bring him something to eat?"
34 Jesus told them, "My food is to do
what the one who sent me wants me to
do and to ﬁnish the work he has given
me.
35 "Don’t you say, ‘In four more months
the harvest will be here’? I’m telling youJOHN 4
23
to look and see that the ﬁelds are ready
to be harvested.
36 The person who harvests the crop
is already ge ng paid. He is gathering
grain for eternal life. So the person who
plants the grain and the person who
harvests it are happy together.
37 In this respect the saying is true:
‘One person plants, and another person
harvests.’
38 I have sent you to harvest a crop
you have not worked for. Other people
have done the hard work, and you have
followed them in their work."
39 Many Samaritans in that city believed
in Jesus because of the woman who said,
"He told me everything I’ve ever done."
40 So when the Samaritans went to
Jesus, they asked him to stay with them.
He stayed in Samaria for two days.
41 Many more Samaritans believed
because of what Jesus said.JOHN 4
24
42 They told the woman, "Our faith is no
longer based on what you’ve said. We
have heard him ourselves, and we know
that he really is the savior of the world."
43 A er spending two days in Samaria,
Jesus le for Galilee.
44 Jesus had said that a prophet is not
honored in his own country.
45 But when Jesus arrived in Galilee, the
people of Galilee welcomed him. They
had seen everything he had done at the
fes val in Jerusalem, since they, too, had
a ended the fes val.
46 Jesus returned to the city of Cana in
Galilee, where he had changed water
into wine. A government oﬃcial was in
Cana. His son was sick in Capernaum.
47 The oﬃcial heard that Jesus had
returned from Judea to Galilee. So he
went to Jesus and asked him to go to
Capernaum with him to heal his son who
was about to die.JOHN 4
25
48 Jesus told the oﬃcial, "If people
don’t see miracles and amazing things,
they won’t believe."
49 The oﬃcial said to him, "Sir, come
with me before my li le boy dies."
50 Jesus told him, "Go home. Your son
will live." The man believed what Jesus
told him and le .
51 While the oﬃcial was on his way to
Capernaum, his servants met him and
told him that his boy was alive.
52 The oﬃcial asked them at what me
his son got be er. His servants told him,
"The fever le him yesterday evening at
seven o’clock."
53 Then the boy’s father realized that it
was the same me that Jesus had told
him, "Your son will live." So the oﬃcial
and his en re family became believers.
54 This was the second miracle that
Jesus performed a er he had come back
from Judea to Galilee.JOHN 5
5
26
1 Later, Jesus went to Jerusalem for
a Jewish fes val.
2 Near Sheep Gate in Jerusalem was a
pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It had
ﬁve porches.
3 Under these porches a large number
of sick people––people who were blind,
lame, or paralyzed––used to lie.
4 (OMITTED TEXT)
5 One man, who had been sick for 38
years, was lying there.
6 Jesus saw the man lying there and
knew that he had been sick for a long
me. So Jesus asked the man, "Would
you like to get well?"
7 The sick man answered Jesus, "Sir, I
don’t have anyone to put me into the
pool when the water is s rred. While I’m
trying to get there, someone else steps
into the pool ahead of me."
8 Jesus told the man, "Get up, pick up
your cot, and walk."JOHN 5
27
9 The man immediately became well,
picked up his cot, and walked. That
happened on a day of worship.
10 So the Jews told the man who had
been healed, "This is a day of worship.
You’re not allowed to carry your cot
today."
11 The man replied, "The man who
made me well told me to pick up my cot
and walk."
12 The Jews asked him, "Who is the man
who told you to pick it up and walk?"
13 But the man who had been healed
didn’t know who Jesus was. (Jesus had
withdrawn from the crowd.)
14 Later, Jesus met the man in the
temple courtyard and told him, "You’re
well now. Stop sinning so that something
worse doesn’t happen to you."
15 The man went back to the Jews and
told them that Jesus was the man who
had made him well.JOHN 5
28
16 The Jews began to persecute Jesus
because he kept healing people on the
day of worship.
17 Jesus replied to them, "My Father is
working right now, and so am I."
18 His reply made the Jews more intent
on killing him. Not only did he break the
laws about the day of worship, but also
he made himself equal to God when he
said repeatedly that God was his Father.
19 Jesus said to the Jews, "I can
guarantee this truth: The Son cannot
do anything on his own. He can do only
what he sees the Father doing. Indeed,
the Son does exactly what the Father
does.
20 The Father loves the Son and shows
him everything he is doing. The Father
will show him even greater things to do
than these things so that you will be
amazed.JOHN 5
29
21 In the same way that the Father
brings back the dead and gives them life,
the Son gives life to anyone he chooses.
22 "The Father doesn’t judge anyone.
He has entrusted judgment en rely to
the Son
23 so that everyone will honor the
Son as they honor the Father. Whoever
doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the
Father who sent him.
24 I can guarantee this truth: Those who
listen to what I say and believe in the
one who sent me will have eternal life.
They won’t be judged because they have
already passed from death to life.
25 "I can guarantee this truth: A me is
coming (and is now here) when the dead
will hear the voice of the Son of God and
those who respond to it will live.
26 The Father is the source of life, and
he has enabled the Son to be the source
of life too.JOHN 5
30
27 "He has also given the Son authority
to pass judgment because he is the Son
of Man.
28 Don’t be surprised at what I’ve just
said. A me is coming when all the dead
will hear his voice,
29 and they will come out of their
tombs. Those who have done good will
come back to life and live. But those who
have done evil will come back to life and
will be judged.
30 I can’t do anything on my own.
As I listen to the Father, I make my
judgments. My judgments are right
because I don’t try to do what I want but
what the one who sent me wants.
31 "If I tes fy on my own behalf, what I
say isn’t true.
32 Someone else tes ﬁes on my behalf,
and I know that what he says about me
is true.JOHN 5
33 You sent people to John the Bap
31
zer,
and he tes ﬁed to the truth.
34 But I don’t depend on human
tes mony. I’m telling you this to save
you.
35 John was a lamp that gave oﬀ
brilliant light. For a me you enjoyed the
pleasure of his light.
36 But I have something that tes ﬁes
more favorably on my behalf than John’s
tes mony. The tasks that the Father
gave me to carry out, these tasks which
I perform, tes fy on my behalf. They
prove that the Father has sent me.
37 The Father who sent me tes ﬁes on
my behalf. You have never heard his
voice, and you have never seen his form.
38 So you don’t have the Father’s
message within you, because you don’t
believe in the person he has sent.
39 You study the Scriptures in detail
because you think you have the sourceJOHN 5
32
of eternal life in them. These Scriptures
tes fy on my behalf.
40 Yet, you don’t want to come to me to
get eternal life.
41 "I don’t accept praise from humans.
42 But I know what kind of people you
are. You don’t have any love for God.
43 I have come with the authority my
Father has given me, but you don’t
accept me. If someone else comes with
his own authority, you will accept him.
44 How can you believe when you
accept each other’s praise and don’t
look for the praise that comes from the
only God?
45 "Don’t think that I will accuse you in
the presence of the Father. Moses, the
one you trust, is already accusing you.
46 If you really believed Moses, you
would believe me. Moses wrote about
me.JOHN 5 – 6
33
47 If you don’t believe what Moses
wrote, how will you ever believe what I
say?"
1 Jesus later crossed to the other side
of the Sea of Galilee (or the Sea of
Tiberias).
2 A large crowd followed him because
they saw the miracles that he performed
for the sick.
3 Jesus went up a mountain and sat
with his disciples.
4 The me for the Jewish Passover
fes val was near.
5 As Jesus saw a large crowd coming to
him, he said to Philip, "Where can we
buy bread for these people to eat?"
6 Jesus asked this ques on to test him.
He already knew what he was going to
do.
7 Philip answered, "We would need
about a year’s wages to buy enough
bread for each of them to have a piece."
6JOHN 6
34
8 One of Jesus’ disciples, Andrew, who
was Simon Peter’s brother, told him,
9 "A boy who has ﬁve loaves of barley
bread and two small ﬁsh is here. But they
won’t go very far for so many people."
10 Jesus said, "Have the people sit
down." The people had plenty of grass
to sit on. (There were about 5,000 men
in the crowd.)
11 Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks,
and distributed them to the people who
were si ng there. He did the same thing
with the ﬁsh. All the people ate as much
as they wanted.
12 When the people were full, Jesus
told his disciples, "Gather the le over
pieces so that nothing will be wasted."
13 The disciples gathered the le over
pieces of bread and ﬁlled twelve baskets.
14 When the people saw the miracle
Jesus performed, they said, "This manJOHN 6
35
is certainly the prophet who is to come
into the world."
15 Jesus realized that the people
intended to take him by force and
make him king. So he returned to the
mountain by himself.
16 When evening came, his disciples
went to the sea.
17 They got into a boat and started to
cross the sea to the city of Capernaum.
By this me it was dark, and Jesus had
not yet come to them.
18 A strong wind started to blow and
s r up the sea.
19 A er they had rowed three or four
miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea.
He was coming near the boat, and they
became terriﬁed.
20 Jesus told them, "It’s me. Don’t be
afraid!"
21 So they were willing to help Jesus
into the boat. Immediately, the boatJOHN 6
36
reached the shore where they were
going.
22 On the next day the people were
s ll on the other side of the sea. They
no ced that only one boat was there
and that Jesus had not stepped into that
boat with his disciples. The disciples had
gone away without him.
23 Other boats from Tiberias arrived
near the place where they had eaten the
bread a er the Lord gave thanks.
24 When the people saw that neither
Jesus nor his disciples were there, they
got into these boats and went to the city
of Capernaum to look for Jesus.
25 When they found him on the other
side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi,
when did you get here?"
26 Jesus replied to them, "I can
guarantee this truth: You’re not looking
for me because you saw miracles. YouJOHN 6
37
are looking for me because you ate as
much of those loaves as you wanted.
27 Don’t work for food that spoils.
Instead, work for the food that lasts into
eternal life. This is the food the Son of
Man will give you. A er all, the Father
has placed his seal of approval on him."
28 The people asked Jesus, "What does
God want us to do?"
29 Jesus replied to them, "God wants to
do something for you so that you believe
in the one whom he has sent."
30 The people asked him, "What miracle
are you going to perform so that we can
see it and believe in you? What are you
going to do?
31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the
desert. Scripture says, ‘He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.’"
32 Jesus said to them, "I can guarantee
this truth: Moses didn’t give you breadJOHN 6
38
from heaven, but my Father gives you
the true bread from heaven.
33 God’s bread is the man who comes
from heaven and gives life to the world."
34 They said to him, "Sir, give us this
bread all the me."
35 Jesus told them, "I am the bread of
life. Whoever comes to me will never
become hungry, and whoever believes
in me will never become thirsty.
36 I’ve told you that you have seen me.
However, you don’t believe in me.
37 Everyone whom the Father gives me
will come to me. I will never turn away
anyone who comes to me.
38 I haven’t come from heaven to do
what I want to do. I’ve come to do what
the one who sent me wants me to do.
39 The one who sent me doesn’t want
me to lose any of those he gave me. He
wants me to bring them back to life on
the last day.JOHN 6
39
40 My Father wants all those who see
the Son and believe in him to have
eternal life. He wants me to bring them
back to life on the last day."
41 The Jews began to cri cize Jesus for
saying, "I am the bread that came from
heaven."
42 They asked, "Isn’t this man Jesus,
Joseph’s son? Don’t we know his father
and mother? How can he say now, ‘I
came from heaven’?"
43 Jesus responded, "Stop cri cizing
me!
44 People cannot come to me unless
the Father who sent me brings them to
me. I will bring these people back to life
on the last day.
45 The prophets wrote, ‘God will teach
everyone.’ Those who do what they have
learned from the Father come to me.JOHN 6
40
46 I’m saying that no one has seen the
Father. Only the one who is from God
has seen the Father.
47 I can guarantee this truth: Every
believer has eternal life.
48 "I am the bread of life.
49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the
desert and died.
50 This is the bread that comes from
heaven so that whoever eats it won’t
die.
51 I am the living bread that came from
heaven. Whoever eats this bread will
live forever. The bread I will give to bring
life to the world is my ﬂesh."
52 The Jews began to quarrel with each
other. They said, "How can this man give
us his ﬂesh to eat?"
53 Jesus told them, "I can guarantee
this truth: If you don’t eat the ﬂesh of
the Son of Man and drink his blood, you
don’t have the source of life in you.JOHN 6
41
54 Those who eat my ﬂesh and drink my
blood have eternal life, and I will bring
them back to life on the last day.
55 My ﬂesh is true food, and my blood
is true drink.
56 Those who eat my ﬂesh and drink my
blood live in me, and I live in them.
57 The Father who has life sent me, and
I live because of the Father. So those
who feed on me will live because of me.
58 This is the bread that came from
heaven. It is not like the bread your
ancestors ate. They eventually died.
Those who eat this bread will live
forever."
59 Jesus said this while he was teaching
in a synagogue in Capernaum.
60 When many of Jesus’ disciples heard
him, they said, "What he says is hard
to accept. Who wants to listen to him
anymore?"JOHN 6
42
61 Jesus was aware that his disciples
were cri cizing his message. So Jesus
asked them, "Did what I say make you
lose faith?
62 What if you see the Son of Man go
where he was before?
63 Life is spiritual. Your physical
existence doesn’t contribute to that life.
The words that I have spoken to you are
spiritual. They are life.
64 But some of you don’t believe." Jesus
knew from the beginning those who
wouldn’t believe and the one who would
betray him.
65 So he added, "That is why I told you
that people cannot come to me unless
the Father provides the way."
66 Jesus’ speech made many of his
disciples go back to the lives they had
led before they followed Jesus.
67 So Jesus asked the twelve apostles,
"Do you want to leave me too?"JOHN 6 – 7
43
68 Simon Peter answered Jesus, "Lord,
to what person could we go? Your words
give eternal life.
69 Besides, we believe and know that
you are the Holy One of God."
70 Jesus replied, "I chose all twelve of
you. Yet, one of you is a devil."
71 Jesus meant Judas, son of Simon
Iscariot. Judas, who was one of the
twelve apostles, would later betray
Jesus.
1 Jesus later traveled throughout
Galilee. He didn’t want to travel in
Judea because Jews there wanted to kill
him.
2 The me for the Jewish Fes val of
Booths was near.
3 So Jesus’ brothers told him, "Leave
this place, and go to Judea so that your
disciples can see the things that you’re
doing.
7JOHN 7
44
4 No one does things secretly when he
wants to be known publicly. If you do
these things, you should let the world
see you."
5 Even his brothers didn’t believe in
him.
6 Jesus told them, "Now is not the right
me for me to go. Any me is right for
you.
7 The world cannot hate you, but
it hates me because I say that what
everyone does is evil.
8 Go to the fes val. I’m not going to this
fes val right now. Now is not the right
me for me to go."
9 A er saying this, Jesus stayed in
Galilee.
10 But a er his brothers had gone to
the fes val, Jesus went. He didn’t go
publicly but secretly.JOHN 7
45
11 The Jews were looking for Jesus in
the crowd at the fes val. They kept
asking, "Where is that man?"
12 The crowds argued about Jesus.
Some people said, "He’s a good man,"
while others said, "No he isn’t. He
deceives the people."
13 Yet, no one would talk openly about
him because they were afraid of the
Jews.
14 When the fes val was half over, Jesus
went to the temple courtyard and began
to teach.
15 The Jews were surprised and asked,
"How can this man be so educated when
he hasn’t gone to school?"
16 Jesus responded to them, "What I
teach doesn’t come from me but from
the one who sent me.
17 Those who want to follow the will
of God will know if what I teach is from
God or if I teach my own thoughts.JOHN 7
46
18 Those who speak their own thoughts
are looking for their own glory. But the
man who wants to bring glory to the
one who sent him is a true teacher and
doesn’t have dishonest mo ves.
19 Didn’t Moses give you his teachings?
Yet, none of you does what Moses
taught you. So why do you want to kill
me?"
20 The crowd answered, "You’re
possessed by a demon! Who wants to
kill you?"
21 Jesus answered them, "I performed
one miracle, and all of you are surprised
by it.
22 Moses gave you the teaching about
circumcision (although it didn’t come
from Moses but from our ancestors).
So you circumcise a male on a day of
worship.
23 If you circumcise a male on the day of
worship to follow Moses’ Teachings, whyJOHN 7
47
are you angry with me because I made a
man en rely well on the day of worship?
24 Stop judging by outward appearance!
Instead, judge correctly."
25 Some of the people who lived in
Jerusalem said, "Isn’t this the man they
want to kill?
26 But look at this! He’s speaking in
public, and no one is saying anything to
him! Can it be that the rulers really know
that this man is the Messiah?
27 However, we know where this man
comes from. When the Christ comes, no
one will know where he is from."
28 Then, while Jesus was teaching in the
temple courtyard, he said loudly, "You
know me, and you know where I come
from. I didn’t decide to come on my
own. The one who sent me is true. He’s
the one you don’t know.
29 I know him because I am from him
and he sent me."JOHN 7
48
30 The Jews tried to arrest him but
couldn’t because his me had not yet
come.
31 However, many people in the crowd
believed in him. They asked, "When the
Messiah comes, will he perform more
miracles than this man has?"
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd saying
things like this about him. So the chief
priests and the Pharisees sent temple
guards to arrest Jesus.
33 Jesus said, "I will s ll be with you for
a li le while. Then I’ll go to the one who
sent me.
34 You will look for me, but you won’t
ﬁnd me. You can’t go where I’m going."
35 The Jews said among themselves,
"Where does this man intend to go so
that we won’t ﬁnd him? Does he mean
that he’ll live with the Jews who are
sca ered among the Greeks and that
he’ll teach the Greeks?JOHN 7
49
36 What does he mean when he says,
‘You will look for me, but you won’t
ﬁnd me,’ and ‘You can’t go where I’m
going’?"
37 On the last and most important day
of the fes val, Jesus was standing in
the temple courtyard. He said loudly,
"Whoever is thirsty must come to me to
drink.
38 As Scripture says, ‘Streams of living
water will ﬂow from deep within the
person who believes in me.’"
39 Jesus said this about the Spirit, whom
his believers would receive. The Spirit
was not yet evident, as it would be a er
Jesus had been gloriﬁed.
40 A er some of the crowd heard Jesus
say these words, they said, "This man is
certainly the prophet."
41 Other people said, "This man is the
Messiah." S ll other people asked, "How
can the Messiah come from Galilee?JOHN 7
50
42 Doesn’t Scripture say that the
Messiah will come from the descendants
of David and from the village of
Bethlehem, where David lived?"
43 So the people were divided because
of Jesus.
44 Some of them wanted to arrest him,
but they couldn’t.
45 When the temple guards returned,
the chief priests and Pharisees asked
them, "Why didn’t you bring Jesus?"
46 The temple guards answered, "No
human has ever spoken like this man."
47 The Pharisees asked the temple
guards, "Have you been deceived too?
48 Has any ruler or any Pharisee
believed in him?
49 This crowd is cursed because it
doesn’t know Moses’ Teachings."
50 One of those Pharisees was
Nicodemus, who had previously visited
Jesus. Nicodemus asked them,JOHN 7 – 8
51
51 "Do Moses’ Teachings enable us to
judge a person without ﬁrst hearing
that person’s side of the story? We can’t
judge a person without ﬁnding out what
that person has done."
52 They asked Nicodemus, "Are you
saying this because you’re from Galilee?
Study the Scriptures, and you’ll see that
no prophet comes from Galilee."
53 Then each of them went home.
1 Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
2 Early the next morning he
returned to the temple courtyard. All the
people went to him, so he sat down and
began to teach them.
3 The scribes and the Pharisees
brought a woman who had been caught
commi ng adultery. They made her
stand in front of everyone
4 and asked Jesus, "Teacher, we caught
this woman in the act of adultery.
8JOHN 8
52
5 In his teachings, Moses ordered us to
stone women like this to death. What do
you say?"
6 They asked this to test him. They
wanted to ﬁnd a reason to bring charges
against him. Jesus bent down and used
his ﬁnger to write on the ground.
7 When they persisted in asking him
ques ons, he straightened up and said,
"The person who is sinless should be the
ﬁrst to throw a stone at her."
8 Then he bent down again and
con nued wri ng on the ground.
9 One by one, beginning with the older
men, the scribes and Pharisees le .
Jesus was le alone with the woman.
10 Then Jesus straightened up and
asked her, "Where did they go? Has
anyone condemned you?"
11 The woman answered, "No one, sir."
Jesus said, "I don’t condemn you either.
Go! From now on don’t sin."JOHN 8
53
12 Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again.
He said, "I am the light of the world.
Whoever follows me will have a life ﬁlled
with light and will never live in the dark."
13 The Pharisees said to him, "You
tes fy on your own behalf, so your
tes mony isn’t true."
14 Jesus replied to them, "Even if I
tes fy on my own behalf, my tes mony
is true because I know where I came
from and where I’m going. However, you
don’t know where I came from or where
I’m going.
15 You judge the way humans do. I don’t
judge anyone.
16 Even if I do judge, my judgment is
valid because I don’t make it on my own.
I make my judgment with the Father
who sent me.
17 Your own teachings say that the
tes mony of two people is true.JOHN 8
18 I tes
54
fy on my own behalf, and so
does the Father who sent me."
19 The Pharisees asked him, "Where is
your father?" Jesus replied, "You don’t
know me or my Father. If you knew me,
you would also know my Father."
20 Jesus spoke these words while he
was teaching in the treasury area of the
temple courtyard. No one arrested him,
because his me had not yet come.
21 Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again.
He said, "I’m going away, and you’ll look
for me. But you will die because of your
sin. You can’t go where I’m going."
22 Then the Jews asked, "Is he going to
kill himself? Is that what he means when
he says, ‘You can’t go where I’m going’?"
23 Jesus said to them, "You’re from
below. I’m from above. You’re from this
world. I’m not from this world.
24 For this reason I told you that you’ll
die because of your sins. If you don’tJOHN 8
55
believe that I am the one, you’ll die
because of your sins."
25 The Jews asked him, "Who did you
say you are?" Jesus told them, "I am who
I said I was from the beginning.
26 I have a lot I could say about you and
a lot I could condemn you for. But the
one who sent me is true. So I tell the
world exactly what he has told me."
27 (The Jews didn’t know that he was
talking to them about the Father.)
28 So Jesus told them, "When you have
li ed up the Son of Man, then you’ll
know that I am the one and that I can’t
do anything on my own. Instead, I speak
as the Father taught me.
29 Besides, the one who sent me is with
me. He hasn’t le me by myself. I always
do what pleases him."
30 As Jesus was saying this, many people
believed in him.JOHN 8
56
31 So Jesus said to those Jews who
believed in him, "If you live by what I say,
you are truly my disciples.
32 You will know the truth, and the truth
will set you free."
33 They replied to Jesus, "We are
Abraham’s descendants, and we’ve
never been anyone’s slaves. So how can
you say that we will be set free?"
34 Jesus answered them, "I can
guarantee this truth: Whoever lives a
sinful life is a slave to sin.
35 A slave doesn’t live in the home
forever, but a son does.
36 So if the Son sets you free, you will
be absolutely free.
37 I know that you’re Abraham’s
descendants. However, you want to kill
me because you don’t like what I’m
saying.JOHN 8
57
38 What I’m saying is what I have seen
in my Father’s presence. But you do
what you’ve heard from your father."
39 The Jews replied to Jesus, "Abraham
is our father." Jesus told them, "If you
were Abraham’s children, you would do
what Abraham did.
40 I am a man who has told you the
truth that I heard from God. But now
you want to kill me. Abraham wouldn’t
have done that.
41 You’re doing what your father does."
The Jews said to Jesus, "We’re not
illegi mate children. God is our only
Father."
42 Jesus told them, "If God were your
Father, you would love me. A er all, I’m
here, and I came from God. I didn’t come
on my own. Instead, God sent me.
43 Why don’t you understand the
language I use? Is it because you can’t
understand the words I use?JOHN 8
58
44 You come from your father, the
devil, and you desire to do what your
father wants you to do. The devil was
a murderer from the beginning. He has
never been truthful. He doesn’t know
what the truth is. Whenever he tells a
lie, he’s doing what comes naturally to
him. He’s a liar and the father of lies.
45 So you don’t believe me because I
tell the truth.
46 Can any of you convict me of
commi ng a sin? If I’m telling the truth,
why don’t you believe me?
47 The person who belongs to God
understands what God says. You don’t
understand because you don’t belong to
God."
48 The Jews replied to Jesus, "Aren’t
we right when we say that you’re a
Samaritan and that you’re possessed by
a demon?"JOHN 8
59
49 Jesus answered, "I’m not possessed.
I honor my Father, but you dishonor me.
50 I don’t want my own glory. But there
is someone who wants it, and he is the
judge.
51 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever
obeys what I say will never see death."
52 The Jews told Jesus, "Now we know
that you’re possessed by a demon.
Abraham died, and so did the prophets,
but you say, ‘Whoever does what I say
will never taste death.’
53 Are you greater than our father
Abraham, who died? The prophets have
also died. Who do you think you are?"
54 Jesus said, "If I bring glory to myself,
my glory is nothing. My Father is the one
who gives me glory, and you say that he
is your God.
55 Yet, you haven’t known him.
However, I know him. If I would say that
I didn’t know him, I would be a liar likeJOHN 8 – 9
60
all of you. But I do know him, and I do
what he says.
56 Your father Abraham was pleased to
see that my day was coming. He saw it
and was happy."
57 The Jews said to Jesus, "You’re not
even ﬁ y years old. How could you have
seen Abraham?"
58 Jesus told them, "I can guarantee this
truth: Before Abraham was ever born, I
am."
59 Then some of the Jews picked up
stones to throw at Jesus. However, Jesus
was concealed, and he le the temple
courtyard.
1 As Jesus walked along, he saw a
man who had been born blind.
2 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, why
was this man born blind? Did he or his
parents sin?"
3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man
nor his parents sinned. Instead, he was
9JOHN 9
61
born blind so that God could show what
he can do for him.
4 We must do what the one who sent
me wants us to do while it is day. The
night when no one can do anything is
coming.
5 As long as I’m in the world, I’m light
for the world."
6 A er Jesus said this, he spit on the
ground and mixed the spit with dirt.
Then he smeared it on the man’s eyes
7 and told him, "Wash it oﬀ in the pool
of Siloam." (Siloam means "sent.") The
blind man washed it oﬀ and returned.
He was able to see.
8 His neighbors and those who had
previously seen him begging asked,
"Isn’t this the man who used to sit and
beg?"
9 Some of them said, "He’s the one."
Others said, "No, he isn’t, but he looksJOHN 9
62
like him." But the man himself said, "I
am the one."
10 So they asked him, "How did you
receive your sight?"
11 He replied, "The man people call
Jesus mixed some spit with dirt, smeared
it on my eyes, and told me, ‘Go to
Siloam, and wash it oﬀ.’ So I went there,
washed it oﬀ, and received my sight."
12 They asked him, "Where is that
man?" The man answered, "I don’t
know."
13 Some people brought the man who
had been blind to the Pharisees.
14 The day when Jesus mixed the spit
and dirt and gave the man sight was a
day of worship.
15 So the Pharisees asked the man again
how he received his sight. The man told
the Pharisees, "He put a mixture of spit
and dirt on my eyes. I washed it oﬀ, and
now I can see."JOHN 9
63
16 Some of the Pharisees said, "The man
who did this is not from God because
he doesn’t follow the tradi ons for the
day of worship." Other Pharisees asked,
"How can a man who is a sinner perform
miracles like these?" So the Pharisees
were divided in their opinions.
17 They asked the man who had been
born blind another ques on: "What
do you say about the man who gave
you sight?" The man answered, "He’s a
prophet."
18 Un l they talked to the man’s
parents, the Jews didn’t believe that the
man had been blind and had been given
sight.
19 They asked his parents, "Is this your
son, the one you say was born blind?
Why can he see now?"
20 His parents replied, "We know that
he’s our son and that he was born blind.JOHN 9
64
21 But we don’t know how he got his
sight or who gave it to him. You’ll have
to ask him. He’s old enough to answer
for himself."
22 (His parents said this because they
were afraid of the Jews. The Jews had
already agreed to put anyone who
acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ
out of the synagogue.
23 That’s why his parents said, "You’ll
have to ask him. He’s old enough.")
24 So once again the Jews called the
man who had been blind. They told him,
"Give glory to God. We know that this
man who gave you sight is a sinner."
25 The man responded, "I don’t know if
he’s a sinner or not. But I do know one
thing. I used to be blind, but now I can
see."
26 The Jews asked him, "What did he do
to you? How did he give you sight?"JOHN 9
65
27 The man replied, "I’ve already told
you, but you didn’t listen. Why do you
want to hear the story again? Do you
want to become his disciples too?"
28 The Jews yelled at him, "You’re his
disciple, but we’re Moses’ disciples.
29 We know that God spoke to Moses,
but we don’t know where this man came
from."
30 The man replied to them, "That’s
amazing! You don’t know where he’s
from. Yet, he gave me sight.
31 We know that God doesn’t listen to
sinners. Instead, he listens to people
who are devout and who do what he
wants.
32 Since the beginning of me, no one
has ever heard of anyone giving sight to
a person born blind.
33 If this man were not from God, he
couldn’t do anything like that."JOHN 9
66
34 The Jews answered him, "You were
born full of sin. Do you think you can
teach us?" Then they threw him out of
the synagogue.
35 Jesus heard that the Jews had thrown
the man out of the synagogue. So when
Jesus found the man, he asked him, "Do
you believe in the Son of Man?"
36 The man replied, "Sir, tell me who he
is so that I can believe in him."
37 Jesus told him, "You’ve seen him. He
is the person who is now talking with
you."
38 The man bowed in front of Jesus and
said, "I believe, Lord."
39 Then Jesus said, "I have come into
this world to judge: Blind people will be
given sight, and those who can see will
become blind."
40 Some Pharisees who were with Jesus
heard this. So they asked him, "Do you
think we’re blind?"JOHN 9 – 10
67
41 Jesus told them, "If you were blind,
you wouldn’t be sinners. But now you
say, ‘We see,’ so you con nue to be
sinners.
1 "I can guarantee this truth: The
person who doesn’t enter the
sheep pen through the gate but climbs
in somewhere else is a thief or a robber.
2 But the one who enters through the
gate is the shepherd.
3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for
him, and the sheep respond to his voice.
He calls his sheep by name and leads
them out of the pen.
4 A er he has brought out all his sheep,
he walks ahead of them. The sheep
follow him because they recognize his
voice.
5 They won’t follow a stranger. Instead,
they will run away from a stranger
because they don’t recognize his voice."
10JOHN 10
6 Jesus used this illustra
68
on as he
talked to the people, but they didn’t
understand what he meant.
7 Jesus emphasized, "I can guarantee
this truth: I am the gate for the sheep.
8 All who came before I did were thieves
or robbers. However, the sheep didn’t
respond to them.
9 I am the gate. Those who enter the
sheep pen through me will be saved.
They will go in and out of the sheep pen
and ﬁnd food.
10 A thief comes to steal, kill, and
destroy. But I came so that my sheep
will have life and so that they will have
everything they need.
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
12 A hired hand isn’t a shepherd and
doesn’t own the sheep. When he sees
a wolf coming, he abandons the sheepJOHN 10
69
and quickly runs away. So the wolf drags
the sheep away and sca ers the ﬂock.
13 The hired hand is concerned about
what he’s going to get paid and not
about the sheep.
14 "I am the good shepherd. I know
my sheep as the Father knows me. My
sheep know me as I know the Father.
15 So I give my life for my sheep.
16 I also have other sheep that are not
from this pen. I must lead them. They,
too, will respond to my voice. So they
will be one ﬂock with one shepherd.
17 The Father loves me because I give
my life in order to take it back again.
18 No one takes my life from me. I give
my life of my own free will. I have the
authority to give my life, and I have the
authority to take my life back again. This
is what my Father ordered me to do."
19 The Jews were divided because of
what Jesus said.JOHN 10
70
20 Many of them said, "He’s possessed
by a demon! He’s crazy! Why do you
listen to him?"
21 Others said, "No one talks like this
if he’s possessed by a demon. Can a
demon give sight to the blind?"
22 The Fes val of the Dedica on of the
Temple took place in Jerusalem during
the winter.
23 Jesus was walking on Solomon’s
porch in the temple courtyard.
24 The Jews surrounded him. They
asked him, "How long will you keep us in
suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us
plainly."
25 Jesus answered them, "I’ve told you,
but you don’t believe me. The things
that I do in my Father’s name tes fy on
my behalf.
26 However, you don’t believe because
you’re not my sheep.JOHN 10
71
27 My sheep respond to my voice, and I
know who they are. They follow me,
28 and I give them eternal life. They will
never be lost, and no one will tear them
away from me.
29 My Father, who gave them to me, is
greater than everyone else, and no one
can tear them away from my Father.
30 The Father and I are one."
31 The Jews had again brought some
rocks to stone Jesus to death.
32 Jesus replied to them, "I’ve shown
you many good things that come from
the Father. For which of these good
things do you want to stone me to
death?"
33 The Jews answered Jesus, "We’re
going to stone you to death, not for
any good things you’ve done, but for
dishonoring God. You claim to be God,
although you’re only a man."JOHN 10
72
34 Jesus said to them, "Don’t your
Scriptures say, ‘I said, "You are gods"’?
35 The Scriptures cannot be discredited.
So if God calls people gods (and they
are the people to whom he gave the
Scriptures),
36 why do you say that I’m dishonoring
God because I said, ‘I’m the Son of God’?
God set me apart for this holy purpose
and has sent me into the world.
37 If I’m not doing the things my Father
does, don’t believe me.
38 But if I’m doing those things and
you refuse to believe me, then at least
believe the things that I’m doing. Then
you will know and recognize that the
Father is in me and that I am in the
Father."
39 The Jews tried to arrest Jesus again,
but he got away from them.JOHN 10 – 11
73
40 He went back across the Jordan River
and stayed in the place where John ﬁrst
bap zed people.
41 Many people went to Jesus. They
said, "John didn’t perform any miracles,
but everything John said about this man
is true."
42 Many people there believed in Jesus.
1 Lazarus, who lived in Bethany,
the village where Mary and her
sister Martha lived, was sick.
2 (Mary was the woman who poured
perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet
with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was
the one who was sick.)
3 So the sisters sent a messenger to tell
Jesus, "Lord, your close friend is sick."
4 When Jesus heard the message, he
said, "His sickness won’t result in death.
Instead, this sickness will bring glory to
God so that the Son of God will receive
glory through it."
11JOHN 11
74
5 Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and
Lazarus.
6 Yet, when Jesus heard that Lazarus
was sick, he stayed where he was for
two more days.
7 Then, a er the two days, Jesus said to
his disciples, "Let’s go back to Judea."
8 The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, not
long ago the Jews wanted to stone you
to death. Do you really want to go back
there?"
9 Jesus answered, "Aren’t there twelve
hours of daylight? Those who walk
during the day don’t stumble, because
they see the light of this world.
10 However, those who walk at night
stumble because they have no light in
themselves."
11 A er Jesus said this, he told his
disciples, "Our friend Lazarus is sleeping,
and I’m going to Bethany to wake him."JOHN 11
75
12 His disciples said to him, "Lord, if he’s
sleeping, he’ll get well."
13 Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead,
but the disciples thought Jesus meant
that Lazarus was only sleeping.
14 Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus
has died,
15 but I’m glad that I wasn’t there so
that you can grow in faith. Let’s go to
Lazarus."
16 Thomas, who was called Didymus,
said to the rest of the disciples, "Let’s go
so that we, too, can die with Jesus."
17 When Jesus arrived, he found that
Lazarus had been in the tomb for four
days.
18 (Bethany was near Jerusalem, not
quite two miles away.)
19 Many Jews had come to Martha
and Mary to comfort them about their
brother.JOHN 11
76
20 When Martha heard that Jesus was
coming, she went to meet him. Mary
stayed at home.
21 Martha told Jesus, "Lord, if you had
been here, my brother would not have
died.
22 But even now I know that God will
give you whatever you ask him."
23 Jesus told Martha, "Your brother will
come back to life."
24 Martha answered Jesus, "I know that
he’ll come back to life on the last day,
when everyone will come back to life."
25 Jesus said to her, "I am the one who
brings people back to life, and I am life
itself. Those who believe in me will live
even if they die.
26 Everyone who lives and believes in
me will never die. Do you believe that?"
27 Martha said to him, "Yes, Lord, I
believe that you are the Messiah, theJOHN 11
77
Son of God, the one who was expected
to come into the world."
28 A er Martha had said this, she went
back home and whispered to her sister
Mary, "The teacher is here, and he is
calling for you."
29 When Mary heard this, she got up
quickly and went to Jesus.
30 (Jesus had not yet come into the
village but was s ll where Martha had
met him.)
31 The Jews who were comfor ng Mary
in the house saw her get up quickly
and leave. So they followed her. They
thought that she was going to the tomb
to cry.
32 When Mary arrived where Jesus was
and saw him, she knelt at his feet and
said, "Lord, if you had been here, my
brother would not have died."JOHN 11
78
33 When Jesus saw her crying, and the
Jews who were crying with her, he was
deeply moved and troubled.
34 So Jesus asked, "Where did you put
Lazarus?" They answered him, "Lord,
come and see."
35 Jesus cried.
36 The Jews said, "See how much Jesus
loved him."
37 But some of the Jews asked,
"Couldn’t this man who gave a blind man
sight keep Lazarus from dying?"
38 Deeply moved again, Jesus went to
the tomb. It was a cave with a stone
covering the entrance.
39 Jesus said, "Take the stone away."
Martha, the dead man’s sister, told
Jesus, "Lord, there must already be a
stench. He’s been dead for four days."
40 Jesus said to her, "Didn’t I tell you
that if you believe, you would see God’s
glory?"JOHN 11
79
41 So the stone was moved away from
the entrance of the tomb. Jesus looked
up and said, "Father, I thank you for
hearing me.
42 I’ve known that you always hear me.
However, I’ve said this so that the crowd
standing around me will believe that you
sent me."
43 A er Jesus had said this, he shouted
as loudly as he could, "Lazarus, come
out!"
44 The dead man came out. Strips of
cloth were wound around his feet and
hands, and his face was wrapped with
a handkerchief. Jesus told them, "Free
Lazarus, and let him go."
45 Many Jews who had visited Mary and
had seen what Jesus had done believed
in him.
46 But some of them went to the
Pharisees and told them what Jesus had
done.JOHN 11
80
47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees
called a mee ng of the council. They
asked, "What are we doing? This man is
performing a lot of miracles.
48 If we let him con nue what he’s
doing, everyone will believe in him. Then
the Romans will take away our posi on
and our na on."
49 One of them, Caiaphas, who was
chief priest that year, told them, "You
people don’t know anything.
50 You haven’t even considered this:
It is be er for one man to die for the
people than for the whole na on to be
destroyed."
51 Caiaphas didn’t say this on his own.
As chief priest that year, he prophesied
that Jesus would die for the Jewish
na on.
52 He prophesied that Jesus wouldn’t
die merely for this na on, but thatJOHN 11
81
Jesus would die to bring God’s sca ered
children together and make them one.
53 From that day on, the Jewish council
planned to kill Jesus.
54 So Jesus no longer walked openly
among the Jews. Instead, he le Bethany
and went to the countryside near the
desert, to a city called Ephraim, where
he stayed with his disciples.
55 The Jewish Passover was near. Many
people came from the countryside to
Jerusalem to purify themselves before
the Passover.
56 As they stood in the temple
courtyard, they looked for Jesus and
asked each other, "Do you think that
he’ll avoid coming to the fes val?"
57 (The chief priests and the Pharisees
had given orders that whoever knew
where Jesus was should tell them so that
they could arrest him.)JOHN 12
12
82
1 Six days before Passover, Jesus
arrived in Bethany. Lazarus,
whom Jesus had brought back to life,
lived there.
2 Dinner was prepared for Jesus in
Bethany. Martha served the dinner, and
Lazarus was one of the people ea ng
with Jesus.
3 Mary took a bo le of very expensive
perfume made from pure nard and
poured it on Jesus’ feet. Then she dried
his feet with her hair. The fragrance of
the perfume ﬁlled the house.
4 One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot,
who was going to betray him, asked,
5 "Why wasn’t this perfume sold for a
high price and the money given to the
poor?"
6 (Judas didn’t say this because he cared
about the poor but because he was a
thief. He was in charge of the moneybag
and carried the contribu ons.)JOHN 12
83
7 Jesus said to Judas, "Leave her alone!
She has done this to prepare me for the
day I will be placed in a tomb.
8 You will always have the poor with
you, but you will not always have me
with you."
9 A large crowd of Jews found out that
Jesus was in Bethany. So they went there
not only to see Jesus but also to see
Lazarus, whom Jesus had brought back
to life.
10 The chief priests planned to kill
Lazarus too.
11 Lazarus was the reason why many
people were leaving the Jews and
believing in Jesus.
12 On the next day the large crowd that
had come to the Passover fes val heard
that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
13 So they took palm branches and
went to meet him. They were shou ng,
"Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comesJOHN 12
84
in the name of the Lord, the king of
Israel!"
14 Jesus obtained a donkey and sat on
it, as Scripture says:
15 "Don’t be afraid, people of Zion! Your
king is coming. He is riding on a donkey’s
colt."
16 At ﬁrst Jesus’ disciples didn’t know
what these prophecies meant. However,
when Jesus was gloriﬁed, the disciples
remembered that these prophecies had
been wri en about him. The disciples
remembered that they had taken part in
fulﬁlling the prophecies.
17 The people who had been with Jesus
when he called Lazarus from the tomb
and brought him back to life reported
what they had seen.
18 Because the crowd heard that Jesus
had performed this miracle, they came
to meet him.JOHN 12
85
19 The Pharisees said to each other,
"This is ge ng us nowhere. Look! The
whole world is following him!"
20 Some Greeks were among those who
came to worship during the Passover
fes val.
21 They went to Philip (who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, "Sir,
we would like to meet Jesus."
22 Philip told Andrew, and they told
Jesus.
23 Jesus replied to them, "The me has
come for the Son of Man to be gloriﬁed.
24 I can guarantee this truth: A single
grain of wheat doesn’t produce anything
unless it is planted in the ground and
dies. If it dies, it will produce a lot of
grain.
25 Those who love their lives will
destroy them, and those who hate their
lives in this world will guard them for
everlas ng life.JOHN 12
86
26 Those who serve me must follow me.
My servants will be with me wherever I
will be. If people serve me, the Father
will honor them.
27 "I am too deeply troubled now to
know how to express my feelings. Should
I say, ‘Father, save me from this me of
suﬀering’? No! I came for this me of
suﬀering.
28 Father, give glory to your name." A
voice from heaven said, "I have given it
glory, and I will give it glory again."
29 The crowd standing there heard the
voice and said that it had thundered.
Others in the crowd said that an angel
had talked to him.
30 Jesus replied, "That voice wasn’t for
my beneﬁt but for yours.
31 "This world is being judged now. The
ruler of this world will be thrown out
now.JOHN 12
32 When I have been li
87
ed up from the
earth, I will draw all people toward me."
33 By saying this, he indicated how he
was going to die.
34 The crowd responded to him, "We
have heard from the Scriptures that the
Messiah will remain here forever. So
how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must
be li ed up from the earth’? Who is this
‘Son of Man’?"
35 Jesus answered the crowd, "The
light will s ll be with you for a li le
while. Walk while you have light so
that darkness won’t defeat you. Those
who walk in the dark don’t know where
they’re going.
36 While you have the light, believe in
the light so that you will become people
whose lives show the light." A er Jesus
had said this, he was concealed as he
le .JOHN 12
88
37 Although they had seen Jesus
perform so many miracles, they
wouldn’t believe in him.
38 In this way the words of the prophet
Isaiah came true: "Lord, who has
believed our message? To whom has the
Lord’s power been revealed?"
39 So the people couldn’t believe
because, as Isaiah also said,
40 "God blinded them and made them
close–minded so that their eyes don’t
see and their minds don’t understand.
And they never turn to me for healing!"
41 Isaiah said this because he had seen
Jesus’ glory and had spoken about him.
42 Many rulers believed in Jesus.
However, they wouldn’t admit it publicly
because the Pharisees would have
thrown them out of the synagogue.
43 They were more concerned about
what people thought of them than about
what God thought of them.JOHN 12
89
44 Then Jesus said loudly, "Whoever
believes in me believes not only in me
but also in the one who sent me.
45 Whoever sees me sees the one who
sent me.
46 I am the light that has come into the
world so that everyone who believes in
me will not live in the dark.
47 If anyone hears my words and
doesn’t follow them, I don’t condemn
them. I didn’t come to condemn the
world but to save the world.
48 Those who reject me by not accep ng
what I say have a judge appointed for
them. The words that I have spoken will
judge them on the last day.
49 I have not spoken on my own.
Instead, the Father who sent me told me
what I should say and how I should say
it.JOHN 12 – 13
90
50 I know that what he commands is
eternal life. Whatever I say is what the
Father told me to say."
1 Before the Passover fes val,
Jesus knew that the me had
come for him to leave this world and go
back to the Father. Jesus loved his own
who were in the world, and he loved
them to the end.
2 While supper was taking place,
the devil had already put the idea of
betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas,
son of Simon Iscariot.
3 The Father had put everything in
Jesus’ control. Jesus knew that. He also
knew that he had come from God and
was going back to God.
4 So he got up from the table, removed
his outer clothes, took a towel, and ed
it around his waist.
5 Then he poured water into a basin
and began to wash the disciples’ feet
13JOHN 13
91
and dry them with the towel that he had
ed around his waist.
6 When Jesus came to Simon Peter,
Peter asked him, "Lord, are you going to
wash my feet?"
7 Jesus answered Peter, "You don’t
know now what I’m doing. You will
understand later."
8 Peter told Jesus, "You will never wash
my feet." Jesus replied to Peter, "If I
don’t wash you, you don’t belong to
me."
9 Simon Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, don’t
wash only my feet. Wash my hands and
my head too!"
10 Jesus told Peter, "People who have
washed are completely clean. They need
to have only their feet washed. All of
you, except for one, are clean."
11 (Jesus knew who was going to betray
him. That’s why he said, "All of you,
except for one, are clean.")JOHN 13
12 A
92
er Jesus had washed their feet
and put on his outer clothes, he took his
place at the table again. Then he asked
his disciples, "Do you understand what
I’ve done for you?
13 You call me teacher and Lord, and
you’re right because that’s what I am.
14 So if I, your Lord and teacher, have
washed your feet, you must wash each
other’s feet.
15 I’ve given you an example that you
should follow.
16 I can guarantee this truth: Slaves
are not superior to their owners, and
messengers are not superior to the
people who send them.
17 If you understand all of this, you
are blessed whenever you follow my
example.
18 "I’m not talking about all of you.
I know the people I’ve chosen to be
apostles. However, I’ve made my choiceJOHN 13
93
so that Scripture will come true. It says,
‘The one who eats my bread has turned
against me.’
19 I’m telling you now before it happens.
Then, when it happens, you will believe
that I am the one.
20 "I can guarantee this truth: Whoever
accepts me accepts the one who sent
me."
21 A er saying this, Jesus was deeply
troubled. He declared, "I can guarantee
this truth: One of you is going to betray
me!"
22 The disciples began looking at each
other and wondering which one of them
Jesus meant.
23 One disciple, the one whom Jesus
loved, was near him at the table.
24 Simon Peter mo oned to that
disciple and said, "Ask Jesus whom he’s
talking about!"JOHN 13
94
25 Leaning close to Jesus, that disciple
asked, "Lord, who is it?"
26 Jesus answered, "He’s the one to
whom I will give this piece of bread a er
I’ve dipped it in the sauce." So Jesus
dipped the bread and gave it to Judas,
son of Simon Iscariot.
27 Then, a er Judas took the piece of
bread, Satan entered him. So Jesus told
him, "Hurry! Do what you have to do."
28 No one at the table knew why Jesus
said this to him.
29 Judas had the moneybag. So some
thought that Jesus was telling him to buy
what they needed for the fes val or to
give something to the poor.
30 Judas took the piece of bread and
immediately went outside. It was night.
31 When Judas was gone, Jesus said,
"The Son of Man is now gloriﬁed, and
because of him God is gloriﬁed.JOHN 13
95
32 If God is gloriﬁed because of the Son
of Man, God will glorify the Son of Man
because of himself, and he will glorify
the Son of Man at once."
33 Jesus said, "Dear children, I will s ll
be with you for a li le while. I’m telling
you what I told the Jews. You will look for
me, but you can’t go where I’m going.
34 "I’m giving you a new commandment:
Love each other in the same way that I
have loved you.
35 Everyone will know that you are my
disciples because of your love for each
other."
36 Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where
are you going?" Jesus answered him,
"You can’t follow me now to the place
where I’m going. However, you will
follow me later."
37 Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, why can’t I
follow you now? I’ll give my life for you."JOHN 13 – 14
96
38 Jesus replied, "Will you give your
life for me? I can guarantee this truth:
No rooster will crow un l you say three
mes that you don’t know me.
1 "Don’t be troubled. Believe in
God, and believe in me.
2 My Father’s house has many rooms.
If that were not true, would I have told
you that I’m going to prepare a place for
you?
3 If I go to prepare a place for you, I will
come again. Then I will bring you into my
presence so that you will be where I am.
4 You know the way to the place where
I am going."
5 Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don’t
know where you’re going. So how can
we know the way?"
6 Jesus answered him, "I am the way,
the truth, and the life. No one goes to
the Father except through me.
14JOHN 14
97
7 If you have known me, you will also
know my Father. From now on you know
him through me and have seen him in
me."
8 Philip said to Jesus, "Lord, show us the
Father, and that will sa sfy us."
9 Jesus replied, "I have been with all of
you for a long me. Don’t you know me
yet, Philip? The person who has seen me
has seen the Father. So how can you say,
‘Show us the Father’?
10 Don’t you believe that I am in the
Father and the Father is in me? What I’m
telling you doesn’t come from me. The
Father, who lives in me, does what he
wants.
11 Believe me when I say that I am in
the Father and that the Father is in me.
Otherwise, believe me because of the
things I do.
12 "I can guarantee this truth: Those
who believe in me will do the things thatJOHN 14
98
I am doing. They will do even greater
things because I am going to the Father.
13 I will do anything you ask the Father
in my name so that the Father will be
given glory because of the Son.
14 If you ask me to do something, I will
do it.
15 "If you love me, you will obey my
commandments.
16 I will ask the Father, and he will give
you another helper who will be with you
forever.
17 That helper is the Spirit of Truth. The
world cannot accept him, because it
doesn’t see or know him. You know him,
because he lives with you and will be in
you.
18 "I will not leave you all alone. I will
come back to you.
19 In a li le while the world will no
longer see me, but you will see me. You
will live because I live.JOHN 14
99
20 On that day you will know that I am
in my Father and that you are in me and
that I am in you.
21 Whoever knows and obeys my
commandments is the person who loves
me. Those who love me will have my
Father’s love, and I, too, will love them
and show myself to them."
22 Judas (not Iscariot) asked Jesus,
"Lord, what has happened that you are
going to reveal yourself to us and not to
the world?"
23 Jesus answered him, "Those who
love me will do what I say. My Father will
love them, and we will go to them and
make our home with them.
24 A person who doesn’t love me
doesn’t do what I say. I don’t make up
what you hear me say. What I say comes
from the Father who sent me.
25 "I have told you this while I’m s ll
with you.JOHN 14
100
26 However, the helper, the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father will send in my name,
will teach you everything. He will remind
you of everything that I have ever told
you.
27 "I’m leaving you peace. I’m giving
you my peace. I don’t give you the kind
of peace that the world gives. So don’t
be troubled or cowardly.
28 You heard me tell you, ‘I’m going
away, but I’m coming back to you.’ If you
loved me, you would be glad that I’m
going to the Father, because the Father
is greater than I am.
29 "I’m telling you this now before it
happens. When it does happen, you will
believe.
30 The ruler of this world has no power
over me. But he’s coming, so I won’t talk
with you much longer.
31 However, I want the world to know
that I love the Father and that I am doingJOHN 15
101
exactly what the Father has commanded
me to do. Get up! We have to leave."
1 Then Jesus said, "I am the true
vine, and my Father takes care of
the vineyard.
2 He removes every one of my branches
that doesn’t produce fruit. He also
prunes every branch that does produce
fruit to make it produce more fruit.
3 "You are already clean because of
what I have told you.
4 Live in me, and I will live in you. A
branch cannot produce any fruit by itself.
It has to stay a ached to the vine. In
the same way, you cannot produce fruit
unless you live in me.
5 "I am the vine. You are the branches.
Those who live in me while I live in them
will produce a lot of fruit. But you can’t
produce anything without me.
6 Whoever doesn’t live in me is thrown
away like a branch and dries up.
15JOHN 15
102
Branches like this are gathered, thrown
into a ﬁre, and burned.
7 If you live in me and what I say lives in
you, then ask for anything you want, and
it will be yours.
8 You give glory to my Father when you
produce a lot of fruit and therefore show
that you are my disciples.
9 "I have loved you the same way the
Father has loved me. So live in my love.
10 If you obey my commandments, you
will live in my love. I have obeyed my
Father’s commandments, and in that
way I live in his love.
11 I have told you this so that you will
be as joyful as I am, and your joy will be
complete.
12 Love each other as I have loved you.
This is what I’m commanding you to do.
13 The greatest love you can show is to
give your life for your friends.JOHN 15
103
14 You are my friends if you obey my
commandments.
15 I don’t call you servants anymore,
because a servant doesn’t know what
his master is doing. But I’ve called you
friends because I’ve made known to
you everything that I’ve heard from my
Father.
16 You didn’t choose me, but I chose
you. I have appointed you to go, to
produce fruit that will last, and to ask the
Father in my name to give you whatever
you ask for.
17 Love each other. This is what I’m
commanding you to do.
18 "If the world hates you, realize that it
hated me before it hated you.
19 If you had anything in common with
the world, the world would love you
as one of its own. But you don’t have
anything in common with the world. IJOHN 15
104
chose you from the world, and that’s
why the world hates you.
20 Remember what I told you: ‘A servant
isn’t greater than his master.’ If they
persecuted me, they will also persecute
you. If they did what I said, they will also
do what you say.
21 Indeed, they will do all this to you
because you are commi ed to me, since
they don’t know the one who sent me.
22 If I hadn’t come and spoken to them,
they wouldn’t have any sin. But now
they have no excuse for their sin.
23 The person who hates me also hates
my Father.
24 If I hadn’t done among them what no
one else has done, they wouldn’t have
any sin. But now they have seen and
hated both me and my Father.
25 In this way what is wri en in their
Scriptures has come true: ‘They hate me
for no reason.’JOHN 15 – 16
105
26 "The helper whom I will send to you
from the Father will come. This helper,
the Spirit of Truth who comes from the
Father, will declare the truth about me.
27 You will declare the truth, too,
because you have been with me from
the beginning."
1 Jesus con nued, "I have said
these things to you so that you
won’t lose your faith.
2 You will be thrown out of synagogues.
Certainly, the me is coming when
people who murder you will think that
they are serving God.
3 They will do these things to you
because they haven’t known the Father
or me.
4 But I’ve told you this so that when it
happens you’ll remember what I’ve told
you. I didn’t tell you this at ﬁrst, because
I was with you.
16JOHN 16
106
5 "Now I’m going to the one who sent
me. Yet, none of you asks me where I’m
going.
6 But because I’ve told you this, you’re
ﬁlled with sadness.
7 However, I am telling you the truth:
It’s good for you that I’m going away. If I
don’t go away, the helper won’t come to
you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
8 He will come to convict the world of
sin, to show the world what has God’s
approval, and to convince the world that
God judges it.
9 He will convict the world of sin,
because people don’t believe in me.
10 He will show the world what has
God’s approval, because I’m going to the
Father and you won’t see me anymore.
11 He will convince the world that God
judges it, because the ruler of this world
has been judged.JOHN 16
107
12 "I have a lot more to tell you, but that
would be too much for you now.
13 When the Spirit of Truth comes, he
will guide you into the full truth. He
won’t speak on his own. He will speak
what he hears and will tell you about
things to come.
14 He will give me glory, because he will
tell you what I say.
15 Everything the Father says is also
what I say. That is why I said, ‘He will
take what I say and tell it to you.’
16 "In a li le while you won’t see me
anymore. Then in a li le while you will
see me again."
17 Some of his disciples said to each
other, "What does he mean? He tells us
that in a li le while we won’t see him.
Then he tells us that in a li le while we
will see him again and that he’s going to
the Father."JOHN 16
108
18 So they were asking each other,
"What does he mean when he says, ‘In a
li le while’? We don’t understand what
he’s talking about."
19 Jesus knew they wanted to ask him
something. So he said to them, "Are you
trying to ﬁgure out among yourselves
what I meant when I said, ‘In a li le
while you won’t see me, and in a li le
while you will see me again’?
20 I can guarantee this truth: You will
cry because you are sad, but the world
will be happy. You will feel pain, but your
pain will turn to happiness.
21 A woman has pain when her me to
give birth comes. But a er the child is
born, she doesn’t remember the pain
anymore because she’s happy that a
child has been brought into the world.
22 "Now you’re in a painful situa on.
But I will see you again. Then you willJOHN 16
109
be happy, and no one will take that
happiness away from you.
23 When that day comes, you won’t ask
me any more ques ons. I can guarantee
this truth: If you ask the Father for
anything in my name, he will give it to
you.
24 So far you haven’t asked for anything
in my name. Ask and you will receive so
that you can be completely happy.
25 "I have used examples to illustrate
these things. The me is coming when
I won’t use examples to speak to you.
Rather, I will speak to you about the
Father in plain words.
26 When that day comes, you will ask
for what you want in my name. I’m
telling you that I won’t have to ask the
Father for you.
27 The Father loves you because you
have loved me and have believed that I
came from God.JOHN 16
28 I le
110
the Father and came into the
world. Again, as I’ve said, I’m going
to leave the world and go back to the
Father."
29 His disciples said, "Now you’re talking
in plain words and not using examples.
30 Now we know that you know
everything. You don’t need to wait for
ques ons to be asked. Because of this,
we believe that you have come from
God."
31 Jesus replied to them, "Now you
believe.
32 The me is coming, and is already
here, when all of you will be sca ered.
Each of you will go your own way and
leave me all alone. Yet, I’m not all alone,
because the Father is with me.
33 I’ve told you this so that my peace
will be with you. In the world you’ll have
trouble. But cheer up! I have overcome
the world."JOHN 17
1A
111
er saying this, Jesus looked
up to heaven and said, "Father,
the me is here. Give your Son glory so
that your Son can give you glory.
2 A er all, you’ve given him authority
over all humanity so that he can give
eternal life to all those you gave to him.
3 This is eternal life: to know you, the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
you sent.
4 On earth I have given you glory by
ﬁnishing the work you gave me to do.
5 Now, Father, give me glory in your
presence with the glory I had with you
before the world existed.
6 "I made your name known to the
people you gave me. They are from this
world. They belonged to you, and you
gave them to me. They did what you told
them.
7 Now they know that everything you
gave me comes from you,
17JOHN 17
112
8 because I gave them the message that
you gave me. They have accepted this
message, and they know for sure that I
came from you. They have believed that
you sent me.
9 "I pray for them. I’m not praying for
the world but for those you gave me,
because they are yours.
10 Everything I have is yours, and
everything you have is mine. I have been
given glory by the people you have given
me.
11 I won’t be in the world much longer,
but they are in the world, and I’m coming
back to you. Holy Father, keep them safe
by the power of your name, the name
that you gave me, so that their unity may
be like ours.
12 While I was with them, I kept them
safe by the power of your name, the
name that you gave me. I watched over
them, and none of them, except oneJOHN 17
113
person, became lost. So Scripture came
true.
13 "But now, Father, I’m coming back
to you. I say these things while I’m s ll
in the world so that they will have the
same joy that I have.
14 I have given them your message. But
the world has hated them because they
don’t belong to the world any more than
I belong to the world.
15 I’m not asking you to take them out
of the world but to protect them from
the evil one.
16 They don’t belong to the world any
more than I belong to the world.
17 "Use the truth to make them holy.
Your words are truth.
18 I have sent them into the world the
same way you sent me into the world.
19 I’m dedica ng myself to this holy
work I’m doing for them so that they,
too, will use the truth to be holy.JOHN 17
114
20 "I’m not praying only for them. I’m
also praying for those who will believe in
me through their message.
21 I pray that all of these people
con nue to have unity in the way that
you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I
pray that they may be united with us so
that the world will believe that you have
sent me.
22 I have given them the glory that
you gave me. I did this so that they are
united in the same way we are.
23 I am in them, and you are in me. So
they are completely united. In this way
the world knows that you have sent me
and that you have loved them in the
same way you have loved me.
24 "Father, I want those you have given
to me to be with me, to be where I am.
I want them to see my glory, which you
gave me because you loved me before
the world was made.JOHN 17 – 18
115
25 Righteous Father, the world didn’t
know you. Yet, I knew you, and these
disciples have known that you sent me.
26 I have made your name known to
them, and I will make it known so that
the love you have for me will be in them
and I will be in them."
1 A er Jesus ﬁnished his prayer,
he went with his disciples to the
other side of the Kidron Valley. They
entered the garden that was there.
2 Judas, who betrayed him, knew the
place because Jesus and his disciples
o en gathered there.
3 So Judas took a troop of soldiers and
the guards from the chief priests and
Pharisees and went to the garden. They
were carrying lanterns, torches, and
weapons.
4 Jesus knew everything that was going
to happen to him. So he went to meet
18JOHN 18
116
them and asked, "Who are you looking
for?"
5 They answered him, "Jesus from
Nazareth." Jesus told them, "I am he."
Judas, who betrayed him, was standing
with the crowd.
6 When Jesus told them, "I am he,"
the crowd backed away and fell to the
ground.
7 Jesus asked them again, "Who are
you looking for?" They said, "Jesus from
Nazareth."
8 Jesus replied, "I told you that I am he.
So if you are looking for me, let these
other men go."
9 In this way what Jesus had said came
true: "I lost none of those you gave me."
10 Simon Peter had a sword. He drew
it, a acked the chief priest’s servant,
and cut oﬀ the servant’s right ear. (The
servant’s name was Malchus.)JOHN 18
117
11 Jesus told Peter, "Put your sword
away. Shouldn’t I drink the cup of
suﬀering that my Father has given me?"
12 Then the army oﬃcer and the Jewish
guards arrested Jesus. They ed Jesus up
13 and took him ﬁrst to Annas, the
father–in–law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas, the
chief priest that year,
14 was the person who had advised the
Jews that it was be er to have one man
die for the people.
15 Simon Peter and another disciple
followed Jesus. The other disciple was
well–known to the chief priest. So that
disciple went with Jesus into the chief
priest’s courtyard.
16 Peter, however, was standing outside
the gate. The other disciple talked to the
woman who was the gatekeeper and
brought Peter into the courtyard.JOHN 18
118
17 The gatekeeper asked Peter, "Aren’t
you one of this man’s disciples too?"
Peter answered, "No, I’m not!"
18 The servants and the guards were
standing around a ﬁre they had built and
were warming themselves because it
was cold. Peter was standing there, too,
and warming himself with the others.
19 The chief priest ques oned Jesus
about his disciples and his teachings.
20 Jesus answered him, "I have spoken
publicly for everyone to hear. I have
always taught in synagogues or in the
temple courtyard, where all the Jews
gather. I haven’t said anything in secret.
21 Why do you ques on me? Ques on
those who heard what I said to them.
They know what I’ve said."
22 When Jesus said this, one of the
guards standing near Jesus slapped his
face and said, "Is that how you answer
the chief priest?"JOHN 18
119
23 Jesus replied to him, "If I’ve said
anything wrong, tell me what it was. But
if I’ve told the truth, why do you hit me?"
24 Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas, the
chief priest. Jesus was s ll ed up.
25 Simon Peter con nued to stand and
warm himself by the ﬁre. Some men
asked him, "Aren’t you, too, one of his
disciples?" Peter denied it by saying,
"No, I’m not!"
26 One of the chief priest’s servants, a
rela ve of the man whose ear Peter had
cut oﬀ, asked him, "Didn’t I see you with
Jesus in the garden?"
27 Peter again denied it, and just then a
rooster crowed.
28 Early in the morning, Jesus was taken
from Caiaphas’ house to the governor’s
palace. The Jews wouldn’t go into the
palace. They didn’t want to become
unclean, since they wanted to eat the
Passover.JOHN 18
120
29 So Pilate came out to them and
asked, "What accusa on are you making
against this man?"
30 The Jews answered Pilate, "If he
weren’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have
handed him over to you."
31 Pilate told the Jews, "Take him, and
try him by your law." The Jews answered
him, "We’re not allowed to execute
anyone."
32 In this way what Jesus had predicted
about how he would die came true.
33 Pilate went back into the palace,
called for Jesus, and asked him, "Are you
the king of the Jews?"
34 Jesus replied, "Did you think of that
yourself, or did others tell you about
me?"
35 Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your
own people and the chief priests handed
you over to me. What have you done?"JOHN 18
121
36 Jesus answered, "My kingdom
doesn’t belong to this world. If my
kingdom belonged to this world, my
followers would ﬁght to keep me from
being handed over to the Jews. My
kingdom doesn’t have its origin on
earth."
37 Pilate asked him, "So you are a king?"
Jesus replied, "You’re correct in saying
that I’m a king. I have been born and
have come into the world for this reason:
to tes fy to the truth. Everyone who
belongs to the truth listens to me."
38 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"
A er Pilate said this, he went out to the
Jews again and told them, "I don’t ﬁnd
this man guilty of anything.
39 You have a custom that I should free
one person for you at Passover. Would
you like me to free the king of the Jews
for you?"JOHN 18 – 19
122
40 The Jews shouted again, "Don’t free
this man! Free Barabbas!" (Barabbas
was a poli cal revolu onary.)
1 Then Pilate had Jesus taken
away and whipped.
2 The soldiers twisted some thorny
branches into a crown, placed it on his
head, and put a purple cape on him.
3 They went up to him, said, "Long live
the king of the Jews!" and slapped his
face.
4 Pilate went outside again and told the
Jews, "I’m bringing him out to you to
let you know that I don’t ﬁnd this man
guilty of anything."
5 Jesus went outside. He was wearing
the crown of thorns and the purple cape.
Pilate said to the Jews, "Look, here’s the
man!"
6 When the chief priests and the guards
saw Jesus, they shouted, "Crucify him!
Crucify him!" Pilate told them, "You take

123
him and crucify him. I don’t ﬁnd this man
guilty of anything."
7 The Jews answered Pilate, "We have a
law, and by that law he must die because
he claimed to be the Son of God."
8 When Pilate heard them say that, he
became more afraid than ever.
9 He went into the palace again and
asked Jesus, "Where are you from?" But
Jesus didn’t answer him.
10 So Pilate said to Jesus, "Aren’t you
going to answer me? Don’t you know
that I have the authority to free you or
to crucify you?"
11 Jesus answered Pilate, "You wouldn’t
have any authority over me if it hadn’t
been given to you from above. That’s
why the man who handed me over to
you is guilty of a greater sin."
12 When Pilate heard what Jesus said,
he wanted to free him. But the Jews
shouted, "If you free this man, you’reJOHN 19
124
not a friend of the emperor. Anyone
who claims to be a king is defying the
emperor."
13 When Pilate heard what they said, he
took Jesus outside and sat on the judge’s
seat in a place called Stone Pavement.
(In Hebrew it is called Gabbatha.)
14 The me was about six o’clock in the
morning on the Friday of the Passover
fes val. Pilate said to the Jews, "Look,
here’s your king!"
15 Then the Jews shouted, "Kill him! Kill
him! Crucify him!" Pilate asked them,
"Should I crucify your king?" The chief
priests responded, "The emperor is the
only king we have!"
16 Then Pilate handed Jesus over to
them to be cruciﬁed. So the soldiers took
Jesus.
17 He carried his own cross and went
out of the city to a loca on called TheJOHN 19
125
Skull. (In Hebrew this place is called
Golgotha.)
18 The soldiers cruciﬁed Jesus and
two other men there. Jesus was in the
middle.
19 Pilate wrote a no ce and put it on
the cross. The no ce read, "Jesus from
Nazareth, the king of the Jews."
20 Many Jews read this no ce, because
the place where Jesus was cruciﬁed was
near the city. The no ce was wri en in
Hebrew, La n, and Greek.
21 The chief priests of the Jewish people
told Pilate, "Don’t write, ‘The king of the
Jews!’ Instead, write, ‘He said that he is
the king of the Jews.’"
22 Pilate replied, "I have wri en what
I’ve wri en."
23 When the soldiers had cruciﬁed
Jesus, they took his clothes and divided
them four ways so that each soldier
could have a share. His robe was leJOHN 19
126
over. It didn’t have a seam because it
had been woven in one piece from top
to bo om.
24 The soldiers said to each other, "Let’s
not rip it apart. Let’s throw dice to see
who will get it." In this way the Scripture
came true: "They divided my clothes
among themselves. They threw dice for
my clothing." So that’s what the soldiers
did.
25 Jesus’ mother, her sister, Mary (the
wife of Clopas), and Mary from Magdala
were standing beside Jesus’ cross.
26 Jesus saw his mother and the disciple
whom he loved standing there. He said
to his mother, "Look, here’s your son!"
27 Then he said to the disciple, "Look,
here’s your mother!" From that me on
she lived with that disciple in his home.
28 A er this, when Jesus knew that
everything had now been ﬁnished, heJOHN 19
127
said, "I’m thirsty." He said this so that
Scripture could ﬁnally be concluded.
29 A jar ﬁlled with vinegar was there. So
the soldiers put a sponge soaked in the
vinegar on a hyssop s ck and held it to
his mouth.
30 A er Jesus had taken the vinegar, he
said, "It is ﬁnished!" Then he bowed his
head and died.
31 Since it was Friday and the next
day was an especially important day of
worship, the Jews didn’t want the bodies
to stay on the crosses. So they asked
Pilate to have the men’s legs broken and
their bodies removed.
32 The soldiers broke the legs of the ﬁrst
man and then of the other man who had
been cruciﬁed with Jesus.
33 When the soldiers came to Jesus
and saw that he was already dead, they
didn’t break his legs.JOHN 19
128
34 However, one of the soldiers stabbed
Jesus’ side with his spear, and blood and
water immediately came out.
35 The one who saw this is an
eyewitness. What he says is true, and he
knows that he is telling the truth so that
you, too, will believe.
36 This happened so that the Scripture
would come true: "None of his bones
will be broken."
37 Another Scripture passage says,
"They will look at the person whom they
have stabbed."
38 Later Joseph from the city of
Arimathea asked Pilate to let him
remove Jesus’ body. (Joseph was a
disciple of Jesus but secretly because he
was afraid of the Jews). Pilate gave him
permission to remove Jesus’ body. So
Joseph removed it.
39 Nicodemus, the one who had ﬁrst
come to Jesus at night, went with JosephJOHN 19 – 20
129
and brought 75 pounds of a myrrh and
aloe mixture.
40 These two men took the body of
Jesus and bound it with strips of linen.
They laced the strips with spices. This
was the Jewish custom for burial.
41 A garden was located in the place
where Jesus was cruciﬁed. In that garden
was a new tomb in which no one had yet
been placed.
42 Joseph and Nicodemus put Jesus in
that tomb, since that day was the Jewish
day of prepara on and since the tomb
was nearby.
1 Early on Sunday morning, while
it was s ll dark, Mary from
Magdala went to the tomb. She saw that
the stone had been removed from the
tomb’s entrance.
2 So she ran to Simon Peter and the
other disciple, whom Jesus loved. She
told them, "They have removed the
20JOHN 20
130
Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know
where they’ve put him."
3 So Peter and the other disciple headed
for the tomb.
4 The two were running side by side,
but the other disciple ran faster than
Peter and came to the tomb ﬁrst.
5 He bent over and looked inside the
tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying
there but didn’t go inside.
6 Simon Peter arrived a er him and
went into the tomb. He saw the strips of
linen lying there.
7 He also saw the cloth that had been
on Jesus’ head. It wasn’t lying with
the strips of linen but was rolled up
separately.
8 Then the other disciple, who arrived
at the tomb ﬁrst, went inside. He saw
and believed.JOHN 20
131
9 They didn’t know yet what Scripture
meant when it said that Jesus had to
come back to life.
10 So the disciples went back home.
11 Mary, however, stood there and cried
as she looked at the tomb. As she cried,
she bent over and looked inside.
12 She saw two angels in white clothes.
They were si ng where the body of
Jesus had been lying. One angel was
where Jesus’ head had been, and the
other was where his feet had been.
13 The angels asked her why she was
crying. Mary told them, "They have
removed my Lord, and I don’t know
where they’ve put him."
14 A er she said this, she turned around
and saw Jesus standing there. However,
she didn’t know that it was Jesus.
15 Jesus asked her, "Why are you crying?
Who are you looking for?" Mary thought
it was the gardener speaking to her. SoJOHN 20
132
she said to him, "Sir, if you carried him
away, tell me where you have put him,
and I’ll remove him."
16 Jesus said to her, "Mary!" Mary
turned around and said to him in
Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (This word means
"teacher.")
17 Jesus told her, "Don’t hold on to me.
I have not yet gone to the Father. But go
to my brothers and sisters and tell them,
‘I am going to my Father and your Father,
to my God and your God.’"
18 Mary from Magdala went to the
disciples and told them, "I have seen the
Lord." She also told them what he had
said to her.
19 That Sunday evening, the disciples
were together behind locked doors
because they were afraid of the Jews.
Jesus stood among them and said to
them, "Peace be with you!"JOHN 20
133
20 When he said this, he showed them
his hands and his side. The disciples
were glad to see the Lord.
21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace be
with you! As the Father has sent me, so I
am sending you."
22 A er he had said this, he breathed
on the disciples and said, "Receive the
Holy Spirit.
23 Whenever you forgive sins, they are
forgiven. Whenever you don’t forgive
them, they are not forgiven."
24 Thomas, one of the twelve apostles,
who was called Didymus, wasn’t with
them when Jesus came.
25 The other disciples told him, "We’ve
seen the Lord." Thomas told them, "I
refuse to believe this unless I see the nail
marks in his hands, put my ﬁngers into
them, and put my hand into his side."
26 A week later Jesus’ disciples were
again in the house, and Thomas wasJOHN 20 – 21
134
with them. Even though the doors were
locked, Jesus stood among them and
said, "Peace be with you!"
27 Then Jesus said to Thomas, "Put your
ﬁnger here, and look at my hands. Take
your hand, and put it into my side. Stop
doub ng, and believe."
28 Thomas responded to Jesus, "My
Lord and my God!"
29 Jesus said to Thomas, "You believe
because you’ve seen me. Blessed are
those who haven’t seen me but believe."
30 Jesus performed many other miracles
that his disciples saw. Those miracles are
not wri en in this book.
31 But these miracles have been wri en
so that you will believe that Jesus is the
Messiah, the Son of God, and so that
you will have life by believing in him.
1 Later, by the Sea of Tiberias,
Jesus showed himself again to
the disciples. This is what happened.
21JOHN 21
135
2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called
Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in
Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other
disciples of Jesus were together.
3 Simon Peter said to the others, "I’m
going ﬁshing." They told him, "We’re
going with you." They went out in a boat
but didn’t catch a thing that night.
4 As the sun was rising, Jesus stood on
the shore. The disciples didn’t realize
that it was Jesus.
5 Jesus asked them, "Friends, haven’t
you caught any ﬁsh?" They answered
him, "No, we haven’t."
6 He told them, "Throw the net out on
the right side of the boat, and you’ll
catch some." So they threw the net out
and were unable to pull it in because so
many ﬁsh were in it.
7 The disciple whom Jesus loved said to
Peter, "It’s the Lord." When Simon Peter
heard that it was the Lord, he put backJOHN 21
136
on the clothes that he had taken oﬀ and
jumped into the sea.
8 The other disciples came with the
boat and dragged the net full of ﬁsh.
They weren’t far from the shore, only
about 100 yards.
9 When they went ashore, they saw a
ﬁre with a ﬁsh lying on the coals, and
they saw a loaf of bread.
10 Jesus told them, "Bring some of the
ﬁsh you’ve just caught."
11 Simon Peter got into the boat and
pulled the net ashore. Though the net
was ﬁlled with 153 large ﬁsh, it was not
torn.
12 Jesus told them, "Come, have
breakfast." None of the disciples dared
to ask him who he was. They knew he
was the Lord.
13 Jesus took the bread, gave it to them,
and did the same with the ﬁsh.JOHN 21
14 This was the third
137
me that Jesus
showed himself to the disciples a er he
had come back to life.
15 A er they had eaten breakfast, Jesus
asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John,
do you love me more than the other
disciples do?" Peter answered him, "Yes,
Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus
told him, "Feed my lambs."
16 Jesus asked him again, a second me,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you
know that I love you." Jesus told him,
"Take care of my sheep."
17 Jesus asked him a third me, "Simon,
son of John, do you love me?" Peter felt
sad because Jesus had asked him a third
me, "Do you love me?" So Peter said
to him, "Lord, you know everything. You
know that I love you." Jesus told him,
"Feed my sheep.JOHN 21
138
18 I can guarantee this truth: When you
were young, you would get ready to go
where you wanted. But when you’re
old, you will stretch out your hands, and
someone else will get you ready to take
you where you don’t want to go."
19 Jesus said this to show by what kind
of death Peter would bring glory to
God. A er saying this, Jesus told Peter,
"Follow me!"
20 Peter turned around and saw the
disciple whom Jesus loved. That disciple
was following them. He was the one
who leaned against Jesus’ chest at the
supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to
betray you?"
21 When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus,
"Lord, what about him?"
22 Jesus said to Peter, "If I want him to
live un l I come again, how does that
concern you? Follow me!"JOHN 21
139
23 So a rumor that that disciple wouldn’t
die spread among Jesus’ followers. But
Jesus didn’t say that he wouldn’t die.
What Jesus said was, "If I want him to
live un l I come again, how does that
concern you?"
24 This disciple was an eyewitness of
these things and wrote them down. We
know that what he says is true.
25 Jesus also did many other things. If
every one of them were wri en down,
I suppose the world wouldn’t have
enough room for the books that would
be wri en.Acts of the Apostles
1
1 In my ﬁrst book, Theophilus, I wrote
about what Jesus began to do and
teach. This included everything from the
beginning of his life
2 un l the day he was taken to heaven.
Before he was taken to heaven, he gave
instruc ons through the Holy Spirit to
the apostles, whom he had chosen.
3 A er his death Jesus showed the
apostles a lot of convincing evidence that
he was alive. For 40 days he appeared
to them and talked with them about the
kingdom of God.
4 Once, while he was mee ng with
them, he ordered them not to leave
Jerusalem but to wait there for what the
Father had promised. Jesus said to them,
"I’ve told you what the Father promises:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5 John bap
2
zed with water, but in a few
days you will be bap zed with the Holy
Spirit."
6 So when the apostles came together,
they asked him, "Lord, is this the
me when you’re going to restore the
kingdom to Israel?"
7 Jesus told them, "You don’t need
to know about mes or periods that
the Father has determined by his own
authority.
8 But you will receive power when the
Holy Spirit comes to you. Then you will
be my witnesses to tes fy about me
in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
9 A er he had said this, he was taken
to heaven. A cloud hid him so that they
could no longer see him.
10 They were staring into the sky as he
departed. Suddenly, two men in white
clothes stood near them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
3
11 They asked, "Why are you men from
Galilee standing here looking at the
sky? Jesus, who was taken from you to
heaven, will come back in the same way
that you saw him go to heaven."
12 Then they returned to Jerusalem
from the mountain called the Mount of
Olives. It is near Jerusalem, about half a
mile away.
13 When they came into the city, Peter,
John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas,
Bartholomew, Ma hew, James (son of
Alphaeus), Simon the Zealot, and Judas
(son of James) went to the second–story
room where they were staying.
14 The apostles had a single purpose as
they devoted themselves to prayer. They
were joined by some women, including
Mary (the mother of Jesus), and they
were joined by his brothers.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
15 At a
4
me when about 120 disciples
had gathered together, Peter got up and
spoke to them. He said,
16 "Brothers, what the Holy Spirit
predicted through David in Scripture
about Judas had to come true. Judas led
the men to arrest Jesus.
17 He had been one of us and had been
given an ac ve role in this ministry.
18 With the money he received from
the wrong he had done, he bought a
piece of land where he fell headﬁrst to
his death. His body split open, and all his
internal organs came out.
19 Everyone living in Jerusalem knows
about this. They even call that piece of
land Akeldama, which means ‘Field of
Blood’ in their dialect.
20 You’ve read in Psalms, ‘Let his home
be deserted, and let no one live there,’
and ‘Let someone else take his posi on.’"
"Therefore, someone must be added toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5
our number to serve with us as a witness
that Jesus came back to life.
21 He must be one of the men who
accompanied Jesus with us the en re
me that the Lord Jesus was among us.
22 This person must have been with us
from the me that John was bap zing
people to the day that Jesus was taken
from us."
23 The disciples determined that two
men were qualiﬁed. These men were
Joseph (who was called Barsabbas and
was also known as Justus) and Ma hias.
24 Then they prayed, "Lord, you know
everyone’s thoughts. Show us which of
these two you have chosen.
25 Show us who is to take the place
of Judas as an apostle, since Judas
abandoned his posi on to go to the
place where he belongs."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1 – 2
6
26 They drew names to choose an
apostle. Ma hias was chosen and joined
the eleven apostles.
1 When Pentecost, the ﬁ ieth day
a er Passover, came, all the believers
were together in one place.
2 Suddenly, a sound like a violently
blowing wind came from the sky and
ﬁlled the whole house where they were
staying.
3 Tongues that looked like ﬁre appeared
to them. The tongues arranged
themselves so that one came to rest on
each believer.
4 All the believers were ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit and began to speak in other
languages as the Spirit gave them the
ability to speak.
5 Devout Jewish men from every na on
were living in Jerusalem.
6 They gathered when they heard
the wind. Each person was startled to
2ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
7
recognize his own dialect when the
disciples spoke.
7 Stunned and amazed, the people in
the crowd said, "All of these men who
are speaking are Galileans.
8 Why do we hear them speaking in our
na ve dialects?
9 We’re Parthians, Medes, and Elamites.
We’re people from Mesopotamia, Judea,
Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of
Asia,
10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the
country near Cyrene in Libya. We’re
Jewish people, converts to Judaism, and
visitors from Rome,
11 Crete, and Arabia. We hear these
men in our own languages as they tell
about the miracles that God has done."
12 All of these devout men were
stunned and puzzled. They asked each
other, "What can this mean?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
8
13 Others said jokingly, "They’re drunk
on sweet wine."
14 Then Peter stood up with the eleven
apostles. In a loud voice he said to them,
"Men of Judea and everyone living in
Jerusalem! You must understand this, so
pay a en on to what I say.
15 These men are not drunk as you
suppose. It’s only nine in the morning.
16 Rather, this is what the prophet Joel
spoke about:
17 ’In the last days, God says, I will
pour my Spirit on everyone. Your sons
and daughters will speak what God
has revealed. Your young men will see
visions. Your old men will dream dreams.
18 In those days I will pour my Spirit on
my servants, on both men and women.
They will speak what God has revealed.
19 I will work miracles in the sky and
give signs on the earth: blood, ﬁre, and
clouds of smoke.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
9
20 The sun will become dark, and the
moon will become as red as blood before
the terrifying day of the Lord comes.
21 Then whoever calls on the name of
the Lord will be saved.’
22 "Men of Israel, listen to what I say:
Jesus from Nazareth was a man whom
God brought to your a en on. You
know that through this man God worked
miracles, did amazing things, and gave
signs.
23 By using men who don’t acknowledge
Moses’ Teachings, you cruciﬁed Jesus,
who was given over to death by a plan
that God had determined in advance.
24 But God raised him from death to
life and destroyed the pains of death,
because death had no power to hold
him.
25 This is what David meant when he
said about Jesus: ‘I always see the Lord inACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
10
front of me. I cannot be moved because
he is by my side.
26 That is why my heart is glad and
my tongue rejoices. My body also rests
securely
27 because you do not abandon my soul
to the grave or allow your holy one to
decay.
28 You make the path of life known to
me. In your presence there is complete
joy.’
29 "Brothers, I can tell you conﬁdently
that our ancestor David died and was
buried and that his tomb is here to this
day.
30 David was a prophet and knew that
God had promised with an oath that he
would place one of David’s descendants
on his throne.
31 David knew that the Messiah would
come back to life, and he spoke about
that before it ever happened. He saidACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
11
that the Messiah wouldn’t be le in the
grave and that his body wouldn’t decay.
32 "God brought this man Jesus back to
life. We are all witnesses to that.
33 God used his power to give Jesus the
highest posi on. Jesus has also received
and has poured out the Holy Spirit as the
Father had promised, and this is what
you’re seeing and hearing.
34 David didn’t go up to heaven, but he
said, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, "Take my
highest posi on of power
35 un l I put your enemies under your
control."’
36 "All the people of Israel should know
beyond a doubt that God made Jesus,
whom you cruciﬁed, both Lord and
Christ."
37 When the people heard this, they
were deeply upset. They asked Peter
and the other apostles, "Brothers, what
should we do?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
12
38 Peter answered them, "All of you
must turn to God and change the way
you think and act, and each of you must
be bap zed in the name of Jesus Christ
so that your sins will be forgiven. Then
you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gi .
39 This promise belongs to you and to
your children and to everyone who is
far away. It belongs to everyone who
worships the Lord our God."
40 Peter said much more to warn them.
He urged, "Save yourselves from this
corrupt genera on."
41 Those who accepted what Peter said
were bap zed. That day about 3,000
people were added to the group.
42 The disciples were devoted to the
teachings of the apostles, to fellowship,
to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.
43 A feeling of fear came over everyone
as many amazing things and miraculous
signs happened through the apostles.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2 – 3
44 All the believers kept mee
13
ng
together, and they shared everything
with each other.
45 From me to me, they sold their
property and other possessions and
distributed the money to anyone who
needed it.
46 The believers had a single purpose
and went to the temple every day. They
were joyful and humble as they ate at
each other’s homes and shared their
food.
47 At the same me, they praised God
and had the good will of all the people.
Every day the Lord saved people, and
they were added to the group.
1 Peter and John were going to
the temple courtyard for the three
o’clock prayer.
2 At the same me, a man who had
been lame from birth was being carried
by some men. Every day these men
3ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
14
would put the lame man at a gate in the
temple courtyard. The gate was called
Beau ful Gate. There he would beg for
handouts from people going into the
courtyard.
3 When the man saw that Peter
and John were about to go into the
courtyard, he asked them for a handout.
4 Peter and John stared at him. "Look at
us!" Peter said.
5 So the man watched them closely.
He expected to receive something from
them.
6 However, Peter said to him, "I don’t
have any money, but I’ll give you what
I do have. Through the power of Jesus
Christ from Nazareth, walk!"
7 Peter took hold of the man’s right
hand and began to help him up.
Immediately, the man’s feet and ankles
became strong.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
15
8 Springing to his feet, he stood up and
started to walk. He went with Peter and
John into the temple courtyard. The man
was walking, jumping, and praising God.
9 All the people saw him walking and
praising God.
10 They knew that he was the man
who used to sit and beg at the temple’s
Beau ful Gate. The people were amazed
and stunned to see what had happened
to him.
11 They were excited, and everyone
ran to see them at the place called
Solomon’s Porch. The man wouldn’t let
go of Peter and John.
12 When Peter saw this, he said to the
people, "Men of Israel, why are you
amazed about this man? Why are you
staring at us as though we have made
him walk by our own power or godly
life?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
16
13 The God of our ancestors Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob has gloriﬁed his servant
Jesus. You handed Jesus over to Pilate.
You rejected him in Pilate’s presence,
even though Pilate had decided to let
him go free.
14 You rejected the man who was
holy and innocent. You asked to have a
murderer given to you,
15 and you killed the source of life. But
God brought him back to life, and we are
witnesses to that.
16 We believe in the one named Jesus.
Through his power alone this man,
whom you know, was healed, as all of
you saw.
17 "And now, brothers, I know that like
your rulers you didn’t know what you
were doing.
18 But in this way God made the
suﬀerings of his Messiah come true. GodACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
17
had predicted these suﬀerings through
all the prophets.
19 So change the way you think and
act, and turn to God to have your sins
removed.
20 Then mes will come when the Lord
will refresh you. He will send you Jesus,
whom he has appointed to be the Christ.
21 Heaven must receive Jesus un l the
me when everything will be restored as
God promised through his holy prophets
long ago.
22 "Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will
send you a prophet, an Israelite like me.
Listen to everything he tells you.
23 Those who won’t listen to that
prophet will be excluded from the
people.’
24 Samuel and all the prophets who
followed him spoke about these days.
25 You are the descendants of the
prophets and the heirs of the promiseACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3 – 4
18
that God made to our ancestors when
he said to Abraham, ‘Through your
descendant all people on earth will be
blessed.’
26 God has brought his servant back to
life and has sent him to you ﬁrst. God did
this to bless you by turning every one of
you from your evil ways."
1 Some priests, the oﬃcer in charge
of the temple guards, and some
Sadducees approached Peter and John
while they were speaking to the people.
2 These religious authori es were
greatly annoyed. Peter and John were
teaching the people and spreading the
message that the dead will come back to
life through Jesus.
3 So the temple guards arrested them.
Since it was already evening, they put
Peter and John in jail un l the next day.
4 But many of those who had heard
the message became believers, so the
4ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
19
number of men who believed grew to
about 5,000.
5 The next day the Jewish rulers,
leaders, and scribes met in Jerusalem.
6 The chief priest Annas, Caiaphas,
John, Alexander, and the rest of the chief
priest’s family were present.
7 They made Peter and John stand in
front of them and then asked, "By what
power or in whose name did you do
this?"
8 Then Peter, because he was ﬁlled with
the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and
leaders of the people,
9 today you are cross–examining us
about the good we did for a crippled
man. You want to know how he was
made well.
10 You and all the people of Israel must
understand that this man stands in your
presence with a healthy body because of
the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
20
You cruciﬁed Jesus Christ, but God has
brought him back to life.
11 He is the stone that the builders
rejected, the stone that has become the
cornerstone.
12 No one else can save us. Indeed, we
can be saved only by the power of the
one named Jesus and not by any other
person."
13 A er they found out that Peter
and John had no educa on or special
training, they were surprised to see how
boldly they spoke. They realized that
these men had been with Jesus.
14 When they saw the man who was
healed standing with Peter and John,
they couldn’t say anything against the
two apostles.
15 So they ordered Peter and John to
leave the council room and began to
discuss the ma er among themselves.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
21
16 They said, "What should we do to
these men? Clearly, they’ve performed
a miracle that everyone in Jerusalem
knows about. We can’t deny that.
17 So let’s threaten them. Let’s tell them
that they must never speak to anyone
about the one named Jesus. Then the
news about the miracle that they have
performed will not spread any further
among the people."
18 They called Peter and John and
ordered them never to teach about
Jesus or even men on his name.
19 Peter and John answered them,
"Decide for yourselves whether God
wants people to listen to you rather than
to him.
20 We cannot stop talking about what
we’ve seen and heard."
21 The authori es threatened them
even more and then let them go. Since
all the people were praising God forACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
22
what had happened, the authori es
couldn’t ﬁnd any way to punish Peter
and John.
22 (The man who was healed by this
miracle was over 40 years old.)
23 When Peter and John were released,
they went to the other apostles and told
them everything the chief priests and
leaders had said.
24 When the apostles heard this, they
were united and loudly prayed to God,
"Master, you made the sky, the land, the
sea, and everything in them.
25 You said through the Holy Spirit,
who spoke through your servant David
(our ancestor), ‘Why do the na ons act
arrogantly? Why do their people devise
useless plots?
26 Kings take their stand. Rulers make
plans together against the Lord and
against his Messiah.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
27 "In this city Herod and Pon
23
us Pilate
made plans together with non–Jewish
people and the people of Israel. They
made their plans against your holy
servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
28 Through your will and power, they
did everything that you had already
decided should be done.
29 "Lord, pay a en on to their threats
now, and allow us to speak your word
boldly.
30 Show your power by healing,
performing miracles, and doing amazing
things through the power and the name
of your holy servant Jesus."
31 When the apostles had ﬁnished
praying, their mee ng place shook. All
of them were ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit
and con nued to speak the word of God
boldly.
32 The whole group of believers lived
in harmony. No one called any of hisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4 – 5
24
possessions his own. Instead, they
shared everything.
33 With great power the apostles
con nued to tes fy that the Lord Jesus
had come back to life. God’s abundant
good will was with all of them.
34 None of them needed anything.
From me to me, people sold land or
houses and brought the money
35 to the apostles. Then the money was
distributed to anyone who needed it.
36 Joseph, a descendant of Levi, had
been born on the island of Cyprus. The
apostles called him Barnabas, which
means "a person who encourages."
37 He had some land. He sold it and
turned the money over to the apostles.
1 A man named Ananias and his wife
Sapphira sold some property.
2 They agreed to hold back some of the
money they had pledged and turned
only part of it over to the apostles.
5ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
25
3 Peter asked, "Ananias, why did you
let Satan ﬁll you with the idea that you
could deceive the Holy Spirit? You’ve
held back some of the money you
received for the land.
4 While you had the land, it was your
own. A er it was sold, you could have
done as you pleased with the money. So
how could you do a thing like this? You
didn’t lie to people but to God!"
5 When Ananias heard Peter say this,
he dropped dead. Everyone who heard
about his death was terriﬁed.
6 Some young men got up, wrapped his
body in a sheet, carried him outside, and
buried him.
7 About three hours later Ananias’
wife arrived. She didn’t know what had
happened.
8 So Peter asked her, "Tell me, did
you sell the land for that price?" She
answered, "Yes, that was the price."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
26
9 Then Peter said to her, "How could
you and your husband agree to test the
Lord’s Spirit? Those who buried your
husband are standing at the door, and
they will carry you outside for burial."
10 Immediately, she dropped dead in
front of Peter. When the young men
came back, they found Sapphira dead.
So they carried her outside and buried
her next to her husband.
11 The whole church and everyone else
who heard about what had happened
were terriﬁed.
12 The people saw the apostles perform
many miracles and do amazing things.
The believers had a common faith in
Jesus as they met on Solomon’s Porch.
13 None of the other people dared to
join them, although everyone spoke
highly of them.
14 More men and women than ever
began to believe in the Lord.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
27
15 As a result, people carried their
sick into the streets. They placed them
on stretchers and cots so that at least
Peter’s shadow might fall on some sick
people as he went by.
16 Crowds from the ci es around
Jerusalem would gather. They would
bring their sick and those who were
troubled by evil spirits, and each person
was cured.
17 The chief priest and the whole party
of the Sadducees who were with him
were extremely jealous. So they took
ac on
18 by arres ng the apostles and pu ng
them in the city jail.
19 But at night an angel from the Lord
opened the doors to their cell and led
them out of the prison.
20 The angel told them, "Stand in the
temple courtyard, and tell the people
everything about life in Christ."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
21 Early in the morning, a
28
er they had
listened to the angel, the apostles went
into the temple courtyard and began to
teach. The chief priest and those who
were with him called together the Jewish
council, that is, all the leaders of Israel.
They also sent men to the prison to get
the apostles.
22 When the temple guards arrived at
the prison, they didn’t ﬁnd the apostles.
The guards came back and reported,
23 "We found the prison securely locked
and the guards standing at the doors.
However, when we opened the doors,
we found no one inside."
24 When the oﬃcer of the temple
guards and the chief priests heard this,
they were puzzled about what could
have happened.
25 Then someone told them, "The men
you put in prison are standing in theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
29
temple courtyard. They’re teaching the
people."
26 Then the oﬃcer of the temple guards
went with some of his men to bring back
the apostles without using force. A er
all, the oﬃcer and his guards were afraid
that the people would stone them to
death for using force.
27 When they brought back the
apostles, they made them stand in
front of the council. The chief priest
ques oned them.
28 He said, "We gave you strict orders
not to men on Jesus’ name when you
teach. Yet, you’ve ﬁlled Jerusalem with
your teachings. You want to take revenge
on us for pu ng that man to death."
29 Peter and the other apostles
answered, "We must obey God rather
than people.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
30
30 You murdered Jesus by hanging him
on a cross. But the God of our ancestors
brought him back to life.
31 God used his power to give Jesus the
highest posi on as leader and savior. He
did this to lead the people of Israel to
him, to change the way they think and
act, and to forgive their sins.
32 We are witnesses to these things,
and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has
given to those who obey him."
33 When the men on the council heard
this, they became furious and wanted to
execute the apostles.
34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel stood
up. He was a highly respected expert in
Moses’ Teachings. He ordered that the
apostles should be taken outside for a
li le while.
35 Then he said to the council, "Men of
Israel, consider carefully what you do
with these men.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
36 Some
31
me ago Theudas appeared.
He claimed that he was important, and
about four hundred men joined him.
He was killed, and all his followers were
sca ered. The whole movement was a
failure.
37 "A er that man, at the me of the
census, Judas from Galilee appeared and
led people in a revolt. He, too, died, and
all his followers were sca ered.
38 "We should keep away from these
men for now. We should leave them
alone. I can guarantee that if the plan
they put into ac on is of human origin, it
will fail.
39 However, if it’s from God, you won’t
be able to stop them. You may even
discover that you’re ﬁgh ng against
God."
40 The council took his advice. They
called the apostles, beat them, orderedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5 – 6
32
them not to speak about the one named
Jesus, and let them go.
41 The apostles le the council
room. They were happy to have been
considered worthy to suﬀer dishonor for
speaking about Jesus.
42 Every day in the temple courtyard
and from house to house, they refused
to stop teaching and telling the Good
News that Jesus is the Messiah.
1 At that me, as the number of
disciples grew, Greek–speaking Jews
complained about the Hebrew–speaking
Jews. The Greek–speaking Jews claimed
that the widows among them were
neglected every day when food and
other assistance was distributed.
2 The twelve apostles called all the
disciples together and told them, "It’s
not right for us to give up God’s word in
order to distribute food.
6ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
33
3 So, brothers and sisters, choose
seven men whom the people know are
spiritually wise. We will put them in
charge of this problem.
4 However, we will devote ourselves to
praying and to serving in ways that are
related to the word."
5 The sugges on pleased the whole
group. So they chose Stephen, who
was a man full of faith and the Holy
Spirit, and they chose Philip, Prochorus,
Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus,
who had converted to Judaism in the
city of An och.
6 The disciples had these men stand in
front of the apostles, who prayed and
placed their hands on these seven men.
7 The word of God con nued to spread,
and the number of disciples in Jerusalem
grew very large. A large number of
priests accepted the faith.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
34
8 Stephen was a man ﬁlled with God’s
favor and power. He did amazing things
and performed miracles.
9 One day some men from the ci es
of Cyrene and Alexandria and the
provinces of Cilicia and Asia started an
argument with Stephen. They belonged
to a synagogue called Freedmen’s
Synagogue.
10 They couldn’t argue with Stephen
because he spoke with the wisdom that
the Spirit had given him.
11 Then they bribed some men to lie.
These men said, "We heard him slander
Moses and God."
12 The liars s rred up trouble among
the people, the leaders, and the scribes.
So they went to Stephen, took him by
force, and brought him in front of the
Jewish council.
13 Some witnesses stood up and lied
about Stephen. They said, "This manACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6 – 7
35
never stops saying bad things about the
holy place and Moses’ Teachings.
14 We heard him say that Jesus from
Nazareth will destroy the temple and
change the customs that Moses gave
us."
15 Everyone who sat in the council
stared at him and saw that his face
looked like an angel’s face.
1 Then the chief priest asked
Stephen, "Is this true?"
2 Stephen answered, "Brothers and
fathers, listen to me. The God who
reveals his glory appeared to our
ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia.
This happened before Abraham lived in
Haran.
3 God told him, ‘Leave your land and
your rela ves. Go to the land that I will
show you.’
4 "Then Abraham le the country of
Chaldea and lived in the city of Haran.
7ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
36
A er his father died, God made him
move from there to this land where we
now live.
5 "Yet, God didn’t give Abraham
anything in this land to call his own, not
even a place to rest his feet. But God
promised to give this land to him and to
his descendants, even though Abraham
didn’t have a child.
6 God told Abraham that his
descendants would be foreigners
living in another country and that the
people there would make them slaves
and mistreat them for 400 years.
7 God also told him, ‘I will punish the
people whom they will serve. A er that,
they will leave that country and worship
me here.’
8 "God gave Abraham circumcision
to conﬁrm his promise. So when
Abraham’s son Isaac was born, Abraham
circumcised him on the eighth day. IsaacACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
37
did the same to his son Jacob, and Jacob
did the same to his twelve sons (the
ancestors of our tribes).
9 "Jacob’s sons were jealous of their
brother Joseph. They sold him into
slavery, and he was taken to Egypt. But
God was with Joseph
10 and rescued him from all his
suﬀering. When Joseph stood in the
presence of Pharaoh (the king of Egypt),
God gave Joseph divine favor and
wisdom so that he became ruler of Egypt
and of Pharaoh’s whole palace.
11 Then a famine throughout Egypt and
Canaan brought a lot of suﬀering. Our
ancestors couldn’t ﬁnd any food.
12 When Jacob heard that Egypt had
food, he sent our ancestors there. That
was their ﬁrst trip.
13 On the second trip, Joseph told his
brothers who he was, and Pharaoh
learned about Joseph’s family.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
38
14 Joseph sent for his father Jacob and
his rela ves, 75 people in all.
15 So Jacob went to Egypt, and he and
our ancestors died there.
16 They were taken to Shechem for
burial in the tomb that Abraham
purchased in Shechem from Hamor’s
sons.
17 "When the me that God had
promised to Abraham had almost come,
the number of our people in Egypt had
grown very large.
18 Then a diﬀerent king, who knew
nothing about Joseph, began to rule in
Egypt.
19 This king was shrewd in the way
he took advantage of our people. He
mistreated our ancestors. He made
them abandon their newborn babies
outdoors, where they would die.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
20 "At that
39
me Moses was born, and
he was a very beau ful child. His parents
took care of him for three months.
21 When Moses was abandoned
outdoors, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted
him and raised him as her son.
22 So Moses was educated in all the
wisdom of the Egyp ans and became a
great man in what he said and did.
23 When he was 40 years old, he
decided to visit his own people, the
Israelites.
24 When he saw an Israelite man being
treated unfairly by an Egyp an, he
defended the Israelite. He took revenge
by killing the Egyp an.
25 Moses thought his own people would
understand that God was going to use
him to give them freedom. But they
didn’t understand.
26 The next day Moses saw two
Israelites ﬁgh ng, and he tried to makeACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
40
peace between them. He said to them,
‘Men, you are brothers. Why are you
trea ng each other unfairly?’
27 "But one of the men pushed Moses
aside. He asked Moses, ‘Who made you
our ruler and judge?
28 Do you want to kill me as you killed
the Egyp an yesterday?’
29 A er he said that, Moses quickly le
Egypt and lived in Midian as a foreigner.
In Midian he fathered two sons.
30 "Forty years later, a messenger
appeared to him in the ﬂames of a
burning bush in the desert of Mount
Sinai.
31 Moses was surprised when he saw
this. As he went closer to look at the
bush, the voice of the Lord said to him,
32 ’I am the God of your ancestors––the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’
Moses began to tremble and didn’t dare
to look at the bush.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
41
33 The Lord told him, ‘Take oﬀ your
sandals. The place where you’re standing
is holy ground.
34 I’ve seen how my people are
mistreated in Egypt. I’ve heard their
groaning and have come to rescue them.
So now I’m sending you to Egypt.’
35 "This is the Moses whom the
Israelites rejected by saying, ‘Who made
you our ruler and judge?’ This is the one
God sent to free them and to rule them
with the help of the messenger who
appeared to him in the bush.
36 This is the man who led our ancestors
out of Egypt. He is the person who did
amazing things and worked miracles in
Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the desert
for 40 years.
37 This is the same Moses who told the
Israelites, ‘God will send you a prophet,
an Israelite like me.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
42
38 This is the Moses who was in the
assembly in the desert. Our ancestors
and the messenger who spoke to him on
Mount Sinai were there with him. Moses
received life–giving messages to give to
us,
39 but our ancestors were not willing
to obey him. Instead, they pushed him
aside, and in their hearts they turned
back to Egypt.
40 They told Aaron, ‘We don’t know
what has happened to this Moses, who
led us out of Egypt. So make gods who
will lead us.’
41 That was the me they made a calf.
They oﬀered a sacriﬁce to that false god
and delighted in what they had made.
42 "So God turned away from them and
let them worship the sun, moon, and
stars. This is wri en in the book of the
prophets: ‘Did you bring me sacriﬁcesACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
43
and grain oﬀerings in the desert for 40
years, na on of Israel?
43 You carried along the shrine of
Moloch, the star of the god Rephan, and
the statues you made for yourselves to
worship. I will send you into exile beyond
the city of Babylon.’
44 "In the desert our ancestors had the
tent of God’s promise. Moses built this
tent exactly as God had told him. He
used the model he had seen.
45 A er our ancestors received the tent,
they brought it into this land. They did
this with Joshua’s help when they took
possession of the land from the na ons
that God forced out of our ancestors’
way. This tent remained here un l the
me of David,
46 who won God’s favor. David asked
that he might provide a permanent place
for the family of Jacob.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
44
47 But Solomon was the one who built a
house for God.
48 "However, the Most High doesn’t
live in a house built by humans, as the
prophet says:
49 ’The Lord says, "Heaven is my throne.
The earth is my footstool. What kind of
house are you going to build for me?
Where will I rest?
50 Didn’t I make all these things?"’
51 "How stubborn can you be? How can
you be so heartless and disobedient?
You’re just like your ancestors. They
always opposed the Holy Spirit, and so
do you!
52 Was there ever a prophet your
ancestors didn’t persecute? They killed
those who predicted that a man with
God’s approval would come. You have
now become the people who betrayed
and murdered that man.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
45
53 You are the people who received
Moses’ Teachings, which were put into
eﬀect by angels. But you haven’t obeyed
those teachings."
54 As council members listened to
Stephen, they became no ceably
furious.
55 But Stephen was full of the Holy
Spirit. He looked into heaven, saw
God’s glory, and Jesus in the posi on of
authority that God gives.
56 So Stephen said, "Look, I see heaven
opened and the Son of Man in the
posi on of authority that God has given
him!"
57 But the council members shouted
and refused to listen. Then they rushed
at Stephen with one purpose in mind,
58 and a er they had thrown him out
of the city, they began to stone him to
death. The witnesses le their coats
with a young man named Saul.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7 – 8
46
59 While council members were
execu ng Stephen, he called out, "Lord
Jesus, welcome my spirit."
60 Then he knelt down and shouted,
"Lord, don’t hold this sin against them."
A er he had said this, he died.
1 Saul approved of pu ng Stephen
to death. On that day widespread
persecu on broke out against the church
in Jerusalem. Most believers, except the
apostles, were sca ered throughout
Judea and Samaria.
2 Devout men buried Stephen as they
mourned loudly for him.
3 Saul tried to destroy the church. He
dragged men and women out of one
home a er another and threw them into
prison.
4 The believers who were sca ered
went from place to place, where they
spread the word.

5 Philip went to the city of Samaria and
told people about the Messiah.
6 The crowds paid close a en on to
what Philip said. They listened to him
and saw the miracles that he performed.
7 Evil spirits screamed as they came out
of the many people they had possessed.
Many paralyzed and lame people were
cured.
8 As a result, that city was extremely
happy.
9 A man named Simon lived in that city.
He amazed the people of Samaria with
his prac ce of magic. He claimed that he
was great.
10 Everyone from children to adults paid
a en on to him. They said, "This man
is the power of God, and that power is
called great."
11 They paid a en on to Simon because
he had amazed them for a long me
with his prac ce of magic.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
48
12 However, when Philip spread the
Good News about the kingdom of God
and the one named Jesus Christ, men
and women believed him and were
bap zed.
13 Even Simon believed, and a er he
was bap zed, he became devoted to
Philip. Simon was amazed to see the
miracles and impressive things that were
happening.
14 When the apostles in Jerusalem
heard that the Samaritans had accepted
the word of God, they sent Peter and
John to them.
15 Peter and John went to Samaria
and prayed that the Samaritans would
receive the Holy Spirit.
16 (Before this the Holy Spirit had not
come to any of the Samaritans. They had
only been bap zed in the name of the
Lord Jesus.)ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
49
17 Then Peter and John placed their
hands on them, and the Samaritans
received the Holy Spirit.
18 Simon saw that the Spirit was given
to the Samaritans when the apostles
placed their hands on them. So he
oﬀered Peter and John money
19 and said, "Give me this power so that
anyone I place my hands on will receive
the Holy Spirit."
20 Peter told Simon, "May your money
be destroyed with you because you
thought you could buy God’s gi .
21 You won’t have any share in this
because God can see how twisted your
thinking is.
22 So change your wicked thoughts, and
ask the Lord if he will forgive you for
thinking like this.
23 I can see that you are bi er with
jealousy and wrapped up in your evil
ways."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
50
24 Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord
for me that none of the things you said
will happen to me."
25 A er they had boldly spoken about
the message of the Lord, they spread the
Good News in many Samaritan villages
on their way back to Jerusalem.
26 An angel from the Lord said to Philip,
"Get up, and take the desert road that
goes south from Jerusalem to Gaza."
27 So Philip went. An Ethiopian man
who had come to Jerusalem to worship
was on his way home. The man was a
eunuch, a high–ranking oﬃcial in charge
of all the treasures of Queen Candace of
Ethiopia.
28 As the oﬃcial rode along in his
carriage, he was reading the prophet
Isaiah out loud.
29 The Spirit said to Philip, "Go to that
carriage, and stay close to it."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
51
30 Philip ran to the carriage and could
hear the oﬃcial reading the prophet
Isaiah out loud. Philip asked him, "Do
you understand what you’re reading?"
31 The oﬃcial answered, "How can
I understand unless someone guides
me?" So he invited Philip to sit with him
in his carriage.
32 This was the part of the Scriptures
that the oﬃcial was reading: "He was led
like a lamb to the slaughter. He was like
a sheep that is silent when its wool is cut
oﬀ. He didn’t open his mouth.
33 When he humbled himself, he
was not judged fairly. Who from his
genera on will talk about his life on
earth being cut short?"
34 The oﬃcial said to Philip, "I would
like to know who the prophet is talking
about. Is he talking about himself or
someone else?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
35 Then Philip spoke. Star
52
ng with that
passage, Philip told the oﬃcial the Good
News about Jesus.
36 As they were going along the road,
they came to some water. The oﬃcial
said to Philip, "Look, there’s some
water. What can keep me from being
bap zed?"
37 (OMITTED TEXT)
38 The oﬃcial ordered the carriage to
stop. He and Philip stepped into the
water, and Philip bap zed him.
39 When they had stepped out of the
water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly
took Philip away. The oﬃcial joyfully
con nued on his way and didn’t see
Philip again.

Azotus. He traveled through all the ci es

1 Saul kept threatening to murder
the Lord’s disciples. He went to the
chief priest
2 and asked him to write le ers of
authoriza on to the synagogue leaders
in the city of Damascus. Saul wanted to
arrest any man or woman who followed
the way of Christ and imprison them in
Jerusalem.
3 As Saul was coming near the city of
Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly
ﬂashed around him.
4 He fell to the ground and heard a

him were speechless. They heard the
voice but didn’t see anyone.
8 Saul was helped up from the ground.
When he opened his eyes, he was
blind. So his companions led him into
Damascus.
9 For three days he couldn’t see and
didn’t eat or drink.
10 A disciple named Ananias lived in the
city of Damascus. The Lord said to him in
a vision, "Ananias!" Ananias answered,
"Yes, Lord."
11 The Lord told him, "Get up! Go to
Judas’ house on Straight Street, and ask
for a man named Saul from the city of
Tarsus. He’s praying.
12 In a vision he has seen a man named
Ananias place his hands on him to
restore his sight."
13 Ananias replied, "Lord, I’ve heard a
lot of people tell about the many evilACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
55
things this man has done to your people
in Jerusalem.
14 Saul has come here to Damascus
with authority from the chief priests to
put anyone who calls on your name in
prison."
15 The Lord told Ananias, "Go! I’ve
chosen this man to bring my name to
na ons, to kings, and to the people of
Israel.
16 I’ll show him how much he has to
suﬀer for the sake of my name."
17 Ananias le and entered Judas’
house. A er he placed his hands on Saul,
Ananias said, "Brother Saul, the Lord
Jesus, who appeared to you on your way
to Damascus, sent me to you. He wants
you to see again and to be ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit."
18 Immediately, something like ﬁsh
scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he couldACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
56
see again. Then Saul stood up and was
bap zed.
19 A er he had something to eat, his
strength came back to him. Saul was
with the disciples in the city of Damascus
for several days.
20 He immediately began to spread the
word in their synagogues that Jesus was
the Son of God.
21 Everyone who heard him was
amazed. They asked, "Isn’t this the man
who destroyed those who worshiped the
one named Jesus in Jerusalem? Didn’t
he come here to take these worshipers
as prisoners to the chief priests in
Jerusalem?"
22 Saul grew more powerful, and he
confused the Jews living in Damascus by
proving that Jesus was the Messiah.
23 Later the Jews planned to murder
Saul,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
57
24 but Saul was told about their plot.
They were watching the city gates day
and night in order to murder him.
25 However, Saul’s disciples lowered
him in a large basket through an opening
in the wall one night.
26 A er Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he
tried to join the disciples. But everyone
was afraid of him. They wouldn’t believe
that he was a disciple.
27 Then Barnabas took an interest in
Saul and brought him to the apostles.
Barnabas told the apostles how Saul had
seen the Lord on the road and that the
Lord had spoken to him. Barnabas also
told them how boldly Saul had spoken
about the one named Jesus in the city of
Damascus.
28 Then Saul went throughout
Jerusalem with the disciples. He spoke
boldly with the power and authority of
the Lord.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
58
29 He talked and argued with Greek–
speaking Jews, but they tried to murder
him.
30 As soon as the disciples found out
about this, they took Saul to Caesarea
and sent him to Tarsus.
31 Then the church throughout Judea,
Galilee, and Samaria had peace. The
number of people increased as people
lived in the fear of the Lord and the
comfort of the Holy Spirit.
32 When Peter was going around to all
of God’s people, he came to those who
lived in the city of Lydda.
33 In Lydda Peter found a man named
Aeneas who was paralyzed and conﬁned
to a cot for eight years.
34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus
Christ makes you well. Get up, and pick
up your cot." Aeneas immediately got
up.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
59
35 Everyone who lived in the city of
Lydda and the coastal region of Sharon
saw what had happened to Aeneas and
turned to the Lord in faith.
36 A disciple named Tabitha lived in
the city of Joppa. Her Greek name was
Dorcas. She always helped people and
gave things to the poor.
37 She became sick and died. Her body
was prepared for burial and was laid in
an upstairs room.
38 Lydda is near the city of Joppa. When
the disciples heard that Peter was in
Lydda, they sent two men to him. They
begged Peter, "Hurry to Joppa! We need
your help!"
39 So Peter went with them. When he
arrived, he was taken upstairs. All the
widows stood around him. They were
crying and showing Peter the ar cles of
clothing that Dorcas had made while she
was s ll with them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9 – 10
60
40 Peter made everyone leave the room.
He knelt and prayed. Then he turned
toward the body and said, "Tabitha, get
up!" Tabitha opened her eyes, saw Peter,
and sat up.
41 Peter took her hand and helped her
stand up. A er he called the believers,
especially the widows, he presented
Tabitha to them. She was alive.
42 The news about this spread
throughout the city of Joppa, and as a
result, many people believed in the Lord.
43 Peter stayed in Joppa for a number of
days with Simon, a leatherworker.
1 A man named Cornelius lived
in the city of Caesarea. He was
a Roman army oﬃcer in the Italian
Regiment.
2 He and everyone in his home were
devout and respected God. Cornelius
gave many gi s to poor Jewish people
and always prayed to God.
10ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
3 One day, about three in the a
61
ernoon,
he had a vision. He clearly saw an
angel from God come to him and say,
"Cornelius!"
4 He stared at the angel and was
terriﬁed. Cornelius asked the angel,
"What do you want, sir?" The angel
answered him, "God is aware of your
prayers and your gi s to the poor, and
he has remembered you.
5 Send messengers now to the city of
Joppa, and summon a man whose name
is Simon Peter.
6 He is a guest of Simon, a
leatherworker, whose house is by
the sea."
7 A er saying this, the angel le .
Cornelius called two of his household
servants and a devout soldier, one of
those who served him regularly.
8 Cornelius explained everything to
them and sent them to Joppa.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
62
9 Around noon the next day, while
Cornelius’ men were on their way and
coming close to Joppa, Peter went on
the roof to pray.
10 He became hungry and wanted to
eat. While the food was being prepared,
he fell into a trance.
11 He saw the sky open and something
like a large linen sheet being lowered by
its four corners to the ground.
12 In the sheet were all kinds of
four–footed animals, rep les, and birds.
13 A voice told him, "Get up, Peter! Kill
these animals, and eat them."
14 Peter answered, "I can’t do that,
Lord! I’ve never eaten anything that is
impure or unclean."
15 A voice spoke to him a second me,
"Don’t say that the things which God has
made clean are impure."
16 This happened three mes. Then the
sheet was quickly taken into the sky.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
63
17 While Peter was puzzled by the
meaning of the vision, the men sent by
Cornelius found Simon’s house and went
to the gate.
18 They asked if Simon Peter was staying
there.
19 Peter was s ll thinking about the
vision when the Spirit said to him, "Three
men are looking for you.
20 Get up, and go downstairs. Don’t
hesitate to go with these men. I have
sent them."
21 So Peter went to the men. He said,
"I’m the man you’re looking for. Why are
you here?"
22 The men replied, "Cornelius, a
Roman army oﬃcer, sent us. He’s a
man who has God’s approval and who
respects God. Also, the Jewish people
respect him. A holy angel told him to
summon you to his home to hear what
you have to say."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
64
23 Peter asked the men to come into
the house and had them stay overnight.
The next day Peter le with them. Some
disciples from Joppa went along.
24 The following day they arrived in
Caesarea. Cornelius was expec ng them
and had called his rela ves and close
friends together.
25 When Peter was about to enter
Cornelius’ house, Cornelius met him,
bowed down, and worshiped Peter.
26 But Peter made him get up. He told
him, "Stand up! I’m only a man."
27 As Peter talked, he entered Cornelius’
house and found that many people had
gathered.
28 He said to them, "You understand
how wrong it is for a Jewish man to
associate or visit with anyone of another
race. But God has shown me that I
should no longer call anyone impure or
unclean.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
65
29 That is why I didn’t object to coming
here when you sent for me. I want to
know why you sent for me."
30 Cornelius answered, "Four days ago I
was praying at home. It was at this same
me, three o’clock in the a ernoon.
Suddenly, a man dressed in radiant
clothes stood in front of me.
31 He said to me, ‘Cornelius, God has
heard your prayer and has remembered
your gi s to the poor.
32 So send messengers to Joppa, and
summon a man whose name is Simon
Peter. He’s a guest in the home of Simon,
a leatherworker who lives by the sea.’
33 So I sent for you immediately. Thank
you for coming. All of us are here now
in the presence of God to listen to
everything the Lord has ordered you to
say."
34 Then Peter said, "Now I understand
that God doesn’t play favorites.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
66
35 Rather, whoever respects God and
does what is right is acceptable to him in
any na on.
36 God sent his word to the people of
Israel and brought them the Good News
of peace through Jesus Christ. This Jesus
Christ is everyone’s Lord.
37 You know what happened throughout
Judea. Everything began in Galilee a er
John spread the news about bap sm.
38 You know that God anointed Jesus
from Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
with power. Jesus went everywhere
and did good things, such as healing
everyone who was under the devil’s
power. Jesus did these things because
God was with him.
39 We can tes fy to everything Jesus did
in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem.
People hung him on a cross and killed
him,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
67
40 but God brought him back to life on
the third day. God didn’t show him
41 to all the people. He showed Jesus
to witnesses, apostles he had already
chosen. We apostles are those men who
ate and drank with Jesus a er he came
back to life.
42 He ordered us to warn the people,
‘God has appointed Jesus to judge the
living and the dead.’
43 In addi on, all the prophets tes fy
that people who believe in the one
named Jesus receive forgiveness for
their sins through him."
44 While Peter was s ll speaking, the
Holy Spirit came to everyone who heard
his message.
45 All the believers who were
circumcised and who had come with
Peter were amazed that the gi of the
Holy Spirit had been poured on people
who were not Jewish.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10 – 11 68
46 They heard these non–Jewish people
speaking in other languages and praising
God. Then Peter said,
47 "No one can refuse to bap ze these
people with water. They have received
the Holy Spirit in the same way that we
did."
48 So Peter ordered that they should
be bap zed in the name of Jesus Christ.
Then they asked Peter to stay with them
for several days.
1 The apostles and the believers
throughout Judea heard that
people who were not Jewish had
accepted God’s word.
2 However, when Peter went to
Jerusalem, the believers who insisted on
circumcision began to argue with him.
3 They said, "You went to visit men who
were uncircumcised, and you even ate
with them."
11ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
69
4 Then Peter began to explain to them
point by point what had happened. He
said,
5 "I was praying in the city of Joppa
when I fell into a trance. I saw something
like a large linen sheet being lowered by
its four corners from the sky. The sheet
came near me.
6 I looked into the sheet very closely
and saw tame animals, wild animals,
rep les, and birds.
7 I also heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up,
Peter! Kill these animals, and eat them.’
8 "But I answered, ‘I can’t do that,
Lord! I’ve never put anything impure or
unclean into my mouth.’
9 "A voice spoke from heaven a second
me, ‘Don’t say that the things which
God has made clean are impure.’
10 This happened three mes. Then
everything was pulled back into the sky
again.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
70
11 "At that moment three men arrived
at the house where we were staying.
They had been sent from Caesarea to
ﬁnd me.
12 The Spirit told me to go with them
without any hesita on. Six believers
from Joppa went with me, and we visited
Cornelius’ home.
13 "He told us that he had seen an angel
standing in his home. The angel told
him, ‘Send messengers to Joppa, and
summon a man whose name is Simon
Peter.
14 He will give you a message that will
save you and everyone in your home.’
15 "When I began to speak, the Holy
Spirit came to these people. This was the
same thing that happened to us in the
beginning.
16 I remembered that the Lord had said,
‘John bap zed with water, but you will
be bap zed by the Holy Spirit.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
71
17 When they believed, God gave them
the same gi that he gave us when we
believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So who
was I to interfere with God?"
18 When the others heard this, they had
no further objec ons. They praised God
by saying, "Then God has also led people
who are not Jewish to turn to him so
that they can change the way they think
and act and have eternal life."
19 Some of the believers who were
sca ered by the trouble that broke out
following Stephen’s death went as far
as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and the city of
An och. They spoke God’s word only to
Jewish people.
20 But other believers, who were from
Cyprus and Cyrene, arrived in An och.
They started to spread the Good News
about the Lord Jesus to Greeks.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
72
21 The Lord’s power was with his
followers, and a large number of people
believed and turned to the Lord.
22 A er the news about An och
reached the church in Jerusalem,
Barnabas was sent to An och.
23 When he arrived there, he was
pleased to see what God had done
for them out of kindness. So he
encouraged all the people to remain
solidly commi ed to the Lord.
24 Barnabas was a dependable man,
and he was full of the Holy Spirit and
faith. A large crowd believed in the Lord.
25 Then Barnabas le An och to go to
the city of Tarsus to look for Saul.
26 A er ﬁnding Saul, Barnabas brought
him back to An och. Barnabas and Saul
met with the church in An och for a
whole year and taught a large group
of people. The disciples were calledACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11 – 12 73
Chris ans for the ﬁrst me in the city of
An och.
27 At that me some prophets came
from Jerusalem to the city of An och.
28 One of them was named Agabus.
Through the Spirit Agabus predicted that
a severe famine would aﬀect the en re
world. This happened while Claudius
was emperor.
29 All the disciples in An och decided to
contribute whatever they could aﬀord to
help the believers living in Judea.
30 The disciples did this and sent their
contribu on with Barnabas and Saul to
the leaders in Jerusalem.
1 About that me King Herod
devoted his a en on to
mistrea ng certain members of the
church.
2 He had James, the brother of John,
executed.
12ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
74
3 When he saw how this pleased
the Jews, he arrested Peter too. This
happened during the days of Unleavened
Bread.
4 A er capturing Peter, Herod had him
thrown into prison with sixteen soldiers
in squads of four to guard him. Herod
wanted to bring Peter to trial in front of
the people a er Passover.
5 So Peter was kept in prison, but the
church was praying very hard to God for
him.
6 The night before Herod was going to
bring Peter to trial, Peter was sleeping
between two soldiers. His hands were
bound with two chains, and guards were
in front of the door. They were watching
the prison.
7 Suddenly, an angel from the Lord
stood near Peter, and his cell was ﬁlled
with light. The angel nudged Peter’s
side, woke him up, and said, "Hurry! GetACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
75
up!" At that moment the chains fell from
Peter’s hands.
8 The angel told him, "Put your shoes
on, and get ready to go!" Peter did this.
Then the angel told him, "Put your coat
on, and follow me."
9 Peter followed the angel out of the
cell. He didn’t realize that what the angel
was doing was actually happening. He
thought he was seeing a vision.
10 They passed the ﬁrst and second
guardposts and came to the iron gate
that led into the city. This gate opened
by itself for them, so they went outside
and up the street. The angel suddenly
le Peter.
11 When Peter came to his senses, he
said, "Now I’m sure that the Lord sent
his angel to rescue me from Herod and
from everything the Jewish people are
expec ng to happen to me."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
76
12 When Peter realized what had
happened, he went to the home of
Mary, the mother of John Mark. Many
people had gathered at her home and
were praying.
13 Peter knocked on the door of the
entryway, and a servant named Rhoda
came to answer.
14 When she recognized Peter’s voice,
she was so happy that instead of
opening the door, she ran back inside
and reported, "Peter is standing at the
door!"
15 The people told her, "You’re crazy!"
But she insisted that Peter was at the
door. They said, "It has to be his angel."
16 But Peter kept knocking. When they
opened the door, they were shocked to
see him.
17 Peter mo oned with his hand to
quiet them down and told them how
the Lord had taken him out of prison.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
77
He added, "Tell James and the other
believers about this." Then he le and
went somewhere else.
18 In the morning the soldiers were in
an uproar over what had happened to
Peter.
19 Herod searched for Peter but couldn’t
ﬁnd him. So he ques oned the guards
and gave orders to have them executed.
Then Herod le Judea and went to
Caesarea, where he stayed for a while.
20 Herod was very angry with the
people of Tyre and Sidon. They were
going to meet with Herod. They had
agreed on what they wanted to do: They
enlisted the help of Blastus to ask Herod
for terms of peace. This was because
their ci es depended on Herod for their
food supply. (Blastus was in charge of
the king’s living quarters.)
21 The appointed day came. Herod,
wearing his royal clothes, sat on hisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12 – 13 78
throne and began making a speech to
them.
22 The people started shou ng, "The
voice of a god and not of a man!"
23 Immediately, an angel from the Lord
killed Herod for not giving glory to God.
Herod was eaten by maggots, and he
died.
24 But God’s word con nued to spread
and win many followers.
25 A er Barnabas and Saul delivered
the contribu on to the leaders in
Jerusalem, they returned to An och
from Jerusalem. They brought John
Mark with them.
1 Barnabas, Simeon (called the
Black), Lucius (from Cyrene),
Manaen (a close friend of Herod since
childhood), and Saul were prophets and
teachers in the church in An och.
2 While they were worshiping the Lord
and fas ng, the Holy Spirit said, "Set
13ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
79
Barnabas and Saul apart for me. I want
them to do the work for which I called
them."
3 A er fas ng and praying, Simeon,
Lucius, and Manaen placed their hands
on Barnabas and Saul, and released
them from their work in An och.
4 A er Barnabas and Saul were sent by
the Holy Spirit, they went to the city of
Seleucia and from there sailed to the
island of Cyprus.
5 Arriving in the city of Salamis, they
began to spread God’s word in the
synagogues. John Mark had gone along
to help them.
6 They went through the whole island
as far as the city of Paphos. In Paphos
they met a Jewish man named Barjesus.
He was an astrologer who claimed to be
a prophet.
7 He was associated with an intelligent
man, Sergius Paulus, who was theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
80
governor of the island. The governor
sent for Barnabas and Saul because he
wanted to hear the word of God.
8 Elymas, whose name means
astrologer, opposed them and tried to
distort the meaning of the faith so that
the governor wouldn’t believe.
9 But Saul, also known as Paul, was
ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit. He stared at
Elymas
10 and said, "You are full of dirty tricks
and schemes, you son of the devil! You
hate everything that has God’s approval.
Quit trying to distort the truth about the
way the Lord wants people to live.
11 The Lord is against you now. For a
while you will be blind, unable to see the
light of day." Suddenly, Elymas couldn’t
see a thing. He tried to ﬁnd people to
lead him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
81
12 When the governor saw what had
happened, he believed. The Lord’s
teachings amazed him.
13 Paul and his men took a ship from
Paphos and arrived in Perga, a city in
Pamphylia. John Mark deserted them
there and went back to Jerusalem.
14 Paul and Barnabas le Perga and
arrived in An och, a city near Pisidia. On
the day of worship they went into the
synagogue and sat down.
15 A er reading from Moses’ Teachings
and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders
sent a message to Paul and Barnabas.
The message said, "Brothers, if you have
any words of encouragement for the
people, feel free to speak."
16 Then Paul stood up, mo oned with
his hand, and said, "Men of Israel and
converts to Judaism, listen to me.
17 The God of the people of Israel chose
our ancestors and made them a strongACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
82
na on while they lived as foreigners in
Egypt. He used his powerful arm to bring
them out of Egypt,
18 and he put up with them for about
forty years in the desert.
19 Then he destroyed seven na ons in
Canaan and gave their land to his people
as an inheritance.
20 He did all this in about four hundred
and ﬁ y years. "A er that he gave his
people judges un l the me of the
prophet Samuel.
21 "Then the people demanded a king,
so God gave them Saul, son of Kish, from
the tribe of Benjamin. A er forty years
22 God removed Saul and made David
their king. God spoke favorably about
David. He said, ‘I have found that David,
son of Jesse, is a man a er my own
heart. He will do everything I want him
to do.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
83
23 "God had the Savior, Jesus, come to
Israel from David’s descendants, as he
had promised.
24 Before Jesus began his ministry, John
the Bap zer told everyone in Israel
about the bap sm of repentance.
25 When John was ﬁnishing his work, he
said, ‘Who do you think I am? I’m not
the person you’re looking for. He will
come later. I’m not even good enough to
un e his sandals.’
26 "Brothers––descendants of Abraham
and converts to Judaism––the message
that God saves people was sent to us.
27 The people who live in Jerusalem and
their rulers didn’t know who Jesus was.
They didn’t understand the prophets’
messages, which are read every day of
worship. So they condemned Jesus and
fulﬁlled what the prophets had said.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
84
28 Although they couldn’t ﬁnd any good
reason to kill him, they asked Pilate to
have him executed.
29 When they had ﬁnished doing
everything that was wri en about him,
they took him down from the cross and
placed him in a tomb.
30 But God brought him back to life,
31 and for many days he appeared
to those who had come with him to
Jerusalem from Galilee. These people
are now witnesses and are tes fying to
the Jewish people about him.
32 We are telling you the Good News:
What God promised our ancestors has
happened.
33 God has fulﬁlled the promise for us,
their descendants, by bringing Jesus
back to life. This is what Scripture says
in the second psalm: ‘You are my Son.
Today I have become your Father.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
85
34 "God stated that he brought Jesus
back to life and that Jesus’ body never
decayed. He said, ‘I will give you the
enduring love promised to David.’
35 Another psalm says, ‘You will not
allow your holy one to decay.’
36 A er doing God’s will by serving the
people of his me, David died. He was
laid to rest with his ancestors, but his
body decayed.
37 However, the man God brought back
to life had a body that didn’t decay.
38 "So, brothers, I’m telling you that
through Jesus your sins can be forgiven.
Sins kept you from receiving God’s
approval through Moses’ Teachings.
39 However, everyone who believes in
Jesus receives God’s approval.
40 "Be careful, or what the prophets
said may happen to you.
41 ’Look, you mockers! Be amazed and
die! I am going to do something in yourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
86
days that you would not believe even if
it were reported to you!’"
42 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving
the synagogue, the people invited them
to speak on the same subject the next
day of worship.
43 When the mee ng of the synagogue
broke up, many Jews and converts to
Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas.
Paul and Barnabas talked with them
and were persuading them to con nue
trus ng God’s good will.
44 On the next day of worship, almost
the whole city gathered to hear the
Lord’s word.
45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they
became very jealous. They used insul ng
language to contradict whatever Paul
said.
46 Paul and Barnabas told them boldly,
"We had to speak the word of God to
you ﬁrst. Since you reject the wordACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
87
and consider yourselves unworthy of
everlas ng life, we are now going to turn
to people of other na ons.
47 The Lord gave us the following order:
‘I have made you a light for the na ons
so that you would save people all over
the world.’"
48 The people who were not Jews
were pleased with what they heard and
praised the Lord’s word. Everyone who
had been prepared for everlas ng life
believed.
49 The word of the Lord spread
throughout the whole region.
50 But Jews s rred up devout women
of high social standing and the oﬃcials
of the city. These people started to
persecute Paul and Barnabas and threw
them out of their territory.
51 In protest against these people, Paul
and Barnabas shook the dust oﬀ their
feet and went to the city of Iconium.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13 – 14 88
52 Meanwhile, the disciples in An
och
con nued to be full of joy and the Holy
Spirit.
1 The same thing happened in
the city of Iconium. Paul and
Barnabas went into the synagogue and
spoke in such a way that a large crowd of
Jews and Greeks believed.
2 But the Jews who refused to believe
s rred up some people who were not
Jewish and poisoned their minds against
the believers.
3 Paul and Barnabas stayed in the city
of Iconium for a long me. They spoke
boldly about the Lord, who conﬁrmed
their message about his good will by
having them perform miracles and do
amazing things.
4 But the people of Iconium were
divided. Some were for the Jews, while
others were for the apostles.
14ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
5 In the mean
89
me, Paul and Barnabas
found out that the non–Jewish people
and the Jewish people with their rulers
planned to a ack them and stone them
to death.
6 So they escaped to Lystra and Derbe,
ci es of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding
territory.
7 They spread the Good News there.
8 A man who was born lame was in
Lystra. He was always si ng because he
had never been able to walk.
9 He listened to what Paul was saying.
Paul observed him closely and saw that
the man believed he could be made well.
10 So Paul said in a loud voice, "Stand
up." The man jumped up and began to
walk.
11 The crowds who saw what Paul had
done shouted in the Lycaonian language,
"The gods have come to us, and they
look human."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
90
12 They addressed Barnabas as Zeus
and Paul as Hermes because Paul did
most of the talking.
13 Zeus’ temple was at the entrance
to the city. The priest of the god Zeus
brought bulls with ﬂowery wreaths
around their necks to the temple gates.
The priest and the crowd wanted to oﬀer
a sacriﬁce to Paul and Barnabas.
14 When the apostles Barnabas and
Paul heard what was happening, they
were very upset. They rushed into the
crowd
15 and said, "Men, what are you doing?
We’re human beings like you. We’re
spreading the Good News to you to turn
you away from these worthless gods to
the living God. The living God made the
sky, the land, the sea, and everything in
them.
16 In the past God allowed all people to
live as they pleased.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
91
17 Yet, by doing good, he has given
evidence of his existence. He gives you
rain from heaven and crops in their
seasons. He ﬁlls you with food and your
lives with happiness."
18 Although Paul and Barnabas said
these things, they hardly kept the crowd
from sacriﬁcing to them.
19 However, Jews from the ci es of
An och and Iconium arrived in Lystra
and won the people over. They tried to
stone Paul to death and dragged him out
of the city when they thought that he
was dead.
20 But when the disciples gathered
around him, he got up and went back
into the city. The next day Paul and
Barnabas le for the city of Derbe.
21 They spread the Good News in that
city and won many disciples. Then they
went back to the ci es of Lystra, Iconium,
and An och (which is in Pisidia).ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
92
22 They strengthened the disciples in
these ci es and encouraged the disciples
to remain faithful. Paul and Barnabas
told them, "We must suﬀer a lot to enter
the kingdom of God."
23 They had the disciples in each church
choose spiritual leaders, and with prayer
and fas ng they entrusted the leaders to
the Lord in whom they believed.
24 A er they had gone through Pisidia,
they went to Pamphylia.
25 They spoke the message in the city of
Perga and went to the city of A alia.
26 From A alia they took a boat and
headed home to the city of An och
in Syria. (In An och they had been
entrusted to God’s care for the work
they had now ﬁnished.)
27 When they arrived, they called the
members of the church together. They
reported everything God had done
through them, especially that he hadACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14 – 15 93
given people who were not Jewish the
opportunity to believe.
28 They stayed for a long me with
these disciples.
1 Some men came from Judea
and started to teach believers
that people can’t be saved unless they
are circumcised as Moses’ Teachings
require.
2 Paul and Barnabas had a ﬁerce dispute
with these men. So Paul and Barnabas
and some of the others were sent
to Jerusalem to see the apostles and
spiritual leaders about this claim.
3 The church sent Paul and Barnabas to
Jerusalem. As they were going through
Phoenicia and Samaria, they told the
whole story of how non–Jewish people
were turning to God. This story brought
great joy to all the believers.
4 The church in Jerusalem, the apostles,
and the spiritual leaders welcomed Paul
15ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
94
and Barnabas when they arrived. Paul
and Barnabas reported everything that
God had done through them.
5 But some believers from the party
of the Pharisees stood up and said,
"People who are not Jewish must be
circumcised and ordered to follow
Moses’ Teachings."
6 The apostles and spiritual leaders met
to consider this statement.
7 A er a lot of deba ng, Peter stood
up and said to them, "Brothers, you
know what happened some me ago.
God chose me so that people who aren’t
Jewish could hear the Good News and
believe.
8 God, who knows everyone’s thoughts,
showed that he approved of people who
aren’t Jewish by giving them the Holy
Spirit as he gave the Holy Spirit to us.
9 God doesn’t discriminate between
Jewish and non–Jewish people. He hasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
95
cleansed non–Jewish people through
faith as he has cleansed us Jews.
10 So why are you tes ng God? You’re
pu ng a burden on the disciples, a
burden neither our ancestors nor we can
carry.
11 We certainly believe that the Lord
Jesus saves us the same way that he
saves them––through his kindness."
12 The whole crowd was silent. They
listened to Barnabas and Paul tell about
all the miracles and amazing things that
God had done through them among
non–Jewish people.
13 A er they ﬁnished speaking, James
responded, "Brothers, listen to me.
14 Simon has explained how God ﬁrst
showed his concern by taking from
non–Jewish people those who would
honor his name.
15 This agrees with what the prophets
said. Scripture says,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
16 ’A
96
erwards, I will return. I will set up
David’s fallen tent again. I will restore its
ruined places again. I will set it up again
17 so that the survivors and all the
people who aren’t Jewish over whom
my name is spoken, may search for the
Lord, declares the Lord.
18 He is the one who will do these
things that have always been known!’
19 "So I’ve decided that we shouldn’t
trouble non–Jewish people who are
turning to God.
20 Instead, we should write a le er
telling them to keep away from things
polluted by false gods, from sexual
sins, from ea ng the meat of strangled
animals, and from ea ng bloody meat.
21 A er all, Moses’ words have been
spread to every city for genera ons. His
teachings are read in synagogues on
every day of worship."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
97
22 Then the apostles, the spiritual
leaders, and the whole church decided
to choose some of their men to send
with Paul and Barnabas to the city
of An och. They chose Judas (called
Barsabbas) and Silas, who were leaders
among the believers.
23 They wrote this le er for them to
deliver: From the apostles and the
spiritual leaders, your brothers. To their
non–Jewish brothers and sisters in
An och, Syria, and Cilicia. Dear brothers
and sisters,
24 We have heard that some individuals
who came from us have confused you
with statements that disturb you. We
did not authorize these men to speak.
25 So we have come to a unanimous
decision that we should choose men
and send them to you with our dear
Barnabas and Paul.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
98
26 Barnabas and Paul have dedicated
their lives to our Lord, the one named
Jesus Christ.
27 We have sent Judas and Silas to
report to you on our decision.
28 The Holy Spirit and we have agreed
not to place any addi onal burdens on
you. Do only what is necessary
29 by keeping away from food sacriﬁced
to false gods, from ea ng bloody meat,
from ea ng the meat of strangled
animals, and from sexual sins. If you
avoid these things, you will be doing
what’s right. Farewell!
30 So the men were sent on their way
and arrived in the city of An och. They
gathered the congrega on together and
delivered the le er.
31 When the people read the le er, they
were pleased with the encouragement it
brought them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
99
32 Judas and Silas, who were also
prophets, spoke a long me to
encourage and strengthen the believers.
33 A er Judas and Silas had stayed in
An och for some me, the congrega on
sent them back to Jerusalem with
friendly gree ngs to those who had sent
them.
34 (OMITTED TEXT)
35 Paul and Barnabas stayed in An och.
They and many others taught people
about the Lord’s word and spread the
Good News.
36 A er a while Paul said to Barnabas,
"Let’s go back to every city where we
spread the Lord’s word. We’ll visit the
believers to see how they’re doing."
37 Barnabas wanted to take John Mark
along.
38 However, Paul didn’t think it was right
to take a person like him along. JohnACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15 – 16 100
Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia
and had not gone with them to work.
39 Paul and Barnabas disagreed so
sharply that they parted ways. Barnabas
took Mark with him and sailed to the
island of Cyprus.
40 Paul chose Silas and le a er the
believers entrusted him to the Lord’s
care.
41 Paul went through the provinces of
Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the
churches.
1 Paul arrived in the city of Derbe
and then went to Lystra, where a
disciple named Timothy lived. Timothy’s
mother was a Jewish believer, but his
father was Greek.
2 The believers in Lystra and Iconium
spoke well of Timothy.
3 Paul wanted Timothy to go with him.
So he circumcised him because of the
Jews who lived in those places and
16ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
101
because he knew that Timothy’s father
was Greek.
4 As they went through the ci es, they
told people about the decisions that
the apostles and spiritual leaders in
Jerusalem had made for the people.
5 So the churches were strengthened in
the faith and grew in numbers every day.
6 Paul and Silas went through the
regions of Phrygia and Gala a because
the Holy Spirit kept them from speaking
the word in the province of Asia.
7 They went to the province of Mysia
and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit
of Jesus wouldn’t allow this.
8 So they passed by Mysia and went to
the city of Troas.
9 During the night Paul had a vision of
a man from Macedonia. The man urged
Paul, "Come to Macedonia to help us."
10 As soon as Paul had seen the vision,
we immediately looked for a way toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
102
go to Macedonia. We concluded that
God had called us to tell the people of
Macedonia about the Good News.
11 So we took a ship from Troas
and sailed straight to the island of
Samothrace. The next day we sailed to
the city of Neapolis,
12 and from there we went to the city of
Philippi. Philippi is a leading city in that
part of Macedonia, and it is a Roman
colony. We were in this city for a number
of days.
13 On the day of worship we went out of
the city to a place along the river where
we thought Jewish people gathered for
prayer. We sat down and began talking
to the women who had gathered there.
14 A woman named Lydia was present.
She was a convert to Judaism from the
city of Thya ra and sold purple dye for
a living. She was listening because theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
103
Lord made her willing to pay a en on to
what Paul said.
15 When Lydia and her family were
bap zed, she invited us to stay at her
home. She said, "If you’re convinced
that I believe in the Lord, then stay at my
home." She insisted. So we did.
16 One day when we were going to the
place of prayer, a female servant met us.
She was possessed by an evil spirit that
told fortunes. She made a lot of money
for her owners by telling fortunes.
17 She used to follow Paul and shout,
"These men are servants of the Most
High God. They’re telling you how you
can be saved."
18 She kept doing this for many days.
Paul became annoyed, turned to the
evil spirit, and said, "I command you in
the name of Jesus Christ to come out of
her!" As Paul said this, the evil spirit le
her.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
104
19 When her owners realized that their
hope of making money was gone, they
grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged
them to the authori es in the public
square.
20 In front of the Roman oﬃcials, they
said, "These men are s rring up a lot of
trouble in our city. They’re Jews,
21 and they’re advoca ng customs that
we can’t accept or prac ce as Roman
ci zens."
22 The crowd joined in the a ack
against Paul and Silas. Then the oﬃcials
tore the clothes oﬀ Paul and Silas and
ordered the guards to beat them with
s cks.
23 A er they had hit Paul and Silas
many mes, they threw them in jail and
ordered the jailer to keep them under
ght security.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
105
24 So the jailer followed these orders
and put Paul and Silas into solitary
conﬁnement with their feet in leg irons.
25 Around midnight Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns of praise to
God. The other prisoners were listening
to them.
26 Suddenly, a violent earthquake shook
the founda ons of the jail. All the doors
immediately ﬂew open, and all the
prisoners’ chains came loose.
27 The jailer woke up and saw the prison
doors open. Thinking the prisoners had
escaped, he drew his sword and was
about to kill himself.
28 But Paul shouted as loudly as he
could, "Don’t hurt yourself! We’re all
here!"
29 The jailer asked for torches and
rushed into the jail. He was trembling as
he knelt in front of Paul and Silas.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
106
30 Then he took Paul and Silas outside
and asked, "Sirs, what do I have to do to
be saved?"
31 They answered, "Believe in the Lord
Jesus, and you and your family will be
saved."
32 They spoke the Lord’s word to the
jailer and everyone in his home.
33 At that hour of the night, the jailer
washed Paul and Silas’ wounds. The
jailer and his en re family were bap zed
immediately.
34 He took Paul and Silas upstairs into
his home and gave them something to
eat. He and his family were thrilled to be
believers in God.
35 In the morning the Roman oﬃcials
sent guards who told the jailer, "You can
release those men now."
36 The jailer reported this order to
Paul by saying, "The oﬃcials have sentACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
107
word to release you. So you can leave
peacefully now."
37 But Paul told the guards, "Roman
oﬃcials have had us beaten publicly
without a trial and have thrown us in jail,
even though we’re Roman ci zens. Now
are they going to throw us out secretly?
There’s no way they’re going to get away
with that! Have them escort us out!"
38 The guards reported to the oﬃcials
what Paul had said. When the Roman
oﬃcials heard that Paul and Silas were
Roman ci zens, they were afraid.
39 So the oﬃcials went to the jail and
apologized to Paul and Silas. As the
oﬃcials escorted Paul and Silas out of
the jail, they asked them to leave the
city.
40 A er Paul and Silas le the jail, they
went to Lydia’s house. They met with the
believers, encouraged them, and then
le .ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17

108
1 Paul and Silas traveled through
the ci es of Amphipolis and
Apollonia and came to the city of
Thessalonica, where there was a
synagogue.
2 As usual, Paul went into the
synagogue. On three consecu ve days
of worship, he had discussions about
Scripture with the synagogue members.
3 He explained and showed them that
the Messiah had to suﬀer, die, and come
back to life, and that Jesus, the person
he talked about, was this Messiah.
4 Some of the Jews were persuaded
to join Paul and Silas, especially a large
group of Greeks who had converted
to Judaism and the wives of many
prominent men.
5 Then the Jews became jealous. They
took some low–class characters who
hung around the public square, formed
a mob, and started a riot in the city. TheyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
109
a acked Jason’s home and searched it
for Paul and Silas in order to bring them
out to the crowd.
6 When they didn’t ﬁnd Paul and Silas,
they dragged Jason and some other
believers in front of the city oﬃcials.
They shouted, "Those men who have
made trouble all over the world are now
here in Thessalonica,
7 and Jason has welcomed them as
his guests. All of them oppose the
emperor’s decrees by saying that there
is another king, whose name is Jesus."
8 The crowd and the oﬃcials were upset
when they heard this.
9 But a er they had made Jason and
the others post bond, they let them go.
10 Immediately when night came, the
believers sent Paul and Silas to the city
of Berea. When Paul and Silas arrived
in the city of Berea, they entered the
synagogue.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
110
11 The people of Berea were more
open–minded than the people of
Thessalonica. They were very willing to
receive God’s message, and every day
they carefully examined the Scriptures
to see if what Paul said was true.
12 Many of them became believers, and
quite a number of them were prominent
Greek men and women.
13 But when the Jews in Thessalonica
found out that Paul was also spreading
God’s word in Berea, they went there to
upset and confuse the people.
14 The believers immediately sent Paul
to the seacoast, but Silas and Timothy
stayed in Berea.
15 The men who escorted Paul took
him all the way to the city of Athens.
When the men le Athens, they took
instruc ons back to Silas and Timothy to
join Paul as soon as possible.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
16 While Paul was wai
111
ng for Silas and
Timothy in Athens, he saw that the city
had statues of false gods everywhere.
This upset him.
17 He held discussions in the synagogue
with Jews and converts to Judaism.
He also held discussions every day in
the public square with anyone who
happened to be there.
18 Some Epicurean and Stoic
philosophers had discussions with
him. Some asked, "What is this babbling
fool trying to say?" Others said, "He
seems to be speaking about foreign
gods." The philosophers said these
things because Paul was telling the Good
News about Jesus and saying that people
would come back to life.
19 Then they brought Paul to the city
court, the Areopagus, and asked, "Could
you tell us these new ideas that you’re
teaching?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
112
20 Some of the things you say sound
strange to us. So we would like to know
what they mean."
21 Everyone who lived in Athens
looked for opportuni es to tell or hear
something new and unusual.
22 Paul stood in the middle of the court
and said, "Men of Athens, I see that you
are very religious.
23 As I was going through your city
and looking closely at the objects you
worship, I no ced an altar with this
wri en on it: ‘To an unknown god.’ I’m
telling you about the unknown god you
worship.
24 The God who made the universe and
everything in it is the Lord of heaven and
earth. He doesn’t live in shrines made by
humans,
25 and he isn’t served by humans as if
he needed anything. He gives everyone
life, breath, and everything they have.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
113
26 From one man he has made every
na on of humanity to live all over the
earth. He has given them the seasons
of the year and the boundaries within
which to live.
27 He has done this so that they would
look for God, somehow reach for him,
and ﬁnd him. In fact, he is never far from
any one of us.
28 Certainly, we live, move, and exist
because of him. As some of your poets
have said, ‘We are God’s children.’
29 So if we are God’s children, we
shouldn’t think that the divine being is
like an image made from gold, silver, or
stone, an image that is the product of
human imagina on and skill.
30 "God overlooked the mes when
people didn’t know any be er. But now
he commands everyone everywhere to
turn to him and change the way they
think and act.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17 – 18 114
31 He has set a day when he is going to
judge the world with jus ce, and he will
use a man he has appointed to do this.
God has given proof to everyone that he
will do this by bringing that man back to
life."
32 When the people of the court heard
that a person had come back to life,
some began joking about it, while others
said, "We’ll hear you talk about this
some other me."
33 With this response, Paul le the
court.
34 Some men joined him and became
believers. With them were Dionysius,
who was a member of the court, and a
woman named Damaris, and some other
people.
1 A er this, Paul le Athens and
went to the city of Corinth.
2 In Corinth he met a Jewish man
named Aquila and his wife Priscilla.
18ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
115
Aquila had been born in Pontus, and
they had recently come from Italy
because Claudius had ordered all Jews
to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,
3 and because they made tents for a
living as he did, he stayed with them and
they worked together.
4 On every day of worship, Paul would
discuss Scripture in the synagogue. He
tried to win over Jews and Greeks who
had converted to Judaism.
5 But when Silas and Timothy arrived
from Macedonia, Paul devoted all his
me to teaching the word of God.
He assured the Jews that Jesus is the
Messiah.
6 But they opposed him and insulted
him. So Paul shook the dust from
his clothes and told them, "You’re
responsible for your own death. I’m
innocent. From now on I’m going to
people who are not Jewish."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
7 Then he le
116
the synagogue and
went to the home of a man named
Ti us Justus, who was a convert to
Judaism. His house was next door to the
synagogue.
8 The synagogue leader Crispus and his
whole family believed in the Lord. Many
Corinthians who heard Paul believed
and were bap zed.
9 One night the Lord said to Paul in a
vision, "Don’t be afraid to speak out!
Don’t be silent!
10 I’m with you. No one will a ack you
or harm you. I have many people in this
city."
11 Paul lived in Corinth for a year and
a half and taught the word of God to
them.
12 While Gallio was governor of Greece,
the Jews had one thought in mind. They
a acked Paul and brought him to court.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
117
13 They said, "This man is persuading
people to worship God in ways that are
against Moses’ Teachings."
14 Paul was about to answer when
Gallio said to the Jews, "If there were
some kind of misdemeanor or crime
involved, reason would demand that I
put up with you Jews.
15 But since you’re dispu ng words,
names, and your own teachings, you’ll
have to take care of that yourselves.
I don’t want to be a judge who gets
involved in those things."
16 So Gallio had them forced out of his
court.
17 Then all the governor’s oﬃcers took
Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and
beat him in front of the court. But Gallio
couldn’t have cared less.
18 A er staying in Corinth quite a while
longer, Paul le for Ephesus. Priscilla
and Aquila went with him. In the city ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
118
Cenchrea, Aquila had his hair cut, since
he had taken a vow. From Cenchrea they
took a boat headed for Syria
19 and arrived in the city of Ephesus,
where Paul le Priscilla and Aquila. Paul
went into the synagogue and had a
discussion with the Jews.
20 The Jews asked him to stay longer,
but he refused.
21 As he le , he told them, "I’ll come
back to visit you if God wants me to."
Paul took a boat from Ephesus
22 and arrived in the city of Caesarea.
He went to Jerusalem, greeted the
church, and went back to the city of
An och.
23 A er spending some me in An och,
Paul went through the regions of Gala a
and Phrygia, where he strengthened the
faith of all the disciples.
24 A Jew named Apollos, who had been
born in Alexandria, arrived in the city ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
119
Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker
and knew how to use the Scriptures in a
powerful way.
25 He had been instructed in the Lord’s
way and spoke enthusias cally. He
accurately taught about Jesus but knew
only about the bap sm John performed.
26 He began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila
heard him, they took him home with
them and explained God’s way to him
more accurately.
27 When Apollos wanted to travel
to Greece, the believers in Ephesus
encouraged him. They wrote to the
disciples in Greece to tell them to
welcome him. When he arrived in
Greece, God’s kindness enabled him to
help the believers a great deal.
28 In public Apollos helped them by
clearly showing from the Scriptures thatACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
120
Jesus is the Messiah and that the Jews
were wrong.
1 While Apollos was in Corinth,
Paul traveled through the interior
provinces to get to the city of Ephesus.
He met some disciples in Ephesus
2 and asked them, "Did you receive the
Holy Spirit when you became believers?"
They answered him, "No, we’ve never
even heard of the Holy Spirit."
3 Paul asked them, "What kind of
bap sm did you have?" They answered,
"John’s bap sm."
4 Paul said, "John’s bap sm was a
bap sm of repentance. John told people
to believe in Jesus, who was coming
later."
5 A er they heard this, they were
bap zed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6 When Paul placed his hands on them,
the Holy Spirit came to them, and they
19ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
121
began to talk in other languages and to
speak what God had revealed.
7 About twelve men were in the group.
8 For three months Paul would go into
the synagogue and speak boldly. He
had discussions with people to convince
them about the kingdom of God.
9 But when some people became
stubborn, refused to believe, and had
nothing good to say in front of the
crowd about the way of Christ, he le
them. He took his disciples and held
daily discussions in the lecture hall of
Tyrannus.
10 This con nued for two years so that
all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the
province of Asia heard the word of the
Lord.
11 God worked unusual miracles
through Paul.
12 People would take handkerchiefs and
aprons that had touched Paul’s skin toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
122
those who were sick. Their sicknesses
would be cured, and evil spirits would
leave them.
13 Some Jews used to travel from place
to place and force evil spirits out of
people. They tried to use the name of
the Lord Jesus to force evil spirits out
of those who were possessed. These
Jews would say, "I order you to come out
in the name of Jesus, whom Paul talks
about."
14 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief
priest, were doing this.
15 But the evil spirit answered them,
"I know Jesus, and I’m acquainted with
Paul, but who are you?"
16 Then the man possessed by the evil
spirit a acked them. He beat them up
so badly that they ran out of that house
naked and wounded.
17 All the Jews and Greeks living in the
city of Ephesus heard about this. All ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
123
them were ﬁlled with awe for the name
of the Lord Jesus and began to speak
very highly about it.
18 Many believers openly admi ed their
involvement with magical spells and told
all the details.
19 Many of those who were involved
in the occult gathered their books and
burned them in front of everyone. They
added up the cost of these books and
found that they were worth 50,000 silver
coins.
20 In this powerful way the word of the
Lord was spreading and gaining strength.
21 A er all these things had happened,
Paul decided to go to Jerusalem by
traveling through Macedonia and
Greece. He said, "A er I have been
there, I must see Rome."
22 So he sent two of his helpers,
Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
124
while he stayed longer in the province of
Asia.
23 During that me a serious
disturbance concerning the way of Christ
broke out in the city of Ephesus.
24 Demetrius, a silversmith, was in the
business of making silver models of the
temple of Artemis. His business brought
a huge proﬁt for the men who worked
for him.
25 He called a mee ng of his workers
and others who did similar work.
Demetrius said, "Men, you know that
we’re earning a good income from this
business,
26 and you see and hear what this
man Paul has done. He has won over a
large crowd that follows him not only
in Ephesus but also throughout the
province of Asia. He tells people that
gods made by humans are not gods.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
125
27 There’s a danger that people will
discredit our line of work, and there’s a
danger that people will think that the
temple of the great goddess Artemis is
nothing. Then she whom all Asia and the
rest of the world worship will be robbed
of her glory."
28 When Demetrius’ workers and the
others heard this, they became furious
and began shou ng, "Artemis of the
Ephesians is great!"
29 The confusion spread throughout the
city, and the people had one thought in
mind as they rushed into the theater.
They grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, the
Macedonians who traveled with Paul,
and they dragged the two men into the
theater with them.
30 Paul wanted to go into the crowd,
but his disciples wouldn’t let him.
31 Even some oﬃcials who were from
the province of Asia and who were Paul’sACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
126
friends sent messengers to urge him not
to risk going into the theater.
32 Some people shouted one thing
while others shouted something else.
The crowd was confused. Most of the
people didn’t even know why they had
come together.
33 Some people concluded that
Alexander was the cause, so the Jews
pushed him to the front. Alexander
mo oned with his hand to quiet the
people because he wanted to defend
himself in front of them.
34 But when they recognized that
Alexander was a Jew, everyone started
to shout in unison, "Artemis of the
Ephesians is great!" They kept doing this
for about two hours.
35 The city clerk ﬁnally quieted the
crowd. Then he said, "Ci zens of
Ephesus, everyone knows that this city
of the Ephesians is the keeper of theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19 – 20 127
temple of the great Artemis. Everyone
knows that Ephesus is the keeper of the
statue that fell down from Zeus.
36 No one can deny this. So you have to
be quiet and not do anything foolish.
37 The men you brought here don’t rob
temples or insult our goddess.
38 If Demetrius and the men who work
for him have a legal complaint against
anyone, we have special days and
oﬃcials to hold court. That’s where they
should bring charges against each other.
39 If you want anything else, you must
se le the ma er in a legal assembly.
40 At this moment we run the risk of
being accused of rio ng today for no
reason. We won’t be able to explain this
mob."
41 A er saying this, he dismissed the
assembly.
1 When the uproar was over,
Paul sent for the disciples,
20ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
128
encouraged them, said goodbye, and le
for Macedonia.
2 He went through that region and
spoke many words of encouragement to
the people. Then he went to Greece
3 and stayed there for three months.
When Paul was going to board a ship for
Syria, he found out that the Jews were
plo ng to kill him. So he decided to go
back through Macedonia.
4 Sopater (son of Pyrrhus) from
Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus
from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe,
Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus
from the province of Asia accompanied
Paul.
5 All these men went ahead and were
wai ng for us in Troas.
6 A er the Fes val of Unleavened
Bread, we boarded a ship at Philippi.
Five days later we joined them in Troas
and stayed there for seven days.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
129
7 On Sunday we met to break bread.
Paul was discussing Scripture with the
people. Since he intended to leave the
next day, he kept talking un l midnight.
8 (Many lamps were lit in the upstairs
room where we were mee ng.)
9 A young man named Eutychus was
si ng in a window. As Paul was talking
on and on, Eutychus was gradually falling
asleep. Finally, overcome by sleep, he
fell from the third story and was dead
when they picked him up.
10 Paul went to him, took him into
his arms, and said, "Don’t worry! He’s
alive!"
11 Then Eutychus went upstairs again,
broke the bread, and ate. Paul talked
with the people for a long me, un l
sunrise, and then le .
12 The people took the boy home. They
were greatly relieved that he was alive.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
130
13 We went ahead to the ship and sailed
for the city of Assos. At Assos, we were
going to pick up Paul. He had made these
arrangements, since he had planned to
walk overland to Assos.
14 When Paul met us in Assos, we took
him on board and went to the city of
Mitylene.
15 We sailed from there. On the
following day we approached the island
of Chios. The next day we went by the
island of Samos, and on the next day we
arrived at the city of Miletus.
16 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus
to avoid spending me in the province
of Asia. He was in a hurry to get to
Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if
that was possible.
17 From Miletus Paul sent messengers
to the city of Ephesus and called the
spiritual leaders of the church to meet
with him in Miletus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
131
18 When they were with him, he said
to them, "You know how I spent all my
me with you from the ﬁrst day I arrived
in the province of Asia.
19 I humbly served the Lord, o en with
tears in my eyes. I served the Lord during
the diﬃcult mes I went through when
the Jews plo ed against me.
20 I didn’t avoid telling you anything
that would help you, and I didn’t avoid
teaching you publicly and from house to
house.
21 I warned Jews and Greeks to change
the way they think and act and to believe
in our Lord Jesus.
22 "I am determined to go to Jerusalem
now. I don’t know what will happen to
me there.
23 However, the Holy Spirit warns me
in every city that imprisonment and
suﬀering are wai ng for me.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
132
24 But I don’t place any value on my
own life. I want to ﬁnish the race I’m
running. I want to carry out the mission
I received from the Lord Jesus––the
mission of tes fying to the Good News
of God’s kindness.
25 "Now I know that none of you whom
I told about the kingdom of Godwill see
me again.
26 Therefore, I declare to you today that
I am not responsible for the spiritual
death of any of you.
27 I didn’t avoid telling you the whole
plan of God.
28 Pay a en on to yourselves and
to the en re ﬂock in which the Holy
Spirit has placed you as bishops to be
shepherds for God’s church which he
acquired with his own blood.
29 I know that ﬁerce wolves will come
to you a er I leave, and they won’t spare
the ﬂock.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
133
30 Some of your own men will come
forward and say things that distort the
truth. They will do this to lure disciples
into following them.
31 So be alert! Remember that I
instructed each of you for three years,
day and night, at mes with tears in my
eyes.
32 "I am now entrus ng you to God and
to his message that tells how kind he is.
That message can help you grow and can
give you the inheritance that is shared
by all of God’s holy people.
33 "I never wanted anyone’s silver, gold,
or clothes.
34 You know that I worked to support
myself and those who were with me.
35 I have given you an example that by
working hard like this we should help the
weak. We should remember the words
that the Lord Jesus said, ‘Giving gi s is
more sa sfying than receiving them.’"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20 – 21 134
36 When Paul had ﬁnished speaking, he
knelt down and prayed with all of them.
37 Everyone cried a lot as they put their
arms around Paul and kissed him.
38 The thought of not seeing Paul again
hurt them most of all. Then they took
Paul to the ship.
1 When we ﬁnally le them, we
sailed straight to the island of
Cos. The next day we sailed to the island
of Rhodes and from there to the city of
Patara.
2 In Patara, we found a ship that was
going to Phoenicia, so we went aboard
and sailed away.
3 We could see the island of Cyprus
as we passed it on our le and sailed
to Syria. We landed at the city of Tyre,
where the ship was to unload its cargo.
4 In Tyre we searched for the disciples.
A er we found them, we stayed there
21ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
135
for seven days. The Spirit had the
disciples tell Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
5 When our me was up, we started on
our way. All of them with their wives and
children accompanied us out of the city.
We knelt on the beach, prayed,
6 and said goodbye to each other.
Then we went aboard the ship, and the
disciples went back home.
7 Our sea travel ended when we sailed
from Tyre to the city of Ptolemais. We
greeted the believers in Ptolemais and
spent the day with them.
8 The next day we went to Philip’s home
in Caesarea and stayed with him. He was
a missionary and one of the seven men
who helped the apostles.
9 Philip had four unmarried daughters
who had the ability to speak what God
had revealed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
10 A
136
er we had been there for a number
of days, a prophet named Agabus arrived
from Judea.
11 During his visit he took Paul’s belt
and ed his own feet and hands with it.
Then he said, "The Holy Spirit says, ‘This
is how the Jews in Jerusalem will e up
the man who owns this belt. Then they
will hand him over to people who are
not Jewish.’"
12 When we heard this, we and the
believers who lived there begged Paul
not to go to Jerusalem.
13 Then Paul replied, "Why are you
crying like this and breaking my heart?
I’m ready not only to be ed up in
Jerusalem but also to die there for the
sake of the Lord, the one named Jesus."
14 When Paul could not be persuaded,
we dropped the issue and said, "May the
Lord’s will be done."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
15 A
137
er that, we got ready to go to
Jerusalem.
16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea
went with us. They took us to Mnason’s
home, where we would be staying.
Mnason was from the island of Cyprus
and was one of the ﬁrst disciples.
17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the
believers welcomed us warmly.
18 The next day Paul went with us to
visit James. All the spiritual leaders were
present.
19 A er gree ng them, Paul related
everything God had done through his
work with non–Jewish people.
20 When the spiritual leaders heard
about everything, they praised God.
They said to Paul, "You see, brother,
how many thousands of Jews are now
believers, and all of them are deeply
commi ed to Moses’ Teachings.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
138
21 But they have been told that
you teach all the Jews living among
non–Jewish people to abandon Moses.
They claim that you tell them not to
circumcise their children or follow
Jewish customs.
22 What should we do about this? They
will certainly hear that you’re in town.
23 So follow our advice. We have four
men who have made a vow to God.
24 Take these men, go through the
puriﬁca on ceremony with them, and
pay the expenses to shave their heads.
Then everyone will know that what
they’ve been told about you isn’t true.
Instead, they’ll see that you carefully
follow Moses’ Teachings.
25 "To clarify this ma er, we have
wri en non–Jewish believers a le er
with our decision. We told them that
they should not eat food sacriﬁced to
false gods, bloody meat, or the meat ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
139
strangled animals. They also should not
commit sexual sins."
26 The next day, Paul took the men and
went through the puriﬁca on ceremony
with them. Then he went into the temple
courtyard to announce the me when
the puriﬁca on would be over and the
sacriﬁce would be oﬀered for each of
them.
27 When the seven days were almost
over, the Jews from the province of Asia
saw Paul in the temple courtyard. They
s rred up the whole crowd and grabbed
Paul.
28 Then they began shou ng, "Men of
Israel, help! This is the man who teaches
everyone everywhere to turn against the
Jewish people, Moses’ Teachings, and
this temple. He has even brought Greeks
into the temple courtyard and has made
this holy place unclean."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
140
29 They had seen Trophimus from
Ephesus with him in the city earlier and
thought Paul had taken him into the
temple courtyard.
30 The whole city was in chaos, and a
mob formed. The mob grabbed Paul
and dragged him out of the temple
courtyard. The courtyard doors were
immediately shut.
31 As the people were trying to kill
Paul, the oﬃcer in charge of the Roman
soldiers received a report that all
Jerusalem was rio ng.
32 Immediately, he took some soldiers
and oﬃcers and charged the crowd.
When the crowd saw the oﬃcer and the
soldiers, they stopped bea ng Paul.
33 Then the oﬃcer went to Paul,
grabbed him, and ordered him to be ed
up with two chains. The oﬃcer asked
who Paul was and what he had done.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
141
34 Some of the crowd shouted one
thing, while others shouted something
else. The oﬃcer couldn’t get any facts
because of the noise and confusion, so
he ordered Paul to be taken into the
barracks.
35 When Paul came to the stairs of the
barracks, the crowd was so violent that
the soldiers had to carry him.
36 The mob was behind them shou ng,
"Kill him!"
37 As the soldiers were about to take
Paul into the barracks, he asked the
oﬃcer, "May I say something to you?"
The oﬃcer replied to Paul, "Can you
speak Greek?
38 Aren’t you the Egyp an who started
a revolu on not long ago and led four
thousand terrorists into the desert?"
39 Paul answered, "I’m a Jew, a ci zen
from the well–known city of Tarsus inACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21 – 22 142
Cilicia. I’m asking you to let me talk to
the people."
40 The oﬃcer gave Paul permission to
speak. So Paul stood on the stairs of the
barracks and mo oned with his hand for
the people to be quiet. When the mob
was silent, Paul spoke to them in the
Hebrew language.
1 "Brothers and fathers, listen as
I now present my case to you."
2 When the mob heard him speak to
them in Hebrew, they became even
more quiet. Then Paul con nued,
3 "I’m a Jew. I was born and raised in
the city of Tarsus in Cilicia and received
my educa on from Gamaliel here
in Jerusalem. My educa on was in
the strict rules handed down by our
ancestors. I was as devoted to God as all
of you are today.
4 I persecuted people who followed the
way of Christ: I ed up men and women
22ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
143
and put them into prison un l they were
executed.
5 The chief priest and the en re council
of our leaders can prove that I did this.
In fact, they even gave me le ers to
take to the Jewish community in the
city of Damascus. I was going there to
e up believers and bring them back to
Jerusalem to punish them.
6 "But as I was on my way and
approaching the city of Damascus
about noon, a bright light from heaven
suddenly ﬂashed around me.
7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice
asking me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why are you
persecu ng me?’
8 "I answered, ‘Who are you, sir?’
"The person told me, ‘I’m Jesus from
Nazareth, the one you’re persecu ng.’
9 "The men who were with me saw the
light but didn’t understand what the
person who was speaking to me said.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
144
10 "Then I asked, ‘What do you want me
to do, Lord?’ "The Lord told me, ‘Get up!
Go into the city of Damascus, and you’ll
be told everything I’ve arranged for you
to do.’
11 "I was blind because the light
had been so bright. So the men who
were with me led me into the city of
Damascus.
12 "A man named Ananias lived in
Damascus. He was a devout person who
followed Moses’ Teachings. All the Jews
living in Damascus spoke highly of him.
13 He came to me, stood beside me,
and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your
sight!’ At that moment my sight came
back and I could see Ananias.
14 "Ananias said, ‘The God of our
ancestors has chosen you to know his
will, to see the one who has God’s
approval, and to hear him speak to you.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
145
15 You will be his witness and will tell
everyone what you have seen and heard.
16 What are you wai ng for now? Get
up! Be bap zed, and have your sins
washed away as you call on his name.’
17 "A er that, I returned to Jerusalem.
While I was praying in the temple
courtyard, I fell into a trance
18 and saw the Lord. He told me, ‘Hurry!
Get out of Jerusalem immediately.
The people here won’t accept your
tes mony about me.’
19 "I said, ‘Lord, people here know that
I went from synagogue to synagogue to
imprison and whip those who believe in
you.
20 When Stephen, who witnessed about
you, was being killed, I was standing
there. I approved of his death and
guarded the coats of those who were
murdering him.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
146
21 "But the Lord told me, ‘Go! I’ll send
you on a mission. You’ll go far away to
people who aren’t Jewish.’"
22 Up to that point the mob listened.
Then they began to shout, "Kill him! The
world doesn’t need a man like this. He
shouldn’t have been allowed to live this
long!"
23 The mob was yelling, taking oﬀ their
coats, and throwing dirt into the air.
24 So the oﬃcer ordered the soldiers
to take Paul into the barracks and told
them to ques on Paul as they whipped
him. The oﬃcer wanted to ﬁnd out why
the people were yelling at Paul like this.
25 But when the soldiers had Paul
stretch out to e him to the whipping
post with the straps, Paul asked the
sergeant who was standing there, "Is it
legal for you to whip a Roman ci zen
who hasn’t had a trial?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
147
26 When the sergeant heard this, he
reported it to his commanding oﬃcer.
The sergeant asked him, "What are you
doing? This man is a Roman ci zen."
27 The oﬃcer went to Paul and asked
him, "Tell me, are you a Roman ci zen?"
Paul answered, "Yes."
28 The oﬃcer replied, "I paid a lot of
money to become a Roman ci zen."
Paul replied, "But I was born a Roman
ci zen."
29 Immediately, the soldiers who were
going to ques on Paul stepped away
from him. The oﬃcer was afraid when he
found out that he had ed up a Roman
ci zen.
30 The oﬃcer wanted to ﬁnd out exactly
what accusa on the Jews had against
Paul. So the oﬃcer released Paul the
next day and ordered the chief priests
and the en re Jewish council to meet.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
148
Then the oﬃcer brought Paul and had
him stand in front of them.
1 Paul stared at the Jewish
council and said, "Brothers, my
rela onship with God has always given
me a perfectly clear conscience."
2 The chief priest Ananias ordered the
men standing near Paul to strike him on
the mouth.
3 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike
you, you hypocrite! You sit there and
judge me by Moses’ Teachings and yet
you break those teachings by ordering
these men to strike me!"
4 The men standing near Paul said to
him, "You’re insul ng God’s chief priest!"
5 Paul answered, "Brothers, I didn’t
know that he is the chief priest. A er all,
Scripture says, ‘Don’t speak evil about a
ruler of your people.’"
6 When Paul saw that some of
them were Sadducees and others
23ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
149
were Pharisees, he shouted in the
council, "Brothers, I’m a Pharisee and
a descendant of Pharisees. I’m on trial
because I expect that the dead will come
back to life."
7 A er Paul said that, the Pharisees and
Sadducees began to quarrel, and the
men in the mee ng were divided.
8 (The Sadducees say that the dead
won’t come back to life and that angels
and spirits don’t exist. The Pharisees
believe in all these things.)
9 The shou ng became very loud.
Some of the scribes were Pharisees who
argued their posi on forcefully. They
said, "We don’t ﬁnd anything wrong
with this man. Maybe a spirit or an angel
actually spoke to him!"
10 The quarrel was becoming violent,
and the oﬃcer was afraid that they
would tear Paul to pieces. So the oﬃcerACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
150
ordered his soldiers to drag Paul back to
the barracks.
11 The Lord stood near Paul the next
night and said to him, "Don’t lose your
courage! You’ve told the truth about
me in Jerusalem. Now you must tell the
truth about me in Rome."
12 In the morning the Jews formed a
conspiracy. They asked God to curse
them if they ate or drank anything before
they had killed Paul.
13 More than forty men took part in this
plot.
14 They went to the chief priests and
leaders of the people and said, "We’ve
asked God to curse us if we taste any
food before we’ve killed Paul.
15 Here’s our plan: You and the council
must go to the Roman oﬃcer on the
pretext that you need more informa on
from Paul. You have to make it look as
though you want to get more accurateACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
151
informa on about him. We’ll be ready to
kill him before he gets to you."
16 But Paul’s nephew heard about the
ambush. He entered the barracks and
told Paul.
17 Then Paul called one of the sergeants
and told him, "Take this young man to
the oﬃcer. He has something to tell
him."
18 The sergeant took the young man
to the oﬃcer and said, "The prisoner
Paul called me. He asked me to bring
this young man to you because he has
something to tell you."
19 The oﬃcer took the young man by
the arm, went where they could be
alone, and asked him, "What do you
have to tell me?"
20 The young man answered, "The Jews
have planned to ask you to bring Paul to
the Jewish council tomorrow. They’re
going to make it look as though theyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
152
want more accurate informa on about
him.
21 Don’t let them persuade you to
do this. More than forty of them are
planning to ambush him. They have
asked God to curse them if they eat
or drink anything before they have
murdered him. They are ready now and
are expec ng you to promise that you
will bring Paul."
22 The oﬃcer dismissed the young
man and ordered him not to tell this
informa on to anyone else.
23 Then the oﬃcer summoned two of
his sergeants and told them, "I want 200
infantrymen, 70 soldiers on horseback,
and 200 soldiers with spears. Have them
ready to go to Caesarea at nine o’clock
tonight.
24 Provide an animal for Paul to ride,
and take him safely to Governor Felix."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
25 The oﬃcer wrote a le
153
er to the
governor with the following message:
26 Claudius Lysias sends gree ngs to
Your Excellency, Governor Felix:
27 The Jews had seized this man and
were going to murder him. When I found
out that he was a Roman ci zen, I went
with my soldiers to rescue him.
28 I wanted to know what they had
against him. So I took him to their Jewish
council
29 and found their accusa ons had to
do with disputes about Jewish teachings.
He wasn’t accused of anything for which
he deserved to die or to be put into
prison.
30 Since I was informed that there was
a plot against this man, I immediately
sent him to you. I have also ordered his
accusers to state their case against him
in front of you.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23 – 24 154
31 So the infantrymen did as they had
been ordered. They took Paul to the city
of An patris during the night.
32 They returned to their barracks
the next day and let the soldiers on
horseback travel with Paul.
33 When the soldiers arrived in the city
of Caesarea with Paul, they delivered the
le er to the governor and handed Paul
over to him.
34 A er the governor had read the
le er, he asked Paul which province he
was from. When he found out that Paul
was from the province of Cilicia,
35 he said, "I’ll hear your case when
your accusers arrive." Then the governor
gave orders to keep Paul under guard in
Herod’s palace.
1 Five days later the chief priest
Ananias went to the city of
Caesarea with some leaders of the
people and an a orney named Tertullus.
24ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
155
They reported to the governor their
charges against Paul.
2 When Paul had been summoned,
Tertullus began to accuse him. He said
to Felix, "Your Excellency, through your
wise leadership we have las ng peace
and reforms that beneﬁt the people.
3 We appreciate what you’ve done in
every way and in every place, and we
want to thank you very much.
4 I don’t want to keep you too long.
Please listen to us. We will be brief.
5 We have found this man to be a
troublemaker. He starts quarrels among
all Jews throughout the world. He’s a
ringleader of the Nazarene sect.
6 He also entered the temple courtyard
in a way that violates our tradi on. So
we arrested him.
7 (OMITTED TEXT)ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
156
8 When you cross–examine him, you’ll
be able to ﬁnd out from him that our
accusa ons are true."
9 The Jews supported Tertullus’
accusa ons and asserted that everything
Tertullus said was true.
10 The governor mo oned for Paul to
speak. Paul responded, "I know that you
have been a judge over this na on for
many years. So I’m pleased to present
my case to you.
11 You can verify for yourself that I went
to Jerusalem to worship no more than
twelve days ago.
12 No one found me having a discussion
with anyone in the temple courtyard or
s rring up a crowd in the synagogues
throughout the city.
13 These people cannot even prove
their accusa ons to you.
14 But I’ll admit to you that I’m a
follower of the way of Christ, which theyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
157
call a sect. This means that I serve our
ancestors’ God and believe everything
wri en in Moses’ Teachings and the
Prophets.
15 I hope for the same thing my accusers
do, that people with God’s approval and
those without it will come back to life.
16 With this belief I always do my best
to have a clear conscience in the sight of
God and people.
17 A er many years I have come back to
my people and brought gi s for the poor
and oﬀerings for God.
18 My accusers found me in the temple
courtyard doing these things a er I had
gone through the puriﬁca on ceremony.
No crowd or noisy mob was present.
19 But some Jews from the province of
Asia were there. They should be here in
front of you to accuse me if they have
anything against me.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
158
20 Otherwise, these men who are
accusing me should tell what I was
charged with when I stood in front of
their council.
21 They could accuse me of only one
thing. As I stood among them, I shouted,
‘I’m being tried in front of you because I
believe that the dead will come back to
life.’"
22 Felix knew the way of Christ rather
well, so he adjourned the trial. He told
them, "When the oﬃcer Lysias arrives,
I’ll decide your case."
23 Felix ordered the sergeant to guard
Paul but to let him have some freedom
and to let his friends take care of his
needs.
24 Some days later Felix arrived with his
wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent
for Paul and listened to him talk about
faith in Christ Jesus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24 – 25 159
25 As Paul discussed the subjects of
God’s approval, self–control, and the
coming judgment, Felix became afraid
and said, "That’s enough for now. You
can go. When I ﬁnd me, I’ll send for you
again."
26 At the same me, Felix was hoping
that Paul would give him some money.
For that reason, Felix would send
for Paul rather o en to have friendly
conversa ons with him.
27 Two years passed. Then Porcius
Festus took Felix’s place. (Since Felix
wanted to do the Jews a favor, he le
Paul in prison.)
1 Three days a er Festus took
over his du es in the province of
Judea, he went from the city of Caesarea
to Jerusalem.
2 The chief priests and the other
important Jewish leaders informed
25ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
160
Festus about their charges against Paul.
They were urging
3 Festus to do them the favor of having
Paul brought to Jerusalem. The Jews
had a plan to ambush and kill Paul as he
traveled to Jerusalem.
4 Festus replied that he would be
returning to Caesarea soon and would
keep Paul there.
5 He told them, "Have your authori es
come to Caesarea with me and accuse
him there if the man has done something
wrong."
6 Festus stayed in Jerusalem for eight or
ten days at the most and then returned
to Caesarea. The next day Festus took
his place in court and summoned Paul.
7 When Paul entered the room, the
Jews who had come from Jerusalem
surrounded him. They made a lot of
serious accusa ons that they couldn’t
prove.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
161
8 Paul defended himself by saying, "I
haven’t broken any Jewish law or done
anything against the temple or the
emperor."
9 But Festus wanted to do the Jews a
favor. So he asked Paul, "Are you willing
to go to Jerusalem to be tried there on
these charges with me as your judge?"
10 Paul said, "I am standing in the
emperor’s court where I must be tried.
I haven’t done anything wrong to the
Jews, as you know very well.
11 If I am guilty and have done
something wrong for which I deserve
the death penalty, I don’t reject the idea
of dying. But if their accusa ons are
untrue, no one can hand me over to
them as a favor. I appeal my case to the
emperor!"
12 Festus discussed the appeal with his
advisers and then replied to Paul, "YouACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
162
have appealed your case to the emperor,
so you’ll go to the emperor!"
13 Later King Agrippa and Bernice came
to the city of Caesarea to welcome
Festus.
14 Since they were staying there for a
number of days, Festus told the king
about Paul’s case. Festus said, "Felix le
a man here in prison.
15 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief
priests and the Jewish leaders brought
me some informa on about him and
asked me to condemn him.
16 "I replied to them, ‘That’s not the
Roman way of doing things. A person
can’t be sentenced as a favor. Before he
is sentenced, he must face his accusers
and have a chance to defend himself
against their accusa on.’
17 "So the Jewish leaders came to
Caesarea with me. The next day IACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
163
immediately convened court and
summoned the man.
18 When his accusers stood up, they
didn’t accuse him of the crimes I was
expec ng.
19 They were dispu ng with him about
their own religion and about some man
named Jesus who had died. But Paul
claimed that Jesus is alive.
20 Their debate about these things le
me puzzled. So I asked Paul if he would
like to go to Jerusalem to have his case
heard there.
21 But Paul appealed his case. He asked
to be held in prison and to have His
Majesty the Emperor decide his case. So
I ordered him to be held in prison un l I
could send him to the emperor."
22 Agrippa told Festus, "I would like to
hear the man." Festus replied, "You’ll
hear him tomorrow."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
164
23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice
entered the auditorium with a lot of
fanfare. Roman army oﬃcers and the
most important men of the city entered
the auditorium with them. Festus gave
the order, and Paul was brought into the
auditorium.
24 Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and
everyone who is present with us! All the
Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea have
talked to me about this man you see in
front of you. They shout that he must
not be allowed to live any longer.
25 However, I don’t think that he has
done anything to deserve the death
penalty. But since he made an appeal to
His Majesty the Emperor, I have decided
to send him to Rome.
26 But I don’t have anything reliable
to write our emperor about him. So
I have brought him to all of you, and
especially to you, King Agrippa. ThenACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25 – 26 165
I’ll have something to write a er he is
cross–examined.
27 I ﬁnd it ridiculous to send a prisoner
to Rome when I can’t specify any charges
against him."
1 Agrippa said to Paul, "You’re
free to speak for yourself." Paul
acknowledged King Agrippa and then
began his defense.
2 "King Agrippa, I think I’m fortunate
today to stand in front of you and defend
myself against every charge that the
Jews brought against me.
3 I say this since you are especially
familiar with every custom and
controversy in Judaism. So I ask you to
listen pa ently to me.
4 "All the Jews know how I lived the
earliest days of my youth with my own
people and in Jerusalem.
5 They’ve known me for a long me
and can tes fy, if they’re willing, that
26ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
166
I followed the strictest party of our
religion. They know that I lived my life as
a Pharisee.
6 "I’m on trial now because I expect
God to keep the promise that he made
to our ancestors.
7 Our twelve tribes expect this promise
to be kept as they worship with intense
devo on day and night. Your Majesty,
the Jews are making accusa ons against
me because I expect God to keep his
promise.
8 Why do all of you refuse to believe
that God can bring dead people back to
life?
9 "I used to think that I had to do a lot
of things to oppose the one named Jesus
of Nazareth.
10 That is what I did in Jerusalem. By
the authority I received from the chief
priests, I locked many Chris ans inACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
167
prison. I voted to have them killed every
me a vote was taken.
11 I even went to each synagogue,
punished believers, and forced them to
curse the name of Jesus. In my furious
rage against them, I hunted them down
in ci es outside Jerusalem.
12 "I was carrying out these ac vi es
when I went to the city of Damascus. I
had the power and authority of the chief
priests.
13 Your Majesty, at noon, while I was
traveling, I saw a light that was brighter
than the sun. The light came from the
sky and shined around me and those
who were with me.
14 All of us fell to the ground, and I
heard a voice asking me in Hebrew, ‘Saul,
Saul! Why are you persecu ng me? It’s
hard for a mortal like you to resist God.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
168
15 "I asked, ‘Who are you, sir?’ "The
Lord answered, ‘I am Jesus, the one
you’re persecu ng.
16 Stand up! I have appeared to you
for a reason. I’m appoin ng you to be a
servant and witness of what you have
seen and of what I will show you.
17 I will rescue you from the Jewish
people and from the non–Jewish people
to whom I am sending you.
18 You will open their eyes and turn
them from darkness to light and from
Satan’s control to God’s. Then they will
receive forgiveness for their sins and
a share among God’s people who are
made holy by believing in me.’
19 "At that point I did not disobey the
vision I saw from heaven, King Agrippa.
20 Instead, I spread the message
that I ﬁrst told to the Jewish people
in Damascus and Jerusalem and
throughout the whole country of Judea. IACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
169
spread the same message to non–Jewish
people. Both groups were expected to
change the way they thought and acted
and to turn to God. I told them to do
things that prove they had changed their
lives.
21 For this reason the Jews took me
prisoner in the temple courtyard and
tried to murder me.
22 "God has been helping me to this
day so that I can stand and tes fy to
important and unimportant people. I tell
them only what the prophets and Moses
said would happen.
23 They said that the Messiah would
suﬀer and be the ﬁrst to come back to
life and would spread light to Jewish and
non–Jewish people."
24 As Paul was defending himself in
this way, Festus shouted, "Paul, you’re
crazy! Too much educa on is driving you
crazy!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
170
25 Paul replied, "I’m not crazy, Your
Excellency Festus. What I’m saying is
true and sane.
26 I can easily speak to a king who
knows about these things. I’m sure
that none of these things has escaped
his a en on. None of this was done
secretly.
27 King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know you believe them!"
28 Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you think
you can quickly persuade me to become
a Chris an?"
29 Paul replied, "I wish to God that
you and everyone listening to me today
would quickly and completely become
as I am (except for being a prisoner)."
30 The king, the governor, Bernice, and
the people who were si ng with them
got up.
31 As they were leaving, they said
to each other, "This man isn’t doingACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26 – 27 171
anything for which he deserves to die or
be put in prison."
32 Agrippa told Festus, "This man could
have been set free if he hadn’t appealed
his case to the emperor."
1 When it was decided that we
should sail to Italy, Paul and some
other prisoners were turned over to an
army oﬃcer. His name was Julius, and he
belonged to the emperor’s division.
2 We set sail on a ship from the city of
Adramy um. The ship was going to stop
at ports on the coast of the province of
Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from
the city of Thessalonica, went with us.
3 The next day we arrived at the city
of Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly and
allowed him to visit his friends and
receive any care he needed.
4 Leaving Sidon, we sailed on the
northern side of the island of Cyprus
27ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
172
because we were traveling against the
wind.
5 We sailed along the coast of the
provinces of Cilicia and Pamphylia
and arrived at the city of Myra in the
province of Lycia.
6 In Myra the oﬃcer found a ship from
Alexandria that was on its way to Italy
and put us on it.
7 We were sailing slowly for a number
of days. Our diﬃcul es began along the
coast of the city of Cnidus because the
wind would not let us go further. So at
Cape Salmone, we started to sail for the
south side of the island of Crete.
8 We had diﬃculty sailing along the
shore of Crete. We ﬁnally came to a port
called Fair Harbors. The port was near
the city of Lasea.
9 We had lost so much me that the day
of fas ng had already past. Sailing was
now dangerous, so Paul advised them,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
173
10 "Men, we’re going to face a disaster
and heavy losses on this voyage. This
disaster will cause damage to the cargo
and the ship, and it will aﬀect our lives."
11 However, the oﬃcer was persuaded
by what the pilot and the owner of the
ship said and not by what Paul said.
12 Since the harbor was not a good
place to spend the winter, most of the
men decided to sail from there. They
hoped to reach the city of Phoenix
somehow and spend the winter there.
(Phoenix is a harbor that faces the
southwest and northwest winds and is
located on the island of Crete.)
13 When a gentle breeze began to blow
from the south, the men thought their
plan would work. They raised the anchor
and sailed close to the shore of Crete.
14 Soon a powerful wind (called a
northeaster) blew from the island.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
174
15 The wind carried the ship away, and
we couldn’t sail against the wind. We
couldn’t do anything, so we were carried
along by the wind.
16 As we dri ed to the sheltered side
of a small island called Cauda, we barely
got control of the ship’s lifeboat.
17 The men pulled it up on deck. Then
they passed ropes under the ship to
reinforce it. Fearing that they would hit
the large sandbank oﬀ the shores of
Libya, they lowered the sail and were
carried along by the wind.
18 We con nued to be tossed so
violently by the storm that the next
day the men began to throw the cargo
overboard.
19 On the third day they threw the
ship’s equipment overboard.
20 For a number of days we couldn’t see
the sun or the stars. The storm wouldn’t
let up. It was so severe that we ﬁnallyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
175
began to lose any hope of coming out of
it alive.
21 Since hardly anyone wanted to eat,
Paul stood among them and said, "Men,
you should have followed my advice
not to sail from Crete. You would have
avoided this disaster and loss.
22 Now I advise you to have courage. No
one will lose his life. Only the ship will be
destroyed.
23 I know this because an angel from
the God to whom I belong and whom I
serve stood by me last night.
24 The angel told me, ‘Don’t be afraid,
Paul! You must present your case to
the emperor. God has granted safety to
everyone who is sailing with you.’
25 So have courage, men! I trust God
that everything will turn out as he told
me.
26 However, we will run aground on
some island."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
176
27 On the fourteenth night we were s
ll
dri ing through the Mediterranean Sea.
About midnight the sailors suspected
that we were approaching land.
28 So they threw a line with a weight on
it into the water. It sank 120 feet. They
waited a li le while and did the same
thing again. This me the line sank 90
feet.
29 Fearing we might hit rocks, they
dropped four anchors from the back
of the ship and prayed for morning to
come.
30 The sailors tried to escape from the
ship. They let the lifeboat down into the
sea and pretended they were going to
lay out the anchors from the front of the
ship.
31 Paul told the oﬃcer and the soldiers,
"If these sailors don’t stay on the ship,
you have no hope of staying alive."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
177
32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes that
held the lifeboat and let it dri away.
33 Just before daybreak Paul was
encouraging everyone to have
something to eat. "This is the fourteenth
day you have waited and have had
nothing to eat.
34 So I’m encouraging you to eat
something. Ea ng will help you survive,
since not a hair from anyone’s head will
be lost."
35 A er Paul said this, he took some
bread, thanked God in front of everyone,
broke it, and began to eat.
36 Everyone was encouraged and had
something to eat.
37 (There were 276 of us on the ship.)
38 A er the people had eaten all they
wanted, they lightened the ship by
dumping the wheat into the sea.
39 In the morning they couldn’t
recognize the land, but they could see aACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
178
bay with a beach. So they decided to try
to run the ship ashore.
40 They cut the anchors free and le
them in the sea. At the same me they
un ed the ropes that held the steering
oars. Then they raised the top sail to
catch the wind and steered the ship to
the shore.
41 They struck a sandbar in the water
and ran the ship aground. The front of
the ship stuck and couldn’t be moved,
while the back of the ship was broken to
pieces by the force of the waves.
42 The soldiers had a plan to kill the
prisoners to keep them from swimming
away and escaping.
43 However, the oﬃcer wanted to save
Paul, so he stopped the soldiers from
carrying out their plan. He ordered those
who could swim to jump overboard ﬁrst
and swim ashore.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27 – 28 179
44 Then he ordered the rest to follow
on planks or some other pieces of wood
from the ship. In this way everyone got
to shore safely.
1 When we were safely on shore,
we found out that the island was
called Malta.
2 The people who lived on the island
were unusually kind to us. They made
a ﬁre and welcomed all of us around it
because of the rain and the cold.
3 Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood
and put it on the ﬁre. The heat forced a
poisonous snake out of the brushwood.
The snake bit Paul’s hand and wouldn’t
let go.
4 When the people who lived on the
island saw the snake hanging from his
hand, they said to each other, "This
man must be a murderer! He may have
escaped from the sea, but jus ce won’t
let him live."
28ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
180
5 Paul shook the snake into the ﬁre and
wasn’t harmed.
6 The people were wai ng for him to
swell up or suddenly drop dead. But
a er they had waited a long me and
saw nothing unusual happen to him,
they changed their minds and said he
was a god.
7 A man named Publius, who was the
governor of the island, had property
around the area. He welcomed us and
treated us kindly, and for three days we
were his guests.
8 His father happened to be sick in
bed. He was suﬀering from fever and
dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed,
placed his hands on him, and made him
well.
9 A er that had happened, other sick
people on the island went to Paul and
were made well.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
181
10 They showed respect for us in many
ways, and when we were going to set
sail, they put whatever we needed on
board.
11 A er three months we sailed on an
Alexandrian ship that had spent the
winter at the island. The ship had the
gods Castor and Pollux carved on its
front.
12 We stopped at the city of Syracuse
and stayed there for three days.
13 We sailed from Syracuse and arrived
at the city of Rhegium. The next day a
south wind began to blow, and two days
later we arrived at the city of Puteoli.
14 In Puteoli we discovered some
believers who begged us to spend a
week with them.
15 Believers in Rome heard that we were
coming, so they came as far as the ci es
of Appius’ Market and Three Taverns
to meet us. When Paul saw them, heACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
182
thanked God and felt encouraged. So we
ﬁnally arrived in the city of Rome.
16 A er our arrival, Paul was allowed to
live by himself, but he had a soldier who
guarded him.
17 A er three days Paul invited the
most inﬂuen al Jews in Rome to meet
with him. When they assembled, he
said to them, "Brothers, I haven’t done
anything against the Jewish people or
violated the customs handed down by
our ancestors. Yet, I’m a prisoner from
Jerusalem, and I’ve been handed over to
the Roman authori es.
18 The Roman authori es cross–
examined me and wanted to let me go
because I was accused of nothing for
which I deserved to die.
19 But when the Jews objected, I was
forced to appeal my case to the emperor.
That doesn’t mean I have any charges to
bring against my own people.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
183
20 That’s why I asked to see you and
speak with you. I’m wearing these chains
because of what Israel hopes for."
21 The Jewish leaders told Paul, "We
haven’t received any le ers from Judea
about you, and no Jewish person who
has come to Rome has reported or
men oned anything bad about you.
22 However, we would like to hear what
you think. We know that everywhere
people are talking against this sect."
23 On a designated day a larger number
of inﬂuen al Jews than expected went
to the place where Paul was staying.
From morning un l evening, Paul was
explaining the kingdom of God to them.
He was trying to convince them about
Jesus from Moses’ Teachings and the
Prophets.
24 Some of them were convinced by
what he said, but others con nued to
disbelieve.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
184
25 The Jews, unable to agree among
themselves, le a er Paul had quoted
this par cular passage to them: "How
well the Holy Spirit spoke to your
ancestors through the prophet Isaiah!
26 The Spirit said: ‘Go to these people
and say, "You will hear clearly but never
understand. You will see clearly but
never comprehend.
27 These people have become close–
minded and hard of hearing. They have
shut their eyes so that their eyes never
see. Their ears never hear. Their minds
never understand. And they never turn
to me for healing."’
28 "You need to know that God has sent
his salva on to people who are not Jews.
They will listen."

1 From Paul, a servant of Jesus
Christ, called to be an apostle and
appointed to spread the Good News of
God.
2 (God had already promised this Good
News through his prophets in the Holy
Scriptures.
3 This Good News is about his Son, our
Lord Jesus Christ. In his human nature
he was a descendant of David.
4 In his spiritual, holy nature he was
declared the Son of God. This was shown
in a powerful way when he came back to
life.
5 Through him we have received
God’s kindness and the privilege of
being apostles who bring people from
every na on to the obedience that isROMANS 1
2
associated with faith. This is for the
honor of his name.
6 You are among those who have been
called to belong to Jesus Christ.)
7 To everyone in Rome whom God loves
and has called to be his holy people.
Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
8 First, I thank my God through Jesus
Christ for every one of you because
the news of your faith is spreading
throughout the whole world.
9 I serve God by spreading the Good
News about his Son. God is my witness
that I always men on you
10 every me I pray. I ask that somehow
God will now at last make it possible for
me to visit you.
11 I long to see you to share a spiritual
blessing with you so that you will be
strengthened.ROMANS 1
3
12 What I mean is that we may be
encouraged by each other’s faith.
13 I want you to know, brothers and
sisters, that I o en planned to visit you.
However, un l now I have been kept
from doing so. What I want is to enjoy
some of the results of working among
you as I have also enjoyed the results of
working among the rest of the na ons.
14 I have an obliga on to those who are
civilized and those who aren’t, to those
who are wise and those who aren’t.
15 That’s why I’m eager to tell you who
live in Rome the Good News also.
16 I’m not ashamed of the Good News.
It is God’s power to save everyone who
believes, Jews ﬁrst and Greeks as well.
17 God’s approval is revealed in this
Good News. This approval begins and
ends with faith as Scripture says, "The
person who has God’s approval will live
by faith."ROMANS 1

18 God’s anger is revealed from heaven
against every ungodly and immoral thing
people do as they try to suppress the
truth by their immoral living.
19 What can be known about God is
clear to them because he has made it
clear to them.
20 From the crea on of the world, God’s
invisible quali es, his eternal power
and divine nature, have been clearly
observed in what he made. As a result,
people have no excuse.
21 They knew God but did not praise
and thank him for being God. Instead,
their thoughts were pointless, and their
misguided minds were plunged into
darkness.
22 While claiming to be wise, they
became fools.
23 They exchanged the glory of the
immortal God for statues that lookedROMANS 1
5
like mortal humans, birds, animals, and
snakes.
24 For this reason God allowed their
lusts to control them. As a result,
they dishonor their bodies by sexual
perversion with each other.
25 These people have exchanged God’s
truth for a lie. So they have become
ungodly and serve what is created rather
than the Creator, who is blessed forever.
Amen!
26 For this reason God allowed their
shameful passions to control them. Their
women have exchanged natural sexual
rela ons for unnatural ones.
27 Likewise, their men have given up
natural sexual rela ons with women
and burn with lust for each other. Men
commit indecent acts with men, so
they experience among themselves
the punishment they deserve for their
perversion.ROMANS 1
6
28 And because they thought it was
worthless to acknowledge God, God
allowed their own immoral minds to
control them. So they do these indecent
things.
29 Their lives are ﬁlled with all kinds
of sexual sins, wickedness, and greed.
They are mean. They are ﬁlled with
envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and
viciousness. They are gossips,
30 slanderers, haters of God, haughty,
arrogant, and boas ul. They think up
new ways to be cruel. They don’t obey
their parents,
31 don’t have any sense, don’t keep
promises, and don’t show love to their
own families or mercy to others.
32 Although they know God’s judgment
that those who do such things deserve
to die, they not only do these things but
also approve of others who do them.ROMANS 2
1 No ma
7
er who you are, if you judge
anyone, you have no excuse. When
you judge another person, you condemn
yourself, since you, the judge, do the
same things.
2 We know that God’s judgment is right
when he condemns people for doing
these things.
3 When you judge people for doing
these things but then do them yourself,
do you think you will escape God’s
judgment?
4 Do you have contempt for God, who
is very kind to you, puts up with you,
and deals pa ently with you? Don’t you
realize that it is God’s kindness that is
trying to lead you to him and change the
way you think and act?
5 Since you are stubborn and don’t
want to change the way you think and
act, you are adding to the anger that
God will have against you on that day
2ROMANS 2
8
when God vents his anger. At that me
God will reveal that his decisions are fair.
6 He will pay all people back for what
they have done.
7 He will give everlas ng life to those
who search for glory, honor, and
immortality by persis ng in doing what
is good. But he will bring
8 anger and fury on those who, in selﬁsh
pride, refuse to believe the truth and
who follow what is wrong.
9 There will be suﬀering and distress for
every person who does evil, for Jews ﬁrst
and Greeks as well.
10 But there will be glory, honor, and
peace for every person who does what
is good, for Jews ﬁrst and Greeks as well.
11 God does not play favorites.
12 Here’s the reason: Whoever sins
without having laws from God will s ll
be condemned to destruc on. AndROMANS 2
9
whoever has laws from God and sins will
s ll be judged by them.
13 People who merely listen to laws
from God don’t have God’s approval.
Rather, people who do what those laws
demand will have God’s approval.
14 For example, whenever non–Jews
who don’t have laws from God do by
nature the things that Moses’ Teachings
contain, they are a law to themselves
even though they don’t have any laws
from God.
15 They show that some requirements
found in Moses’ Teachings are wri en
in their hearts. Their consciences speak
to them. Their thoughts accuse them
on one occasion and defend them on
another.
16 This happens as they face the day
when God, through Christ Jesus, will
judge people’s secret thoughts. He willROMANS 2
10
use the Good News that I am spreading
to make that judgment.
17 You call yourself a Jew, rely on the
laws in Moses’ Teachings, brag about
your God,
18 know what he wants, and dis nguish
right from wrong because you have been
taught Moses’ Teachings.
19 You are conﬁdent that you are a
guide for the blind, a light to those in the
dark,
20 an instructor of ignorant people, and
a teacher of children because you have
the full content of knowledge and truth
in Moses’ Teachings.
21 As you teach others, are you failing
to teach yourself? As you preach against
stealing, are you stealing?
22 As you tell others not to commit
adultery, are you commi ng adultery?
As you treat idols with disgust, are you
robbing temples?ROMANS 2
11
23 As you brag about the laws in Moses’
Teachings, are you dishonoring God by
ignoring Moses’ Teachings?
24 As Scripture says, "God’s name is
cursed among the na ons because of
you."
25 For example, circumcision is valuable
if you follow Moses’ laws. If you don’t
follow those laws, your circumcision
amounts to uncircumcision.
26 So if a man does what Moses’
Teachings demand, won’t he be
considered circumcised even if he is
uncircumcised?
27 The uncircumcised man who carries
out what Moses’ Teachings say will
condemn you for not following them. He
will condemn you in spite of the fact that
you are circumcised and have Moses’
Teachings in wri ng.ROMANS 2 – 3
12
28 A person is not a Jew because of his
appearance, nor is circumcision a ma er
of how the body looks.
29 Rather, a person is a Jew inwardly, and
circumcision is something that happens
in a person’s heart. Circumcision is
spiritual, not just a wri en rule. That
person’s praise will come from God, not
from people.
1 Is there any advantage, then, in
being a Jew? Or is there any value in
being circumcised?
2 There are all kinds of advantages. First
of all, God entrusted them with his word.
3 What if some of them were unfaithful?
Can their unfaithfulness cancel God’s
faithfulness?
4 That would be unthinkable! God
is honest, and everyone else is a liar,
as Scripture says, "So you hand down
jus ce when you speak, and you win
your case in court."
3ROMANS 3
13
5 But if what we do wrong shows that
God is fair, what should we say? Is God
unfair when he vents his anger on us?
(I’m arguing the way humans would.)
6 That’s unthinkable! Otherwise, how
would God be able to judge the world?
7 If my lie increases the glory that God
receives by showing that God is truthful,
why am I s ll judged as a sinner?
8 Or can we say, "Let’s do evil so that
good will come from it"? Some slander
us and claim that this is what we say.
They are condemned, and that’s what
they deserve.
9 What, then, is the situa on? Do we
have any advantage? Not at all. We have
already accused everyone (both Jews
and Greeks) of being under the power of
sin,
10 as Scripture says, "Not one person
has God’s approval.ROMANS 3
14
11 No one understands. No one
searches for God.
12 Everyone has turned away. Together
they have become ro en to the core. No
one does anything good, not even one
person.
13 Their throats are open graves. Their
tongues prac ce decep on. Their lips
hide the venom of poisonous snakes.
14 Their mouths are full of curses and
bi er resentment.
15 They run quickly to murder people.
16 There is ruin and suﬀering wherever
they go.
17 They have not learned to live in
peace.
18 They are not terriﬁed of God."
19 We know that whatever is in Moses’
Teachings applies to everyone under
their inﬂuence, and no one can say a
thing. The whole world is brought under
the judgment of God.ROMANS 3
15
20 Not one person can have God’s
approval by following Moses’ Teachings.
Moses’ Teachings show what sin is.
21 Now, the way to receive God’s
approval has been made plain in a way
other than Moses’ Teachings. Moses’
Teachings and the Prophets tell us this.
22 Everyone who believes has God’s
approval through faith in Jesus Christ.
There is no diﬀerence between people.
23 Because all people have sinned, they
have fallen short of God’s glory.
24 They receive God’s approval freely by
an act of his kindness through the price
Christ Jesus paid to set us free from sin.
25 God showed that Christ is the throne
of mercy where God’s approval is given
through faith in Christ’s blood. In his
pa ence God waited to deal with sins
commi ed in the past.
26 He waited so that he could display his
approval at the present me. This showsROMANS 3
16
that he is a God of jus ce, a God who
approves of people who believe in Jesus.
27 So, do we have anything to brag
about? Bragging has been eliminated.
On what basis was it eliminated? On the
basis of our own eﬀorts? No, indeed!
Rather, it is eliminated on the basis of
faith.
28 We conclude that a person has God’s
approval by faith, not by his own eﬀorts.
29 Is God only the God of the Jews? Isn’t
he also the God of people who are not
Jewish? Certainly, he is,
30 since it is the same God who
approves circumcised people by faith
and uncircumcised people through this
same faith.
31 Are we abolishing Moses’ Teachings
by this faith? That’s unthinkable! Rather,
we are suppor ng Moses’ Teachings.ROMANS 4
4
17
1 What can we say that we have
discovered about our ancestor
Abraham?
2 If Abraham had God’s approval
because of something he did, he would
have had a reason to brag. But he could
not brag to God about it.
3 What does Scripture say? "Abraham
believed God, and that faith was
regarded by God to be his approval of
Abraham."
4 When people work, their pay is not
regarded as a gi but something they
have earned.
5 However, when people don’t work
but believe God, the one who approves
ungodly people, their faith is regarded
as God’s approval.
6 David says the same thing about
those who are blessed: God approves of
people without their earning it. David
said,ROMANS 4
18
7 "Blessed are those whose
disobedience is forgiven and whose sins
are pardoned.
8 Blessed is the person whom the Lord
no longer considers sinful."
9 Are only the circumcised people
blessed, or are uncircumcised people
blessed as well? We say, "Abraham’s
faith was regarded as God’s approval of
him."
10 How was his faith regarded as God’s
approval? Was he circumcised or was he
uncircumcised at that me? He had not
been circumcised.
11 Abraham’s faith was regarded
as God’s approval while he was s ll
uncircumcised. The mark of circumcision
is the seal of that approval. Therefore,
he is the father of every believer who is
not circumcised, and their faith, too, is
regarded as God’s approval of them.ROMANS 4
19
12 He is also the father of those who
not only are circumcised but also are
following in the footsteps of his faith.
Our father Abraham had that faith
before he was circumcised.
13 So it was not by obeying Moses’
Teachings that Abraham or his
descendants received the promise that
he would inherit the world. Rather, it
was through God’s approval of his faith.
14 If those who obey Moses’ Teachings
are the heirs, then faith is useless and
the promise is worthless.
15 The laws in Moses’ Teachings bring
about anger. But where laws don’t exist,
they can’t be broken.
16 Therefore, the promise is based
on faith so that it can be a gi .
Consequently, the promise is guaranteed
for every descendant, not only for those
who are descendants by obeying Moses’
Teachings but also for those who areROMANS 4
20
descendants by believing as Abraham
did. He is the father of all of us,
17 as Scripture says: "I have made you
a father of many na ons." Abraham
believed when he stood in the presence
of the God who gives life to dead people
and calls into existence things that don’t
even exist.
18 When there was nothing le to hope
for, Abraham s ll hoped and believed.
As a result, he became a father of many
na ons, as he had been told: "That is
how many descendants you will have."
19 Abraham didn’t weaken. Through
faith he regarded the facts: His body was
already as good as dead now that he was
about a hundred years old, and Sarah
was unable to have children.
20 He didn’t doubt God’s promise out of
a lack of faith. Instead, giving honor to
God for the promise, he became strong
because of faithROMANS 4 – 5
21
21 and was absolutely conﬁdent that
God would do what he promised.
22 That is why his faith was regarded as
God’s approval of him.
23 But the words "his faith was regarded
as God’s approval of him" were wri en
not only for him
24 but also for us. Our faith will be
regarded as God’s approval of us who
believe in the one who brought Jesus,
our Lord, back to life.
25 Jesus, our Lord, was handed over to
death because of our failures and was
brought back to life so that we could
receive God’s approval.
1 Now that we have God’s approval
by faith, we have peace with God
because of what our Lord Jesus Christ
has done.
2 Through Christ we can approach
God and stand in his favor. So we brag
5ROMANS 5
22
because of our conﬁdence that we will
receive glory from God.
3 But that’s not all. We also brag when
we are suﬀering. We know that suﬀering
creates endurance,
4 endurance creates character, and
character creates conﬁdence.
5 We’re not ashamed to have this
conﬁdence, because God’s love has been
poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
who has been given to us.
6 Look at it this way: At the right me,
while we were s ll helpless, Christ died
for ungodly people.
7 Finding someone who would die for
a godly person is rare. Maybe someone
would have the courage to die for a good
person.
8 Christ died for us while we were s ll
sinners. This demonstrates God’s love
for us.ROMANS 5
23
9 Since Christ’s blood has now given
us God’s approval, we are even more
certain that Christ will save us from
God’s anger.
10 If the death of his Son restored our
rela onship with God while we were
s ll his enemies, we are even more
certain that, because of this restored
rela onship, the life of his Son will save
us.
11 In addi on, our Lord Jesus Christ lets
us con nue to brag about God. A er all,
it is through Christ that we now have this
restored rela onship with God.
12 Sin came into the world through one
person, and death came through sin.
So death spread to everyone, because
everyone sinned.
13 Sin was in the world before there
were any laws. But no record of sin can
be kept when there are no laws.ROMANS 5
14 Yet, death ruled from the
24
me of
Adam to the me of Moses, even over
those who did not sin in the same way
Adam did when he disobeyed. Adam is
an image of the one who would come.
15 There is no comparison between
God’s gi and Adam’s failure. If humanity
died as the result of one person’s failure,
it is certainly true that God’s kindness
and the gi given through the kindness
of one person, Jesus Christ, have been
showered on humanity.
16 There is also no comparison between
God’s gi and the one who sinned. The
verdict which followed one person’s
failure condemned everyone. But, even
a er many failures, the gi brought
God’s approval.
17 It is certain that death ruled because
of one person’s failure. It’s even more
certain that those who receive God’s
overﬂowing kindness and the gi of hisROMANS 5 – 6
25
approval will rule in life because of one
person, Jesus Christ.
18 Therefore, everyone was condemned
through one failure, and everyone
received God’s life–giving approval
through one verdict.
19 Clearly, through one person’s
disobedience humanity became sinful,
and through one person’s obedience
humanity will receive God’s approval.
20 Laws were added to increase the
failure. But where sin increased, God’s
kindness increased even more.
21 As sin ruled by bringing death, God’s
kindness would rule by bringing us his
approval. This results in our living forever
because of Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 What should we say then? Should
we con nue to sin so that God’s
kindness will increase?
6ROMANS 6
26
2 That’s unthinkable! As far as sin is
concerned, we have died. So how can
we s ll live under sin’s inﬂuence?
3 Don’t you know that all of us who
were bap zed into Christ Jesus were
bap zed into his death?
4 When we were bap zed into his
death, we were placed into the tomb
with him. As Christ was brought back
from death to life by the glorious power
of the Father, so we, too, should live a
new kind of life.
5 If we’ve become united with him in a
death like his, certainly we will also be
united with him when we come back to
life as he did.
6 We know that the person we used to
be was cruciﬁed with him to put an end
to sin in our bodies. Because of this we
are no longer slaves to sin.
7 The person who has died has been
freed from sin.ROMANS 6
27
8 If we have died with Christ, we believe
that we will also live with him.
9 We know that Christ, who was brought
back to life, will never die again. Death
no longer has any power over him.
10 When he died, he died once and for
all to sin’s power. But now he lives, and
he lives for God.
11 So consider yourselves dead to sin’s
power but living for God in the power
Christ Jesus gives you.
12 Therefore, never let sin rule your
physical body so that you obey its
desires.
13 Never oﬀer any part of your body
to sin’s power. No part of your body
should ever be used to do any ungodly
thing. Instead, oﬀer yourselves to God
as people who have come back from
death and are now alive. Oﬀer all the
parts of your body to God. Use them to
do everything that God approves of.ROMANS 6
28
14 Certainly, sin shouldn’t have power
over you because you’re not controlled
by laws, but by God’s favor.
15 Then what is the implica on? Should
we sin because we are not controlled
by laws but by God’s favor? That’s
unthinkable!
16 Don’t you know that if you oﬀer to
be someone’s slave, you must obey that
master? Either your master is sin, or your
master is obedience. Le ng sin be your
master leads to death. Le ng obedience
be your master leads to God’s approval.
17 You were slaves to sin. But I thank God
that you have become wholeheartedly
obedient to the teachings which you
were given.
18 Freed from sin, you were made slaves
who do what God approves of.
19 I’m speaking in a human way because
of the weakness of your corrupt nature.
Clearly, you once oﬀered all the parts ofROMANS 6 – 7
29
your body as slaves to sexual perversion
and disobedience. This led you to live
disobedient lives. Now, in the same way,
oﬀer all the parts of your body as slaves
that do what God approves of. This leads
you to live holy lives.
20 When you were slaves to sin, you
were free from doing what God approves
of.
21 What did you gain by doing those
things? You’re ashamed of what you
used to do because it ended in death.
22 Now you have been freed from sin
and have become God’s slaves. This
results in a holy life and, ﬁnally, in
everlas ng life.
23 The payment for sin is death, but the
gi that God freely gives is everlas ng
life found in Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 Don’t you realize, brothers and
sisters, that laws have power over
people only as long as they are alive?
7ROMANS 7
30
(I’m speaking to people who are familiar
with Moses’ Teachings.)
2 For example, a married woman is
bound by law to her husband as long as
he is alive. But if her husband dies, that
marriage law is no longer in eﬀect for
her.
3 So if she marries another man while
her husband is s ll alive, she will be
called an adulterer. But if her husband
dies, she is free from this law, so she is
not commi ng adultery if she marries
another man.
4 In the same way, brothers and sisters,
you have died to the laws in Moses’
Teachings through Christ’s body. You
belong to someone else, the one who
was brought back to life. As a result, we
can do what God wants.
5 While we were living under the
inﬂuence of our corrupt nature, sinful
passions were at work throughout ourROMANS 7
31
bodies. S rred up by Moses’ laws, our
sinful passions did things that result in
death.
6 But now we have died to those laws
that bound us. God has broken their
eﬀect on us so that we are serving in
a new spiritual way, not in an old way
dictated by wri en words.
7 What should we say, then? Are Moses’
laws sinful? That’s unthinkable! In fact,
I wouldn’t have recognized sin if those
laws hadn’t shown it to me. For example,
I wouldn’t have known that some desires
are sinful if Moses’ Teachings hadn’t
said, "Never have wrong desires."
8 But sin took the opportunity provided
by this commandment and made me
have all kinds of wrong desires. Clearly,
without laws sin is dead.
9 At one me I was alive without any
laws. But when this commandment
came, sin became aliveROMANS 7
32
10 and I died. I found that the
commandment which was intended to
bring me life actually brought me death.
11 Sin, taking the opportunity provided
by this commandment, deceived me and
then killed me.
12 So Moses’ Teachings are holy, and
the commandment is holy, right, and
good.
13 Now, did something good cause
my death? That’s unthinkable! Rather,
my death was caused by sin so that
sin would be recognized for what it is.
Through a commandment sin became
more sinful than ever.
14 I know that God’s standards are
spiritual, but I have a corrupt nature,
sold as a slave to sin.
15 I don’t realize what I’m doing. I don’t
do what I want to do. Instead, I do what
I hate.ROMANS 7
33
16 I don’t do what I want to do, but I
agree that God’s standards are good.
17 So I am no longer the one who is
doing the things I hate, but sin that lives
in me is doing them.
18 I know that nothing good lives in me;
that is, nothing good lives in my corrupt
nature. Although I have the desire to do
what is right, I don’t do it.
19 I don’t do the good I want to do.
Instead, I do the evil that I don’t want to
do.
20 Now, when I do what I don’t want to
do, I am no longer the one who is doing
it. Sin that lives in me is doing it.
21 So I’ve discovered this truth: Evil is
present with me even when I want to do
what God’s standards say is good.
22 I take pleasure in God’s standards in
my inner being.
23 However, I see a diﬀerent standard at
work throughout my body. It is at warROMANS 7 – 8
34
with the standards my mind sets and
tries to take me cap ve to sin’s standards
which s ll exist throughout my body.
24 What a miserable person I am! Who
will rescue me from my dying body?
25 I thank God that our Lord Jesus
Christ rescues me! So I am obedient to
God’s standards with my mind, but I
am obedient to sin’s standards with my
corrupt nature.
1 So those who are believers in Christ
Jesus can no longer be condemned.
2 The standards of the Spirit, who gives
life through Christ Jesus, have set you
free from the standards of sin and death.
3 It is impossible to do what God’s
standards demand because of the
weakness our human nature has. But
God sent his Son to have a human nature
as sinners have and to pay for sin. That
way God condemned sin in our corrupt
nature.
8ROMANS 8
35
4 Therefore, we, who do not live by
our corrupt nature but by our spiritual
nature, are able to meet God’s standards.
5 Those who live by the corrupt nature
have the corrupt nature’s a tude. But
those who live by the spiritual nature
have the spiritual nature’s a tude.
6 The corrupt nature’s a tude leads to
death. But the spiritual nature’s a tude
leads to life and peace.
7 This is so because the corrupt nature
has a hos le a tude toward God.
It refuses to place itself under the
authority of God’s standards because it
can’t.
8 Those who are under the control of
the corrupt nature can’t please God.
9 But if God’s Spirit lives in you, you
are under the control of your spiritual
nature, not your corrupt nature.
Whoever doesn’t have the Spirit of
Christ doesn’t belong to him.ROMANS 8
36
10 However, if Christ lives in you, your
bodies are dead because of sin, but your
spirits are alive because you have God’s
approval.
11 Does the Spirit of the one who
brought Jesus back to life live in you?
Then the one who brought Christ back
to life will also make your mortal bodies
alive by his Spirit who lives in you.
12 So, brothers and sisters, we have no
obliga on to live the way our corrupt
nature wants us to live.
13 If you live by your corrupt nature,
you are going to die. But if you use your
spiritual nature to put to death the evil
ac vi es of the body, you will live.
14 Certainly, all who are guided by God’s
Spirit are God’s children.
15 You haven’t received the spirit of
slaves that leads you into fear again.
Instead, you have received the spirit ofROMANS 8
37
God’s adopted children by which we call
out, "Abba! Father!"
16 The Spirit himself tes ﬁes with our
spirit that we are God’s children.
17 If we are his children, we are also
God’s heirs. If we share in Christ’s
suﬀering in order to share his glory, we
are heirs together with him.
18 I consider our present suﬀerings
insigniﬁcant compared to the glory that
will soon be revealed to us.
19 All crea on is eagerly wai ng for God
to reveal who his children are.
20 Crea on was subjected to frustra on
but not by its own choice. The one who
subjected it to frustra on did so in the
hope
21 that it would also be set free from
slavery to decay in order to share the
glorious freedom that the children of
God will have.ROMANS 8
22 We know that all crea
38
on has been
groaning with the pains of childbirth up
to the present me.
23 However, not only crea on groans.
We, who have the Spirit as the ﬁrst
of God’s gi s, also groan inwardly.
We groan as we eagerly wait for our
adop on, the freeing of our bodies from
sin.
24 We were saved with this hope in
mind. If we hope for something we
already see, it’s not really hope. Who
hopes for what can be seen?
25 But if we hope for what we don’t see,
we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.
26 At the same me the Spirit also helps
us in our weakness, because we don’t
know how to pray for what we need.
But the Spirit intercedes along with
our groans that cannot be expressed in
words.ROMANS 8
39
27 The one who searches our hearts
knows what the Spirit has in mind. The
Spirit intercedes for God’s people the
way God wants him to.
28 We know that all things work
together for the good of those who
love God––those whom he has called
according to his plan.
29 This is true because he already knew
his people and had already appointed
them to have the same form as the
image of his Son. Therefore, his Son is
the ﬁrstborn among many children.
30 He also called those whom he had
already appointed. He approved of those
whom he had called, and he gave glory
to those whom he had approved of.
31 What can we say about all of this? If
God is for us, who can be against us?
32 God didn’t spare his own Son but
handed him over to death for all of us.ROMANS 8
40
So he will also give us everything along
with him.
33 Who will accuse those whom God
has chosen? God has approved of them.
34 Who will condemn them? Christ
has died, and more importantly, he
was brought back to life. Christ has the
highest posi on in heaven. Christ also
intercedes for us.
35 What will separate us from the love
Christ has for us? Can trouble, distress,
persecu on, hunger, nakedness, danger,
or violent death separate us from his
love?
36 As Scripture says: "We are being
killed all day long because of you. We are
thought of as sheep to be slaughtered."
37 The one who loves us gives us
an overwhelming victory in all these
diﬃcul es.
38 I am convinced that nothing can ever
separate us from God’s love which ChristROMANS 8 – 9
41
Jesus our Lord shows us. We can’t be
separated by death or life, by angels
or rulers, by anything in the present or
anything in the future, by forces
39 or powers in the world above or in
the world below, or by anything else in
crea on.
1 As a Chris an, I’m telling you the
truth. I’m not lying. The Holy Spirit,
along with my own thoughts, supports
me in this.
2 I have deep sorrow and endless
heartache.
3 I wish I could be condemned and cut
oﬀ from Christ for the sake of others
who, like me, are Jewish by birth.
4 They are Israelites, God’s adopted
children. They have the Lord’s glory,
the pledges, Moses’ Teachings, the true
worship, and the promises.
5 The Messiah is descended from their
ancestors according to his human nature.
9ROMANS 9
42
The Messiah is God over everything,
forever blessed. Amen.
6 Now it is not as though God’s word has
failed. Clearly, not everyone descended
from Israel is part of Israel
7 or a descendant of Abraham.
However, as Scripture says, "Through
Isaac your descendants will carry on
your name."
8 This means that children born by
natural descent from Abraham are not
necessarily God’s children. Instead,
children born by the promise are
considered Abraham’s descendants.
9 For example, this is what the promise
said, "I will come back at the right me,
and Sarah will have a son."
10 The same thing happened to
Rebekah. Rebekah became pregnant by
our ancestor Isaac.
11 Before the children had been born
or had done anything good or bad,ROMANS 9
43
Rebekah was told that the older child
would serve the younger one. This was
said to Rebekah so that God’s plan would
remain a ma er of his choice,
12 a choice based on God’s call and not
on anything people do.
13 The Scriptures say, "I loved Jacob, but
I hated Esau."
14 What can we say––that God is unfair?
That’s unthinkable!
15 For example, God said to Moses, "I
will be kind to anyone I want to. I will be
merciful to anyone I want to."
16 Therefore, God’s choice does not
depend on a person’s desire or eﬀort,
but on God’s mercy.
17 For example, Scripture says to
Pharaoh, "I put you here for this reason:
to demonstrate my power through you
and to spread my name throughout the
earth."ROMANS 9
44
18 Therefore, if God wants to be kind to
anyone, he will be. If he wants to make
someone stubborn, he will.
19 You may ask me, "Why does God s ll
ﬁnd fault with anyone? Who can resist
whatever God wants to do?"
20 Who do you think you are to talk
back to God like that? Can an object that
was made say to its maker, "Why did you
make me like this?"
21 A po er has the right to do whatever
he wants with his clay. He can make
something for a special occasion or
something for everyday use from the
same lump of clay.
22 If God wants to demonstrate his
anger and reveal his power, he can do
it. But can’t he be extremely pa ent
with people who are objects of his
anger because they are headed for
destruc on?ROMANS 9
45
23 Can’t God also reveal the riches of his
glory to people who are objects of his
mercy and who he had already prepared
for glory?
24 This is what God did for us whom he
called––whether we are Jews or not.
25 As God says in Hosea: "Those who
are not my people I will call my people.
Those who are not loved I will call my
loved ones.
26 Wherever they were told, ‘You are
not my people,’ they will be called
children of the living God."
27 Isaiah also says about Israel:
"Although the descendants of Israel are
as numerous as the grains of sand on the
seashore, only a few will be saved.
28 The Lord will carry out his sentence
on the land, completely and decisively."
29 This is what Isaiah predicted: "If
the Lord of Armies hadn’t le us someROMANS 9 – 10
46
descendants, we would have been like
Sodom and Gomorrah."
30 So what can we say? We can say that
non–Jewish people who were not trying
to gain God’s approval won his approval,
an approval based on faith.
31 The people of Israel tried to gain
God’s approval by obeying Moses’
Teachings, but they did not reach their
goal.
32 Why? They didn’t rely on faith to gain
God’s approval, but they relied on their
own eﬀorts. They stumbled over the
rock that trips people.
33 As Scripture says, "I am placing a
rock in Zion that people trip over, a large
rock that people ﬁnd oﬀensive. Whoever
believes in him will not be ashamed."
1 Brothers and sisters, my heart’s
desire and prayer to God on
behalf of the Jewish people is that they
would be saved.
10ROMANS 10
47
2 I can assure you that they are deeply
devoted to God, but they are misguided.
3 They don’t understand how to receive
God’s approval. So they try to set up
their own way to get it, and they have
not accepted God’s way for receiving his
approval.
4 Christ is the fulﬁllment of Moses’
Teachings so that everyone who has
faith may receive God’s approval.
5 Moses writes about receiving God’s
approval by following his laws. He says,
"The person who obeys laws will live
because of the laws he obeys."
6 However, Scripture says about God’s
approval which is based on faith, "Don’t
ask yourself who will go up to heaven,"
(that is, to bring Christ down).
7 "Don’t ask who will go down into the
depths," (that is, to bring Christ back
from the dead).ROMANS 10
48
8 However, what else does it say? "This
message is near you. It’s in your mouth
and in your heart." This is the message
of faith that we spread.
9 If you declare that Jesus is Lord, and
believe that God brought him back to
life, you will be saved.
10 By believing you receive God’s
approval, and by declaring your faith you
are saved.
11 Scripture says, "Whoever believes in
him will not be ashamed."
12 There is no diﬀerence between Jews
and Greeks. They all have the same Lord,
who gives his riches to everyone who
calls on him.
13 So then, "Whoever calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved."
14 But how can people call on him if
they have not believed in him? How
can they believe in him if they have notROMANS 10
49
heard his message? How can they hear if
no one tells the Good News?
15 How can people tell the Good News
if no one sends them? As Scripture
says, "How beau ful are the feet of the
messengers who announce the Good
News."
16 But not everyone has believed the
Good News. Isaiah asks, "Lord, who has
believed our message?"
17 So faith comes from hearing the
message, and the message that is heard
is what Christ spoke.
18 But I ask, "Didn’t they hear that
message?" Certainly they did! "The voice
of the messengers has gone out into the
whole world and their words to the ends
of the earth."
19 Again I ask, "Didn’t Israel understand
that message?" Moses was the ﬁrst to
say, "I will make you jealous of people
who are not a na on. I will make youROMANS 10 – 11
50
angry about a na on that doesn’t
understand."
20 Isaiah said very boldly, "I was found
by those who weren’t looking for me.
I was revealed to those who weren’t
asking for me."
21 Then Isaiah said about Israel, "All day
long I have stretched out my hands to
disobedient and rebellious people."
1 So I ask, "Has God rejected
his people Israel?" That’s
unthinkable! Consider this. I’m an
Israelite myself, a descendant of
Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God has not rejected his people whom
he knew long ago. Don’t you know what
Elijah says in the Scripture passage when
he complains to God about Israel? He
says,
3 "Lord, they’ve killed your prophets
and torn down your altars. I’m the only
11ROMANS 11
51
one le , and they’re trying to take my
life."
4 But what was God’s reply? God said,
"I’ve kept 7,000 people for myself who
have not knelt to worship Baal."
5 So, as there were then, there are now
a few le that God has chosen by his
kindness.
6 If they were chosen by God’s kindness,
they weren’t chosen because of anything
they did. Otherwise, God’s kindness
wouldn’t be kindness.
7 So what does all this mean? It means
that Israel has never achieved what it
has been striving for. However, those
whom God has chosen have achieved
it. The minds of the rest of Israel were
closed,
8 as Scripture says, "To this day God
has given them a spirit of deep sleep.
Their eyes don’t see, and their ears don’t
hear!"ROMANS 11
52
9 And David says, "Let the table set for
them become a trap and a net, a snare
and a punishment for them.
10 Let their vision become clouded so
that they cannot see. Let them carry
back–breaking burdens forever."
11 So I ask, "Has Israel stumbled so
badly that it can’t get up again?" That’s
unthinkable! By Israel’s failure, salva on
has come to people who are not Jewish
to make the Jewish people jealous.
12 The fall of the Jewish people made
the world spiritually rich. Their failure
made people who are not Jewish
spiritually rich. So the inclusion of Jewish
people will make the world even richer.
13 Now, I speak to you who are not
Jewish. As long as I am an apostle sent to
people who are not Jewish, I bring honor
to my ministry.
14 Perhaps I can make my people
jealous and save some of them.ROMANS 11
15 If Israel’s rejec
53
on means that the
world has been brought back to God,
what does Israel’s acceptance mean? It
means that Israel has come back to life.
16 If the ﬁrst handful of dough is holy,
the whole batch of dough is holy. If the
root is holy, the branches are holy.
17 But some of the olive branches have
been broken oﬀ, and you, a wild olive
branch, have been gra ed in their place.
You get your nourishment from the roots
of the olive tree.
18 So don’t brag about being be er
than the other branches. If you brag,
remember that you don’t support the
root, the root supports you.
19 "Well," you say, "Branches were cut
oﬀ so that I could be gra ed onto the
tree."
20 That’s right! They were broken oﬀ
because they didn’t believe, but you
remain on the tree because you doROMANS 11
54
believe. Don’t feel arrogant, but be
afraid.
21 If God didn’t spare the natural
branches, he won’t spare you, either.
22 Look at how kind and how severe
God can be. He is severe to those who
fell, but kind to you if you con nue to
hold on to his kindness. Otherwise, you,
too, will be cut oﬀ from the tree.
23 If Jewish people do not con nue in
their unbelief, they will be gra ed onto
the tree again, because God is able to do
that.
24 In spite of the fact that you have
been cut from a wild olive tree, you have
been gra ed onto a cul vated one. So
wouldn’t it be easier for these natural
branches to be gra ed onto the olive
tree they belong to?
25 Brothers and sisters, I want you to
understand this mystery so that you
won’t become arrogant. The minds ofROMANS 11
55
some Israelites have become closed
un l all of God’s non–Jewish people are
included.
26 In this way Israel as a whole will be
saved, as Scripture says, "The Savior
will come from Zion. He will remove
godlessness from Jacob.
27 My promise to them will be fulﬁlled
when I take away their sins."
28 The Good News made the Jewish
people enemies because of you. But by
God’s choice they are loved because of
their ancestors.
29 God never changes his mind when he
gives gi s or when he calls someone.
30 In the past, you disobeyed God.
But now God has been merciful to you
because of the disobedience of the
Jewish people.
31 In the same way, the Jewish people
have also disobeyed so that God may be
merciful to them as he was to you.ROMANS 11 – 12
56
32 God has placed all people into the
prison of their own disobedience so that
he could be merciful to all people.
33 God’s riches, wisdom, and knowledge
are so deep that it is impossible to
explain his decisions or to understand
his ways.
34 "Who knows how the Lord thinks?
Who can become his adviser?"
35 Who gave the Lord something which
the Lord must pay back?
36 Everything is from him and by him
and for him. Glory belongs to him
forever! Amen!
1 Brothers and sisters, in view
of all we have just shared about
God’s compassion, I encourage you to
oﬀer your bodies as living sacriﬁces,
dedicated to God and pleasing to him.
This kind of worship is appropriate for
you.
12ROMANS 12
57
2 Don’t become like the people of this
world. Instead, change the way you
think. Then you will always be able to
determine what God really wants––what
is good, pleasing, and perfect.
3 Because of the kindness that God
has shown me, I ask you not to think of
yourselves more highly than you should.
Instead, your thoughts should lead you
to use good judgment based on what
God has given each of you as believers.
4 Our bodies have many parts, but
these parts don’t all do the same thing.
5 In the same way, even though we are
many individuals, Christ makes us one
body and individuals who are connected
to each other.
6 God in his kindness gave each of us
diﬀerent gi s. If your gi is speaking
God’s word, make sure what you say
agrees with the Chris an faith.ROMANS 12
7 If your gi
58
is serving, then devote
yourself to serving. If it is teaching,
devote yourself to teaching.
8 If it is encouraging others, devote
yourself to giving encouragement. If it is
sharing, be generous. If it is leadership,
lead enthusias cally. If it is helping
people in need, help them cheerfully.
9 Love sincerely. Hate evil. Hold on to
what is good.
10 Be devoted to each other like a loving
family. Excel in showing respect for each
other.
11 Don’t be lazy in showing your
devo on. Use your energy to serve the
Lord.
12 Be happy in your conﬁdence, be
pa ent in trouble, and pray con nually.
13 Share what you have with God’s
people who are in need. Be hospitable.
14 Bless those who persecute you. Bless
them, and don’t curse them.ROMANS 12
59
15 Be happy with those who are happy.
Be sad with those who are sad.
16 Live in harmony with each other.
Don’t be arrogant, but be friendly to
humble people. Don’t think that you are
smarter than you really are.
17 Don’t pay people back with evil
for the evil they do to you. Focus your
thoughts on those things that are
considered noble.
18 As much as it is possible, live in peace
with everyone.
19 Don’t take revenge, dear friends.
Instead, let God’s anger take care of it.
A er all, Scripture says, "I alone have
the right to take revenge. I will pay back,
says the Lord."
20 But, "If your enemy is hungry, feed
him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink. If
you do this, you will make him feel guilty
and ashamed."ROMANS 12 – 13
60
21 Don’t let evil conquer you, but
conquer evil with good.
1 Every person should obey
the government in power. No
government would exist if it hadn’t been
established by God. The governments
which exist have been put in place by
God.
2 Therefore, whoever resists the
government opposes what God has
established. Those who resist will bring
punishment on themselves.
3 People who do what is right don’t
have to be afraid of the government. But
people who do what is wrong should
be afraid of it. Would you like to live
without being afraid of the government?
Do what is right, and it will praise you.
4 The government is God’s servant
working for your good. But if you do
what is wrong, you should be afraid. The
government has the right to carry out
13ROMANS 13
61
the death sentence. It is God’s servant,
an avenger to execute God’s anger on
anyone who does what is wrong.
5 Therefore, it is necessary for you to
obey, not only because you’re afraid of
God’s anger but also because of your
own conscience.
6 That is also why you pay your taxes.
People in the government are God’s
servants while they do the work he has
given them.
7 Pay everyone whatever you owe
them. If you owe taxes, pay them. If you
owe tolls, pay them. If you owe someone
respect, respect that person. If you owe
someone honor, honor that person.
8 Pay your debts as they come due.
However, one debt you can never ﬁnish
paying is the debt of love that you owe
each other. The one who loves another
person has fulﬁlled Moses’ Teachings.ROMANS 13
62
9 The commandments, "Never commit
adultery; never murder; never steal;
never have wrong desires," and every
other commandment are summed up in
this statement: "Love your neighbor as
you love yourself."
10 Love never does anything that is
harmful to a neighbor. Therefore, love
fulﬁlls Moses’ Teachings.
11 You know the mes in which we are
living. It’s me for you to wake up. Our
salva on is nearer now than when we
ﬁrst became believers.
12 The night is almost over, and the day
is near. So we should get rid of the things
that belong to the dark and take up the
weapons that belong to the light.
13 We should live decently, as people
who live in the light of day. Wild
par es, drunkenness, sexual immorality,
promiscuity, rivalry, and jealousy cannot
be part of our lives.ROMANS 13 – 14
63
14 Instead, live like the Lord Jesus Christ
did, and forget about sa sfying the
desires of your sinful nature.
1 Welcome people who are weak
in faith, but don’t get into an
argument over diﬀerences of opinion.
2 Some people believe that they can
eat all kinds of food. Other people with
weak faith believe that they can eat only
vegetables.
3 People who eat all foods should not
despise people who eat only vegetables.
In the same way, the vegetarians should
not cri cize people who eat all foods,
because God has accepted those people.
4 Who are you to cri cize someone
else’s servant? The Lord will determine
whether his servant has been successful.
The servant will be successful because
the Lord makes him successful.
5 One person decides that one day is
holier than another. Another person
14ROMANS 14
64
decides that all days are the same. Every
person must make his own decision.
6 When people observe a special day,
they observe it to honor the Lord. When
people eat all kinds of foods, they honor
the Lord as they eat, since they give
thanks to God. Vegetarians also honor
the Lord when they eat, and they, too,
give thanks to God.
7 It’s clear that we don’t live to honor
ourselves, and we don’t die to honor
ourselves.
8 If we live, we honor the Lord, and if
we die, we honor the Lord. So whether
we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
9 For this reason Christ died and came
back to life so that he would be the Lord
of both the living and the dead.
10 Why do you cri cize or despise other
Chris ans? Everyone will stand in front
of God to be judged.ROMANS 14
65
11 Scripture says, "As certainly as I live,
says the Lord, everyone will worship me,
and everyone will praise God."
12 All of us will have to give an account
of ourselves to God.
13 So let’s stop cri cizing each other.
Instead, you should decide never to
do anything that would make other
Chris ans have doubts or lose their faith.
14 The Lord Jesus has given me the
knowledge and convic on that no food
is unacceptable in and of itself. But it is
unacceptable to a person who thinks it
is.
15 So if what you eat hurts another
Chris an, you are no longer living by
love. Don’t destroy anyone by what you
eat. Christ died for that person.
16 Don’t allow anyone to say that what
you consider good is evil.
17 God’s kingdom does not consist of
what a person eats or drinks. Rather,ROMANS 14
66
God’s kingdom consists of God’s approval
and peace, as well as the joy that the
Holy Spirit gives.
18 The person who serves Christ with
this in mind is pleasing to God and
respected by people.
19 So let’s pursue those things which
bring peace and which are good for each
other.
20 Don’t ruin God’s work because of
what you eat. All food is acceptable, but
it’s wrong for a person to eat something
if it causes someone else to have doubts.
21 The right thing to do is to avoid ea ng
meat, drinking wine, or doing anything
else that causes another Chris an to
have doubts.
22 So whatever you believe about these
things, keep it between yourself and
God. The person who does what he
knows is right shouldn’t feel guilty. He is
blessed.ROMANS 14 – 15
23 But if a person has doubts and s
67
ll
eats, he is condemned because he didn’t
act in faith. Anything that is not done in
faith is sin.
1 So those of us who have a strong
faith must be pa ent with the
weaknesses of those whose faithis not
so strong. We must not think only of
ourselves.
2 We should all be concerned about our
neighbor and the good things that will
build his faith.
3 Christ did not think only of himself.
Rather, as Scripture says, "The insults of
those who insult you have fallen on me."
4 Everything wri en long ago was
wri en to teach us so that we would
have conﬁdence through the endurance
and encouragement which the Scriptures
give us.
5 May God, who gives you this
endurance and encouragement, allow
15ROMANS 15
68
you to live in harmony with each other
by following the example of Christ Jesus.
6 Then, having the same goal, you will
praise the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
7 Therefore, accept each other in the
same way that Christ accepted you. He
did this to bring glory to God.
8 Let me explain. Christ became a
servant for the Jewish people to reveal
God’s truth. As a result, he fulﬁlled God’s
promise to the ancestors of the Jewish
people.
9 People who are not Jewish praise God
for his mercy as well. This is what the
Scriptures say, "That is why I will give
thanks to you among the na ons and I
will sing praises to your name."
10 And Scripture says again, "You
na ons, be happy together with his
people!"ROMANS 15
69
11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all you
na ons! Praise him, all you people of the
world!"
12 Again, Isaiah says, "There will be a
root from Jesse. He will rise to rule the
na ons, and he will give the na ons
hope."
13 May God, the source of hope, ﬁll you
with joy and peace through your faith in
him. Then you will overﬂow with hope
by the power of the Holy Spirit.
14 I’m convinced, brothers and sisters,
that you, too, are ﬁlled with goodness.
I’m also convinced that you have all the
knowledge you need and that you are
able to instruct each other.
15 However, I’ve wri en you a le er,
parts of which are rather bold, as a
reminder to you. I’m doing this because
God gave me the gi
16 to be a servant of Christ Jesus to
people who are not Jewish. I serve as aROMANS 15
70
priest by spreading the Good News of
God. I do this in order that I might bring
the na ons to God as an acceptable
oﬀering, made holy by the Holy Spirit.
17 So Christ Jesus gives me the right to
brag about what I’m doing for God.
18 I’m bold enough to tell you only what
Christ has done through me to bring
people who are not Jewish to obedience.
By what I have said and done,
19 by the power of miraculous and
amazing signs, and by the power of God’s
Spirit, I have ﬁnished spreading the
Good News about Christ from Jerusalem
to Illyricum.
20 My goal was to spread the Good
News where the name of Christ was
not known. I didn’t want to build on a
founda on which others had laid.
21 As Scripture says, "Those who were
never told about him will see, and those
who never heard will understand."ROMANS 15
22 This is what has so o
71
en kept me
from visi ng you.
23 But now I have no new opportuni es
for work in this region. For many years I
have wanted to visit you.
24 Now I am on my way to Spain, so I
hope to see you when I come your way.
A er I have enjoyed your company for a
while, I hope that you will support my
trip to Spain.
25 Right now I’m going to Jerusalem to
bring help to the Chris ans there.
26 Because the believers in Macedonia
and Greece owe a debt to the Chris ans
in Jerusalem, they have decided to take
up a collec on for the poor among the
Chris ans in Jerusalem.
27 These Macedonians and Greeks
have shared the spiritual wealth of the
Chris ans in Jerusalem. So they are
obligated to use their earthly wealth to
help them.ROMANS 15 – 16
28 When the collec
72
on is completed
and I have oﬃcially turned the money
over to the Chris ans in Jerusalem, I will
visit you on my way to Spain.
29 I know that when I come to you I will
bring the full blessing of Christ.
30 Brothers and sisters, I encourage you
through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the
love that the Spirit creates, to join me in
my struggle. Pray to God for me
31 that I will be rescued from those
people in Judea who refuse to believe.
Pray that God’s people in Jerusalem will
accept the help I bring.
32 Also pray that by the will of God I may
come to you with joy and be refreshed
when I am with you.
33 May the God of peace be with you
all. Amen.
1 With this le er I’m introducing
Phoebe to you. She is our sister in
16ROMANS 16
73
the Chris an faith and a deacon of the
church in the city of Cenchrea.
2 Give her a Chris an welcome that
shows you are God’s holy people.
Provide her with anything she may need,
because she has provided help to many
people, including me.
3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my coworkers
in the service of Christ Jesus.
4 They risked their lives to save me.
I’m thankful to them and so are all the
churches among the na ons.
5 Also greet the church that meets
in their house. Greet my dear friend
Epaenetus. He was the ﬁrst person in the
province of Asia to become a believer in
Christ.
6 Greet Mary, who has worked very
hard for you.
7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, who
are Jewish by birth like me. They are
prisoners like me and are prominentROMANS 16
74
among the apostles. They also were
Chris ans before I was.
8 Greet Ampliatus my dear friend in the
service of the Lord.
9 Greet Urbanus our coworker in the
service of Christ, and my dear friend
Stachys.
10 Greet Apelles, a true Chris an. Greet
those who belong to the family of
Aristobulus.
11 Greet Herodion, who is Jewish by
birth like me. Greet those Chris ans who
belong to the family of Narcissus.
12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who
have worked hard for the Lord. Greet
dear Persis, who has worked very hard
for the Lord.
13 Greet Rufus, that outstanding
Chris an, and his mother, who has been
a mother to me too.ROMANS 16
75
14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes,
Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and
sisters who are with them.
15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus,
and his sister, and Olympas, and all God’s
people who are with them.
16 Greet each other with a holy kiss. All
the churches of Christ greet you.
17 Brothers and sisters, I urge you to
watch out for those people who create
divisions and who make others fall away
from the Chris an faith by teaching
doctrine that is not the same as you
have learned. Stay away from them.
18 People like these are not serving
Christ our Lord. They are serving their
own desires. By their smooth talk
and ﬂa ering words they deceive
unsuspec ng people.
19 Everyone has heard about your
obedience and this makes me happy forROMANS 16
76
you. I want you to do what is good and
to avoid what is evil.
20 The God of peace will quickly crush
Satan under your feet. May the good will
of our Lord Jesus be with you!
21 Timothy my coworker greets you; so
do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, who are
Jewish by birth like me.
22 I, Ter us, who wrote this le er, send
you Chris an gree ngs.
23 Gaius greets you. He is host to me
and the whole church. Erastus, the
city treasurer, greets you. Quartus, our
brother in the Chris an faith, greets you.

1 From Paul, called to be an apostle
of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
and from Sosthenes, our brother in the
Chris an faith.
2 To God’s church that was made holy
by Christ Jesus and called to be God’s
holy people in the city of Corinth and
to people everywhere who call on the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
4 I always thank God for you because
Christ Jesus has shown you God’s good
will.
5 Through Christ Jesus you have
become rich in every way––in speech
and knowledge of every kind.1 CORINTHIANS 1
2
6 Our message about Christ has been
veriﬁed among you.
7 Therefore, you don’t lack any gi as
you wait eagerly for our Lord Jesus Christ
to be revealed.
8 He will con nue to give you strength
un l the end so that no one can accuse
you of anything on the day of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
9 God faithfully keeps his promises. He
called you to be partners with his Son
Jesus Christ our Lord.
10 Brothers and sisters, I encourage all
of you in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ to agree with each other and not
to split into opposing groups. I want you
to be united in your understanding and
opinions.
11 Brothers and sisters, some people
from Chloe’s family have made it clear
to me that you are quarreling among
yourselves.1 CORINTHIANS 1
3
12 This is what I mean: Each of you
is saying, "I follow Paul," or "I follow
Apollos," or "I follow Cephas," or "I
follow Christ."
13 Has Christ been divided? Was Paul
cruciﬁed for you? Were you bap zed in
Paul’s name?
14 I thank God that I didn’t bap ze any
of you except Crispus and Gaius
15 so that no one can say you were
bap zed in my name.
16 I also bap zed Stephanas and
his family. Beyond that, I’m not sure
whether I bap zed anyone else.
17 Christ didn’t send me to bap ze.
Instead, he sent me to spread the
Good News. I didn’t use intellectual
arguments. That would have made the
cross of Christ lose its meaning.
18 The message about the cross is
nonsense to those who are being1 CORINTHIANS 1
4
destroyed, but it is God’s power to us
who are being saved.
19 Scripture says, "I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise. I will reject the
intelligence of intelligent people."
20 Where is the wise person? Where
is the scholar? Where is the persuasive
speaker of our me? Hasn’t God turned
the wisdom of the world into nonsense?
21 The world with its wisdom was
unable to recognize God in terms of his
own wisdom. So God decided to use the
nonsense of the Good News we speak to
save those who believe.
22 Jews ask for miraculous signs, and
Greeks look for wisdom,
23 but our message is that Christ was
cruciﬁed. This oﬀends Jewish people and
makes no sense to people who are not
Jewish.1 CORINTHIANS 1
5
24 But to those Jews and Greeks who
are called, he is Christ, God’s power and
God’s wisdom.
25 God’s nonsense is wiser than human
wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger
than human strength.
26 Brothers and sisters, consider what
you were when God called you to be
Chris ans. Not many of you were wise
from a human point of view. You were
not in powerful posi ons or in the upper
social classes.
27 But God chose what the world
considers nonsense to put wise people
to shame. God chose what the world
considers weak to put what is strong to
shame.
28 God chose what the world considers
ordinary and what it despises––what
it considers to be nothing––in order
to destroy what it considers to be
something.1 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
6
29 As a result, no one can brag in God’s
presence.
30 You are partners with Christ Jesus
because of God. Jesus has become
our wisdom sent from God, our
righteousness, our holiness, and our
ransom from sin.
31 As Scripture says, "Whoever brags
must brag about what the Lord has
done."
1 Brothers and sisters, when I came
to you, I didn’t speak about God’s
mystery as if it were some kind of
brilliant message or wisdom.
2 While I was with you, I decided to deal
with only one subject––Jesus Christ,
who was cruciﬁed.
3 When I came to you, I was weak. I was
afraid and very nervous.
4 I didn’t speak my message with
persuasive intellectual arguments. I
21 CORINTHIANS 2
7
spoke my message with a show of
spiritual power
5 so that your faith would not be based
on human wisdom but on God’s power.
6 However, we do use wisdom to speak
to those who are mature. It is a wisdom
that doesn’t belong to this world or to
the rulers of this world who are in power
today and gone tomorrow.
7 We speak about the mystery of God’s
wisdom. It is a wisdom that has been
hidden, which God had planned for our
glory before the world began.
8 Not one of the rulers of this world has
known it. If they had, they wouldn’t have
cruciﬁed the Lord of glory.
9 But as Scripture says: "No eye has
seen, no ear has heard, and no mind
has imagined the things that God has
prepared for those who love him."
10 God has revealed those things to
us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches1 CORINTHIANS 2
8
everything, especially the deep things of
God.
11 A er all, who knows everything
about a person except that person’s
own spirit? In the same way, no one has
known everything about God except
God’s Spirit.
12 Now, we didn’t receive the spirit
that belongs to the world. Instead, we
received the Spirit who comes from God
so that we could know the things which
God has freely given us.
13 We don’t speak about these things
using teachings that are based on
intellectual arguments like people do.
Instead, we use the Spirit’s teachings.
We explain spiritual things to those who
have the Spirit.
14 A person who isn’t spiritual doesn’t
accept the teachings of God’s Spirit.
He thinks they’re nonsense. He can’t1 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
9
understand them because a person must
be spiritual to evaluate them.
15 Spiritual people evaluate everything
but are subject to no one’s evalua on.
16 "Who has known the mind of
the Lord so that he can teach him?"
However, we have the mind of Christ.
1 Brothers and sisters, I couldn’t talk
to you as spiritual people but as
people s ll inﬂuenced by your corrupt
nature. You were infants in your faith in
Christ.
2 I gave you milk to drink. I didn’t give
you solid food because you weren’t
ready for it. Even now you aren’t ready
for it
3 because you’re s ll inﬂuenced by your
corrupt nature. When you are jealous
and quarrel among yourselves, aren’t
you inﬂuenced by your corrupt nature
and living by human standards?
31 CORINTHIANS 3
10
4 When some of you say, "I follow Paul"
and others say, "I follow Apollos," aren’t
you ac ng like sinful humans?
5 Who is Apollos? Who is Paul? They are
servants who helped you come to faith.
Each did what the Lord gave him to do.
6 I planted, and Apollos watered, but
God made it grow.
7 So neither the one who plants nor the
one who waters is important because
only God makes it grow.
8 The one who plants and the one who
waters have the same goal, and each will
receive a reward for his own work.
9 We are God’s coworkers. You are
God’s ﬁeld. You are God’s building.
10 As a skilled and experienced builder, I
used the gi that God gave me to lay the
founda on for that building. However,
someone else is building on it. Each
person must be careful how he builds on
it.1 CORINTHIANS 3
11 A
11
er all, no one can lay any other
founda on than the one that is already
laid, and that founda on is Jesus Christ.
12 People may build on this founda on
with gold, silver, precious stones, wood,
hay, or straw.
13 The day will make what each one
does clearly visible because ﬁre will
reveal it. That ﬁre will determine what
kind of work each person has done.
14 If what a person has built survives,
he will receive a reward.
15 If his work is burned up, he will suﬀer
the loss. However, he will be saved,
though it will be like going through a ﬁre.
16 Don’t you know that you are God’s
temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?
17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God
will destroy him because God’s temple is
holy. You are that holy temple!
18 Don’t deceive yourselves. If any of
you think you are wise in the ways of this1 CORINTHIANS 3 – 4
12
world, you should give up that wisdom
in order to become really wise.
19 The wisdom of this world is nonsense
in God’s sight. That’s why Scripture
says, "God catches the wise in their
cleverness."
20 Again Scripture says, "The Lord
knows that the thoughts of the wise are
pointless."
21 So don’t brag about people.
Everything belongs to you.
22 Whether it is Paul, Apollos, Cephas,
the world, life or death, present or
future things, everything belongs to you.
23 You belong to Christ, and Christ
belongs to God.
1 People should think of us as
servants of Christ and managers who
are entrusted with God’s mysteries.
2 Managers are required to be
trustworthy.
41 CORINTHIANS 4
3 It means very li
13
le to me that you or
any human court should cross–examine
me. I don’t even ask myself ques ons.
4 I have a clear conscience, but that
doesn’t mean I have God’s approval. It is
the Lord who cross–examines me.
5 Therefore, don’t judge anything
before the appointed me. Wait un l
the Lord comes. He will also bring to light
what is hidden in the dark and reveal
people’s mo ves. Then each person will
receive praise from God.
6 Brothers and sisters, I have applied
this to Apollos and myself for your
sake. You should learn from us not to
go beyond what is wri en in Scripture.
Then you won’t arrogantly place one of
us in opposi on to the other.
7 Who says that you are any be er than
other people? What do you have that
wasn’t given to you? If you were given1 CORINTHIANS 4
14
what you have, why are you bragging as
if it weren’t a gi ?
8 You already have what you want!
You’ve already become rich! You’ve
become kings without us! I wish you
really were kings so that we could be
kings with you.
9 As I see it, God has placed us apostles
last in line, like people condemned to
die. We have become a spectacle for
people and angels to look at.
10 We have given up our wisdom for
Christ, but you have insight because of
Christ. We are weak, but you are strong.
You are honored, but we are dishonored.
11 To this moment, we are hungry,
thirsty, poorly dressed, roughly treated,
and homeless.
12 We wear ourselves out doing physical
labor. When people verbally abuse us,
we bless them. When people persecute
us, we endure it.1 CORINTHIANS 4
13 When our reputa
15
ons are a acked,
we remain courteous. Right now we
have become garbage in the eyes of the
world and trash in the sight of all people.
14 I’m not wri ng this to make you feel
ashamed but to instruct you as my dear
children.
15 You may have countless Chris an
guardians, but you don’t have many
spiritual fathers. I became your father in
the Chris an life by telling you the Good
News about Christ Jesus.
16 So I encourage you to imitate me.
17 That’s why I’ve sent Timothy to you
to help you remember my Chris an way
of life as I teach it everywhere in every
church. Timothy is my dear child, and he
faithfully does the Lord’s work.
18 Some of you have become arrogant
because you think I won’t pay you a visit.
19 If it’s the Lord’s will, I’ll visit you
soon. Then I’ll know what these arrogant1 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
16
people are saying and what power they
have.
20 God’s kingdom is not just talk, it is
power.
21 When I come to visit you, would you
prefer that I punish you or show you love
and a gentle spirit?
1 Your own members are aware that
there is sexual sin going on among
them. This kind of sin is not even heard
of among unbelievers––a man is actually
married to his father’s wife.
2 You’re being arrogant when you
should have been more upset about this.
If you had been upset, the man who did
this would have been removed from
among you.
3 Although I’m not physically present
with you, I am with you in spirit. I have
already judged the man who did this as
though I were present with you.
51 CORINTHIANS 5
17
4 When you have gathered together, I
am with you in spirit. Then, in the name
of our Lord Jesus, and with his power,
5 hand such a person over to Satan to
destroy his corrupt nature so that his
spiritual nature may be saved on the day
of the Lord.
6 It’s not good for you to brag. Don’t
you know that a li le yeast spreads
through the whole batch of dough?
7 Remove the old yeast of sin so that
you may be a new batch of dough, since
you don’t actually have the yeast of sin.
Christ, our Passover lamb, has been
sacriﬁced.
8 So we must not celebrate our fes val
with the old yeast of sin or with the
yeast of vice and wickedness. Instead,
we must celebrate it with the bread of
purity and truth that has no yeast.1 CORINTHIANS 5
9 In my le
18
er to you I told you not to
associate with people who con nue to
commit sexual sins.
10 I didn’t tell you that you could not
have any contact with unbelievers who
commit sexual sins, are greedy, are
dishonest, or worship false gods. If that
were the case, you would have to leave
this world.
11 Now, what I meant was that you
should not associate with people who
call themselves brothers or sisters in the
Chris an faith but live in sexual sin, are
greedy, worship false gods, use abusive
language, get drunk, or are dishonest.
Don’t eat with such people.
12 A er all, do I have any business
judging those who are outside the
Chris an faith? Isn’t it your business to
judge those who are inside?1 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
19
13 God will judge those who are outside.
Remove that wicked man from among
you.
1 When one of you has a complaint
against another, how dare you go
to court to se le the ma er in front of
wicked people. Why don’t you se le it in
front of God’s holy people?
2 Don’t you know that God’s people will
judge the world? So if you’re going to
judge the world, aren’t you capable of
judging insigniﬁcant cases?
3 Don’t you know that we will judge
angels, not to men on things in this life?
4 When you have cases dealing with
this life, why do you allow people whom
the church has a low opinion of to be
your judges?
5 You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Don’t you have at least one wise person
who is able to se le disagreements
between believers?
61 CORINTHIANS 6
20
6 Instead, one believer goes to court
against another believer, and this
happens in front of unbelievers.
7 You are already totally defeated
because you have lawsuits against each
other. Why don’t you accept the fact
that you have been wronged? Why don’t
you accept that you have been cheated?
8 Instead, you do wrong and cheat, and
you do this to other believers.
9 Don’t you know that wicked people
won’t inherit the kingdom of God?
Stop deceiving yourselves! People who
con nue to commit sexual sins, who
worship false gods, those who commit
adultery, homosexuals,
10 or thieves, those who are greedy
or drunk, who use abusive language,
or who rob people will not inherit the
kingdom of God.
11 That’s what some of you were! But
you have been washed and made holy,1 CORINTHIANS 6
21
and you have received God’s approval in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in
the Spirit of our God.
12 Someone may say, "I’m allowed to do
anything," but not everything is helpful.
I’m allowed to do anything, but I won’t
allow anything to gain control over my
life.
13 Food is for the stomach, and the
stomach is for food, but God will put an
end to both of them. However, the body
is not for sexual sin but for the Lord, and
the Lord is for the body.
14 God raised the Lord, and by his
power God will also raise us.
15 Don’t you realize that your bodies
are parts of Christ’s body? Should I take
the parts of Christ’s body and make
them parts of a pros tute’s body? That’s
unthinkable!
16 Don’t you realize that the person
who unites himself with a pros tute1 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
22
becomes one body with her? God says,
"The two will be one."
17 However, the person who unites
himself with the Lord becomes one spirit
with him.
18 Stay away from sexual sins. Other
sins that people commit don’t aﬀect
their bodies the same way sexual sins
do. People who sin sexually sin against
their own bodies.
19 Don’t you know that your body is a
temple that belongs to the Holy Spirit?
The Holy Spirit, whom you received from
God, lives in you. You don’t belong to
yourselves.
20 You were bought for a price. So bring
glory to God in the way you use your
body.
1 Now, concerning the things that
you wrote about: It’s good for men
not to get married.
71 CORINTHIANS 7
23
2 But in order to avoid sexual sins, each
man should have his own wife, and each
woman should have her own husband.
3 Husbands and wives should sa sfy
each other’s sexual needs.
4 A wife doesn’t have authority over
her own body, but her husband does. In
the same way, a husband doesn’t have
authority over his own body, but his wife
does.
5 Don’t withhold yourselves from each
other unless you agree to do so for a
set me to devote yourselves to prayer.
Then you should get back together
so that Satan doesn’t use your lack of
self–control to tempt you.
6 What I have just said is not meant as a
command but as a sugges on.
7 I would like everyone to be like me.
However, each person has a special gi
from God, and these gi s vary from
person to person.1 CORINTHIANS 7
24
8 I say to those who are not married,
especially to widows: It is good for you
to stay single like me.
9 However, if you cannot control your
desires, you should get married. It is
be er for you to marry than to burn with
sexual desire.
10 I pass this command along (not really
I, but the Lord): A wife shouldn’t leave
her husband.
11 If she does, she should stay single or
make up with her husband. Likewise, a
husband should not divorce his wife.
12 I (not the Lord) say to the rest of
you: If any Chris an man is married to
a woman who is an unbeliever, and she
is willing to live with him, he should not
divorce her.
13 If any Chris an woman is married to
a man who is an unbeliever, and he is
willing to live with her, she should not
divorce her husband.1 CORINTHIANS 7
25
14 Actually, the unbelieving husband is
made holy because of his wife, and an
unbelieving wife is made holy because of
her husband. Otherwise, their children
would be unacceptable to God, but now
they are acceptable to him.
15 But if the unbelieving partners leave,
let them go. Under these circumstances
a Chris an man or Chris an woman is
not bound by a marriage vow. God has
called you to live in peace.
16 How do you as a wife know whether
you will save your husband? How do you
as a husband know whether you will
save your wife?
17 Everyone should live the life that the
Lord gave him when God called him. This
is the guideline I use in every church.
18 Any man who was already
circumcised when he was called to
be a Chris an shouldn’t undo his
circumcision. Any man who was1 CORINTHIANS 7
26
uncircumcised when he was called to be
a Chris an shouldn’t get circumcised.
19 Circumcision is nothing, and the lack
of it is nothing. But keeping what God
commands is everything.
20 All people should stay as they were
when they were called.
21 Were you a slave when you were
called? That shouldn’t bother you.
However, if you have a chance to
become free, take it.
22 If the Lord called you when you were
a slave, you are the Lord’s free person.
In the same way, if you were free when
you were called, you are Christ’s slave.
23 You were bought for a price. Don’t
become anyone’s slaves.
24 Brothers and sisters, you should
remain in whatever circumstances you
were in when God called you. God is
with you in those circumstances.1 CORINTHIANS 7
27
25 Concerning virgins: Even though I
don’t have any command from the Lord,
I’ll give you my opinion. I’m a person to
whom the Lord has shown mercy, so I
can be trusted.
26 Because of the present crisis I believe
it is good for people to remain as they
are.
27 Do you have a wife? Don’t seek a
divorce. Are you divorced from your
wife? Don’t look for another one.
28 But if you do get married, you have
not sinned. If a virgin gets married, she
has not sinned. However, these people
will have trouble, and I would like to
spare them from that.
29 This is what I mean, brothers and
sisters: The me has been shortened.
While it lasts, those who are married
should live as though they were not.
30 Those who have eyes ﬁlled with
tears should live as though they have1 CORINTHIANS 7
28
no sorrow. Those who are happy should
live as though there was nothing to be
happy about. Those who buy something
should live as though they didn’t own it.
31 Those who use the things in this
world should do so but not depend on
them. It is clear that this world in its
present form is passing away.
32 So I don’t want you to have
any concerns. An unmarried man is
concerned about the things of the Lord,
that is, about how he can please the
Lord.
33 But the married man is concerned
about earthly things, that is, about how
he can please his wife.
34 His a en on is divided. An unmarried
woman or a virgin is concerned about
the Lord’s things so that she may be holy
in body and in spirit. But the married
woman is concerned about earthly1 CORINTHIANS 7
29
things, that is, about how she can please
her husband.
35 I’m saying this for your beneﬁt, not
to restrict you. I’m showing you how to
live a noble life of devo on to the Lord
without being distracted by other things.
36 No father would want to do the
wrong thing when his virgin daughter is
old enough to get married. If she wants
to get married, he isn’t sinning by le ng
her get married.
37 However, a father may have come
to a decision about his daughter. If his
decision is to keep her at home because
she doesn’t want to get married, that’s
ﬁne.
38 So it’s ﬁne for a father to give his
daughter in marriage, but the father who
doesn’t give his daughter in marriage
does even be er.
39 A married woman must remain
with her husband as long as he lives. If1 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
30
her husband dies, she is free to marry
anyone she wishes, but only if the man
is a Chris an.
40 However, she will be more blessed if
she stays as she is. That is my opinion,
and I think that I, too, have God’s Spirit.
1 Now, concerning food oﬀered to
false gods: We know that we all have
knowledge. Knowledge makes people
arrogant, but love builds them up.
2 Those who think they know something
s ll have a lot to learn.
3 But if they love God, they are known
by God.
4 Now about ea ng food that was
oﬀered to false gods: We know that the
false gods in this world don’t really exist
and that no god exists except the one
God.
5 People may say that there are gods in
heaven and on earth––many gods and
many lords, as they would call them.
81 CORINTHIANS 8
31
6 But for us, "There is only one God, the
Father. Everything came from him, and
we live for him. There is only one Lord,
Jesus Christ. Everything came into being
through him, and we live because of
him."
7 But not everyone knows this. Some
people are so used to worshiping false
gods that they believe they are ea ng
food oﬀered to a false god. So they feel
guilty because their conscience is weak.
8 Food will not aﬀect our rela onship
with God. We are no worse oﬀ if we eat
that food and no be er oﬀ if we don’t.
9 But be careful that by using your
freedom you don’t somehow make a
believer who is weak in faith fall into sin.
10 For example, suppose someone with
a weak conscience sees you, who have
this knowledge, ea ng in the temple of
a false god. Won’t you be encouraging1 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
32
that person to eat food oﬀered to a false
god?
11 In that case, your knowledge is
ruining a believer whose faith is weak, a
believer for whom Christ died.
12 When you sin against other believers
in this way and harm their weak
consciences, you are sinning against
Christ.
13 Therefore, if ea ng food oﬀered to
false gods causes other believers to lose
their faith, I will never eat that kind of
food so that I won’t make other believers
lose their faith.
1 Don’t you agree that I’m a free
man? Don’t you agree that I’m an
apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord?
Aren’t you the result of my work for the
Lord?
2 If I’m not an apostle to other people,
at least I’m an apostle to you. You are the
91 CORINTHIANS 9
33
seal which proves that I am the Lord’s
apostle.
3 This is how I defend myself to those
who cross–examine me.
4 Don’t we have the right to eat and
drink?
5 Don’t we have the right to take
our wives along with us like the other
apostles, the Lord’s brothers, and Cephas
do?
6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who don’t
have any rights, except to ﬁnd work to
support ourselves?
7 Does a soldier ever serve in the army
at his own expense? Does anyone plant
a vineyard and not eat the grapes? Does
anyone take care of a ﬂock and not drink
milk from the sheep?
8 Am I merely sta ng some human rule?
Don’t Moses’ Teachings say the same
thing?1 CORINTHIANS 9
34
9 Moses’ Teachings say, "Never muzzle
an ox when it is threshing grain." God’s
concern isn’t for oxen.
10 Isn’t he speaking en rely for our
beneﬁt? This was wri en for our
beneﬁt so that the person who plows
or threshes should expect to receive a
share of the crop.
11 If we have planted the spiritual seed
that has been of beneﬁt to you, is it too
much if we receive part of the harvest
from your earthly goods?
12 If others have the right to expect this
from you, don’t we deserve even more?
But we haven’t used our rights. Instead,
we would put up with anything in order
not to hinder the Good News of Christ in
any way.
13 Don’t you realize that those who
work at the temple get their food from
the temple? Don’t those who help at the
altar get a share of what is on the altar?1 CORINTHIANS 9
35
14 In the same way, the Lord has
commanded that those who spread the
Good News should earn their living from
the Good News.
15 I haven’t used any of these rights,
and I haven’t wri en this in order to
use them now. I would rather die than
have anyone turn my bragging into
meaningless words.
16 If I spread the Good News, I have
nothing to brag about because I have
an obliga on to do this. How horrible it
will be for me if I don’t spread the Good
News!
17 If I spread the Good News willingly,
I’ll have a reward. But if I spread the
Good News unwillingly, I’m only doing
what I’ve been entrusted to do.
18 So what is my reward? It is to spread
the Good News free of charge. In that
way I won’t use the rights that belong to
those who spread the Good News.1 CORINTHIANS 9
36
19 Although I’m free from all people, I
have made myself a slave for all people
to win more of them.
20 I became Jewish for Jewish people. I
became subject to Moses’ Teachings for
those who are subject to those laws. I
did this to win them even though I’m not
subject to Moses’ Teachings.
21 I became like a person who does not
have Moses’ Teachings for those who
don’t have those teachings. I did this
to win them even though I have God’s
teachings. I’m really subject to Christ’s
teachings.
22 I became like a person weak in faith
to win those who are weak in faith. I
have become everything to everyone in
order to save at least some of them.
23 I do all this for the sake of the Good
News in order to share what it oﬀers.
24 Don’t you realize that everyone who
runs in a race runs to win, but only one1 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
37
runner gets the prize? Run like them, so
that you can win.
25 Everyone who enters an athle c
contest goes into strict training. They do
it to win a temporary crown, but we do
it to win one that will be permanent.
26 So I run––but not without a clear
goal ahead of me. So I box––but not as if
I were just shadow boxing.
27 Rather, I toughen my body with
punches and make it my slave so that
I will not be disqualiﬁed a er I have
spread the Good News to others.
1 I want you to know, brothers
and sisters, that all our ancestors
who le Egypt were under the cloud,
and they all went through the sea.
2 They were all united with Moses by
bap sm in the cloud and in the sea.
3 All of them ate the same spiritual
food,
101 CORINTHIANS 10
38
4 and all of them drank the same
spiritual drink. They drank from the
spiritual rock that went with them, and
that rock was Christ.
5 Yet, God was not pleased with most
of them, so their dead bodies were
sca ered over the desert.
6 These things have become examples
for us so that we won’t desire what is
evil, as they did.
7 So don’t worship false gods as some of
them did, as Scripture says, "The people
sat down to a feast which turned into an
orgy."
8 We shouldn’t sin sexually as some of
them did. Twenty–three thousand of
them died on one day.
9 We shouldn’t put the Lord to the test
as some of them did. They were killed by
snakes.
10 Don’t complain as some of them did.
The angel of death destroyed them.1 CORINTHIANS 10
39
11 These things happened to make
them an example for others. These
things were wri en down as a warning
for us who are living in the closing days
of history.
12 So, people who think they are
standing ﬁrmly should be careful that
they don’t fall.
13 There isn’t any tempta on that you
have experienced which is unusual
for humans. God, who faithfully keeps
his promises, will not allow you to be
tempted beyond your power to resist.
But when you are tempted, he will
also give you the ability to endure the
tempta on as your way of escape.
14 Therefore, my dear friends, get as far
away from the worship of false gods as
you can.
15 I’m talking to intelligent people.
Judge for yourselves what I’m saying.1 CORINTHIANS 10
40
16 When we bless the cup of blessing
aren’t we sharing in the blood of Christ?
When we break the bread aren’t we
sharing in the body of Christ?
17 Because there is one loaf, we are one
body, although we are many individuals.
All of us share one loaf.
18 Look at the people of Israel from a
human point of view. Don’t those who
eat the sacriﬁces share what is on the
altar?
19 Do I mean that an oﬀering made to a
false god is anything, or that a false god
itself is anything?
20 Hardly! What I am saying is that
these sacriﬁces which people make are
made to demons and not to God. I don’t
want you to be partners with demons.
21 You cannot drink the Lord’s cup
and the cup of demons. You cannot
par cipate at the table of the Lord and
at the table of demons.1 CORINTHIANS 10
41
22 Are we trying to make the Lord
jealous? Are we stronger than he is?
23 Someone may say, "I’m allowed to do
anything," but not everything is helpful.
I’m allowed to do anything, but not
everything encourages growth.
24 People should be concerned about
others and not just about themselves.
25 Eat anything that is sold in the market
without le ng your conscience trouble
you.
26 Certainly, "The earth is the Lord’s and
everything it contains is his."
27 If an unbeliever invites you to his
house for dinner, and you wish to go, eat
anything he serves you without le ng
your conscience trouble you.
28 However, if someone says to you,
"This was sacriﬁced to a god," don’t eat
it because of the one who informed you
and because of conscience.1 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
42
29 I’m not talking about your conscience
but the other person’s conscience.
Why should my freedom be judged by
someone else’s conscience?
30 If I give thanks to God for the food I
eat, why am I condemned for that?
31 So, whether you eat or drink, or
whatever you do, do everything to the
glory of God.
32 Don’t cause others to stumble,
whether they are Jewish, Greek, or
members of God’s church.
33 I try to please everyone in every way.
I don’t think about what would be good
for me but about what would be good
for many people so that they might be
saved.
1 Imitate me as I imitate Christ.
2 I praise you for always thinking
about me and for carefully following the
tradi ons that I handed down to you.
111 CORINTHIANS 11
43
3 However, I want you to realize that
Christ has authority over every man, a
husband has authority over his wife, and
God has authority over Christ.
4 Every man who covers his head
when he prays or speaks what God has
revealed dishonors the one who has
authority over him.
5 Every woman who prays or speaks
what God has revealed and has her head
uncovered while she speaks dishonors
the one who has authority over her. She
is like the woman who has her head
shaved.
6 So if a woman doesn’t cover her
head, she should cut oﬀ her hair. If it’s a
disgrace for a woman to cut oﬀ her hair
or shave her head, she should cover her
head.
7 A man should not cover his head. He
is God’s image and glory. The woman,
however, is man’s glory.1 CORINTHIANS 11
44
8 Clearly, man wasn’t made from
woman but woman from man.
9 Man wasn’t created for woman but
woman for man.
10 Therefore, a woman should wear
something on her head to show she
is under someone’s authority, out of
respect for the angels.
11 Yet, as believers in the Lord, women
couldn’t exist without men and men
couldn’t exist without women.
12 As a woman came into existence
from a man, so men come into existence
by women, but everything comes from
God.
13 Judge your own situa on. Is it proper
for a woman to pray to God with her
head uncovered?
14 Doesn’t nature itself teach you that
it is disgraceful for a man to have long
hair?1 CORINTHIANS 11
45
15 Doesn’t it teach you that it is a
woman’s pride to wear her hair long?
Her hair is given to her in place of a
covering.
16 If anyone wants to argue about this
they can’t, because we don’t have any
custom like this––nor do any of the
churches of God.
17 I have no praise for you as I instruct
you in the following ma er: When you
gather, it results in more harm than
good.
18 In the ﬁrst place, I hear that when
you gather as a church you split up into
opposing groups. I believe some of what
I hear.
19 Fac ons have to exist in order to
make it clear who the genuine believers
among you are.
20 When you gather in the same place,
you can’t possibly be ea ng the Lord’s
Supper.1 CORINTHIANS 11
46
21 Each of you eats his own supper
without wai ng for each other. So one
person goes hungry and another gets
drunk.
22 Don’t you have homes in which to
eat and drink? Do you despise God’s
church and embarrass people who don’t
have anything to eat? What can I say to
you? Should I praise you? I won’t praise
you for this.
23 A er all, I passed on to you what I
had received from the Lord. On the night
he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took
bread
24 and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving.
He broke the bread and said, "This is my
body, which is given for you. Do this to
remember me."
25 When supper was over, he did the
same with the cup. He said, "This cup is
the new promise made with my blood.1 CORINTHIANS 11
47
Every me you drink from it, do it to
remember me."
26 Every me you eat this bread and
drink from this cup, you tell about the
Lord’s death un l he comes.
27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread
or drinks from the Lord’s cup in an
improper way will be held responsible
for the Lord’s body and blood.
28 With this in mind, individuals must
determine whether what they are doing
is proper when they eat the bread and
drink from the cup.
29 Anyone who eats and drinks is ea ng
and drinking a judgment against himself
when he doesn’t recognize the Lord’s
body.
30 This is the reason why many of you
are weak and sick and quite a number of
you have died.
31 If we were judging ourselves
correctly, we would not be judged.1 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
48
32 But when the Lord judges us, he
disciplines us so that we won’t be
condemned along with the rest of the
world.
33 Therefore, brothers and sisters, when
you gather to eat, wait for each other.
34 Whoever is hungry should eat at
home so that you don’t have a gathering
that brings judgment on you. I will give
direc ons concerning the other ma ers
when I come.
1 Brothers and sisters, I don’t want
there to be any misunderstanding
concerning spiritual gi s.
2 You know that when you were
unbelievers, every me you were led to
worship false gods you were worshiping
gods who couldn’t even speak.
3 So I want you to know that no one
speaking by God’s Spirit says, "Jesus is
cursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord,"
except by the Holy Spirit.
121 CORINTHIANS 12
4 There are diﬀerent spiritual gi
49
s, but
the same Spirit gives them.
5 There are diﬀerent ways of serving,
and yet the same Lord is served.
6 There are diﬀerent types of work to
do, but the same God produces every
gi in every person.
7 The evidence of the Spirit’s presence
is given to each person for the common
good of everyone.
8 The Spirit gives one person the ability
to speak with wisdom. The same Spirit
gives another person the ability to speak
with knowledge.
9 To another person the same Spirit
gives courageous faith. To another
person the same Spirit gives the ability
to heal.
10 Another can work miracles. Another
can speak what God has revealed.
Another can tell the diﬀerence between
spirits. Another can speak in diﬀerent1 CORINTHIANS 12
50
kinds of languages. Another can
interpret languages.
11 There is only one Spirit who does all
these things by giving what God wants
to give to each person.
12 For example, the body is one unit
and yet has many parts. As all the parts
form one body, so it is with Christ.
13 By one Spirit we were all bap zed
into one body. Whether we are Jewish
or Greek, slave or free, God gave all of us
one Spirit to drink.
14 As you know, the human body is not
made up of only one part, but of many
parts.
15 Suppose a foot says, "I’m not a hand,
so I’m not part of the body!" Would that
mean it’s no longer part of the body?
16 Or suppose an ear says, "I’m not
an eye, so I’m not a part of the body!"
Would that mean it’s no longer part of
the body?1 CORINTHIANS 12
51
17 If the whole body were an eye, how
could it hear? If the whole body were an
ear, how could it smell?
18 So God put each and every part of
the body together as he wanted it.
19 How could it be a body if it only had
one part?
20 So there are many parts but one
body.
21 An eye can’t say to a hand, "I don’t
need you!" Or again, the head can’t say
to the feet, "I don’t need you!"
22 The opposite is true. The parts of the
body that we think are weaker are the
ones we really need.
23 The parts of the body that we think
are less honorable are the ones we give
special honor. So our unpresentable
parts are made more presentable.
24 However, our presentable parts don’t
need this kind of treatment. God has1 CORINTHIANS 12
52
put the body together and given special
honor to the part that doesn’t have it.
25 God’s purpose was that the body
should not be divided but rather that all
of its parts should feel the same concern
for each other.
26 If one part of the body suﬀers, all
the other parts share its suﬀering. If one
part is praised, all the others share in its
happiness.
27 You are Christ’s body and each of you
is an individual part of it.
28 In the church God has appointed ﬁrst
apostles, next prophets, third teachers,
then those who perform miracles, then
those who have the gi of healing, then
those who help others, those who are
managers, and those who can speak in a
number of languages.
29 Not all believers are apostles, are
they? Are all of them prophets? Do all1 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
53
of them teach? Do all of them perform
miracles
30 or have gi s of healing? Can all
of them speak in other languages or
interpret languages?
31 You only want the be er gi s, but I
will show you the best thing to do.
1 I may speak in the languages
of humans and of angels. But if I
don’t have love, I am a loud gong or a
clashing cymbal.
2 I may have the gi to speak what
God has revealed, and I may understand
all mysteries and have all knowledge. I
may even have enough faith to move
mountains. But if I don’t have love, I am
nothing.
3 I may even give away all that I have
and give up my body to be burned. But
if I don’t have love, none of these things
will help me.
131 CORINTHIANS 13
4 Love is pa
54
ent. Love is kind. Love isn’t
jealous. It doesn’t sing its own praises. It
isn’t arrogant.
5 It isn’t rude. It doesn’t think about
itself. It isn’t irritable. It doesn’t keep
track of wrongs.
6 It isn’t happy when injus ce is done,
but it is happy with the truth.
7 Love never stops being pa ent, never
stops believing, never stops hoping,
never gives up.
8 Love never comes to an end. There
is the gi of speaking what God has
revealed, but it will no longer be used.
There is the gi of speaking in other
languages, but it will stop by itself. There
is the gi of knowledge, but it will no
longer be used.
9 Our knowledge is incomplete and our
ability to speak what God has revealed is
incomplete.1 CORINTHIANS 13 – 14
55
10 But when what is complete comes,
then what is incomplete will no longer
be used.
11 When I was a child, I spoke like a
child, thought like a child, and reasoned
like a child. When I became an adult, I
no longer used childish ways.
12 Now we see a blurred image in a
mirror. Then we will see very clearly.
Now my knowledge is incomplete. Then
I will have complete knowledge as God
has complete knowledge of me.
13 So these three things remain: faith,
hope, and love. But the best one of
these is love.
1 Pursue love, and desire spiritual
gi s, but especially the gi of
speaking what God has revealed.
2 When a person speaks in another
language, he doesn’t speak to people
but to God. No one understands him. His
spirit is speaking mysteries.
141 CORINTHIANS 14
56
3 But when a person speaks what God
has revealed, he speaks to people to
help them grow, to encourage them, and
to comfort them.
4 When a person speaks in another
language, he helps himself grow. But
when a person speaks what God has
revealed, he helps the church grow.
5 I wish that all of you could speak in
other languages, but especially that you
could speak what God has revealed.
The person who speaks what God has
revealed is more important than the
person who speaks in other languages.
This is true unless he can interpret what
he says to help the church grow.
6 Brothers and sisters, it wouldn’t do
you any good if I came to you speaking
in other languages, unless I explained
revela on, knowledge, prophecy, or
doctrine to you.1 CORINTHIANS 14
57
7 Musical instruments like the ﬂute
or harp produce sounds. If there is
no diﬀerence in the notes, how can a
person tell what tune is being played?
8 For example, if the trumpet doesn’t
sound a clear call, who will get ready for
ba le?
9 In the same way, if you don’t speak in
a way that can be understood, how will
anyone know what you’re saying? You
will be talking into thin air.
10 No ma er how many diﬀerent
languages there are in the world, not
one of them is without meaning.
11 If I don’t know what a language
means, I will be a foreigner to the person
who speaks it and that person will be a
foreigner to me.
12 In the same way, since you’re eager
to have spiritual gi s, try to excel in
them so that you help the church grow.1 CORINTHIANS 14
58
13 So the person who speaks in
another language should pray for an
interpreta on of what he says.
14 If I pray in another language, my spirit
prays, but my mind is not produc ve.
15 So what does this mean? It means
that I will pray with my spirit, and I will
pray with my mind. I will sing psalms
with my spirit, and I will sing psalms with
my mind.
16 Otherwise, if you praise God only
with your spirit, how can outsiders say
"Amen!" to your prayer of thanksgiving?
They don’t know what you’re saying.
17 Your prayer of thanksgiving may be
very good, but it doesn’t help other
people grow.
18 I thank God that I speak in other
languages more than any of you.
19 Yet, in order to teach others in
church, I would rather say ﬁve words1 CORINTHIANS 14
59
that can be understood than ten
thousand words in another language.
20 Brothers and sisters, don’t think like
children. When it comes to evil, be like
babies, but think like mature people.
21 God’s word says, "Through people
who speak foreign languages and
through the mouths of foreigners I will
speak to these people, but even then
they will not listen to me, says the Lord."
22 So the gi of speaking in other
languages is a sign for unbelievers, not
for believers. The gi of speaking what
God had revealed is a sign for believers,
not for unbelievers.
23 Suppose the whole congrega on
gathers in the same place and you speak
in other languages. When outsiders or
unbelievers come in, won’t they say that
you’re out of your mind?
24 Now suppose you speak what God
has revealed. When unbelievers or1 CORINTHIANS 14
60
outsiders come in you will show them
where they are wrong and convince
them that they are sinners.
25 The secrets in their hearts will
become known, and in this way they will
quickly bow with their faces touching
the ground, worship God, and confess
that God is truly among you.
26 So what does this mean, brothers
and sisters? When you gather, each
person has a psalm, doctrine, revela on,
another language, or an interpreta on.
Everything must be done to help each
other grow.
27 If people speak in other languages,
only two or three at the most should
speak. They should do it one at a me,
and someone must interpret what each
person says.
28 But if an interpreter isn’t present,
those people should remain silent in1 CORINTHIANS 14
61
church. They should only speak to
themselves and to God.
29 Two or three people should speak
what God has revealed. Everyone else
should decide whether what each
person said is right or wrong.
30 If God reveals something to another
person who is seated, the ﬁrst speaker
should be silent.
31 All of you can take your turns
speaking what God has revealed. In
that way, everyone will learn and be
encouraged.
32 People who speak what God has
revealed must control themselves.
33 God is not a God of disorder but a
God of peace. As in all the churches of
God’s holy people,
34 the women must keep silent. They
don’t have the right to speak. They must
take their place as Moses’ Teachings say.1 CORINTHIANS 14 – 15
62
35 If they want to know anything they
should ask their husbands at home.
It’s shameful for a woman to speak in
church.
36 Did God’s word originate with you?
Are you the only ones it has reached?
37 Whoever thinks that he speaks for
God or that he is spiritually gi ed must
acknowledge that what I write to you is
what the Lord commands.
38 But whoever ignores what I write
should be ignored.
39 So, brothers and sisters, desire to
speak what God has revealed, and don’t
keep anyone from speaking in other
languages.
40 Everything must be done in a proper
and orderly way.
1 Brothers and sisters, I’m making
known to you the Good News
which I already told you, which you
151 CORINTHIANS 15
63
received, and on which your faith is
based.
2 In addi on, you are saved by this
Good News if you hold on to the doctrine
I taught you, unless you believed it
without thinking it over.
3 I passed on to you the most important
points of doctrine that I had received:
Christ died to take away our sins as the
Scriptures predicted.
4 He was placed in a tomb. He was
brought back to life on the third day as
the Scriptures predicted.
5 He appeared to Cephas. Next he
appeared to the twelve apostles.
6 Then he appeared to more than 500
believers at one me. (Most of these
people are s ll living, but some have
died.)
7 Next he appeared to James. Then he
appeared to all the apostles.1 CORINTHIANS 15
64
8 Last of all, he also appeared to me. I’m
like an aborted fetus who was given life.
9 I’m the least of the apostles. I’m not
even ﬁt to be called an apostle because I
persecuted God’s church.
10 But God’s kindness made me what I
am, and that kindness was not wasted
on me. Instead, I worked harder than all
the others. It was not I who did it, but
God’s kindness was with me.
11 So, whether it was I or someone else,
this is the message we brought you, and
this is what you believed.
12 If we have told you that Christ has
been brought back to life, how can some
of you say that coming back from the
dead is impossible?
13 If the dead can’t be brought back to
life, then Christ hasn’t come back to life.
14 If Christ hasn’t come back to life, our
message has no meaning and your faith
also has no meaning.1 CORINTHIANS 15
15 In addi
65
on, we are obviously
witnesses who lied about God because
we tes ﬁed that he brought Christ back
to life. But if it’s true that the dead don’t
come back to life, then God didn’t bring
Christ back to life.
16 Certainly, if the dead don’t come
back to life, then Christ hasn’t come back
to life either.
17 If Christ hasn’t come back to life,
your faith is worthless and sin s ll has
you in its power.
18 Then those who have died as
believers in Christ no longer exist.
19 If Christ is our hope in this life only,
we deserve more pity than any other
people.
20 But now Christ has come back from
the dead. He is the very ﬁrst person of
those who have died to come back to
life.1 CORINTHIANS 15
66
21 Since a man brought death, a man
also brought life back from death.
22 As everyone dies because of Adam,
so also everyone will be made alive
because of Christ.
23 This will happen to each person in his
own turn. Christ is the ﬁrst, then at his
coming, those who belong to him will be
made alive.
24 Then the end will come. Christ
will hand over the kingdom to God
the Father as he destroys every ruler,
authority, and power.
25 Christ must rule un l God has put
every enemy under his control.
26 The last enemy he will destroy is
death.
27 Clearly, God has put everything
under Christ’s authority. When God says
that everything has been put under
Christ’s authority, this clearly excludes1 CORINTHIANS 15
67
God, since God has put everything under
Christ’s authority.
28 But when God puts everything
under Christ’s authority, the Son will
put himself under God’s authority, since
God had put everything under the Son’s
authority. Then God will be in control of
everything.
29 However, people are bap zed
because the dead will come back to life.
What will they do? If the dead can’t
come back to life, why do people get
bap zed as if they can come back to life?
30 Why are we constantly pu ng
ourselves in danger?
31 Brothers and sisters, I swear to you
on my pride in you which Christ Jesus
our Lord has given me: I face death every
day.
32 If I have fought with wild animals in
Ephesus, what have I gained according
to the way people look at things? If the1 CORINTHIANS 15
68
dead are not raised, "Let’s eat and drink
because tomorrow we’re going to die!"
33 Don’t let anyone deceive you.
Associa ng with bad people will ruin
decent people.
34 Come back to the right point of view,
and stop sinning. Some people don’t
know anything about God. You should
be ashamed of yourselves.
35 But someone will ask, "How do the
dead come back to life? With what kind
of body will they come back?"
36 You fool! The seed you plant doesn’t
come to life unless it dies ﬁrst.
37 What you plant, whether it’s wheat
or something else, is only a seed. It
doesn’t have the form that the plant will
have.
38 God gives the plant the form he
wants it to have. Each kind of seed grows
into its own form.1 CORINTHIANS 15
69
39 Not all ﬂesh is the same. Humans
have one kind of ﬂesh, animals have
another, birds have another, and ﬁsh
have s ll another.
40 There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies. Heavenly bodies don’t
all have the same splendor, neither do
earthly bodies.
41 The sun has one kind of splendor,
the moon has another kind of splendor,
and the stars have s ll another kind
of splendor. Even one star diﬀers in
splendor from another star.
42 That is how it will be when the dead
come back to life. When the body is
planted, it decays. When it comes back
to life, it cannot decay.
43 When the body is planted, it doesn’t
have any splendor and is weak. When it
comes back to life, it has splendor and is
strong.1 CORINTHIANS 15
70
44 It is planted as a physical body. It
comes back to life as a spiritual body. As
there is a physical body, so there is also
a spiritual body.
45 This is what Scripture says: "The ﬁrst
man, Adam, became a living being." The
last Adam became a life–giving spirit.
46 The spiritual does not come ﬁrst, but
the physical and then the spiritual.
47 The ﬁrst man was made from the
dust of the earth. He came from the
earth. The second man came from
heaven.
48 The people on earth are like the man
who was made from the dust of the
earth. The people in heaven are like the
man who came from heaven.
49 As we have worn the likeness of the
man who was made from the dust of the
earth, we will also wear the likeness of
the man who came from heaven.1 CORINTHIANS 15
71
50 Brothers and sisters, this is what I
mean: Flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God. What decays
cannot inherit what doesn’t decay.
51 I’m telling you a mystery. Not all of us
will die, but we will all be changed.
52 It will happen in an instant, in a split
second at the sound of the last trumpet.
Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and
then the dead will come back to life.
They will be changed so that they can
live forever.
53 This body that decays must be
changed into a body that cannot decay.
This mortal body must be changed into a
body that will live forever.
54 When this body that decays is
changed into a body that cannot decay,
and this mortal body is changed into
a body that will live forever, then the
teaching of Scripture will come true:
"Death is turned into victory!1 CORINTHIANS 15 – 16
72
55 Death, where is your victory? Death,
where is your s ng?"
56 Sin gives death its s ng, and God’s
standards give sin its power.
57 Thank God that he gives us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
58 So, then, brothers and sisters, don’t
let anyone move you oﬀ the founda on
of your faith. Always excel in the work
you do for the Lord. You know that the
hard work you do for the Lord is not
pointless.
1 Now, concerning the money to
be collected for God’s people in
Jerusalem: I want you to do as I directed
the churches in Gala a.
2 Every Sunday each of you should set
aside some of your money and save it.
Then money won’t have to be collected
when I come.
3 When I come, I will give le ers
of introduc on to the people whom
161 CORINTHIANS 16
73
you choose. You can send your gi to
Jerusalem with them.
4 If I think it’s worthwhile for me to go,
they can go with me.
5 A er I go through the province of
Macedonia, I’ll visit you. (I will be going
through Macedonia.)
6 I’ll probably stay with you. I might
even spend the winter. Then you can give
me your support as I travel, wherever I
decide to go.
7 Right now all I could do is visit you
brieﬂy, but if the Lord lets me, I hope to
spend some me with you.
8 I will be staying here in Ephesus un l
Pentecost.
9 I have a great opportunity to do
eﬀec ve work here, although there are
many people who oppose me.
10 If Timothy comes, make sure that
he doesn’t have anything to be afraid1 CORINTHIANS 16
74
of while he is with you. He’s doing the
Lord’s work as I am,
11 so no one should treat him with
contempt. Without quarreling, give him
your support for his trip so that he may
come to me. I’m expec ng him to arrive
with the other Chris ans.
12 Concerning Apollos, our brother
in the Chris an faith: I tried hard to
get him to visit you with the other
Chris ans. He didn’t want to at this me.
However, he will visit you when he has
an opportunity.
13 Be alert. Be ﬁrm in the Chris an faith.
Be courageous and strong.
14 Do everything with love.
15 You know that the family of
Stephanas was the ﬁrst family to be
won for Christ in Greece. This family has
devoted itself to serving God’s people.
So I encourage you, brothers and sisters,1 CORINTHIANS 16
75
16 to follow the example of people like
these and anyone else who shares their
labor and hard work.
17 I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus,
and Achaicus came here. They have
made up for your absence.
18 They have comforted me, and they
have comforted you. Therefore, show
people like these your apprecia on.
19 The churches in the province of Asia
greet you. Aquila and Prisca and the
church that meets in their house send
their warmest Chris an gree ngs.
20 All the brothers and sisters here greet
you. Greet each other with a holy kiss.
21 I, Paul, am wri ng this gree ng with
my own hand.
22 If anyone doesn’t love the Lord, let
him be cursed! Our Lord, come!
23 May the good will of the Lord Jesus
be with you.1 CORINTHIANS 16
76
24 Through Christ Jesus my love is with
all of you.2 Corinthians
1
1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus by the will of God, and from
Timothy our brother. To God’s church in
the city of Corinth and to all God’s holy
people everywhere in Greece.
2 Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
3 Praise the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ! He is the Father who is
compassionate and the God who gives
comfort.
4 He comforts us whenever we suﬀer.
That is why whenever other people
suﬀer, we are able to comfort them
by using the same comfort we have
received from God.2 CORINTHIANS 1
2
5 Because Christ suﬀered so much for
us, we can receive so much comfort from
him.
6 Besides, if we suﬀer, it brings you
comfort and salva on. If we are
comforted, we can eﬀec vely comfort
you when you endure the same
suﬀerings that we endure.
7 We have conﬁdence in you. We know
that as you share our suﬀerings, you also
share our comfort.
8 Brothers and sisters, we don’t want
you to be ignorant about the suﬀering
we experienced in the province of Asia.
It was so extreme that it was beyond our
ability to endure. We even wondered if
we could go on living.
9 In fact, we s ll feel as if we’re under a
death sentence. But we suﬀered so that
we would stop trus ng ourselves and
learn to trust God, who brings the dead
back to life.2 CORINTHIANS 1
3
10 He has rescued us from a terrible
death, and he will rescue us in the
future. We are conﬁdent that he will
con nue to rescue us,
11 since you are also joining to help us
when you pray for us. Then many people
will thank God for the favor he will show
us because many people prayed for us.
12 We are proud that our conscience is
clear. We are proud of the way that we
have lived in this world. We have lived
with a God–given holiness and sincerity,
especially toward you. It was not by
human wisdom that we have lived but
by God’s kindness.
13 We are only wri ng you what you
already knew before you read this. I
hope you will understand this as long as
you live,
14 even though you now understand it
only par ally. We are your reason to be2 CORINTHIANS 1
4
proud, as you will be our reason to be
proud on the day of our Lord Jesus.
15 Conﬁdent of this, I had previously
wanted to visit you so that you could
beneﬁt twice.
16 My plans had been to go from the city
of Corinth to the province of Macedonia.
Then from Macedonia I had planned to
return to you again in Corinth and have
you support my trip to Judea.
17 You don’t think that I made these
plans lightly, do you? Do you think
that when I make plans, I make them
in a sinful way? Why would I say that
something is true when it isn’t?
18 You can depend on God. Our message
to you isn’t false; it’s true.
19 God’s Son, Jesus Christ, whom I,
Silvanus, and Timothy told you about,
was true not false. Because of him our
message was always true.2 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
5
20 Certainly, Christ made God’s many
promises come true. For that reason,
because of our message, people also
honor God by saying, "Amen!"
21 God establishes us, together with
you, in a rela onship with Christ. He has
also anointed us.
22 In addi on, he has put his seal of
ownership on us and has given us the
Spirit as his guarantee.
23 I appeal to God as a witness on my
behalf, that I stayed away from Corinth
because I wanted to spare you.
24 It isn’t that we want to have control
over your Chris an faith. Rather, we
want to work with you so that you
will be happy. Certainly, you are ﬁrmly
established in the Chris an faith.
1 I decided not to visit you again
while I was distressed.
2 A er all, if I had made you
uncomfortable, how could you have
22 CORINTHIANS 2
6
cheered me up when you were
uncomfortable?
3 This is the very reason I wrote to
you. I didn’t want to visit you and be
distressed by those who should make
me happy. I’m conﬁdent about all of
you that whatever makes me happy also
makes you happy.
4 I was deeply troubled and anguished.
In fact, I had tears in my eyes when I
wrote to you. I didn’t write to make you
uncomfortable but to let you know how
much I love you.
5 If someone caused distress, I’m not
the one really aﬀected. To some extent–
–although I don’t want to emphasize this
too much––it has aﬀected all of you.
6 The majority of you have imposed
a severe enough punishment on that
person.2 CORINTHIANS 2
7
7 So now forgive and comfort him. Such
distress could overwhelm someone like
that if he’s not forgiven and comforted.
8 That is why I urge you to assure him
that you love him.
9 I had also wri en to you to test you. I
wanted to see if you would be obedient
in every way.
10 If you forgive someone, so do I.
Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have
forgiven anything, I did in the presence
of Christ for your beneﬁt.
11 I don’t want Satan to outwit us. A er
all, we are not ignorant about Satan’s
scheming.
12 When I went to the city of Troas, the
Lord gave me an opportunity to spread
the Good News about Christ.
13 But I didn’t have any peace of mind,
because I couldn’t ﬁnd Titus, our brother,
there. So I said goodbye to the people2 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
8
in Troas and went to the province of
Macedonia.
14 But I thank God, who always leads us
in victory because of Christ. Wherever
we go, God uses us to make clear what
it means to know Christ. It’s like a
fragrance that ﬁlls the air.
15 To God we are the aroma of Christ
among those who are saved and among
those who are dying.
16 To some people we are a deadly
fragrance, while to others we are a
life–giving fragrance. Who is qualiﬁed to
tell about Christ?
17 At least we don’t go around selling
an impure word of God like many
others. The opposite is true. As Christ’s
spokesmen and in God’s presence, we
speak the pure message that comes
from God.
1 Do we have to show you our
qualiﬁca ons again? Do we,
32 CORINTHIANS 3
9
like some people, need le ers that
recommend us to you or le ers from
you that recommend us to others?
2 You’re our le er of recommenda on
wri en in our hearts that everyone
knows and reads.
3 It’s clear that you are Christ’s le er,
wri en as a result of our ministry. You
are a le er wri en not with ink but
with the Spirit of the living God, a le er
wri en not on tablets of stone but on
tablets of human hearts.
4 Christ gives us conﬁdence about you
in God’s presence.
5 By ourselves we are not qualiﬁed
in any way to claim that we can
do anything. Rather, God makes us
qualiﬁed.
6 He has also qualiﬁed us to be ministers
of a new promise, a spiritual promise,
not a wri en one. Clearly, what was2 CORINTHIANS 3
10
wri en brings death, but the Spirit
brings life.
7 The ministry that brought death was
inscribed on stone. Yet, it came with
such glory that the people of Israel
couldn’t look at Moses’ face. His face
was shining with glory, even though that
glory was fading.
8 Won’t the ministry that brings the
Spirit have even more glory?
9 If the ministry that brings punishment
has glory, then the ministry that brings
God’s approval has an overwhelming
glory.
10 In fact, the ministry that brings
punishment lost its glory because of the
superior glory of the other ministry.
11 If that former ministry faded away
despite its glory, how much more does
that ministry which remains con nue to
be glorious?2 CORINTHIANS 3
11
12 Since we have conﬁdence in the new
promise, we speak very boldly.
13 We are not like Moses. He kept
covering his face with a veil. He didn’t
want the people of Israel to see the glory
fading away.
14 However, their minds became closed.
In fact, to this day the same veil is s ll
there when they read the Old Testament.
It isn’t removed, because only Christ can
remove it.
15 Yet, even today, when they read
the books of Moses, a veil covers their
minds.
16 But whenever a person turns to the
Lord, the veil is taken away.
17 This Lord is the Spirit. Wherever the
Lord’s Spirit is, there is freedom.
18 As all of us reﬂect the Lord’s glory
with faces that are not covered with
veils, we are being changed into his2 CORINTHIANS 4
12
image with ever–increasing glory. This
comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
1 We don’t become discouraged,
since God has given us this ministry
through his mercy.
2 Instead, we have refused to use secret
and shameful ways. We don’t use tricks,
and we don’t distort God’s word. As
God watches, we clearly reveal the
truth to everyone. This is our le er of
recommenda on.
3 So if the Good News that we tell
others is covered with a veil, it is hidden
from those who are dying.
4 The god of this world has blinded the
minds of those who don’t believe. As
a result, they don’t see the light of the
Good News about Christ’s glory. It is
Christ who is God’s image.
5 Our message is not about ourselves. It
is about Jesus Christ as the Lord. We are
your servants for his sake.
42 CORINTHIANS 4
13
6 We are his servants because the same
God who said that light should shine out
of darkness has given us light. For that
reason we bring to light the knowledge
about God’s glory which shines from
Christ’s face.
7 Our bodies are made of clay, yet we
have the treasure of the Good News
in them. This shows that the superior
power of this treasure belongs to God
and doesn’t come from us.
8 In every way we’re troubled, but we
aren’t crushed by our troubles. We’re
frustrated, but we don’t give up.
9 We’re persecuted, but we’re not
abandoned. We’re captured, but we’re
not killed.
10 We always carry around the death
of Jesus in our bodies so that the life of
Jesus is also shown in our bodies.
11 While we are alive, we are constantly
handed over to death for Jesus’ sake so2 CORINTHIANS 4
14
that the life of Jesus is also shown in our
mortal nature.
12 Death is at work in us, but life is at
work in you.
13 The following is wri en, "I believed;
therefore, I spoke." We have that same
spirit of faith. We also believe; therefore,
we also speak.
14 We know that the one who brought
the Lord Jesus back to life will also bring
us back to life through Jesus. He will
present us to God together with you.
15 All this is for your sake so that, as
God’s kindness overﬂows in the lives of
many people, it will produce even more
thanksgiving to the glory of God.
16 That is why we are not discouraged.
Though outwardly we are wearing out,
inwardly we are renewed day by day.
17 Our suﬀering is light and temporary
and is producing for us an eternal glory2 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
15
that is greater than anything we can
imagine.
18 We don’t look for things that can
be seen but for things that can’t be
seen. Things that can be seen are only
temporary. But things that can’t be seen
last forever.
1 We know that if the life we live
here on earth is ever taken down like
a tent, we s ll have a building from God.
It is an eternal house in heaven that isn’t
made by human hands.
2 In our present tent–like existence we
sigh, since we long to put on the house
we will have in heaven.
3 A er we have put it on, we won’t be
naked.
4 While we are in this tent, we sigh. We
feel distressed because we don’t want to
take oﬀ the tent, but we do want to put
on the eternal house. Then eternal life
will put an end to our mortal existence.
52 CORINTHIANS 5
16
5 God has prepared us for this and has
given us his Spirit to guarantee it.
6 So we are always conﬁdent. We know
that as long as we are living in these
bodies, we are living away from the Lord.
7 Indeed, our lives are guided by faith,
not by sight.
8 We are conﬁdent and prefer to live
away from this body and to live with the
Lord.
9 Whether we live in the body or move
out of it, our goal is to be pleasing to
him.
10 All of us must appear in front of
Christ’s judgment seat. Then all people
will receive what they deserve for the
good or evil they have done while living
in their bodies.
11 As people who know what it means
to fear the Lord, we try to persuade
others. God already knows what we are,2 CORINTHIANS 5
17
and I hope that you also know what we
are.
12 We are not trying to show you our
qualiﬁca ons again, but we are giving
you an opportunity to be proud of us.
Then you can answer those who are
proud of their appearance rather than
their character.
13 So if we were crazy, it was for God. If
we are sane, it is for you.
14 Clearly, Christ’s love guides us. We
are convinced of the fact that one man
has died for all people. Therefore, all
people have died.
15 He died for all people so that those
who live should no longer live for
themselves but for the man who died
and was brought back to life for them.
16 So from now on we don’t think of
anyone from a human point of view. If
we did think of Christ from a human
point of view, we don’t anymore.2 CORINTHIANS 5
18
17 Whoever is a believer in Christ is a
new crea on. The old way of living has
disappeared. A new way of living has
come into existence.
18 God has done all this. He has restored
our rela onship with him through Christ,
and has given us this ministry of
restoring rela onships.
19 In other words, God was using
Christ to restore his rela onship with
humanity. He didn’t hold people’s faults
against them, and he has given us this
message of restored rela onships to tell
others.
20 Therefore, we are Christ’s
representa ves, and through us
God is calling you. We beg you on behalf
of Christ to become reunited with God.
21 God had Christ, who was sinless, take
our sin so that we might receive God’s
approval through him.2 CORINTHIANS 6
6
19
1 Since we are God’s coworkers, we
urge you not to let God’s kindness be
wasted on you.
2 God says, "At the right me I heard
you. On the day of salva on I helped
you." Listen, now is God’s acceptable
me! Now is the day of salva on!
3 We don’t give people any opportunity
to ﬁnd fault with how we serve.
4 Instead, our lives demonstrate that
we are God’s servants. We have endured
many things: suﬀering, distress, anxiety,
5 bea ngs, imprisonments, riots, hard
work, sleepless nights, and lack of food.
6 People can see our purity, knowledge,
pa ence, kindness, the Holy Spirit’s
presence in our lives, our sincere love,
7 truthfulness, and the presence of
God’s power. We demonstrate that we
are God’s servants
8 as we are praised and dishonored, as
we are slandered and honored, and as2 CORINTHIANS 6
20
we use what is right to a ack what is
wrong and to defend the truth. We are
treated as dishonest although we are
honest,
9 as unknown although we are well–
known, as dying although, as you see,
we go on living. We are punished, but
we are not killed.
10 People think we are sad although
we’re always glad, that we’re beggars
although we make many people
spiritually rich, that we have nothing
although we possess everything.
11 We have been very open in speaking
to you Corinthians. We have a place for
you in our hearts.
12 We haven’t cut you oﬀ. Your own
emo ons have cut you oﬀ from us.
13 I’m talking to you as I would talk to
children. Treat us the same way we’ve
treated you. Make a place for us in your
hearts too.2 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
21
14 Stop forming inappropriate
rela onships with unbelievers. Can right
and wrong be partners? Can light have
anything in common with darkness?
15 Can Christ agree with the devil? Can
a believer share life with an unbeliever?
16 Can God’s temple contain false gods?
Clearly, we are the temple of the living
God. As God said, "I will live and walk
among them. I will be their God, and
they will be my people."
17 The Lord says, "Get away from
unbelievers. Separate yourselves from
them. Have nothing to do with anything
unclean. Then I will welcome you."
18 The Lord Almighty says, "I will be
your Father, and you will be my sons and
daughters."
1 Since we have these promises, dear
friends, we need to cleanse ourselves
from everything that contaminates body
72 CORINTHIANS 7
22
and spirit and live a holy life in the fear
of God.
2 Open your hearts to us. We haven’t
treated anyone unjustly, ruined anyone,
or cheated anyone.
3 I’m not saying this to condemn you.
I’ve already told you that you are in
our hearts so that we will live and die
together.
4 I have great conﬁdence in you, and I
have a lot of reasons to be proud of you.
Even as we suﬀer, I’m encouraged and
feel very happy.
5 Ever since we arrived in the province
of Macedonia, we’ve had no rest.
Instead, we suﬀer in a number of
ways. Outwardly we have conﬂicts, and
inwardly we have fears.
6 Yet God, who comforts those who
are dejected, comforted us when Titus
arrived.2 CORINTHIANS 7
23
7 We were comforted not only by his
arrival but also by learning about the
comfort he had received while he was
with you. He told us how you wanted
to see me, how sorry you are for what
you’ve done, and how concerned you
are about me. This made me even
happier.
8 If my le er made you uncomfortable,
I’m not sorry. But since my le er did
make you uncomfortable for a while, I
was sorry.
9 But I’m happy now, not because I
made you uncomfortable, but because
the distress I caused you has led you to
change the way you think and act. You
were distressed in a godly way, so we
haven’t done you any harm.
10 In fact, to be distressed in a godly
way causes people to change the way
they think and act and leads them to
be saved. No one can regret that. But2 CORINTHIANS 7
24
the distress that the world causes brings
only death.
11 When you became distressed in a
godly way, look at how much devo on it
caused you to have. You were ready to
clear yourselves of the charges against
you. You were disgusted with the wrong
that had been done. You were afraid. You
wanted to see us. You wanted to show
your concern for us. You were ready to
punish the wrong that had been done. In
every way you have demonstrated that
you are people who are innocent in this
ma er.
12 So, when I wrote to you, I didn’t write
because of the man who did the wrong
or the man who was hurt by it. Rather,
I wrote because I wanted you to show
your devo on to us in God’s sight.
13 This is what has comforted us. In
addi on to being comforted, we were
especially pleased to see how happy2 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
25
Titus was. All of you had put his mind at
ease.
14 I didn’t have to be ashamed of
anything I had said to him when I
bragged about you. Since everything we
told you was true, our bragging to Titus
has also proved to be true.
15 His deepest feelings go out to you
even more as he remembers how
obedient all of you were, and how you
welcomed him with fear and trembling.
16 I’m pleased that I can be conﬁdent
about you in every way.
1 Brothers and sisters, we want
you to know how God showed his
kindness to the churches in the province
of Macedonia.
2 While they were being severely tested
by suﬀering, their overﬂowing joy, along
with their extreme poverty, has made
them even more generous.
82 CORINTHIANS 8
26
3 I assure you that by their own free
will they have given all they could, even
more than they could aﬀord.
4 They made an appeal to us, begging
us to let them par cipate in the ministry
of God’s kindness to his holy people in
Jerusalem.
5 They did more than we had expected.
First, they gave themselves to the Lord
and to us, since this was God’s will.
6 This led us to urge Titus to ﬁnish his
work of God’s kindness among you in
the same way as he had already started
it.
7 Indeed, the more your faith, your
ability to speak, your knowledge, your
dedica on, and your love for us increase,
the more we want you to par cipate in
this work of God’s kindness.
8 I’m not commanding you, but I’m
tes ng how genuine your love is by
poin ng out the dedica on of others.2 CORINTHIANS 8
27
9 You know about the kindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ. He was rich, yet for
your sake he became poor in order to
make you rich through his poverty.
10 I’m giving you my opinion because it
will be helpful to you. Last year you were
not only willing to take a collec on but
had already started to do it.
11 So ﬁnish what you began to do. Then
your willingness will be matched by what
you accomplish
12 with whatever contribu ons you
have. Since you are willing to do this,
remember that people are accepted if
they give what they are able to give. God
doesn’t ask for what they don’t have.
13 I don’t mean that others should have
relief while you have hardship. Rather,
it’s a ma er of striking a balance.
14 At the present me, your surplus ﬁlls
their need so that their surplus may ﬁll2 CORINTHIANS 8
28
your need. In this way things balance
out.
15 This is what Scripture says: "Those
who had gathered a lot didn’t have too
much, and those who gathered a li le
didn’t have too li le."
16 I thank God for making Titus as
dedicated to you as I am.
17 He accepted my request and eagerly
went to visit you by his own free will.
18 With him we have sent our Chris an
brother whom all the churches praise for
the way he tells the Good News.
19 More than that, the churches elected
him to travel with us and bring this gi
of God’s kindness. We are administering
it in a way that brings glory to the Lord
and shows that we are doing it willingly.
20 We don’t want anyone to ﬁnd fault
with the way we are administering this
generous gi .2 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
29
21 We intend to do what is right, not
only in the sight of the Lord, but also in
the sight of people.
22 We have also sent with them our
Chris an brother whom we have o en
tested in many ways and found to be
a dedicated worker. We ﬁnd that he is
much more dedicated now than ever
because he has so much conﬁdence in
you.
23 If any ques ons are raised, remember
that Titus is my partner and coworker
to help you. The other men are
representa ves of the churches and
bring glory to Christ.
24 So give these men a demonstra on
of your love. Show their congrega ons
that we were right to be proud of you.
1 I don’t need to write anything
further to you about helping the
Chris ans in Jerusalem.
92 CORINTHIANS 9
30
2 I know how willing you are to help,
and I brag about you to the believers in
the province of Macedonia. I tell them,
"The people of Greece have been ready
to send their collec on since last year,"
and your enthusiasm has moved most of
them to act.
3 I’ve sent my coworkers so that when
we brag that you’re ready, we can back
it up.
4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come
with me, they might ﬁnd out that you’re
not ready a er all. This would embarrass
us for feeling so conﬁdent as much as it
would embarrass you.
5 So I thought that I should encourage
our coworkers to visit you before I do
and make arrangements for this gi that
you had already promised to give. Then
it will be the blessing it was intended to
be, and it won’t be something you’re
forced to do.2 CORINTHIANS 9
31
6 Remember this: The farmer who
plants a few seeds will have a very small
harvest. But the farmer who plants
because he has received God’s blessings
will receive a harvest of God’s blessings
in return.
7 Each of you should give whatever you
have decided. You shouldn’t be sorry
that you gave or feel forced to give, since
God loves a cheerful giver.
8 Besides, God will give you his
constantly overﬂowing kindness. Then,
when you always have everything you
need, you can do more and more good
things.
9 Scripture says, "The righteous
person gives freely to the poor. His
righteousness con nues forever."
10 God gives seed to the farmer and
food to those who need to eat. God will
also give you seed and mul ply it. In2 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
32
your lives he will increase the things you
do that have his approval.
11 God will make you rich enough so
that you can always be generous. Your
generosity will produce thanksgiving to
God because of us.
12 What you do to serve others not
only provides for the needs of God’s
people, but also produces more and
more prayers of thanksgiving to God.
13 You will honor God through this
genuine act of service because of your
commitment to spread the Good News
of Christ and because of your generosity
in sharing with them and everyone else.
14 With deep aﬀec on they will pray for
you because of the extreme kindness
that God has shown you.
15 I thank God for his gi that words
cannot describe.
1 I, Paul, make my appeal to you
with the gentleness and kindness
102 CORINTHIANS 10
33
of Christ. I’m the one who is humble
when I’m with you but forceful toward
you when I’m not with you.
2 I beg you that when I am with you I
won’t have to deal forcefully with you.
I expect I will have to because some
people think that we are only guided by
human mo ves.
3 Of course we are human, but we don’t
ﬁght like humans.
4 The weapons we use in our ﬁght are
not made by humans. Rather, they are
powerful weapons from God. With them
we destroy people’s defenses, that is,
their arguments
5 and all their intellectual arrogance
that oppose the knowledge of God. We
take every thought cap ve so that it is
obedient to Christ.
6 We are ready to punish every act of
disobedience when you have become
completely obedient.2 CORINTHIANS 10
34
7 Look at the plain facts! If anyone is
conﬁdent he belongs to Christ, he should
take note that we also belong to Christ.
8 So, if I brag a li le too much about
the authority which the Lord gave us,
I’m not ashamed. The Lord gave us this
authority to help you, not to hurt you.
9 I don’t want you to think that I’m
trying to frighten you with my le ers.
10 I know that someone is saying that
my le ers are powerful and strong,
but that I’m a weakling and a terrible
speaker.
11 The person who is saying those things
should take note of this fact: When we
are with you we will do the things that
we wrote about in our le ers when we
weren’t with you.
12 We wouldn’t put ourselves in the
same class with or compare ourselves
to those who are bold enough to make
their own recommenda ons. Certainly,2 CORINTHIANS 10
35
when they measure themselves by
themselves and compare themselves to
themselves, they show how foolish they
are.
13 How can we brag about things that
no one can evaluate? Instead, we will
only brag about what God has given us
to do––coming to the city of Corinth
where you live.
14 It’s not as though we hadn’t already
been to Corinth. We’re not oversta ng
the facts. The fact is that we were the
ﬁrst to arrive in Corinth with the Good
News about Christ.
15 How can we brag about things done
by others that can’t be evaluated?
We have conﬁdence that as your faith
grows, you will think enough of us to
give us the help we need to carry out
our assignment––
16 spreading the Good News in the
regions far beyond you. We won’t brag2 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
36
about things already accomplished by
someone else.
17 "Whoever brags should brag about
what the Lord has done."
18 It isn’t the person who makes his
own recommenda on who receives
approval, but the person whom the Lord
recommends.
1 I want you to put up with a li le
foolishness from me. I’m sure
that you will.
2 I’m as protec ve of you as God is.
A er all, you’re a virgin whom I promised
in marriage to one man––Christ.
3 However, I’m afraid that as the snake
deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds
may somehow be lured away from your
sincere and pure devo on to Christ.
4 When someone comes to you telling
about another Jesus whom we didn’t
tell you about, you’re willing to put up
with it. When you receive a spirit that
112 CORINTHIANS 11
37
is diﬀerent from the Spirit you received
earlier, you’re also willing to put up with
that. When someone tells you good
news that is diﬀerent from the Good
News you already accepted, you’re
willing to put up with that too.
5 I don’t think I’m inferior in any way to
your super–apostles.
6 Even though I’m not good with words,
I know what I’m talking about. Timothy
and I have made this clear to you in
every possible way.
7 Did I commit a sin when I humbled
myself by telling you the Good News of
God free of charge so that you could
become important?
8 I robbed other churches by taking pay
from them to serve you.
9 When I was with you and needed
something, I didn’t bother any of you
for help. My friends from the province
of Macedonia supplied everything I2 CORINTHIANS 11
38
needed. I kept myself from being a
ﬁnancial burden to you in any way, and I
will con nue to do that.
10 As surely as I have Christ’s truth, my
bragging will not be silenced anywhere
in Greece.
11 Why? Because I don’t love you? God
knows that I do love you.
12 But I’ll go on doing what I’m doing.
This will take away the opportunity of
those people who want to brag because
they think they’re like us.
13 People who brag like this are false
apostles. They are dishonest workers,
since they disguise themselves as Christ’s
apostles.
14 And no wonder, even Satan disguises
himself as an angel of light.
15 So it’s not surprising if his servants
also disguise themselves as servants
who have God’s approval. In the end
they will get what they deserve.2 CORINTHIANS 11
39
16 Again I say that no one should think
that I’m a fool. But if you do, then take
me for a fool so that I can also brag a
li le.
17 What I say as I start bragging is
foolishness. It’s not something I would
say if I were speaking for the Lord.
18 Since it’s common for people to brag,
I’ll do it too.
19 You’re wise, so you’ll gladly put up
with fools.
20 When someone makes you slaves,
consumes your wealth, seizes your
property, orders you around, or slaps
your faces, you put up with it.
21 I’m ashamed to admit it, but Timothy
and I don’t have the strength to do those
things to you. Whatever other people
dare to brag about, I, like a fool, can also
brag about.2 CORINTHIANS 11
40
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they
Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s
descendants? So am I.
23 Are they Christ’s servants? It’s insane
to say it, but I’m a far be er one. I’ve
done much more work, been in prison
many more mes, been beaten more
severely, and have faced death more
o en.
24 Five mes the Jewish leaders had me
beaten with 39 lashes;
25 three mes Roman oﬃcials had me
beaten with clubs. Once people tried to
stone me to death; three mes I was
shipwrecked, and I dri ed on the sea for
a night and a day.
26 Because I’ve traveled a lot, I’ve faced
dangers from raging rivers, from robbers,
from my own people, and from other
people. I’ve faced dangers in the city, in
the open country, on the sea, and from2 CORINTHIANS 11
41
believers who turned out to be false
friends.
27 Because I’ve had to work so hard,
I’ve o en gone without sleep, been
hungry and thirsty, and gone without
food and without proper clothes during
cold weather.
28 Besides these external ma ers, I
have the daily pressure of my anxiety
about all the churches.
29 When anyone is weak, I’m weak too.
When anyone is caught in a trap, I’m also
harmed.
30 If I must brag, I will brag about the
things that show how weak I am.
31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus,
who is praised forever, knows that I’m
not lying.
32 The governor under King Aretas put
guards around the city of Damascus to
catch me.2 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
42
33 So I was let down in a basket through
an opening in the wall and escaped from
him.
1 I must brag, although it doesn’t
do any good. I’ll go on to visions
and revela ons from the Lord.
2 I know a follower of Christ who was
snatched away to the third heaven
fourteen years ago. I don’t know
whether this happened to him physically
or spiritually. Only God knows.
3 I know that this person
4 was snatched away to paradise where
he heard things that can’t be expressed
in words, things that humans cannot put
into words. I don’t know whether this
happened to him physically or spiritually.
Only God knows.
5 I’ll brag about this person, but I won’t
brag about myself unless it’s about my
weaknesses.
122 CORINTHIANS 12
43
6 If I ever wanted to brag, I wouldn’t
be a fool. Instead, I would be telling the
truth. But I’m going to spare you so that
no one may think more of me than what
he sees or hears about me,
7 especially because of the excessive
number of revela ons that I’ve had.
Therefore, to keep me from becoming
conceited, I am forced to deal with
a recurring problem. That problem,
Satan’s messenger, torments me to keep
me from being conceited.
8 I begged the Lord three mes to take
it away from me.
9 But he told me: "My kindness is all
you need. My power is strongest when
you are weak." So I will brag even more
about my weaknesses in order that
Christ’s power will live in me.
10 Therefore, I accept weakness,
mistreatment, hardship, persecu on,2 CORINTHIANS 12
44
and diﬃcul es suﬀered for Christ. It’s
clear that when I’m weak, I’m strong.
11 I have become a fool. You forced
me to be one. You should have
recommended me to others. Even if I’m
nothing, I wasn’t inferior in any way to
your super–apostles.
12 While I was among you I pa ently did
the signs, wonders, and miracles which
prove that I’m an apostle.
13 How were you treated worse than
the other churches, except that I didn’t
bother you for help? Forgive me for this
wrong!
14 I’m ready to visit you for a third me,
and I won’t bother you for help. I don’t
want your possessions. Instead, I want
you. Children shouldn’t have to provide
for their parents, but parents should
provide for their children.
15 I will be very glad to spend whatever
I have. I’ll even give myself for you. Do2 CORINTHIANS 12
45
you love me less because I love you so
much?
16 You agree, then, that I haven’t been
a burden to you. Was I a clever person
who trapped you by some trick?
17 Did I take advantage of you through
any of the men I sent you?
18 I encouraged Titus to visit you, and I
sent my friend with him. Did Titus take
advantage of you? Didn’t we have the
same mo ves and do things the same
way?
19 Have you been thinking all along that
we’re trying to defend ourselves to you?
We speak as Christ’s people in God’s
sight. Everything we do, dear friends, is
for your beneﬁt.
20 I’m afraid that I may come and ﬁnd
you diﬀerent from what I want you to
be, and that you may ﬁnd me diﬀerent
from what you want me to be. I’m
afraid that there may be rivalry, jealousy,2 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
46
hot tempers, selﬁsh ambi on, slander,
gossip, arrogance, and disorderly
conduct.
21 I’m afraid that when I come to you
again, my God may humble me. I may
have to grieve over many who formerly
led sinful lives and have not changed
the way they think and act about the
perversion, sexual sins, and promiscuity
in which they have been involved.
1 This is the third me that I’ll
be visi ng you. Every accusa on
must be veriﬁed by two or three
witnesses.
2 I already warned you when I was with
you the second me, and even though
I’m not there now, I’m warning you
again. When I visit you again, I won’t
spare you. That goes for all those who
formerly led sinful lives as well as for all
the others.
132 CORINTHIANS 13
47
3 Since you want proof that Christ is
speaking through me, that’s what you’ll
get. Christ isn’t weak in dealing with you.
Instead, he makes his power felt among
you.
4 He was weak when he was cruciﬁed,
but by God’s power he lives. We are
weak with him, but by God’s power we
will live for you with his help.
5 Examine yourselves to see whether
you are s ll in the Chris an faith. Test
yourselves! Don’t you recognize that you
are people in whom Jesus Christ lives?
Could it be that you’re failing the test?
6 I hope that you will realize that we
haven’t failed the test.
7 We pray to God that you won’t do
anything wrong. It’s not that we want to
prove that we’ve passed the test. Rather,
we want you to do whatever is right,
even if we seem to have failed.2 CORINTHIANS 13
48
8 We can’t do anything against the truth
but only to help the truth.
9 We’re glad when we are weak and
you are strong. We are also praying for
your improvement.
10 That’s why I’m wri ng this le er
while I’m not with you. When I am with
you I don’t want to be harsh by using
the authority that the Lord gave me. The
Lord gave us this authority to help you,
not to hurt you.
11 With that, brothers and sisters, I
must say goodbye. Make sure that you
improve. Accept my encouragement.
Share the same a tude and live in
peace. The God of love and peace will be
with you.
12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
13 All of God’s holy people greet you.
14 May the Lord Jesus Christ’s good
will, God’s love, and the Holy Spirit’s
presence be with all of you!Gala ans
1
1 From Paul––an apostle chosen not
by any group or individual but by
Jesus Christ and God the Father who
brought him back to life––
2 and all the believers who are with me.
To the churches in Gala a.
3 Good will and peace from God the
Father and our Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
4 In order to free us from this present
evil world, Christ took the punishment
for our sins, because that was what our
God and Father wanted.
5 Glory belongs to our God and Father
forever! Amen.
6 I’m surprised that you’re so quickly
deser ng Christ, who called you in hisGALATIANS 1
2
kindness, to follow a diﬀerent kind of
good news.
7 But what some people are calling
good news is not really good news at all.
They are confusing you. They want to
distort the Good News about Christ.
8 Whoever tells you good news that
is diﬀerent from the Good News we
gave you should be condemned to hell,
even if he is one of us or an angel from
heaven.
9 I’m now telling you again what we’ve
told you in the past: If anyone tells you
good news that is diﬀerent from the
Good News you received, that person
should be condemned to hell.
10 Am I saying this now to win the
approval of people or God? Am I trying
to please people? If I were s ll trying to
please people, I would not be Christ’s
servant.GALATIANS 1
3
11 I want you to know, brothers and
sisters, that the Good News I have
spread is not a human message.
12 I didn’t receive it from any person.
I wasn’t taught it, but Jesus Christ
revealed it to me.
13 You heard about the way I once lived
when I followed the Jewish religion. You
heard how I violently persecuted God’s
church and tried to destroy it.
14 You also heard how I was far ahead of
other Jews in my age group in following
the Jewish religion. I had become
that fana cal for the tradi ons of my
ancestors.
15 But God, who appointed me before
I was born and who called me by his
kindness, was pleased
16 to show me his Son. He did this so
that I would tell people who are not
Jewish that his Son is the Good News.GALATIANS 1
4
When this happened, I didn’t talk it over
with any other person.
17 I didn’t even go to Jerusalem to see
those who were apostles before I was.
Instead, I went to Arabia and then came
back to Damascus.
18 Then, three years later I went
to Jerusalem to become personally
acquainted with Cephas. I stayed with
him for ﬁ een days.
19 I didn’t see any other apostle. I only
saw James, the Lord’s brother.
20 (God is my witness that what I’m
wri ng is not a lie.)
21 Then I went to the regions of Syria
and Cilicia.
22 The churches of Christ in Judea didn’t
know me personally.
23 The only thing they had heard was
this: "The man who persecuted us is now
spreading the faith that he once tried to
destroy."GALATIANS 1 – 2
5
24 So they praised God for what had
happened to me.
1 Then 14 years later I went to
Jerusalem again with Barnabas. I
also took Titus along.
2 I went in response to a revela on from
God. I showed them the way I spread
the Good News among people who are
not Jewish. I did this in a private mee ng
with those recognized as important
people to see whether all my eﬀorts had
been wasted.
3 Titus was with me, and although
he is Greek, no one forced him to be
circumcised.
4 False Chris ans were brought in. They
slipped in as spies to learn about the
freedom Christ Jesus gives us. They
hoped to ﬁnd a way to control us.
5 But we did not give in to them for a
moment, so that the truth of the Good
News would always be yours.
2GALATIANS 2
6
6 Those who were recognized as
important people didn’t add a single
thing to my message. (What sort of
people they were makes no diﬀerence
to me, since God doesn’t play favorites.)
7 In fact, they saw that I had been
entrusted with telling the Good News to
people who are not circumcised as Peter
had been entrusted to tell it to those
who are circumcised.
8 The one who made Peter an apostle to
Jewish people also made me an apostle
to people who are not Jewish.
9 James, Cephas, and John (who were
recognized as the most important
people) acknowledged that God had
given me this special gi . So they shook
hands with Barnabas and me, agreeing
to be our partners. It was understood
that we would work among the people
who are not Jewish and they would work
among Jewish people.GALATIANS 2
7
10 The only thing they asked us to do
was to remember the poor, the very
thing which I was eager to do.
11 When Cephas came to An och, I had
to openly oppose him because he was
completely wrong.
12 He ate with people who were not
Jewish un l some men James had sent
from Jerusalem arrived. Then Cephas
drew back and would not associate
with people who were not Jewish. He
was afraid of those who insisted that
circumcision was necessary.
13 The other Jewish Chris ans also
joined him in this hypocrisy. Even
Barnabas was swept along with them.
14 But I saw that they were not properly
following the truth of the Good News.
So I told Cephas in front of everyone,
"You’re Jewish, but you live like a person
who is not Jewish. So how can you insistGALATIANS 2
8
that people who are not Jewish must live
like Jews?"
15 We are Jewish by birth, not sinners
from other na ons.
16 Yet, we know that people don’t
receive God’s approval because of their
own eﬀorts to live according to a set
of standards, but only by believing in
Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus
Christ in order to receive God’s approval
by faith in Christ and not because of our
own eﬀorts. People won’t receive God’s
approval because of their own eﬀorts to
live according to a set of standards.
17 If we, the same people who are
searching for God’s approval in Christ,
are s ll sinners, does that mean that
Christ encourages us to sin? That’s
unthinkable!
18 If I rebuild something that I’ve torn
down, I admit that I was wrong to tear it
down.GALATIANS 2 – 3
9
19 When I tried to obey the law’s
standards, those laws killed me. As a
result, I live in a rela onship with God. I
have been cruciﬁed with Christ.
20 I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.
The life I now live I live by believing in
God’s Son, who loved me and took the
punishment for my sins.
21 I don’t reject God’s kindness. If we
receive God’s approval by obeying laws,
then Christ’s death was pointless.
1 You stupid people of Gala a! Who
put you under an evil spell? Wasn’t
Christ Jesus’ cruciﬁxion clearly described
to you?
2 I want to learn only one thing from
you. Did you receive the Spirit by your
own eﬀorts to live according to a set
of standards or by believing what you
heard?
3GALATIANS 3
10
3 Are you that stupid? Did you begin
in a spiritual way only to end up doing
things in a human way?
4 Did you suﬀer so much for nothing? I
doubt that it was for nothing!
5 Does God supply you with the Spirit
and work miracles among you through
your own eﬀorts or through believing
what you heard?
6 Abraham serves as an example.
He believed God, and that faith was
regarded by God to be his approval of
Abraham.
7 You must understand that people who
have faith are Abraham’s descendants.
8 Scripture saw ahead of me that God
would give his approval to non–Jewish
people who have faith. So Scripture
announced the Good News to Abraham
ahead of me when it said, "Through
you all the people of the world will be
blessed."GALATIANS 3
11
9 So people who believe are blessed
together with Abraham, the man of
faith.
10 Certainly, there is a curse on all who
rely on their own eﬀorts to live according
to a set of standards because Scripture
says, "Whoever doesn’t obey everything
that is wri en in Moses’ Teachings is
cursed."
11 No one receives God’s approval by
obeying the law’s standards since, "The
person who has God’s approval will live
by faith."
12 Laws have nothing to do with faith,
but, "Whoever obeys laws will live
because of the laws he obeys."
13 Christ paid the price to free us from
the curse that God’s laws bring by
becoming cursed instead of us. Scripture
says, "Everyone who is hung on a tree is
cursed."GALATIANS 3
12
14 Christ paid the price so that the
blessing promised to Abraham would
come to all the people of the world
through Jesus Christ and we would
receive the promised Spirit through
faith.
15 Brothers and sisters, let me use an
example from everyday life. No one can
cancel a person’s will or add condi ons
to it once that will is put into eﬀect.
16 The promises were spoken to
Abraham and to his descendant.
Scripture doesn’t say, "descendants,"
referring to many, but "your
descendant," referring to one.
That descendant is Christ.
17 This is what I mean: The laws given to
Moses 430 years a er God had already
put his promise to Abraham into eﬀect
didn’t cancel the promise to Abraham.
18 If we have to gain the inheritance
by following those laws, then it noGALATIANS 3
13
longer comes to us because of the
promise. However, God freely gave
the inheritance to Abraham through a
promise.
19 What, then, is the purpose of the
laws given to Moses? They were added
to iden fy what wrongdoing is. Moses’
laws did this un l the descendant to
whom the promise was given came. It
was put into eﬀect through angels, using
a mediator.
20 A mediator is not used when there is
only one person involved, and God has
acted on his own.
21 Does this mean, then, that the
laws given to Moses contradict God’s
promises? That’s unthinkable! If those
laws could give us life, then certainly we
would receive God’s approval because
we obeyed them.
22 But Scripture states that the whole
world is controlled by the power of sin.GALATIANS 3
14
Therefore, a promise based on faith in
Jesus Christ could be given to those who
believe.
23 We were kept under control by
Moses’ laws un l this faith came. We
were under their control un l this faith
which was about to come would be
revealed.
24 Before Christ came, Moses’ laws
served as our guardian. Christ came so
that we could receive God’s approval by
faith.
25 But now that this faith has come,
we are no longer under the control of a
guardian.
26 You are all God’s children by believing
in Christ Jesus.
27 Clearly, all of you who were bap zed
in Christ’s name have clothed yourselves
with Christ.
28 There are neither Jews nor Greeks,
slaves nor free people, males norGALATIANS 3 – 4
15
females. You are all the same in Christ
Jesus.
29 If you belong to Christ, then you are
Abraham’s descendants and heirs, as
God promised.
1 Let me explain further. As long as
an heir is a child, he is no be er
oﬀ than a slave, even though he owns
everything.
2 He is placed under the control of
guardians and trustees un l the me set
by his father.
3 It was the same way with us. When
we were children, we were slaves to the
principles of this world.
4 But when the right me came, God
sent his Son into the world. A woman
gave birth to him, and he came under
the control of God’s laws.
5 God sent him to pay for the freedom
of those who were controlled by these
4GALATIANS 4
16
laws so that we would be adopted as his
children.
6 Because you are God’s children, God
has sent the Spirit of his Son into us to
call out, "Abba! Father!"
7 So you are no longer slaves but God’s
children. Since you are God’s children,
God has also made you heirs.
8 When you didn’t know God, you were
slaves to things which are really not gods
at all.
9 But now you know God, or rather, God
knows you. So how can you turn back
again to the powerless and bankrupt
principles of this world? Why do you
want to become their slaves all over
again?
10 You religiously observe days, months,
seasons, and years!
11 I’m afraid for you. Maybe the hard
work I spent on you has been wasted.GALATIANS 4
17
12 Brothers and sisters, I beg you to
become like me. A er all, I became like
you were. You didn’t do anything wrong
to me.
13 You know that the ﬁrst me I brought
you the Good News I was ill.
14 Even though my illness was diﬃcult
for you, you didn’t despise or reject me.
Instead, you welcomed me as if I were
God’s messenger or Christ Jesus himself.
15 What happened to your posi ve
a tude? It’s a fact that if it had been
possible, you would have torn out your
eyes and given them to me.
16 Can it be that I have become your
enemy for telling you the truth?
17 These people who distort the Good
News are devoted to you, but not in
a good way. They don’t want you to
associate with me so that you will be
devoted only to them.GALATIANS 4
18 (Devo
18
on to a good cause is always
good, even when I’m not with you.)
19 My children, I am suﬀering birth
pains for you again un l Christ is formed
in you.
20 I wish I were with you right now so
that I could change the tone of my voice.
I’m completely puzzled by what you’ve
done!
21 Those who want to be controlled by
Moses’ laws should tell me something.
Are you really listening to what Moses’
Teachings say?
22 Scripture says that Abraham had two
sons, one by a woman who was a slave
and the other by a free woman.
23 Now, the son of the slave woman
was conceived in a natural way, but the
son of the free woman was conceived
through a promise made to Abraham.
24 I’m going to use these historical
events as an illustra on. The womenGALATIANS 4
19
illustrate two arrangements. The one
woman, Hagar, is the arrangement made
on Mount Sinai. Her children are born
into slavery.
25 Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She
is like Jerusalem today because she and
her children are slaves.
26 But the Jerusalem that is above is
free, and she is our mother.
27 Scripture says: "Rejoice, women
who cannot get pregnant, who cannot
give birth to any children! Break into
shou ng, those who feel no pains of
childbirth! Because the deserted woman
will have more children than the woman
who has a husband."
28 Now you, brothers and sisters, are
children of the promise like Isaac.
29 Furthermore, at that me the son
who was conceived in a natural way
persecuted the son conceived in aGALATIANS 4 – 5
20
spiritual way. That’s exactly what’s
happening now.
30 But what does Scripture say? "Get
rid of the slave woman and her son,
because the son of the slave woman
must never share the inheritance with
the son of the free woman."
31 Brothers and sisters, we are not
children of a slave woman but of the
free woman.
1 Christ has freed us so that we
may enjoy the beneﬁts of freedom.
Therefore, be ﬁrm in this freedom, and
don’t become slaves again.
2 I, Paul, can guarantee that if you allow
yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will
be of no beneﬁt to you.
3 Again, I insist that everyone who
allows himself to be circumcised must
realize that he obligates himself to do
everything Moses’ Teachings demand.
5GALATIANS 5
21
4 Those of you who try to earn God’s
approval by obeying his laws have been
cut oﬀ from Christ. You have fallen out
of God’s favor.
5 However, in our spiritual nature,
faith causes us to wait eagerly for the
conﬁdence that comes with God’s
approval.
6 As far as our rela onship to Christ
Jesus is concerned, it doesn’t ma er
whether we are circumcised or not. But
what ma ers is a faith that expresses
itself through love.
7 You were doing so well. Who stopped
you from being inﬂuenced by the truth?
8 The arguments of the person who is
inﬂuencing you do not come from the
one who is calling you.
9 A li le yeast spreads through the
whole batch of dough.
10 The Lord gives me conﬁdence that
you will not disagree with this. However,GALATIANS 5
22
the one who is confusing you will suﬀer
God’s judgment regardless of who he is.
11 Brothers and sisters, if I am s ll
preaching that circumcision is necessary,
why am I s ll being persecuted? In that
case the cross wouldn’t be oﬀensive
anymore.
12 I wish those troublemakers would
castrate themselves.
13 You were indeed called to be free,
brothers and sisters. Don’t turn this
freedom into an excuse for your corrupt
nature to express itself. Rather, serve
each other through love.
14 All of Moses’ Teachings are
summarized in a single statement, "Love
your neighbor as you love yourself."
15 But if you cri cize and a ack each
other, be careful that you don’t destroy
each other.
16 Let me explain further. Live your life
as your spiritual nature directs you. ThenGALATIANS 5
23
you will never follow through on what
your corrupt nature wants.
17 What your corrupt nature wants is
contrary to what your spiritual nature
wants, and what your spiritual nature
wants is contrary to what your corrupt
nature wants. They are opposed to each
other. As a result, you don’t always do
what you intend to do.
18 If your spiritual nature is your guide,
you are not subject to Moses’ laws.
19 Now, the eﬀects of the corrupt
nature are obvious: illicit sex, perversion,
promiscuity,
20 idolatry, drug use, hatred, rivalry,
jealousy, angry outbursts, selﬁsh
ambi on, conﬂict, fac ons,
21 envy, drunkenness, wild partying,
and similar things. I’ve told you in the
past and I’m telling you again that people
who do these kinds of things will not
inherit the kingdom of God.GALATIANS 5 – 6
24
22 But the spiritual nature produces
love, joy, peace, pa ence, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness,
23 gentleness, and self–control. There
are no laws against things like that.
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus
have cruciﬁed their corrupt nature along
with its passions and desires.
25 If we live by our spiritual nature, then
our lives need to conform to our spiritual
nature.
26 We can’t allow ourselves to act
arrogantly and to provoke or envy each
other.
1 Brothers and sisters, if a person
gets trapped by wrongdoing, those
of you who are spiritual should help that
person turn away from doing wrong.
Do it in a gentle way. At the same me
watch yourself so that you also are not
tempted.
6GALATIANS 6
25
2 Help carry each other’s burdens.
In this way you will follow Christ’s
teachings.
3 So if any one of you thinks you’re
important when you’re really not, you’re
only fooling yourself.
4 Each of you must examine your own
ac ons. Then you can be proud of
your own accomplishments without
comparing yourself to others.
5 Assume your own responsibility.
6 The person who is taught God’s word
should share all good things with his
teacher.
7 Make no mistake about this: You can
never make a fool out of God. Whatever
you plant is what you’ll harvest.
8 If you plant in the soil of your corrupt
nature, you will harvest destruc on. But
if you plant in the soil of your spiritual
nature, you will harvest everlas ng life.GALATIANS 6
9 We can’t allow ourselves to get
26
red
of living the right way. Certainly, each
of us will receive everlas ng life at the
proper me, if we don’t give up.
10 Whenever we have the opportunity,
we have to do what is good for everyone,
especially for the family of believers.
11 Look at how large the le ers in
these words are because I’m wri ng this
myself.
12 These people who want to make a
big deal out of a physical thing are trying
to force you to be circumcised. Their
only aim is to avoid persecu on because
of the cross of Christ.
13 It’s clear that not even those who
had themselves circumcised did this to
follow Jewish laws. Yet, they want you
to be circumcised so that they can brag
about what was done to your body.
14 But it’s unthinkable that I could ever
brag about anything except the crossGALATIANS 6
27
of our Lord Jesus Christ. By his cross
my rela onship to the world and its
rela onship to me have been cruciﬁed.
15 Certainly, it doesn’t ma er whether
a person is circumcised or not. Rather,
what ma ers is being a new crea on.
16 Peace and mercy will come to rest on
all those who conform to this principle.
They are the Israel of God.
17 From now on, don’t make any trouble
for me! A er all, I carry the scars of Jesus
on my body.
18 May the good will of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit, brothers and
sisters! Amen.Ephesians
1
1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus by God’s will. To God’s holy
and faithful people who are united with
Christ in the city of Ephesus.
2 Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
3 Praise the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ! Through Christ, God has
blessed us with every spiritual blessing
that heaven has to oﬀer.
4 Before the crea on of the world, he
chose us through Christ to be holy and
perfect in his presence.
5 Because of his love he had already
decided to adopt us through Jesus Christ.
He freely chose to do thisEPHESIANS 1
2
6 so that the kindness he had given us
in his dear Son would be praised and
given glory.
7 Through the blood of his Son, we
are set free from our sins. God forgives
our failures because of his overﬂowing
kindness.
8 He poured out his kindness by giving
us every kind of wisdom and insight
9 when he revealed the mystery of his
plan to us. He had decided to do this
through Christ.
10 He planned to bring all of history to
its goal in Christ. Then Christ would be
the head of everything in heaven and on
earth.
11 God also decided ahead of me to
choose us through Christ according to
his plan, which makes everything work
the way he intends.EPHESIANS 1
3
12 He planned all of this so that we who
had already focused our hope on Christ
would praise him and give him glory.
13 You heard and believed the message
of truth, the Good News that he has
saved you. In him you were sealed with
the Holy Spirit whom he promised.
14 This Holy Spirit is the guarantee that
we will receive our inheritance. We have
this guarantee un l we are set free to
belong to him. God receives praise and
glory for this.
15 I, too, have heard about your faith in
the Lord Jesus and your love for all of
God’s people. For this reason
16 I never stop thanking God for you. I
always remember you in my prayers.
17 I pray that the glorious Father, the
God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would give
you a spirit of wisdom and revela on as
you come to know Christ be er.EPHESIANS 1
4
18 Then you will have deeper insight.
You will know the conﬁdence that he
calls you to have and the glorious wealth
that God’s people will inherit.
19 You will also know the unlimited
greatness of his power as it works with
might and strength for us, the believers.
20 He worked with that same power
in Christ when he brought him back to
life and gave him the highest posi on in
heaven.
21 He is far above all rulers, authori es,
powers, lords, and all other names that
can be named, not only in this present
world but also in the world to come.
22 God has put everything under the
control of Christ. He has made Christ the
head of everything for the good of the
church.
23 The church is Christ’s body and
completes him as he ﬁlls everything in
every way.EPHESIANS 2
2
5
1 You were once dead because of
your failures and sins.
2 You followed the ways of this present
world and its spiritual ruler. This ruler
con nues to work in people who refuse
to obey God.
3 All of us once lived among these
people, and followed the desires of our
corrupt nature. We did what our corrupt
desires and thoughts wanted us to do.
So, because of our nature, we deserved
God’s anger just like everyone else.
4 But God is rich in mercy because of
his great love for us.
5 We were dead because of our failures,
but he made us alive together with
Christ. (It is God’s kindness that saved
you.)
6 God has brought us back to life
together with Christ Jesus and has given
us a posi on in heaven with him.EPHESIANS 2
6
7 He did this through Christ Jesus out of
his generosity to us in order to show his
extremely rich kindness in the world to
come.
8 God saved you through faith as an act
of kindness. You had nothing to do with
it. Being saved is a gi from God.
9 It’s not the result of anything you’ve
done, so no one can brag about it.
10 God has made us what we are. He
has created us in Christ Jesus to live
lives ﬁlled with good works that he has
prepared for us to do.
11 Remember that once you were not
Jewish physically. Those who called
themselves "the circumcised" because
of what they had done to their bodies
called you "the uncircumcised."
12 Also, at that me you were without
Christ. You were excluded from
ci zenship in Israel, and the pledges God
made in his promise were foreign to you.EPHESIANS 2
7
You had no hope and were in the world
without God.
13 But now through Christ Jesus you,
who were once far away, have been
brought near by the blood of Christ.
14 So he is our peace. In his body
he has made Jewish and non–Jewish
people one by breaking down the wall of
hos lity that kept them apart.
15 He brought an end to the
commandments and demands
found in Moses’ Teachings so that
he could take Jewish and non–Jewish
people and create one new humanity in
himself. So he made peace.
16 He also brought them back to God in
one body by his cross, on which he killed
the hos lity.
17 He came with the Good News of
peace for you who were far away and for
those who were near.EPHESIANS 2 – 3
8
18 So Jewish and non–Jewish people
can go to the Father in one Spirit.
19 That is why you are no longer
foreigners and outsiders but ci zens
together with God’s people and
members of God’s family.
20 You are built on the founda on of
the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus
himself is the cornerstone.
21 In him all the parts of the building ﬁt
together and grow into a holy temple in
the Lord.
22 Through him you, also, are being
built in the Spirit together with others
into a place where God lives.
1 This is the reason I, Paul, am the
prisoner of Christ Jesus for those of
you who are not Jewish.
2 Certainly, you have heard how God
gave me the responsibility of bringing
his kindness to you.
3EPHESIANS 3
9
3 You have heard that he let me know
this mystery through a revela on. I’ve
already wri en to you about this brieﬂy.
4 When you read this, you’ll see that I
understand the mystery about Christ.
5 In the past, this mystery was not
known by people as it is now. The Spirit
has now revealed it to his holy apostles
and prophets.
6 This mystery is the Good News that
people who are not Jewish have the
same inheritance as Jewish people do.
They belong to the same body and share
the same promise that God made in
Christ Jesus.
7 I became a servant of this Good News
through God’s kindness freely given to
me when his power worked in me.
8 I am the least of all God’s people. Yet,
God showed me his kindness by allowing
me to spread the Good News of theEPHESIANS 3
10
immeasurable wealth of Christ to people
who are not Jewish.
9 He allowed me to explain the way this
mystery works. God, who created all
things, kept it hidden in the past.
10 He did this so that now, through
the church, he could let the rulers and
authori es in heaven know his inﬁnite
wisdom.
11 This was God’s plan for all of history
which he carried out through Christ
Jesus our Lord.
12 We can go to God with bold
conﬁdence through faith in Christ.
13 So then, I ask you not to become
discouraged by the troubles I suﬀer for
you. In fact, my troubles bring you glory.
14 This is the reason I kneel in the
presence of the Father
15 from whom all the family in heaven
and on earth receives its name.EPHESIANS 3
16 I’m asking God to give you a gi
11
from
the wealth of his glory. I pray that he
would give you inner strength and power
through his Spirit.
17 Then Christ will live in you through
faith. I also pray that love may be the
ground into which you sink your roots
and on which you have your founda on.
18 This way, with all of God’s people you
will be able to understand how wide,
long, high, and deep his love is.
19 You will know Christ’s love, which
goes far beyond any knowledge. I
am praying this so that you may be
completely ﬁlled with God.
20 Glory belongs to God, whose power
is at work in us. By this power he can
do inﬁnitely more than we can ask or
imagine.
21 Glory belongs to God in the church
and in Christ Jesus for all me and
eternity! Amen.EPHESIANS 4

12
1 I, a prisoner in the Lord, encourage
you to live the kind of life which
proves that God has called you.
2 Be humble and gentle in every way.
Be pa ent with each other and lovingly
accept each other.
3 Through the peace that es you
together, do your best to maintain the
unity that the Spirit gives.
4 There is one body and one Spirit. In
the same way you were called to share
one hope.
5 There is one Lord, one faith, one
bap sm,
6 one God and Father of all, who is over
everything, through everything, and in
everything.
7 God’s favor has been given to each of
us. It was measured out to us by Christ
who gave it.
8 That’s why the Scriptures say: "When
he went to the highest place, he tookEPHESIANS 4
13
cap ve those who had captured us and
gave gi s to people."
9 Now what does it mean that he went
up except that he also had gone down to
the lowest parts of the earth?
10 The one who had gone down also
went up above all the heavens so that
he ﬁlls everything.
11 He also gave apostles, prophets,
missionaries, as well as pastors and
teachers as gi s to his church.
12 Their purpose is to prepare God’s
people, to serve, and to build up the
body of Christ.
13 This is to con nue un l all of us are
united in our faith and in our knowledge
about God’s Son, un l we become
mature, un l we measure up to Christ,
who is the standard.
14 Then we will no longer be li le
children, tossed and carried about by all
kinds of teachings that change like theEPHESIANS 4
14
wind. We will no longer be inﬂuenced
by people who use cunning and clever
strategies to lead us astray.
15 Instead, as we lovingly speak the
truth, we will grow up completely in our
rela onship to Christ, who is the head.
16 He makes the whole body ﬁt together
and unites it through the support of
every joint. As each and every part does
its job, he makes the body grow so that
it builds itself up in love.
17 So I tell you and encourage you in the
Lord’s name not to live any longer like
other people in the world. Their minds
are set on worthless things.
18 They can’t understand because they
are in the dark. They are excluded from
the life that God approves of because of
their ignorance and stubbornness.
19 Since they no longer have any
sense of shame, they have become
promiscuous. They prac ce every kind ofEPHESIANS 4
15
sexual perversion with a constant desire
for more.
20 But that is not what you learned from
Christ’s teachings.
21 You have certainly heard his message
and have been taught his ways. The
truth is in Jesus.
22 You were taught to change the way
you were living. The person you used
to be will ruin you through desires that
deceive you.
23 However, you were taught to have a
new a tude.
24 You were also taught to become a
new person created to be like God, truly
righteous and holy.
25 So then, get rid of lies. Speak the
truth to each other, because we are all
members of the same body.
26 Be angry without sinning. Don’t go to
bed angry.EPHESIANS 4
16
27 Don’t give the devil any opportunity
to work.
28 Thieves must quit stealing and,
instead, they must work hard. They
should do something good with their
hands so that they’ll have something to
share with those in need.
29 Don’t say anything that would hurt
another person. Instead, speak only
what is good so that you can give help
wherever it is needed. That way, what
you say will help those who hear you.
30 Don’t give God’s Holy Spirit any
reason to be upset with you. He has put
his seal on you for the day you will be set
free from the world of sin.
31 Get rid of your bi erness, hot
tempers, anger, loud quarreling, cursing,
and hatred.
32 Be kind to each other, sympathe c,
forgiving each other as God has forgiven
you through Christ.EPHESIANS 5
5
17
1 Imitate God, since you are the
children he loves.
2 Live in love as Christ also loved us.
He gave his life for us as an oﬀering and
sacriﬁce, a soothing aroma to God.
3 Don’t let sexual sin, perversion of
any kind, or greed even be men oned
among you. This is not appropriate
behavior for God’s holy people.
4 It’s not right that dirty stories,
foolish talk, or obscene jokes should be
men oned among you either. Instead,
give thanks to God.
5 You know very well that no person
who is involved in sexual sin, perversion,
or greed (which means worshiping
wealth) can have any inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Don’t let anyone deceive you with
meaningless words. It is because of sins
like these that God’s anger comes to
those who refuse to obey him.EPHESIANS 5
18
7 Don’t be partners with them.
8 Once you lived in the dark, but now
the Lord has ﬁlled you with light. Live as
children who have light.
9 Light produces everything that is
good, that has God’s approval, and that
is true.
10 Determine which things please the
Lord.
11 Have nothing to do with the useless
works that darkness produces. Instead,
expose them for what they are.
12 It is shameful to talk about what
some people do in secret.
13 Light exposes the true character of
everything
14 because light makes everything easy
to see. That’s why it says: "Wake up,
sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Christ
will shine on you."EPHESIANS 5
19
15 So then, be very careful how you live.
Don’t live like foolish people but like
wise people.
16 Make the most of your opportuni es
because these are evil days.
17 So don’t be foolish, but understand
what the Lord wants.
18 Don’t get drunk on wine, which leads
to wild living. Instead, be ﬁlled with the
Spirit
19 by reci ng psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs for your own good. Sing
and make music to the Lord with your
hearts.
20 Always thank God the Father for
everything in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
21 Place yourselves under each other’s
authority out of respect for Christ.
22 Wives, place yourselves under your
husbands’ authority as you have placed
yourselves under the Lord’s authority.EPHESIANS 5
20
23 The husband is the head of his wife
as Christ is the head of the church. It is
his body, and he is its Savior.
24 As the church is under Christ’s
authority, so wives are under their
husbands’ authority in everything.
25 Husbands, love your wives as Christ
loved the church and gave his life for it.
26 He did this to make the church holy
by cleansing it, washing it using water
along with spoken words.
27 Then he could present it to himself
as a glorious church, without any kind
of stain or wrinkle––holy and without
faults.
28 So husbands must love their wives as
they love their own bodies. A man who
loves his wife loves himself.
29 No one ever hated his own body.
Instead, he feeds and takes care of it, as
Christ takes care of the church.
30 We are parts of his body.EPHESIANS 5 – 6
21
31 That’s why a man will leave his father
and mother and be united with his wife,
and the two will be one.
32 This is a great mystery. (I’m talking
about Christ’s rela onship to the
church.)
33 But every husband must love his wife
as he loves himself, and wives should
respect their husbands.
1 Children, obey your parents
because you are Chris ans. This is
the right thing to do.
2 "Honor your father and mother
3 that everything may go well for you,
and you may have a long life on earth."
This is an important commandment with
a promise.
4 Fathers, don’t make your children
bi er about life. Instead, bring them up
in Chris an discipline and instruc on.
6EPHESIANS 6
22
5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with
proper respect. Be as sincere as you are
when you obey Christ.
6 Don’t obey them only while you’re
being watched, as if you merely wanted
to please people. But obey like slaves
who belong to Christ, who have a deep
desire to do what God wants them to do.
7 Serve eagerly as if you were serving
your heavenly master and not merely
serving human masters.
8 You know that your heavenly master
will reward all of us for whatever good
we do, whether we’re slaves or free
people.
9 Masters, treat your slaves with
respect. Don’t threaten a slave. You
know that there is one master in heaven
who has authority over both of you, and
he doesn’t play favorites.
10 Finally, receive your power from the
Lord and from his mighty strength.EPHESIANS 6
23
11 Put on all the armor that God
supplies. In this way you can take a stand
against the devil’s strategies.
12 This is not a wrestling match against
a human opponent. We are wrestling
with rulers, authori es, the powers
who govern this world of darkness, and
spiritual forces that control evil in the
heavenly world.
13 For this reason, take up all the armor
that God supplies. Then you will be able
to take a stand during these evil days.
Once you have overcome all obstacles,
you will be able to stand your ground.
14 So then, take your stand! Fasten
truth around your waist like a belt. Put
on God’s approval as your breastplate.
15 Put on your shoes so that you are
ready to spread the Good News that
gives peace.
16 In addi on to all these, take the
Chris an faith as your shield. With it youEPHESIANS 6
24
can put out all the ﬂaming arrows of the
evil one.
17 Also take salva on as your helmet
and the word of God as the sword that
the Spirit supplies.
18 Pray in the Spirit in every situa on.
Use every kind of prayer and request
there is. For the same reason be alert.
Use every kind of eﬀort and make every
kind of request for all of God’s people.
19 Also pray that God will give me the
right words to say. Then I will speak
boldly when I reveal the mystery of the
Good News.
20 Because I have already been doing
this as Christ’s representa ve, I am in
prison. So pray that I speak about this
Good News as boldly as I have to.
21 I’m sending Tychicus to you. He is our
dear brother and a faithful deacon in the
Lord’s work. He will tell you everythingEPHESIANS 6
25
that is happening to me so that you will
know how I’m ge ng along.
22 That’s why I’m sending him to you so
that you may know how we’re doing and
that he may encourage you.
23 May God the Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ give our brothers and sisters
peace and love along with faith.
24 His favor is with everyone who has
an undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.Philippians

1 From Paul and Timothy, servants
of Christ Jesus. To God’s people in
the city of Philippi and their bishops and
deacons ––to everyone who is united
with Christ Jesus.
2 Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
3 I thank my God for all the memories I
have of you.
4 Every me I pray for all of you, I do it
with joy.
5 I can do this because of the
partnership we’ve had with you in
the Good News from the ﬁrst day you
believed un l now.
6 I’m convinced that God, who began
this good work in you, will carry itPHILIPPIANS 1
2
through to comple on on the day of
Christ Jesus.
7 You have a special place in my heart.
So it’s right for me to think this way
about all of you. All of you are my
partners. Together we share God’s favor,
whether I’m in prison or defending and
conﬁrming the truth of the Good News.
8 God is my witness that, with all the
compassion of Christ Jesus, I long to see
every one of you.
9 I pray that your love will keep on
growing because of your knowledge and
insight.
10 That way you will be able to
determine what is best and be pure and
blameless un l the day of Christ.
11 Jesus Christ will ﬁll your lives
with everything that God’s approval
produces. Your lives will then bring glory
and praise to God.PHILIPPIANS 1
3
12 I want you to know, brothers and
sisters, that what happened to me has
helped to spread the Good News.
13 As a result, it has become clear to
all the soldiers who guard the emperor
and to everyone else that I am in prison
because of Christ.
14 So through my being in prison, the
Lord has given most of our brothers and
sisters conﬁdence to speak God’s word
more boldly and fearlessly than ever.
15 Some people tell the message about
Christ because of their jealousy and
envy. Others tell the message about him
because of their good will.
16 Those who tell the message about
Christ out of love know that God has put
me here to defend the Good News.
17 But the others are insincere. They tell
the message about Christ out of selﬁsh
ambi on in order to s r up trouble for
me while I’m in prison.PHILIPPIANS 1
18 But what does it ma
4
er? Nothing
ma ers except that, in one way or
another, people are told the message
about Christ, whether with honest or
dishonest mo ves, and I’m happy about
that. Yes, I will con nue to be happy
19 for another reason. I know that I will
be set free through your prayers and
through the help that comes from the
Spirit of Jesus Christ.
20 I eagerly expect and hope that I will
have nothing to be ashamed of. I will
speak very boldly and honor Christ in my
body, now as always, whether I live or
die.
21 Christ means everything to me in this
life, and when I die I’ll have even more.
22 If I con nue to live in this life, my
work will produce more results. I don’t
know which I would prefer.
23 I ﬁnd it hard to choose between the
two. I would like to leave this life andPHILIPPIANS 1
5
be with Christ. That’s by far the be er
choice.
24 But for your sake it’s be er that I
remain in this life.
25 Since I’m convinced of this, I know
that I will con nue to live and be with all
of you. This will help you to grow and be
joyful in your faith.
26 So by coming to you again, I want to
give you even more reason to have pride
in Christ Jesus with me.
27 Live as ci zens who reﬂect the Good
News about Christ. Then, whether I
come to see you or whether I stay away,
I’ll hear all about you. I’ll hear that you
are ﬁrmly united in spirit, united in
ﬁgh ng for the faith that the Good News
brings.
28 So don’t let your opponents
in midate you in any way. This is God’s
way of showing them that they will be
destroyed and that you will be saved.PHILIPPIANS 1 – 2
6
29 God has given you the privilege not
only to believe in Christ but also to suﬀer
for him.
30 You are involved in the same struggle
that you saw me having. Now you hear
that I’m s ll involved in it.
1 So then, as Chris ans, do you have
any encouragement? Do you have
any comfort from love? Do you have any
spiritual rela onships? Do you have any
sympathy and compassion?
2 Then ﬁll me with joy by having the
same a tude and the same love, living
in harmony, and keeping one purpose in
mind.
3 Don’t act out of selﬁsh ambi on or
be conceited. Instead, humbly think of
others as being be er than yourselves.
4 Don’t be concerned only about your
own interests, but also be concerned
about the interests of others.
2PHILIPPIANS 2
5 Have the same a
7
tude that Christ
Jesus had.
6 Although he was in the form of God
and equal with God, he did not take
advantage of this equality.
7 Instead, he emp ed himself by taking
on the form of a servant, by becoming
like other humans, by having a human
appearance.
8 He humbled himself by becoming
obedient to the point of death, death on
a cross.
9 This is why God has given him an
excep onal honor––the name honored
above all other names––
10 so that at the name of Jesus everyone
in heaven, on earth, and in the world
below will kneel
11 and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
to the glory of God the Father.
12 My dear friends, you have always
obeyed, not only when I was with youPHILIPPIANS 2
8
but even more now that I’m absent. In
the same way con nue to work out your
salva on with fear and trembling.
13 It is God who produces in you the
desires and ac ons that please him.
14 Do everything without complaining
or arguing.
15 Then you will be blameless and
innocent. You will be God’s children
without any faults among people who
are crooked and corrupt. You will shine
like stars among them in the world
16 as you hold ﬁrmly to the word of life.
Then I can brag on the day of Christ that
my eﬀort was not wasted and that my
work produced results.
17 My life is being poured out as a part
of the sacriﬁce and service I oﬀer to God
for your faith. Yet, I am ﬁlled with joy,
and I share that joy with all of you.PHILIPPIANS 2
9
18 For this same reason you also should
be ﬁlled with joy and share that joy with
me.
19 I hope that the Lord Jesus will allow
me to send Timothy to you soon so that
I can receive some encouraging news
about you.
20 I don’t have anyone else like Timothy.
He takes a genuine interest in your
welfare.
21 Everyone else looks a er his own
interests, not a er those of Jesus Christ.
22 But you know what kind of person
Timothy proved to be. Like a father and
son we worked hard together to spread
the Good News.
23 I hope to send him as soon as I see
how things are going to turn out for me.
24 But the Lord gives me conﬁdence
that I will come to visit you soon.
25 I feel that I must send Epaphroditus–
–my brother, coworker, and fellowPHILIPPIANS 2 – 3
10
soldier––back to you. You sent him as
your personal representa ve to help me
in my need.
26 He has been longing to see all of you
and is troubled because you heard that
he was sick.
27 Indeed, he was so sick that he almost
died. But God had mercy not only on
him but also on me and kept me from
having one sorrow on top of another.
28 So I’m especially eager to send him to
you. In this way you will have the joy of
seeing him again and I will feel relieved.
29 Give him a joyful Chris an welcome.
Make sure you honor people like
Epaphroditus highly.
30 He risked his life and almost died for
the work of Christ in order to make up
for the help you couldn’t give me.
1 Now then, brothers and sisters, be
joyful in the Lord. It’s no trouble for
3PHILIPPIANS 3
11
me to write the same things to you, and
it’s for your safety.
2 Beware of dogs! Beware of those who
do evil things. Beware of those who
insist on circumcision.
3 We are the true circumcised people of
God because we serve God’s Spirit and
take pride in Christ Jesus. We don’t place
any conﬁdence in physical things,
4 although I could have conﬁdence in
my physical qualiﬁca ons. If anyone else
thinks that he can trust in something
physical, I can claim even more.
5 I was circumcised on the eighth day.
I’m a descendant of Israel. I’m from the
tribe of Benjamin. I’m a pure–blooded
Hebrew. When it comes to living up to
standards, I was a Pharisee.
6 When it comes to being enthusias c,
I was a persecutor of the church. When
it comes to winning God’s approval by
keeping Jewish laws, I was perfect.PHILIPPIANS 3
12
7 These things that I once considered
valuable, I now consider worthless for
Christ.
8 It’s far more than that! I consider
everything else worthless because I’m
much be er oﬀ knowing Christ Jesus my
Lord. It’s because of him that I think of
everything as worthless. I threw it all
away in order to gain Christ
9 and to have a rela onship with him.
This means that I didn’t receive God’s
approval by obeying his laws. The
opposite is true! I have God’s approval
through faith in Christ. This is the
approval that comes from God and is
based on faith
10 that knows Christ. Faith knows the
power that his coming back to life gives
and what it means to share his suﬀering.
In this way I’m becoming like him in his
death,PHILIPPIANS 3
13
11 with the conﬁdence that I’ll come
back to life from the dead.
12 It’s not that I’ve already reached
the goal or have already completed the
course. But I run to win that which Jesus
Christ has already won for me.
13 Brothers and sisters, I can’t consider
myself a winner yet. This is what I do:
I don’t look back, I lengthen my stride,
and
14 I run straight toward the goal to win
the prize that God’s heavenly call oﬀers
in Christ Jesus.
15 Whoever has a mature faith
should think this way. And if you think
diﬀerently, God will show you how to
think.
16 However, we should be guided by
what we have learned so far.
17 Brothers and sisters, imitate me, and
pay a en on to those who live by the
example we have given you.PHILIPPIANS 3 – 4
18 I have o
14
en told you, and now tell
you with tears in my eyes, that many live
as the enemies of the cross of Christ.
19 In the end they will be destroyed.
Their own emo ons are their god, and
they take pride in the shameful things
they do. Their minds are set on worldly
things.
20 We, however, are ci zens of heaven.
We look forward to the Lord Jesus Christ
coming from heaven as our Savior.
21 Through his power to bring
everything under his authority, he will
change our humble bodies and make
them like his gloriﬁed body.
1 So, brothers and sisters, I love you
and miss you. You are my joy and
my crown. Therefore, dear friends, keep
your rela onship with the Lord ﬁrm!
2 I encourage both Euodia and Syntyche
to have the a tude the Lord wants them
to have.
4PHILIPPIANS 4
15
3 Yes, I also ask you, Syzugus, my true
partner, to help these women. They
fought beside me to spread the Good
News along with Clement and the rest of
my coworkers, whose names are in the
Book of Life.
4 Always be joyful in the Lord! I’ll say it
again: Be joyful!
5 Let everyone know how considerate
you are. The Lord is near.
6 Never worry about anything. But
in every situa on let God know what
you need in prayers and requests while
giving thanks.
7 Then God’s peace, which goes beyond
anything we can imagine, will guard your
thoughts and emo ons through Christ
Jesus.
8 Finally, brothers and sisters, keep
your thoughts on whatever is right or
deserves praise: things that are true,PHILIPPIANS 4
16
honorable, fair, pure, acceptable, or
commendable.
9 Prac ce what you’ve learned and
received from me, what you heard and
saw me do. Then the God who gives this
peace will be with you.
10 The Lord has ﬁlled me with joy
because you again showed interest in
me. You were interested but did not
have an opportunity to show it.
11 I’m not saying this because I’m in
any need. I’ve learned to be content in
whatever situa on I’m in.
12 I know how to live in poverty or
prosperity. No ma er what the situa on,
I’ve learned the secret of how to live
when I’m full or when I’m hungry, when I
have too much or when I have too li le.
13 I can do everything through Christ
who strengthens me.
14 Nevertheless, it was kind of you to
share my troubles.PHILIPPIANS 4
17
15 You Philippians also know that in the
early days, when I le the province of
Macedonia to spread the Good News,
you were the only church to share your
money with me. You gave me what I
needed, and you received what I gave
you.
16 Even while I was in Thessalonica, you
provided for my needs twice.
17 It’s not that I’m looking for a gi . The
opposite is true. I’m looking for your
resources to increase.
18 You have paid me in full, and I
have more than enough. Now that
Epaphroditus has brought me your gi s,
you have ﬁlled my needs. Your gi s are
a soothing aroma, a sacriﬁce that God
accepts and with which he is pleased.
19 My God will richly ﬁll your every need
in a glorious way through Christ Jesus.
20 Glory belongs to our God and Father
forever! Amen.PHILIPPIANS 4
18
21 Greet everyone who believes in
Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters
who are with me send gree ngs to you.
22 All God’s people here, especially
those in the emperor’s palace, greet you.
23 May the good will of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you.Colossians

1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus by God’s will, and from our
brother Timothy.
2 To God’s holy and faithful people,
our brothers and sisters who are united
with Christ in the city of Colossae. Good
will and peace from God our Father are
yours!
3 We always thank God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, in our prayers for
you.
4 We thank God because we have heard
about your faith in Christ Jesus and your
love for all of God’s people.
5 You have these because of the hope
which is kept safe for you in heaven.
Some me ago you heard about thisCOLOSSIANS 1
2
hope in the Good News which is the
message of truth.
6 This Good News is present with
you now. It is producing results and
spreading all over the world as it did
among you from the ﬁrst day you heard
it. At that me you came to know what
God’s kindness truly means.
7 You learned about this Good News
from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant.
He is taking your place here as a
trustworthy deacon for Christ
8 and has told us about the love that
the Spirit has given you.
9 For this reason we have not stopped
praying for you since the day we heard
about you. We ask God to ﬁll you with
the knowledge of his will through every
kind of spiritual wisdom and insight.
10 We ask this so that you will live
the kind of lives that prove you belong
to the Lord. Then you will want toCOLOSSIANS 1
3
please him in every way as you grow in
producing every kind of good work by
this knowledge about God.
11 We ask him to strengthen you by his
glorious might with all the power you
need to pa ently endure everything
with joy.
12 You will also thank the Father, who
has made you able to share the light,
which is what God’s people inherit.
13 God has rescued us from the power
of darkness and has brought us into the
kingdom of his Son, whom he loves.
14 His Son paid the price to free us,
which means that our sins are forgiven.
15 He is the image of the invisible God,
the ﬁrstborn of all crea on.
16 He created all things in heaven
and on earth, visible and invisible.
Whether they are kings or lords, rulers or
powers–– everything has been created
through him and for him.COLOSSIANS 1
4
17 He existed before everything and
holds everything together.
18 He is also the head of the church,
which is his body. He is the beginning,
the ﬁrst to come back to life so that he
would have ﬁrst place in everything.
19 God was pleased to have all of
himself live in Christ.
20 God was also pleased to bring
everything on earth and in heaven back
to himself through Christ. He did this
by making peace through Christ’s blood
sacriﬁced on the cross.
21 Once you were separated from God.
The evil things you did showed your
hos le a tude.
22 But now Christ has brought you back
to God by dying in his physical body.
He did this so that you could come into
God’s presence without sin, fault, or
blame.COLOSSIANS 1
23 This is on the condi
5
on that you
con nue in faith without being moved
from the solid founda on of the hope
that the Good News contains. You’ve
heard this Good News of which I, Paul,
became a servant. It has been spread
throughout all crea on under heaven.
24 I am happy to suﬀer for you now.
In my body I am comple ng whatever
remains of Christ’s suﬀerings. I am doing
this on behalf of his body, the church.
25 I became a servant of the church
when God gave me the work of telling
you his en re message.
26 In the past God hid this mystery, but
now he has revealed it to his people.
27 God wanted his people throughout
the world to know the glorious riches of
this mystery––which is Christ living in
you, giving you the hope of glory.
28 We spread the message about Christ
as we instruct and teach everyone withCOLOSSIANS 1 – 2
6
all the wisdom there is. We want to
present everyone as mature Chris an
people.
29 I work hard and struggle to do this
while his mighty power works in me.
1 I want you to know how hard I work
for you, for the people of Laodicea,
and for people I have never met.
2 Because they are united in love, I
work so that they may be encouraged
by all the riches that come from a
complete understanding of Christ. He is
the mystery of God.
3 God has hidden all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge in Christ.
4 I say this so that no one will mislead
you with arguments that merely sound
good.
5 Although I’m absent from you
physically, I’m with you in spirit. I’m
happy to see how orderly you are and
how ﬁrm your faith in Christ is.
2COLOSSIANS 2
7
6 You received Christ Jesus the Lord, so
con nue to live as Christ’s people.
7 Sink your roots in him and build on
him. Be strengthened by the faith that
you were taught, and overﬂow with
thanksgiving.
8 Be careful not to let anyone rob
you of this faith through a shallow and
misleading philosophy. Such a person
follows human tradi ons and the world’s
way of doing things rather than following
Christ.
9 All of God lives in Christ’s body,
10 and God has made you complete in
Christ. Christ is in charge of every ruler
and authority.
11 In him you were also circumcised. It
was not a circumcision performed by
human hands. But it was a removal of
the corrupt nature in the circumcision
performed by Christ.COLOSSIANS 2
8
12 This happened when you were
placed in the tomb with Christ through
bap sm. In bap sm you were also
brought back to life with Christ through
faith in the power of God, who brought
him back to life.
13 You were once dead because of your
failures and your uncircumcised corrupt
nature. But God made you alive with
Christ when he forgave all our failures.
14 He did this by erasing the charges
that were brought against us by the
wri en laws God had established. He
took the charges away by nailing them
to the cross.
15 He stripped the rulers and authori es
of their power and made a public
spectacle of them as he celebrated his
victory in Christ.
16 Therefore, let no one judge you
because of what you eat or drink or
about the observance of annual holyCOLOSSIANS 2
9
days, New Moon Fes vals, or weekly
worship days.
17 These are a shadow of the things
to come, but the body that casts the
shadow belongs to Christ.
18 Let no one who delights in false
humility and the worship of angels tell
you that you don’t deserve a prize. Such
a person, whose sinful mind ﬁlls him
with arrogance, gives endless details of
the visions he has seen.
19 He doesn’t hold on to Christ, the
head. Christ makes the whole body grow
as God wants it to, through support and
unity given by the joints and ligaments.
20 If you have died with Christ to the
world’s way of doing things, why do you
let others tell you how to live? It’s as
though you were s ll under the world’s
inﬂuence.
21 People will tell you, "Don’t handle
this! Don’t taste or touch that!"COLOSSIANS 2 – 3
10
22 All of these things deal with objects
that are only used up anyway.
23 These things look like wisdom
with their self–imposed worship, false
humility, and harsh treatment of the
body. But they have no value for holding
back the constant desires of your corrupt
nature.
1 Since you were brought back to
life with Christ, focus on the things
that are above––where Christ holds the
highest posi on.
2 Keep your mind on things above, not
on worldly things.
3 You have died, and your life is hidden
with Christ in God.
4 Christ is your life. When he appears,
then you, too, will appear with him in
glory.
5 Therefore, put to death whatever
is worldly in you: your sexual sin,
perversion, passion, lust, and greed
3COLOSSIANS 3
11
(which is the same thing as worshiping
wealth).
6 It is because of these sins that God’s
anger comes on those who refuse to
obey him.
7 You used to live that kind of sinful life.
8 Also get rid of your anger, hot tempers,
hatred, cursing, obscene language, and
all similar sins.
9 Don’t lie to each other. You’ve go en
rid of the person you used to be and the
life you used to live,
10 and you’ve become a new person.
This new person is con nually renewed
in knowledge to be like its Creator.
11 Where this happens, there is
no Greek or Jew, circumcised or
uncircumcised, barbarian, uncivilized
person, slave, or free person. Instead,
Christ is everything and in everything.COLOSSIANS 3
12
12 As holy people whom God has
chosen and loved, be sympathe c, kind,
humble, gentle, and pa ent.
13 Put up with each other, and forgive
each other if anyone has a complaint.
Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
14 Above all, be loving.This es
everything together perfectly.
15 Also, let Christ’s peace control you.
God has called you into this peace by
bringing you into one body. Be thankful.
16 Let Christ’s word with all its wisdom
and richness live in you. Use psalms,
hymns, and spiritual songs to teach
and instruct yourselves about God’s
kindness. Sing to God in your hearts.
17 Everything you say or do should be
done in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God the Father through
him.COLOSSIANS 3

18 Wives, place yourselves under your
husbands’ authority. This is appropriate
behavior for the Lord’s people.
19 Husbands, love your wives, and don’t
be harsh with them.
20 Children, always obey your parents.
This is pleasing to the Lord.
21 Fathers, don’t make your children
resen ul, or they will become
discouraged.
22 Slaves, always obey your earthly
masters. Don’t obey them only while
you’re being watched, as if you merely
wanted to please people. Be sincere in
your mo ves out of respect for your real
master.
23 Whatever you do, do it
wholeheartedly as though you
were working for your real master and
not merely for humans.
24 You know that your real master will
give you an inheritance as your reward.COLOSSIANS 3 – 4

It is Christ, your real master, whom you

God does not play favorites.
1 Masters, be just and fair to your
slaves because you know that you
also have a master in heaven.
2 Keep praying. Pay a en on when you
oﬀer prayers of thanksgiving.
3 At the same me also pray for us. Pray
that God will give us an opportunity to
speak the word so that we may tell the
mystery about Christ. It is because of
this mystery that I am a prisoner.
4 Pray that I may make this mystery as
clear as possible. This is what I have to
do.

Christ. Good will and peace are yours!
2 We always thank God for all of you as
we remember you in our prayers.
3 In the presence of our God and Father,
we never forget that your faith is ac ve,
your love is working hard, and your
conﬁdence in our Lord Jesus Christ is
enduring.
4 Brothers and sisters, we never forget
this because we know that God loves
you and has chosen you.
5 We know this because the Good News
we brought came to you not only with
words but also with power, with the
Holy Spirit, and with complete certainty.1 THESSALONIANS 1
2
In the same way you know what kind of
people we were while we were with you
and the good things we did for you.
6 You imitated us and the Lord. In spite
of a lot of suﬀering, you welcomed God’s
word with the kind of joy that the Holy
Spirit gives.
7 This way, you became a model for
all the believers in the province of
Macedonia and Greece.
8 From you the Lord’s word has spread
out not only through the province of
Macedonia and Greece but also to
people everywhere who have heard
about your faith in God. We don’t need
to say a thing about it.
9 They talk about how you welcomed
us when we arrived. They even report
how you turned away from false gods to
serve the real, living God
10 and to wait for his Son to come
from heaven. His Son is Jesus, whom he1 THESSALONIANS 2
3
brought back to life. Jesus is the one who
rescues us from God’s coming anger.
1 You know, brothers and sisters, that
our me with you was not wasted.
2 As you know, we suﬀered rough and
insul ng treatment in Philippi. But our
God gave us the courage to tell you his
Good News in spite of strong opposi on.
3 When we encouraged you, we
didn’t use unethical schemes, corrupt
prac ces, or decep on.
4 Rather, we are always spreading the
Good News. God trusts us to do this
because we passed his test. We don’t try
to please people but God, who tests our
mo ves.
5 As you know, we never used ﬂa ery
or schemes to make money. God is our
witness!
6 We didn’t seek praise from people,
from you or from anyone else,
21 THESSALONIANS 2
4
7 although as apostles of Christ we had
the right to do this. Instead, we were
gentle when we were with you, like a
mother taking care of her children.
8 We felt so strongly about you that we
were determined to share with you not
only the Good News of God but also our
lives. That’s how dear you were to us!
9 You remember, brothers and sisters,
our work and what we did to earn a
living. We worked night and day so that
we could bring you the Good News of
God without being a burden to any of
you.
10 You and God are witnesses of how
pure, honest, and blameless we were in
our dealings with you believers.
11 You know very well that we treated
each of you the way a father treats
his children. We comforted you and
encouraged you. Yet, we insisted that1 THESSALONIANS 2
5
12 you should live in a way that proves
you belong to the God who calls you into
his kingdom and glory.
13 Here is another reason why we never
stop thanking God: When you received
God’s word from us, you realized it
wasn’t the word of humans. Instead,
you accepted it for what it really is––the
word of God. This word is at work in you
believers.
14 You, brothers and sisters, were like
the churches of God in Judea that are
united with Christ Jesus. You suﬀered
the same persecu ons from the people
of your own country as those churches
did from the Jews
15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the
prophets and who have persecuted us
severely. They are displeasing to God.
They are enemies of the whole human
race1 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
16 because they try to keep us from
telling people who are not Jewish how
they can be saved. The result is that
those Jews always commit as many sins
as possible. So at last they are receiving
God’s anger.
17 Brothers and sisters, we have been
separated from you for a li le while.
Although we may not be able to see you,
you’re always in our thoughts. We have
made every possible eﬀort to fulﬁll our
desire to see you.
18 We wanted to visit you. I, Paul,
wanted to visit you twice already, but
Satan made that impossible.
19 Who is our hope, joy, or prize that we
can brag about in the presence of our
Lord Jesus when he comes? Isn’t it you?
20 You are our glory and joy!
1 We thought it best to remain in
Athens by ourselves. But, because
31 THESSALONIANS 3
7
we couldn’t wait any longer for news
about you,
2 we sent our brother Timothy to you.
He serves God by spreading the Good
News about Christ. His mission was to
strengthen and encourage you in your
faith
3 so that these troubles don’t disturb
any of you. You know that we’re des ned
to suﬀer persecu on.
4 In fact, when we were with you, we
told you ahead of me that we were
going to suﬀer persecu on. And as you
know, that’s what happened.
5 But when I couldn’t wait any longer,
I sent Timothy to ﬁnd out about your
faith. I wanted to see whether the
tempter had in some way tempted you,
making our work meaningless.
6 But Timothy has just now come back
to us from you and has told us the good
news about your faith and love. He1 THESSALONIANS 3
8
also told us that you always have fond
memories of us and want to see us, as
we want to see you.
7 So brothers and sisters, your faith has
encouraged us in all our distress and
trouble.
8 Now we can go on living as long as
you keep your rela onship with the Lord
ﬁrm.
9 We can never thank God enough for
all the joy you give us as we rejoice in
God’s presence.
10 We pray very hard night and day that
we may see you again so that we can
supply whatever you s ll need for your
faith.
11 We pray that God our Father and the
Lord Jesus will guide us to you.
12 We also pray that the Lord will greatly
increase your love for each other and for
everyone else, just as we love you.1 THESSALONIANS 3 – 4
9
13 Then he will strengthen you to be
holy. Then you will be blameless in the
presence of our God and Father when
our Lord Jesus comes with all God’s holy
people.
1 Now then, brothers and sisters,
because of the Lord Jesus we ask
and encourage you to excel in living a
God–pleasing life even more than you
already do. Do this the way we taught
you.
2 You know what orders we gave you
through the Lord Jesus.
3 It is God’s will that you keep away from
sexual sin as a mark of your devo on to
him.
4 Each of you should know that ﬁnding
a husband or wife for yourself is to be
done in a holy and honorable way,
5 not in the passionate, lus ul way of
people who don’t know God.
41 THESSALONIANS 4
10
6 No one should take advantage of or
exploit other believers that way. The
Lord is the one who punishes people for
all these things. We’ve already told you
and warned you about this.
7 God didn’t call us to be sexually
immoral but to be holy.
8 Therefore, whoever rejects this order
is not rejec ng human authority but
God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.
9 You don’t need anyone to write to you
about the way Chris ans should love
each other. God has taught you to love
each other.
10 In fact, you are showing love to all
the Chris ans throughout the province
of Macedonia. We encourage you as
believers to excel in love even more.
11 Also, make it your goal to live quietly,
do your work, and earn your own living,
as we ordered you.1 THESSALONIANS 4
11
12 Then your way of life will win respect
from those outside the church, and you
won’t have to depend on anyone else for
what you need.
13 Brothers and sisters, we don’t want
you to be ignorant about those who
have died. We don’t want you to grieve
like other people who have no hope.
14 We believe that Jesus died and
came back to life. We also believe that,
through Jesus, God will bring back those
who have died. They will come back with
Jesus.
15 We are telling you what the Lord
taught. We who are s ll alive when the
Lord comes will not go into his kingdom
ahead of those who have already died.
16 The Lord will come from heaven
with a command, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trumpet call
of God. First, the dead who believed in
Christ will come back to life.1 THESSALONIANS 4 – 5
12
17 Then, together with them, we who
are s ll alive will be taken in the clouds
to meet the Lord in the air. In this way
we will always be with the Lord.
18 So then, comfort each other with
these words!
1 Brothers and sisters, you don’t
need anyone to write to you about
mes and dates.
2 You know very well that the day of the
Lord will come like a thief in the night.
3 When people say, "Everything is safe
and sound!" destruc on will suddenly
strike them. It will be as sudden as labor
pains come to a pregnant woman. They
won’t be able to escape.
4 But, brothers and sisters, you don’t
live in the dark. That day won’t take you
by surprise as a thief would.
5 You belong to the day and the light
not to the night and the dark.
51 THESSALONIANS 5
13
6 Therefore, we must not fall asleep like
other people, but we must stay awake
and be sober.
7 People who sleep, sleep at night;
people who get drunk, get drunk at
night.
8 Since we belong to the day, we must
be sober. We must put on faith and
love as a breastplate and the hope of
salva on as a helmet.
9 It was not God’s inten on that we
experience his anger but that we obtain
salva on through our Lord Jesus Christ.
10 He died for us so that, whether we
are awake in this life or asleep in death,
we will live together with him.
11 Therefore, encourage each other
and strengthen one another as you are
doing.
12 Brothers and sisters, we ask you to
show your apprecia on for those leaders
who work among you and instruct you.1 THESSALONIANS 5
14
13 We ask you to love them and think
very highly of them because of the work
they are doing. Live in peace with each
other.
14 We encourage you, brothers and
sisters, to instruct those who are not
living right, cheer up those who are
discouraged, help the weak, and be
pa ent with everyone.
15 Make sure that no one ever pays
back one wrong with another wrong.
Instead, always try to do what is good
for each other and everyone else.
16 Always be joyful.
17 Never stop praying.
18 Whatever happens, give thanks,
because it is God’s will in Christ Jesus
that you do this.
19 Don’t put out the Spirit’s ﬁre.
20 Don’t despise what God has revealed.
21 Instead, test everything. Hold on to
what is good.1 THESSALONIANS 5
15
22 Keep away from every kind of evil.
23 May the God who gives peace make
you holy in every way. May he keep
your whole being––spirit, soul, and
body––blameless when our Lord Jesus
Christ comes.
24 The one who calls you is faithful, and
he will do this.
25 Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
26 Greet all the brothers and sisters
with a holy kiss.
27 In the Lord’s name, I order you to
read this le er to all the brothers and
sisters.
28 The good will of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with you.2 Thessalonians
1
1 From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. To
the church at Thessalonica united
with God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
2 Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
3 We always have to thank God for
you, brothers and sisters. It’s right to
do this because your faith is showing
remarkable growth and your love for
each other is increasing.
4 That’s why we brag in God’s churches
about your endurance and faith in all
the persecu ons and suﬀering you are
experiencing.2 THESSALONIANS 1
2
5 Your suﬀering proves that God’s
judgment is right and that you are
considered worthy of his kingdom.
6 Certainly, it is right for God to give
suﬀering to those who cause you to
suﬀer.
7 It is also right for God to give all of us
relief from our suﬀering. He will do this
when the Lord Jesus is revealed, coming
from heaven with his mighty angels in a
blazing ﬁre.
8 He will take revenge on those who
refuse to acknowledge God and on those
who refuse to respond to the Good
News about our Lord Jesus.
9 They will pay the penalty by being
destroyed forever, by being separated
from the Lord’s presence and from his
glorious power.
10 This will happen on that day when
he comes to be honored among all his
holy people and admired by all who2 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
3
have believed in him. This includes you
because you believed the tes mony we
gave you.
11 With this in mind, we always pray
that our God will make you worthy of his
call. We also pray that through his power
he will help you accomplish every good
desire and help you do everything your
faith produces.
12 That way the name of our Lord
Jesus will be honored among you. Then,
because of the good will of Jesus Christ,
our God and Lord, you will be honored
by him.
1 Brothers and sisters, we have this
request to make of you about our
Lord Jesus Christ’s coming and our
gathering to meet him.
2 Don’t get upset right away or alarmed
when someone claims that we said
through some spirit, conversa on, or
22 THESSALONIANS 2
4
le er that the day of the Lord has
already come.
3 Don’t let anyone deceive you about
this in any way. That day cannot come
unless a revolt takes place ﬁrst, and the
man of sin, the man of destruc on, is
revealed.
4 He opposes every so–called god or
anything that is worshiped and places
himself above them, si ng in God’s
temple and claiming to be God.
5 Don’t you remember that I told you
about these things when I was s ll with
you?
6 You know what it is that now holds
him back, so that he will be revealed
when his me comes.
7 The mystery of this sin is already at
work. But it cannot work eﬀec vely un l
the person now holding it back gets out
of the way.2 THESSALONIANS 2
5
8 Then the man of sin will be revealed
and the Lord Jesus will destroy him
by what he says. When the Lord Jesus
comes, his appearance will put an end to
this man.
9 The man of sin will come with the
power of Satan. He will use every kind
of power, including miraculous and
wonderful signs. But they will be lies.
10 He will use everything that God
disapproves of to deceive those who are
dying, those who refused to love the
truth that would save them.
11 That’s why God will send them a
powerful delusion so that they will
believe a lie.
12 Then everyone who did not believe
the truth, but was delighted with what
God disapproves of, will be condemned.
13 We always have to thank God for
you, brothers and sisters. You are loved
by the Lord and we thank God that in2 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
the beginning he chose you to be saved
through a life of spiritual devo on and
faith in the truth.
14 With this in mind he called you by
the Good News which we told you so
that you would obtain the glory of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
15 Then, brothers and sisters, ﬁrmly
hold on to the tradi ons we taught you
either when we spoke to you or in our
le er.
16 God our Father loved us and
by his kindness gave us everlas ng
encouragement and good hope.
Together with our Lord Jesus Christ,
17 may he encourage and strengthen
you to do and say everything that is
good.
1 Finally, brothers and sisters, pray
that we spread the Lord’s word
rapidly and that it will be honored the
way it was among you.
32 THESSALONIANS 3
7
2 Also pray that we may be rescued
from worthless and evil people, since
not everyone shares our faith.
3 But the Lord is faithful and will
strengthen you and protect you against
the evil one.
4 The Lord gives us conﬁdence that you
are doing and will con nue to do what
we ordered you to do.
5 May the Lord direct your lives as you
show God’s love and Christ’s endurance.
6 Brothers and sisters, in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ we order you not to
associate with any believer who doesn’t
live a disciplined life and doesn’t follow
the tradi on you received from us.
7 You know what you must do to imitate
us. We lived a disciplined life among you.
8 We didn’t eat anyone’s food without
paying for it. Instead, we worked hard
and struggled night and day in order not
to be a burden to any of you.2 THESSALONIANS 3
8
9 It’s not as though we didn’t have a
right to receive support. Rather, we
wanted to set an example for you to
follow.
10 While we were with you, we gave
you the order: "Whoever doesn’t want
to work shouldn’t be allowed to eat."
11 We hear that some of you are
not living disciplined lives. You’re not
working, so you go around interfering in
other people’s lives.
12 We order and encourage such people
by the Lord Jesus Christ to pay a en on
to their own work so they can support
themselves.
13 Brothers and sisters, we can’t allow
ourselves to get red of doing what is
right.
14 It may be that some people will not
listen to what we say in this le er. Take
note of them and don’t associate with
them so that they will feel ashamed.2 THESSALONIANS 3
9
15 Yet, don’t treat them like enemies,
but instruct them like brothers and
sisters.
16 May the Lord of peace give you his
peace at all mes and in every way. The
Lord be with all of you.
17 I, Paul, am wri ng this gree ng with
my own hand. In every le er that I send,
this is proof that I wrote it.
18 The good will of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with all of you.1 Timothy
1
1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus by the command of God our
Savior and Christ Jesus our conﬁdence.
2 To Timothy, a genuine child in faith.
Good will, mercy, and peace from God
the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord are
yours!
3 When I was going to the province of
Macedonia, I encouraged you to stay in
the city of Ephesus. That way you could
order certain people to stop teaching
false doctrine
4 and occupying themselves with myths
and endless genealogies. These myths
and genealogies raise a lot of ques ons
rather than promo ng God’s plan, which
centers in faith.1 TIMOTHY 1
2
5 My goal in giving you this order is for
love to ﬂow from a pure heart, from a
clear conscience, and from a sincere
faith.
6 Some people have le these quali es
behind and have turned to useless
discussions.
7 They want to be experts in Moses’
Teachings. However, they don’t
understand what they’re talking about
or the things about which they speak so
conﬁdently.
8 We know that Moses’ Teachings are
good if they are used as they were
intended to be used.
9 For example, a person must realize
that laws are not intended for people
who have God’s approval. Laws are
intended for lawbreakers and rebels, for
ungodly people and sinners, for those
who think nothing is holy or sacred,1 TIMOTHY 1
3
for those who kill their fathers, their
mothers, or other people.
10 Laws are intended for people
involved in sexual sins, for homosexuals,
for kidnappers, for liars, for those
who lie when they take an oath, and
for whatever else is against accurate
teachings.
11 Moses’ Teachings were intended to
be used in agreement with the Good
News that contains the glory of the
blessed God. I was entrusted with that
Good News.
12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord that he
has trusted me and has appointed me
to do his work with the strength he has
given me.
13 In the past I cursed him, persecuted
him, and acted arrogantly toward
him. However, I was treated with
mercy because I acted ignorantly in my
unbelief.1 TIMOTHY 1
4
14 Our Lord was very kind to me.
Through his kindness he brought me to
faith and gave me the love that Christ
Jesus shows people.
15 This is a statement that can be trusted
and deserves complete acceptance:
Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners, and I am the foremost sinner.
16 However, I was treated with mercy
so that Christ Jesus could use me, the
foremost sinner, to demonstrate his
pa ence. This pa ence serves as an
example for those who would believe in
him and live forever.
17 Worship and glory belong forever to
the eternal king, the immortal, invisible,
and only God. Amen.
18 Timothy, my child, I’m giving you this
order about the prophecies that are s ll
coming to you: Use these prophecies in
faith and with a clear conscience to ﬁght
this noble war.1 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
5
19 Some have refused to let their faith
guide their conscience and their faith
has been destroyed like a wrecked ship.
20 Among these people are Hymenaeus
and Alexander, whom I have handed
over to Satan in order to teach them not
to dishonor God.
1 First of all, I encourage you to make
pe ons, prayers, intercessions, and
prayers of thanks for all people,
2 for rulers, and for everyone who has
authority over us. Pray for these people
so that we can have a quiet and peaceful
life always lived in a godly and reverent
way.
3 This is good and pleases God our
Savior.
4 He wants all people to be saved and
to learn the truth.
5 There is one God. There is also one
mediator between God and humans––a
human, Christ Jesus.
21 TIMOTHY 2
6
6 He sacriﬁced himself for all people to
free them from their sins. This message
is valid for every era.
7 I was appointed to spread this Good
News and to be an apostle to teach
people who are not Jewish about faith
and truth. I’m telling you the truth. I’m
not lying.
8 I want men to oﬀer prayers
everywhere. They should raise their
hands in prayer a er pu ng aside their
anger and any quarrels they have with
anyone.
9 I want women to show their beauty by
dressing in appropriate clothes that are
modest and respectable. Their beauty
will be shown by what they do, not by
their hair styles or the gold jewelry,
pearls, or expensive clothes they wear.
10 This is what is proper for women who
claim to have reverence for God.1 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
7
11 A woman must learn in silence, in
keeping with her posi on.
12 I don’t allow a woman to teach or to
have authority over a man. Instead, she
should be quiet.
13 A er all, Adam was formed ﬁrst, then
Eve.
14 Besides that, Adam was not deceived.
It was the woman who was deceived
and sinned.
15 However, she and all women will be
saved through the birth of the child, if
they lead respectable lives in faith, love,
and holiness.
1 This is a statement that can be
trusted: If anyone sets his heart on
being a bishop, he desires something
excellent.
2 A bishop must have a good reputa on.
He must have only one wife, be sober,
use good judgment, be respectable, be
hospitable, and be able to teach.
31 TIMOTHY 3
8
3 He must not drink excessively or be a
violent person, but he must be gentle.
He must not be quarrelsome or love
money.
4 He must manage his own family well.
His children should respec ully obey
him.
5 (If a man doesn’t know how to
manage his own family, how can he take
care of God’s church?)
6 He must not be a new Chris an, or
he might become arrogant like the devil
and be condemned.
7 People who are not Chris ans must
speak well of him, or he might become
the vic m of disgraceful insults that the
devil sets as traps for him.
8 Deacons must also be of good
character. They must not be two–faced
or addicted to alcohol. They must not
use shameful ways to make money.1 TIMOTHY 3
9
9 They must have clear consciences
about possessing the mystery of the
Chris an faith.
10 First, a person must be evaluated.
Then, if he has a good reputa on, he
may become a deacon.
11 Their wives must also be of good
character. They must not be gossips, but
they must control their tempers and be
trustworthy in every way.
12 A deacon must have only one wife.
Deacons must manage their children
and their families well.
13 Those deacons who serve well gain
an excellent reputa on and will have
conﬁdence as a result of their faith in
Christ Jesus.
14 I hope to visit you soon. However, I’m
wri ng this to you
15 in case I’m delayed. I want you to
know how people who are members of
God’s family must live. God’s family is1 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
10
the church of the living God, the pillar
and founda on of the truth.
16 The mystery that gives us our
reverence for God is acknowledged to be
great: He appeared in his human nature,
was approved by the Spirit, was seen by
angels, was announced throughout the
na ons, was believed in the world, and
was taken to heaven in glory.
1 The Spirit says clearly that in later
mes some believers will desert the
Chris an faith. They will follow spirits
that deceive, and they will believe the
teachings of demons.
2 These people will speak lies disguised
as truth. Their consciences have been
scarred as if branded by a red–hot iron.
3 They will try to stop others from
ge ng married and from ea ng certain
foods. God created food to be received
with prayers of thanks by those who
believe and know the truth.
41 TIMOTHY 4
11
4 Everything God created is good.
Nothing should be rejected if it is
received with prayers of thanks.
5 The word of God and prayer set it
apart as holy.
6 You are a good servant of Christ Jesus
when you point these things out to our
brothers and sisters. Then you will be
nourished by the words of the Chris an
faith and the excellent teachings which
you have followed closely.
7 Don’t have anything to do with
godless myths that old women like to
tell. Rather, train yourself to live a godly
life.
8 Training the body helps a li le, but
godly living helps in every way. Godly
living has the promise of life now and in
the world to come.
9 This is a statement that can be trusted
and deserves complete acceptance.1 TIMOTHY 4
12
10 Certainly, we work hard and struggle
to live a godly life, because we place our
conﬁdence in the living God. He is the
Savior of all people, especially of those
who believe.
11 Insist on these things and teach
them.
12 Don’t let anyone look down on you
for being young. Instead, make your
speech, behavior, love, faith, and purity
an example for other believers.
13 Un l I get there, concentrate on
reading Scripture in worship, giving
encouraging messages, and teaching
people.
14 Don’t neglect the gi which you
received through prophecy when the
spiritual leaders placed their hands on
you to ordain you.
15 Prac ce these things. Devote your
life to them so that everyone can see
your progress.1 TIMOTHY 4 – 5
13
16 Focus on your life and your teaching.
Con nue to do what I’ve told you. If you
do this, you will save yourself and those
who hear you.
1 Never use harsh words when you
correct an older man, but talk to him
as if he were your father. Talk to younger
men as if they were your brothers,
2 older women as if they were your
mothers, and younger women as if they
were your sisters, while keeping yourself
morally pure.
3 Honor widows who have no families.
4 The children or grandchildren of a
widow must ﬁrst learn to respect their
own family by repaying their parents.
This is pleasing in God’s sight.
5 A widow who has no family has placed
her conﬁdence in God by praying and
asking for his help night and day.
6 But the widow who lives for pleasure
is dead although she is s ll alive.

7 Insist on these things so that widows
will have good reputa ons.
8 If anyone doesn’t take care of his
own rela ves, especially his immediate
family, he has denied the Chris an faith
and is worse than an unbeliever.
9 Any widow who had only one husband
and is at least 60 years old should be put
on your list of widows.
10 People should tell about the good
things she has done: raising children,
being hospitable, taking care of
believers’ needs, helping the suﬀering,
or always doing good things.
11 Don’t include younger widows on
your list. Whenever their natural desires
become stronger than their devo on to
Christ, they’ll want to marry.
12 They condemn themselves by
rejec ng the Chris an faith, the faith
they ﬁrst accepted.1 TIMOTHY 5
13 At the same
15
me, they learn to go
around from house to house since they
have nothing else to do. Not only this,
but they also gossip and get involved in
other people’s business, saying things
they shouldn’t say.
14 So I want younger widows to marry,
have children, manage their homes,
and not give the enemy any chance to
ridicule them.
15 Some of them have already turned
away to follow Satan.
16 If any woman is a believer and has
rela ves who are widows, she should
help them. In this way the church is not
burdened and can help widows who
have no families.
17 Give double honor to spiritual
leaders who handle their du es well.
This is especially true if they work hard
at teaching the word of God.1 TIMOTHY 5
18 A
16
er all, Scripture says, "Never
muzzle an ox when it is threshing grain,"
and "The worker deserves his pay."
19 Don’t pay a en on to an accusa on
against a spiritual leader unless it is
supported by two or three witnesses.
20 Reprimand those leaders who sin. Do
it in front of everyone so that the other
leaders will also be afraid.
21 I solemnly call on you in the sight of
God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels
to be impar al when you follow what
I’ve told you. Never play favorites.
22 Don’t be in a hurry to place your
hands on anyone to ordain him. Don’t
par cipate in the sins of others. Keep
yourself morally pure.
23 Stop drinking only water. Instead,
drink a li le wine for your stomach
because you are frequently sick.1 TIMOTHY 5 – 6
17
24 The sins of some people are obvious,
going ahead of them to judgment. The
sins of others follow them there.
25 In the same way, the good things that
people do are obvious, and those that
aren’t obvious can’t remain hidden.
1 All slaves who believe must give
complete respect to their own
masters. In this way no one will speak
evil of God’s name and what we teach.
2 Slaves whose masters also believe
should respect their masters even
though their masters are also believers.
As a result, believers who are slaves
should serve their masters even be er
because those who receive the beneﬁt
of their work are believers whom they
love. Teach and encourage people to do
these things.
3 Whoever teaches false doctrine and
doesn’t agree with the accurate words of
our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teachings
61 TIMOTHY 6
18
4 is a conceited person. He shows that
he doesn’t understand anything. Rather,
he has an unhealthy desire to argue
and quarrel about words. This produces
jealousy, rivalry, cursing, suspicion,
5 and conﬂict between people whose
corrupt minds have been robbed of the
truth. They think that a godly life is a way
to make a proﬁt.
6 A godly life brings huge proﬁts to
people who are content with what they
have.
7 We didn’t bring anything into the
world, and we can’t take anything out of
it.
8 As long as we have food and clothes,
we should be sa sﬁed.
9 But people who want to get rich keep
falling into tempta on. They are trapped
by many stupid and harmful desires
which drown them in destruc on and
ruin.1 TIMOTHY 6
19
10 Certainly, the love of money is the
root of all kinds of evil. Some people
who have set their hearts on ge ng rich
have wandered away from the Chris an
faith and have caused themselves a lot
of grief.
11 But you, man of God, must avoid
these things. Pursue what God approves
of: a godly life, faith, love, endurance,
and gentleness.
12 Fight the good ﬁght for the Chris an
faith. Take hold of everlas ng life to
which you were called and about which
you made a good tes mony in front of
many witnesses.
13 In the sight of God, who gives life
to everything, and in the sight of Christ
Jesus, who gave a good tes mony in
front of Pon us Pilate,
14 I insist that, un l our Lord Jesus
Christ appears, you obey this command1 TIMOTHY 6
20
completely. Then you cannot be blamed
for doing anything wrong.
15 At the right me God will make this
known. God is the blessed and only ruler.
He is the King of kings and Lord of lords.
16 He is the only one who cannot die.
He lives in light that no one can come
near. No one has seen him, nor can they
see him. Honor and power belong to him
forever! Amen.
17 Tell those who have the riches of
this world not to be arrogant and not
to place their conﬁdence in anything as
uncertain as riches. Instead, they should
place their conﬁdence in God who richly
provides us with everything to enjoy.
18 Tell them to do good, to do a lot
of good things, to be generous, and to
share.
19 By doing this they store up a
treasure for themselves which is a good1 TIMOTHY 6
21
founda on for the future. In this way
they take hold of what life really is.
20 Timothy, guard the Good News
which has been entrusted to you. Turn
away from pointless discussions and the
claims of false knowledge that people
use to oppose the Chris an faith.
21 Although some claim to have
knowledge, they have abandoned the
faith. God’s good will be with all of you.2 Timothy
1
1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ
Jesus by God’s will––a will that
contains Christ Jesus’ promise of life.
2 To Timothy, my dear child. Good will,
mercy, and peace from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord!
3 I constantly remember you in my
prayers night and day when I thank God,
whom I serve with a clear conscience as
my ancestors did.
4 I remember your tears and want
to see you so that I can be ﬁlled with
happiness.
5 I’m reminded of how sincere your
faith is. That faith ﬁrst lived in your
grandmother Lois and your mother
Eunice. I’m convinced that it also lives in
you.2 TIMOTHY 1
6 You received a gi
2
from God when I
placed my hands on you to ordain you.
Now I’m reminding you to fan that gi
into ﬂames.
7 God didn’t give us a cowardly spirit
but a spirit of power, love, and good
judgment.
8 So never be ashamed to tell others
about our Lord or be ashamed of me, his
prisoner. Instead, by God’s power, join
me in suﬀering for the sake of the Good
News.
9 God saved us and called us to be holy,
not because of what we had done, but
because of his own plan and kindness.
Before the world began, God planned
that Christ Jesus would show us God’s
kindness.
10 Now with the coming of our Savior
Christ Jesus, he has revealed it. Christ
has destroyed death, and through the2 TIMOTHY 1
3
Good News he has brought eternal life
into full view.
11 I was appointed to be a messenger
of this Good News, an apostle, and a
teacher.
12 For this reason I suﬀer as I do.
However, I’m not ashamed. I know
whom I trust. I’m convinced that he is
able to protect what he had entrusted to
me un l that day.
13 With faith and love for Christ Jesus,
consider what you heard me say to be
the pa ern of accurate teachings.
14 With the help of the Holy Spirit who
lives in us, protect the Good News that
has been entrusted to you.
15 You know that everyone in the
province of Asia has deserted me,
including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
16 May the Lord be merciful to the
family of Onesiphorus. He o en took2 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
4
care of my needs and wasn’t ashamed
that I was a prisoner.
17 When he arrived in Rome, he
searched hard for me and found me.
18 May the Lord grant that Onesiphorus
ﬁnds mercy when that day comes. You
know very well that he did everything
possible to help me in Ephesus.
1 My child, ﬁnd your source of
strength in the kindness of Christ
Jesus.
2 You’ve heard my message, and it’s
been conﬁrmed by many witnesses.
Entrust this message to faithful
individuals who will be competent to
teach others.
3 Join me in suﬀering like a good soldier
of Christ Jesus.
4 Whoever serves in the military doesn’t
get mixed up in non–military ac vi es.
This pleases his commanding oﬃcer.
22 TIMOTHY 2
5 Whoever enters an athle
5
c
compe on wins the prize only
when playing by the rules.
6 A hard–working farmer should have
the ﬁrst share of the crops.
7 Understand what I’m saying. The Lord
will help you understand all these things.
8 Always think about Jesus Christ.
He was brought back to life and is a
descendant of David. This is the Good
News that I tell others.
9 I’m suﬀering disgrace for spreading
this Good News. I have even been put
into prison like a criminal. However,
God’s word is not imprisoned.
10 For that reason, I endure everything
for the sake of those who have been
chosen so that they, too, may receive
salva on from Christ Jesus with glory
that lasts forever.2 TIMOTHY 2
6
11 This is a statement that can be
trusted: If we have died with him, we
will live with him.
12 If we endure, we will rule with him. If
we disown him, he will disown us.
13 If we are unfaithful, he remains
faithful because he cannot be untrue to
himself.
14 Remind believers about these things,
and warn them in the sight of God not to
quarrel over words. Quarreling doesn’t
do any good but only destroys those
who are listening.
15 Do your best to present yourself to
God as a tried–and–true worker who
isn’t ashamed to teach the word of truth
correctly.
16 Avoid pointless discussions. People
who pay a en on to these pointless
discussions will become more ungodly,2 TIMOTHY 2
7
17 and what they say will spread like
cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like
that.
18 They have abandoned the truth.
They are destroying the faith of others
by saying that people who have died
have already come back to life.
19 In spite of all that, God’s people have
a solid founda on. These words are
engraved on it: "The Lord knows those
who belong to him," and "Whoever
worships the Lord must give up doing
wrong."
20 In a large house there are not only
objects made of gold and silver, but also
those made of wood and clay. Some
objects are honored when they are used;
others aren’t.
21 Those who stop associa ng with
dishonorable people will be honored.
They will be set apart for the master’s
use, prepared to do good things.2 TIMOTHY 2
8
22 Stay away from lusts which tempt
young people. Pursue what has God’s
approval. Pursue faith, love, and peace
together with those who worship the
Lord with a pure heart.
23 Don’t have anything to do with
foolish and stupid arguments. You know
they cause quarrels.
24 A servant of the Lord must not
quarrel. Instead, he must be kind to
everyone. He must be a good teacher.
He must be willing to suﬀer wrong.
25 He must be gentle in correc ng those
who oppose the Good News. Maybe God
will allow them to change the way they
think and act and lead them to know the
truth.
26 Then they might come back to their
senses and God will free them from the
devil’s snare so that they can do his will.2 TIMOTHY 3
3
9
1 You must understand this: In the
last days there will be violent periods
of me.
2 People will be selﬁsh and love money.
They will brag, be arrogant, and use
abusive language. They will curse their
parents, show no gra tude, have no
respect for what is holy,
3 and lack normal aﬀec on for their
families. They will refuse to make peace
with anyone. They will be slanderous,
lack self–control, be brutal, and have no
love for what is good.
4 They will be traitors. They will be
reckless and conceited. They will love
pleasure rather than God.
5 They will appear to have a godly life,
but they will not let its power change
them. Stay away from such people.
6 Some of these men go into homes and
mislead weak–minded women who are2 TIMOTHY 3
10
burdened with sins and led by all kinds
of desires.
7 These women are always studying but
are never able to recognize the truth.
8 As Jannes and Jambres opposed
Moses, so these men oppose the truth.
Their minds are corrupt, and the faith
they teach is counterfeit.
9 Certainly, they won’t get very far. Like
the stupidity of Jannes and Jambres,
their stupidity will be plain to everyone.
10 But you know all about my teachings,
my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my
pa ence, my love, and my endurance.
11 You also know about the kind of
persecu ons and suﬀerings which
happened to me in the ci es of An och,
Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those
persecu ons, and the Lord rescued me
from all of them.2 TIMOTHY 3
11
12 Those who try to live a godly life
because they believe in Christ Jesus will
be persecuted.
13 But evil people and phony preachers
will go from bad to worse as they mislead
people and are themselves misled.
14 However, con nue in what you have
learned and found to be true. You know
who your teachers were.
15 From infancy you have known the
Holy Scriptures. They have the power
to give you wisdom so that you can be
saved through faith in Christ Jesus.
16 Every Scripture passage is inspired by
God. All of them are useful for teaching,
poin ng out errors, correc ng people,
and training them for a life that has
God’s approval.
17 They equip God’s servants so that
they are completely prepared to do good
things.2 TIMOTHY 4
4
12
1 I solemnly call on you in the
presence of God and Christ Jesus,
who is going to judge those who are
living and those who are dead. I do this
because Christ Jesus will come to rule
the world.
2 Be ready to spread the word whether
or not the me is right. Point out errors,
warn people, and encourage them. Be
very pa ent when you teach.
3 A me will come when people will
not listen to accurate teachings. Instead,
they will follow their own desires and
surround themselves with teachers who
tell them what they want to hear.
4 People will refuse to listen to the truth
and turn to myths.
5 But you must keep a clear head in
everything. Endure suﬀering. Do the
work of a missionary. Devote yourself
completely to your work.2 TIMOTHY 4
13
6 My life is coming to an end, and it is
now me for me to be poured out as a
sacriﬁce to God.
7 I have fought the good ﬁght. I have
completed the race. I have kept the faith.
8 The prize that shows I have God’s
approval is now wai ng for me. The
Lord, who is a fair judge, will give me
that prize on that day. He will give it not
only to me but also to everyone who is
eagerly wai ng for him to come again.
9 Hurry to visit me soon.
10 Demas has abandoned me. He fell in
love with this present world and went to
the city of Thessalonica. Crescens went
to the province of Gala a, and Titus
went to the province of Dalma a.
11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and
bring him with you. He is useful to me in
my work.
12 I’m sending Tychicus to the city of
Ephesus as my representa ve.2 TIMOTHY 4
14
13 When you come, bring the warm
coat I le with Carpus in the city of Troas.
Also bring the scrolls and especially the
parchments.
14 Alexander the metalworker did me a
great deal of harm. The Lord will pay him
back for what he did.
15 Watch out for him. He violently
opposed what we said.
16 At my ﬁrst hearing no one stood up
in my defense. Everyone abandoned me.
I pray that it won’t be held against them.
17 However, the Lord stood by me and
gave me strength so that I could ﬁnish
spreading the Good News for all the
na ons to hear. I was snatched out of a
lion’s mouth.
18 The Lord will rescue me from all harm
and will take me safely to his heavenly
kingdom. Glory belongs to him forever!
Amen.2 TIMOTHY 4
19 Give my gree
15
ngs to Prisca and
Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.
20 Erastus stayed in the city of Corinth
and I le Trophimus in the city of Miletus
because he was sick.
21 Hurry to visit me before winter
comes. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia
and all the brothers and sisters send you
gree ngs.
22 The Lord be with you. His good will
be with all of you.Titus

1 From Paul, a servant of God and an
apostle of Jesus Christ. I was sent to
lead God’s chosen people to faith and to
the knowledge of the truth that leads to
a godly life.
2 My message is based on the
conﬁdence of eternal life. God, who
never lies, promised this eternal life
before the world began.
3 God has revealed this in every era by
spreading his word. I was entrusted with
this word by the command of God our
Savior.
4 To Titus, a genuine child in the faith
we share. Good will and peace from God
the Father and from Christ Jesus our
Savior are yours!TITUS 1
5 I le
2
you in Crete to do what s ll
needed to be done––appoin ng spiritual
leaders in every city as I directed you.
6 A spiritual leader must have a good
reputa on. He must have only one wife
and have children who are believers. His
children shouldn’t be known for having
wild lifestyles or being rebellious.
7 Because a bishop is a supervisor
appointed by God, he must have a good
reputa on. He must not be a stubborn
or irritable person. He must not drink
too much or be a violent person. He
must not use shameful ways to make
money.
8 Instead, he must be hospitable, love
what is good, use good judgment, be fair
and moral, and have self–control.
9 He must be devoted to the trustworthy
message we teach. Then he can use
these accurate teachings to encourageTITUS 1
3
people and correct those who oppose
the word.
10 There are many believers, especially
converts from Judaism, who are
rebellious. They speak nonsense and
deceive people.
11 They must be silenced because they
are ruining whole families by teaching
what they shouldn’t teach. This is the
shameful way they make money.
12 Even one of their own prophets
said, "Cretans are always liars, savage
animals, and lazy glu ons."
13 That statement is true. For this
reason, sharply correct believers so that
they con nue to have faith that is alive
and well.
14 They shouldn’t pay a en on to
Jewish myths or commands given by
people who are always rejec ng the
truth.TITUS 1 – 2
4
15 Everything is clean to those who are
clean. But nothing is clean to corrupt
unbelievers. Indeed, their minds and
their consciences are corrupted.
16 They claim to know God, but they
deny him by what they do. They are
detestable, disobedient, and unﬁt to do
anything good.
1 Tell believers to live the kind of
life that goes along with accurate
teachings.
2 Tell older men to be sober. Tell them
to be men of good character, to use good
judgment, and to be well–grounded in
faith, love, and endurance.
3 Tell older women to live their lives in
a way that shows they are dedicated
to God. Tell them not to be gossips or
addicted to alcohol, but to be examples
of virtue.
2TITUS 2
5
4 In this way they will teach young
women to show love to their husbands
and children,
5 to use good judgment, and to be
morally pure. Also, tell them to teach
young women to be homemakers, to
be kind, and to place themselves under
their husbands’ authority. Then no one
can speak evil of God’s word.
6 Encourage young men to use good
judgment.
7 Always set an example by doing good
things. When you teach, be an example
of moral purity and dignity.
8 Speak an accurate message that
cannot be condemned. Then those who
oppose us will be ashamed because they
cannot say anything bad about us.
9 Tell slaves who are believers to
place themselves under their masters’
authority in everything they do. TellTITUS 2
6
them to please their masters, not to
argue with them
10 or steal from them. Instead, tell
slaves to show their masters how
good and completely loyal they can
be. Then they will show the beauty of
the teachings about God our Savior in
everything they do.
11 A er all, God’s saving kindness has
appeared for the beneﬁt of all people.
12 It trains us to avoid ungodly lives
ﬁlled with worldly desires so that we can
live self–controlled, moral, and godly
lives in this present world.
13 At the same me we can expect what
we hope for––the appearance of the
glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus
Christ.
14 He gave himself for us to set us free
from every sin and to cleanse us so that
we can be his special people who are
enthusias c about doing good things.TITUS 2 – 3
7
15 Tell these things to the believers.
Encourage and correct them, using your
full authority. Don’t let anyone ignore
you.
1 Remind believers to willingly place
themselves under the authority of
government oﬃcials. Believers should
obey them and be ready to help them
with every good thing they do.
2 Believers shouldn’t curse anyone or
be quarrelsome, but they should be
gentle and show courtesy to everyone.
3 Indeed, we, too, were once stupid,
disobedient, and misled. We were slaves
to many kinds of lusts and pleasures. We
were mean and jealous. We were hated,
and we hated each other.
4 However, when God our Savior made
his kindness and love for humanity
appear,
5 he saved us, but not because of
anything we had done to gain his
3TITUS 3
8
approval. Instead, because of his mercy
he saved us through the washing in
which the Holy Spirit gives us new birth
and renewal.
6 God poured a generous amount of
the Spirit on us through Jesus Christ our
Savior.
7 As a result, God in his kindness has
given us his approval and we have
become heirs who have the conﬁdence
that we have everlas ng life.
8 This is a statement that can be trusted.
I want you to insist on these things
so that those who believe in God can
concentrate on se ng an example by
doing good things. This is good and helps
other people.
9 Avoid foolish controversies,
arguments about genealogies, quarrels,
and ﬁghts about Moses’ Teachings. This
is useless and worthless.TITUS 3
9
10 Have nothing to do with people who
con nue to teach false doctrine a er
you have warned them once or twice.
11 You know that people like this are
corrupt. They are sinners condemned by
their own ac ons.
12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus
to you, hurry to visit me in the city of
Nicopolis. I have decided to spend the
winter there.
13 Give Zenas the lawyer and Apollos
your best support for their trip so that
they will have everything they need.
14 Our people should also learn how
to set an example by doing good things
when urgent needs arise so that they
can live produc ve lives.
15 Everyone with me sends you
gree ngs. Greet our faithful friends.
God’s good will be with all of you.Philemon
1
1 From Paul, who is a prisoner
for Christ Jesus, and our brother
Timothy. To our dear coworker Philemon,
2 our sister Apphia, our fellow soldier
Archippus, and the church that meets in
your house.
3 Good will and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are
yours!
4 Philemon, I always thank my God
when I men on you in my prayers
because
5 I hear about your faithfulness to the
Lord Jesus and your love for all of God’s
people.
6 As you share the faith you have in
common with others, I pray that you mayPHILEMON 1
2
come to have a complete knowledge of
every blessing we have in Christ.
7 Your love for God’s people gives me
a lot of joy and encouragement. You,
brother, have comforted God’s people.
8 Christ makes me bold enough to order
you to do the right thing.
9 However, I would prefer to make an
appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an
old man and now a prisoner for Christ
Jesus,
10 appeal to you for my child Onesimus
[Useful]. I became his spiritual father
here in prison.
11 Once he was useless to you, but now
he is very useful to both of us.
12 I am sending him back to you. This is
like sending you a part of myself.
13 I wanted to keep him here with me.
Then he could have served me in your
place while I am in prison for spreading
the Good News.PHILEMON 1
3
14 Yet, I didn’t want to do anything
without your consent. I want you to do
this favor for me out of your own free
will without feeling forced to do it.
15 Maybe Onesimus was gone for a
while so that you could have him back
forever––
16 no longer as a slave but be er than a
slave––as a dear brother. He is especially
dear to me, but even more so to you,
both as a person and as a Chris an.
17 If you think of me as your partner,
welcome him as you would welcome
me.
18 If he wronged you in any way or owes
you anything, charge it to me.
19 I, Paul, promise to pay it back. I’m
wri ng this with my own hand. I won’t
even men on that you owe me your life.
20 So, because we’re brothers in the
Lord, do something for me. Give me
some comfort because of Christ.PHILEMON 1
4
21 I am conﬁdent as I write to you that
you will do this. And I know that you will
do even more than I ask.
22 One more thing––have a guest room
ready for me. I hope that, because of
your prayers, God will give me back to
you.
23 Epaphras, who is a prisoner because
of Christ Jesus like I am,
24 and my coworkers Mark, Aristarchus,
Demas, and Luke send you gree ngs.
25 The good will of our Lord Jesus Christ
be yours.Hebrews
1
1 In the past God spoke to our
ancestors at many diﬀerent mes
and in many diﬀerent ways through the
prophets.
2 In these last days he has spoken to
us through his Son. God made his Son
responsible for everything. His Son is
the one through whom God made the
universe.
3 His Son is the reﬂec on of God’s glory
and the exact likeness of God’s being. He
holds everything together through his
powerful words. A er he had cleansed
people from their sins, he received the
highest posi on, the one next to the
Father in heaven.HEBREWS 1
2
4 The Son has become greater than the
angels since he has been given a name
that is superior to theirs.
5 God never said to any of his angels,
"You are my Son. Today I have become
your Father." And God never said to any
of his angels, "I will be his Father, and he
will be my Son."
6 When God was about to send his
ﬁrstborn Son into the world, he said, "All
of God’s angels must worship him."
7 God said about the angels, "He makes
his messengers winds. He makes his
servants ﬂames of ﬁre."
8 But God said about his Son, "Your
throne, O God, is forever and ever. The
scepter in your kingdom is a scepter for
jus ce.
9 You have loved what is right and hated
what is wrong. That is why God, your
God, anointed you, rather than your
companions, with the oil of joy."HEBREWS 1 – 2
3
10 God also said, "Lord, in the beginning
you laid the founda on of the earth.
With your own hands you made the
heavens.
11 They will come to an end, but you
will live forever. They will all wear out
like clothes.
12 They will be taken oﬀ like a coat. You
will change them like clothes. But you
remain the same, and your life will never
end.
13 But God never said to any of the
angels, "Sit in the highest posi on in
heaven un l I make your enemies your
footstool."
14 What are all the angels? They are
spirits sent to serve those who are going
to receive salva on.
1 For this reason we must pay closer
a en on to what we have heard.
Then we won’t dri away from the truth.
2HEBREWS 2
2A
4
er all, the message that the angels
brought was reliable, and every viola on
and act of disobedience was properly
punished.
3 So how will we escape punishment
if we reject the important message,
the message that God saved us? First,
the Lord told this saving message. Then
those who heard him conﬁrmed that
message.
4 God veriﬁed what they said through
miraculous signs, amazing things, other
powerful acts, and with other gi s from
the Holy Spirit as he wanted.
5 He didn’t put the world that will come
(about which we are talking) under the
angels’ control.
6 Instead, someone has declared this
somewhere in Scripture: "What is a
mortal that you should remember him,
or the Son of Man that you take care of
him?HEBREWS 2
7 You made him a li
5
le lower than the
angels. You crowned him with glory and
honor.
8 You put everything under his control."
When God put everything under his
Son’s control, nothing was le out.
However, at the present me we s ll
don’t see everything under his Son’s
control.
9 Jesus was made a li le lower than the
angels, but we see him crowned with
glory and honor because he suﬀered
death. Through God’s kindness he died
on behalf of everyone.
10 God is the one for whom and through
whom everything exists. Therefore,
while God was bringing many sons
and daughters to glory, it was the right
me to bring Jesus, the source of their
salva on, to the end of his work through
suﬀering.HEBREWS 2
6
11 Jesus, who makes people holy, and all
those who are made holy have the same
Father. That is why Jesus isn’t ashamed
to call them brothers and sisters.
12 He says, "I will tell my people about
your name. I will praise you within the
congrega on."
13 In addi on, Jesus says, "I will trust
him." And Jesus says, "I am here with the
sons and daughters God has given me."
14 Since all of these sons and daughters
have ﬂesh and blood, Jesus took on ﬂesh
and blood to be like them. He did this so
that by dying he would destroy the one
who had power over death (that is, the
devil).
15 In this way he would free those who
were slaves all their lives because they
were afraid of dying.
16 So Jesus helps Abraham’s
descendants rather than helping
angels.HEBREWS 2 – 3
7
17 Therefore, he had to become like his
brothers and sisters so that he could be
merciful. He became like them so that
he could serve as a faithful chief priest
in God’s presence and make peace with
God for their sins.
18 Because Jesus experienced
tempta on when he suﬀered, he is able
to help others when they are tempted.
1 Brothers and sisters, you are holy
partners in a heavenly calling. So
look carefully at Jesus, the apostle and
chief priest about whom we make our
declara on of faith.
2 Jesus is faithful to God, who appointed
him, in the same way that Moses was
faithful when he served in God’s house.
3 Jesus deserves more praise than
Moses in the same way that the builder
of a house is praised more than the
house.
3HEBREWS 3
4A
8
er all, every house has a builder,
but the builder of everything is God.
5 Moses was a faithful servant in God’s
household. He told the people what God
would say in the future.
6 But Christ is a faithful son in charge of
God’s household. We are his household
if we con nue to have courage and to be
proud of the conﬁdence we have.
7 As the Holy Spirit says, "If you hear
God speak today, don’t be stubborn.
8 Don’t be stubborn like those who
rebelled and tested me in the desert.
9 That is where your ancestors tested
me,
10 although they had seen what I had
done for 40 years. That is why I was
angry with those people. So I said, ‘Their
hearts con nue to stray, and they have
not learned my ways.’HEBREWS 3
9
11 So I angrily took a solemn oath that
they would never enter my place of
rest."
12 Be careful, brothers and sisters, that
none of you ever develop a wicked,
unbelieving heart that turns away from
the living God.
13 Encourage each other every day
while you have the opportunity. If you
do this, none of you will be deceived by
sin and become stubborn.
14 A er all, we will remain Christ’s
partners only if we con nue to hold on
to our original conﬁdence un l the end.
15 Scripture says, "If you hear God
speak today, don’t be stubborn. Don’t
be stubborn like those who rebelled."
16 Who heard God and rebelled? All
those whom Moses led out of Egypt
rebelled.HEBREWS 3 – 4
10
17 With whom was God angry for 40
years? He was angry with those who
sinned and died in the desert.
18 Who did God swear would never
enter his place of rest? He was talking
about those who didn’t obey him.
19 So we see that they couldn’t enter his
place of rest because they didn’t believe.
1 God’s promise that we may enter
his place of rest s ll stands. We are
afraid that some of you think you won’t
enter his place of rest.
2 We have heard the same Good News
that your ancestors heard. But the
message didn’t help those who heard it
in the past because they didn’t believe.
3 We who believe are entering that
place of rest. As God said, "So I angrily
took a solemn oath that they would
never enter my place of rest." God said
this even though he had ﬁnished his
work when he created the world.
4HEBREWS 4
11
4 Somewhere in Scripture God has said
this about the seventh day: "On the
seventh day God rested from all his
work."
5 God also said in the same passage,
"They will never enter my place of rest."
6 However, some people enter that
place of rest. Those who heard the Good
News in the past did not enter God’s
place of rest because they did not obey
God.
7 So God set another day. That day is
today. Many years a er your ancestors
failed to enter that place of rest God
spoke about it through David in the
passage already quoted: "If you hear
God speak today, don’t be stubborn."
8 If Joshua had given the people rest,
God would not have spoken about
another day.
9 Therefore, a me of rest and worship
exists for God’s people.HEBREWS 4
12
10 Those who entered his place of rest
also rested from their work as God did
from his.
11 So we must make every eﬀort to
enter that place of rest. Then no one
will be lost by following the example of
those who refused to obey.
12 God’s word is living and ac ve. It is
sharper than any two–edged sword and
cuts as deep as the place where soul
and spirit meet, the place where joints
and marrow meet. God’s word judges a
person’s thoughts and inten ons.
13 No creature can hide from God.
Everything is uncovered and exposed for
him to see. We must answer to him.
14 We need to hold on to our declara on
of faith: We have a superior chief priest
who has gone through the heavens. That
person is Jesus, the Son of God.
15 We have a chief priest who is able
to sympathize with our weaknesses. HeHEBREWS 4 – 5
13
was tempted in every way that we are,
but he didn’t sin.
16 So we can go conﬁdently to the
throne of God’s kindness to receive
mercy and ﬁnd kindness, which will help
us at the right me.
1 Every chief priest is chosen from
humans to represent them in front of
God, that is, to oﬀer gi s and sacriﬁces
for sin.
2 The chief priest can be gentle
with people who are ignorant and
easily deceived, because he also has
weaknesses.
3 Because he has weaknesses, he has
to oﬀer sacriﬁces for his own sins in the
same way that he does for the sins of his
people.
4 No one takes this honor for himself.
Instead, God calls him as he called
Aaron.
5HEBREWS 5
14
5 So Christ did not take the glory of
being a chief priest for himself. Instead,
the glory was given to him by God, who
said, "You are my Son. Today I have
become your Father."
6 In another place in Scripture, God
said, "You are a priest forever, in the way
Melchizedek was a priest."
7 During his life on earth, Jesus prayed
to God, who could save him from death.
He prayed and pleaded with loud crying
and tears, and he was heard because of
his devo on to God.
8 Although Jesus was the Son of God,
he learned to be obedient through his
suﬀerings.
9 A er he had ﬁnished his work, he
became the source of eternal salva on
for everyone who obeys him.
10 God appointed him chief priest in the
way Melchizedek was a priest.HEBREWS 5 – 6
15
11 We have a lot to explain about this.
But since you have become too lazy
to pay a en on, explaining it to you is
hard.
12 By now you should be teachers.
Instead, you s ll need someone to teach
you the elementary truths of God’s
word. You need milk, not solid food.
13 All those who live on milk lack the
experience to talk about what is right.
They are s ll babies.
14 However, solid food is for mature
people, whose minds are trained by
prac ce to know the diﬀerence between
good and evil.
1 With this in mind, we should stop
going over the elementary truths
about Christ and move on to topics
for more mature people. We shouldn’t
repeat the basics about turning away
from the useless things we did and the
basics about faith in God.
6HEBREWS 6
16
2 We shouldn’t repeat the basic
teachings about such things as bap sms,
se ng people apart for holy tasks, dead
people coming back to life, and eternal
judgment.
3 If God permits, we will do this.
4 Some people once had God’s light.
They experienced the heavenly gi and
shared in the Holy Spirit.
5 They experienced the goodness of
God’s word and the powers of the world
to come.
6 Yet, they have deserted Christ. They
are crucifying the Son of God again and
publicly disgracing him. Therefore, they
cannot be led a second me to God.
7 God blesses the earth. So rain o en
falls on it, and it produces useful crops
for farmers.
8 However, if the earth produces thorns
and thistles, it is worthless and in dangerHEBREWS 6
17
of being cursed. In the end it will be
burned.
9 Dear friends, even though we say
these things, we are s ll convinced that
be er things are in store for you and
that they will save you.
10 God is fair. He won’t forget what
you’ve done or the love you’ve shown
for him. You helped his holy people, and
you con nue to help them.
11 We want each of you to prove that
you’re working hard so that you will
remain conﬁdent un l the end.
12 Then, instead of being lazy, you will
imitate those who are receiving the
promises through faith and pa ence.
13 God made a promise to Abraham.
Since he had no one greater on whom to
base his oath, he based it on himself.
14 He said, "I will certainly bless you and
give you many descendants."HEBREWS 6
18
15 So Abraham received what God
promised because he waited pa ently
for it.
16 When people take oaths, they base
their oaths on someone greater than
themselves. Their oaths guarantee what
they say and end all arguments.
17 God wouldn’t change his plan. He
wanted to make this perfectly clear to
those who would receive his promise, so
he took an oath.
18 God did this so that we would be
encouraged. God cannot lie when he
takes an oath or makes a promise. These
two things can never be changed. Those
of us who have taken refuge in him hold
on to the conﬁdence we have been
given.
19 We have this conﬁdence as a sure
and strong anchor for our lives. This
conﬁdence goes into the holy place
behind the curtainHEBREWS 6 – 7
19
20 where Jesus went before us on our
behalf. He has become the chief priest
forever in the way Melchizedek was a
priest.
1 Melchizedek was king of Salem
and priest of the Most High God. He
met Abraham and blessed him when
Abraham was returning from defea ng
the kings.
2 Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of
everything he had captured. In the ﬁrst
place, Melchizedek’s name means king
of righteousness. He is also called king of
Salem (which means king of peace).
3 No one knows anything about
Melchizedek’s father, mother, or
ancestors. No one knows when he was
born or when he died. Like the Son of
God, Melchizedek con nues to be a
priest forever.
4 You can see how important
Melchizedek was. Abraham gave him
7HEBREWS 7
20
a tenth of what he had captured, even
though Abraham was the father of the
chosen people.
5 Moses’ Teachings say that members
of the tribe of Levi who become priests
must receive a tenth of everything
from the people. The priests collect
it from their own people, Abraham’s
descendants.
6 Although Melchizedek was not from
the tribe of Levi, he received a tenth
of everything from Abraham. Then
Melchizedek blessed Abraham, who had
God’s promises.
7 No one can deny that the more
important person blesses the less
important person.
8 Priests receive a tenth of everything,
but they die. Melchizedek received a
tenth of everything, but we are told that
he lives.HEBREWS 7
21
9 We could even say that when
Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of
everything, Levi was giving a tenth of
everything. Levi gave, although later his
descendants would receive a tenth of
everything.
10 Even though Levi had not yet been
born, he was in the body of Abraham
when Melchizedek met him.
11 The people established the Levi cal
priesthood based on instruc ons they
received. If the work of the Levi cal
priests had been perfect, we wouldn’t
need to speak about another kind of
priest. However, we speak about another
kind of priest, a priest like Melchizedek,
not a Levi cal priest like Aaron.
12 When a diﬀerent kind of priesthood
is established, the regula ons for those
priests are diﬀerent.
13 The priest whom we are talking
about was a member of a diﬀerent tribe.HEBREWS 7
22
No one from that tribe ever served as a
priest at the altar.
14 Everyone knows that our Lord came
from the tribe of Judah. Moses never
said anything about priests coming from
that tribe.
15 The regula ons were diﬀerent. This
became clear when a diﬀerent priest
who is like Melchizedek appeared.
16 That person is a priest, not because
he met human requirements, but
because he has power that comes from
a life that cannot be destroyed.
17 The Scriptures say the following
about him: "You are a priest forever, in
the way Melchizedek was a priest."
18 The former requirements are
rejected because they are weak and
useless.
19 Moses’ Teachings couldn’t
accomplish everything that God
required. But we have something elseHEBREWS 7
23
that gives us greater conﬁdence and
allows us to approach God.
20 None of this happened without an
oath. The men from the tribe of Levi may
have become priests without an oath,
21 but Jesus became a priest when
God took an oath. God said about him,
"The Lord has taken an oath and will
not change his mind. You are a priest
forever."
22 In this way Jesus has become the
guarantee of a be er promise.
23 There was a long succession of
priests because when a priest died he
could no longer serve.
24 But Jesus lives forever, so he serves
as a priest forever.
25 That is why he is always able to save
those who come to God through him. He
can do this because he always lives and
intercedes for them.HEBREWS 7 – 8
24
26 We need a chief priest who is holy,
innocent, pure, set apart from sinners,
and who has the highest posi on in
heaven.
27 We need a priest who doesn’t have
to bring daily sacriﬁces as those chief
priests did. First they brought sacriﬁces
for their own sins, and then they brought
sacriﬁces for the sins of the people.
Jesus brought the sacriﬁce for the sins
of the people once and for all when he
sacriﬁced himself.
28 Moses’ Teachings designated mortals
as chief priests even though they had
weaknesses. But God’s promise, which
came a er Moses’ Teachings, designated
the Son who forever accomplished
everything that God required.
1 The main point we want to make
is this: We do have this kind of chief
priest. This chief priest has received the
8HEBREWS 8
25
highest posi on, the throne of majesty
in heaven.
2 He serves as priest of the holy place
and of the true tent set up by the Lord
and not by any human.
3 Every chief priest is appointed to oﬀer
gi s and sacriﬁces. Therefore, this chief
priest had to oﬀer something.
4 If he were on earth, he would not
even be a priest. On earth other priests
oﬀer gi s by following the instruc ons
that Moses gave.
5 They serve at a place that is a pa ern,
a shadow, of what is in heaven. When
Moses was about to make the tent,
God warned him, "Be sure to make
everything based on the plan I showed
you on the mountain."
6 Jesus has been given a priestly work
that is superior to the Levi cal priests’
work. He also brings a be er promiseHEBREWS 8
26
from God that is based on be er
guarantees.
7 If nothing had been wrong with the
ﬁrst promise, no one would look for
another one.
8 But God found something wrong with
his people and said to them, "The days
are coming, says the Lord, when I will
make a new promise to Israel and Judah.
9 It will not be like the promise that I
made to their ancestors when I took
them by the hand and brought them out
of Egypt. They rejected that promise, so
I ignored them, says the Lord.
10 But this is the promise that I will
make to Israel a er those days, says the
Lord: I will put my teachings inside them,
and I will write those teachings on their
hearts. I will be their God, and they will
be my people.
11 No longer will each person teach
his neighbors or his rela ves by saying,HEBREWS 8 – 9
27
‘Know the Lord.’ All of them from the
least important to the most important
will all know me
12 because I will forgive their
wickedness and I will no longer hold
their sins against them."
13 God made this new promise and
showed that the ﬁrst promise was
outdated. What is outdated and aging
will soon disappear.
1 The ﬁrst promise had rules for the
priests’ service. It also had a holy
place on earth.
2 A tent was set up. The ﬁrst part of this
tent was called the holy place. The lamp
stand, the table, and the bread of the
presence were in this part of the tent.
3 Behind the second curtain was the
part of the tent called the most holy
place.
4 It contained the gold incense burner
and the ark of the Lord’s promise.
9HEBREWS 9
28
The ark was completely covered with
gold. In the ark were the gold jar ﬁlled
with manna, Aaron’s staﬀ that had
blossomed, and the tablets on which the
promise was wri en.
5 Above the ark were the angels of
glory with their wings overshadowing
the throne of mercy. (Discussing these
things in detail isn’t possible now.)
6 That is how these two parts of the
tent were set up. The priests always
went into the ﬁrst part of the tent to
perform their du es.
7 But only the chief priest went into
the second part of the tent. Once a
year he entered and brought blood
that he oﬀered for himself and for
the things that the people did wrong
uninten onally.
8 The Holy Spirit used this to show that
the way into the most holy place was not
open while the tent was s ll in use.HEBREWS 9
29
9 The ﬁrst part of the tent is an example
for the present me. The gi s and
sacriﬁces that were brought there
could not give the worshiper a clear
conscience.
10 These gi s and sacriﬁces were meant
to be food, drink, and items used in
various puriﬁca on ceremonies. These
ceremonies were required for the body
un l God would establish a new way of
doing things.
11 But Christ came as a chief priest of
the good things that are now here. Christ
went through a be er, more perfect tent
that was not made by human hands and
that is not part of this created world.
12 He used his own blood, not the blood
of goats and bulls, for the sacriﬁce.
He went into the most holy place and
oﬀered this sacriﬁce once and for all to
free us forever.HEBREWS 9
30
13 The blood of goats and bulls and
the ashes of cows sprinkled on unclean
people made their bodies holy and
clean.
14 The blood of Christ, who had no
defect, does even more. Through the
eternal Spirit he oﬀered himself to God
and cleansed our consciences from the
useless things we had done. Now we can
serve the living God.
15 Because Christ oﬀered himself to
God, he is able to bring a new promise
from God. Through his death he paid the
price to set people free from the sins
they commi ed under the ﬁrst promise.
He did this so that those who are called
can be guaranteed an inheritance that
will last forever.
16 In order for a will to take eﬀect, it
must be shown that the one who made
it has died.HEBREWS 9
17 A will is used only a
31
er a person is
dead because it goes into eﬀect only
when a person dies.
18 That is why even the ﬁrst promise
was made with blood.
19 As Moses’ Teachings tell us, Moses
told all the people every commandment.
Then he took the blood of calves and
goats together with some water, red
yarn, and hyssop and sprinkled the scroll
and all the people.
20 He said, "Here is the blood that seals
the promise God has made to you."
21 In the same way, Moses sprinkled
blood on the tent and on everything
used in worship.
22 As Moses’ Teachings tell us, blood
was used to cleanse almost everything,
because if no blood is shed, no sins can
be forgiven.
23 The copies of the things in heaven
had to be cleansed by these sacriﬁces.HEBREWS 9
32
But the heavenly things themselves had
to be cleansed by be er sacriﬁces.
24 Christ didn’t go into a holy place
made by human hands. He didn’t go
into a model of the real thing. Instead,
he went into heaven to appear in God’s
presence on our behalf.
25 Every year the chief priest went into
the holy place to make a sacriﬁce with
blood that isn’t his own. However, Christ
didn’t go into heaven to sacriﬁce himself
again and again.
26 Otherwise, he would have had to
suﬀer many mes since the world was
created. But now, at the end of the ages,
he has appeared once to remove sin by
his sacriﬁce.
27 People die once, and a er that they
are judged.
28 Likewise, Christ was sacriﬁced once
to take away the sins of humanity, and
a er that he will appear a second me.HEBREWS 10
33
This me he will not deal with sin, but he
will save those who eagerly wait for him.
1 Moses’ Teachings with their
yearly cycle of sacriﬁces are only
a shadow of the good things in the
future. They aren’t an exact likeness of
those things. They can never make those
who worship perfect.
2 If these sacriﬁces could have made
the worshipers perfect, the sacriﬁces
would have stopped long ago. Those
who worship would have been cleansed
once and for all. Their consciences would
have been free from sin.
3 Instead, this yearly cycle of sacriﬁces
reminded people of their sins.
4 (The blood of bulls and goats cannot
take away sins.)
5 For this reason, when Christ came
into the world, he said, "’You did not
want sacriﬁces and oﬀerings, but you
prepared a body for me.
10HEBREWS 10
34
6 You did not approve of burnt oﬀerings
and sacriﬁces for sin.’
7 Then I said, ‘I have come! (It is wri en
about me in the scroll of the book.) I
have come to do what you want, my
God.’"
8 In this passage Christ ﬁrst said, "You
did not want sacriﬁces, oﬀerings, burnt
oﬀerings, and sacriﬁces for sin. You did
not approve of them." (These are the
sacriﬁces that Moses’ Teachings require
people to oﬀer.)
9 Then Christ says, "I have come to
do what you want." He did away with
sacriﬁces in order to establish the
obedience that God wants.
10 We have been set apart as holy
because Jesus Christ did what God
wanted him to do by sacriﬁcing his body
once and for all.
11 Every day each priest performed his
religious duty. He oﬀered the same typeHEBREWS 10
35
of sacriﬁce again and again. Yet, these
sacriﬁces could never take away sins.
12 However, this chief priest made one
sacriﬁce for sins, and this sacriﬁce lasts
forever. Then he received the highest
posi on in heaven.
13 Since that me, he has been wai ng
for his enemies to be made his footstool.
14 With one sacriﬁce he accomplished
the work of se ng them apart for God
forever.
15 The Holy Spirit tells us the same
thing:
16 "This is the promise that I will make
to them a er those days, says the Lord:
‘I will put my teachings in their hearts
and write them in their minds.’"
17 Then he adds, "I will no longer hold
their sins and their disobedience against
them."
18 When sins are forgiven, there is no
longer any need to sacriﬁce for sins.HEBREWS 10
36
19 Brothers and sisters, because of the
blood of Jesus we can now conﬁdently
go into the holy place.
20 Jesus has opened a new and living
way for us to go through the curtain.
(The curtain is his own body.)
21 We have a superior priest in charge
of God’s house.
22 We have been sprinkled with his
blood to free us from a guilty conscience,
and our bodies have been washed with
clean water. So we must con nue to
come to him with a sincere heart and
strong faith.
23 We must con nue to hold ﬁrmly to
our declara on of faith. The one who
made the promise is faithful.
24 We must also consider how to
encourage each other to show love and
to do good things.
25 We should not stop gathering
together with other believers, as someHEBREWS 10
37
of you are doing. Instead, we must
con nue to encourage each other even
more as we see the day of the Lord
coming.
26 If we go on sinning a er we have
learned the truth, no sacriﬁce can take
away our sins.
27 All that is le is a terrifying wait for
judgment and a raging ﬁre that will
consume God’s enemies.
28 If two or three witnesses accused
someone of rejec ng Moses’ Teachings,
that person was shown no mercy as he
was executed.
29 What do you think a person who
shows no respect for the Son of God
deserves? That person looks at the blood
of the promise (the blood that made him
holy) as no diﬀerent from other people’s
blood, and he insults the Spirit that God
gave us out of his kindness. He deserves
a much worse punishment.HEBREWS 10
38
30 We know the God who said, "I alone
have the right to take revenge. I will
pay back." God also said, "The Lord will
judge his people."
31 Falling into the hands of the living
God is a terrifying thing.
32 Remember the past, when you ﬁrst
learned the truth. You endured a lot of
hardship and pain.
33 At mes you were publicly insulted
and mistreated. At mes you associated
with people who were treated this way.
34 You suﬀered with prisoners. You were
cheerful even though your possessions
were stolen, since you know that you
have a be er and more permanent
possession.
35 So don’t lose your conﬁdence. It will
bring you a great reward.
36 You need endurance so that a er you
have done what God wants you to do,
you can receive what he has promised.HEBREWS 10 – 11
39
37 "Yet, the one who is coming will
come soon. He will not delay.
38 The person who has God’s approval
will live by faith. But if he turns back, I
will not be pleased with him."
39 We don’t belong with those who
turn back and are destroyed. Instead, we
belong with those who have faith and
are saved.
1 Faith assures us of things we
expect and convinces us of the
existence of things we cannot see.
2 God accepted our ancestors because
of their faith.
3 Faith convinces us that God created
the world through his word. This
means what can be seen was made by
something that could not be seen.
4 Faith led Abel to oﬀer God a be er
sacriﬁce than Cain’s sacriﬁce. Through
his faith Abel received God’s approval,
since God accepted his sacriﬁces.
11HEBREWS 11
40
Through his faith Abel s ll speaks, even
though he is dead.
5 Faith enabled Enoch to be taken
instead of dying. No one could ﬁnd him,
because God had taken him. Scripture
states that before Enoch was taken, God
was pleased with him.
6 No one can please God without faith.
Whoever goes to God must believe that
God exists and that he rewards those
who seek him.
7 Faith led Noah to listen when God
warned him about the things in the
future that he could not see. He obeyed
God and built a ship to save his family.
Through faith Noah condemned the
world and received God’s approval that
comes through faith.
8 Faith led Abraham to obey when God
called him to go to a place that he would
receive as an inheritance. Abraham leHEBREWS 11
41
his own country without knowing where
he was going.
9 Faith led Abraham to live as a
foreigner in the country that God had
promised him. He lived in tents, as did
Isaac and Jacob, who received the same
promise from God.
10 Abraham was wai ng for the city
that God had designed and built, the city
with permanent founda ons.
11 Faith enabled Abraham to become a
father, even though he was old and Sarah
had never been able to have children.
Abraham trusted that God would keep
his promise.
12 Abraham was as good as dead. Yet,
from this man came descendants as
numerous as the stars in the sky and as
countless as the grains of sand on the
seashore.
13 All these people died having faith.
They didn’t receive the things that GodHEBREWS 11
42
had promised them, but they saw these
things coming in the distant future
and rejoiced. They acknowledged that
they were living as strangers with no
permanent home on earth.
14 Those who say such things make it
clear that they are looking for their own
country.
15 If they had been thinking about the
country that they had le , they could
have found a way to go back.
16 Instead, these men were longing for
a be er country––a heavenly country.
That is why God is not ashamed to be
called their God. He has prepared a city
for them.
17 When God tested Abraham, faith led
him to oﬀer his son Isaac. Abraham, the
one who received the promises from
God, was willing to oﬀer his only son as
a sacriﬁce.HEBREWS 11
43
18 God had said to him, "Through Isaac
your descendants will carry on your
name."
19 Abraham believed that God could
bring Isaac back from the dead. Abraham
did receive Isaac back from the dead in a
ﬁgura ve sense.
20 Faith led Isaac to bless Jacob and
Esau.
21 While Jacob was dying, faith led him
to bless each of Joseph’s sons. He leaned
on the top of his staﬀ and worshiped
God.
22 While Joseph was dying, faith led
him to speak about the Israelites leaving
Egypt and give them instruc ons about
burying his bones.
23 Faith led Moses’ parents to hide him
for three months a er he was born. They
did this because they saw that Moses
was a beau ful baby and they were not
afraid to disobey the king’s order.HEBREWS 11
44
24 When Moses grew up, faith led
him to refuse to be known as a son of
Pharaoh’s daughter.
25 He chose to suﬀer with God’s people
rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a li le while.
26 He thought that being insulted for
Christ would be be er than having the
treasures of Egypt. He was looking ahead
to his reward.
27 Faith led Moses to leave Egypt
without being afraid of the king’s anger.
Moses didn’t give up but con nued as if
he could actually see the invisible God.
28 Faith led Moses to establish the
Passover and spread the blood on the
doorposts so that the destroying angel
would not kill the ﬁrstborn sons.
29 Faith caused the people to go
through the Red Sea as if it were dry
land. The Egyp ans also tried this, but
they drowned.HEBREWS 11
45
30 Faith caused the walls of Jericho to
fall a er the Israelites marched around
them for seven days.
31 Faith led the pros tute Rahab to
welcome the spies as friends. She was
not killed with those who refused to
obey God.
32 What more should I say? I don’t have
enough me to tell you about Gideon,
Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel,
and the prophets.
33 Through faith they conquered
kingdoms, did what God approved, and
received what God had promised. They
shut the mouths of lions,
34 put out raging ﬁres, and escaped
death. They found strength when they
were weak. They were powerful in ba le
and defeated other armies.
35 Women received their loved ones
back from the dead. Other believers
were brutally tortured but refused to beHEBREWS 11 – 12
46
released so that they might gain eternal
life.
36 Some were made fun of and
whipped, and some were chained and
put in prison.
37 Some were stoned to death, sawed
in half, and killed with swords. Some
wore the skins of sheep and goats. Some
were poor, abused, and mistreated.
38 The world didn’t deserve these good
people. Some wandered around in
deserts and mountains and lived in caves
and holes in the ground.
39 All these people were known for
their faith, but none of them received
what God had promised.
40 God planned to give us something
very special so that we would gain
eternal life with them.
1 Since we are surrounded by so
many examples of faith, we must
get rid of everything that slows us down,
12HEBREWS 12
47
especially sin that distracts us. We must
run the race that lies ahead of us and
never give up.
2 We must focus on Jesus, the source
and goal of our faith. He saw the joy
ahead of him, so he endured death
on the cross and ignored the disgrace
it brought him. Then he received the
highest posi on in heaven, the one next
to the throne of God.
3 Think about Jesus, who endured
opposi on from sinners, so that you
don’t become red and give up.
4 You struggle against sin, but your
struggles haven’t killed you.
5 You have forgo en the encouraging
words that God speaks to you as his
children: "My child, pay a en on when
the Lord disciplines you. Don’t give up
when he corrects you.HEBREWS 12
48
6 The Lord disciplines everyone he
loves. He severely disciplines everyone
he accepts as his child."
7 Endure your discipline. God corrects
you as a father corrects his children. All
children are disciplined by their fathers.
8 If you aren’t disciplined like the other
children, you aren’t part of the family.
9 On earth we have fathers who
disciplined us, and we respect them.
Shouldn’t we place ourselves under the
authority of God, the father of spirits, so
that we will live?
10 For a short me our fathers
disciplined us as they thought best. Yet,
God disciplines us for our own good so
that we can become holy like him.
11 We don’t enjoy being disciplined. It
always seems to cause more pain than
joy. But later on, those who learn from
that discipline have peace that comes
from doing what is right.HEBREWS 12
12 Strengthen your
49
red arms and weak
knees.
13 Keep walking along straight paths so
that your injured leg won’t get worse.
Instead, let it heal.
14 Try to live peacefully with everyone,
and try to live holy lives, because if you
don’t, you will not see the Lord.
15 Make sure that everyone has
kindness from God so that bi erness
doesn’t take root and grow up to cause
trouble that corrupts many of you.
16 Make sure that no one commits
sexual sin or is as concerned about
earthly things as Esau was. He sold his
rights as the ﬁrstborn son for a single
meal.
17 You know that a erwards, when he
wanted to receive the blessing that the
ﬁrstborn son was to receive, he was
rejected. Even though he begged andHEBREWS 12
50
cried for the blessing, he couldn’t do
anything to change what had happened.
18 You have not come to something
that you can feel, to a blazing ﬁre, to
darkness, to gloom, to a storm,
19 to a trumpet’s blast, and to a voice.
When your ancestors heard that voice,
they begged not to hear it say another
word.
20 They couldn’t obey the command
that was given, "If even an animal
touches the mountain, it must be stoned
to death."
21 The sight was so terrifying that even
Moses said he was trembling and afraid.
22 Instead, you have come to Mount
Zion, to the city of the living God, to
the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come
to tens of thousands of angels joyfully
gathered together
23 and to the assembly of God’s
ﬁrstborn children (whose names areHEBREWS 12
51
wri en in heaven). You have come to
a judge (the God of all people) and to
the spirits of people who have God’s
approval and have gained eternal life.
24 You have come to Jesus, who brings
the new promise from God, and to the
sprinkled blood that speaks a be er
message than Abel’s.
25 Be careful that you do not refuse to
listen when God speaks. Your ancestors
didn’t escape when they refused to
listen to God, who warned them on
earth. We certainly won’t escape if we
turn away from God, who warns us from
heaven.
26 When God spoke to your ancestors,
his voice shook the earth. But now he
has promised, "Once more I will shake
not only the earth but also the sky."
27 The words once more show clearly
that God will change what he has made.
These are the things that can be shaken.HEBREWS 12 – 13
52
Then only the things that cannot be
shaken will remain.
28 Therefore, we must be thankful
that we have a kingdom that cannot be
shaken. Because we are thankful, we
must serve God with fear and awe in a
way that pleases him.
29 A er all, our God is a destruc ve ﬁre.
1 Con nue to love each other.
2 Don’t forget to show hospitality
to believers you don’t know. By doing this
some believers have shown hospitality
to angels without being aware of it.
3 Remember those in prison as if you
were in prison with them. Remember
those who are mistreated as if you were
being mistreated.
4 Marriage is honorable in every way, so
husbands and wives should be faithful
to each other. God will judge those who
commit sexual sins, especially those who
commit adultery.
13HEBREWS 13
53
5 Don’t love money. Be happy with
what you have because God has said, "I
will never abandon you or leave you."
6 So we can conﬁdently say, "The Lord is
my helper. I will not be afraid. What can
mortals do to me?"
7 Remember your leaders who have
spoken God’s word to you. Think about
how their lives turned out, and imitate
their faith.
8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
today, and forever.
9 Don’t get carried away by all kinds
of unfamiliar teachings. Gaining inner
strength from God’s kindness is good for
us. This strength does not come from
following rules about food, rules that
don’t help those who follow them.
10 Those who serve at the tent have no
right to eat what is sacriﬁced at our altar.
11 The chief priest brings the blood of
animals into the holy place as an oﬀeringHEBREWS 13
54
for sin. But the bodies of those animals
were burned outside the Israelite camp.
12 That is why Jesus suﬀered outside the
gates of Jerusalem. He suﬀered to make
the people holy with his own blood.
13 So we must go to him outside the
camp and endure the insults he endured.
14 We don’t have a permanent city here
on earth, but we are looking for the city
that we will have in the future.
15 Through Jesus we should always
bring God a sacriﬁce of praise, that is,
words that acknowledge him.
16 Don’t forget to do good things for
others and to share what you have with
them. These are the kinds of sacriﬁces
that please God.
17 Obey your leaders, and accept their
authority. They take care of you because
they are responsible for you. Obey them
so that they may do this work joyfully
and not complain about you. (CausingHEBREWS 13
55
them to complain would not be to your
advantage.)
18 Pray for us. We are sure that our
consciences are clear because we want
to live honorably in every way.
19 I especially ask for your prayers so
that I may come back to you soon.
20 The God of peace brought the great
shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus,
back to life through the blood of an
eternal promise.
21 May this God of peace prepare you
to do every good thing he wants. May
he work in us through Jesus Christ to do
what is pleasing to him. Glory belongs to
Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
22 I urge you, brothers and sisters,
to listen pa ently to my encouraging
words. I have wri en you a short le er.
23 You know that Timothy, our brother,
has been freed. If he comes here soon,
both of us will visit you.HEBREWS 13
56
24 Greet all your leaders and all God’s
holy people. Those who are with us from
Italy greet you.
25 May God’s good will be with all of
you!James
1
1 From James, a servant of God and
of the Lord Jesus Christ. To God’s
faithful people who have been sca ered.
Gree ngs.
2 My brothers and sisters, be very
happy when you are tested in diﬀerent
ways.
3 You know that such tes ng of your
faith produces endurance.
4 Endure un l your tes ng is over. Then
you will be mature and complete, and
you won’t need anything.
5 If any of you needs wisdom to know
what you should do, you should ask
God, and he will give it to you. God is
generous to everyone and doesn’t ﬁnd
fault with them.JAMES 1
2
6 When you ask for something, don’t
have any doubts. A person who has
doubts is like a wave that is blown by the
wind and tossed by the sea.
7 A person who has doubts shouldn’t
expect to receive anything from the
Lord.
8 A person who has doubts is thinking
about two diﬀerent things at the same
me and can’t make up his mind about
anything.
9 Humble believers should be proud
because being humble makes them
important.
10 Rich believers should be proud
because being rich should make them
humble. Rich people will wither like
ﬂowers.
11 The sun rises with its scorching heat
and dries up plants. The ﬂowers drop oﬀ,
and the beauty is gone. The same thingJAMES 1
3
will happen to rich people. While they
are busy, they will die.
12 Blessed are those who endure when
they are tested. When they pass the
test, they will receive the crown of life
that God has promised to those who
love him.
13 When someone is tempted, he
shouldn’t say that God is temp ng him.
God can’t be tempted by evil, and God
doesn’t tempt anyone.
14 Everyone is tempted by his own
desires as they lure him away and trap
him.
15 Then desire becomes pregnant and
gives birth to sin. When sin grows up, it
gives birth to death.
16 My dear brothers and sisters, don’t
be fooled.
17 Every good present and every perfect
gi comes from above, from the Father
who made the sun, moon, and stars. TheJAMES 1
4
Father doesn’t change like the shi ing
shadows produced by the sun and the
moon.
18 God decided to give us life through
the word of truth to make us his most
important creatures.
19 Remember this, my dear brothers
and sisters: Everyone should be quick to
listen, slow to speak, and should not get
angry easily.
20 An angry person doesn’t do what
God approves of.
21 So get rid of all immoral behavior and
all the wicked things you do. Humbly
accept the word that God has placed in
you. This word can save you.
22 Do what God’s word says. Don’t
merely listen to it, or you will fool
yourselves.
23 If someone listens to God’s word
but doesn’t do what it says, he is like a
person who looks at his face in a mirror,JAMES 1 – 2
5
24 studies his features, goes away, and
immediately forgets what he looks like.
25 However, the person who con nues
to study God’s perfect teachings that
make people free and who remains
commi ed to them will be blessed.
People like that don’t merely listen and
forget; they actually do what God’s
teachings say.
26 If a person thinks that he is religious
but can’t control his tongue, he is
fooling himself. That person’s religion is
worthless.
27 Pure, unstained religion, according to
God our Father, is to take care of orphans
and widows when they suﬀer and to
remain uncorrupted by this world.
1 My brothers and sisters, prac ce
your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus
Christ by not favoring one person over
another.
2JAMES 2
6
2 For example, two men come to your
worship service. One man is wearing
gold rings and ﬁne clothes; the other
man, who is poor, is wearing shabby
clothes.
3 Suppose you give special a en on to
the man wearing ﬁne clothes and say to
him, "Please have a seat." But you say to
the poor man, "Stand over there," or "Sit
on the ﬂoor at my feet."
4 Aren’t you discrimina ng against
people and using a corrupt standard to
make judgments?
5 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters!
Didn’t God choose poor people in the
world to become rich in faith and to
receive the kingdom that he promised to
those who love him?
6 Yet, you show no respect to poor
people. Don’t rich people oppress you
and drag you into court?JAMES 2
7
7 Don’t they curse the good name of
Jesus, the name that was used to bless
you?
8 You are doing right if you obey this
law from the highest authority: "Love
your neighbor as you love yourself."
9 If you favor one person over another,
you’re sinning, and this law convicts you
of being disobedient.
10 If someone obeys all of God’s laws
except one, that person is guilty of
breaking all of them.
11 A er all, the one who said, "Never
commit adultery," is the same one who
said, "Never murder." If you do not
commit adultery but you murder, you
become a person who disobeys God’s
laws.
12 Talk and act as people who are going
to be judged by laws that bring freedom.JAMES 2
8
13 No mercy will be shown to those
who show no mercy to others. Mercy
triumphs over judgment.
14 My brothers and sisters, what good
does it do if someone claims to have
faith but doesn’t do any good things?
Can this kind of faith save him?
15 Suppose a believer, whether a man
or a woman, needs clothes or food
16 and one of you tells that person,
"God be with you! Stay warm, and
make sure you eat enough." If you don’t
provide for that person’s physical needs,
what good does it do?
17 In the same way, faith by itself is
dead if it doesn’t cause you to do any
good things.
18 Another person might say, "You have
faith, but I do good things." Show me
your faith apart from the good things
you do. I will show you my faith by the
good things I do.JAMES 2
9
19 You believe that there is one God.
That’s ﬁne! The demons also believe
that, and they tremble with fear.
20 You fool! Do you have to be shown
that faith which does nothing is useless?
21 Didn’t our ancestor Abraham receive
God’s approval as a result of what he
did when he oﬀered his son Isaac as a
sacriﬁce on the altar?
22 You see that Abraham’s faith and
what he did worked together. His faith
was shown to be genuine by what he
did.
23 The Scripture passage came true. It
says, "Abraham believed God, and that
faith was regarded by God to be his
approval of Abraham." So Abraham was
called God’s friend.
24 You see that a person receives God’s
approval because of what he does, not
only because of what he believes.JAMES 2 – 3
25 The same is true of the pros
10
tute
Rahab who welcomed the spies and
sent them away on another road. She
received God’s approval because of what
she did.
26 A body that doesn’t breathe is dead.
In the same way faith that does nothing
is dead.
1 Brothers and sisters, not many of
you should become teachers. You
know that we who teach will be judged
more severely.
2 All of us make a lot of mistakes. If
someone doesn’t make any mistakes
when he speaks, he would be perfect.
He would be able to control everything
he does.
3 We put bits in the mouths of horses to
make them obey us, and we have control
over everything they do.
4 The same thing is true for ships. They
are very big and are driven by strong
3JAMES 3
11
winds. Yet, by using small rudders, pilots
steer ships wherever they want them to
go.
5 In the same way the tongue is a small
part of the body, but it can brag about
doing important things. A large forest
can be set on ﬁre by a li le ﬂame.
6 The tongue is that kind of ﬂame. It is
a world of evil among the parts of our
bodies, and it completely contaminates
our bodies. The tongue sets our lives on
ﬁre, and is itself set on ﬁre from hell.
7 People have tamed all kinds of
animals, birds, rep les, and sea
creatures.
8 Yet, no one can tame the tongue. It is
an uncontrollable evil ﬁlled with deadly
poison.
9 With our tongues we praise our Lord
and Father. Yet, with the same tongues
we curse people, who were created in
God’s likeness.JAMES 3
12
10 Praise and curses come from the
same mouth. My brothers and sisters,
this should not happen!
11 Do clean and polluted water ﬂow out
of the same spring?
12 My brothers and sisters, can a ﬁg
tree produce olives? Can a grapevine
produce ﬁgs? In the same way, a pool of
salt water can’t produce fresh water.
13 Do any of you have wisdom and
insight? Show this by living the right
way with the humility that comes from
wisdom.
14 But if you are bi erly jealous and
ﬁlled with self–centered ambi on, don’t
brag. Don’t say that you are wise when it
isn’t true.
15 That kind of wisdom doesn’t come
from above. It belongs to this world. It is
self–centered and demonic.JAMES 3 – 4
13
16 Wherever there is jealousy and
rivalry, there is disorder and every kind
of evil.
17 However, the wisdom that comes
from above is ﬁrst of all pure. Then it is
peaceful, gentle, obedient, ﬁlled with
mercy and good deeds, impar al, and
sincere.
18 A harvest that has God’s approval
comes from the peace planted by
peacemakers.
1 What causes ﬁghts and quarrels
among you? Aren’t they caused by
the selﬁsh desires that ﬁght to control
you?
2 You want what you don’t have, so you
commit murder. You’re determined to
have things, but you can’t get what you
want. You quarrel and ﬁght. You don’t
have the things you want, because you
don’t pray for them.
4JAMES 4
14
3 When you pray for things, you don’t
get them because you want them for the
wrong reason––for your own pleasure.
4 You unfaithful people! Don’t you know
that love for this evil world is hatred
toward God? Whoever wants to be a
friend of this world is an enemy of God.
5 Do you think this passage means
nothing? It says, "The Spirit that lives in
us wants us to be his own."
6 But God shows us even more
kindness. Scripture says, "God opposes
arrogant people, but he is kind to
humble people."
7 So place yourselves under God’s
authority. Resist the devil, and he will
run away from you.
8 Come close to God, and he will come
close to you. Clean up your lives, you
sinners, and clear your minds, you
doubters.JAMES 4
15
9 Be miserable, mourn, and cry. Turn
your laughter into mourning and your
joy into gloom.
10 Humble yourselves in the Lord’s
presence. Then he will give you a high
posi on.
11 Brothers and sisters, stop slandering
each other. Those who slander and
judge other believers slander and judge
God’s teachings. If you judge God’s
teachings, you are no longer following
them. Instead, you are judging them.
12 There is only one teacher and judge.
He is able to save or destroy you. So who
are you to judge your neighbor?
13 Pay a en on to this! You’re saying,
"Today or tomorrow we will go into
some city, stay there a year, conduct
business, and make money."
14 You don’t know what will happen
tomorrow. What is life? You are a mistJAMES 4 – 5
16
that is seen for a moment and then
disappears.
15 Instead, you should say, "If the Lord
wants us to, we will live and carry out
our plans."
16 However, you brag because you’re
arrogant. All such bragging is evil.
17 Whoever knows what is right but
doesn’t do it is sinning.
1 Pay a en on to this if you’re rich.
Cry and moan about the misery that
is coming to you.
2 Your riches have decayed, and your
clothes have been eaten by moths.
3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and
their corrosion will be used as evidence
against you. Like ﬁre, it will destroy your
body. You have stored up riches in these
last days.
4 The wages you refused to pay the
people who harvested your ﬁelds shout
to God against you. The Lord of Armies
5JAMES 5
17
has heard the cries of those who gather
the crops.
5 You have lived in luxury and pleasure
here on earth. You have fa ened
yourselves for the day of slaughter.
6 You have condemned and murdered
people who have God’s approval, even
though they didn’t resist you.
7 Brothers and sisters, be pa ent un l
the Lord comes again. See how farmers
wait for their precious crops to grow.
They wait pa ently for fall and spring
rains.
8 You, too, must be pa ent. Don’t give
up hope. The Lord will soon be here.
9 Brothers and sisters, stop complaining
about each other, or you will be
condemned. Realize that the judge is
standing at the door.
10 Brothers and sisters, follow the
example of the prophets who spoke inJAMES 5
18
the name of the Lord. They were pa ent
when they suﬀered unjustly.
11 We consider those who endure
to be blessed. You have heard about
Job’s endurance. You saw that the Lord
ended Job’s suﬀering because the Lord
is compassionate and merciful.
12 Above all things, my brothers and
sisters, do not take an oath on anything
in heaven or on earth. Do not take any
oath. If you mean yes, say yes. If you
mean no, say no. Do this so that you
won’t be condemned.
13 If any of you are having trouble, pray.
If you are happy, sing psalms.
14 If you are sick, call for the church
leaders. Have them pray for you and
anoint you with olive oil in the name of
the Lord.
15 (Prayers oﬀered in faith will save
those who are sick, and the Lord willJAMES 5
19
cure them.) If you have sinned, you will
be forgiven.
16 So admit your sins to each other, and
pray for each other so that you will be
healed. Prayers oﬀered by those who
have God’s approval are eﬀec ve.
17 Elijah was human like us. Yet, when
he prayed that it wouldn’t rain, no rain
fell on the ground for three–and–a–half
years.
18 Then he prayed again. It rained, and
the ground produced crops.
19 My brothers and sisters, if one of you
wanders from the truth, someone can
bring that person back.
20 Realize that whoever brings a sinner
back from the error of his ways will save
him from death, and many sins will be
forgiven.1 Peter
1
1 From Peter, an apostle of Jesus
Christ. To God’s chosen people who
are temporary residents in the world and
are sca ered throughout the provinces
of Pontus, Gala a, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia.
2 God the Father knew you long ago
and chose you to live holy lives with the
Spirit’s help so that you are obedient to
Jesus Christ and are sprinkled with his
blood. May good will and peace ﬁll your
lives!
3 Praise the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ! God has given us a new
birth because of his great mercy. We
have been born into a new life that has a
conﬁdence which is alive because Jesus
Christ has come back to life.1 PETER 1
2
4 We have been born into a new life
which has an inheritance that can’t be
destroyed or corrupted and can’t fade
away. That inheritance is kept in heaven
for you,
5 since you are guarded by God’s power
through faith for a salva on that is ready
to be revealed at the end of me.
6 You are extremely happy about these
things, even though you have to suﬀer
diﬀerent kinds of trouble for a li le while
now.
7 The purpose of these troubles is to
test your faith as ﬁre tests how genuine
gold is. Your faith is more precious than
gold, and by passing the test, it gives
praise, glory, and honor to God. This will
happen when Jesus Christ appears again.
8 Although you have never seen Christ,
you love him. You don’t see him now, but
you believe in him. You are extremely1 PETER 1
3
happy with joy and praise that can hardly
be expressed in words
9 as you obtain the salva on that is the
goal of your faith.
10 The prophets carefully researched
and inves gated this salva on. Long ago
they spoke about God’s kindness that
would come to you.
11 So they tried to ﬁnd out what me
or situa on the Spirit of Christ kept
referring to whenever he predicted
Christ’s suﬀerings and the glory that
would follow.
12 God revealed to the prophets that
the things they had spoken were not
for their own beneﬁt but for yours.
What the prophets had spoken, the
Holy Spirit, who was sent from heaven,
has now made known to you by those
who spread the Good News among you.
These are things that even the angels
want to look into.1 PETER 1
4
13 Therefore, your minds must be
clear and ready for ac on. Place your
conﬁdence completely in what God’s
kindness will bring you when Jesus Christ
appears again.
14 Because you are children who obey
God, don’t live the kind of lives you once
lived. Once you lived to sa sfy your
desires because you didn’t know any
be er.
15 But because the God who called you
is holy you must be holy in every aspect
of your life.
16 Scripture says, "Be holy, because I am
holy."
17 So if you call God your Father, live
your me as temporary residents on
earth in fear. He is the God who judges
all people by what they have done, and
he doesn’t play favorites.
18 Realize that you weren’t set free
from the worthless life handed down to1 PETER 1
5
you from your ancestors by a payment
of silver or gold which can be destroyed.
19 Rather, the payment that freed you
was the precious blood of Christ, the
lamb with no defects or imperfec ons.
20 He is the lamb who was known long
ago before the world existed, but for
your good he became publicly known in
the last period of me.
21 Through him you believe in God who
brought Christ back to life and gave him
glory. So your faith and conﬁdence are in
God.
22 Love each other with a warm love
that comes from the heart. A er all, you
have puriﬁed yourselves by obeying the
truth. As a result you have a sincere love
for each other.
23 You have been born again, not from a
seed that can be destroyed, but through
God’s everlas ng word that can’t be
destroyed. That’s why Scripture says,1 PETER 1 – 2
6
24 "All people are like grass, and all their
beauty is like a ﬂower of the ﬁeld. The
grass dries up and the ﬂower drops oﬀ,
25 but the word of the Lord lasts
forever." This word is the Good News
that was told to you.
1 So get rid of every kind of evil,
every kind of decep on, hypocrisy,
jealousy, and every kind of slander.
2 Desire God’s pure word as newborn
babies desire milk. Then you will grow in
your salva on.
3 Certainly you have tasted that the
Lord is good!
4 You are coming to Christ, the living
stone who was rejected by humans but
was chosen as precious by God.
5 You come to him as living stones, a
spiritual house that is being built into
a holy priesthood. So oﬀer spiritual
sacriﬁces that God accepts through Jesus
Christ.
21 PETER 2
7
6 That is why Scripture says, "I am laying
a chosen and precious cornerstone in
Zion, and the person who believes in
him will never be ashamed."
7 This honor belongs to those who
believe. But to those who don’t believe:
"The stone that the builders rejected has
become the cornerstone,
8 a stone that people trip over, a large
rock that people ﬁnd oﬀensive." The
people tripped over the word because
they refused to believe it. Therefore, this
is how they ended up.
9 However, you are chosen people, a
royal priesthood, a holy na on, people
who belong to God. You were chosen to
tell about the excellent quali es of God,
who called you out of darkness into his
marvelous light.
10 Once you were not God’s people, but
now you are. Once you were not shown1 PETER 2
8
mercy, but now you have been shown
mercy.
11 Dear friends, since you are foreigners
and temporary residents in the world,
I’m encouraging you to keep away from
the desires of your corrupt nature. These
desires constantly a ack you.
12 Live decent lives among unbelievers.
Then, although they ridicule you as if
you were doing wrong while they are
watching you do good things, they will
praise God on the day he comes to help
you.
13 Place yourselves under the authority
of human governments to please the
Lord. Obey the emperor. He holds the
highest posi on of authority.
14 Also obey governors. They are people
the emperor has sent to punish those
who do wrong and to praise those who
do right.1 PETER 2
9
15 God wants you to silence the
ignorance of foolish people by doing
what is right.
16 Live as free people, but don’t hide
behind your freedom when you do evil.
Instead, use your freedom to serve God.
17 Honor everyone. Love your brothers
and sisters in the faith. Fear God. Honor
the emperor.
18 Slaves, place yourselves under the
authority of your owners and show them
complete respect. Obey not only those
owners who are good and kind, but also
those who are unfair.
19 God is pleased if a person is aware of
him while enduring the pains of unjust
suﬀering.
20 What credit do you deserve if you
endure a bea ng for doing something
wrong? But if you endure suﬀering for
doing something good, God is pleased
with you.1 PETER 2 – 3
10
21 God called you to endure suﬀering
because Christ suﬀered for you. He le
you an example so that you could follow
in his footsteps.
22 Christ never commi ed any sin. He
never spoke decei ully.
23 Christ never verbally abused those
who verbally abused him. When he
suﬀered, he didn’t make any threats but
le everything to the one who judges
fairly.
24 Christ carried our sins in his body on
the cross so that freed from our sins, we
could live a life that has God’s approval.
His wounds have healed you.
25 You were like lost sheep. Now you
have come back to the shepherd and
bishop of your lives.
1 Wives, in a similar way, place
yourselves under your husbands’
authority. Some husbands may not obey
God’s word. Their wives could win these
31 PETER 3
11
men for Christ by the way they live
without saying anything.
2 Their husbands would see how pure
and reverent their lives are.
3 Wives must not let their beauty be
something external. Beauty doesn’t
come from hairstyles, gold jewelry, or
clothes.
4 Rather, beauty is something internal
that can’t be destroyed. Beauty
expresses itself in a gentle and quiet
a tude which God considers precious.
5 A er all, this is how holy women
who had conﬁdence in God expressed
their beauty in the past. They placed
themselves under their husbands’
authority
6 as Sarah did. Sarah obeyed Abraham
and spoke to him respec ully. You
became Sarah’s daughters by not le ng
anything make you afraid to do good.1 PETER 3
12
7 Husbands, in a similar way, live with
your wives with understanding since
they are weaker than you are. Honor
your wives as those who share God’s
life–giving kindness so that nothing will
interfere with your prayers.
8 Finally, everyone must live in harmony,
be sympathe c, love each other, have
compassion, and be humble.
9 Don’t pay people back with evil for
the evil they do to you, or ridicule those
who ridicule you. Instead, bless them,
because you were called to inherit a
blessing.
10 "People who want to live a full life
and enjoy good days must keep their
tongues from saying evil things, and
their lips from speaking decei ul things.
11 They must turn away from evil and
do good. They must seek peace and
pursue it.1 PETER 3
13
12 The Lord’s eyes are on those who do
what he approves. His ears hear their
prayer. The Lord confronts those who do
evil."
13 Who will harm you if you are devoted
to doing what is good?
14 But even if you suﬀer for doing what
God approves, you are blessed. Don’t be
afraid of those who want to harm you.
Don’t get upset.
15 But dedicate your lives to Christ as
Lord. Always be ready to defend your
conﬁdence in God when anyone asks
you to explain it. However, make your
defense with gentleness and respect.
16 Keep your conscience clear. Then
those who treat the good Chris an life
you live with contempt will feel ashamed
that they have ridiculed you.
17 A er all, if it is God’s will, it’s be er
to suﬀer for doing good than for doing
wrong.1 PETER 3
14
18 This is true because Christ suﬀered
for our sins once. He was an innocent
person, but he suﬀered for guilty people
so that he could bring you to God. His
body was put to death, but he was
brought to life through his spirit.
19 In it he also went to proclaim his
victory to the spirits kept in prison.
20 They are like those who disobeyed
long ago in the days of Noah when God
waited pa ently while Noah built the
ship. In this ship a few people––eight in
all––were saved by water.
21 Bap sm, which is like that water,
now saves you. Bap sm doesn’t save
by removing dirt from the body. Rather,
bap sm is a request to God for a clear
conscience. It saves you through Jesus
Christ, who came back from death to
life.
22 Christ has gone to heaven where he
has the highest posi on that God gives.1 PETER 4
15
Angels, rulers, and powers have been
placed under his authority.
1 Since Christ has suﬀered physically,
take the same a tude that he had.
(A person who has suﬀered physically no
longer sins.)
2 That way you won’t be guided by
sinful human desires as you live the rest
of your lives on earth. Instead, you will
be guided by what God wants you to do.
3 You spent enough me in the past
doing what unbelievers like to do. You
were promiscuous, had sinful desires,
got drunk, went to wild par es, and took
part in the forbidden worship of false
gods.
4 Unbelievers insult you now because
they are surprised that you no longer
join them in the same excesses of wild
living.
41 PETER 4
16
5 They will give an account to the one
who is ready to judge the living and the
dead.
6 A er all, the Good News was told to
people like that, although they are now
dead. It was told to them so that they
could be judged like humans in their
earthly lives and live like God in their
spiritual lives.
7 The end of everything is near.
Therefore, prac ce self–control, and
keep your minds clear so that you can
pray.
8 Above all, love each other warmly,
because love covers many sins.
9 Welcome each other as guests
without complaining.
10 Each of you as a good manager must
use the gi that God has given you to
serve others.
11 Whoever speaks must speak God’s
words. Whoever serves must serve with1 PETER 4
17
the strength God supplies so that in
every way God receives glory through
Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to
Jesus Christ forever and ever! Amen.
12 Dear friends, don’t be surprised by
the ﬁery troubles that are coming in
order to test you. Don’t feel as though
something strange is happening to you,
13 but be happy as you share Christ’s
suﬀerings. Then you will also be full of
joy when he appears again in his glory.
14 If you are insulted because of the
name of Christ, you are blessed because
the Spirit of glory––the Spirit of God––is
res ng on you.
15 If you suﬀer, you shouldn’t suﬀer
for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or
troublemaker.
16 If you suﬀer for being a Chris an,
don’t feel ashamed, but praise God for
being called that name.1 PETER 4 – 5
17 The
18
me has come for the judgment
to begin, and it will begin with God’s
family. If it starts with us, what will be
the end for those who refuse to obey
the Good News of God?
18 If it’s hard for the person who has
God’s approval to be saved, what will
happen to the godless sinner?
19 Those who suﬀer because that
is God’s will for them must entrust
themselves to a faithful creator and
con nue to do what is good.
1 I appeal to your spiritual leaders. I
make this appeal as a spiritual leader
who also witnessed Christ’s suﬀerings
and will share in the glory that will be
revealed.
2 Be shepherds over the ﬂock God has
entrusted to you. Watch over it as God
does: Don’t do this because you have to,
but because you want to. Don’t do it out
of greed, but out of a desire to serve.
51 PETER 5
19
3 Don’t be rulers over the people
entrusted to you, but be examples for
the ﬂock to follow.
4 Then, when the chief shepherd
appears, you will receive the crown of
glory that will never fade away.
5 Young people, in a similar way, place
yourselves under the authority of
spiritual leaders. Furthermore, all of you
must serve each other with humility,
because God opposes the arrogant but
favors the humble.
6 Be humbled by God’s power so that
when the right me comes he will honor
you.
7 Turn all your anxiety over to God
because he cares for you.
8 Keep your mind clear, and be alert.
Your opponent the devil is prowling
around like a roaring lion as he looks for
someone to devour.1 PETER 5
20
9 Be ﬁrm in the faith and resist him,
knowing that other believers throughout
the world are going through the same
kind of suﬀering.
10 God, who shows you his kindness
and who has called you through Christ
Jesus to his eternal glory, will restore
you, strengthen you, make you strong,
and support you as you suﬀer for a li le
while.
11 Power belongs to him forever. Amen.
12 I’ve wri en this short le er to you
and I’m sending it by Silvanus, whom I
regard as a faithful brother. I’ve wri en
to encourage you and to tes fy that this
is God’s genuine good will. Remain ﬁrmly
established in it!
13 Your sister church in Babylon, chosen
by God, and my son Mark send you
gree ngs.
14 Greet each other with a kiss of love.
Peace to all of you who are in Christ.2 Peter
1
1 From Simon Peter, a servant and
apostle of Jesus Christ. To those who
have obtained a faith that is as valuable
as ours, a faith based on the approval
that comes from our God and Savior,
Jesus Christ.
2 May good will and peace ﬁll your lives
through your knowledge about Jesus,
our God and Lord!
3 God’s divine power has given us
everything we need for life and for
godliness. This power was given to us
through knowledge of the one who
called us by his own glory and integrity.
4 Through his glory and integrity he
has given us his promises that are
of the highest value. Through these
promises you will share in the divine2 PETER 1
2
nature because you have escaped the
corrup on that sinful desires cause in
the world.
5 Because of this, make every eﬀort
to add integrity to your faith; and to
integrity add knowledge;
6 to knowledge add self–control;
to self–control add endurance; to
endurance add godliness;
7 to godliness add Chris an aﬀec on;
and to Chris an aﬀec on add love.
8 If you have these quali es and they
are increasing, it demonstrates that your
knowledge about our Lord Jesus Christ is
living and produc ve.
9 If these quali es aren’t present in
your life, you’re shortsighted and have
forgo en that you were cleansed from
your past sins.
10 Therefore, brothers and sisters, use
more eﬀort to make God’s calling and2 PETER 1
3
choosing of you secure. If you keep
doing this, you will never fall away.
11 Then you will also be given the
wealth of entering into the eternal
kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.
12 Therefore, I will always remind you
about these quali es, although you
already know about them and are
well–grounded in the truth that you now
have.
13 As long as I’m s ll alive, I think it’s
right to refresh your memory.
14 I know that I will die soon. Our Lord
Jesus Christ has made that clear to me.
15 So I will make every eﬀort to see that
you remember these things a er I die.
16 When we apostles told you about
the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, we didn’t base our message on
clever myths that we made up. Rather,2 PETER 1
4
we witnessed his majesty with our own
eyes.
17 For example, we were eyewitnesses
when he received honor and glory from
God the Father and when the voice of
our majes c God spoke these words to
him: "This is my Son, whom I love and in
whom I delight."
18 We heard that voice speak to him
from heaven when we were with him on
the holy mountain.
19 So we regard the words of the
prophets as conﬁrmed beyond all doubt.
You’re doing well by paying a en on to
their words. Con nue to pay a en on as
you would to a light that shines in a dark
place as you wait for day to come and
the morning star to rise in your hearts.
20 First, you must understand this: No
prophecy in Scripture is a ma er of one’s
own interpreta on.2 PETER 1 – 2
5
21 No prophecy ever originated from
humans. Instead, it was given by the
Holy Spirit as humans spoke under God’s
direc on.
1 False prophets were among God’s
people in the past, as false teachers
will be among you. They will secretly
bring in their own destruc ve teachings.
They will deny the Lord, who has bought
them, and they will bring themselves
swi destruc on.
2 Many people will follow them in their
sexual freedom and will cause others to
dishonor the way of truth.
3 In their greed they will use good–
sounding arguments to exploit you. The
verdict against them from long ago is
s ll in force, and their destruc on is not
asleep.
4 God didn’t spare angels who sinned.
He threw them into hell, where he has
22 PETER 2
6
secured them with chains of darkness
and is holding them for judgment.
5 God didn’t spare the ancient world
either. He brought the ﬂood on the world
of ungodly people, but he protected
Noah and seven other people. Noah was
his messenger who told people about
the kind of life that has God’s approval.
6 God condemned the ci es of Sodom
and Gomorrah and destroyed them by
burning them to ashes. He made those
ci es an example to ungodly people of
what is going to happen to them.
7 Yet, God rescued Lot, a man who had
his approval. Lot was distressed by the
lifestyle of people who had no principles
and lived in sexual freedom.
8 Although he was a man who had God’s
approval, he lived among the people of
Sodom and Gomorrah. Each day was like
torture to him as he saw and heard the
immoral things that people did.2 PETER 2
7
9 Since the Lord did all this, he knows
how to rescue godly people when they
are tested. He also knows how to hold
immoral people for punishment on the
day of judgment.
10 This is especially true of those who
follow their corrupt nature along the
path of impure desires and who despise
the Lord’s authority. These false teachers
are bold and arrogant. They aren’t afraid
to insult the Lord’s glory.
11 Angels, who have more strength and
power than these teachers, don’t bring
an insul ng judgment against them from
the Lord.
12 These false teachers insult what they
don’t understand. They are like animals,
which are creatures of ins nct that are
born to be caught and killed. So they will
be destroyed like animals
13 and lose what their wrongdoing
earned them. These false teachers are2 PETER 2
8
stains and blemishes. They take pleasure
in holding wild par es in broad daylight.
They especially enjoy deceiving you
while they eat with you.
14 They’re always looking for an
adulterous woman. They can’t stop
looking for sin as they seduce people
who aren’t sure of what they believe.
Their minds are focused on their greed.
They are cursed.
15 These false teachers have le the
straight path and wandered oﬀ to follow
the path of Balaam, son of Beor. Balaam
loved what his wrongdoing earned him.
16 But he was convicted for his evil. A
donkey, which normally can’t talk, spoke
with a human voice and wouldn’t allow
the prophet to con nue his insanity.
17 These false teachers are dried–up
springs. They are a mist blown around
by a storm. Gloomy darkness has been
kept for them.2 PETER 2
9
18 They arrogantly use nonsense to
seduce people by appealing to their
sexual desires, especially to sexual
freedom. They seduce people who have
just escaped from those who live in
error.
19 They promise these people freedom,
but they themselves are slaves to
corrup on. A person is a slave to
whatever he gives in to.
20 People can know our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ and escape the world’s ﬁlth.
But if they get involved in this ﬁlth again
and give in to it, they are worse oﬀ than
they were before.
21 It would have been be er for them
never to have known the way of life that
God approves of than to know it and
turn their backs on the holy life God told
them to live.
22 These proverbs have come true for
them: "A dog goes back to its vomit,"2 PETER 3
10
and "A sow that has been washed goes
back to roll around in the mud."
1 Dear friends, this is the second
le er I’m wri ng to you. In both
le ers I’m trying to refresh your memory.
2 I want you to remember the
words spoken in the past by the holy
prophets and what the Lord and Savior
commanded you through your apostles.
3 First, you must understand this: In the
last days people who follow their own
desires will appear. These disrespec ul
people will ridicule God’s promise
4 by saying, "What’s happened to
his promise to return? Ever since our
ancestors died, everything con nues as
it did from the beginning of the world."
5 They are deliberately ignoring one
fact: Because of God’s word, heaven and
earth existed a long me ago. The earth
appeared out of water and was kept
alive by water.
32 PETER 3
11
6 Water also ﬂooded and destroyed
that world.
7 By God’s word, the present heaven
and earth are designated to be burned.
They are being kept un l the day ungodly
people will be judged and destroyed.
8 Dear friends, don’t ignore this fact:
One day with the Lord is like a thousand
years, and a thousand years are like one
day.
9 The Lord isn’t slow to do what he
promised, as some people think. Rather,
he is pa ent for your sake. He doesn’t
want to destroy anyone but wants all
people to have an opportunity to turn to
him and change the way they think and
act.
10 The day of the Lord will come like a
thief. On that day heaven will pass away
with a roaring sound. Everything that
makes up the universe will burn and be2 PETER 3
12
destroyed. The earth and everything that
people have done on it will be exposed.
11 All these things will be destroyed in
this way. So think of the kind of holy and
godly lives you must live
12 as you look forward to the day of God
and eagerly wait for it to come. When
that day comes, heaven will be on ﬁre
and will be destroyed. Everything that
makes up the universe will burn and
melt.
13 But we look forward to what God has
promised––a new heaven and a new
earth––a place where everything that
has God’s approval lives.
14 Therefore, dear friends, with this to
look forward to, make every eﬀort to
have him ﬁnd you at peace, without
spiritual stains or blemishes.
15 Think of our Lord’s pa ence as an
opportunity for us to be saved. This is2 PETER 3
13
what our dear brother Paul wrote to you
about, using the wisdom God gave him.
16 He talks about this subject in all his
le ers. Some things in his le ers are
hard to understand. Ignorant people
and people who aren’t sure of what
they believe distort what Paul says in his
le ers the same way they distort the
rest of the Scriptures. These people will
be destroyed.
17 Dear friends, you already know these
things. So be on your guard not to be
carried away by the decep on of people
who have no principles. Then you won’t
fall from your ﬁrm posi on.
18 But grow in the good will and
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. Glory belongs to him now and for
that eternal day! Amen.1 John
1
1 The Word of life existed from the
beginning. We have heard it. We
have seen it. We observed and touched
it.
2 This life was revealed to us. We have
seen it, and we tes fy about it. We are
repor ng to you about this eternal life
that was in the presence of the Father
and was revealed to us.
3 This is the life we have seen and
heard. We are repor ng about it to
you also so that you, too, can have a
rela onship with us. Our rela onship is
with the Father and with his Son Jesus
Christ.
4 We are wri ng this so that we can be
completely ﬁlled with joy.1 JOHN 1
2
5 This is the message we heard from
Christ and are repor ng to you: God is
light, and there isn’t any darkness in him.
6 If we say, "We have a rela onship
with God" and yet live in the dark, we’re
lying. We aren’t being truthful.
7 But if we live in the light in the same
way that God is in the light, we have a
rela onship with each other. And the
blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from
every sin.
8 If we say, "We aren’t sinful" we are
deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not
in us.
9 God is faithful and reliable. If we
confess our sins, he forgives them and
cleanses us from everything we’ve done
wrong.
10 If we say, "We have never sinned,"
we turn God into a liar and his Word is
not in us.1 JOHN 2
1 My dear children, I’m wri
3
ng this
to you so that you will not sin. Yet, if
anyone does sin, we have Jesus Christ,
who has God’s full approval. He speaks
on our behalf when we come into the
presence of the Father.
2 He is the payment for our sins, and
not only for our sins, but also for the sins
of the whole world.
3 We are sure that we know Christ if we
obey his commandments.
4 The person who says, "I know him,"
but doesn’t obey his commandments is
a liar. The truth isn’t in that person.
5 But whoever obeys what Christ says is
the kind of person in whom God’s love is
perfected. That’s how we know we are
in Christ.
6 Those who say that they live in him
must live the same way he lived.
7 Dear friends, it’s not as though
I’m wri ng to give you a new
21 JOHN 2
4
commandment. Rather, I’m giving you
an old commandment that you’ve
had from the beginning. It’s the old
commandment you’ve already heard.
8 On the other hand, I’m wri ng to
give you a new commandment. It’s a
truth that exists in Christ and in you: The
darkness is fading, and the true light is
already shining.
9 Those who say that they are in the
light but hate other believers are s ll in
the dark.
10 Those who love other believers live
in the light. Nothing will destroy the faith
of those who live in the light.
11 Those who hate other believers are in
the dark and live in the dark. They don’t
know where they’re going, because they
can’t see in the dark.
12 I’m wri ng to you, dear children,
because your sins are forgiven through
Christ.1 JOHN 2
13 I’m wri
5
ng to you, fathers, because
you know Christ who has existed from
the beginning. I’m wri ng to you, young
people, because you have won the
victory over the evil one.
14 I’ve wri en to you, children, because
you know the Father. I’ve wri en to you,
fathers, because you know Christ, who
has existed from the beginning. I’ve
wri en to you, young people, because
you are strong and God’s word lives in
you. You have won the victory over the
evil one.
15 Don’t love the world and what it
oﬀers. Those who love the world don’t
have the Father’s love in them.
16 Not everything that the world
oﬀers––physical gra ﬁca on, greed, and
extravagant lifestyles––comes from the
Father. It comes from the world, and1 JOHN 2
6
17 the world and its evil desires are
passing away. But the person who does
what God wants lives forever.
18 Children, it’s the end of me. You’ve
heard that an an christ is coming.
Certainly, many an christs are already
here. That’s how we know it’s the end of
me.
19 They le us. However, they were
never really part of us. If they had been,
they would have stayed with us. But by
leaving they made it clear that none of
them were part of us.
20 The Holy One has anointed you, so
all of you have knowledge.
21 I’m wri ng to you because you know
the truth, not because you don’t know
the truth. You know that no lie ever
comes from the truth.
22 Who is a liar? Who else but the
person who rejects Jesus as the1 JOHN 2
7
Messiah? The person who rejects the
Father and the Son is an an christ.
23 Everyone who rejects the Son doesn’t
have the Father either. The person who
acknowledges the Son also has the
Father.
24 Make sure that the message you
heard from the beginning lives in you. If
that message lives in you, you will also
live in the Son and in the Father.
25 Christ has given us the promise of
eternal life.
26 I’m wri ng to you about those who
are trying to deceive you.
27 The anoin ng you received from
Christ lives in you. You don’t need
anyone to teach you something else.
Instead, Christ’s anoin ng teaches you
about everything. His anoin ng is true
and contains no lie. So live in Christ as he
taught you to do.1 JOHN 2 – 3
8
28 Now, dear children, live in Christ.
Then, when he appears we will have
conﬁdence, and when he comes we
won’t turn from him in shame.
29 If you know that Christ has God’s
approval, you also know that everyone
who does what God approves of has
been born from God.
1 Consider this: The Father has given
us his love. He loves us so much
that we are actually called God’s dear
children. And that’s what we are. For
this reason the world doesn’t recognize
us, and it didn’t recognize him either.
2 Dear friends, now we are God’s
children. What we will be isn’t
completely clear yet. We do know that
when Christ appears we will be like him
because we will see him as he is.
3 So all people who have this conﬁdence
in Christ keep themselves pure, as Christ
is pure.
31 JOHN 3
9
4 Those who live sinful lives are
disobeying God. Sin is disobedience.
5 You know that Christ appeared in
order to take away our sins. He isn’t
sinful.
6 Those who live in Christ don’t go on
sinning. Those who go on sinning haven’t
seen or known Christ.
7 Dear children, don’t let anyone
deceive you. Whoever does what God
approves of has God’s approval as Christ
has God’s approval.
8 The person who lives a sinful life
belongs to the devil, because the devil
has been commi ng sin since the
beginning. The reason that the Son of
God appeared was to destroy what the
devil does.
9 Those who have been born from God
don’t live sinful lives. What God has said
lives in them, and they can’t live sinful
lives. They have been born from God.1 JOHN 3
10
10 This is the way God’s children are
dis nguished from the devil’s children.
Everyone who doesn’t do what is right
or love other believers isn’t God’s child.
11 The message that you have heard
from the beginning is to love each other.
12 Don’t be like Cain. He was a child of
the evil one and murdered his brother.
And why did Cain murder his brother?
Because the things Cain did were evil
and the things his brother did had God’s
approval.
13 Brothers and sisters, don’t be
surprised if the world hates you.
14 We know that we have passed from
death to life, because we love other
believers. The person who doesn’t grow
in love remains in death.
15 Everyone who hates another believer
is a murderer, and you know that a
murderer doesn’t have eternal life.1 JOHN 3
11
16 We understand what love is when
we realize that Christ gave his life for us.
That means we must give our lives for
other believers.
17 Now, suppose a person has enough
to live on and no ces another believer
in need. How can God’s love be in that
person if he doesn’t bother to help the
other believer?
18 Dear children, we must show love
through ac ons that are sincere, not
through empty words.
19 This is how we will know that we
belong to the truth and how we will be
reassured in his presence.
20 Whenever our conscience condemns
us, we will be reassured that God is
greater than our conscience and knows
everything.
21 Dear friends, if our conscience
doesn’t condemn us, we can boldly look
to God1 JOHN 3 – 4
12
22 and receive from him anything we
ask. We receive it because we obey his
commandments and do what pleases
him.
23 This is his commandment: to believe
in his Son, the one named Jesus Christ,
and to love each other as he commanded
us.
24 Those who obey Christ’s
commandments live in God, and
God lives in them. We know that he lives
in us because he has given us the Spirit.
1 Dear friends, don’t believe all
people who say that they have the
Spirit. Instead, test them. See whether
the spirit they have is from God, because
there are many false prophets in the
world.
2 This is how you can recognize God’s
Spirit: Every person who declares that
Jesus Christ has come as a human has
the Spirit that is from God.
41 JOHN 4
13
3 But every person who doesn’t declare
that Jesus Christ has come as a human
has a spirit that isn’t from God. This is
the spirit of the an christ that you have
heard is coming. That spirit is already in
the world.
4 Dear children, you belong to God. So
you have won the victory over these
people, because the one who is in you is
greater than the one who is in the world.
5 These people belong to the world.
That’s why they speak the thoughts of
the world, and the world listens to them.
6 We belong to God. The person who
knows God listens to us. Whoever
doesn’t belong to God doesn’t listen to
us. That’s how we can tell the Spirit of
truth from the spirit of lies.
7 Dear friends, we must love each other
because love comes from God. Everyone
who loves has been born from God and
knows God.1 JOHN 4
14
8 The person who doesn’t love doesn’t
know God, because God is love.
9 God has shown us his love by sending
his only Son into the world so that we
could have life through him.
10 This is love: not that we have loved
God, but that he loved us and sent his
Son to be the payment for our sins.
11 Dear friends, if this is the way God
loved us, we must also love each other.
12 No one has ever seen God. If we love
each other, God lives in us, and his love
is perfected in us.
13 We know that we live in him and he
lives in us because he has given us his
Spirit.
14 We have seen and tes fy to the fact
that the Father sent his Son as the Savior
of the world.
15 God lives in those who declare that
Jesus is the Son of God, and they live in
God.1 JOHN 4
15
16 We have known and believed that
God loves us. God is love. Those who live
in God’s love live in God, and God lives
in them.
17 God’s love has reached its goal in us.
So we look ahead with conﬁdence to
the day of judgment. While we are in
this world, we are exactly like him with
regard to love.
18 No fear exists where his love is.
Rather, perfect love gets rid of fear,
because fear involves punishment. The
person who lives in fear doesn’t have
perfect love.
19 We love because God loved us ﬁrst.
20 Whoever says, "I love God," but hates
another believer is a liar. People who
don’t love other believers, whom they
have seen, can’t love God, whom they
have not seen.1 JOHN 4 – 5
16
21 Christ has given us this
commandment: The person who
loves God must also love other believers.
1 Everyone who believes that Jesus
is the Messiah has been born from
God. Everyone who loves the Father also
loves his children.
2 We know that we love God’s children
when we love God by obeying his
commandments.
3 To love God means that we obey
his commandments. Obeying his
commandments isn’t diﬃcult
4 because everyone who has been born
from God has won the victory over the
world. Our faith is what wins the victory
over the world.
5 Who wins the victory over the world?
Isn’t it the person who believes that
Jesus is the Son of God?
6 This Son of God is Jesus Christ, who
came by water and blood. He didn’t
51 JOHN 5
17
come with water only, but with water
and with blood. The Spirit is the one
who veriﬁes this, because the Spirit is
the truth.
7 There are three witnesses:
8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood.
These three witnesses agree.
9 We accept human tes mony. God’s
tes mony is greater because it is the
tes mony that he has given about his
Son.
10 Those who believe in the Son of God
have the tes mony of God in them.
Those who don’t believe God have made
God a liar. They haven’t believed the
tes mony that God has given about his
Son.
11 This is the tes mony: God has given
us eternal life, and this life is found in his
Son.1 JOHN 5
18
12 The person who has the Son has this
life. The person who doesn’t have the
Son of God doesn’t have this life.
13 I’ve wri en this to those who believe
in the Son of God so that they will know
that they have eternal life.
14 We are conﬁdent that God listens
to us if we ask for anything that has his
approval.
15 We know that he listens to our
requests. So we know that we already
have what we ask him for.
16 If you see another believer
commi ng a sin that doesn’t lead to
death, you should pray that God would
give that person life. This is true for
those who commit sins that don’t lead to
death. There is a sin that leads to death.
I’m not telling you to pray about that.
17 Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet
there are sins that don’t lead to death.1 JOHN 5
19
18 We know that those who have been
born from God don’t go on sinning.
Rather, the Son of God protects them,
and the evil one can’t harm them.
19 We know that we are from God,
and that the whole world is under the
control of the evil one.
20 We know that the Son of God has
come and has given us understanding so
that we know the real God. We are in the
one who is real, his Son Jesus Christ. This
Jesus Christ is the real God and eternal
life.
21 Dear children, guard yourselves from
false gods.2 John
1
1 From the church leader. To the
chosen lady and her children, whom I
love because we share the truth. I’m not
the only one who loves you. Everyone
who knows the truth also loves you.
2 We love you because of the truth
which lives in us and will be with us
forever.
3 Good will, mercy, and peace will be
with us! They come from God the Father
and from Jesus Christ, who in truth and
love is the Father’s Son.
4 I was very happy to ﬁnd some of your
children living in the truth as the Father
has commanded us.
5 Dear lady, I’m now reques ng that
we con nue to love each other. It’s
not as though I’m wri ng to give you a2 JOHN 1
2
new commandment. Rather, from the
beginning we were commanded to love
each other.
6 Love means that we live by doing what
he commands. We were commanded
to live in love, and you have heard this
from the beginning.
7 Many people who deceive others
have gone into the world. They refuse to
declare that Jesus Christ came in ﬂesh
and blood. This is the mark of a deceiver
and an an christ.
8 Be careful that you don’t destroy what
we’ve worked for, but that you receive
your full reward.
9 Everyone who doesn’t con nue to
teach what Christ taught doesn’t have
God. The person who con nues to teach
what Christ taught has both the Father
and the Son.2 JOHN 1
10 If anyone comes to you and doesn’t
bring these teachings, don’t take him
into your home or even greet him.
11 Whoever greets him shares the evil
things he’s doing.
12 I have a lot to write to you. I would
prefer not to write a le er. Instead,
I hope to visit and talk things over
with you personally. Then we will be
completely ﬁlled with joy.
13 The children of your chosen sister
greet you.
33 John
1
1 From the church leader. To my dear
friend Gaius, whom I love because
we share the truth.
2 Dear friend, I know that you are
spiritually well. I pray that you’re doing
well in every other way and that you’re
healthy.
3 I was very happy when some believers
came and told us that you are living
according to the truth.
4 Nothing makes me happier than
to hear that my children are living
according to the truth.
5 Dear friend, you are showing your
faith in whatever you do for other
believers, especially when they’re your
guests.3 JOHN 1
2
6 These believers have told the
congrega on about your love. You will
do well to support them on their trip in
a way that proves you belong to God.
7 A er all, they went on their trip to
serve the one named Christ, and they
didn’t accept any help from the people
to whom they went.
8 We must support believers who go
on trips like this so that we can work
together with them in spreading the
truth.
9 I wrote a le er to the congrega on.
But Diotrephes, who loves to be in
charge, won’t accept us.
10 For this reason, when I come I will
bring up what he’s doing. He’s not
sa sﬁed with saying malicious things
about us. He also refuses to accept the
believers we send as guests. He even
tries to stop others who want to accept3 JOHN 1
3
them and a empts to throw those
people out of the congrega on.
11 Dear friend, never imitate evil, but
imitate good. The person who does good
is from God. The person who does evil
has never seen God.
12 Everyone, including the truth itself,
says good things about Demetrius. We
also say good things about him, and you
know that what we say is true.
13 I have a lot to write to you. However,
I would rather not write.
14 I hope to visit you very soon. Then
we can talk things over personally. Peace
be with you! Your friends here send you
their gree ngs. Greet each of our friends
by name.Jude

1 From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ
and brother of James. To those who
have been called, who are loved by God
the Father, and who are kept safe for
Jesus Christ.
2 May mercy, peace, and love ﬁll your
lives!
3 Dear friends, I had intended to write
to you about the salva on we share.
But something has come up. It demands
that I write to you and encourage you to
con nue your ﬁght for the Chris an faith
that was entrusted to God’s holy people
once for all me.
4 Some people have slipped in among
you unno ced. Not long ago they were
condemned in wri ng for the following
reason: They are people to whom GodJUDE 1
2
means nothing. They use God’s kindness
as an excuse for sexual freedom and
deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus
Christ.
5 I want to remind you about what
you already know: The Lord once saved
his people from Egypt. But on another
occasion he destroyed those who didn’t
believe.
6 He held angels for judgment on the
great day. They were held in darkness,
bound by eternal chains. These are the
angels who didn’t keep their posi on of
authority but abandoned their assigned
place.
7 What happened to Sodom and
Gomorrah and the ci es near them is
an example for us of the punishment
of eternal ﬁre. The people of these
ci es suﬀered the same fate that God’s
people and the angels did, because theyJUDE 1
3
commi ed sexual sins and engaged in
homosexual ac vi es.
8 Yet, in a similar way, the people who
slipped in among you are dreamers.
They contaminate their bodies with sin,
reject the Lord’s authority, and insult his
glory.
9 When the archangel Michael argued
with the devil, they were arguing over
the body of Moses. But Michael didn’t
dare to hand down a judgment against
the devil. Instead, Michael said, "May
the Lord reprimand you!"
10 Whatever these people don’t
understand, they insult. Like animals,
which are creatures of ins nct, they
use whatever they know to destroy
themselves.
11 How horrible it will be for them! They
have followed the path of Cain. They
have rushed into Balaam’s error to makeJUDE 1
4
a proﬁt. They have rebelled like Korah
and destroyed themselves.
12 These people are a disgrace at the
special meals you share with other
believers. They eat with you and don’t
feel ashamed. They are shepherds who
care only for themselves. They are dry
clouds blown around by the winds. They
are withered, uprooted trees without
any fruit. As a result, they have died
twice.
13 Their shame is like the foam on
the wild waves of the sea. They are
wandering stars for whom gloomy
darkness is kept forever.
14 Furthermore, Enoch, from the
seventh genera on a er Adam,
prophesied about them. He said, "The
Lord has come with countless thousands
of his holy angels.
15 He has come to judge all these
people. He has come to convict all theseJUDE 1
5
ungodly sinners for all the ungodly things
they have done and all the harsh things
they have said about him."
16 These people complain, ﬁnd fault,
follow their own desires, say arrogant
things, and ﬂa er people in order to
take advantage of them.
17 Dear friends, remember what the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ told you
to expect:
18 "In the last mes people who ridicule
God will appear. They will follow their
own ungodly desires."
19 These are the people who cause
divisions. They are concerned about
physical things, not spiritual things.
20 Dear friends, use your most holy faith
to grow. Pray with the Holy Spirit’s help.
21 Remain in God’s love as you look for
the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to
give you eternal life.JUDE 1
6
22 Show mercy to those who have
doubts.
23 Save others by snatching them from
the ﬁre of hell. Show mercy to others,
even though you are afraid that you
might be stained by their sinful lives.
24 God can guard you so that you don’t
fall and so that you can be full of joy
as you stand in his glorious presence
without fault.
25 Before me began, now, and for
eternity glory, majesty, power, and
authority belong to the only God, our
Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.Revela on

Lord God, the one who is, the one who

suﬀering, ruling, and endurance because
of Jesus. I was exiled on the island of
Patmos because of God’s word and the
tes mony about Jesus.REVELATION 1

10 I came under the Spirit’s power
on the Lord’s day. I heard a loud voice
behind me like a trumpet,
11 saying, "Write on a scroll what you
see, and send it to the seven churches:
Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thya ra,
Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."
12 I turned toward the voice which was
talking to me, and when I turned, I saw
seven gold lamp stands.
13 There was someone like the Son of
Man among the lamp stands. He was
wearing a robe that reached his feet. He
wore a gold belt around his waist.
14 His head and his hair were white
like wool–like snow. His eyes were like
ﬂames of ﬁre.
15 His feet were like glowing bronze
reﬁned in a furnace. His voice was like
the sound of raging waters.
16 In his right hand he held seven stars,
and out of his mouth came a sharp,REVELATION 1 – 2
4
two–edged sword. His face was like the
sun when it shines in all its brightness.
17 When I saw him, I fell down at his
feet like a dead man. Then he laid his
right hand on me and said, "Don’t be
afraid! I am the ﬁrst and the last,
18 the living one. I was dead, but now I
am alive forever. I have the keys of death
and hell.
19 Therefore, write down what you
have seen, what is, and what is going to
happen a er these things.
20 The hidden meaning of the seven
stars that you saw in my right hand and
the seven gold lamp stands is this: The
seven stars are the messengers of the
seven churches, and the seven lamp
stands are the seven churches.
1 "To the messenger of the church in
Ephesus, write: The one who holds
the seven stars in his right hand, the one
2REVELATION 2
5
who walks among the seven gold lamp
stands, says:
2 I know what you have done––how
hard you have worked and how you have
endured. I also know that you cannot
tolerate wicked people. You have tested
those who call themselves apostles but
are not apostles. You have discovered
that they are liars.
3 You have endured, suﬀered trouble
because of my name, and have not
grown weary.
4 However, I have this against you: The
love you had at ﬁrst is gone.
5 Remember how far you have fallen.
Return to me and change the way you
think and act, and do what you did at
ﬁrst. I will come to you and take your
lamp stand from its place if you don’t
change.REVELATION 2

6 But you have this in your favor––you
hate what the Nicolaitans are doing. I
also hate what they’re doing.
7 "Let the person who has ears listen
to what the Spirit says to the churches.
I will give the privilege of ea ng from
the tree of life, which stands in the
paradise of God, to everyone who wins
the victory.
8 "To the messenger of the church in
Smyrna, write: The ﬁrst and the last,
who was dead and became alive, says:
9 I know how you are suﬀering, how
poor you are––but you are rich. I also
know that those who claim to be Jews
slander you. They are the synagogue of
Satan.
10 Don’t be afraid of what you are going
to suﬀer. The devil is going to throw
some of you into prison so that you may
be tested. Your suﬀering will go on forREVELATION 2

ten days. Be faithful un l death, and I
will give you the crown of life.
11 Let the person who has ears listen
to what the Spirit says to the churches.
Everyone who wins the victory will never
be hurt by the second death.
12 "To the messenger of the church in
Pergamum, write: The one who holds
the sharp two–edged sword says:
13 I know where you live. Satan’s throne
is there. You hold on to my name and
have not denied your belief in me, even
in the days of An pas. He was my faithful
witness who was killed in your presence,
where Satan lives.
14 But I have a few things against you:
You have among you those who follow
what Balaam taught Balak. Balak trapped
the people of Israel by encouraging them
to eat food sacriﬁced to idols and to sin
sexually.REVELATION 2

15 You also have some who follow what
the Nicolaitans teach.
16 So return to me and change the way
you think and act, or I will come to you
quickly and wage war against them with
the sword from my mouth.
17 Let the person who has ears listen
to what the Spirit says to the churches.
I will give some of the hidden manna to
everyone who wins the victory. I will also
give each person a white stone with a
new name wri en on it, a name that is
known only to the person who receives
it.
18 "To the messenger of the church in
Thya ra, write: The Son of God, whose
eyes are like ﬂames of ﬁre and whose
feet are like glowing bronze, says:
19 I know what you do. I know your
love, faith, service, and endurance. I also
know that what you are doing now is
greater than what you did at ﬁrst.REVELATION 2

20 But I have something against you:
You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who
calls herself a prophet. She teaches and
misleads my servants to sin sexually and
to eat food sacriﬁced to idols.
21 I gave her me to turn to me and
change the way she thinks and acts, but
she refuses to turn away from her sexual
sins.
22 Watch me! I’m going to throw her
into a sickbed. Those who commit sexual
sins with her will also suﬀer a lot, unless
they turn away from what she is doing.
23 I will kill her children. Then all the
churches will know that I am the one
who searches hearts and minds. I will
reward each of you for what you have
done.
24 But the rest of you in Thya ra––all
who don’t hold on to Jezebel’s teaching,
who haven’t learned what are called theREVELATION 2 – 3

deep things of Satan––I won’t burden
you with anything else.
25 Just hold on to what you have un l I

26 I have received authority from my
Father. I will give authority over the

27 Those people will rule the na ons

28 I will also give them the morning star.
29 Let the person who has ears listen to
what the Spirit says to the churches.
1 "To the messenger of the church in
Sardis, write: The one who has God’s
seven spirits and the seven stars says:
I know what you have done. You are
known for being alive, but you are dead.
2 Be alert, and strengthen the things

have found that what you are doing has
not been completed in the sight of my
God.
3 So remember what you received and
heard. Obey, and change the way you
think and act. If you’re not alert, I’ll
come like a thief. You don’t know when I
will come.
4 But you have a few people in Sardis
who have kept their clothes clean.
They will walk with me in white clothes
because they deserve it.
5 Everyone who wins the victory this
way will wear white clothes. I will never
erase their names from the Book of Life.
I will acknowledge them in the presence
of my Father and his angels.

what the Spirit says to the churches.

strength, but you have paid a en on to
my word and have not denied my name.
9 I will make those who are in Satan’s

15
er these things I saw a door
standing open in heaven. I heard the
ﬁrst voice like a trumpet speaking to me.
It said, "Come up here, and I will show
you what must happen a er this."
2 Instantly, I came under the Spirit’s
power. I saw a throne in heaven, and
someone was si ng on it.
3 The one si ng there looked like gray
quartz and red quartz. There was a
rainbow around the throne which looked
like an emerald.
4 Around that throne were 24 other
thrones, and on these thrones sat 24
leaders wearing white clothes. They had
gold crowns on their heads.
5 Lightning, noise, and thunder came
from the throne. Seven ﬂaming torches
were burning in front of the throne.
These are the seven spirits of God.
6 In front of the throne, there was
something like a sea of glass as clear as
4REVELATION 4
16
crystal. In the center near the throne
and around the throne were four living
creatures covered with eyes in front and
in back.
7 The ﬁrst living creature was like a lion,
the second was like a young bull, the
third had a face like a human, and the
fourth was like a ﬂying eagle.
8 Each of the four living creatures had
six wings and were covered with eyes,
inside and out. Without stopping day or
night they were singing, "Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord God Almighty, who was, who
is, and who is coming."
9 Whenever the living creatures give
glory, honor, and thanks to the one who
sits on the throne, to the one who lives
forever and ever,
10 the 24 leaders bow in front of the
one who sits on the throne and worship
the one who lives forever and ever. TheyREVELATION 4 – 5
17
place their crowns in front of the throne
and say,
11 "Our Lord and God, you deserve to
receive glory, honor, and power because
you created everything. Everything came
into existence and was created because
of your will."
1 I saw a scroll in the right hand of
the one who sits on the throne. It
had wri ng both on the inside and on
the outside. It was sealed with seven
seals.
2 I saw a powerful angel calling out in a
loud voice, "Who deserves to open the
scroll and break the seals on it?"
3 No one in heaven, on earth, or under
the earth could open the scroll or look
inside it.
4 I cried bi erly because no one was
found who deserved to open the scroll
or look inside it.
5REVELATION 5
18
5 Then one of the leaders said to me,
"Stop crying! The Lion from the tribe of
Judah, the Root of David, has won the
victory. He can open the scroll and the
seven seals on it."
6 I saw a lamb standing in the center
near the throne with the four living
creatures and the leaders. The lamb
looked like he had been slaughtered. He
had seven horns and seven eyes, which
are the seven spirits of God sent all over
the world.
7 He took the scroll from the right hand
of the one who sits on the throne.
8 When the lamb had taken the scroll,
the four living creatures and the 24
leaders bowed in front of him. Each held
a harp and a gold bowl full of incense,
the prayers of God’s holy people.
9 Then they sang a new song, "You
deserve to take the scroll and open
the seals on it, because you wereREVELATION 5
19
slaughtered. You bought people with
your blood to be God’s own. They are
from every tribe, language, people, and
na on.
10 You made them a kingdom and
priests for our God. They will rule as
kings on the earth."
11 Then I heard the voices of many
angels, the four living creatures, and
the leaders surrounding the throne.
They numbered ten thousand mes
ten thousand and thousands mes
thousands.
12 In a loud voice they were singing,
"The lamb who was slain deserves
to receive power, wealth, wisdom,
strength, honor, glory, and praise."
13 I heard every creature in heaven,
on earth, under the earth, and on the
sea. Every creature in those places was
singing, "To the one who sits on theREVELATION 5 – 6
20
throne and to the lamb be praise, honor,
glory, and power forever and ever."
14 The four living creatures said,
"Amen!" Then the leaders bowed and
worshiped.
1 I watched as the lamb opened the
ﬁrst of the seven seals. I heard one
of the four living creatures say with a
voice like thunder, "Go!"
2 Then I looked, and there was a white
horse, and its rider had a bow. He was
given a crown and rode oﬀ as a warrior
to win ba les.
3 When the lamb opened the second
seal, I heard the second living creature
say, "Go!"
4 A second horse went out. It was ﬁery
red. Its rider was given the power to take
peace away from the earth and to make
people slaughter one another. So he was
given a large sword.
6REVELATION 6
21
5 When the lamb opened the third seal,
I heard the third living creature say,
"Go!" I looked, and there was a black
horse, and its rider held a scale.
6 I heard what sounded like a voice
from among the four living creatures,
saying, "A quart of wheat for a day’s pay
or three quarts of barley for a day’s pay.
But do not damage the olive oil and the
wine."
7 When the lamb opened the fourth
seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living
creature say, "Go!"
8 I looked, and there was a pale horse,
and its rider’s name was Death. Hell
followed him. They were given power
over one–fourth of the earth to kill
people using wars, famines, plagues, and
the wild animals on the earth.
9 When the lamb opened the ﬁ h seal,
I saw under the altar the souls of those
who had been slaughtered because ofREVELATION 6
22
God’s word and the tes mony they had
given about him.
10 They cried out in a loud voice, "Holy
and true Master, how long before you
judge and take revenge on those living
on earth who shed our blood?"
11 Each of the souls was given a white
robe. They were told to rest a li le
longer un l all their coworkers, the other
Chris ans, would be killed as they had
been killed.
12 I watched as the lamb opened the
sixth seal. A powerful earthquake struck.
The sun turned as black as sackcloth
made of hair. The full moon turned as
red as blood.
13 The stars fell from the sky to the
earth like ﬁgs dropping from a ﬁg tree
when it is shaken by a strong wind.
14 The sky vanished like a scroll being
rolled up. Every mountain and island was
moved from its place.REVELATION 6 – 7
23
15 Then the kings of the earth, the
important people, the generals, the rich,
the powerful, and all the slaves and
free people hid themselves in caves and
among the rocks in the mountains.
16 They said to the mountains and
rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the
face of the one who sits on the throne
and from the anger of the lamb,
17 because the frightening day of their
anger has come, and who is able to
endure it?"
1 A er this I saw four angels standing
at the four corners of the earth. They
were holding back the four winds of the
earth to keep them from blowing on the
land, the sea, or any tree.
2 I saw another angel coming from the
east with the seal of the living God. He
cried out in a loud voice to the four
angels who had been allowed to harm
the land and sea,
7REVELATION 7
24
3 "Don’t harm the land, the sea, or the
trees un l we have put the seal on the
foreheads of the servants of our God."
4 I heard how many were sealed:
144,000. Those who were sealed were
from every tribe of the people of Israel:
5 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were
sealed, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,
12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000
from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from
the tribe of Manasseh,
7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,
12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000
from the tribe of Issachar,
8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,
12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000
from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
9 A er these things I saw a large crowd
from every na on, tribe, people, and
language. No one was able to count how
many people there were. They wereREVELATION 7
25
standing in front of the throne and the
lamb. They were wearing white robes,
holding palm branches in their hands,
10 and crying out in a loud voice,
"Salva on belongs to our God, who sits
on the throne, and to the lamb!"
11 All the angels stood around the
throne with the leaders and the four
living creatures. They bowed in front of
the throne with their faces touching the
ground, worshiped God,
12 and said, "Amen! Praise, glory,
wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and
strength be to our God forever and ever!
Amen!"
13 One of the leaders asked me, "Who
are these people wearing white robes,
and where did they come from?"
14 I answered him, "Sir, you know." Then
he told me, "These are the people who
are coming out of the terrible suﬀering.REVELATION 7 – 8
26
They have washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the lamb.
15 That is why they are in front of the
throne of God. They serve him day and
night in his temple. The one who sits
on the throne will spread his tent over
them.
16 They will never be hungry or thirsty
again. Neither the sun nor any burning
heat will ever overcome them.
17 The lamb in the center near the
throne will be their shepherd. He will
lead them to springs ﬁlled with the water
of life, and God will wipe every tear from
their eyes."
1 When he opened the seventh seal,
there was silence in heaven for
about half an hour.
2 Then I saw the seven angels who
stand in God’s presence, and they were
given seven trumpets.
8REVELATION 8
27
3 Another angel came with a gold
incense burner and stood at the altar.
He was given a lot of incense to oﬀer on
the gold altar in front of the throne. He
oﬀered it with the prayers of all of God’s
people.
4 The smoke from the incense went up
from the angel’s hand to God along with
the prayers of God’s people.
5 The angel took the incense burner,
ﬁlled it with ﬁre from the altar, and threw
it on the earth. Then there was thunder,
noise, lightning, and an earthquake.
6 The seven angels who had the seven
trumpets got ready to blow them.
7 When the ﬁrst angel blew his trumpet,
hail and ﬁre were mixed with blood, and
were thrown on the earth. One–third of
the earth was burned up, one–third of
the trees were burned up, and all the
green grass was burned up.REVELATION 8
28
8 When the second angel blew
his trumpet, something like a huge
mountain burning with ﬁre was thrown
into the sea. One–third of the sea turned
into blood,
9 one–third of the creatures that were
living in the sea died, and one–third of
the ships were destroyed.
10 When the third angel blew his
trumpet, a huge star ﬂaming like a torch
fell from the sky. It fell on one–third of
the rivers and on the springs.
11 That star was named Wormwood.
One–third of the water turned into
wormwood, and many people died from
this water because it had turned bi er.
12 When the fourth angel blew his
trumpet, one–third of the sun, one–third
of the moon, and one–third of the stars
were struck so that one–third of them
turned dark. There was no light forREVELATION 8 – 9
29
one–third of the day and one–third of
the night.
13 I saw an eagle ﬂying overhead, and I
heard it say in a loud voice, "Catastrophe,
catastrophe, catastrophe for those living
on earth, because of the remaining
trumpet blasts which the three angels
are about to blow."
1 When the ﬁ h angel blew his
trumpet, I saw a star that had fallen
to earth from the sky. The star was given
the key to the sha of the bo omless
pit.
2 It opened the sha of the bo omless
pit, and smoke came out of the sha
like the smoke from a large furnace. The
smoke darkened the sun and the air.
3 Locusts came out of the smoke onto
the earth, and they were given power
like the power of earthly scorpions.
4 They were told not to harm any grass,
green plant, or tree on the earth. They
9REVELATION 9
30
could harm only the people who do not
have the seal of God on their foreheads.
5 They were not allowed to kill them.
They were only allowed to torture them
for ﬁve months. Their torture was like
the pain of a scorpion’s s ng.
6 At that me people will look for death
and never ﬁnd it. They will long to die,
but death will escape them.
7 The locusts looked like horses
prepared for ba le. They seemed to
have crowns that looked like gold on
their heads. Their faces were like human
faces.
8 They had hair like women’s hair and
teeth like lions’ teeth.
9 They had breastplates like iron. The
noise from their wings was like the roar
of chariots with many horses rushing
into ba le.REVELATION 9
10 They had tails and s
31
ngers like
scorpions. They had the power to hurt
people with their tails for ﬁve months.
11 The king who ruled them was the
angel from the bo omless pit. In Hebrew
he is called Abaddon, and in Greek he is
called Apollyon.
12 The ﬁrst catastrophe is over. A er
these things there are two more
catastrophes yet to come.
13 When the sixth angel blew his
trumpet, I heard a voice from the four
horns of the gold altar in front of God.
14 The voice said to the sixth angel
who had the trumpet, "Release the
four angels who are held at the great
Euphrates River."
15 The four angels who were ready for
that hour, day, month, and year were
released to kill one–third of humanity.REVELATION 9
32
16 The soldiers on horses numbered
20,000 mes 10,000. I heard how many
there were.
17 In the vision that I had, the horses
and their riders looked like this: The
riders had breastplates that were ﬁery
red, pale blue, and yellow. The horses
had heads like lions. Fire, smoke, and
sulfur came out of their mouths.
18 These three plagues––the ﬁre,
smoke, and sulfur which came out of
their mouths––killed one––third of
humanity.
19 The power of these horses is in their
mouths and their tails. (Their tails have
heads like snakes which they use to hurt
people.)
20 The people who survived these
plagues s ll did not turn to me and
change the way they were thinking and
ac ng. If they had, they would have
stopped worshiping demons and idolsREVELATION 9 – 10
33
made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and
wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk.
21 They did not turn away from
commi ng murder, prac cing
witchcra , sinning sexually, or stealing.
1 I saw another powerful angel
come down from heaven. He
was dressed in a cloud, and there was a
rainbow over his head. His face was like
the sun, and his feet were like columns
of ﬁre.
2 He held a small, opened scroll in his
hand. He set his right foot on the sea
and his le on the land.
3 Then he shouted in a loud voice as a
lion roars. When he shouted, the seven
thunders spoke with voices of their own.
4 When the seven thunders spoke, I
was going to write it down. I heard a
voice from heaven say, "Seal up what
the seven thunders have said, and don’t
write it down."
10REVELATION 10
34
5 The angel whom I saw standing on the
sea and on the land raised his right hand
to heaven.
6 He swore an oath by the one who
lives forever and ever, who created
heaven and everything in it, the earth
and everything in it, and the sea and
everything in it. He said, "There will be
no more delay.
7 In the days when the seventh angel is
ready to blow his trumpet, the mystery
of God will be completed, as he had
made this Good News known to his
servants, the prophets."
8 The voice which I had heard from
heaven spoke to me again. It said, "Take
the opened scroll from the hand of the
angel who is standing on the sea and on
the land."
9 I went to the angel and asked him to
give me the small scroll. He said to me,
"Take it and eat it. It will be bi er in yourREVELATION 10 – 11
35
stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey
in your mouth."
10 I took the small scroll from the angel’s
hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey
in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, it
was bi er in my stomach.
11 The seven thunders told me, "Again
you must speak what God has revealed
in front of many people, na ons,
languages, and kings."
1 Then I was given a s ck like
a measuring s ck. I was told,
"Stand up and measure the temple of
God and the altar. Count those who
worship there.
2 But do not measure the temple
courtyard. Leave that out, because it
is given to the na ons, and they will
trample the holy city for 42 months.
3 I will allow my two witnesses who
wear sackcloth to speak what God has
11REVELATION 11
36
revealed. They will speak for 1,260
days."
4 These witnesses are the two olive
trees and the two lamp stands standing
in the presence of the Lord of the earth.
5 If anyone wants to hurt them, ﬁre
comes out of the witnesses’ mouths and
burns up their enemies. If anyone wants
to hurt them, he must be killed the same
way.
6 These witnesses have authority to
shut the sky in order to keep rain from
falling during the me they speak what
God has revealed. They have authority
to turn water into blood and to strike the
earth with any plague as o en as they
want.
7 When the witnesses ﬁnish their
tes mony, the beast which comes from
the bo omless pit will ﬁght them,
conquer them, and kill them.REVELATION 11
37
8 Their dead bodies will lie on the street
of the important city where their Lord
was cruciﬁed. The spiritual names of
that city are Sodom and Egypt.
9 For 3½ days some members of the
people, tribes, languages, and na ons
will look at the witnesses’ dead bodies
and will not allow anyone to bury them.
10 Those living on earth will gloat over
the witnesses’ death. They will celebrate
and send gi s to each other because
these two prophets had tormented
those living on earth.
11 A er 3½ days the breath of life from
God entered the two witnesses, and
they stood on their feet. Great fear fell
on those who watched them.
12 The witnesses heard a loud voice
from heaven calling to them, "Come
up here." They went up to heaven in a
cloud, and their enemies watched them.REVELATION 11
38
13 At that moment a powerful
earthquake struck. One–tenth of the
city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed
by the earthquake, and the rest were
terriﬁed. They gave glory to the God of
heaven.
14 The second catastrophe is over. The
third catastrophe will soon be here.
15 When the seventh angel blew his
trumpet, there were loud voices in
heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the
world has become the kingdom of our
Lord and of his Messiah, and he will rule
as king forever and ever."
16 Then the 24 leaders, who were si ng
on their thrones in God’s presence,
immediately bowed, worshiped God,
17 and said, "We give thanks to you,
Lord God Almighty, who is and who
was, because you have taken your great
power and have begun ruling as king.REVELATION 11 – 12
18 The na
39
ons were angry, but your
anger has come. The me has come
for the dead to be judged: to reward
your servants, the prophets, your holy
people, and those who fear your name,
no ma er if they are important or
unimportant, and to destroy those who
destroy the earth."
19 God’s temple in heaven was opened,
and the ark of his promise was seen
inside his temple. There was lightning,
noise, thunder, an earthquake, and
heavy hail.
1 A spectacular sign appeared in
the sky: There was a woman who
was dressed in the sun, who had the
moon under her feet and a crown of 12
stars on her head.
2 She was pregnant. She cried out from
labor pains and the agony of giving birth.
3 Another sign appeared in the sky: a
huge ﬁery red serpent with seven heads,
12REVELATION 12
40
ten horns, and seven crowns on its
heads.
4 Its tail swept away one–third of the
stars in the sky and threw them down
to earth. The serpent stood in front of
the woman who was going to give birth
so that it could devour her child when it
was born.
5 She gave birth to a son, a boy, who
is to rule all the na ons with an iron
scepter. Her child was snatched away
and taken to God and to his throne.
6 Then the woman ﬂed into the
wilderness where God had prepared a
place for her so that she might be taken
care of for 1,260 days.
7 Then a war broke out in heaven.
Michael and his angels had to ﬁght a war
with the serpent. The serpent and its
angels fought.REVELATION 12
41
8 But it was not strong enough, and
there was no longer any place for them
in heaven.
9 The huge serpent was thrown down.
That ancient snake, named Devil and
Satan, the deceiver of the whole world,
was thrown down to earth. Its angels
were thrown down with it.
10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven,
saying, "Now the salva on, power,
kingdom of our God, and the authority
of his Messiah have come. The one
accusing our brothers and sisters, the
one accusing them day and night in the
presence of our God, has been thrown
out.
11 They won the victory over him
because of the blood of the lamb and
the word of their tes mony. They didn’t
love their life so much that they refused
to give it up.REVELATION 12
42
12 Be glad for this reason, heavens and
those who live in them. How horrible
it is for the earth and the sea because
the Devil has come down to them with
ﬁerce anger, knowing that he has li le
me le ."
13 When the serpent saw that it
had been thrown down to earth, it
persecuted the woman who had given
birth to the boy.
14 The woman was given the two wings
of the large eagle in order to ﬂy away
from the snake to her place in the
wilderness, where she could be taken
care of for a me, mes, and half a me.
15 The snake’s mouth poured out a river
of water behind the woman in order to
sweep her away.
16 The earth helped the woman by
opening its mouth and swallowing
the river which had poured out of the
serpent’s mouth.REVELATION 12 – 13
43
17 The serpent became angry with the
woman. So it went away to ﬁght with her
other children, the ones who keep God’s
commands and hold on to the tes mony
of Jesus.
1 [12:18] The serpent stood on
the sandy shore of the sea. I saw
a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten
horns, seven heads, and ten crowns on
its horns. There were insul ng names on
its heads.
2 The beast that I saw was like a leopard.
Its feet were like bear’s feet. Its mouth
was like a lion’s mouth. The serpent gave
its power, kingdom, and far–reaching
authority to the beast.
3 One of the beast’s heads looked like it
had a fatal wound, but its fatal wound
was healed. All the people of the world
were amazed and followed the beast.
4 They worshiped the serpent because
it had given authority to the beast. They
13REVELATION 13
44
also worshiped the beast and said, "Who
is like the beast? Who can ﬁght a war
with it?"
5 The beast was allowed to speak
arrogant and insul ng things. It was
given authority to act for 42 months.
6 It opened its mouth to insult God, to
insult his name and his tent––those who
are living in heaven.
7 It was allowed to wage war against
God’s holy people and to conquer them.
It was also given authority over every
tribe, people, language, and na on.
8 Everyone living on earth will worship
it, everyone whose name is not wri en
in the Book of Life. That book belongs to
the lamb who was slaughtered before
the crea on of the world.
9 If anyone has ears, let him listen:
10 If anyone is taken prisoner, he must
go to prison. If anyone is killed with a
sword, with a sword he must be killed.REVELATION 13
45
In this situa on God’s holy people need
endurance and conﬁdence.
11 I saw another beast come from the
earth, and it had two horns like a lamb.
It talked like a serpent.
12 The second beast uses all the
authority of the ﬁrst beast in its
presence. The second beast makes the
earth and those living on it worship
the ﬁrst beast, whose fatal wound was
healed.
13 The second beast performs
spectacular signs. It even makes ﬁre
come down from heaven to earth in
front of people.
14 It deceives those living on earth with
the signs that it is allowed to do in front
of the ﬁrst beast. It tells those living on
earth to make a statue for the beast who
was wounded by a sword and yet lived.
15 The second beast was allowed to put
breath into the statue of the ﬁrst beast.REVELATION 13 – 14
46
Then the statue of the ﬁrst beast could
talk and put to death whoever would
not worship it.
16 The second beast forces all people–
–important and unimportant people,
rich and poor people, free people and
slaves––to be branded on their right
hands or on their foreheads.
17 It does this so that no one may buy or
sell unless he has the brand, which is the
beast’s name or the number of its name.
18 In this situa on wisdom is needed.
Let the person who has insight ﬁgure out
the number of the beast, because it is a
human number. The beast’s number is
666.
1 I looked, and the lamb was
standing on Mount Zion. There
were 144,000 people with him who had
his name and his Father’s name wri en
on their foreheads.
14REVELATION 14
47
2 Then I heard a sound from heaven like
the noise of raging water and the noise
of loud thunder. The sound I heard was
like the music played by harpists.
3 They were singing a new song in front
of the throne, the four living creatures,
and the leaders. Only the 144,000
people who had been bought on earth
could learn the song.
4 These 144,000 virgins are pure. They
follow the lamb wherever he goes. They
were bought from among humanity as
the ﬁrst ones oﬀered to God and to the
lamb.
5 They’ve never told a lie. They are
blameless.
6 I saw another angel ﬂying overhead
with the everlas ng Good News to
spread to those who live on earth––to
every na on, tribe, language, and
people.REVELATION 14
48
7 The angel said in a loud voice, "Fear
God and give him glory, because the
me has come for him to judge. Worship
the one who made heaven and earth,
the sea and springs."
8 Another angel, a second one, followed
him, and said, "Fallen! Babylon the Great
has fallen! She has made all the na ons
drink the wine of her passionate sexual
sins."
9 Another angel, a third one, followed
them, and said in a loud voice, "Whoever
worships the beast or its statue, whoever
is branded on his forehead or his hand,
10 will drink the wine of God’s fury,
which has been poured unmixed into
the cup of God’s anger. Then he will be
tortured by ﬁery sulfur in the presence
of the holy angels and the lamb.
11 The smoke from their torture will go
up forever and ever. There will be no
rest day or night for those who worshipREVELATION 14
49
the beast or its statue, or for anyone
branded with its name."
12 In this situa on God’s holy people,
who obey his commands and keep their
faith in Jesus, need endurance.
13 I heard a voice from heaven saying,
"Write this: From now on those who die
believing in the Lord are blessed." "Yes,"
says the Spirit. "Let them rest from their
hard work. What they have done goes
with them."
14 Then I looked, and there was a white
cloud, and on the cloud sat someone
who was like the Son of Man. He had
a gold crown on his head and a sharp
sickle in his hand.
15 Another angel came out of the
temple. He cried out in a loud voice to
the one who sat on the cloud, "Swing
your sickle, and gather the harvest. The
me has come to gather it, because the
harvest on the earth is overripe."REVELATION 14
50
16 The one who sat on the cloud
swung his sickle over the earth, and the
harves ng of the earth was completed.
17 Another angel came out of the
temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp
sickle.
18 Yet another angel came from the
altar with authority over ﬁre. This angel
called out in a loud voice to the angel
with the sharp sickle, "Swing your sickle,
and gather the bunches of grapes from
the vine of the earth, because those
grapes are ripe."
19 The angel swung his sickle on the
earth and gathered the grapes from the
vine of the earth. He threw them into
the winepress of God’s anger.
20 The grapes were trampled in the
winepress outside the city. Blood ﬂowed
out of the winepress as high as a horse’s
bridle for 1,600 stadia.REVELATION 15
15
51
1 I saw another sign in heaven.
It was spectacular and amazing.
There were seven angels with the
last seven plagues which are the ﬁnal
expression of God’s anger.
2 Then I saw what looked like a sea
of glass mixed with ﬁre. Those who
had won the victory over the beast, its
statue, and the number of its name were
standing on the glassy sea. They were
holding God’s harps
3 and singing the song of God’s servant
Moses and the song of the lamb. They
sang, "The things you do are spectacular
and amazing, Lord God Almighty. The
way you do them is fair and true, King of
the Na ons.
4 Lord, who won’t fear and praise your
name? You are the only holy one, and
all the na ons will come to worship
you because they know about your fair
judgments."REVELATION 15 – 16
5A
52
er these things I looked, and I saw
that the temple of the tent containing
the words of God’s promise was open in
heaven.
6 The seven angels with the seven
plagues came out of the temple wearing
clean, shining linen with gold belts
around their waists.
7 One of the four living creatures gave
seven gold bowls full of the anger of
God, who lives forever and ever, to the
seven angels.
8 The temple was ﬁlled with smoke
from the glory of God and his power.
No one could enter the temple un l the
seven plagues of the seven angels came
to an end.
1 I heard a loud voice from the
temple saying to the seven
angels, "Pour the seven bowls of God’s
anger over the earth."
16REVELATION 16
53
2 The ﬁrst angel poured his bowl
over the earth. Horrible, painful sores
appeared on the people who had the
brand of the beast and worshiped its
statue.
3 The second angel poured his bowl
over the sea. The sea turned into blood
like the blood of a dead man, and every
living thing in the sea died.
4 The third angel poured his bowl over
the rivers and the springs. They turned
into blood.
5 Then I heard the angel of the water
say, "You are fair. You are the one who
is and the one who was, the holy one,
because you have judged these things.
6 You have given them blood to drink
because they have poured out the blood
of God’s people and prophets. This is
what they deserve."REVELATION 16
54
7 Then I heard the altar answer, "Yes,
Lord God Almighty, your judgments are
true and fair."
8 The fourth angel poured his bowl on
the sun. The sun was allowed to burn
people with ﬁre.
9 They were severely burned. They
cursed the name of God, who has the
authority over these plagues. They
would not change the way they think
and act and give him glory.
10 The ﬁ h angel poured his bowl on
the throne of the beast. Its kingdom
turned dark. People gnawed on their
tongues in anguish
11 and cursed the God of heaven for
their pains and their sores. However,
they would not stop what they were
doing.
12 The sixth angel poured his bowl on
the great Euphrates River. The water inREVELATION 16
55
the river dried up to make a road for the
kings from the east.
13 Then I saw three evil spirits like frogs
come out of the mouths of the serpent,
the beast, and the false prophet.
14 They are spirits of demons that do
miracles. These spirits go to the kings
of the whole world and gather them for
the war on the frightening day of God
Almighty.
15 "See, I am coming like a thief. Blessed
is the one who remains alert and doesn’t
lose his clothes. He will not have to go
naked and let others see his shame."
16 The spirits gathered the kings at the
place which is called Armageddon in
Hebrew.
17 The seventh angel poured his bowl
into the air. A loud voice came from the
throne in the temple, and said, "It has
happened!"REVELATION 16 – 17
56
18 There was lightning, noise, thunder,
and a powerful earthquake. There has
never been such a powerful earthquake
since humans have been on earth.
19 The important city split into three
parts, and the ci es of the na ons fell.
God remembered to give Babylon the
Great the cup of wine from his ﬁerce
anger.
20 Every island vanished, and the
mountains could no longer be seen.
21 Large, heavy hailstones fell from the
sky on people. The people cursed God
because the plague of hail was such a
terrible plague.
1 One of the seven angels who
held the seven bowls came and
said to me, "Come, I will show you the
judgment of that notorious pros tute
who sits on raging waters.
17REVELATION 17
57
2 The kings of the earth had sex with
her, and those living on earth became
drunk on the wine of her sexual sins."
3 Then the angel carried me by his
power into the wilderness. I saw a
woman si ng on a bright red beast
covered with insul ng names. It had
seven heads and ten horns.
4 The woman wore purple clothes,
bright red clothes, gold jewelry, gems,
and pearls. In her hand she was holding
a gold cup ﬁlled with detestable and evil
things from her sexual sins.
5 A name was wri en on her forehead.
The name was Mystery: Babylon the
Great, the Mother of Pros tutes and
Detestable Things of the Earth.
6 I saw that the woman was drunk with
the blood of God’s holy people and of
those who tes fy about Jesus. I was very
surprised when I saw her.REVELATION 17
58
7 The angel asked me, "Why are you
surprised? I will tell you the mystery of
the woman and the beast with the seven
heads and the ten horns that carries her.
8 "You saw the beast which once was,
is no longer, and will come from the
bo omless pit and go to its destruc on.
Those living on earth, whose names
were not wri en in the Book of Life
when the world was created, will be
surprised when they see the beast
because it was, is no longer, and will
come again.
9 "In this situa on a wise mind is
needed. The seven heads are seven
mountains on which the woman is
si ng.
10 They are also seven kings. Five of
them have fallen, one is ruling now, and
the other has not yet come. When he
comes, he must remain for a li le while.REVELATION 17
59
11 The beast that was and is no longer
is the eighth king. It belongs with the
seven kings and goes to its destruc on.
12 "The ten horns that you saw are ten
kings who have not yet started to rule.
They will receive authority to rule as
kings with the beast for one hour.
13 They have one purpose––to give
their power and authority to the beast.
14 They will go to war against the lamb.
The lamb will conquer them because he
is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those
who are called, chosen, and faithful are
with him."
15 The angel also said to me, "The
waters you saw, on which the pros tute
is si ng, are people, crowds, na ons,
and languages.
16 The ten horns and the beast you saw
will hate the pros tute. They will leave
her abandoned and naked. They will eat
her ﬂesh and burn her up in a ﬁre.REVELATION 17 – 18
60
17 God has made them do what he
wants them to do. So they will give their
kingdom to the beast un l God’s words
are carried out.
18 The woman you saw is the important
city which dominates the kings of the
earth."
1 A er these things I saw another
angel come from heaven. He had
tremendous power, and his glory lit up
the earth.
2 He cried out in a powerful voice,
"Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen!
She has become a home for demons.
She is a prison for every evil spirit, every
unclean bird, and every unclean and
hated beast.
3 All the na ons fell because of the
wine of her sexual sins. The kings of the
earth had sex with her. Her luxurious
wealth has made the merchants of the
earth rich."
18REVELATION 18
61
4 I heard another voice from heaven
saying, "Come out of Babylon, my
people, so that you do not par cipate
in her sins and suﬀer from any of her
plagues.
5 Her sins are piled as high as heaven,
and God has remembered her crimes.
6 Do to her what she has done. Give her
twice as much as she gave. Serve her a
drink in her own cup twice as large as
the drink she served others.
7 She gave herself glory and luxury.
Now give her just as much torture and
misery. She says to herself, ‘I’m a queen
on a throne, not a widow. I’ll never be
miserable.’
8 For this reason her plagues of death,
misery, and starva on will come in a
single day. She will be burned up in a
ﬁre, because the Lord God, who judges
her, is powerful.REVELATION 18
62
9 "The kings of the earth who had sex
with her and lived in luxury with her will
cry and mourn over her when they see
the smoke rise from her raging ﬁre.
10 Frightened by her torture, they will
stand far away and say, ‘How horrible,
how horrible it is for that important
city, the powerful city Babylon! In one
moment judgment has come to it!’
11 "The merchants of the earth cry and
mourn over her, because no one buys
their cargo anymore.
12 No one buys their cargo of gold,
silver, gems, pearls, ﬁne linen, purple
cloth, silk, bright red cloth, all kinds of
citron wood, ar cles made of ivory and
very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble,
13 cinnamon, spices, incense, perfume,
frankincense, wine, olive oil, ﬂour,
wheat, ca le, sheep, horses, wagons,
slaves (that is, humans).REVELATION 18
63
14 ’The fruit you craved is gone. All
your luxuries and your splendor have
disappeared. No one will ever ﬁnd them

15 "Frightened by her torture, the
merchants who had become rich by
selling these things will stand far away.
They will cry and mourn,
16 saying, ‘How horrible, how horrible
for that important city which was
wearing ﬁne linen, purple clothes, bright
red clothes, gold jewelry, gems, and
pearls.
17 In one moment all this wealth has
been destroyed!’ Every ship’s captain,
everyone who traveled by ship, sailors,
and everyone who made their living
from the sea stood far away.
18 When they saw the smoke rise from
her raging ﬁre, they repeatedly cried
out, ‘Was there ever a city as important
as this?’REVELATION 18
64
19 Then they threw dust on their heads
and shouted while crying and mourning,
‘How horrible, how horrible for that
important city. Everyone who had a ship
at sea grew rich because of that city’s
high prices. In one moment it has been
destroyed!’
20 "Gloat over it, heaven, God’s people,
apostles, and prophets. God has
condemned it for you."
21 Then a powerful angel picked up a
stone that was like a large millstone.
He threw it into the sea and said, "The
important city Babylon will be thrown
down with the same force. It will never
be found again.
22 The sound of harpists, musicians,
ﬂu sts, and trumpeters will never be
heard in it again. Skilled cra sman will

of a millstone will never be heard in it
again.REVELATION 18 – 19

23 Light from lamps will never shine in it

because all the na ons were deceived
by its witchcra .
24 "The blood of prophets, God’s
people, and everyone who had been
murdered on earth was found in it."
1 A er these things I heard what
sounded like the loud noise
from a large crowd in heaven, saying,
"Hallelujah! Salva on, glory, and power
belong to our God.
2 His judgments are true and fair. He
has condemned the notorious pros tute
who corrupted the world with her sexual
sins. He has taken revenge on her for the
blood of his servants."
3 A second me they said, "Hallelujah!
The smoke goes up from her forever and

19REVELATION 19
66
4 The 24 leaders and the 4 living
creatures bowed and worshiped God,
who was si ng on the throne. They said,
"Amen! Hallelujah!"
5 A voice came from the throne. It said,
"Praise our God, all who serve and fear
him, no ma er who you are."
6 I heard what sounded like the noise
from a large crowd, like the noise of
raging waters, like the noise of loud
thunder, saying, "Hallelujah! The Lord
our God, the Almighty, has become king.
7 Let us rejoice, be happy, and give him
glory because it’s me for the marriage
of the lamb. His bride has made herself
ready.
8 She has been given the privilege of
wearing dazzling, pure linen." This ﬁne
linen represents the things that God’s
holy people do that have his approval.
9 Then the angel said to me, "Write this:
‘Blessed are those who are invited to theREVELATION 19
67
lamb’s wedding banquet.’" He also told
me, "These are the true words of God."
10 I bowed at his feet to worship him.
But he told me, "Don’t do that! I am
your coworker and a coworker of the
Chris ans who hold on to the tes mony
of Jesus. Worship God, because the
tes mony of Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy!"
11 I saw heaven standing open. There
was a white horse, and its rider is named
Faithful and True. With integrity he
judges and wages war.
12 His eyes are ﬂames of ﬁre. On his
head are many crowns. He has a name
wri en on him, but only he knows what
it is.
13 He wears clothes dipped in blood,
and his name is the Word of God.
14 The armies of heaven, wearing pure,
white linen, follow him on white horses.REVELATION 19

15 A sharp sword comes out of his
mouth to defeat the na ons. He will rule
them with an iron scepter and tread the
winepress of the ﬁerce anger of God
Almighty.
16 On his clothes and his thigh he has a
name wri en: King of kings and Lord of
lords.
17 I saw an angel standing in the sun. He
cried out in a loud voice to all the birds
ﬂying overhead, "Come! Gather for the
great banquet of God.
18 Eat the ﬂesh of kings, generals,
warriors, horses and their riders, and all
free people and slaves, both important
or insigniﬁcant people."
19 I saw the beast, the kings of the
earth, and their armies gathered to wage
war against the rider on the horse and
his army.
20 The beast and the false prophet who
had done miracles for the beast wereREVELATION 19 – 20
69
captured. By these miracles the false
prophet had deceived those who had
the brand of the beast and worshiped its
statue. Both of them were thrown alive
into the ﬁery lake of burning sulfur.
21 The rider on the horse killed the rest
with the sword that came out of his
mouth. All the birds gorged themselves
on the ﬂesh of those who had been
killed.
1 I saw an angel coming down
from heaven, holding the key to
the bo omless pit and a large chain in
his hand.
2 He overpowered the serpent, that
ancient snake, named Devil and Satan.
The angel chained up the serpent for
1,000 years.
3 He threw it into the bo omless pit.
The angel shut and sealed the pit over
the serpent to keep it from deceiving the
na ons anymore un l the 1,000 years

4 I saw thrones, and those who sat on
them were allowed to judge. Then I saw
the souls of those whose heads had
been cut oﬀ because of their tes mony
about Jesus and because of the word of
God. They had not worshiped the beast
or its statue and were not branded on
their foreheads or hands. They lived and
ruled with Christ for 1,000 years.
5 The rest of the dead did not live un l
the 1,000 years ended. This is the ﬁrst

6 Blessed and holy are those who are

8 He will go out to deceive Gog and
Magog, the na ons in the four corners

They will be as numerous as the grains
of sand on the seashore.
9 I saw that they spread over the broad
expanse of the earth and surrounded
the camp of God’s holy people and the
beloved city. Fire came from heaven and
burned them up.
10 The devil, who deceived them, was
thrown into the ﬁery lake of sulfur,
where the beast and the false prophet
were also thrown. They will be tortured
day and night forever and ever.
11 I saw a large, white throne and the
one who was si ng on it. The earth and
the sky ﬂed from his presence, but no
place was found for them.
12 I saw the dead, both important and
unimportant people, standing in front
of the throne. Books were opened,REVELATION 20 – 21
72
including the Book of Life. The dead
were judged on the basis of what they
had done, as recorded in the books.
13 The sea gave up its dead. Death and
hell gave up their dead. People were
judged based on what they had done.
14 Death and hell were thrown into the
ﬁery lake. (The ﬁery lake is the second
death.)
15 Those whose names were not found
in the Book of Life were thrown into the
ﬁery lake.
1 I saw a new heaven and a new
earth, because the ﬁrst heaven
and earth had disappeared, and the sea
was gone.
2 Then I saw the holy city, New
Jerusalem, coming down from God out
of heaven, dressed like a bride ready for
her husband.
3 I heard a loud voice from the throne
say, "God lives with humans! God will
21REVELATION 21
73
make his home with them, and they will
be his people. God himself will be with
them and be their God.
4 He will wipe every tear from their
eyes. There won’t be any more death.
There won’t be any grief, crying, or
pain, because the ﬁrst things have
disappeared."
5 The one si ng on the throne said, "I
am making everything new." He said,
"Write this: ‘These words are faithful

6 He said to me, "It has happened! I am
the A and the Z, the beginning and the
end. I will give a drink from the fountain
ﬁlled with the water of life to anyone

7 Everyone who wins the victory will
inherit these things. I will be their God,

8 But cowardly, unfaithful, and
detestable people, murderers, sexualREVELATION 21

sinners, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars
will ﬁnd themselves in the ﬁery lake of
burning sulfur. This is the second death."
9 One of the seven angels who had the
seven bowls full of the last seven plagues
came to me and said, "Come! I will show
you the bride, the wife of the lamb."
10 He carried me by his power away to a
large, high mountain. He showed me the
holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven.
11 It had the glory of God. Its light was
like a valuable gem, like gray quartz, as
clear as crystal.
12 It had a large, high wall with 12 gates.
Twelve angels were at the gates. The
names of the 12 tribes of Israel were
wri en on the gates.
13 There were three gates on the east,
three gates on the north, three gates on
the south, and three gates on the west.REVELATION 21
75
14 The wall of the city had 12
founda ons. The 12 names of the 12
apostles of the lamb were wri en on
them.
15 The angel who was talking to me had
a gold measuring s ck to measure the
city, its gates, and its wall.
16 The city was square. It was as wide
as it was long. He measured the city
with the s ck. It was 12,000 stadia long.
Its length, width, and height were the
same.
17 He measured its wall. According to
human measurement, which the angel
was using, it was 144 cubits.
18 Its wall was made of gray quartz. The
city was made of pure gold, as clear as
glass.
19 The founda ons of the city wall were
beau fully decorated with all kinds of
gems: The ﬁrst founda on was grayREVELATION 21

quartz, the second sapphire, the third
agate, the fourth emerald,
20 the ﬁ h onyx, the sixth red quartz,
the seventh yellow quartz, the eighth
beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth green
quartz, the eleventh jacinth, and the
twel h amethyst.
21 The 12 gates were 12 pearls. Each
gate was made of one pearl. The street
of the city was made of pure gold, as
clear as glass.
22 I did not see any temple in it, because
the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are
its temple.
23 The city doesn’t need any sun or
moon to give it light because the glory of
God gave it light. The lamb was its lamp.
24 The na ons will walk in its light, and
the kings of the earth will bring their
glory into it.REVELATION 21 – 22
77
25 Its gates will be open all day. They
will never close because there won’t be
any night there.
26 They will bring the glory and wealth
of the na ons into the holy city.
27 Nothing unclean, no one who does
anything detestable, and no liars will
ever enter it. Only those whose names
are wri en in the lamb’s Book of Life will
enter it.
1 The angel showed me a river
ﬁlled with the water of life, as
clear as crystal. It was ﬂowing from the
throne of God and the lamb.
2 Between the street of the city and the
river there was a tree of life visible from
both sides. It produced 12 kinds of fruit.
Each month had its own fruit. The leaves
of the tree will heal the na ons.
3 There will no longer be any curse. The
