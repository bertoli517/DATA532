the most honoured men on earth?Isaiah 23.9–15
61
9 The LORD of Hosts planned it to prick
every noble's pride and humiliate all the
most honoured men on earth.
10 Take to the tillage of your fields, you
people of Tarshish; for your market is
lost.
11 The LORD has stretched out his
hand over the sea and made kingdoms
quake; he has decreed the destruction
of Canaan's marts.
12 He has said, You will be busy no
more, you, the sorely oppressed city of
Sidon. Though you make your escape
to Kittim, even there you will find no
respite.
13 Look at this land, the destined home
of ships! The Chaldaeans (this was the
people; it was not Assyria) erected
siege-towers, tore down its palaces, and
laid it in ruins.
14 Wail, you ships of Tarshish; for your
haven is destroyed.
15 From that day Tyre will be forgotten
for seventy years, the span of one king's
life. At the end of the seventy years her
plight will be that of the harlot in the
song:Isaiah 23.16–24.5
62
16 Take your lyre, walk about the city,
poor, forgotten harlot; touch the strings
sweetly, sing all your songs, make men
remember you once more.
17 At the end of seventy years the LORD
will turn again to Tyre; she will go back
to her old trade and hire herself out to
every kingdom on earth.
18 But the profits of her trading will be
dedicated to the LORD; they will not be
stored up or hoarded, but given to those
who worship the LORD, to purchase food
in plenty and fine apparel.
1 BEWARE, the LORD is about to
strip the earth, split it and turn it
upside down, and scatter its inhabitants!
2 There will be the same fate for priest
and people, for master and slave,
mistress and maid, seller and buyer,
borrower and lender, creditor and debtor.
3 The earth is empty and void and
stripped bare. For this is the word that
the LORD has spoken.
4 The earth dries up and withers, the
whole world wilts and withers, the
heights of the earth wilt.
5 The earth itself is desecrated by those
who live on it, for they have broken
24Isaiah 24.6–13
63
laws, disobeyed statutes, and violated
the everlasting covenant.
6 That is why a curse consumes
the earth and its inhabitants suffer
punishment, why the inhabitants of the
earth dwindle and only a few are left.
7 The new wine fails, the vines wilt, and
the revellers all groan in sorrow.
8 The merry beat of tambourines is
silenced, the shouts of revelry are
hushed, the joyful lyre is silent.
9 They drink wine but without songs;
liquor tastes bitter to the one who drinks
it.
10 The city is shattered and in chaos,
every house barred, that none may
enter.
11 In the streets there is a crying out for
wine; all joy has faded, and merriment
is banished from the land.
12 Nothing but desolation is left in the
city; its gates are smashed beyond
repair.
13 So it will be throughout the world
among the nations, as when an olive
tree is beaten and stripped at the end of
the vintage.Isaiah 24.14–20
64
14 People raise their voices and cry
aloud, acclaiming in the west the majesty
of the LORD.
15 Therefore let the LORD be glorified in
the eastern regions, and the name of the
LORD the God of Israel in the coasts and
islands of the sea.
16 From the ends of the earth we have
heard them sing, ascribing beauty to the
righteous nation. But I said: Depravity,
depravity! Woe betide me! Traitors deal
treacherously! They are double-dyed
traitors.
17 The hunter's scare, the pit, and the
trap threaten all you inhabitants of the
earth.
18 Whoever runs from the rattle of the
scare will fall into the pit, and whoever
climbs out of the pit will be caught in the
trap. The windows of heaven above are
opened and earth's foundations shake;
19 the earth is utterly shattered, it is
convulsed and reels wildly.
20 The earth lurches like a drunkard and
sways like a watchman's shelter; the
sins of its inhabitants weigh heavy on it,
and it falls, to rise no more.Isaiah 24.21–25.4
65
21 On that day the LORD will punish in
heaven the host of heaven, and on earth
the kings of the earth.
22 They are herded together, and packed
like prisoners in a dungeon, shut up in
jail, punished over many years.
23 The moon will grow pale and the sun
hide its face in shame; for the LORD of
Hosts has become king on Mount Zion
and in Jerusalem, and is revealed in his
glory to the elders of his people.
1 LORD, you are my God; I shall
exalt you, I shall praise your
name, for you have done wonderful
things, long-planned, certain and sure.
2 You have turned cities into heaps of
ruin, fortified towns into rubble; every
mansion in the cities is swept away,
never to be rebuilt.
3 For this many a cruel nation holds you
in honour, the cities of ruthless peoples
treat you with awe.
4 Truly you have been a refuge to the
poor, a refuge to the needy in their
distress, shelter from tempest, shade
from heat. For the blast of the ruthless
is like an icy storm
25Isaiah 25.5–11
66
5 or a scorching drought; you subdue
the roar of the foe, and the song of the
ruthless dies away.
6 On this mountain the LORD of Hosts
will prepare a banquet of rich fare for
all the peoples, a banquet of wines well
matured, richest fare and well-matured
wines strained clear.
7 On this mountain the LORD will
destroy that veil shrouding all the
peoples, the pall thrown over all the
nations.
8 He will destroy death for ever. Then
the Lord GOD will wipe away the tears
from every face, and throughout the
world remove the indignities from his
people. The LORD has spoken.
9 On that day the people will say: See,
this is our God; we have waited for him
and he will deliver us. This is the LORD
for whom we have waited; let us rejoice
and exult in his deliverance.
10 For the hand of the LORD will rest on
this mountain, but Moab will be trampled
where he stands, as straw is trampled in
the slush of a midden.
11 In it Moab will spread out his hands
as a swimmer spreads his hands toIsaiah 25.12–26.8
67
swim, but his pride will be sunk with
every stroke of his hands.
12 The LORD will overthrow the
high-walled defences, level them to the
ground, and bring them down to the
dust.
1 On that day this song will be
sung in Judah: We have a strong
city with walls and ramparts built for our
safety.
2 Open the gates! Let a righteous nation
enter, a nation that keeps faith!
3 LORD, you keep those of firm purpose
untroubled because of their trust in you.
4 Trust in the LORD for ever, for he is an
eternal rock.
5 He has brought low all who dwell high
in a towering city; he levels it to the
ground and lays it in the dust,
6 so that the oppressed and the poor
may tread it underfoot.
7 The path of the righteous is smooth,
and you, LORD, make level the way for
the upright.
8 We have had regard to the path
prescribed in your laws, your name and
your renown are our heart's desire.
26Isaiah 26.9–15
68
9 With all my heart I long for you in
the night, at dawn I seek for you; for,
when your laws prevail on earth, the
inhabitants of the world learn what
justice is.
10 The wicked are destroyed; they have
never learnt justice. Corrupt in a land
of honest ways, they are blind to the
majesty of the LORD.
11 LORD, your hand is lifted high, but
they do not see your zeal for your people
(let them see and be ashamed!); let the
fire reserved for your enemies consume
them.
12 LORD, you will bestow prosperity on
us; for in truth all our works are your
doing.
13 LORD our God, other lords than you
have been our masters, but you alone
do we invoke by name.
14 Those who are dead will not live
again, those in their graves will not rise:
you punished and destroyed them, and
wiped out all memory of them.
15 LORD, you have enlarged the nation,
enlarged it and won honour for yourself;
you have extended all the frontiers of
the country.Isaiah 26.16–21
69
16 In distress, LORD, we sought you
out, chastened by the whisper of your
rebuke.
17 As a woman with child cries out in
her pains when her time is near and she
is in labour, so were we because of you,
LORD.
18 We have been with child, we have
been in labour, but have given birth to
wind. We have achieved no victories for
the land, given birth to no one to inhabit
the world.
19 But your dead will live, their bodies
will rise again. Those who sleep in the
earth will awake and shout for joy; for
your dew is a dew of sparkling light, and
the earth will bring those long dead to
birth again.
20 Go, my people, enter your rooms,
and shut the doors after you; withdraw
for a little while, until the LORD's wrath
has passed.
21 The LORD is coming from his
dwelling-place to punish the inhabitants
of the earth for their sins; then the earth
will reveal the blood shed on it and hide
the slain no more.Isaiah 27.1–8
70
1 On that day the LORD with
27 his cruel sword, his mighty and
powerful sword, will punish Leviathan
that twisting sea serpent, that writhing
serpent Leviathan; he will slay the
monster of the deep.
2 On that day sing of the pleasant
vineyard.
3 I the LORD am its keeper, I water it
regularly, for fear its leaves should wilt.
Night and day I tend it,
4 but I get no wine. I would as soon
have briars and thorns. Then as if in
battle I would trample it down,
5 unless it grasps me as its refuge and
makes peace with me -- unless it makes
its peace with me.
6 In time to come Jacob's posterity
will take root and Israel will bud and
blossom, and they will fill the whole
earth with fruit.
7 Has the LORD struck them down as
he struck their enemies? Have they
been slaughtered as their attackers were
slaughtered?
8 His quarrel with Jerusalem ends by
driving her into exile, removing her by a
cruel blast like that of the east wind.Isaiah 27.9–28.1
71
9 This wipes out Jacob's iniquity, and
the removal of his sin has this result: he
pounds to chalk all the altar stones, and
no sacred poles or incense-altars are left
standing.
10 The fortified city is left solitary, a
homestead stripped bare, forsaken like a
wilderness; the calf grazes and lies down
there, and eats up every twig.
11 The boughs grow dry and snap off
and women come and light their fires
with them. They are a people without
sense; therefore their Maker will show
them no mercy, he who formed them will
show them no favour.
12 On that day the LORD will beat
out the grain, from the streams of the
Euphrates to the wadi of Egypt; but you
Israelites will be gathered one by one.
13 On that day a great trumpet will
be sounded, and those who are lost in
Assyria and those dispersed in Egypt
will come to worship the LORD on
Jerusalem's holy mountain.
1 ALAS for the proud garlands
of Ephraim's drunkards, fading
flowers, lovely in their beauty, on the
28Isaiah 28.2–7
72
heads of those who drip with perfumes,
on those who are overcome with wine!
2 The Lord has one at his bidding,
mighty and strong; like a sweeping
storm of hail, like a destroying tempest,
like a torrent of water in overwhelming
flood he will beat down on the land with
violence.
3 The proud garlands of Ephraim's
drunkards will be trampled underfoot.
4 The fading flowers, lovely in their
beauty, on those who drip with perfumes,
will be like early figs ripe before summer.
Whoever sees them plucks them, and
their bloom is gone while they lie in the
hand.
5 On that day the LORD of Hosts shall
be a lovely garland, a fair diadem for the
remnant of his people,
6 a spirit of justice for one who sits as a
judge, and of valour for those who repel
enemy attacks at the gate.
7 These also lose their way through
wine and are set wandering by strong
drink: priest and prophet lose their way
through strong drink and are befuddled
with wine; they are set wandering byIsaiah 28.8–15
73
strong drink, lose their way through
tippling, and stumble in judgement.
8 Every table is covered with vomit; filth
is everywhere.
9 Who is there that can be taught? Who
makes sense of what he hears? They are
babes newly weaned, just taken from
the breast.
10 A babble of meaningless noises, mere
sounds on every side!
11 So through barbarous speech and a
strange tongue the Lord will address this
people,
12 a people to whom he once said, This
is true rest; let the exhausted have rest.
This is repose, but they would not listen.
13 Now to them the word of the LORD
will be a babble of meaningless noises,
mere sounds on every side. And so, as
they walk, they will fall backwards, they
will be injured, trapped, and caught.
14 Therefore listen to the word of the
LORD, you arrogant rulers of this people
in Jerusalem.
15 You say, We have made a treaty with
Death and signed a pact with Sheol:
when the raging flood sweeps by, it willIsaiah 28.16–21
74
not touch us; for we have taken refuge
in lies and sheltered behind falsehood.
16 Therefore these are the words of the
Lord GOD: I am laying a stone in Zion, a
block of granite, a precious corner-stone
well founded; he who has faith will not
waver.
17 I shall use justice as a plumb-line and
righteousness as a plummet. Then hail
will sweep away your refuge of lies and
floodwaters carry away your shelter.
18 Your treaty with Death will be
annulled and your pact with Sheol will
not stand; the raging waters will sweep
by, and you will be like land overwhelmed
by flood.
19 As often as it sweeps by, it will take
you; daily, morning and night, it will
sweep by. When you understand what
you hear, it will mean sheer terror.
20 As the saying goes: The bed is too
short for a person to stretch, and the
blanket too narrow for a cover.
21 But the LORD will arise as he rose
on Mount Perazim and storm with rage
as he did in the vale of Gibeon to do
what he must do, how strange a deed;
to perform his task, an alien task!Isaiah 28.22–29
75
22 But now have done with your
arrogance, or your bonds will be
tightened; for I have heard destruction
decreed for the whole land by the Lord
GOD of Hosts.
23 Listen and hear what I say, attend
and hear my words.
24 Will the ploughman spend his whole
time ploughing, breaking up his ground
and harrowing it?
25 Does he not, once he has levelled
it, broadcast the dill and scatter the
cummin? Does he not put in the wheat
and barley in rows, and vetches along
the edge?
26 Does not his God instruct him and
train him aright?
27 Dill must not be threshed with a
threshing-sledge, nor the cartwheel
rolled over cummin; but dill is beaten
out with a rod, and cummin with a flail.
28 Grain is crushed, but not too long or
too finely; cartwheels rumble over it and
thresh it, but they do not grind it fine.
29 Even this knowledge comes from
the LORD of Hosts, whose counsel is
wonderful and whose wisdom is great.Isaiah 29.1–7
76
1 Woe betide Ariel! Ariel, the city
29 where David encamped. When
another year has passed, with its full
round of pilgrim-feasts,
2 then I shall reduce Ariel to sore straits.
There will be moaning and lamentation
when I make her my Ariel, my fire-altar.
3 I shall encircle you with my army, set
a ring of outposts all round you, and
erect siege-works against you.
4 You will be brought low, you will speak
out of the ground, and your words will
issue from the earth; your voice will
come ghostlike from the ground, and
your words will squeak out of the earth.
5 Yet the horde of your enemies will
crumble into dust, the horde of ruthless
foes will fly like chaff. Suddenly, all in an
instant,
6 punishment will come from the LORD
of Hosts with thunder and earthquake
and a great noise, with storm and
tempest and a flame of devouring fire.
7 The horde of all the nations warring
against Ariel, all who fight against her
with their siege-works, all who hem her
in, will fade as a dream, a vision of the
night.Isaiah 29.8–13
77
8 Like one who is hungry and dreams
that he is eating, but wakes to find
himself empty, or like one who is thirsty
and dreams that he is drinking, but
wakes to find himself faint with thirst,
so will it be with the horde of nations all
warring against Mount Zion.
9 If you confuse yourselves, you will
stay confused; if you blind yourselves,
you will stay blinded. Be drunk but not
with wine, reel but not with strong drink;
10 for the LORD has poured on you a
spirit of deep stupor; he has closed your
eyes (that is, the prophets), and muffled
your heads (they are the seers).
11 The prophetic vision of it all has
become for you like the words in a sealed
book. If you hand such a book to one
who can read and say, Pray read this, he
will answer, I cannot; it is sealed.
12 Give it to one who cannot read and
say, Pray read this; he will answer, I
cannot read.
13 Then the Lord said: Because this
people worship me with empty words
and pay me lip-service while their hearts
are far from me, and their religion is but
a human precept, learnt by rote,Isaiah 29.14–20
78
14 therefore I shall shock this people
yet again, adding shock to shock: the
wisdom of their wise men will vanish and
the discernment of the discerning will be
lost.
15 Woe betide those who seek to hide
their plans too deep for the LORD to see!
When their deeds are done in the dark
they say, Who sees us? Who knows of
us?
16 How you turn things upside down,
as if the potter ranked no higher than
the clay! Will the thing made say of its
maker, He did not make me? Will the pot
say of the potter, He has no skill?
17 In but a very short time Lebanon will
return to garden land and the garden
land will be reckoned as common as
scrub.
18 On that day the deaf will hear when
a book is read, and the eyes of the blind
will see out of impenetrable darkness.
19 The lowly will once again rejoice in
the LORD, and the poor exult in the Holy
One of Israel.
20 The ruthless will be no more, the
arrogant will cease to exist; those who
are quick to find mischief, those whoIsaiah 29.21–30.2
79
impute sins to others, or lay traps for
him who brings the wrongdoer into
court, or by falsehood deny justice to the
innocent -- all these will be cut down.
21 (29:20)
22 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD, the deliverer of Abraham, about
the house of Jacob: This is no time for
Jacob to be shamed, no time for his face
to grow pale;
23 for his descendants will hallow my
name when they see what I have done
in their midst. They will hold sacred the
Holy One of Jacob and regard Israel's
God with awe;
24 the confused will gain understanding,
and the obstinate accept instruction.
1 Woe betide the rebellious
children! says the LORD, who
make plans, but not of my devising, who
weave schemes, but not inspired by me,
so piling sin on sin.
2 Without consulting me they hurry
down to Egypt to seek shelter under
Pharaoh's protection, to take refuge
under Egypt's shadow.
30Isaiah 30.3–10
80
3 Pharaoh's protection will lead to
humiliation and refuge under Egypt's
shadow will bring you disgrace.
4 Though his officers are at Zoan and
his envoys reach as far as Hanes,
5 that unprofitable nation will leave
everyone in sorry plight; they will find
neither help nor profit, only humiliation
and contempt.
6 THE Beasts of the South: an oracle.
Through a land of hardship and distress,
of lioness and roaring lion, of sand-viper
and venomous flying serpent, they
convey their wealth on the backs of
donkeys and their treasures on camels'
humps to an unprofitable people.
7 Worthless and futile is the help of
Egypt; therefore have I given her this
name: Rahab Subdued.
8 Now in their sight write it on a tablet,
engrave it as an inscription that it may
be there in future days, a testimony for
all time to come.
9 They are a race of rebels, disloyal
children, children who refuse to listen to
the LORD's instruction.
10 They say to the seers, You are not to
see, and to those who have visions, DoIsaiah 30.11–16
81
not produce true visions for us; give us
smooth words and illusory visions.
11 Turn aside, leave the straight path,
and rid us of the Holy One of Israel.
12 Therefore these are the words of the
Holy One of Israel: You have rejected this
warning and put your trust in devious
and dishonest practices on which you
lean for support,
13 therefore you shall find this iniquity
like a crack running down a high wall,
which bulges out and suddenly, all in an
instant, comes crashing down.
14 It crashes and breaks like an earthen
jar shattered beyond repair, so that
among the fragments not a shard is
found to take an ember from the hearth,
or to scoop water from a pool.
15 These are the words of the Lord
GOD, the Holy One of Israel: In calm
detachment lies your safety, your
strength in quiet trust. But you would
have none of it;
16 No, you said, we shall take horse and
flee. Therefore you will be put to flight!
We shall ride apace, you said. Therefore
swift will be the pace of your pursuers!Isaiah 30.17–23
82
17 When a thousand flee at the challenge
of one, you will flee at the challenge of
five, until you are left solitary as a mast
on a mountaintop, a signal-post on a hill.
18 Yet the LORD is waiting to show you
his favour, and he yearns to have pity
on you; for the LORD is a God of justice.
Happy are all who wait for him!
19 People of Zion, dwellers in Jerusalem,
you will weep no more. The LORD will
show you favour and answer you when
he hears your cry for help.
20 The Lord may give you bread of
adversity and water of affliction, but he
who teaches you will no longer keep
himself out of sight, but with your own
eyes you will see him.
21 If you stray from the path, whether
to right or to left, you will hear a voice
from behind you sounding in your ears
saying, This is the way; follow it.
22 You will treat as things unclean
your silver-plated images and your
gold-covered idols; you will loathe them
like a foul discharge and call them filth.
23 The Lord will give rain for the seed
you sow in the ground, and as the
produce of your soil he will give youIsaiah 30.24–29
83
heavy crops. When that day comes your
cattle will graze in broad pastures;
24 the oxen and donkeys that plough
the land will be fed with well-seasoned
fodder, winnowed with shovel and fork.
25 On every high mountain and lofty hill
streams of water will flow, on the day of
massacre when fortresses fall.
26 The moon will shine as brightly as
the sun, and the sun with seven times
its wonted brightness, like seven days'
light in one, on the day when the LORD
binds up the broken limbs of his people
and heals the wounds inflicted on them.
27 See, the LORD himself comes from
afar, his anger blazing and his doom
heavy. His lips are charged with wrath
and his tongue is like a devouring fire.
28 His breath is like a torrent in spate,
to load the nations with an evil yoke. He
sieves out the nations for destruction;
he puts a bit in their mouths to lead the
peoples astray.
29 But for you there will be songs, as
on a night of a sacred pilgrim-feast, and
gladness of heart as if one marched to
the sound of the pipe on the way to theIsaiah 30.30–31.1
84
mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of
Israel.
30 Then the LORD will make his
voice heard in majesty and reveal his
arm descending in fierce anger with
devouring flames of fire, amid cloudburst
and tempests of rain and hail.
31 For at the voice of the LORD Assyria's
heart fails her, as she feels the stroke of
his rod;
32 tambourines, lyres, and shaking
sistrums will keep time with every stroke
of his rod, of the punishment which the
LORD inflicts on them.
33 Topheth was made ready long ago
(it, too, was prepared for Molech); its
fire-pit, made deep and broad, is a
blazing mass of logs, with the breath
of the LORD like a stream of brimstone
setting it ablaze.
1 Woe betide those who go down
to Egypt for help and rely upon
horses, who put their trust in chariots
because they are many, and in horsemen
because of their vast numbers, but do
not look to the Holy One of Israel or seek
guidance of the LORD!
31Isaiah 31.2–7
85
2 Yet he too in his wisdom can bring
trouble and he does not take back
his threats; he will rise up against
wrongdoers, against all who go to the
help of evildoers.
3 The Egyptians are mortals, not gods,
their horses are flesh, not spirit. When
the LORD stretches out his hand, the
helper will stumble and the one who is
helped will fall; both will perish together.
4 This is what the LORD has said to me:
As a lion or a young lion growls over
its prey when the shepherds are called
out in force, and it is not scared at their
shouting or daunted by their clamour, so
the LORD of Hosts will come down to do
battle on the heights of Mount Zion.
5 Like a hovering bird the LORD of
Hosts will be a shield over Jerusalem; he
will shield and deliver her, sparing and
rescuing her.
6 Israel, you have been deeply disloyal,
yet come back to him,
7 for on that day every one of you will
spurn the idols of silver and the idols of
gold which your own sinful hands have
made.Isaiah 31.8–32.6
86
8 Assyria will fall, but not by man's
sword; a sword that no mortal wields
will devour him. He will flee before the
sword, and his young warriors will be put
to forced labour;
9 officers will be helpless from terror and
captains powerless to flee. This is the
word of the LORD whose fire blazes in
Zion, whose furnace burns in Jerusalem.
1 A king will reign in righteousness
and his ministers rule with justice,
2 each of them a refuge from the wind
and a shelter from the storm. They will
be like runnels of water in dry ground,
like the shade of a great rock in a thirsty
land.
3 Then those who see will see clearly,
and those who hear will listen with care;
4 the impetuous mind will understand
and know, and the stammering tongue
will speak fluently and plainly.
5 The scoundrel will no longer be
thought noble, nor the villain considered
honourable;
6 for the scoundrel will speak like a
scoundrel hatching evil in his heart,
godless in all his conduct, and a liar to
the LORD; he starves the hungry of their
32Isaiah 32.7–14
87
food and deprives the thirsty of anything
to drink.
7 The villain's tactics are villainous and
he devises infamous plans to bring ruin
on the poor with his lies and deny justice
to the needy.
8 But he who is of noble mind forms
noble designs and in those designs he
stands firm.
9 You women who live at ease, listen
attentively to what I say; you daughters
without a care, mark my words.
10 You may be carefree now, but you
will be quaking at the turn of the year,
for the vintage will be a failure, with no
produce gathered in.
11 You women now at ease, be terrified;
tremble, you women without a care.
Strip yourselves bare, and put on a
loincloth of sacking.
12 Beat upon your breasts in mourning
for the pleasant fields and fruitful vines,
13 for my people's land with its yield of
thorns and briars, for every happy home
in the bustling city.
14 Mansions are forsaken and the
crowded streets deserted; citadel and
watch-tower are turned into open heath,Isaiah 32.15–33.2
88
for ever the delight of wild asses and
pasture for flocks,
15 until a spirit from on high is lavished
upon us. Then the wilderness will
become garden land and garden land will
be reckoned as common as scrub.
16 Justice will make its home in the
wilderness, and righteousness dwell in
the grassland;
17 righteousness will yield peace and
bring about quiet trust for ever.
18 Then my people will live in tranquil
country, dwelling undisturbed in peace
and security;
19 it will be cool on the slopes of the
forest then, and cities will lie peaceful in
the plain.
20 Happy will you be sowing everywhere
beside water and letting ox and donkey
roam freely.
1 Woe betide you, destroyer,
yourself undestroyed, betrayer
still unbetrayed! After all your destroying,
you will be destroyed; after all your
betrayals, you yourself will be betrayed.
2 LORD, show us your favour; our hope
is in you. Uphold us every morning, save
us when troubles come.
33Isaiah 33.3–10
89
3 At the crack of thunder peoples flee,
nations are scattered at your roar;
4 they are stripped of spoil as if stripped
by young locusts, like a swarm of locusts
folk swarm over it.
5 The LORD is supreme, for he dwells
on high; he has filled Zion with justice
and righteousness.
6 Her strength will be in your unchanging
stability, her deliverance in wisdom and
knowledge; her treasure is the fear of
the LORD.
7 Listen, how the valiant cry out aloud
for help, and envoys sent to sue for
peace weep bitterly!
8 The highways are deserted, no one
travels the roads. Covenants are broken,
treaties are flouted; no one is held of
any account.
9 The land is parched and wilting,
Lebanon is eroded and crumbling;
Sharon has become like a desert, Bashan
and Carmel are stripped bare.
10 Now I shall arise, says the LORD;
now I shall exalt myself, now lift myself
up.Isaiah 33.11–18
90
11 You will conceive chaff, and bring
forth stubble; a wind like fire will devour
you.
12 Whole nations will be heaps of white
ash, or like thorns cut down and set on
fire.
13 You dwellers afar off, hear what I
have done; acknowledge my might, you
that are near at hand.
14 Sinners in Zion quake with terror, the
godless are seized with trembling; they
ask, Can any of us live with a devouring
fire? Can any of us live in perpetual
flames?
15 The person who behaves uprightly
and speaks the truth, who scorns to
enrich himself by extortion, who keeps
his hands clean from bribery, who stops
his ears against talk of murder and
closes his eyes against looking at evil --
16 he it is who will dwell on the heights,
his refuge a fastness in the cliffs, his food
assured and water never failing him.
17 Your eyes will see a king in his
splendour and look on a land stretching
into the distance.
18 You will call to mind what once you
feared: Where then is he that reckoned,Isaiah 33.19–24
91
where is he that weighed, where is he
that counted the treasures?
19 You will no longer see that barbarous
people, that people whose language was
so obscure, whose stuttering speech you
could not comprehend.
20 Look to Zion, city of our sacred
feasts, let your eyes rest on Jerusalem,
a secure abode, a tent that will never be
moved, whose pegs will never be pulled
up, whose ropes will none of them be
snapped.
21 There we have the LORD in all his
majesty in a place of rivers and broad
streams; but no galleys will be rowed
there, no stately ships sail by.
22 The LORD is our judge, the LORD our
lawgiver, the LORD our king -- he it is
who will save us.
23 (It may be said, Your rigging is slack;
it will not hold the mast firm in its socket,
nor can it spread the sails.) Then the
blind will have a full share of the spoil
and the lame will take part in the pillage.
24 No one dwelling there will say, I am
sick; the sins of the people who live
there will be pardoned.Isaiah 34.1–7
92
1 APPROACH, you nations, and
34 listen; attend, you peoples; let
the earth listen and everything in it, the
world and all that it yields;
2 for the LORD's anger is against all the
nations and his wrath against all their
hordes; he gives them over to slaughter
and destruction.
3 Their slain will be flung out, stench
will rise from their corpses, and the
mountains will run with their blood.
4 All the host of heaven will crumble into
nothing, the heavens will be rolled up
like a scroll, and all their host fade away,
as the foliage withers from the vine and
the ripened fruit from the fig tree.
5 For my sword appears in heaven. See
how it descends in judgement on Edom,
on a people whom I have doomed to
destruction.
6 The LORD has a sword sated with
blood, gorged with fat, the fat of rams'
kidneys, and with the blood of lambs
and goats; for the LORD has a sacrifice
in Bozrah, a great slaughter in Edom.
7 Wild oxen will go down also, bull and
bison together, and their land will drinkIsaiah 34.8–14
93
deep of blood and their soil be enriched
with fat.
8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance,
the champion of Zion has a time of
retribution.
9 Edom's torrents will be turned to pitch
and its soil to brimstone; the land will
become blazing pitch,
10 never to be quenched night or day;
smoke will rise from it for ever. Age after
age it will lie waste, and no one will ever
again pass through it.
11 Horned owl and bustard will make
it their home; it will be the haunt of
screech-owl and raven. The LORD has
stretched over it a measuring line of
chaos, and its boundaries will be a
jumble of stones.
12 No king will be acclaimed there, and
all its princes will come to naught.
13 Its palaces will be overgrown with
thorns; nettles and briars will cover its
strongholds. It will be the lair of wolves,
the haunt of desert-owls.
14 Marmots will live alongside jackals,
and he-goats will congregate there.
There too the nightjar will return to rest
and find herself a place for repose;Isaiah 34.15–35.3
94
15 there the sand-partridge will make
her nest, lay her eggs and hatch them,
and gather her brood under her wings;
there will the kites gather, each with its
mate.
16 Consult the book of the LORD and
read it: not one of these will be missing,
not one will lack its mate, for with his
own mouth he has ordered it and by his
spirit he has brought them together.
17 He it is who has allotted each its
place, and his hand has measured out
their portions; they will occupy it for all
time, and each succeeding generation
will dwell there.
1 Let the wilderness and the
parched land be glad, let the
desert rejoice and burst into flower.
2 Let it flower with fields of asphodel,
let it rejoice and shout for joy. The glory
of Lebanon is given to it, the splendour
too of Carmel and Sharon; these will see
the glory of the LORD, the splendour of
our God.
3 Brace the arms that are limp, steady
the knees that give way;
35Isaiah 35.4–10
95
4 say to the anxious, Be strong, fear
not! Your God comes to save you with
his vengeance and his retribution.
5 Then the eyes of the blind will be
opened, and the ears of the deaf
unstopped.
6 Then the lame will leap like deer, and
the dumb shout aloud; for water will
spring up in the wilderness and torrents
flow in the desert.
7 The mirage will become a pool, the
thirsty land bubbling springs; instead
of reeds and rushes, grass will grow in
country where wolves have their lairs.
8 And a causeway will appear there; it
will be called the Way of Holiness. No
one unclean will pass along it; it will
become a pilgrim's way, and no fool will
trespass on it.
9 No lion will come there, no savage
beast go by; not one will be found there.
But by that way those the LORD has
redeemed will return.
10 The LORD's people, set free, will
come back and enter Zion with shouts of
triumph, crowned with everlasting joy.
Gladness and joy will come upon them,
while suffering and weariness flee away.Isaiah 36.1–6
96
1 IN the fourteenth year of
36 King Hezekiah's reign, King
Sennacherib of Assyria attacked and
captured all the fortified towns of Judah.
2 From Lachish he sent his chief officer
with a strong force to King Hezekiah
at Jerusalem. The officer halted by
the conduit of the Upper Pool on the
causeway leading to the Fuller's Field.
3 There Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the
comptroller of the household, came out
to him, with Shebna the adjutant-general
and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary of
state.
4 The chief officer said to them, Tell
Hezekiah that this is the message of the
Great King, the king of Assyria: What
ground have you for this confidence of
yours?
5 Do you think words can take the place
of skill and military strength? On whom
then do you rely for support in your
rebellion against me?
6 On Egypt? Egypt is a splintered cane
that will run into a man's hand and
pierce it if he leans on it. That is what
Pharaoh king of Egypt proves to all who
rely on him.Isaiah 36.7–12
97
7 And if you tell me that you are relying
on the LORD your God, is he not the god
whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has
suppressed, telling Judah and Jerusalem
they must worship at this altar?
8 Now, make a deal with my master
the king of Assyria: I shall give you two
thousand horses if you can find riders for
them.
9 How then can you reject the authority
of even the least of my master's servants
and rely on Egypt for chariots and
horsemen?
10 Do you think that I have come to
attack this land and destroy it without
the consent of the LORD? No; the LORD
himself said to me, Go up and destroy
this land.
11 Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to
the chief officer, Please speak to us in
Aramaic, for we understand it; do not
speak Hebrew to us within earshot of the
people on the city wall.
12 The chief officer answered, Is it to
your master and to you that my master
has sent me to say this? Is it not to the
people sitting on the wall who, like you,Isaiah 36.13–18
98
will have to eat their own dung and drink
their own urine?
13 Then he stood and shouted in
Hebrew, Hear the message of the Great
King, the king of Assyria!
14 These are the king's words: Do not
be taken in by Hezekiah. He is powerless
to save you.
15 Do not let him persuade you to rely
on the LORD, and tell you that the LORD
will surely save you and that this city
will never be surrendered to the king of
Assyria.
16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this
is what the king of Assyria says: Make
your peace with me, and surrender. Then
every one of you will eat the fruit of his
own vine and of his own fig tree, and
drink the water of his own cistern,
17 until I come and take you to a land
like your own, a land of grain and new
wine, of bread and vineyards.
18 Beware that Hezekiah does not
mislead you by telling you that the LORD
will save you. Did any god of the nations
save his land from the king of Assyria's
power?Isaiah 36.19–37.2
99
19 Where are the gods of Hamath
and Arpad? Where are the gods of
Sepharvaim? Where are the gods of
Samaria? Did they save Samaria from
me?
20 Among all the gods of these nations is
there one who saved his land from me?
So how is the LORD to save Jerusalem?
21 The people remained silent and said
not a word in reply, for the king had
given orders that no one was to answer
him.
22 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, comptroller
of the household, Shebna the adjutant-
general, and Joah son of Asaph,
secretary, came to Hezekiah with their
clothes torn and reported the words of
the chief officer.
1 When King Hezekiah heard their
report, he tore his clothes, put on
sackcloth, and went into the house of
the LORD.
2 He sent Eliakim comptroller of the
household, Shebna the adjutant-general,
and the senior priests, all wearing
sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of
Amoz,
37Isaiah 37.3–8
100
3 to give him this message from the
king: Today is a day of trouble for us, a
day of reproof and contumely. We are
like a woman who lacks the strength to
bring to birth the child she is carrying.
4 It may be that the LORD your God
will give heed to the words of the chief
officer whom his master the king of
Assyria sent to taunt the living God, and
will confute the words which the LORD
your God heard. Offer a prayer for those
who still survive.
5 When King Hezekiah's officials came
to Isaiah,
6 they were given this answer for
their master: Here is the word of the
LORD: Do not be alarmed at what you
heard when the Assyrian king's minions
blasphemed me.
7 I shall sap his morale till at a mere
rumour he will withdraw to his own
country; and there I shall make him fall
by the sword.
8 Meanwhile the chief officer went
back, and, having heard that the king of
Assyria had moved camp from Lachish,
he found him attacking Libnah.Isaiah 37.9–16
101
9 But when the king learnt that King
Tirhakah of Cush was on the way
to engage him in battle, he sent
messengers again to King Hezekiah of
Judah
10 to say to him, How can you be
deluded by your God on whom you rely
when he promises that Jerusalem will
not fall into the hands of the king of
Assyria?
11 You yourself must have heard what
the kings of Assyria have done to all
countries: they utterly destroyed them.
Can you then hope to escape?
12 Did their gods save the nations which
my predecessors wiped out: Gozan,
Harran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden
living in Telassar?
13 Where are the kings of Hamath, of
Arpad, and of Lahir, Sepharvaim, Hena,
and Ivvah?
14 Hezekiah received the letter from the
messengers and, having read it, he went
up to the temple and spread it out before
the LORD
15 with this prayer:
16 LORD of Hosts, God of Israel,
enthroned on the cherubim, you aloneIsaiah 37.17–22
102
are God of all the kingdoms of the world;
you made heaven and earth.
17 Incline your ear, LORD, and listen;
open your eyes, LORD, and see; hear all
the words that Sennacherib has sent to
taunt the living God.
18 LORD, it is true that the kings of
Assyria have laid waste every country,
19 and have consigned their gods to the
flames. They destroyed them, because
they were no gods but the work of men's
hands, mere wood and stone.
20 Now, LORD our God, save us from his
power, so that all the kingdoms of the
earth may know that you alone, LORD,
are God.
21 Isaiah son of Amoz sent Hezekiah
the following message: This is the word
of the LORD the God of Israel: I have
heard your prayer to me concerning King
Sennacherib of Assyria,
22 and this is the word which the
LORD has spoken against him: The
virgin daughter of Zion disdains you,
she laughs you to scorn; the daughter
of Jerusalem tosses her head as you
retreat.Isaiah 37.23–28
103
23 Whom have you taunted and
blasphemed? Against whom did you
raise an outcry, casting haughty glances
at the Holy One of Israel?
24 You sent your servants to taunt
the Lord; you said: With my countless
chariots I have ascended the mountain
heights, gone to the remote recesses of
Lebanon. I have felled its tallest cedars,
the finest of its pines; I have reached the
highest peak, the most luxuriant forest.
25 I have dug wells and drunk the
waters of a foreign land, and with the
sole of my foot I have dried up all the
streams of Egypt.
26 Have you not heard? Long ago I did it
all. In days gone by I planned it and now
I have brought it about, till your fortified
cities have crashed into heaps of rubble.
27 Their inhabitants, shorn of strength,
disheartened and put to shame, were
but as plants in the field, frail as green
herbs, as grass on the rooftops blasted
by the east wind.
28 I know your rising up and your sitting
down, your going out and your coming
in.Isaiah 37.29–34
104
29 The frenzy of your rage against me
and your arrogance have come to my
ears. I shall put a ring in your nose and
a bridle in your mouth, and I shall take
you back by the way on which you came.
30 This will be the sign for you: this year
you will eat the leavings of the grain and
in the second year what is self-sown; but
in the third year you will sow and reap,
plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
31 The survivors left in Judah will strike
fresh root below ground and yield fruit
above ground,
32 for a remnant will come out of
Jerusalem and survivors from Mount
Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will
perform this.
33 Therefore, this is the word of the
LORD about the king of Assyria: He will
not enter this city or shoot an arrow
there; he will not advance against it
with his shield or cast up a siege-ramp
against it.
34 By the way he came he will go back;
he will not enter this city. This is the
word of the LORD.Isaiah 37.35–38.3
105
35 I shall shield this city to deliver it for
my own sake and for the sake of my
servant David.
36 The angel of the LORD went out and
struck down a hundred and eighty-five
thousand men in the Assyrian camp;
when morning dawned, there they all lay
dead.
37 King Sennacherib of Assyria broke
camp and marched away; he went back
to Nineveh and remained there.
38 One day, while he was worshipping in
the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons
Adrammelech and Sharezer assassinated
him and made their escape to the land
of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded
him.
1 At this time Hezekiah became
mortally ill, and the prophet
Isaiah son of Amoz came to him with
this message from the LORD: Give your
last instructions to your household, for
you are dying; you will not recover.
2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
and offered this prayer to the LORD:
3 LORD, remember how I have lived
before you, faithful and loyal in your
38Isaiah 38.4–11
106
service, always doing what was pleasing
to you. And he wept bitterly.
4 Then the word of the LORD came to
Isaiah:
5 Go and say to Hezekiah: This is the
word of the LORD the God of your father
David: I have heard your prayer and
seen your tears; I am going to add
fifteen years to your life,
6 and I shall deliver you and this city
from the king of Assyria. I shall protect
this city.
7 Isaiah replied, This will be your proof
from the LORD that he will do what he
has promised:
8 I shall bring back by ten steps the
shadow cast by the setting sun on the
stairway of Ahaz. And the sun went back
ten steps on the stairway down which it
had gone.
9 A poem written by King Hezekiah of
Judah on his recovery from his illness:
10 I said, In the prime of life I must
pass away; for the rest of my days I am
consigned to the gates of Sheol.
11 I said, I shall no longer see the LORD
as I did in the land of the living; I shallIsaiah 38.12–18
107
no longer see my fellow-men as I did
when I lived in the world.
12 My dwelling is taken from me, pulled
up like a shepherd's tent; you have
rolled up my life like a weaver when he
cuts the web from the thrum. Day and
night you torment me;
13 I am racked with pain till the morning.
All my bones are broken, as if by a lion;
day and night you torment me.
14 I twitter as if I were a swallow, I
moan like a dove. My eyes are raised to
heaven: Lord, pay heed; stand surety
for me.
15 How can I complain, what can I say
to the LORD when he himself has done
this? I shall wander to and fro all my life
long in bitterness of soul.
16 Yet, Lord, because of you my soul will
live. Give my spirit rest; restore me and
give me life.
17 Bitterness, not prosperity, had indeed
been my lot, but your love saved me
from the pit of destruction; for you have
thrust all my sins behind you.
18 Sheol cannot confess you, Death
cannot praise you, nor can those who go
down to the abyss hope for your truth.Isaiah 38.19–39.3
108
19 The living, only the living can confess
you as I do this day, my God, just as a
father makes your faithfulness known to
his sons.
20 The LORD is at hand to save me; so
let the music of our praises resound all
our life long in the house of the LORD.
21 Isaiah told them to prepare a
fig-plaster; when it was made and
applied to the inflammation, Hezekiah
recovered.
22 He asked Isaiah what proof there was
that he would go up to the house of the
LORD.
1 At that time the king of
Babylon, Merodach-baladan son
of Baladan, sent envoys with a gift to
Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been
ill.
2 Hezekiah welcomed them and showed
them his treasury, the silver and gold,
the spices and fragrant oil, his entire
armoury and everything to be found in
his storehouses; there was nothing in
his palace or in his whole realm that
Hezekiah did not show them.
3 The prophet Isaiah came to King
Hezekiah and asked, What did these
39Isaiah 39.4–40.2
109
men say? Where did they come from?
They came to me from a distant country,
Hezekiah answered, from Babylon.
4 What did they see in your palace?
Isaiah demanded. They saw everything,
was the reply; there was nothing in my
storehouses that I did not show them.
5 Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word
of the LORD of Hosts:
6 The time is coming, says the LORD,
when everything in your palace, and all
that your forefathers have amassed till
the present day, will be carried away to
Babylon; not a thing will be left.
7 And some of your sons, your own
offspring, will be taken to serve as
eunuchs in the palace of the king of
Babylon.
8 Hezekiah answered, The word of the
LORD which you have spoken is good,
for he was thinking to himself that peace
and security would last his lifetime.
1 COMFORT my people; bring
comfort to them, says your God;
2 speak kindly to Jerusalem and
proclaim to her that her term of bondage
is served, her penalty is paid; for she
40Isaiah 40.3–9
110
has received at the LORD's hand double
measure for all her sins.
3 A voice cries: Clear a road through
the wilderness for the LORD, prepare a
highway across the desert for our God.
4 Let every valley be raised, every
mountain and hill be brought low,
uneven ground be made smooth, and
steep places become level.
5 Then will the glory of the LORD be
revealed and all mankind together will
see it. The LORD himself has spoken.
6 A voice says, Proclaim! and I asked,
What shall I proclaim? All mortals are
grass, they last no longer than a wild
flower of the field.
7 The grass withers, the flower fades,
when the blast of the LORD blows on
them. Surely the people are grass!
8 The grass may wither, the flower fade,
but the word of our God will endure for
ever.
9 Climb to a mountaintop, you that bring
good news to Zion; raise your voice and
shout aloud, you that carry good news
to Jerusalem, raise it fearlessly; say to
the cities of Judah, Your God is here!Isaiah 40.10–16
111
10 Here is the Lord GOD; he is coming in
might, coming to rule with powerful arm.
His reward is with him, his recompense
before him.
11 Like a shepherd he will tend his flock
and with his arm keep them together;
he will carry the lambs in his bosom and
lead the ewes to water.
12 WHO has measured the waters of the
sea in the hollow of his hand, or with
its span gauged the heavens? Who has
held all the soil of the earth in a bushel,
or weighed the mountains on a balance,
the hills on a pair of scales?
13 Who has directed the spirit of the
LORD? What counsellor stood at his side
to instruct him?
14 With whom did he confer to gain
discernment? Who taught him this path
of justice, or taught him knowledge, or
showed him the way of wisdom?
15 To him nations are but drops from a
bucket, no more than moisture on the
scales; to him coasts and islands weigh
as light as specks of dust!
16 Lebanon does not yield wood
enough for fuel, beasts enough for a
whole-offering.Isaiah 40.17–22
112
17 All the nations are as naught in his
sight; he reckons them as less than
nothing.
18 What likeness, then, will you find for
God or what form to resemble his?
19 An image which a craftsman makes,
and a goldsmith overlays with gold and
fits with studs of silver?
20 Or should someone choose mulberry-
wood, a wood that does not rot, and
seek out a skilful craftsman for the task
of setting up an image and making it
secure? (41-6) Each workman helps his
comrade, each encourages his fellow.
(41-7) The craftsman encourages the
goldsmith, the gilder him who strikes
the anvil; he declares the soldering to be
sound, and fastens the image with nails
so that it will remain secure.
21 Do you not know, have you not
heard, were you not told long ago, have
you not perceived ever since the world
was founded,
22 that God sits enthroned on the
vaulted roof of the world, and its
inhabitants appear as grasshoppers? He
stretches out the skies like a curtain,
spreads them out like a tent to live in;Isaiah 40.23–29
113
23 he reduces the great to naught and
makes earthly rulers as nothing.
24 Scarcely are they planted, scarcely
sown, scarcely have they taken root in
the ground, before he blows on them
and they wither, and a whirlwind carries
them off like chaff.
25 To whom, then, will you liken me,
whom set up as my equal? asks the Holy
One.
26 Lift up your eyes to the heavens;
consider who created these, led out their
host one by one, and summoned each
by name. Through his great might, his
strength and power, not one is missing.
27 Jacob, why do you complain, and
you, Israel, why do you say, My lot is
hidden from the LORD, my cause goes
unheeded by my God?
28 Do you not know, have you not
heard? The LORD, the eternal God,
creator of earth's farthest bounds,
does not weary or grow faint; his
understanding cannot be fathomed.
29 He gives vigour to the weary, new
strength to the exhausted.Isaiah 40.30–41.4
114
30 Young men may grow weary and
faint, even the fittest may stumble and
fall;
31 but those who look to the LORD will
win new strength, they will soar as on
eagles' wings; they will run and not feel
faint, march on and not grow weary.
1 Listen in silence to me, all you
coasts and islands; let the peoples
come to meet me. Let them draw near,
then let them speak up; together we
shall go to the place of judgement.
2 Who has raised up from the east
one greeted by victory wherever he
goes, making nations his subjects and
overthrowing their kings? He scatters
them with his sword like dust and with
his bow like chaff driven before the wind;
3 he puts them to flight and passes on
unscathed, swifter than any traveller on
foot.
4 Whose work is this, who has brought
it to pass? Who has summoned the
generations from the beginning? I, the
LORD, was with the first of them, and I
am with those who come after.
41Isaiah 41.5–12
115
5 Coasts and islands saw it and were
afraid, the world trembled from end to
end.
6 (40:20)
7 (40:20)
8 But you, Israel my servant, Jacob
whom I have chosen, descendants of my
friend Abraham,
9 I have taken you from the ends of
the earth, and summoned you from
its farthest corners; I have called you
my servant, have chosen you and not
rejected you:
10 have no fear, for I am with you; be
not afraid, for I am your God. I shall
strengthen you and give you help and
uphold you with my victorious right
hand.
11 Now all who defy you will be
confounded and put to shame; all who
set themselves against you will be as
nothing and will vanish.
12 You will look for your assailants but
you will not find them; those who take
up arms against you will be reduced to
nothing.Isaiah 41.13–19
116
13 For I, the LORD your God, take you
by the right hand and say to you, Have
no fear; it is I who help you.
14 Have no fear, Jacob you worm and
Israel you maggot. It is I who help you,
declares the LORD; your redeemer is the
Holy One of Israel.
15 See, I shall make of you a sharp
threshing-sledge, new and studded with
teeth; you will thresh mountains and
crush them to dust and reduce the hills
to chaff;
16 you will winnow them; the wind will
carry them away and a gale will scatter
them. Then you will rejoice in the LORD
and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
17 The poor and the needy look for
water and find none; their tongues are
parched with thirst. But I the LORD shall
provide for their wants; I, the God of
Israel, shall not forsake them.
18 I shall open rivers on the arid heights,
and wells in the valleys; I shall turn
the desert into pools and dry land into
springs of water;
19 I shall plant cedars in the wilderness,
acacias, myrtles, and wild olives; I shallIsaiah 41.20–25
117
grow pines on the barren heath side by
side with fir and box tree,
20 that everyone may see and know,
may once for all observe and understand
that the LORD himself has done this: it
is the creation of the Holy One of Israel.
21 Come, open your plea, says the
LORD, present your case, says Jacob's
King;
22 let these idols come forward and
foretell the future for us. Let them
declare the meaning of these past events
that we may reflect on it; let them
predict the future to us that we may
know what it holds.
23 Declare what is yet to happen;
then we shall know you are gods.
Do something, whether good or bad,
anything that will strike us with dismay
and fear.
24 You cannot! You are sprung from
nothing, your works are non-existent. To
choose you is outrageous!
25 I roused one from the north, and he
has come; I called from the east one
summoned in my name; he marches
over rulers as if they were mud, like a
potter treading clay.Isaiah 41.26–42.3
118
26 Who has declared this from the
beginning, that we might know it, or told
us beforehand so that we might say, He
was right? Not one of you declared, not
one foretold, no one heard a sound from
you.
27 I am the first to appoint a messenger
to Zion, a bringer of good news to
Jerusalem.
28 When I look round there is no one,
and among those gods no one to give
counsel; I ask a question and no one can
answer.
29 What empty things they all are!
Nothing they do amounts to anything,
their effigies are so much wind, mere
nothings.
1 Here is my servant, whom I
uphold, my chosen one, in whom
I take delight! I have put my spirit on
him; he will establish justice among the
nations.
2 He will not shout or raise his voice, or
make himself heard in the street.
3 He will not break a crushed reed or
snuff out a smouldering wick; unfailingly
he will establish justice.
42Isaiah 42.4–10
119
4 He will never falter or be crushed until
he sets justice on earth, while coasts
and islands await his teaching.
5 These are the words of the LORD who
is God, who created the heavens and
stretched them out, who fashioned the
earth and everything that grows in it,
giving breath to its people and life to
those who walk on it:
6 I the LORD have called you with
righteous purpose and taken you by the
hand; I have formed you, and destined
you to be a light for peoples, a lamp for
nations,
7 to open eyes that are blind, to
bring captives out of prison, out of the
dungeon where they lie in darkness.
8 I am the LORD; the LORD is my name;
I shall not yield my glory to another god,
nor my praise to any idol.
9 The earlier prophecies have come to
pass, and now I declare new things;
before they unfold, I announce them to
you.
10 Sing a new song to the LORD, sing
his praise throughout the world, you that
sail the broad seas, and you that inhabit
the coasts and islands.Isaiah 42.11–16
120
11 Let the wilderness and its settlements
rejoice, and the encampments where
Kedar lives. Let the inhabitants of Sela
shout for joy, let them cry out from the
hilltops.
12 Let the coasts and islands ascribe
glory to the LORD; let them sing his
praise.
13 The LORD will go forth as a warrior,
a soldier roused to the fury of battle; he
will shout, he will raise the battle cry and
triumph over his foes.
14 Long have I restrained myself, I kept
silence and held myself in check; now I
groan like a woman in labour, panting
and gasping.
15 I shall lay waste mountain and hill
and shrivel up all their herbage. I shall
change rivers into desert wastes and dry
up every pool.
16 I shall lead the blind on their way
and guide them along paths they do not
know; I shall turn darkness into light
before them and make straight their
twisting roads. These things I shall do
without fail.Isaiah 42.17–24
121
17 Those who put their trust in an
image, and say to idols, You are our
gods, will be repulsed in bitter shame.
18 You that are deaf, hear now; you that
are blind, look and see.
19 Who is blind but my servant, who so
deaf as the messenger I send? Who so
blind as the one who has my trust, so
deaf as the servant of the LORD?
20 You have seen much but perceived
little, your ears are open but you hear
nothing.
21 Though it pleased the LORD to further
his justice by making his law great and
glorious,
22 yet here is a people taken as spoil
and plundered, all of them shut up in
holes and hidden away in dungeons.
They are carried off as spoil without
hope of rescue, as plunder with no one
to demand their return.
23 Who among you will pay heed to this?
Who will give it close attention from now
on?
24 Who handed over Jacob for plunder,
who gave up Israel for spoil? Was it not
the LORD, against whom they sinned?Isaiah 42.25–43.4
122
They would not follow his ways and
refused obedience to his law;
25 so on Jacob he poured out his wrath,
anger and the fury of battle. It wrapped
him in flames, yet he did not learn, burnt
him, yet he did not lay it to heart.
1 But now, Jacob, this is the word
of the LORD, the word of your
Creator, of him who fashioned you,
Israel: Have no fear, for I have redeemed
you; I call you by name; you are mine.
2 When you pass through water I shall
be with you; when you pass through
rivers they will not overwhelm you;
walk through fire, and you will not be
scorched, through flames, and they will
not burn you.
3 I am the LORD your God, the Holy One
of Israel, your deliverer; I give Egypt
as ransom for you, Nubia and Seba in
exchange for you.
4 You are more precious to me than
the Assyrians; you are honoured, and I
love you. I would give the Edomites in
exchange for you, and any other people
for your life.
43Isaiah 43.5–10
123
5 Have no fear, for I am with you; I shall
bring your descendants from the east
and gather you from the west.
6 To the north I shall say, Give them up,
and to the south, Do not obstruct them.
Bring my sons and daughters from afar,
bring them back from the ends of the
earth:
7 everyone who bears my name, all
whom I have created, whom I have
formed, whom I have made for my glory.
8 Bring forward this people, a people
who have eyes but are blind, who have
ears but are deaf.
9 All the nations are gathered together
and the peoples assembled. Who among
them can expound what has gone before
or interpret this for us? Let them produce
their witnesses and prove their case;
let people hearing them say, That is the
truth.
10 The LORD declares, You are my
witnesses, you are my servants chosen
by me to know me and put your trust in
me and understand that I am the Lord.
Before me no god existed, nor will there
be any after me.Isaiah 43.11–18
124
11 I am the LORD, and I alone am your
deliverer.
12 I have made it known; I declared it,
I and no alien god among you, and you
are my witnesses, says the LORD. I am
God;
13 from everlasting I am he. None can
deliver from my hand; what I do, none
can undo.
14 These are the words of the LORD
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
For your sakes I shall send an army
to Babylon and lay the Chaldaeans
prostrate as they flee; their cry of
triumph will turn to lamentation.
15 Israel, I am the LORD, your Holy
One, your Creator and your King.
16 This is the word of the LORD, who
opened a way in the sea, a path through
mighty waters,
17 who drew on chariot and horse to
their destruction, an army in all its
strength; they lay down, never to rise
again; they were extinguished, snuffed
out like a wick:
18 Stop dwelling on past events and
brooding over days gone by.Isaiah 43.19–25
125
19 I am about to do something new;
this moment it will unfold. Can you not
perceive it? Even through the wilderness
I shall make a way, and paths in the
barren desert.
20 The wild beasts will do me honour,
the wolf and the desert-owl, for I shall
provide water in the wilderness and
rivers in the barren desert, where my
chosen people may drink,
21 this people I have formed for myself,
and they will proclaim my praises.
22 Yet, Jacob, you did not call upon me;
much less did you, Israel, weary yourself
in my service.
23 You did not bring me whole-offerings
from your flock or honour me with your
sacrifices; I did not exact grain-offerings
from you or weary you with demands for
frankincense.
24 You did not buy me aromatic cane
with your money or sate me with the fat
of your sacrifices. Rather you burdened
me with your sins and wearied me with
your crimes.
25 I am the LORD; for my own sake
I wipe out your transgressions and
remember your sins no more.Isaiah 43.26–44.6
126
26 Cite me to appear, let us argue it out;
set forth your pleading and establish
your innocence.
27 Your first forefather transgressed,
your spokesmen rebelled against me,
28 and your leaders desecrated my
sanctuary; that is why I put Jacob under
solemn curse and left Israel to be reviled.
1 Hear me now, Jacob my servant;
Israel, my chosen one, hear me.
2 Thus says the LORD your maker,
your helper, who fashioned you from
birth: Have no fear, Jacob my servant,
Jeshurun whom I have chosen,
3 for I shall pour down rain on thirsty
land, showers on dry ground. I shall
pour out my spirit on your offspring and
my blessing on your children.
4 They will grow up like a green
tamarisk, like willows by flowing
streams.
5 This person will say, I am the LORD's;
that one will call himself a son of Jacob;
another will write the LORD's name on
his hand and the name of Israel will be
added to his own.
6 Thus says the LORD, Israel's King, the
LORD of Hosts, his Redeemer: I am the
44Isaiah 44.7–12
127
first and I am the last, and there is no
god but me.
7 Who is like me? Let him speak up; let
him declare his proof and set it out for
me: let him announce beforehand things
to come, let him foretell what is yet to
be.
8 Take heart, have no fear. Did I not tell
you this long ago? I foretold it, and you
are my witnesses. Is there any god apart
from me, any other deity? I know none!
9 Those who make idols are all less
than nothing; their cherished images
profit nobody; their worshippers are
blind; their ignorance shows up their
foolishness.
10 Whoever makes a god or casts an
image, his labour is wasted.
11 All the votaries are put to shame; the
craftsmen are but mortals. Let them all
assemble and confront me; they will be
afraid and utterly shamed.
12 The blacksmith sharpens a graving
tool and hammers out his work hot from
the coals and shapes it with his strong
arm. Should he go hungry his strength
fails; if he has no water to drink he feels
exhausted.Isaiah 44.13–17
128
13 The woodworker draws his line taut
and marks out a figure with a scriber; he
planes the wood and measures it with
calipers, and he carves it to the shape of
a man, comely as the human form, to be
set up in a shrine.
14 A man plants a cedar and the rain
makes it grow, so that later on he will
have a tree to cut down; or he picks out
in the forest an ilex or an oak which he
will raise into a stout tree for himself.
15 It becomes fuel for his fire: some
of it he uses to warm himself, some he
kindles and bakes bread on it. Some he
even makes into a god, and prostrates
himself; he shapes it into an idol and
bows down before it.
16 One half of the wood he burns in the
fire and on this he roasts meat, so that
he may eat this and be satisfied; he also
warms himself and he says, Good! I can
feel the heat as I watch the flames.
17 Then what is left of the wood he
makes into a god, an image to which he
bows down and prostrates himself; he
prays to it and says, Save me; for you
are my god.Isaiah 44.18–23
129
18 Such people neither know nor
understand, their eyes made too blind to
see, their minds too narrow to discern.
19 Such a one will not use his reason; he
has neither the wit nor the sense to say,
Half of it I have burnt, and even used its
embers to bake bread; I have roasted
meat on them and eaten it; but the rest
of it I turn into this abominable object;
really I am worshipping a block of wood.
20 He feeds on ashes indeed! His
deluded mind has led him astray, and he
cannot recover his senses so far as to
say, This thing I am holding is a sham.
21 Jacob, remember all this; Israel,
remember, for you are my servant: I
have fashioned you, and you are in my
service; Israel, never forget me.
22 I have swept away your
transgressions like mist, and your
sins are dispersed like clouds; turn back
to me, for I have redeemed you.
23 Shout in triumph, you heavens, for it
is the LORD's doing; cry out for joy, you
lowest depths of the earth; break into
songs of triumph, you mountains, you
forest and all your trees; for the LORDIsaiah 44.24–45.1
130
has redeemed Jacob and through Israel
he wins glory.
24 Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,
who formed you from birth: I am the
LORD who made all things, by myself
I stretched out the heavens, alone I
fashioned the earth.
25 I frustrate false prophets and their
omens, and make fools of diviners; I
reverse what wise men say and make
nonsense of their wisdom.
26 I confirm my servants' prophecies
and bring about my messengers' plans.
Of Jerusalem I say, She will be inhabited
once more, and of the towns of Judah,
They will be rebuilt; I shall restore their
ruins.
27 I say to the deep waters, Be dried
up; I shall make your streams run dry.
28 I say to Cyrus, You will be my
shepherd to fulfil all my purpose, so
that Jerusalem may be rebuilt and the
foundations of the temple be laid.
1 Thus says the LORD to Cyrus his
anointed, whom he has taken by
the right hand, subduing nations before
him and stripping kings of their strength;
45Isaiah 45.2–8
131
before whom doors will be opened and
no gates barred:
2 I myself shall go before you and level
the swelling hills; I shall break down
bronze gates and cut through iron bars.
3 I shall give you treasures from dark
vaults, and hoards from secret places, so
that you may know that I am the LORD,
Israel's God, who calls you by name.
4 For the sake of Jacob my servant and
Israel my chosen one I have called you
by name and given you a title, though
you have not known me.
5 I am the LORD, and there is none
other; apart from me there is no god.
Though you have not known me I shall
strengthen you,
6 so that from east to west all may
know there is none besides me: I am the
LORD, and there is none other;
7 I make the light, I create the darkness;
author alike of wellbeing and woe, I, the
LORD, do all these things.
8 Rain righteousness, you heavens, let
the skies above pour it down, let the
earth open for it that salvation may
flourish with righteousness growing
beside it. I, the LORD, have created this.Isaiah 45.9–14
132
9 Will the pot contend with the potter,
or the earthenware with the hand that
shapes it? Will the clay ask the potter
what he is making or his handiwork say
to him, You have no skill?
10 Will the child say to his father, What
are you begetting? or to his mother,
What are you bringing to birth?
11 Thus says the LORD, Israel's Holy
One, his Maker: Would you dare question
me concerning my children, or instruct
me in my handiwork?
12 I alone made the earth and created
mankind upon it. With my own hands I
stretched out the heavens and directed
all their host.
13 With righteous purpose I have roused
this man, and I shall smooth all his
paths; he it is who will rebuild my city
and set my exiles free -- not for a price
nor for a bribe, says the LORD of Hosts.
14 These are the words of the LORD:
Toilers of Egypt and Nubian merchants
and Sabaeans bearing tribute will come
into your power and be your slaves, will
come and follow you in chains; they will
bow in submission before you, and say,Isaiah 45.15–20
133
Surely God is with you, and there is no
other god.
15 How then can you be a God who hides
himself, God of Israel, the Deliverer?
16 All the makers of idols are confounded
and brought to shame, they perish in
confusion together.
17 But Israel has been delivered by the
LORD, a deliverance for all time to come;
they will never be confounded, never put
to shame.
18 Thus says the LORD, the Creator of
the heavens, he who is God, who made
the earth and fashioned it and by himself
fixed it firmly, who created it not as a
formless waste but as a place to be lived
in: I am the LORD, and there is none
other.
19 I did not speak in secret, in realms
of darkness; I did not say to Jacob's
people, Look for me in the formless
waste. I the LORD speak what is right, I
declare what is just.
20 Gather together, come, draw near,
you survivors of the nations, who
in ignorance carry wooden idols in
procession, praying to a god that cannot
save.Isaiah 45.21–46.2
134
21 Come forward and urge your case,
consult together: who foretold this in
days of old, who stated it long ago? Was
it not I, the LORD? There is no god but
me, none other than I, victorious and
able to save.
22 From every corner of the earth turn
to me and be saved; for I am God, there
is none other.
23 By my life I have sworn, I have given
a promise of victory, a promise that will
not be broken; to me every knee will
bow, by me every tongue will swear,
24 saying, In the LORD alone are victory
and might. All who defy him will stand
ashamed in his presence,
25 but all Israel's descendants will be
victorious and will glory in the LORD.
1 Bel has crouched down, Nebo
stooped low: their images, once
carried in your processions, have been
loaded on to beasts and cattle, a burden
for the weary creatures;
2 though they stoop and crouch, they
are not able to bring the burden to
safety, but they themselves go into
captivity.
46Isaiah 46.3–9
135
3 Listen to me, house of Jacob and all
who remain of the house of Israel, a load
on me from your birth, upheld by me
from the womb:
4 Till you grow old I am the LORD, and
when white hairs come, I shall carry you
still; I have made you and I shall uphold
you, I shall carry you away to safety.
5 To whom will you liken me? Who is my
equal? With whom can you compare me?
Where is my like?
6 Those who squander their bags of gold
and weigh out their silver with a balance
hire a goldsmith to fashion it into a god;
then they prostrate themselves before it
in worship;
7 they hoist it shoulder-high and carry
it and set it down on its place; there it
must stand, it cannot stir from the spot.
Let a man cry to it as he will, it does not
answer; it cannot deliver him from his
troubles.
8 Remember this and abandon hope;
consider it well, you rebels.
9 Remember all that happened long ago,
for I am God, and there is none other; I
am God, and there is no one like me.Isaiah 46.10–47.3
136
10 From the beginning I reveal the
end, from ancient times what is yet to
be; I say, My purpose stands, I shall
accomplish all that I please.
11 I summon a bird of prey from the
east -- from a distant land a man to fulfil
my design. I have spoken and I shall
bring it to pass, I have planned it, and I
shall carry it out.
12 Listen to me, you stubborn of heart,
for whom victory is far off:
13 I bring my victory near, mine is not
far off, and my deliverance will not be
delayed; In Zion I shall grant deliverance
for Israel my glory.
1 Come down and sit in the
dust, virgin daughter of Babylon.
Descend from your throne and sit on the
ground, daughter of the Chaldaeans;
never again will you be called tender and
delicate.
2 Take the handmill, grind meal, remove
your veil; strip off your skirt, bare your
thighs, wade through rivers,
3 so that your nakedness may be
seen, your shame exposed. I shall take
vengeance and show clemency to none,
47Isaiah 47.4–10
137
4 says our Redeemer, the Holy One of
Israel, whose name is the LORD of Hosts.
5 Daughter of the Chaldaeans, go into
the darkness and sit in silence; for never
again will you be called queen of many
kingdoms.
6 I was angry with my people; I
dishonoured my own possession and
surrendered them into your power. You
showed them no mercy; even on the
aged you laid a very heavy yoke.
7 You said, I shall reign a queen for
ever; you gave no thought to your
actions, nor did you consider their
outcome.
8 Now listen to this, you lover of luxury,
carefree on your throne, saying to
yourself, I am, and there is none other.
I shall never sit in widow's mourning,
never know the loss of children.
9 Yet suddenly, in a single day, both
these things will come upon you; they
will both come upon you in full measure:
loss of children and widowhood, despite
your many sorceries, all your countless
spells.
10 Secure in your wicked ways you
thought, No one can see me. It wasIsaiah 47.11–48.1
138
your wisdom and knowledge that led you
astray. You said to yourself, I am, and
there is none other.
11 Therefore evil will overtake you, and
you will not know how to conjure it away;
disaster will befall you, and you will not
be able to avert it; ruin all unforeseen
will suddenly come upon you.
12 Persist in your spells and your many
sorceries, in which you have trafficked all
your life. Maybe you can get help from
them! Maybe you will yet inspire terror!
13 In spite of your many wiles you are
powerless. Let your astrologers, your
star-gazers who foretell your future
month by month, persist, and save you!
14 But they are like stubble and fire
burns them up; they cannot snatch
themselves from the flame. It is not a
glowing coal to warm them, not a fire for
them to sit by!
15 So much for your magicians with
whom you have trafficked all your life:
they have wandered off, each his own
way, and there is not one to save you.
1 Hear this, you house of Jacob,
who are called by the name of
Israel, and have sprung from the seed of
48Isaiah 48.2–7
139
Judah; who swear by the name of the
LORD and invoke the God of Israel, but
not with honesty and sincerity,
2 though you call yourselves citizens of
the Holy City and lean for support on the
God of Israel, whose name is the LORD
of Hosts:
3 Long ago I announced what would
first happen, I revealed it with my own
mouth; suddenly I acted and it came
about.
4 Knowing your stubbornness, your
neck being as stiff as iron, your brow like
brass,
5 I told you of these things long ago,
and declared them to you before they
happened, so that you could not say,
They were my idol's doing; my image,
the god that I fashioned, ordained them.
6 You have heard what I said; consider
it well, and admit the truth of it. From
now on I show you new things, hidden
things you did not know before.
7 They were not created long ago, but
in this very hour; before today you had
never heard of them. You cannot claim, I
know them already.Isaiah 48.8–14
140
8 You neither heard nor knew; your ears
were closed long ago. I knew that you
were treacherous and rebellious from
your birth.
9 For the sake of my own name I was
patient; rather than destroy you I held
myself in check.
10 I tested you, but not as silver is
tested: it was in the furnace of affliction
I purified you.
11 For my honour's sake, for my own
honour I did it; I will not let my name be
profaned or yield my glory to any other
god.
12 Listen to me, Jacob, and Israel whom
I have called: I am the LORD; I am the
first, I am the last also.
13 My hand founded the earth, my
right hand spread the expanse of the
heavens; when I summoned them, they
came at once into being.
14 Assemble, all of you, and listen;
which of you has declared what is
coming, that he whom I love will carry
out my purpose against Babylon and the
Chaldaeans will be scattered?Isaiah 48.15–21
141
15 I myself have spoken, I have
summoned him, I have brought him
here, and his mission will prosper.
16 Draw near to me and hear this: from
the beginning I have never spoken in
secret, and at its time of fulfilment I was
there.
17 Thus says the LORD your Redeemer,
the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD
your God: I teach you for your own
wellbeing and lead you in the way you
should go.
18 If only you had listened to my
commands, your prosperity would have
rolled on like a river, your success like
the waves of the sea;
19 your children would have been like
the sand in number, your descendants
countless as its grains; their name would
never be erased or blotted from my
sight.
20 Go out from Babylon, hasten away
from the Chaldaeans; proclaim it with
joyful song, sending out the news to the
ends of the earth; tell them, The LORD
has redeemed his servant Jacob.
21 Though he led them through desert
places, they suffered no thirst; he madeIsaiah 48.22–49.6
142
water flow for them from the rock, for
them he split the rock and streams
gushed forth.
22 There is no peace for the wicked,
says the LORD.
1 LISTEN to me, you coasts and
islands, pay heed, you peoples far
distant: the LORD called me before I was
born, he named me from my mother's
womb.
2 He made my tongue a sharp sword
and hid me under the shelter of his
hand; he made me into a polished arrow,
in his quiver he concealed me.
3 He said to me, Israel, you are my
servant through whom I shall win glory.
4 Once I said, I have toiled in vain; I
have spent my strength for nothing, and
to no purpose. Yet my cause is with the
LORD and my reward with my God.
5 The LORD had formed me in the womb
to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to
him that Israel should be gathered to
him, so that I might rise to honour in the
LORD's sight and my God might be my
strength.
6 And now the LORD has said to me:
It is too slight a task for you, as my
49Isaiah 49.7–10
143
servant, to restore the tribes of Jacob, to
bring back the survivors of Israel: I shall
appoint you a light to the nations so that
my salvation may reach earth's farthest
bounds.
7 These are the words of the Holy One,
the LORD who redeems Israel, to one
who is despised, and whom people
abhor, the slave of tyrants: Kings will
rise when they see you, princes will do
homage, because of the LORD who is
faithful, because of Israel's Holy One
who has chosen you.
8 These are the words of the LORD: In
the time of my favour I answered you;
on the day of deliverance I came to your
aid. I have formed you, and destined you
to be a light for peoples, restoring the
land and allotting once more its desolate
holdings.
9 I said to the prisoners, Go free, and
to those in darkness, Come out into the
open. Along every path they will find
pasture and grazing in all the arid places.
10 They will neither hunger nor thirst,
nor will scorching heat or sun distress
them; for one who loves them will guide
them and lead them by springs of water.Isaiah 49.11–18
144
11 I shall make every hill a path and
raise up my highways.
12 They are coming: some from far
away, some from the north and the west,
and others from the land of Syene.
13 Shout for joy, you heavens; earth,
rejoice; break into songs of triumph, you
mountains, for the LORD has comforted
his people and has had pity on them in
their distress.
14 But Zion says, The LORD has forsaken
me; my Lord has forgotten me.
15 Can a woman forget the infant at
her breast, or a mother the child of her
womb? But should even these forget, I
shall never forget you.
16 I have inscribed you on the palms of
my hands; your walls are always before
my eyes.
17 Those who rebuild you make better
speed than those who pulled you down,
while those who laid you waste leave you
and go.
18 Raise your eyes and look around:
they are all assembling, flocking back to
you. By my life I, the LORD, swear it:
you will wear them as your jewels, and
adorn yourself with them like a bride;Isaiah 49.19–23
145
19 I did indeed make you waste and
desolate, I razed you to the ground,
but now the land is too small for its
inhabitants, while they who made you a
ruin are far away.
20 Children born during your
bereavement will say, Make room
for us to live here, the place is too
cramped.
21 Then you will say to yourself, Who
bore these children for me, bereaved
and barren as I was? Who reared them
when I was left alone, left by myself;
where did I get them?
22 These are the words of the Lord
GOD: I shall beckon to the nations and
hoist my signal to the peoples, and they
will bring your sons in their arms and
your daughters will be carried on their
shoulders;
23 kings will be your foster-fathers, their
princesses serve as your nurses. They
will bow to the earth before you and lick
the dust from your feet. You will know
that I am the LORD; none who look to
me will be disappointed.Isaiah 49.24–50.2
146
24 Can spoil be snatched from the
strong man, or a captive liberated from
the ruthless?
25 Yes, says the LORD, the captive will
be taken even from the strong, and the
spoil of the ruthless will be liberated;
I shall contend with all who contend
against you and deliver your children
from them.
26 I shall make your oppressors eat
their own flesh, and they will be drunk
with their own blood as if with wine, and
all mankind will know that I the LORD
am your Deliverer, your Redeemer, the
Mighty One of Jacob.
1 These are the words of the
Lord: Is there anywhere a deed
of divorce by which I put your mother
away? Which creditor of mine was there
to whom I sold you? No; for your own
wickedness you were sold and for your
misconduct your mother was put away.
2 Why did I find no one when I came?
Why, when I called, did no one answer?
Can my arm not reach out to deliver? Do
you think I lacked the power to save?
Did I not by my rebuke dry up the sea
and turn rivers into desert, the fish in
50Isaiah 50.3–9
147
them stinking for lack of water and dying
of thirst?
3 Did I not clothe the heavens with
mourning, and cover them with
sackcloth?
4 The Lord GOD has given me the
tongue of one who has been instructed
to console the weary with a timely
word; he made my hearing sharp every
morning, that I might listen like one
under instruction.
5 The Lord GOD opened my ears and I
did not disobey or turn back in defiance.
6 I offered my back to the lash, and let
my beard be plucked from my chin, I did
not hide my face from insult and spitting.
7 But the Lord GOD is my helper;
therefore no insult can wound me; I
know that I shall not be put to shame,
therefore I have set my face like flint.
8 One who will clear my name is at my
side. Who dare argue against me? Let us
confront one another. Who will dispute
my cause? Let him come forward.
9 The Lord GOD is my helper; who then
can declare me guilty? They will all wear
out like a garment; the moth will devour
them.Isaiah 50.10–51.4
148
10 Whoever among you fears the LORD,
let him obey his servant's commands.
The one who walks in dark places with
no light, let him trust in the name of the
LORD and rely on his God.
11 But all who kindle a fire and set
firebrands alight, walk by the light of
your fire and the firebrands you have set
ablaze. This is your fate at my hands:
you shall lie down in torment.
1 Listen to me, all who follow after
the right, who seek the LORD:
consider the rock from which you were
hewn, the quarry from which you were
cut;
2 consider Abraham your father and
Sarah who gave you birth: when I called
him he was but one; I blessed him and
made him many.
3 The LORD has comforted Zion,
comforted all her ruined homes, turning
her wilderness into an Eden, her arid
plains into a garden of the LORD.
Gladness and joy will be found in her,
thanksgiving and melody.
4 Pay heed to me, my people, and listen
to me, my nation, for instruction will
51Isaiah 51.5–9
149
shine forth from me and my judgement
will be a light to peoples.
5 In an instant I bring near my victory;
my deliverance will appear and my arm
will rule the peoples; coasts and islands
will wait for me and look to me for
protection.
6 Raise your eyes heavenwards; look
on the earth beneath: though the
heavens be dispersed as smoke and the
earth wear out like a garment and its
inhabitants die like flies, my deliverance
will be everlasting and my saving power
will remain unbroken.
7 Listen to me, my people who know
what is right, you that lay my instruction
to heart: do not fear the taunts of
enemies, do not let their reviling dismay
you;
8 for they will be like a garment
devoured by grubs, like wool consumed
by moths, but my saving power will
last for ever and my deliverance to all
generations.
9 Awake, awake! Arm of the LORD, put
on strength; awake as you did in days
of old, in ages long past. Was it not youIsaiah 51.10–15
150
who hacked Rahab in pieces and ran the
dragon through?
10 Was it not you who dried up the
sea, the waters of the great abyss, and
made the ocean depths a path for the
redeemed?
11 The LORD's people, set free, will
come back and enter Zion with shouts of
triumph, crowned with everlasting joy.
Gladness and joy will come upon them,
while suffering and weariness flee away.
12 I am he who comforts you; why then
fear man who must die, who must perish
like grass?
13 Why have you forgotten the LORD
your maker, who stretched out the
heavens and founded the earth? Why
are you in constant fear all the day long?
Why dread the fury of the oppressors
bent on your destruction? Where is the
oppressors' fury?
14 He who cowers under it will soon be
set free; he will not be consigned to a
dungeon and die there lacking food.
15 I am the LORD your God, who stirred
up the sea so that its waves roared. The
LORD of Hosts is my name.Isaiah 51.16–22
151
16 I have put my words in your mouth
and kept you covered under the shelter
of my hand. I who fixed the heavens in
place and established the earth say to
Zion, You are my people.
17 Arouse yourself; rise up, Jerusalem.
From the LORD's hand you have drunk
the cup of his wrath, drained to its dregs
the bowl of drunkenness;
18 of all the sons you have borne there
is not one to guide you, of all you have
reared not one to take you by the hand.
19 This twofold disaster has overtaken
you: havoc and ruin -- who can condole
with you? Famine and sword -- who can
comfort you?
20 Your children lie in a stupor at every
street corner, like antelopes caught in a
net. They are glutted with the wrath of
the LORD, with the rebuke of your God.
21 Therefore listen to this in your
affliction, you that are drunk, but not
with wine.
22 Thus says the LORD, your Lord
and God, who will plead his people's
cause: I take from your hand the cup of
drunkenness. Never again will you drink
from the bowl of my wrath;Isaiah 51.23–52.6
152
23 I shall hand it to your tormentors,
those who said to you, Lie down for us to
walk over you. You flattened your back
like ground beneath their feet, like a
road for them to walk over.
1 Awake, awake, Zion, put on your
strength; Jerusalem, Holy City,
put on your splendid garments! For the
uncircumcised and the unclean will never
again come into you.
2 Arise, captive Jerusalem, shake off the
dust; undo the ropes about your neck,
you captive daughter of Zion.
3 The LORD says, You were sold but no
price was paid, and without payment you
will be redeemed.
4 The Lord GOD says: At its beginning
my people went down into Egypt to
live there, and in the end it was the
Assyrians who oppressed them.
5 But now what do I find here? says the
LORD. My people carried off and no price
paid, their rulers wailing, and my name
reviled increasingly all day long, says the
LORD.
6 But on that day my people will know
my name and know that it is I the LORD
who speak; here I am.
52Isaiah 52.7–13
153
7 How beautiful on the mountains are
the feet of the herald, the bringer of
good news, announcing deliverance,
proclaiming to Zion, Your God has
become king.
8 Your watchmen raise their voices and
shout together in joy; for with their own
eyes they see the LORD return to Zion.
9 Break forth together into shouts of joy,
you ruins of Jerusalem; for the LORD has
comforted his people, he has redeemed
Jerusalem.
10 The LORD has bared his holy arm in
the sight of all nations, and the whole
world from end to end shall see the
deliverance wrought by our God.
11 Go out, leave Babylon behind, touch
nothing unclean. Leave Babylon behind,
keep yourselves pure, you that carry the
vessels of the LORD.
12 But you will not come out in urgent
haste or leave like fugitives; for the
LORD will go before you, your rearguard
will be Israel's God.
13 My servant will achieve success,
he will be raised to honour, high and
exalted.Isaiah 52.14–53.4
154
14 Time was when many were appalled
at you, my people; so now many nations
recoil at the sight of him, and kings curl
their lips in disgust. His form, disfigured,
lost all human likeness; his appearance
so changed he no longer looked like a
man. They see what they had never
been told and their minds are full of
things unheard before.
15 (52:14)
1 Who could have believed what
we have heard? To whom has the
power of the LORD been revealed?
2 He grew up before the LORD like a
young plant whose roots are in parched
ground; he had no beauty, no majesty to
catch our eyes, no grace to attract us to
him.
3 He was despised, shunned by all,
pain-racked and afflicted by disease;
we despised him, we held him of no
account, an object from which people
turn away their eyes.
4 Yet it was our afflictions he was
bearing, our pain he endured, while we
thought of him as smitten by God, struck
down by disease and misery.
53Isaiah 53.5–10
5 But
155
he was pierced for our
transgressions, crushed for our
iniquities; the chastisement he bore
restored us to health and by his wounds
we are healed.
6 We had all strayed like sheep, each of
us going his own way, but the LORD laid
on him the guilt of us all.
7 He was maltreated, yet he was
submissive and did not open his mouth;
like a sheep led to the slaughter, like a
ewe that is dumb before the shearers,
he did not open his mouth.
8 He was arrested and sentenced and
taken away, and who gave a thought to
his fate -- how he was cut off from the
world of the living, stricken to death for
my people's transgression?
9 He was assigned a grave with the
wicked, a burial-place among felons,
though he had done no violence, had
spoken no word of treachery.
10 Yet the LORD took thought for his
oppressed servant and healed him who
had given himself as a sacrifice for
sin. He will enjoy long life and see his
children's children, and in his hand the
LORD's purpose will prosper.Isaiah 53.11–54.4
156
11 By his humiliation my servant will
justify many; after his suffering he will
see light and be satisfied; it is their guilt
he bears.
12 Therefore I shall allot him a portion
with the great, and he will share the
spoil with the mighty, because he
exposed himself to death and was
reckoned among transgressors, for he
bore the sin of many and interceded for
transgressors.
1 Sing, barren woman who never
bore a child; break into a shout of
joy, you that have never been in labour;
for the deserted wife will have more
children than she who lives with her
husband, says the LORD.
2 Enlarge the space for your dwelling,
extend the curtains of your tent to
the full; let out its ropes and drive the
tent-pegs home;
3 for you will spread from your confines
right and left, your descendants will
dispossess nations and will people cities
now desolate.
4 Fear not, you will not be put to shame;
do not be downcast, you will not suffer
disgrace. It is time to forget the shame
54Isaiah 54.5–10
157
of your younger days and remember no
more the reproach of your widowhood;
5 for your husband is your Maker; his
name is the LORD of Hosts. He who is
called God of all the earth, the Holy One
of Israel, is your redeemer.
6 The LORD has acknowledged you a
wife again, once deserted and heart-
broken; your God regards you as a wife
still young, though you were once cast
off.
7 For a passing moment I forsook you,
but with tender affection I shall bring
you home again.
8 In an upsurge of anger I hid my face
from you for a moment; but now have I
pitied you with never-failing love, says
the LORD, your Redeemer.
9 For this to me is like the days of Noah;
as I swore that the waters of Noah's
flood should never again pour over the
earth, so now I swear to you never again
to be angry with you or rebuke you.
10 Though the mountains may move
and the hills shake, my love will be
immovable and never fail, and my
covenant promising peace will not beIsaiah 54.11–17
158
shaken, says the LORD in his pity for
you.
11 Storm-battered city, distressed
and desolate, now I shall set your
stones in the finest mortar and lay your
foundations with sapphires;
12 I shall make your battlements of red
jasper and your gates of garnet; all your
boundary stones will be precious jewels.
13 Your children will all be instructed
by the LORD, and they will enjoy great
prosperity.
14 You will be restored triumphantly.
You will be free from oppression and
have nothing to fear; you will be free
from terror, for it will not come near you.
15 Should anyone attack you, it will
not be my doing; for his attempt the
aggressor will perish.
16 It was I who created the smith to fan
the coals in the fire and forge weapons
for every purpose; and I created the
destroyer to deal out havoc.
17 But the weapon that will prevail
against you has not been made, and
the accuser who rises in court against
you will be refuted. These benefits are
enjoyed by the servants of the LORD;Isaiah 55.1–7
159
their victory comes from me. This is the
word of the LORD.
1 Come for water, all who are
thirsty; though you have no
money, come, buy grain and eat; come,
buy wine and milk, not for money, not
for a price.
2 Why spend your money for what is
not food, your earnings on what fails to
satisfy? Listen to me and you will fare
well, you will enjoy the fat of the land.
3 Come to me and listen to my words,
hear me and you will have life: I shall
make an everlasting covenant with you
to love you faithfully as I loved David.
4 I appointed him a witness to peoples,
a prince ruling over them;
5 and you in turn will summon nations
you do not know, and nations that do not
know you will hasten to you, because
the LORD your God, Israel's Holy One,
has made you glorious.
6 Seek the LORD while he is present,
call to him while he is close at hand.
7 Let the wicked abandon their ways
and the evil their thoughts: let them
return to the LORD, who will take pity on
55Isaiah 55.8–13
160
them, and to our God, for he will freely
forgive.
8 For my thoughts are not your
thoughts, nor are your ways my ways.
This is the word of the LORD.
9 But as the heavens are high above
the earth, so are my ways high above
your ways and my thoughts above your
thoughts.
10 As the rain and snow come down
from the heavens and do not return
there without watering the earth, making
it produce grain to give seed for sowing
and bread to eat,
11 so is it with my word issuing from my
mouth; it will not return to me empty
without accomplishing my purpose and
succeeding in the task for which I sent it.
12 You will go out with joy and be led
forth in peace. Before you mountains
and hills will break into cries of joy, and
all the trees in the countryside will clap
their hands.
13 Pine trees will grow in place of
camel-thorn, myrtles instead of briars;
all this will be a memorial for the LORD,
a sign that for all time will not be cut off.Isaiah 56.1–6
161
1 THESE are the words of the
56 LORD: Maintain justice, and do
what is right; for my deliverance is close
at hand, and my victory will soon be
revealed.
2 Happy is the person who follows these
precepts and holds fast to them, who
keeps the sabbath unprofaned, who
keeps his hand from all wrongdoing!
3 The foreigner who has given his
allegiance to the LORD must not say, The
LORD will exclude me from his people.
The eunuch must not say, I am naught
but a barren tree.
4 These are the words of the LORD: The
eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, who
choose to do my will and hold fast to my
covenant,
5 will receive from me something better
than sons and daughters, a memorial
and a name in my own house and within
my walls; I shall give them everlasting
renown, an imperishable name.
6 So too with the foreigners who give
their allegiance to me, to minister to
me and love my name and become
my servants, all who keep the sabbathIsaiah 56.7–12
162
unprofaned and hold fast to my
covenant:
7 these I shall bring to my holy hill and
give them joy in my house of prayer.
Their offerings and sacrifices will be
acceptable on my altar; for my house
will be called a house of prayer for all
nations.
8 This is the word of the Lord GOD, who
gathers those driven out of Israel: I shall
add to those who have already been
gathered.
9 All you beasts of the open country and
of the forest, come and eat your fill.
10 For all Israel's watchmen are blind,
perceiving nothing; they are all dumb
dogs that cannot bark, dreaming, as
they lie stretched on the ground, loving
their sleep,
11 greedy dogs that can never have
enough. They are shepherds who
understand nothing, all of them going
their own way, one and all intent on their
own gain.
12 Come, says each of them, let me
fetch wine, strong drink, and we shall
swill it down; tomorrow will be like today,
or better still!Isaiah 57.1–7
163
1 The righteous perish, and no one
57 is concerned; all who are loyal to
their faith are swept away and no one
gives it a thought. The righteous are
swept away by the onset of evil;
2 those who have followed a straight
course shall achieve peace at the last, as
they lie on their deathbeds.
3 Come near, you children of a
soothsayer. You spawn of an adulterer
and a harlot,
4 who is the target of your jests? Against
whom do you open your mouths and
stick out your tongues? Children of sin,
spawn of a lie,
5 you are burning with lust under the
sacred oaks, under every spreading tree,
and sacrificing children in the wadis,
under the rocky clefts.
6 And you, woman, your place is with
the deceitful gods of the wadi; that is
where you belong. To them you have
poured a libation and presented an
offering of grain. In spite of this am I to
relent?
7 On a high mountaintop you have made
your bed; there too you have gone up to
offer sacrifice.Isaiah 57.8–13
164
8 Beside door and doorpost you have
put up your sign. Deserting me, you
have stripped and lain down on the wide
bed which you have made; you drove
bargains with men for the pleasure of
sleeping together and making love.
9 You drenched your tresses with oil,
were lavish in your use of perfumes; you
sent out your procurers far and wide
even down to the confines of Sheol.
10 Though worn out by your unending
excesses, you never thought your plight
desperate. You found renewed vigour
and so had no anxiety.
11 Whom do you fear so much, that
you should be false, that you never
remembered me or spared me a
thought? Did I not keep silent and look
away while you showed no fear of me?
12 Now I shall expose your conduct that
you think so righteous. Your idols will
not help you when you cry; they will not
save you. The wind will carry them off,
one and all, a puff of air will take them
away; but he who makes me his refuge
will possess the land and inherit my holy
hill.
13 (57:12)Isaiah 57.14–20
165
14 Then the LORD will say: Build up a
highway, clear the road, remove all that
blocks my people's path.
15 These are the words of the high and
exalted One, who is enthroned for ever,
whose name is holy: I dwell in a high and
holy place and with him who is broken
and humble in spirit, to revive the spirit
of the humble, to revive the courage of
the broken.
16 I shall not be always accusing, I shall
not continually nurse my wrath, else
the spirit of the creatures whom I made
would be faint because of me.
17 For a brief time I was angry at the
guilt of Israel. I smote him in my anger
and withdrew my favour, but he was
wayward and went his own way.
18 I have seen his conduct, yet I shall
heal him and give him relief; I shall bring
him comfort in full measure, and on the
lips of those who mourn him
19 I shall create words of praise. Peace,
peace, for all, both far and near; I shall
heal them, says the LORD.
20 But the wicked are like a storm-
tossed sea, a sea that cannot be still,
whose waters cast up mud and dirt.Isaiah 57.21–58.5
166
21 There is no peace for the wicked,
says my God.
1 Shout aloud without restraint;
lift up your voice like a trumpet.
Declare to my people their transgression,
to the house of Jacob their sins,
2 although they ask guidance of me
day after day and say they delight in
knowing my ways. As if they were a
nation which had acted rightly and had
not abandoned the just laws of their
God, they ask me for righteous laws and
delight in approaching God.
3 Why should we fast, if you ignore
it? Why mortify ourselves, if you pay
no heed? In fact you serve your own
interests on your fast-day and keep all
your men hard at work.
4 Your fasting leads only to wrangling
and strife and to lashing out with vicious
blows. On such a day the fast you are
keeping is not one that will carry your
voice to heaven.
5 Is this the kind of fast that I require,
a day of mortification such as this: that
a person should bow his head like a
bulrush and use sackcloth and ashes for
58Isaiah 58.6–10
167
a bed? Is that what you call a fast, a day
acceptable to the LORD?
6 Rather, is not this the fast I require:
to loose the fetters of injustice, to untie
the knots of the yoke, and set free those
who are oppressed, tearing off every
yoke?
7 Is it not sharing your food with the
hungry, taking the homeless poor into
your house, clothing the naked when you
meet them, and never evading a duty to
your kinsfolk?
8 Then your light will break forth like the
dawn, and new skin will speedily grow
over your wound; your righteousness
will be your vanguard and the glory of
the LORD your rearguard.
9 Then, when you call, the LORD will
answer; when you cry to him, he will
say, Here I am. If you cease to pervert
justice, to point the accusing finger and
lay false charges,
10 if you give of your own food to the
hungry and satisfy the needs of the
wretched, then light will rise for you out
of darkness and dusk will be for you like
noonday;Isaiah 58.11–59.2
168
11 the LORD will be your guide
continually and will satisfy your needs in
the bare desert; he will give you strength
of limb; you will be like a well-watered
garden, like a spring whose waters never
fail.
12 Buildings long in ruins will be restored
by your own kindred and you will build
on ancient foundations; you will be
called the rebuilder of broken walls, the
restorer of houses in ruins.
13 If you refrain from sabbath journeys
and from doing business on my holy day,
if you call the sabbath a day of joy and
the LORD's holy day worthy of honour,
if you honour it by desisting from work
and not pursuing your own interests or
attending to your own affairs,
14 then you will find your joy in the
LORD, and I shall make you ride on the
heights of the earth, and the holding of
your father Jacob will be yours to enjoy.
The LORD himself has spoken.
1 The LORD's arm is not too short
to save nor his ear too dull to
hear;
2 rather, it is your iniquities that raise a
barrier between you and your God; it is
59Isaiah 59.3–9
169
your sins that veil his face, so that he
does not hear.
3 Your hands are stained with blood and
your fingers with crime; your lips speak
lies and your tongues utter injustice.
4 No one sues with just cause, no
one makes an honest plea in court;
all rely on empty words, they tell lies,
they conceive mischief and bring forth
wickedness.
5 They hatch snakes' eggs; they weave
cobwebs. Whoever eats those eggs will
die, for rottenness hatches from rotten
eggs.
6 Their webs are useless for making
cloth; no one can use them for clothing.
Their works breed wickedness and their
hands are full of acts of violence.
7 They rush headlong into crime in
furious haste to shed innocent blood;
their schemes are harmful and leave a
trail of havoc and ruin.
8 They are strangers to the path of
peace, no justice guides their steps; all
the ways they choose are crooked; no
one who walks in them feels safe.
9 That is why justice is far removed
from us, and righteousness is out ofIsaiah 59.10–15
170
our reach. We look for light, but all is
darkness; for daybreak, but we must
walk in deep gloom.
10 We grope like blind men along a wall,
feeling our way like those whose sight
has gone; we stumble at noonday as
if it were nightfall, like the dead in the
desolate underworld.
11 All of us growl like bears, we keep
moaning like doves; we wait for justice,
but there is none, for deliverance, but it
is far from us.
12 Our transgressions against you are
many, and our sins bear witness against
us; our transgressions are on our minds,
and well we know our guilt:
13 we have rebelled and broken faith
with the LORD, we have relapsed and
forsaken our God; we have conceived
lies in our hearts and repeated them in
slanderous and treacherous words.
14 Justice is rebuffed and flouted while
righteousness stands at a distance; truth
stumbles in court and honesty is kept
outside,
15 so truth is lost to sight, and those
who shun evil withdraw. There was noIsaiah 59.16–21
171
justice, and when the LORD saw it he
was displeased.
16 He saw that there was no help
forthcoming and was outraged that
no one intervened; so his own might
brought him the victory and his
righteousness supported him.
17 He put on righteousness as a
breastplate and salvation as a helmet
on his head; he put on the garments of
vengeance and wrapped zeal about him
like a cloak.
18 According to their deeds he will
repay: for his adversaries, anger; for his
enemies, retribution!
19 So from the west the LORD's name
will be feared, and his glory revered
from the rising of the sun. His glory will
come like a swift river on which the wind
of the LORD moves.
20 He will come as a redeemer to Zion
and to those in Jacob who repent of their
rebellion. This is the word of the LORD.
21 This, says the LORD, is my covenant,
which I make with them: My spirit which
rests on you and my words which I have
put into your mouth will never fail you
from generation to generation of yourIsaiah 60.1–7
172
descendants from now on, for evermore.
The LORD has said it.
1 ARISE, shine, Jerusalem, for
your light has come; and over you
the glory of the LORD has dawned.
2 Though darkness covers the earth
and dark night the nations, on you the
LORD shines and over you his glory will
appear;
3 nations will journey towards your light
and kings to your radiance.
4 Raise your eyes and look around: they
are all assembling, flocking back to you;
your sons are coming from afar, your
daughters walking beside them.
5 You will see it, and be radiant with joy,
and your heart will thrill with gladness;
sea-borne riches will be lavished on you
and the wealth of nations will be yours.
6 Camels in droves will cover the land,
young camels from Midian and Ephah,
all coming from Sheba laden with gold
and frankincense, heralds of the LORD's
praise.
7 Kedar's flocks will all be gathered for
you, rams of Nebaioth will serve your
needs, acceptable offerings on my altar;
60Isaiah 60.8–13
173
I shall enhance the splendour of my
temple.
8 Who are these that sail along like
clouds, that fly like doves to their
dovecots?
9 They are vessels assembling from the
coasts and islands, ships of Tarshish
leading the convoy; they bring your
children from far away, their silver and
gold with them, to the honour of the
LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel;
for he has made you glorious.
10 Foreigners will rebuild your walls and
their kings will be your servants; though
in my wrath I struck you down, now in
my favour I show you pity.
11 Your gates will stand open at all
times; day and night they will never
be shut, so that through them may be
brought the wealth of nations and their
kings under escort.
12 For the nation or kingdom which
refuses to serve you will perish; and
there will be widespread devastation
among such nations.
13 The glory of Lebanon will come to
you, pine, fir, and boxwood all together,Isaiah 60.14–19
174
to adorn my holy sanctuary, to honour
the place where I stand.
14 The sons of your oppressors will come
forward to do homage, all who reviled
you will bow low at your feet; they will
address you as City of the LORD, Zion of
the Holy One of Israel.
15 No longer will you be deserted, like a
wife hated and neglected; I shall make
you an object of everlasting acclaim, and
a source of never-ending joy.
16 You will suck the milk of nations and
be suckled at royal breasts. Then you
will know that I, the LORD, am your
Deliverer; your Redeemer is the Mighty
One of Jacob.
17 For copper I shall bring you gold
and for iron I shall bring silver, copper
for timber and iron for stone; I shall
appoint peace to govern you and make
righteousness rule over you.
18 No longer will the sound of violence
be heard in your land, nor havoc and
ruin within your borders; but you will
name your walls Deliverance and your
gates Praise.
19 The sun will no longer be your light
by day, nor the moon shine on you byIsaiah 60.20–61.3
175
night; the LORD will be your everlasting
light, your God will be your splendour.
20 Never again will your sun set nor
your moon withdraw her light; but the
LORD will be your everlasting light and
your days of mourning will be ended.
21 Your people, all of them righteous,
will possess the land for ever. They are a
shoot of my own planting, a work of my
own hands for my adornment.
22 The few will become a thousand; the
handful, a great nation. At its appointed
time I the LORD shall bring this swiftly
to pass.
1 The spirit of the Lord GOD
is upon me because the LORD
has anointed me; he has sent me to
announce good news to the humble, to
bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim
liberty to captives, release to those in
prison;
2 to proclaim a year of the LORD's
favour and a day of the vengeance of
our God; to comfort all who mourn,
3 to give them garlands instead of
ashes, oil of gladness instead of
mourners' tears, a garment of splendour
for the heavy heart. They will be called
61Isaiah 61.4–9
176
trees of righteousness, planted by the
LORD for his adornment.
4 Buildings long in ruins will be rebuilt
and sites long desolate restored; they
will repair the ruined cities which for
generations have lain desolate.
5 Foreigners will serve as shepherds of
your flocks, aliens will till your land and
tend your vines,
6 but you will be called priests of the
LORD and be named ministers of our
God. You will enjoy the wealth of nations
and succeed to their riches.
7 And so, because shame in double
measure and insults and abuse have
been my people's lot, they will receive
in their own land a double measure of
wealth, and everlasting joy will be theirs.
8 For I the LORD love justice and hate
robbery and crime; I shall grant them
a sure reward and make an everlasting
covenant with them;
9 their posterity will be renowned
among the nations and their descendants
among the peoples; all who see them
will acknowledge that they are a race
blessed by the LORD.Isaiah 61.10–62.4
177
10 Let me rejoice in the LORD with all
my heart, let me exult in my God; for he
has robed me in deliverance and arrayed
me in victory, like a bridegroom with his
garland, or a bride decked in her jewels.
11 As the earth puts forth her blossom or
plants in the garden burst into flower, so
will the Lord GOD make his victory and
renown blossom before all the nations.
1 For Zion's sake I shall not keep
silent, for Jerusalem's sake I shall
not be quiet, until her victory shines
forth like the sunrise, her deliverance
like a blazing torch,
2 and the nations see your victory and
all their kings your glory. Then you will
be called by a new name which the LORD
himself will announce;
3 you will be a glorious crown in the
LORD's hand, a royal diadem held by
your God.
4 No more will you be called Forsaken,
no more will your land be called Desolate,
but you will be named Hephzibah and
your land Beulah; for the LORD will take
delight in you and to him your land will
be linked in wedlock.
62Isaiah 62.5–11
178
5 As a young man weds a maiden, so
will you be wedded to him who rebuilds
you, and as a bridegroom rejoices over
the bride, so will your God rejoice over
you.
6 Jerusalem, on your walls I have posted
watchmen, who day and night without
ceasing will cry: You that invoke the
LORD's name, take no rest,
7 and give no rest to him until he makes
Jerusalem a theme of praise throughout
the world.
8 The LORD has sworn with raised right
hand and mighty arm: Never again will I
give your grain to feed your foes, never
again let foreigners drink the vintage for
which you have toiled;
9 but those who harvest the grain will
eat it and give praise to the LORD, and
those who gather the grapes will drink
the wine within my sacred courts.
10 Pass through the gates, go out, clear
a road for my people; build a highway,
build it up, remove the boulders; hoist a
signal for the peoples.
11 This is the LORD's proclamation
to earth's farthest bounds: Tell the
daughter of Zion, See, your deliveranceIsaiah 62.12–63.5
179
comes. His reward is with him, his
recompense before him.
12 They will be called the Holy People,
the Redeemed of the LORD; and you will
be called Sought After, City No Longer
Forsaken.
1 WHO is this coming from Edom,
from Bozrah with his garments
stained red, one splendidly attired,
striding along with mighty power? It is I,
proclaiming victory, I, who am strong to
save.
2 Why are your clothes all red, like the
garments of one treading grapes in the
winepress?
3 I have trodden the press alone, for
none of my people was with me. I trod
the nations in my anger, I trampled them
in my fury, and their blood bespattered
my garments and all my clothing was
stained.
4 I resolved on a day of vengeance; the
year for redeeming my own had come.
5 I looked for a helper but found none;
I was outraged that no one upheld me;
yet my own might brought me victory,
my fury alone upheld me.
63Isaiah 63.6–12
180
6 I stamped on peoples in my anger, I
shattered them in my fury and spilled
their blood over the ground.
7 I shall recount the LORD's unfailing
love, the prowess of the LORD, according
to all he has done for us, his great
goodness to the house of Israel, what he
has done for them in his tenderness and
by his many acts of faithful love.
8 He said, Surely they are my people,
children who will not play me false; and
he became their deliverer
9 in all their troubles. No envoy, no
angel, but he himself delivered them,
redeemed them in his love and pity; he
lifted them up and carried them through
all the days of old.
10 Yet they rebelled and grieved his holy
spirit; so he turned hostile to them and
himself fought against them.
11 Then they recalled days long past
and him who drew out his people: where
is he who brought up from the Nile the
shepherd of his flock? Where is he who
put within him his holy spirit,
12 who sent his glorious power to walk
at Moses' right hand? Where is he whoIsaiah 63.13–18
181
divided the waters before them, to win
for himself everlasting renown,
13 who brought them through the deep
sure-footed as horses in open country,
14 like cattle moving down into a valley
guided by the spirit of the LORD? Thus
you led your people to win yourself a
glorious name.
15 Look down from heaven and see from
the heights where you dwell holy and
glorious. Where is your zeal, your valour,
your burning and tender love? Do not
stand aloof,
16 for you are our Father. Though
Abraham were not to know us nor Israel
to acknowledge us, you, LORD, are our
Father; our Redeemer from of old is your
name.
17 Why, LORD, do you let us wander
from your ways and harden our hearts
until we cease to fear you? Turn again
for the sake of your servants, the tribes
that are your possession.
18 Why have the wicked trespassed on
your sanctuary, why have our enemies
trampled on your shrine?Isaiah 63.19–64.6
182
19 We have long been reckoned as
beyond your sway, as if we had not been
named your own.
1 Why did you not tear asunder
the heavens and come down,
that, when you appeared, the mountains
might shake,
2 that fire might blaze as it blazes in
brushwood when it makes water boil?
Then would your name be known to your
adversaries, and nations would tremble
before you.
3 You surprised us with awesome
things; the mountains shook when you
appeared.
4 Never has ear heard or eye seen any
other god who acts for those who wait
for him.
5 You welcome him who rejoices to do
what is right, who is mindful of your
ways. When you showed your anger, we
sinned and, in spite of it, we have done
evil from of old.
6 We all became like something unclean
and all our righteous deeds were like
a filthy rag; we have all withered like
leaves and our iniquities carry us away
like the wind.
64Isaiah 64.7–65.2
183
7 There is no one who invokes you by
name or rouses himself to hold fast to
you; for you have hidden your face from
us and left us in the grip of our iniquities.
8 Yet, LORD, you are our Father; we are
the clay, you the potter, and all of us are
your handiwork.
9 Do not let your anger pass all bounds,
LORD, and do not remember iniquity for
ever; look on us all, look on your people.
10 Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion
a wilderness, Jerusalem desolate;
11 our holy and glorious sanctuary, in
which our forefathers praised you, has
been burnt to the ground and all that we
cherished lies in ruins.
12 Despite this, LORD, will you stand
aloof, will you keep silent and punish us
beyond measure?
1 I WAS ready to respond, but no
one asked, ready to be found,
but no one sought me. I said, Here am
I! Here am I! to a nation that did not
invoke me by name.
2 All day long I held out my hands
appealing to a rebellious people who
went their evil way, in pursuit of their
own devices;
65Isaiah 65.3–9
184
3 they were a people who provoked me
perpetually to my face, offering sacrifice
in the gardens, burning incense on brick
altars.
4 They crouch among graves, keeping
vigil all night long, eating the flesh of
pigs, their cauldrons full of a foul brew.
5 Keep clear! they cry, Do not touch
me, for my holiness will infect you. Such
people are a smouldering fire, smoke in
my nostrils all day long.
6 Your record lies before me; I shall not
keep silent; I shall fully repay
7 your iniquities, both yours and your
forefathers', says the LORD, for having
sacrificed on the mountains and shamed
me on the hills; I shall first measure out
their reward and then repay them in full.
8 These are the words of the LORD:
As there is juice in a cluster of grapes
and folk say, Do not destroy it; there is
blessing in it, so shall I act for the sake
of my servants: I shall not destroy the
whole nation.
9 I shall give descendants to Jacob,
and to Judah heirs who will possess my
mountains; my chosen ones will takeIsaiah 65.10–15
185
possession of the land, and those who
serve me will live there.
10 Flocks will range over Sharon, and
the valley of Achor become a pasture
for cattle; they will belong to my people
who seek me.
11 But you that forsake the LORD and
ignore my holy mountain, who spread a
table for the god of Fate, and fill bowls
of spiced wine in honour of Destiny,
12 I shall destine you for the sword, and
you will all submit to slaughter, because,
when I called, you did not respond, when
I spoke, you would not listen. You did
what was wrong in my sight, and chose
what displeased me.
13 Therefore these are the words of the
Lord GOD: My servants will eat, while
you go hungry; my servants will drink,
while you go thirsty; my servants will
rejoice, while you are put to shame;
14 my servants in the gladness of their
hearts will shout for joy, while you cry
from an aching heart and wail from
anguish of spirit.
15 Your name will be used as a curse by
my chosen ones: May the Lord GOD giveIsaiah 65.16–20
186
you over to death! but his servants he
will call by another name.
16 Anyone in the land invoking a
blessing on himself will do so by God
whose name is Amen, and anyone in the
land taking an oath will do so by God
whose name is Amen, for past troubles
are forgotten; they have vanished from
my sight.
17 See, I am creating new heavens and
a new earth! The past will no more be
remembered nor will it ever come to
mind.
18 Rejoice and be for ever filled with
delight at what I create; for I am creating
Jerusalem as a delight and her people as
a joy;
19 I shall take delight in Jerusalem
and rejoice in my people; the sound of
weeping, the cry of distress will be heard
in her no more.
20 No child there will ever again die in
infancy, no old man fail to live out his
span of life. He who dies at a hundred is
just a youth, and if he does not attain a
hundred he is thought accursed!Isaiah 65.21–66.2
187
21 My people will build houses and live
in them, plant vineyards and eat their
fruit;
22 they will not build for others to live in
or plant for others to eat. They will be as
long-lived as a tree, and my chosen ones
will enjoy the fruit of their labour.
23 They will not toil to no purpose or
raise children for misfortune, because
they and their issue after them are a
race blessed by the LORD.
24 Even before they call to me, I shall
answer, and while they are still speaking
I shall respond.
25 The wolf and the lamb will feed
together and the lion will eat straw like
the ox, and as for the serpent, its food
will be dust. Neither hurt nor harm will
be done in all my holy mountain, says
the LORD.
1 These are the words of the
LORD: The heavens are my
throne and the earth is my footstool.
Where will you build a house for me,
where will my resting-place be?
2 These are all of my own making, and
all belong to me. This is the word of the
LORD. The one for whom I have regard is
66Isaiah 66.3–6
188
oppressed and afflicted, one who reveres
my word.
3 Sacrificing an ox is like killing a man,
slaughtering a sheep like breaking
a dog's neck, making an offering of
grain like offering pigs' blood, burning
frankincense as a token like worshipping
an idol. Because people have adopted
these practices and revelled in loathsome
rites,
4 I in turn shall adopt a wilful course
and bring on them the very things
they dread, since, when I called, no
one responded, when I spoke, no one
listened. They did what was wrong in my
sight and chose what displeased me.
5 Hear the word of the LORD, you
that revere his word: Your fellow-
countrymen, who are hostile to you and
spurn you because you bear my name,
have said, Let the LORD show his glory,
that we may see you rejoice! But they
themselves will be put to shame.
6 That roar from the city, that uproar in
the temple, is the sound of the LORD
dealing retribution to his foes.Isaiah 66.7–13
189
7 Without birth-pains Zion has given
birth, borne a son before the onset of
labour.
8 Who has heard of anything like this?
Who has witnessed such a thing? Can
a country be born in a single day, a
nation be brought to birth in a trice? Yet
Zion, at the onset of her pangs, bore her
children.
9 Shall I bring to the point of birth and
not deliver? says the LORD; shall I who
deliver close the womb? says your God
10 Rejoice with Jerusalem and exult in
her, all you that love her; share her joy
with all your heart, all you that mourned
over her.
11 Then you may suck comfort from her
and be satisfied, taking with enjoyment
her plentiful milk.
12 These are the words of the LORD:
I shall make prosperity flow over her
like a river, and the wealth of nations
like a stream in spate; her babes will be
carried in her arms and dandled on her
knees.
13 As a mother comforts her son so shall
I myself comfort you; in Jerusalem you
will find comfort.Isaiah 66.14–19
190
14 At the sight your heart will be glad,
you will flourish like grass in spring; the
LORD will make his power known among
his servants and his indignation felt
among his foes.
15 See, the LORD is coming in fire,
his chariots like a whirlwind, bringing
retribution with his furious anger and
with the flaming fire of his rebukes.
16 The LORD will judge with fire, by his
sword he will test all mankind, and many
will be slain by him.
17 Those who consecrate and purify
themselves for garden-rites, one after
another in a magic ring, those who eat
swine flesh, rats, and vile vermin will all
meet their end, says the LORD,
18 for I know their deeds and their
thoughts. I am coming to gather peoples
of every tongue; they will come to see
my glory.
19 I shall put a sign on them, and those
survivors I shall send to the nations,
to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, to Meshech,
Rosh, Tubal, and Javan, distant shores
which have never yet heard of me or
seen my glory; these will declare that
glory among the nations.Isaiah 66.20–24
191
20 From every nation your countrymen
will be brought on horses, in chariots
and wagons, on mules and dromedaries,
as an offering to the LORD on my holy
mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD,
just as the Israelites themselves bring
grain-offerings in purified vessels to the
LORD's house;
21 and some of them I shall take for
priests and for Levites, says the LORD.
22 As the new heavens and the new
earth which I am making will endure
before me, says the LORD, so will your
posterity and your name endure.
23 Month after month at the new moon,
week after week on the sabbath, all
mankind will come to bow before me,
says the LORD.
24 As they go out they will see the
corpses of those who rebelled against
me, where the devouring worm never
dies and the fire is not quenched. All
mankind will view them with horror.Jeremiah
1 THE words of Jeremiah son of
1 Hilkiah, one of the priests at
Anathoth in Benjamin.
2 The word of the LORD came to him in
the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah
son of Amon, king of Judah.
3 It came also during the reign of
Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah,
until the end of the eleventh year of
Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah.
In the fifth month the inhabitants of
Jerusalem were carried off into exile.
4 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
5 Before I formed you in the womb I
chose you, and before you were born
I consecrated you; I appointed you a
prophet to the nations.
6 Ah! Lord GOD, I answered, I am not
skilled in speaking; I am too young.
7 But the LORD said, Do not plead that
you are too young; for you are to go to
whatever people I send you, and say
whatever I tell you to say.Jeremiah 1.8–15
2
8 Fear none of them, for I shall be with
you to keep you safe. This was the word
of the LORD.
9 Then the LORD stretched out his hand,
and touching my mouth said to me, See,
I put my words into your mouth.
10 This day I give you authority over
nations and kingdoms to uproot and to
pull down, to destroy and to demolish,
to build and to plant.
11 The word of the LORD came to me:
What is it that you see, Jeremiah? A
branch of an almond tree, I answered.
12 You are right, said the LORD to me,
for I am on the watch to carry out my
threat.
13 The word of the LORD came to me a
second time: What is it that you see? A
cauldron on a fire, I said; it is fanned by
the wind and tilted away from the north.
14 The LORD said: From the north
disaster will be let loose against all who
live in the land.
15 For now I am summoning all the
peoples of the kingdoms of the north,
says the LORD; their kings will come and
each will set his throne in place before
the gates of Jerusalem; they will encircleJeremiah 1.16–2.2
3
her walls and besiege every town in
Judah.
16 I shall state my case against my
people for all their wickedness in
forsaking me, in burning sacrifices to
other gods, and in worshipping the work
of their own hands.
17 Brace yourself, Jeremiah; stand up
and speak to them. Tell them everything
I bid you; when you confront them do
not let your spirit break, or I shall break
you before their eyes.
18 This day I make you a fortified city,
an iron pillar, a bronze wall, to withstand
the whole land, the kings and princes of
Judah, its priests, and its people.
19 Though they attack you, they will not
prevail, for I shall be with you to keep
you safe. This is the word of the LORD.
1 THE word of the LORD came to me:
2 Go, make this proclamation in the
hearing of Jerusalem: These are the
words of the LORD: I remember in your
favour the loyalty of your youth, your
love during your bridal days, when you
followed me through the wilderness,
through a land unsown.
2Jeremiah 2.3–8
4
3 Israel was holy to the LORD, the
firstfruits of his harvest; no one who
devoured her went unpunished, disaster
overtook them. This is the word of the
LORD.
4 Listen to the word of the LORD, people
of Jacob, all you families of Israel.
5 These are the words of the LORD:
What fault did your forefathers find
in me, that they went so far astray
from me, pursuing worthless idols and
becoming worthless like them;
6 that they did not ask, Where is the
LORD, who brought us up from Egypt
and led us through the wilderness,
through a barren and broken country, a
country parched and forbidding, where
no one ever travelled, where no one
made his home?
7 I brought you into a fertile land to
enjoy its fruit and every good thing in
it; but when you entered my land you
defiled it and made loathsome the home
I gave you.
8 The priests no longer asked, Where
is the LORD? Those who handled the
law had no real knowledge of me, the
shepherds of the people rebelled againstJeremiah 2.9–15
5
me; the prophets prophesied in the
name of Baal and followed gods who
were powerless to help.
9 Therefore I shall bring a charge
against you once more, says the
LORD, against you and against your
descendants.
10 Cross to the coasts and islands
of Kittim and see, send to Kedar and
observe closely, see whether there has
been anything like this:
11 has a nation ever exchanged its gods,
and these no gods at all? Yet my people
have exchanged their glory for a god
altogether powerless.
12 Be aghast at this, you heavens,
shudder in utter horror, says the LORD.
13 My people have committed two sins:
they have rejected me, a source of
living water, and they have hewn out for
themselves cisterns, cracked cisterns
which hold no water.
14 Is Israel a slave? Was he born in
slavery? If not, why has he become
spoil?
15 Lions roar loudly at him; his land has
been laid waste, his towns razed to the
ground and abandoned.Jeremiah 2.16–22
6
16 The people of Noph and Tahpanhes
will break your heads.
17 Is it not your rejection of the LORD
your God when he guided you on the
way that brings all this upon you?
18 And now, why should you make off
to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile?
Or why make off to Assyria to drink the
waters of the Euphrates?
19 It is your own wickedness that will
punish you, your own apostasy that will
condemn you. See for yourselves how
bitter a thing it is and how evil, to reject
the LORD your God, to hold me in dread
no longer. This is the word of the Lord
GOD of Hosts.
20 Many ages ago you shattered your
yoke and snapped your traces, crying,
I will not serve you; and you sprawled
in promiscuous vice on all the hilltops,
under every spreading tree.
21 I planted you as a choice red vine,
a wholly pure strain, yet now you are
turned into a vine that has reverted to
its wild state!
22 Though you wash with soda and use
soap lavishly, the stain of your sin is stillJeremiah 2.23–27
7
there for me to see. This is the word of
the Lord GOD.
23 How can you say, I am not defiled; I
have not followed the baalim? Look at
your conduct in the valley; recall what
you have done: you have been like a
she-camel, twisting and turning as she
runs,
24 rushing off into the wilderness,
snuffing the wind in her lust; in her heat
who can restrain her? None need tire
themselves out in pursuit of her; she is
easily found at mating time.
25 Stop before your feet are bare and
your throat is parched. But you said, No;
I am desperate. I love foreign gods and
I must go after them.
26 As a thief is ashamed when he is
found out, so the people of Israel feel
ashamed, they, their kings, their princes,
their priests, and their prophets,
27 who say to a block of wood, You are
our father and cry Mother to a stone.
On me they have turned their backs and
averted their faces from me. Yet in their
time of trouble they say, Rise up and
save us!Jeremiah 2.28–35
8
28 Where are the gods you made for
yourselves? In your time of trouble let
them arise and save you. For you, Judah,
have as many gods as you have towns.
29 Why argue your case with me? You
are rebels, every one of you. This is the
word of the LORD.
30 In vain I punished your people --
the lesson was not learnt; your sword
devoured your prophets like a ravening
lion.
31 Have I shown myself to Israel as
some wilderness or waterless land?
Why do my people say, We have broken
away; we shall come to you no more?
32 Will a girl forget her finery or a bride
her wedding ribbons? Yet times without
number my people have forgotten me.
33 You pick your way so well in search
of lovers; even wanton women can learn
from you.
34 Yes, and there is blood on the corners
of your robe -- the life-blood of the
innocent poor, though you did not catch
them housebreaking. For all these things
I shall punish you.
35 You say, I am innocent; surely his
anger has passed away. But I shallJeremiah 2.36–3.4
9
challenge your claim to have done no
sin.
36 Why do you so lightly change your
course? You will be let down by Egypt as
you were by Assyria;
37 you will go into exile from here with
your hands on your heads, for the LORD
rejects those on whom you rely, and
from them you will gain nothing.
1 If a man divorces his wife and she
leaves him, and if she then becomes
another's, may he go back to her again?
Is not that woman defiled, a forbidden
thing? You have been unfaithful with
many lovers, says the LORD, and yet
you would come back to me?
2 Look up to the bare heights and see:
where have you not been lain with?
Like an Arab lurking in the desert you
sat by the wayside to catch lovers; you
defiled the land with your adultery and
debauchery.
3 Therefore the showers were withheld
and the spring rain failed. But yours was
a prostitute's brazenness, and you were
resolved to show no shame.
4 Not so long since you called me Father,
teacher of my youth,
3Jeremiah 3.5–10
10
5 thinking, Will he keep up his anger for
ever? Will he rage to the end? This is
how you spoke, but you have done evil
and gone unchallenged.
6 In the reign of King Josiah the LORD
said to me: Do you see what apostate
Israel has done, how she went to every
hilltop and under every spreading tree,
and there committed adultery?
7 Even after she had done all this I
thought she would come back to me, but
she did not. That faithless woman, her
sister Judah, saw it;
8 she saw too that I had put apostate
Israel away and given her a certificate
of divorce because she had committed
adultery. Yet that faithless woman, her
sister Judah, was not afraid; she too
went and committed adultery.
9 She defiled the land with her casual
prostitution and her adulterous worship
of stone and wood.
10 In spite of all this Judah, that faithless
woman, has not come back to me in
sincerity, but only in pretence. This is
the word of the LORD.Jeremiah 3.11–16
11
11 The LORD said to me: Apostate
Israel is less to blame than that faithless
woman Judah.
12 Go and proclaim this message
towards the north: Come back, apostate
Israel, says the LORD; I shall no longer
frown on you. For my love is unfailing,
says the LORD; I shall not keep up my
anger for ever.
13 Only acknowledge your wrongdoing,
your rebellion against the LORD your
God, your promiscuous traffic with
foreign gods under every spreading tree,
and your disobedience to my commands.
This is the word of the LORD.
14 Come back, apostate people, says
the LORD, for I am patient with you, and
I shall take you, one from each city and
two from each clan, and bring you to
Zion.
15 There I shall give you shepherds after
my own heart, and they will lead you
with knowledge and understanding.
16 In those days, when you have
increased and become fruitful in the
land, says the LORD, no one will speak
any more of the Ark of the Covenant
of the LORD; no one will think of it orJeremiah 3.17–22
12
remember it or resort to it; that will be
done no more.
17 At that time Jerusalem will be called
the Throne of the LORD, and all nations
will gather in Jerusalem to honour the
LORD's name; never again will they
follow the promptings of their evil and
stubborn hearts.
18 In those days Judah will be united
with Israel, and together they will come
from a northern land into the land I gave
their fathers as their holding.
19 I said: How gladly would I treat you
as a son, giving you a pleasant land, a
holding fairer than that of any nation!
You would call me Father, I thought, and
never cease to follow me.
20 But like a woman who through illicit
love has been unfaithful, so you, Israel,
were unfaithful to me. This is the word
of the LORD.
21 Weeping is heard on the bare places,
Israel's people pleading for mercy,
because they have taken to crooked
ways and ignored the LORD their God.
22 Come back, you apostate people; I
shall heal your apostasy. Here we areJeremiah 3.23–4.3
13
coming to you, for you are the LORD our
God.
23 There is no help in worship on the
hilltops, no help from clamour on the
heights; truly in the LORD our God lies
Israel's salvation.
24 From our early days Baal has
devoured the fruits of our fathers'
labours, their flocks and herds, their
sons and daughters.
25 Let us lie down in our shame, covered
by dishonour, for we have sinned against
the LORD our God, both we and our
fathers, from our early days even till
now, and we have not obeyed the LORD
our God.
1 Israel, if you will come back, if you
will come back to me, says the LORD,
if you will banish your loathsome idols
from my sight, and go astray no more,
2 if you swear by the life of the LORD in
truth, justice, and uprightness, then the
nations will pray to be blessed like you
and in you they will boast.
3 These are the words of the LORD to the
people of Judah and Jerusalem: Break
up your ground that lies unploughed, do
not sow among thorns;
4Jeremiah 4.4–9
14
4 circumcise yourselves to the service
of the LORD, circumcise your hearts,
you people of Judah, you dwellers in
Jerusalem, or the fire of my fury may
blaze up and burn unquenched, because
of your evil actions.
5 Declare this in Judah, proclaim it in
Jerusalem. Blow the trumpet throughout
the land. Shout aloud the command:
Assemble! Let us move back to the
fortified towns.
6 Raise the signal -- to Zion! Make for
safety without delay, for I am about to
bring disaster out of the north and dire
destruction.
7 A lion has risen from his lair, the
destroyer of nations; he has broken
camp and marched out to devastate
your land and make your cities waste
and empty.
8 Therefore put on sackcloth, beat the
breast and wail, for the fierce anger of
the LORD is not averted from us.
9 On that day, says the LORD, the
courage of the king and his officers will
fail, priests will be aghast and prophets
appalled.Jeremiah 4.10–17
15
10 I said: Ah, Lord GOD, you surely
deceived this people and Jerusalem in
promising peace while the sword is at
our throats.
11 At that time this people and
Jerusalem will be told: A scorching wind
from the desert heights sweeps down on
my people; it is no breeze for winnowing
or for cleansing.
12 A wind too strong for these will come
at my bidding, and now I shall state my
case against my people.
13 Like clouds the enemy advances, like
a whirlwind with his chariots; his horses
are swifter than eagles: Woe to us, for
we are lost!
14 Jerusalem, cleanse the wrongdoing
from your heart and you may yet be
saved. How long will you harbour within
you your evil schemes?
15 News comes from Dan, evil tidings
from Mount Ephraim.
16 Tell this to the nations, proclaim the
doom of Jerusalem: hordes of invaders
are on the way from a distant land,
giving voice against the cities of Judah.
17 As a field surrounded by guards she
is encircled by them, because she hasJeremiah 4.18–24
16
rebelled against me. This is the word of
the LORD.
18 Your own ways and deeds have
brought these things on you; this is your
punishment, for your rebellion is seated
deep within you.
19 Oh, how I writhe in anguish, how my
heart throbs! I cannot keep silence, for
I hear the sound of the trumpet, the
clamour of the battle cry.
20 Crash follows crash, for the whole
land goes down in ruin. Suddenly my
tents are thrown down, the curtains in
an instant.
21 How long must I see the standard
raised and hear the trumpet-call?
22 My people are foolish, they know
nothing of me; senseless children,
lacking all understanding, clever only
in wrongdoing, but of doing right they
know nothing.
23 I looked at the earth, and it was
chaos, at the heavens, and their light
was gone,
24 at the mountains, and they were
reeling, and all the hills rocked to and
fro.Jeremiah 4.25–31
17
25 I looked: no one was there, and all
the birds of heaven had taken wing.
26 I looked: the fertile land was
wilderness, its towns all razed to the
ground before the LORD, before his
fierce anger.
27 These are the words of the LORD:
The whole land will be desolate, and I
shall make an end of it.
28 The earth will be in mourning for this
and the heavens above turn black; for
I have made known my purpose, and I
shall not relent or change it.
29 At the sound of the horsemen and
archers every town is in flight; people
crawl into the thickets, scramble up
among the crags. Every town is deserted,
no one lives there.
30 And you, what are you doing? When
you dress yourself in scarlet, deck
yourself out with gold ornaments, and
enlarge your eyes with antimony, you
are beautifying yourself to no purpose.
Your lovers spurn you and seek your life.
31 I hear a sound as of a woman in
labour, the sharp cry of one bearing her
first child. It is Zion, gasping for breath,Jeremiah 5.1–6
18
stretching out her hands. Ah me! she
cries. I am weary, weary of slaughter.
1 Go up and down the streets of
Jerusalem, see, take note; search
through her wide squares: can you find
anyone who acts justly, anyone who
seeks the truth, that I may forgive that
city?
2 People may swear by the life of
the LORD, but in fact they perjure
themselves.
3 LORD, are your eyes not set upon
the truth? You punished them, but they
took no heed; you pierced them to the
heart, but they refused to learn. They
made their faces harder than flint; they
refused to repent.
4 I said, After all, these are the poor,
these are folk without understanding,
who do not know the way of the LORD,
the ordinances of their God.
5 I shall go to the great ones and speak
with them; for they will know the way of
the LORD, the ordinances of their God.
But they too have broken the yoke and
snapped their traces.
6 So a lion out of the scrub will strike
them down, a wolf from the plains will
5Jeremiah 5.7–13
19
savage them; a leopard will prowl about
their towns and maul any who venture
out, for their rebellious deeds are many,
their apostasies past counting.
7 How can I forgive you for all this? Your
children have forsaken me, swearing
by gods that are no gods. I gave them
all they needed, yet they committed
adultery and frequented brothels;
8 each neighs after another man's wife,
like a well-fed and lusty stallion.
9 Shall I fail to punish them for this, says
the LORD, shall I not exact vengeance
on such a people?
10 Go along her rows of vines; destroy
them, make an end of them. Lop off her
green branches, for they are not the
LORD's.
11 Faithless are Israel and Judah, both
faithless to me. This is the word of the
LORD.
12 They have denied the LORD, saying,
He does not matter. No harm will come
to us; we shall see neither sword nor
famine.
13 The prophets will prove mere wind;
the word is not in them.Jeremiah 5.14–20
20
14 Therefore, because they talk in this
way, these are the words of the LORD
the God of Hosts to me: I shall make my
words a fire in your mouth, and it will
burn up this people like brushwood.
15 Israel, I am bringing against you
a distant nation, an ancient people
established long ago, says the LORD, a
people whose language you do not know,
whose speech you will not understand;
16 they are all mighty warriors, their
jaws are a grave, wide open,
17 to devour your harvest and your food,
to devour your sons and your daughters,
to devour your flocks and your herds,
to devour your vines and your fig trees.
They will beat down with the sword the
walled cities in which you trust.
18 But in those days, the LORD declares,
I shall not make an end of you.
19 When it is asked, Why has the LORD
our God done all this to us? you are to
answer, As you have forsaken the LORD
and served alien gods in your own land,
so you will serve foreigners in a land that
is not your own.
20 Announce this to the people of Jacob,
proclaim it in Judah:Jeremiah 5.21–27
21
21 Listen, you foolish and senseless
people, who have eyes and see nothing,
ears and hear nothing.
22 Have you no fear of me, says the
LORD, will you not tremble before me,
who set the sand as bounds for the sea,
a limit it never can pass? Its waves may
heave and toss, but they are powerless;
roar as they may, they cannot pass.
23 But this people has a rebellious and
defiant heart; they have rebelled and
gone their own way.
24 They did not say to themselves, Let
us fear the LORD our God, who gives the
rains of autumn and spring showers in
their turn, who brings us unfailingly fixed
harvest seasons.
25 But your wrongdoing has upset
nature's order, and your sins have kept
away her bounty.
26 For among my people there are
scoundrels who, like fowlers, lay snares
and set deadly traps; they prey on their
fellows.
27 Their houses are full of fraud, as a
cage is full of birds. They grow great and
rich,Jeremiah 5.28–6.4
22
28 sleek and bloated; they turn a blind
eye to wickedness and refuse to do
justice; the claims of the fatherless they
do not uphold, nor do they defend the
poor at law.
29 Shall I fail to punish them for
this, says the LORD; shall I not exact
vengeance on such a people?
30 An appalling thing, an outrage, has
appeared in this land:
31 prophets prophesy lies and priests
are in league with them, and my people
love to have it so! How will you fare at
the end of it all?
1 People of Benjamin, save
yourselves, flee from Jerusalem;
sound the trumpet in Tekoa, light the
beacon on Beth-hakkerem, for calamity
looms from the north and great disaster.
2 Zion, delightful and lovely, her end is
near --
3 she against whom the shepherds will
come, they and their flocks with them.
They will pitch their tents all around her,
each grazing his own strip of pasture:
4 Prepare for battle against her; come,
let us attack her at noon. Too late! The
day declines and the shadows lengthen.
6Jeremiah 6.5–11
23
5 Come then, let us attack by night and
destroy her palaces.
6 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Cut down the trees of Jerusalem
and cast up siege-ramps against her, a
city ripe for punishment; oppression is
rampant within her.
7 As a well keeps its water fresh, so she
keeps fresh her wickedness. Violence
and outrage echo in her streets; sickness
and wounds ever confront me.
8 Learn your lesson, Jerusalem, or
I shall be estranged from you, and
leave you devastated, a land without
inhabitants.
9 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Glean like a vine the remnant
of Israel; one last time, like a vintager,
pass your hand over the branches.
10 To whom shall I speak, to whom
give warning? Who will hear me? Their
ears are blocked: they are incapable of
listening; they treat the LORD's word as
a reproach; it has no appeal for them.
11 But I am full of the anger of the
LORD, I cannot hold it back. I must pour
it out on the children in the street, on
the young men in their gatherings. ManJeremiah 6.12–16
24
and wife alike will be caught in it, the
ageing and the aged.
12 Their houses will be turned over
to others, fields and women together,
because, says the LORD, I shall raise my
hand against the inhabitants of the land.
13 For all, high and low, are out for
ill-gotten gain; prophets and priests are
frauds, every one of them;
14 they dress my people's wound, but
on the surface only, with their saying, All
is well. All well? Nothing is well!
15 They ought to be ashamed because
they practised abominations; yet they
have no sense of shame, they could
never be put out of countenance.
Therefore they will fall with a great
crash, and be brought to the ground on
the day of my reckoning. The LORD has
said it.
16 These are the words of the LORD:
Take your stand and watch at the
crossroads; enquire about the ancient
paths; ask which is the way that leads to
what is good. Take that way, and you will
find rest for yourselves. But they said,
We refuse.Jeremiah 6.17–23
25
17 I appointed watchmen to direct them.
Listen for the trumpet-call, I used to say.
But they said, We refuse.
18 Therefore hear, you nations, and all
who witness it take note of the plight of
this people.
19 Let the earth listen: I am about to
bring ruin on them, the fruit of all their
scheming; for they have given no heed
to my words and have spurned my
instruction.
20 What good is it to me if frankincense
is brought from Sheba and fragrant cane
from a distant land? Your whole-offerings
are not acceptable to me, your sacrifices
do not please me.
21 Therefore these are the words of
the LORD: I shall set obstacles before
this people which will bring them to the
ground; fathers and sons, friends and
neighbours will all perish together.
22 These are the words of the LORD:
See, an army is coming from a northern
land, a great nation rouses itself from
earth's farthest corners.
23 Armed with bow and scimitar, they
are cruel and pitiless; bestriding their
horses, they sound like the thunder ofJeremiah 6.24–7.2
26
the sea; they are like men arrayed for
battle against you, Zion.
24 News of them has reached us and our
hands hang limp; agony grips us, pangs
as of a woman in labour.
25 Do not go out into the country, do not
walk by the high road; for the foe, sword
in hand, spreads terror all around.
26 Daughter of my people, wrap
yourself in sackcloth, sprinkle ashes
over yourself, wail bitterly as one who
mourns an only son; for in an instant the
despoiler will be upon us.
27 I have appointed you an assayer and
tester of my people; you will know how
to assay their conduct:
28 arch-rebels all of them, mischief-
makers, corrupt to a man.
29 The bellows blow, the fire is ready;
lead, copper, and iron -- in vain the
refiner refines; the impurities are not
removed.
30 Call them reject silver, for the LORD
has rejected them.
1 THIS word came from the LORD to
Jeremiah.
2 Stand at the gate of the LORD's house
and there make this proclamation: Hear
7Jeremiah 7.3–10
27
the word of the LORD, all you of Judah
who come in through these gates to
worship him.
3 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: Amend your
ways and your deeds, that I may let you
live in this place.
4 You keep saying, This place is the
temple of the LORD, the temple of the
LORD, the temple of the LORD! This
slogan of yours is a lie; put no trust in it.
5 If you amend your ways and your
deeds, deal fairly with one another,
6 cease to oppress the alien, the
fatherless, and the widow, if you shed no
innocent blood in this place and do not
run after other gods to your own ruin,
7 then I shall let you live in this place,
in the land which long ago I gave to your
forefathers for all time.
8 You gain nothing by putting your trust
in this lie.
9 You steal, you murder, you commit
adultery and perjury, you burn sacrifices
to Baal, and you run after other gods
whom you have not known;
10 will you then come and stand before
me in this house which bears my name,Jeremiah 7.11–16
28
and say, We are safe? Safe, you think, to
indulge in all these abominations!
11 Do you regard this house which bears
my name as a bandits' cave? I warn
you, I myself have seen all this, says the
LORD.
12 Go to my shrine at Shiloh, which
once I made a dwelling for my name,
and see what I did to it because of the
wickedness of my people Israel.
13 Now you have done all these things,
says the LORD; though I spoke to you
again and again, you did not listen, and
though I called, you did not respond.
14 Therefore what I did to Shiloh I
shall do to this house which bears my
name, the house in which you put your
trust, the place I gave to you and your
forefathers;
15 I shall fling you away out of my
presence, as I did with all your kinsfolk,
all Ephraim's offspring.
16 Offer up no prayer for this people,
Jeremiah, raise no plea or prayer on
their behalf, and do not intercede with
me, for I shall not listen to you.Jeremiah 7.17–23
29
17 Do you not see what they are doing
in the towns of Judah and in the streets
of Jerusalem?
18 Children are gathering wood, fathers
lighting the fire, women kneading dough
to make crescent-cakes in honour of the
queen of heaven; and drink-offerings are
poured out to other gods -- all to grieve
me.
19 But is it I, says the LORD, whom they
grieve? No; it is themselves, to their own
confusion.
20 Therefore, says the Lord GOD, my
anger and my fury will pour out on this
place, on man and beast, on trees and
crops, and it will burn unquenched.
21 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Add your
whole-offerings to your sacrifices and
eat the flesh yourselves.
22 For when I brought your forefathers
out of Egypt, I gave them no instructions
or commands about whole-offering or
sacrifice.
23 What I did command them was
this: Obey me, and I shall be your God
and you will be my people. You mustJeremiah 7.24–29
30
conform to all my commands, if you are
to prosper.
24 But they did not listen; they paid no
heed, and persisted in their own plans
with evil and stubborn hearts; they
turned their backs and not their faces to
me,
25 from the day when your forefathers
left Egypt until now. Again and again
I sent to them all my servants the
prophets;
26 but instead of listening and paying
heed to me, they in their stubbornness
proved even more wicked than their
forefathers.
27 Tell them all this, but they will not
listen to you; call them, but they will not
respond.
28 Then say to them: This is the nation
who did not obey the LORD their God or
accept correction. Truth has perished; it
is heard no more on their lips.
29 Jerusalem, cut off your hair and
throw it away; raise a lament on the
bare heights. For the LORD has spurned
and forsaken the generation that roused
his wrath.Jeremiah 7.30–8.1
31
30 The people of Judah have done what
is wrong in my eyes, says the LORD.
They set up their loathsome idols in the
house which bears my name and so
defiled it;
31 they have built shrines of Topheth in
the valley of Ben-hinnom, at which to
burn their sons and daughters. That was
no command of mine; indeed it never
entered my mind.
32 Therefore the time is coming, says
the LORD, when it will no longer be called
Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom,
but the valley of Slaughter; for the dead
will be buried in Topheth until there is no
room left.
33 So the corpses of this people will
become food for the birds of the air and
the wild beasts, with none to scare them
away.
34 From the towns of Judah and the
streets of Jerusalem I shall banish all
sounds of joy and gladness, the voices
of bridegroom and bride; for the whole
land will become desert.
1 At that time, says the LORD, the
bones of the kings of Judah, of the
officers, priests, and prophets, and of
8Jeremiah 8.2–7
32
all who have lived in Jerusalem, will be
brought out from their graves.
2 They will be exposed to the sun, the
moon, and all the host of heaven, which
they loved and served and adored, from
which they sought guidance and to which
they bowed in worship. Those bones will
not be gathered up and reburied; they
will be dung spread over the ground.
3 All the survivors of this wicked race,
wherever I have banished them, would
rather die than live. This is the word of
the LORD of Hosts.
4 You are to say to them: These are
the words of the LORD. Does someone
fall and not get up, or default and not
return?
5 Then why are this people so wayward,
incurable in their waywardness? Why
have they persisted in their treachery
and refused to return?
6 I have listened to them and heard not
one word of truth, not one sinner crying
remorsefully, What have I done? Each
one breaks away in headlong career as a
war-horse plunges into battle.
7 The stork in the heavens knows the
time to migrate, the dove and the swiftJeremiah 8.8–13
33
and the wryneck know the season of
return; but my people do not know the
ordinances of the LORD.
8 How can you say, We are wise, we
have the law of the LORD, when scribes
with their lying pens have falsified it?
9 The wise are put to shame; they are
dismayed and entrapped. They have
spurned the word of the LORD, so what
sort of wisdom is theirs?
10 Therefore I shall give their wives
to other men and their lands to new
owners. For all, high and low, are out for
ill-gotten gain; prophets and priests are
frauds, every one of them;
11 they dress my people's wound, but
on the surface only, with their saying, All
is well. All well? Nothing is well!
12 They ought to be ashamed because
they have practised abominations, yet
they have no sense of shame, they
could never be put out of countenance.
Therefore they will fall with a great
crash, and be brought to the ground on
the day of reckoning. The LORD has said
it.
13 I shall gather them all in, says the
LORD; there will be no grapes on theJeremiah 8.14–19
34
vine, no figs on the fig tree; even the
foliage will be withered.
14 Why do we sit idle? Assemble! Let us
move to the fortified towns and there
meet our doom, since the LORD our God
has doomed us, giving us a draught of
bitter poison, for we have sinned against
him.
15 We hoped to prosper, but nothing
went well; we hoped for respite, but
terror struck.
16 The snorting of their horses is heard
from Dan; at the neighing of their
stallions the whole land trembles. The
enemy come; they devour the land and
all its store, city and citizens alike.
17 I am sending snakes against you,
vipers such as no one can charm, and
they will bite you. This is the word of the
LORD.
18 There is no cure for my grief; I am
sick at heart.
19 Hear my people's cry of distress from
a distant land: Is the LORD not in Zion?
Is her King no longer there? Why do they
provoke me with their images and with
their futile foreign gods?Jeremiah 8.20–9.5
35
20 Harvest is past, summer is over, and
we are not saved.
21 I am wounded by my people's wound;
I go about in mourning, overcome with
horror.
22 Is there no balm in Gilead, no
physician there? Why has no new skin
grown over their wound?
1 Would that my head were a spring
of water, my eyes a fountain of tears,
that I might weep day and night for the
slain of my people.
2 Would that I had in the wilderness
a wayside shelter, that I might leave
my people and go away! They are all
adulterers, a faithless mob.
3 The tongue is their weapon, a bow
ready bent. Lying, not truth, holds sway
in the land. They proceed from one
wrong to another and care nothing for
me. This is the word of the LORD.
4 Be on your guard, each against his
friend; put no trust even in a brother.
Brother supplants brother as Jacob did,
and friend slanders friend.
5 They deceive their friends and never
speak the truth; they have trained their
9Jeremiah 9.6–12
36
tongues to lying; deep in sin, they weary
themselves going astray.
6 Wrong follows wrong, deceit follows
deceit; they refuse to acknowledge me.
This is the word of the LORD.
7 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD of Hosts: I shall refine and assay
them. How else should I deal with my
people?
8 Their tongues are deadly arrows, their
mouths speak lies. One person talks
amicably to another, while inwardly
planning a trap.
9 Shall I fail to punish them for this, says
the LORD, shall I not exact vengeance
on such a people?
10 Over the mountains I shall raise
weeping and wailing, and over the open
pastures I shall chant a dirge. They are
scorched and untrodden, they hear no
lowing of cattle; birds of the air and
beasts have fled and are gone.
11 I shall make Jerusalem a heap of
ruins, a haunt of wolves, and the towns
of Judah waste, without inhabitants.
12 Who is wise enough to understand
this, and who has the LORD's command
to proclaim it? Why has the land becomeJeremiah 9.13–19
37
a dead land, scorched like the desert and
untrodden?
13 The LORD said: It is because they
rejected my law which I set before them;
they neither obeyed me nor followed it.
14 They followed the promptings of their
own stubborn hearts and followed the
baalim as their forefathers had taught
them.
15 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: I shall
give this people wormwood to eat and
bitter poison to drink.
16 I shall disperse them among nations
whom neither they nor their forefathers
have known; I shall harry them with the
sword until I have made an end of them.
17 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: Summon the wailing women
to come, send for the women skilled in
keening
18 to come quickly and raise a lament for
us, that our eyes may stream with tears
and our eyelids be wet with weeping.
19 The sound of lamenting is heard from
Zion: How fearful is our ruin! How great
our shame! We have left our land, our
houses have been overthrown.Jeremiah 9.20–26
38
20 Listen, you women, to the words of
the LORD, that your ears may catch
what he says. Teach your daughters
the lament; teach your neighbours this
dirge:
21 Death has climbed in through our
windows and entered our palaces,
cutting off the children in the street and
the young men in the thoroughfare.
22 Corpses will fall and lie like dung in
the fields, like swathes behind the reaper
with no one to gather them.
23 These are the words of the LORD: Let
not the wise boast of their wisdom, nor
the valiant of their valour; let not the
wealthy boast of their wealth;
24 but if anyone must boast, let him
boast of this: that he understands and
acknowledges me. For I am the LORD,
I show unfailing love, I do justice and
right on the earth; for in these I take
pleasure. This is the word of the LORD.
25 The time is coming, says the LORD,
when I shall punish all the circumcised,
26 Egypt and Judah and Edom, Ammon
and Moab, and all who live in the fringes
of the desert, for all alike, the nations
and Israel, are uncircumcised in heart.Jeremiah 10.1–7
39
1 Listen, Israel, to these words
10 that the LORD has spoken against
you:
2 Do not fall into the ways of the
nations, do not be terrified by signs in
the heavens. It is the nations who go in
terror of these.
3 For the carved images of the nations
are a sham; they are nothing but
timber cut from the forest, shaped by a
craftsman with his chisel
4 and decorated with silver and gold.
They are made fast with hammer and
nails to keep them from toppling over.
5 They are as dumb as a scarecrow in a
plot of cucumbers; they have always to
be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not
be afraid of them: they can do no harm,
nor have they any power to do good.
6 Where can one be found like you,
LORD? You are great, and great is the
might of your name.
7 Who would not fear you, King of the
nations, for fear is a fitting tribute for
you? Where among the wisest of the
nations and among all their royalty can
any be found like you?Jeremiah 10.8–14
40
8 One and all they are stupid and
foolish, learning their nonsense from a
piece of wood.
9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish
and gold from Ophir; they are the work
of craftsmen and goldsmiths; they are
draped in violet and purple, all made by
skilled workers.
10 But the LORD is God in truth, a living
God, an everlasting King. The earth
quakes under his fury; no nation can
endure his wrath.
11 You say this of them: The gods who
did not make heaven and earth will
perish from the earth and from under
these heavens.
12 God made the earth by his power,
fixed the world in place by his wisdom,
and by his knowledge unfurled the skies.
13 When he speaks in the thunder the
waters in the heavens are in tumult; he
brings up the mist from the ends of the
earth, he opens rifts for the rain, and
brings the wind out of his storehouses.
14 Everyone is brutish and ignorant;
every goldsmith is discredited through
his idols; for the figures he casts are a
sham, there is no breath in them.Jeremiah 10.15–22
41
15 They are worthless, objects of
mockery, which perish when their day of
reckoning comes.
16 Jacob's chosen God is not like these,
for he is the creator of the universe.
Israel is the people he claims as his own;
the LORD of Hosts is his name.
17 Gather up your goods and flee the
country, for you are living under siege.
18 These are the words of the LORD:
This time I shall throw out the whole
population of the land, and I shall press
them and squeeze them dry.
19 Oh, the pain of my wounds! The
injuries I suffer are cruel. I am laid low,
I said, and must endure it.
20 My tent is wrecked, my tent-ropes all
severed, my children have left me and
are gone, there is no one left to pitch my
tent again, no one to put up its curtains.
21 The shepherds of the people are
brutish; they never consult the LORD,
and so they do not act wisely, and their
entire flock is scattered.
22 Listen, a rumour comes flying, a
great uproar from the land of the north,
an army to make Judah's cities desolate,
a haunt of wolves.Jeremiah 10.23–11.4
42
23 I am aware, LORD, that no one's
ways are of his own choosing; nor is it
within his power to determine his course
in life.
24 Correct me, LORD, but with justice,
not in anger, or you will bring me almost
to nothing.
25 Pour out your fury on the nations that
have not acknowledged you, on tribes
that have not invoked you by name; for
they have devoured Jacob and made
an end of him and have left his home a
waste.
1 THE word which came to
Jeremiah from the LORD:
2 Listen to the terms of this covenant
and repeat them to the inhabitants of
Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem,
3 telling them: These are the words
of the LORD the God of Israel: A curse
on everyone who does not observe the
terms of this covenant
4 which I enjoined on your forefathers
when I brought them out of Egypt, from
the smelting furnace. I said: If you obey
me and do all that I command, you will
become my people and I shall become
your God.
11Jeremiah 11.5–10
43
5 I shall thus make good the oath I
swore to your forefathers, that I would
give them a land flowing with milk and
honey, the land you now possess. I
answered, Amen, LORD.
6 Then the LORD said: Proclaim these
terms throughout the towns of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem. Say:
Listen to the terms of this covenant and
carry them out.
7 I gave solemn warning to your
forefathers, from the time when I
brought them out of Egypt till this day; I
was at pains to warn them: Obey me, I
said.
8 But they did not obey; they paid no
attention to me, and each followed the
promptings of his own stubborn and
wicked heart. So I brought on them all
the penalties laid down in this covenant
which I had enjoined upon them, but
whose terms they did not observe.
9 The LORD said to me: The inhabitants
of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem
have entered into a conspiracy:
10 they have gone back to the sins of
their earliest forefathers and refused to
listen to me. They have followed otherJeremiah 11.11–15
44
gods and served them; Israel and Judah
have broken the covenant which I made
with their forefathers.
11 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD: I am about to bring on them a
disaster from which they cannot escape.
They may cry to me for help, but I shall
not listen.
12 The inhabitants of the towns of Judah
and of Jerusalem may go and cry for
help to the gods to whom they have
burnt sacrifices, but assuredly they will
not save them in the hour of disaster.
13 For you, Judah, have as many gods
as you have towns; you have set up as
many altars to burn sacrifices to Baal as
there are streets in Jerusalem.
14 So, Jeremiah, offer up no prayer for
this people; raise no plea or prayer on
their behalf, for I shall not listen when
they call to me in the hour of their
disaster.
15 What right has my beloved in my
house with her shameless ways? Can the
flesh of fat offerings on the altar ward
off the disaster that threatens you? Now
you will feel sharp anguish.Jeremiah 11.16–21
45
16 Once the LORD called you an olive
tree, leafy and fair; with a great roaring
noise he has set it on fire and its
branches are consumed.
17 The LORD of Hosts who planted
you has threatened you with disaster,
because of the evil which Israel and
Judah have done, provoking him to
anger by burning sacrifices to Baal.
18 It was the LORD who showed me,
and so I knew; he opened my eyes to
what they were doing.
19 I had been like a pet lamb led
trustingly to the slaughter; I did not
realize they were hatching plots against
me and saying, Let us destroy the tree
while the sap is in it; let us cut him off
from the land of the living, so that his
name will be wholly forgotten.
20 LORD of Hosts, most righteous judge,
testing the heart and mind, to you I have
committed my cause; let me see your
vengeance on them.
21 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD about the men of Anathoth who
seek to take your life, and say, Prophesy
no more in the name of the LORD or we
shall kill you --Jeremiah 11.22–12.5
46
22 these are his words: I am about to
punish them: their young men shall die
by the sword, their sons and daughters
by famine.
23 Not one of them will survive; for in
the year of reckoning for them I shall
bring disaster on the people of Anathoth.
1 LORD, even if I dispute with
you, you remain in the right; yet I
shall plead my case before you. Why do
the wicked prosper and the treacherous
all live at ease?
2 You have planted them and their roots
strike deep, they grow and bear fruit.
You are ever on their lips, yet far from
their hearts.
3 But you know me, LORD, you see me;
you test my devotion to you. Drag them
away like sheep to the shambles; set
them apart for the day of slaughter.
4 How long must the country lie parched
and all its green grass wither? No birds
and beasts are left, because its people
are so wicked, because they say, God
does not see what we are doing.
5 If you have raced with men running
on foot and they have worn you down,
how then can you hope to compete
12Jeremiah 12.6–12
47
with horses? If in easy country you fall
headlong, how will you fare in Jordan's
dense thickets?
6 Even your brothers and kinsmen deal
treacherously with you, they are in full
cry after you; do not trust them, for all
the fair words they use.
7 I have abandoned the house of Israel,
I have cast off my own people. I have
given my beloved into the power of her
foes.
8 My own people have turned on me like
lions from the jungle; they roar against
me, therefore I hate them.
9 Is this land of mine a hyena's lair,
with birds of prey hovering all around it?
Come, all you wild beasts; come, flock to
the feast.
10 Many shepherds have ravaged my
vineyard and trampled down my portion
of land, they have made my pleasant
portion a desolate wilderness;
11 they have made it a desolation, to
my sorrow. The whole land is desolate,
but no one pays heed.
12 Plunderers have swarmed across the
open regions of the wilderness; a sword
of the LORD devours the land from endJeremiah 12.13–13.1
48
to end; there is no peace for any living
thing.
13 Men sow wheat and reap thistles;
they sift but get no grain. Their harvest
is a disappointment to them because of
the fierce anger of the LORD.
14 These are the words of the LORD
about all those evil neighbours who
encroach on the land which I allotted to
my people Israel as their holding: I shall
uproot them from their own soil. Also I
shall uproot Judah from among them;
15 but after I have uprooted them, I
shall have pity on them again and bring
each man back to his holding and land.
16 If they will learn the ways of my
people, swearing by my name, by the life
of the LORD, as they taught my people
to swear by the Baal, they will establish
families among my people.
17 But the nation that will not listen,
I shall uproot and destroy. This is the
word of the LORD.
1 These were the words of the
LORD to me: Go and buy yourself
a linen loincloth and wrap it round your
body, but do not put it in water.
13Jeremiah 13.2–11
49
2 So I bought one as instructed by the
LORD and wrapped it round me.
3 The LORD spoke to me a second time:
4 Take the loincloth which you bought
and are wearing and go now to Perath,
where you are to hide it in a crevice in
the rocks.
5 I went and hid it at Perath, as the
LORD had ordered me.
6 A long time afterwards the LORD said
to me: Set out now for Perath and fetch
the loincloth which I told you to hide
there.
7 So I went to Perath and looked for the
place where I had hidden it, but when I
picked it up, I saw that it was ruined and
no good for anything.
8 The LORD spoke to me:
9 Thus shall I ruin the enormous pride
of Judah and Jerusalem.
10 This wicked people who refuse to
listen to my words, who follow the
promptings of their stubborn hearts and
go after other gods to serve and worship
them, will become like this loincloth, no
good for anything.
11 Just as a loincloth is bound close to a
man's body, so I bound all Israel and allJeremiah 13.12–16
50
Judah to myself, says the LORD, so that
they should become my people to be a
source of renown and praise and glory to
me; but they did not listen.
12 You are to say this to them: These
are the words of the LORD the God of
Israel: Wine jars should be filled with
wine. They will answer, We are well
aware that wine jars should be filled with
wine.
13 Then say to them, These are the
words of the LORD: I shall fill all the
inhabitants of this land with wine until
they are drunk -- kings of David's line
who sit on his throne, priests, prophets,
and all who live in Jerusalem.
14 I shall dash them one against the
other, fathers and sons together, says the
LORD; I shall show them no compassion
or pity or tenderness, nor refrain from
destroying them.
15 Pay heed; be not too proud to listen,
for it is the LORD who speaks.
16 Ascribe glory to the LORD your God
before the darkness falls, before your
feet stumble against the hillside in
the twilight, before he turns the lightJeremiah 13.17–22
51
you look for to deep gloom and thick
darkness.
17 If in those depths you will not listen,
then for very anguish I can only weep
bitterly; my eyes must stream with
tears, for the LORD's flock is carried off
into captivity.
18 Say to the king and the queen
mother: Take a humble seat, for your
proud crowns are fallen from your heads.
19 The towns in the Negeb are besieged,
and no one can relieve them; all Judah
has been swept into exile, swept clean
away.
20 Look up and see those who are
coming from the north. Where is the
flock that was entrusted to you, the
sheep that were your pride?
21 What will you say when your leaders
are missing, though trained by you to be
your head? Will not pangs seize you like
the pangs of a woman in labour,
22 when you wonder, Why has this
happened to me? For your many sins
your skirts are stripped off you, your
limbs uncovered.Jeremiah 13.23–14.3
52
23 Can a Nubian change his skin, or a
leopard its spots? No more can you do
good, you who are schooled in evil.
24 I shall scatter you like chaff before
the desert wind.
25 This is your lot, your portion as a
rebel, decreed by me, says the LORD,
because you have quite forgotten me
and trusted in false gods.
26 So I myself have torn off your skirts
and laid bare your shame:
27 your adulteries, your lustful neighing,
your wanton lewdness. On the hills and
the open fields I have seen your foul
deeds. Woe to you, Jerusalem, in your
uncleanness! How long will you delay?
1 This came to Jeremiah as the
word of the LORD concerning the
drought:
2 Judah droops, her towns languish,
the inhabitants sit on the ground in
mourning; and a crying goes up from
Jerusalem.
3 Masters send their servants for water,
but when they come to the pools they
find none there, and go back with
their vessels empty; disappointed and
shamed, they uncover their heads.
14Jeremiah 14.4–10
53
4 Because the ground is cracked through
lack of rain in the land, the farmers'
hopes are wrecked; they uncover their
heads in grief.
5 The hind calves in the open country,
and because there is no grass she
abandons her young.
6 Wild asses stand on the bare heights
and snuff the wind as wolves do, and
their eyes begin to fail for lack of
herbage.
7 Though our sins testify against us, yet
take action, LORD, for your own name's
sake. Our disloyalties indeed are many;
we have sinned against you.
8 Hope of Israel, their saviour in time
of trouble, must you be like a stranger
in the land, like a traveller breaking his
journey to find a night's lodging?
9 Must you be like a man suddenly
overcome, like a warrior powerless to
save himself? You are in our midst,
LORD, and we bear your name. Do not
forsake us.
10 The LORD says of this people: They
love to stray from my ways; they wander
where they will. Therefore the LORD
has no more pleasure in them; heJeremiah 14.11–15
54
remembers their guilt now, and punishes
their sins.
11 The LORD said to me: Do not pray for
the wellbeing of this people.
12 Though they fast, I shall not listen
to their cry; though they sacrifice
whole-offering and grain-offering, I shall
not accept them. I shall make an end of
them with sword, famine, and pestilence.
13 But I said: Ah, Lord GOD, the
prophets keep saying to them that they
will see no sword and suffer no famine;
for you will give them lasting prosperity
in this place.
14 The LORD answered me: These are
lies the prophets are prophesying in my
name. I have not sent them; I have
given them no charge; I have not spoken
to them. The prophets are offering false
visions, worthless augury, and their own
day-dreams.
15 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD about the prophets who, with no
commission from me, prophesy in my
name and say that neither sword nor
famine will touch this land: By sword
and by famine those prophets will meet
their end.Jeremiah 14.16–21
55
16 The people to whom they prophesy
will be flung out into the streets of
Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword:
they, their wives, their sons, and their
daughters, and there will be no one to
bury them. I shall pour down on them
the disaster they deserve.
17 This is what you are to say to
them: Let my eyes stream with tears
ceaselessly night and day. For the virgin
daughter of my people, struck by a cruel
blow, is grievously wounded.
18 If I go out into the open country, I
see those slain by the sword; if I enter
the city, I see the victims of famine.
Prophet and priest alike wander without
rest in the land.
19 Have you spurned Judah utterly? Do
you loathe Zion? Why have you wounded
us past all healing? We hoped to prosper,
but nothing went well. We hoped for
respite, but terror struck.
20 We acknowledge our wickedness, the
guilt of our forefathers; LORD, we have
sinned against you.
21 Do not despise the place where
your name dwells or bring contempt on
your glorious throne. Remember yourJeremiah 14.22–15.4
56
covenant with us and do not make it
void.
22 Can any of the false gods of the
nations give rain? Or do the heavens
of themselves send showers? Is it not
in you, LORD our God, that we put our
hope? You alone made all these things.
1 The LORD said to me: Even if
Moses and Samuel stood before
me, I would not be moved to pity this
people. Banish them from my presence;
let them be gone.
2 Should they ask where to go, say to
them: These are the words of the LORD:
Those who are for the plague shall go
to the plague, and those for the sword
to the sword; those who are for famine
to famine, and those for captivity to
captivity.
3 Four kinds of doom I ordain for them,
says the LORD: the sword to kill, dogs to
drag away, birds of prey and wild beasts
to devour and destroy.
4 I shall make them abhorrent to all
the kingdoms of the earth, because
of the crimes committed in Jerusalem
by Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of
Judah.
15Jeremiah 15.5–10
57
5 Who will take pity on you, Jerusalem,
who will offer you consolation? Who will
turn aside to ask about your wellbeing?
6 You yourselves cast me off, says the
LORD, you turned your backs on me, so
I stretched out my hand to bring you to
ruin; I was weary of relenting.
7 I winnowed them and scattered them
in every town in the land; I brought
bereavement on them, I destroyed my
people; they would not abandon their
ways.
8 I made widows among them more
in number than the sands of the seas;
I brought upon the mother of young
warriors a plunderer at noonday. I made
the terror of invasion fall upon her all in
a moment.
9 The mother of seven sons grew faint,
she sank into despair; her light was
quenched while it was yet day; she was
left humbled and shamed. The remnant
I shall give to the sword, to perish at the
hand of their enemies. This is the word
of the LORD.
10 ALAS, my mother, that ever you gave
birth to me, a man doomed to strife
with the whole world against me! I haveJeremiah 15.11–17
58
borrowed from no one, I have lent to no
one, yet everyone abuses me.
11 The LORD said: Have I not utterly
dismissed you? Shall I not bring the
enemy against you in a time of trouble
and distress?
12 Can iron break steel from the north?
13 I shall hand over your wealth as
spoil, and your treasure for no payment,
because of all your sin throughout your
borders.
14 I shall make you serve your enemies
in a land you do not know; for my anger
is a blazing fire and it will flare up against
you.
15 LORD, you know; remember me,
and vindicate me, avenge me on my
persecutors. Be patient with me and do
not put me off, see what reproaches I
endure for your sake.
16 When I came on your words I
devoured them; they were joy and
happiness to me, for you, LORD God of
Hosts, have named me yours.
17 I have never kept company with
revellers, never made merry with them;
because I felt your hand upon me I haveJeremiah 15.18–16.3
59
sat alone, for you have filled me with
indignation.
18 Why then is my pain unending, and
my wound desperate, past all healing?
You are to me like a brook that fails,
whose waters are not to be relied on.
19 This was the LORD's answer: If you
turn back to me, I shall take you back
and you will stand before me. If you can
separate the precious from the base,
you will be my spokesman. This people
may turn again to you, but you are not
to turn to them.
20 To withstand them I shall make you
strong, an unscaled wall of bronze.
Though they attack you, they will not
prevail, for I am with you to save and
deliver you, says the LORD;
21 I shall deliver you from the clutches
of the wicked, I shall rescue you from
the grasp of the ruthless.
1 THE word of the LORD came to
me:
2 You are not to marry or to have sons
and daughters in this place.
3 For these are the words of the LORD
about any sons and daughters born in
this place, about the mothers who bear
16Jeremiah 16.4–9
60
them and the fathers who beget them in
this land:
4 They shall die a horrible death; there
must be no wailing for them and no
burial; they will be dung spread over
the ground. They will perish by sword or
famine, and their corpses will be food for
birds and beasts.
5 For these are the words of the LORD:
Do not enter a house where there is a
funeral feast; do not go in to wail or to
bring comfort, for, says the LORD, I have
withdrawn my peace from this people,
my love and compassion.
6 High and low will die in this land, but
there must be no burial, no wailing for
them; no one is to gash himself or shave
his head.
7 No one is to offer the mourner a
portion of bread to console him for the
dead or give him a cup of consolation for
the loss of his father or mother.
8 Nor may you enter a house where
there is feasting, to sit eating and
drinking there.
9 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts, the God of Israel: In your own
days and in the sight of you all, I shallJeremiah 16.10–14
61
silence in this place every sound of joy
and gladness, the voices of bridegroom
and bride.
10 When you tell this people all these
things they will ask you, Why has the
LORD decreed that this great disaster
is to come on us? What wrong have
we done? What sin have we committed
against the LORD our God?
11 You are to answer: Because your
forefathers forsook me, says the LORD,
and followed other gods, serving and
worshipping them. They forsook me and
did not keep my law.
12 And you yourselves have done worse
than your forefathers; for each of you
follows the promptings of his wicked and
stubborn heart instead of obeying me.
13 So I shall fling you headlong out of
this land into a country unknown to you
and your forefathers; there serve other
gods day and night, for I shall show you
no favour.
14 Therefore the time is coming, says
the LORD, when people will no longer
swear by the life of the LORD who
brought the Israelites up from Egypt;Jeremiah 16.15–19
62
15 instead they will swear by the life
of the LORD who brought the Israelites
back from a northern land and from all
the lands to which he had dispersed
them; and I shall bring them back to the
soil which I gave to their forefathers.
16 I shall send for many fishermen, says
the LORD, and they will fish for them.
After that I shall send for many hunters,
and they will hunt them from every
mountain and hill and from the crevices
in the rocks.
17 For my eyes are on all their ways;
they are not hidden from my sight, nor
is their wrongdoing concealed from me.
18 I shall first make them pay double for
the wrong they have done and the sin
they have committed by defiling the land
which belongs to me; they have filled my
possession with their lifeless idols and
abominations.
19 LORD, my strength and my
stronghold, my refuge in time of trouble,
to you the nations will come from
the ends of the earth and say: Our
forefathers inherited only a sham, an
idol vain and worthless.Jeremiah 16.20–17.6
63
20 Can man make gods for himself?
They would be no gods.
21 Therefore I am teaching them, I shall
teach them once for all my power and
my might, and they will learn that my
name is the LORD.
1 The sin of Judah is recorded
with an iron stylus, engraved with
a diamond point on the tablet of their
hearts, on the horns of their altars
2 to witness against them. Their altars
and their sacred poles stand by every
spreading tree, on the heights
3 and the hills in the mountain country.
I shall hand over your wealth as spoil,
and all your treasure for no payment,
because of sin throughout your borders.
4 You will lose possession of the holding
which I gave you. I shall make you serve
your enemies in a land you do not know;
for the fire of my anger is kindled by you
and it will burn for ever.
5 These are the words of the LORD: A
curse on anyone who trusts in mortals
and leans for support on human kind,
while his heart is far from the LORD!
6 He will be like a juniper in the
steppeland; when good comes he
17Jeremiah 17.7–13
64
is unaware of it. He will live among
the rocks in the wilderness, in a salt,
uninhabited land.
7 Blessed is anyone who trusts in the
LORD, and rests his confidence on him.
8 He will be like a tree planted by the
waterside, that sends out its roots along
a stream. When the heat comes it has
nothing to fear; its foliage stays green.
Without care in a year of drought, it does
not fail to bear fruit.
9 The heart is deceitful above any other
thing, desperately sick; who can fathom
it?
10 I, the LORD, search the mind and
test the heart, requiting each one for his
conduct and as his deeds deserve.
11 Like a partridge sitting on a clutch of
eggs which it has not laid, so is he who
amasses wealth unjustly. Before his days
are half done it will leave him, and he
will be a fool at the last.
12 A glorious throne, exalted from the
beginning, is the site of our sanctuary;
13 LORD, on whom Israel's hope is fixed,
all who reject you will be put to shame;
those who forsake you will be inscribedJeremiah 17.14–20
65
in the dust, for they have rejected the
source of living water, the LORD.
14 Heal me, LORD, and I shall be healed,
save me and I shall be saved; for you
are my praise.
15 They say to me, Where is the word of
the LORD? Let it come, if it can!
16 It is not the prospect of disaster that
makes me press after you, and I did not
desire this day of despair. You know all
that has passed my lips; you are fully
aware of it.
17 Do not become a terror to me; you
are my refuge on an evil day.
18 May my persecutors be foiled, not I;
may they, not I, be terrified. Bring on
them an evil day; destroy them, destroy
them utterly.
19 These were the words of the LORD to
me: Go and stand at the Benjamin Gate,
through which the kings of Judah pass in
and out, and stand also at all the gates
of Jerusalem.
20 Say: Hear the words of the LORD,
you kings of Judah, all you people of
Judah, and all you citizens of Jerusalem
who come in through these gates.Jeremiah 17.21–26
66
21 These are the words of the LORD: Do
not put your lives at risk by carrying any
load on the sabbath day or bringing it
through the gates of Jerusalem.
22 You are not to bring any load out
of your houses or do any work on
the sabbath, but you are to keep the
sabbath day holy as I commanded your
forefathers.
23 They, however, did not obey or pay
attention, but stubbornly refused to hear
or receive instruction.
24 Now if you will obey me, says the
LORD, and refrain from bringing any
load through the gates of this city on
the sabbath, and keep that day holy by
doing no work on it,
25 then kings will come through the
gates of this city, kings who will sit on
David's throne. They will come riding in
chariots or on horseback, escorted by
their officers, by the people of Judah,
and by the citizens of Jerusalem; and
this city will be inhabited for ever.
26 People will come from the towns of
Judah, the country round Jerusalem, the
territory of Benjamin, the Shephelah,
the hill-country, and the Negeb, bringingJeremiah 17.27–18.6
67
whole-offerings, sacrifices, grain-
offerings, and frankincense, bringing
also thank-offerings to the house of the
LORD.
27 But if you do not obey me by keeping
the sabbath day holy and by carrying no
load as you come through the gates of
Jerusalem on the sabbath, then I shall
set fire to the gates; it will consume the
palaces of Jerusalem and will not be put
out.
1 THESE are the words which
came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
2 Go down now to the potter's house,
and there I shall tell you what I have to
say.
3 I went down to the potter's house,
where I found him working at the wheel.
4 Now and then a vessel he was making
from the clay would be spoilt in his
hands, and he would remould it into
another vessel to his liking.
5 Then the word of the LORD came to
me:
6 Israel, can I not deal with you as
this potter deals with his clay? says the
LORD. House of Israel, you are clay in
my hands like the clay in his.
18Jeremiah 18.7–13
68
7 At any moment I may threaten to
uproot a nation or a kingdom, to pull it
down and destroy it.
8 But if the nation which I have
threatened turns back from its wicked
ways, then I shall think again about the
disaster I had in mind for it.
9 At another moment I may announce
that I shall build or plant a nation or a
kingdom.
10 But if it does evil in my sight by
disobeying me, I shall think again about
the good I had in mind for it.
11 Go now and tell the people of Judah
and the citizens of Jerusalem that these
are the words of the LORD: I am framing
disaster for you and perfecting my
designs against you. Turn back, every
one of you, from his evil conduct; mend
your ways and your actions.
12 But they will answer, Things are past
hope. We must stick to our own plans,
and each of us follow the promptings of
his wicked and stubborn heart.
13 Therefore these are the words of
the LORD: Enquire among the nations:
whoever heard the like of this? The virgin
Israel has done a thing most horrible.Jeremiah 18.14–20
69
14 Does the snow cease to fall from the
rocky slopes of Lebanon? Does the cool
rain streaming in torrents ever fail?
15 No, but my people have forgotten
me: they burn sacrifices to idols which
cause them to stumble as they tread the
ancient ways, and they take to byways
and unmade roads;
16 their own land they lay waste, an
object of lasting derision, at which all
passers-by shake their heads in horror.
17 As with a wind from the east I shall
scatter them before their enemies. In
the hour of their downfall I shall turn my
back and not my face towards them.
18 The cry was raised: Let us consider
how to deal with Jeremiah. There will
still be priests to guide us, still wise
men to give counsel, still prophets to
proclaim the word. Let us invent some
charges against him; let us pay no heed
to anything he says.
19 But pay heed, LORD, and hear what
my opponents are saying against me.
20 Is good to be repaid with evil, that
they have dug a pit for me? Remember
how I stood before you, interceding onJeremiah 18.21–19.2
70
their behalf to avert your wrath from
them.
21 Therefore give their children over
to famine, leave them at the mercy of
the sword. Let their women be childless
and widowed, let their men be slain by
pestilence, their young men cut down in
battle.
22 Bring raiders on them without
warning, and let screaming be heard
from their houses. They have dug a pit
to catch me and have laid snares for my
feet.
23 Well you know, LORD, all their
murderous plots against me. Do not
blot out their wrongdoing or wipe away
their sin from your sight; when they are
brought stumbling before you, deal with
them on the day of your anger.
1 These are the words of the
LORD: Go and buy from the potter
an earthenware jar, and taking with you
some of the elders of the people and
some priests,
2 go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom, on
which the Gate of the Potsherds opens,
and there proclaim what I tell you.
19Jeremiah 19.3–7
71
3 Say: Hear the word of the LORD,
you princes of Judah and citizens of
Jerusalem. These are the words of the
LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: I am
about to bring on this place such a
disaster as will ring in the ears of all who
hear of it,
4 because they have forsaken me, and
made this a place of alien worship. They
have burnt sacrifices to other gods whom
neither they nor their forefathers nor
the kings of Judah ever knew, and they
have filled this place with the blood of
the innocent.
5 They have built shrines to Baal, at
which to burn their sons as whole-
offerings to Baal. That was no command
of mine, a thing I never spoke of, nor did
it ever enter my mind.
6 Therefore the time is coming, says the
LORD, when it will no longer be called
Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but
the valley of Slaughter.
7 In this place I shall make void the
plans of Judah and Jerusalem; I shall
make the people fall by the sword
before their enemies, at the hands of
those who seek to kill them; I shall giveJeremiah 19.8–13
72
their corpses to the birds and beasts to
devour.
8 I shall make this city a scene of
desolation, an object of astonishment,
so that every passer-by will be desolated
and appalled at the sight of all her
wounds.
9 I shall make people eat the flesh of
their sons and their daughters; they will
devour one another's flesh in the dire
straits to which their enemies and those
who would kill them will reduce them in
the siege.
10 Then you are to smash the jar before
the eyes of the men who accompany you
11 and say to them: These are the words
of the LORD of Hosts: Thus shall I smash
this people and this city as an earthen
vessel is smashed beyond all repair, and
the dead will be buried in Topheth until
there is no room left to bury them.
12 That is how I shall deal with this place
and with those who live there, says the
LORD: I shall make this city like Topheth.
13 Because of their defilement, the
houses of Jerusalem and those of the
kings of Judah will be like the site of
Topheth, every one of the houses onJeremiah 19.14–20.4
73
whose roofs men have burnt sacrifices
to all the host of heaven and poured
drink-offerings to other gods.
14 When Jeremiah came in from
Topheth, where the LORD had sent him
to prophesy, he stood in the court of the
LORD's house and said to all the people:
15 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: I am about to
bring on this city and on all its dependent
towns the whole disaster with which I
have threatened it, for its people have
remained stubborn and refused to listen
to me.
1 The priest Pashhur son of Immer,
the chief officer in the house of
the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying
these things,
2 and had him flogged and put him in
the stocks at the Upper Benjamin Gate,
in the house of the LORD.
3 When next morning Pashhur released
him from the stocks, Jeremiah said
to him: The LORD has called you not
Pashhur but Magor-missabib.
4 For these are the words of the LORD:
I shall make you a terror to yourself and
to all your friends; they will fall by the
20Jeremiah 20.5–9
74
sword of the enemy before your very
eyes. I shall hand over all Judah to the
king of Babylon, and he will deport them
to Babylon or put them to the sword.
5 I shall give all this city's store of
wealth and riches and all the treasures
of the kings of Judah to their enemies;
they will seize them as spoil and carry
them off to Babylon.
6 You, Pashhur, and all your household
will go into captivity. You will come to
Babylon; there you will die and there you
will be buried, you and all your friends to
whom you have been a false prophet.
7 YOU HAVE duped me, LORD, and
I have been your dupe; you have
outwitted me and prevailed. All the day
long I have been made a laughing-stock;
everyone ridicules me.
8 Whenever I speak I must needs cry
out, calling, Violence! and Assault! I am
reproached and derided all the time for
uttering the word of the LORD.
9 Whenever I said, I shall not call it to
mind or speak in his name again, then
his word became imprisoned within me
like a fire burning in my heart. I wasJeremiah 20.10–15
75
weary with holding it under, and could
endure no more.
10 For I heard many whispering,
Terror let loose! Denounce him! Let
us denounce him. All my friends were
on the watch for a false step, saying,
Perhaps he may be tricked; then we can
catch him and have our revenge on him.
11 But the LORD is on my side, a
powerful champion; therefore my
persecutors will stumble and fall
powerless. Their abasement will be bitter
when they fail, and their dishonour will
long be remembered.
12 But, LORD of Hosts, you test the
righteous and search the depths of the
heart. To you I have committed my
cause; let me see your vengeance on
them.
13 Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD;
for he rescues the poor from those who
would do them wrong.
14 A curse on the day when I was born!
The day my mother bore me, may it be
for ever unblessed!
15 A curse on the man who brought
word to my father, A child is born to you,
a son, and gladdened his heart!Jeremiah 20.16–21.4
76
16 May that man fare like the cities
which the LORD overthrew without
mercy. May he hear cries of alarm in the
morning and uproar at noon,
17 since death did not claim me before
birth, and my mother did not become my
grave, her womb great with me for ever.
18 Why did I come from the womb to
see only sorrow and toil, to end my days
in shame?
1 THE word which came from the
LORD to Jeremiah when King
Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of
Malchiah and the priest Zephaniah son
of Maaseiah with this request:
2 King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon has
declared war on us; enquire of the LORD
on our behalf. Perhaps the LORD will
perform a miracle as he has done in
times past, so that Nebuchadrezzar will
raise the siege.
3 But Jeremiah answered them: Tell
Zedekiah
4 that these are the words of the LORD
the God of Israel: I shall turn against
you your own weapons with which you
are fighting the king of Babylon and
the Chaldaeans who are besieging you
21Jeremiah 21.5–10
77
outside the wall; and I shall bring them
into the heart of this city.
5 I myself shall fight against you in
burning rage and great fury, with an
outstretched hand and a strong arm.
6 I shall strike down those who live in
this city, men and cattle alike; they will
die of a great pestilence.
7 After that, says the LORD, I shall
take King Zedekiah of Judah, his
courtiers, and the people, all in this
city who survive pestilence, sword, and
famine, and hand them over to King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, to their
enemies and those who would kill them.
He will put them to the sword and show
no pity or mercy or compassion.
8 You are to say further to this people:
These are the words of the LORD: I offer
you now a choice between the way of life
and the way of death.
9 Whoever remains in this city will die
by sword, famine, or pestilence, but
whoever goes out and surrenders to the
Chaldaeans now laying siege to you will
survive; he will escape with his life.
10 I have set my face against this city,
determined to do them harm, not good,Jeremiah 21.11–22.2
78
says the LORD. It will be handed over to
the king of Babylon, and he will burn it
to the ground.
11 To the royal house of Judah: Listen to
the word of the LORD;
12 house of David, these are the words
of the LORD: Dispense justice betimes,
rescue the victim from his oppressor, or
the fire of my fury may blaze up and
burn unquenchably because of your evil
actions.
13 The LORD says: I am against you,
you inhabitants of the valley, the rock
in the plain, who say, Who can come
down upon us? Who can penetrate our
retreats?
14 I shall punish you as your deeds
deserve, says the LORD, I shall set fire
to your heathland, and it will devour
everything round about.
1 These are the words of the
LORD: Go down to the palace of
the king of Judah with this message:
2 King of Judah, occupant of David's
throne, listen to the words of the LORD,
you and your courtiers and your people
who come in at these gates.
22Jeremiah 22.3–8
79
3 These are the words of the LORD:
Deal justly and fairly, rescue the victim
from his oppressor, do not ill-treat or
use violence towards the alien, the
fatherless, and the widow, and do not
shed innocent blood in this place.
4 If you obey, then kings who succeed to
David's throne will come riding through
the gates of this palace in chariots and
on horses, with their retinue of courtiers
and subjects.
5 But if you do not obey my words, then
by myself I solemnly swear, says the
LORD, this palace will become a ruin.
6 For these are the words of the LORD
about the royal house of Judah: Though
you are dear to me as Gilead or as the
crest of Lebanon, I swear that I shall
turn you into a wilderness, a land of
towns no longer inhabited.
7 I shall consecrate an armed host to
fight against you, a destructive horde;
they will cut down your choicest cedars,
felling them for fuel.
8 People of many nations will pass by
this city and say to one another, Why
has the LORD done such a thing to this
great city?Jeremiah 22.9–15
80
9 The answer will be, Because they
forsook their covenant with the LORD
their God by worshipping other gods and
serving them.
10 Weep not for him who is dead nor
lament his loss. Weep rather for him who
is going into exile, for he will return no
more, never again see the land of his
birth.
11 For these are the words of the LORD
concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king
of Judah, who succeeded his father on
the throne and has gone from this place:
He will never return;
12 he will die in the place of his exile
without ever seeing this land again.
13 Woe betide him who builds his palace
on unfairness and completes its roof-
chambers with injustice, compelling his
countrymen to work without payment,
giving them no wage for their labour!
14 Woe to him who says, I shall build
myself a spacious palace with airy
roof-chambers and windows set in it; it
will be panelled with cedar and painted
with vermilion.
15 Though your cedar is so splendid,
does that prove you a king? Think ofJeremiah 22.16–21
81
your father: he ate and drank, dealt
justly and fairly; all went well with him.
16 He upheld the cause of the lowly and
poor; then all was well. Did not this show
he knew me? says the LORD.
17 But your eyes and your heart are
set on naught but gain, set only on the
innocent blood you can shed, on the
cruel acts of tyranny you perpetrate.
18 Therefore these are the words of
the LORD concerning Jehoiakim son
of Josiah, king of Judah: For him no
mourner will say, Alas, brother, dear
brother! no one say, Alas, lord and
master!
19 He will be buried like a dead donkey,
dragged along and flung out beyond the
gates of Jerusalem.
20 Go up to Lebanon and cry aloud,
make your voice heard in Bashan, cry
aloud from Abarim, for all who love you
are broken.
21 I spoke to you in your days of
prosperous ease, but you said, I shall not
listen. Since your youth this is how you
have behaved; you have never obeyed
me.Jeremiah 22.22–28
82
22 A wind will carry away all your
friends; those who love you will go into
captivity. Then you will be abashed and
put to shame for all your evil deeds.
23 You dwellers in Lebanon, nestling
among the cedars, how you will groan
when pains come on you, like the pangs
of a woman in labour!
24 By my life, says the LORD, although
you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of
Judah, are the signet ring on my right
hand, I shall pull you off
25 and hand you over to those who
seek your life, to those you fear, to King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and to the
Chaldaeans.
26 I shall fling you headlong, you and
the mother who bore you, into another
land, not that of your birth, and there
you will both die.
27 You will never come back to your own
land, the land for which you long.
28 This man Coniah, then, is he a mere
puppet, despised and broken, a thing
unwanted? Why else are he and his
children flung out headlong and hurled
into a country they do not know?Jeremiah 22.29–23.4
83
29 Land, land, land! Hear the words of
the LORD:
30 These are the words of the LORD:
Write this man down as stripped of all
honour, one who in his lifetime will not
prosper, nor leave descendants to sit
in prosperity on David's throne or rule
again over Judah.
1 Woe betide the shepherds who
let the sheep of my flock scatter
and be lost! says the LORD.
2 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD the God of Israel to the shepherds
who tend my people: You have scattered
and dispersed my flock. You have not
watched over them; but I am watching
you to punish you for your misdeeds,
says the LORD.
3 I myself shall gather the remnant of
my sheep from all the lands to which I
have dispersed them. I shall bring them
back to their homes, and they will be
fruitful and increase.
4 I shall appoint shepherds who will
tend them, so that never again will they
know fear or dismay or punishment. This
is the word of the LORD.
23Jeremiah 23.5–10
84
5 The days are coming, says the LORD,
when I shall make a righteous Branch
spring from David's line, a king who will
rule wisely, maintaining justice and right
in the land.
6 In his days Judah will be kept safe,
and Israel will live undisturbed. This will
be the name to be given to him: The
LORD our Righteousness.
7 Therefore the time is coming, says the
LORD, when people will no longer swear
by the life of the LORD who brought the
Israelites up from Egypt;
8 instead they will swear by the life of
the LORD who brought the descendants
of the Israelites back from a northern
land and from all the lands to which he
had dispersed them; and they will live
on their own soil.
9 Of the prophets: Within my breast my
heart gives way, there is no strength in
my bones; because of the LORD, because
of his holy words, I have become like
a drunken man, like one overcome by
wine.
10 For the land is full of adulterers, and
because of them the earth lies parched,
the open pastures have dried up. TheJeremiah 23.11–15
85
lives they lead are wicked, and the
powers they possess are misused.
11 For prophet and priest alike are
godless; even in my house I have
witnessed their evil deeds. This is the
word of the LORD.
12 Therefore their path will turn slippery
beneath their feet; they will be dispersed
in the dark and fall headlong, for I shall
bring disaster on them, their day of
reckoning. This is the word of the LORD.
13 Among the prophets of Samaria I
found a lack of sense: they prophesied
in Baal's name and led my people Israel
astray.
14 Among the prophets of Jerusalem I
see a thing most horrible: adulterers and
hypocrites. They encourage evildoers,
so that no one turns back from sin; to
me all her inhabitants are like those of
Sodom and Gomorrah.
15 These then are the words of the LORD
of Hosts about the prophets: I shall
give them wormwood to eat and bitter
poison to drink; for from the prophets of
Jerusalem a godless spirit has spread to
the whole country.Jeremiah 23.16–22
86
16 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: Do not listen to what is
prophesied to you by the prophets, who
buoy you up with false hopes; they give
voice to their own fancies; it is not the
LORD's words they speak.
17 They say to those who spurn the word
of the LORD, Prosperity will be yours;
and to all who follow their stubborn
hearts they say, No harm will befall you.
18 For which of them has stood in the
council of the LORD, has been aware of
his word and listened to it? Which of
them has heeded his word and obeyed?
19 See what a scorching wind has gone
out from the LORD, a furious whirlwind
which whirls round the heads of the
wicked.
20 The LORD's anger is not to be turned
aside, until he has fully accomplished his
purposes. In days to come you will truly
understand.
21 I did not send these prophets, yet
they went in haste; I did not speak to
them, yet they prophesied.
22 But if they had stood in my council,
they would have proclaimed my wordsJeremiah 23.23–29
87
to my people and turned them from their
evil ways and their evil doings.
23 Am I a God near at hand only, not a
God when far away?
24 Can anyone hide in some secret place
and I not see him? Do I not fill heaven
and earth? This is the word of the LORD.
25 I have heard what the prophets say,
the prophets who speak lies in my name;
they cry, I have had a dream, I have had
a dream!
26 How much longer will these prophets
be minded to prophesy lies and give
voice to their own inventions?
27 By these dreams which they tell one
another they think they will make my
people forget my name, just as their
fathers forgot my name for the name of
Baal.
28 If a prophet has a dream, let him tell
his dream; if he has my word, let him
speak my word faithfully. Chaff and grain
are quite distinct, says the LORD.
29 Are not my words like fire, says the
LORD; are they not like a hammer that
shatters rock?Jeremiah 23.30–36
88
30 Therefore I am against those
prophets, the impostors who steal my
words from the others, says the LORD.
31 I am against those prophets, says
the LORD, who concoct words of their
own and then say, This is his word.
32 I am against those prophets, says
the LORD, who deal in false dreams and
relate them to mislead my people with
wild and reckless falsehoods. It was not
I who sent them or commissioned them,
and they will do this people no good
service. This is the word of the LORD.
33 When you are asked by this people
or by a prophet or a priest what is the
burden of the LORD, you shall answer:
You are the burden, and I shall throw
you down, says the LORD.
34 If anyone, prophet, priest, or layman,
mentions the LORD's burden, I shall
punish that person and his family.
35 The form of words you shall use in
speaking amongst yourselves is: What
answer has the LORD given? or, What
has the LORD said?
36 You must never again mention the
burden of the LORD; for how can his
word be a burden to anyone? But youJeremiah 23.37–24.1
89
pervert the words of the living God, the
LORD of Hosts our God.
37 This is the form you are to use in
speaking to a prophet: What answer has
the LORD given? or, What has the LORD
said?
38 But to any of you who do say the
burden of the LORD, the LORD speaks
thus: Because you say the burden of the
LORD, though I sent to tell you not to
say it,
39 therefore I myself shall carry you like
a burden and throw you away out of my
sight, both you and the city which I gave
to you and to your forefathers.
40 I shall inflict on you endless reproach,
endless shame which will never be
forgotten.
1 THIS is what the LORD showed
me: I saw two baskets of figs set
out in front of the temple of the LORD.
This was after King Nebuchadrezzar of
Babylon had deported from Jerusalem
Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah,
with the officers of Judah, the craftsmen,
and the smiths, and taken them to
Babylon.
24Jeremiah 24.2–8
90
2 In one basket the figs were very good,
like those that are first ripe; in the other
the figs were very bad, so bad that they
were not fit to eat.
3 The LORD said to me, What are you
looking at, Jeremiah? Figs, I answered,
the good very good, and the bad so bad
that they are not fit to eat.
4 Then this word came to me from the
LORD:
5 These are the words of the LORD the
God of Israel: I count the exiles of Judah
whom I sent away from this place to the
land of the Chaldaeans as good as these
good figs.
6 I shall look to their welfare, and
restore them to this land; I shall build
them up and not pull them down, plant
them and not uproot them.
7 I shall give them the wit to know me,
for I am the LORD; they will be my
people and I shall be their God, for they
will come back to me wholeheartedly.
8 But King Zedekiah of Judah, his
officers, and the survivors of Jerusalem,
both those who remain in this land and
those who have settled in Egypt -- allJeremiah 24.9–25.4
91
these I shall treat as bad figs, says the
LORD, so bad that they are not fit to eat.
9 I shall make them abhorrent to all
the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach,
a byword, an object of taunting and
cursing wherever I banish them.
10 I shall send sword, famine, and
pestilence against them until they have
vanished from the land which I gave to
them and to their forefathers.
1 This came to Jeremiah as the
word concerning all the people of
Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was
the first year of King Nebuchadrezzar of
Babylon.
2 This is what the prophet Jeremiah said
to all Judah and all the inhabitants of
Jerusalem:
3 For twenty-three years, from the
thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon,
king of Judah, up to the present day, I
have been receiving the words of the
LORD and speaking to you again and
again, but you would not listen.
4 Again and again the LORD has sent
you all his servants the prophets, but you
25Jeremiah 25.5–9
92
would not listen or show any inclination
to listen.
5 He promised that if each of you would
turn from his wicked ways and evil
conduct, then you would live for ever on
the soil which the LORD gave to you and
to your forefathers.
6 You must not follow other gods,
serving and worshipping them, nor must
you provoke me to anger with the idols
your hands have made; then I shall not
harm you.
7 But you would not listen to me, says
the LORD; you provoked me to anger
with the idols your hands had made and
so brought harm upon yourselves.
8 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD of Hosts: Because you have not
listened to my words,
9 I shall summon all the tribes of the
north, says the LORD, and I shall send
for my servant King Nebuchadrezzar
of Babylon. I shall bring them against
this land and all its inhabitants and
against all these nations round it; I
shall exterminate them and make them
an object of horror and astonishment,
ruined for ever.Jeremiah 25.10–15
93
10 I shall silence every sound of joy
and gladness among them, the voices of
bridegroom and bride, and the sound of
the handmill; the light of every lamp will
be quenched.
11 For seventy years this whole country
will be a ruin, an object of horror, and
these nations will be in subjection to the
king of Babylon.
12 When the seventy years are up, I
shall punish the king of Babylon and
his people, says the LORD, for all their
misdeeds, and make the land of the
Chaldaeans a waste for ever.
13 I shall bring on that country all I
have pronounced against it, all that is
written in this scroll, all that Jeremiah
has prophesied against all the nations.
14 Mighty nations and great kings will
reduce them to servitude, and thus I
shall requite them for their actions and
their deeds.
15 These were the words of the LORD
the God of Israel to me: Receive from
my hand this cup of the wine of wrath,
and make all the nations to whom I send
you drink from it.Jeremiah 25.16–25
94
16 When they have drunk they will vomit
and become crazed; such is the sword
which I am sending among them.
17 I took the cup from the LORD's hand
and made all the nations to whom he
sent me drink it:
18 Jerusalem and the towns of Judah,
its kings and officers, turning them into
a ruin, an object of horror, derision, and
cursing, as they still are;
19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his courtiers,
his officers, all his people,
20 and all his mixed crowd of followers,
all the kings of the land of Uz, all the
kings of the Philistines, of Ashkelon,
Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of
Ashdod;
21 also Edom, Moab, and the
Ammonites,
22 all the kings of Tyre, of Sidon, and of
the overseas coastlands;
23 also Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who
live in the fringes of the desert,
24 all the kings of Arabia living in the
desert,
25 all the kings of Zimri, of Elam, and of
the Medes,Jeremiah 25.26–30
95
26 all the kings of the north, neighbours
or distant from each other -- all the
kingdoms on the face of the earth. Last
of all the king of Sheshak will have to
drink.
27 Say to them: These are the words
of the LORD of Hosts the God of Israel:
Drink this, get drunk, and be sick; fall
down, never to rise again, because of
the sword I am sending among you.
28 If they refuse to accept the cup from
you and to drink, say to them: These are
the words of the LORD of Hosts: Most
certainly you are to drink.
29 I shall first punish the city which
bears my name; do you think that you
can be exempt? No, you will not be
exempt, for I am summoning a sword
against all the inhabitants of the earth.
This is the word of the LORD of Hosts.
30 Prophesy to them and tell them all I
have said: The LORD roars from on high,
he thunders from his holy dwelling-place.
He roars loudly against his land; like
those who tread the grapes he utters a
shout against all the inhabitants of the
land.Jeremiah 25.31–37
96
31 The great noise reaches to the ends
of the earth, for the LORD brings a
charge against the nations; he arraigns
all mankind and has handed the wicked
over to the sword. This is the word of the
LORD.
32 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: Ruin spreads from nation to
nation, a mighty tempest is blowing up
from the far corners of the earth.
33 Those whom the LORD has slain on
that day will lie scattered from one end
of the earth to the other; they will not be
mourned or taken up for burial; they will
be dung spread over the ground.
34 Wail, you shepherds, cry aloud,
sprinkle yourselves with ashes, you
masters of the flock. It is your time to
go to the slaughter, and you will fall like
fine rams.
35 The shepherds will have nowhere to
flee, the flockmasters no way of escape.
36 The shepherds cry out, the
flockmasters wail, for the LORD is
ravaging their pasture,
37 and their peaceful homesteads lie in
ruins beneath the LORD's fierce anger.Jeremiah 25.38–26.5
97
38 They flee like a young lion abandoning
his lair, for the land has become a waste
under the sword of the oppressor and
the fierce anger of the LORD.
1 AT the beginning of the reign of
Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of
Judah, this word came from the LORD:
2 These are the words of the LORD:
Stand in the court of the LORD's house
and speak to the inhabitants of all the
towns of Judah who come to worship
there. Tell them everything that I charge
you to say to them; do not cut it short
by one word.
3 Perhaps they may listen, and everyone
may turn back from evil ways. If they
do, I shall relent, and give up my plan
to bring disaster on them for their evil
deeds.
4 Say to them: These are the words of
the LORD: If you do not obey me, if you
do not live according to the law I have
set before you,
5 and listen to the words of my servants
the prophets, whom again and again I
have been sending to you, though you
have never listened to them,
26Jeremiah 26.6–12
98
6 then I shall do to this house as I did
to Shiloh, and make this city an object of
cursing to all nations on earth.
7 The priests, the prophets, and all the
people heard Jeremiah say this in the
LORD's house
8 and, when he came to the end of what
the LORD had charged him to say to
them, the priests and prophets and all
the people seized him and threatened
him with death.
9 Why, they demanded, do you prophesy
in the LORD's name that this house
will become like Shiloh and this city an
uninhabited ruin? The people all crowded
round Jeremiah in the LORD's house.
10 When the chief officers of Judah
heard what was happening, they went
up from the royal palace to the LORD's
house and took their places there at the
entrance of the New Gate.
11 The priests and the prophets said to
the officers and all the people, This man
deserves to be condemned to death,
because he has prophesied against this
city, as you yourselves have heard.
12 Then Jeremiah said to all the officers
and people, The LORD it was who sentJeremiah 26.13–18
99
me to prophesy against this house and
this city all the things you have heard.
13 Now, if you mend your ways and your
actions and obey the LORD your God,
he may relent and revoke the disaster
which he has pronounced against you.
14 But here I am in your hands; do with
me whatever you think right and proper.
15 Only you may be certain that, if you
put me to death, you and this city and
those who live in it will be guilty of
murdering an innocent man; for truly it
was the LORD who sent me to you to say
all this to you.
16 The officers and all the people then
said to the priests and the prophets,
This man ought not to be condemned
to death, for he has spoken to us in the
name of the LORD our God.
17 Some of the elders of the land
also stood up and said to the whole
assembled people,
18 In the time of King Hezekiah of Judah,
Micah of Moresheth was prophesying and
said to all the people of Judah: These are
the words of the LORD of Hosts: Zion will
become a ploughed field, Jerusalem aJeremiah 26.19–24
100
heap of ruins, and the temple hill rough
heath.
19 Did King Hezekiah and all Judah put
him to death? Did not the king show
reverence for the LORD and seek to
placate him, so that the LORD relented
and revoked the disaster which he had
pronounced on them? But we are on
the point of inflicting great disaster on
ourselves.
20 There was another man too who
prophesied in the name of the LORD:
Uriah son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-
jearim. He prophesied against this city
and this land, just as Jeremiah had done.
21 King Jehoiakim with his bodyguard
and all his officers heard what he said
and sought to put him to death. On
hearing of this, Uriah fled in fear to
Egypt.
22 King Jehoiakim dispatched Elnathan
son of Akbor with some others
23 to fetch Uriah from Egypt. When they
brought him to the king, he had him put
to the sword and his body flung into the
burial-place of the common people.
24 But Ahikam son of Shaphan used
his influence on Jeremiah's behalf toJeremiah 27.1–7
101
save him from death at the hands of the
people.
1 AT the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of
Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from
the LORD:
2 These are the words of the LORD to
me: Take the cords and crossbars of a
yoke and put them on your neck.
3 Then send to the kings of Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon by their
envoys who have come to King Zedekiah
of Judah in Jerusalem,
4 and give them the following message
for their masters: These are the words
of the LORD of Hosts the God of Israel:
Say to your masters:
5 It was I who by my great power and
outstretched arm made the earth, along
with mankind and the animals all over
the earth, and I give it to whom I see fit.
6 Now I have handed over all these lands
to my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of
Babylon, and I have given him even the
creatures of the wild to serve him.
7 All nations will serve him, his son, and
his grandson, until the destined hour of
27Jeremiah 27.8–12
102
his own land comes; mighty nations and
great kings will be subject to him.
8 If any nation or kingdom will not serve
King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon or
submit to his yoke, I shall punish them
with sword, famine, and pestilence, says
the LORD, until I have ensured their
destruction at his hand.
9 Therefore do not listen to your
prophets, your diviners, your women
dreamers, your soothsayers, and your
sorcerers who keep on saying to you
that you will not become subject to the
king of Babylon.
10 Their prophecy to you is a lie; you
will be carried away far from your native
soil, and I shall banish you and you will
perish.
11 But the nation which submits to the
yoke of the king of Babylon and serves
him I shall leave on their own soil, says
the LORD; they will cultivate it and live
there.
12 My message to King Zedekiah of
Judah is no different: If you will submit
to the yoke of the king of Babylon and
serve him and his people, then you will
save your lives.Jeremiah 27.13–18
103
13 Why should you and your people die
by sword, famine, and pestilence, the
fate with which the LORD has threatened
any nation which does not serve the king
of Babylon?
14 Do not listen to the prophets who say
to you that you will not become subject
to the king of Babylon. Their prophecy to
you is a lie.
15 I have not sent them, says the
LORD; they are prophesying falsely in
my name; I shall banish you and you
will perish, you and the prophets who
prophesy to you.
16 I said to the priests and all this
people: These are the words of the
LORD: Do not listen to your prophets
who tell you that very shortly the vessels
of the LORD's house will be brought back
from Babylon. Their prophecy to you is a
lie.
17 Do not listen to them; serve the king
of Babylon, and save your lives. Why
should this city become a ruin?
18 If they are really prophets and have
the word of the LORD, let them intercede
with the LORD of Hosts to grant that the
things still left in the LORD's house, inJeremiah 27.19–28.1
104
the royal palace, and in Jerusalem, may
not be carried off to Babylon.
19 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts about the pillars, the Sea, the
trolleys, and all the other furnishings still
left in this city,
20 which King Nebuchadnezzar of
Babylon did not take when he deported
Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of
Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon,
together with all the nobles of Judah and
Jerusalem.
21 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel about everything
still left in the LORD's house, in the royal
palace, and in Jerusalem:
22 They will be carried off to Babylon
and remain there until I recall them,
says the LORD; then I shall bring them
back and restore them to this place.
1 That same year, at the beginning
of the reign of King Zedekiah of
Judah in the fifth month of the first year,
Hananiah son of Azzur, the prophet from
Gibeon, said to Jeremiah in the house of
the LORD before the priests and all the
people,
28Jeremiah 28.2–8
105
2 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: I shall break the
yoke of the king of Babylon.
3 Within two years I shall restore
to this place everything which King
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from
the LORD's house and carried off to
Babylon.
4 I shall also bring back to this
place, says the LORD, Jeconiah son of
Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the
Judaean exiles who went to Babylon;
for I shall break the yoke of the king of
Babylon.
5 The prophet Jeremiah gave this reply
to Hananiah the prophet in the presence
of the priests and all the people standing
there in the LORD's house:
6 May it be so! May the LORD indeed
do this: may he fulfil all that you
have prophesied, by bringing back the
furnishings of the LORD's house together
with all the exiles from Babylon to this
place!
7 Only hear what I have to say to you
and to all the people:
8 The prophets who preceded you and
me from earliest times have foretold war,Jeremiah 28.9–14
106
famine, and pestilence for many lands
and for great kingdoms.
9 If a prophet foretells prosperity, it will
be known that the LORD has sent him
only when his words come true.
10 Then the prophet Hananiah took
the yoke from the neck of the prophet
Jeremiah and broke it,
11 announcing to all the people, These
are the words of the LORD: So shall I
break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar
of Babylon; I shall break it off the necks
of all nations within two years. Then the
prophet Jeremiah went his way.
12 After Hananiah had broken the yoke
which had been on Jeremiah's neck, the
word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
13 Go and say to Hananiah: These are
the words of the LORD: You have broken
bars of wood; in their place you will get
bars of iron.
14 For these are the words of the
LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: I shall
lay an iron yoke on the necks of all
these nations, making them serve King
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. They will be
enslaved to him. I have given him even
the creatures of the wild.Jeremiah 28.15–29.4
107
15 Then Jeremiah said to Hananiah,
Listen, Hananiah. The LORD never sent
you, and you have led this nation to trust
in false prophecies.
16 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD: I shall remove you from the face
of the earth; within a year you will die,
because you have preached rebellion
against the LORD.
17 The prophet Hananiah died in the
seventh month of that same year.
1 Jeremiah sent a letter from
Jerusalem to the elders who were
left among the exiles, to the priests,
prophets, and all the people whom
Nebuchadnezzar had deported from
Jerusalem to Babylon,
2 after King Jeconiah, with the queen
mother and the eunuchs, the officers
of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen,
and the smiths, had left Jerusalem.
3 The prophet entrusted the letter to
Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah
son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah
of Judah had sent to Babylon to King
Nebuchadnezzar. This is what he wrote:
4 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: To all the exiles
29Jeremiah 29.5–11
108
whom I deported from Jerusalem to
Babylon:
5 Build houses and live in them; plant
gardens and eat the produce;
6 marry wives and rear families; choose
wives for your sons and give your
daughters to husbands, so that they may
bear sons and daughters. Increase there
and do not dwindle away.
7 Seek the welfare of any city to which I
have exiled you, and pray to the LORD
for it; on its welfare your welfare will
depend.
8 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Do not be
deceived by the prophets and diviners
among you, and pay no attention to the
women whom you set to dream dreams.
9 They prophesy falsely to you in my
name; I did not send them. This is the
word of the LORD.
10 These are the words of the LORD:
When a full seventy years have passed
over Babylon, I shall take up your cause
and make good my promise to bring you
back to this place.
11 I alone know my purpose for
you, says the LORD: wellbeing andJeremiah 29.12–18
109
not misfortune, and a long line of
descendants after you.
12 If you invoke me and come and pray
to me, I shall listen to you:
13 when you seek me, you will find me;
if you search wholeheartedly,
14 I shall let you find me, says the
LORD. I shall restore your fortunes; I
shall gather you from all the nations and
all the places to which I have banished
you, says the LORD, and restore you to
the place from which I carried you into
exile.
15 You say that the LORD has raised up
prophets for you in Babylon.
16 These are the words of the LORD
concerning the king who sits on the
throne of David and all the people who
live in this city, your fellow-countrymen
who have not gone into exile with you.
17 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: I am bringing sword, famine, and
pestilence on them, making them like
rotten figs, too bad to eat.
18 I shall pursue them with sword,
famine, and pestilence, and make them
abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the
earth, an object of execration and horror,Jeremiah 29.19–23
110
of derision and reproach among all the
nations to which I have banished them.
19 Just as they did not listen to my
words, says the LORD, when time and
again I sent my servants the prophets,
so you did not listen, says the LORD.
20 But now listen to the words of the
LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent
from Jerusalem to Babylon.
21 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel about Ahab
son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of
Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in
my name. I am handing them over to
King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he
will put them to death before your eyes.
22 Their names will be used by all the
exiles of Judah in Babylon when they
curse anyone; they will say: May the
LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab,
whom the king of Babylon roasted to
death in the fire!
23 For their conduct in Israel was an
outrage: they committed adultery with
their neighbours' wives, and prophesied
in my name without my authority, and
what they prophesied was false. I am heJeremiah 29.24–31
111
who knows and can testify. This is the
word of the LORD.
24 To Shemaiah the Nehelamite.
25 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: You have
sent a letter on your own authority to
Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, in
which you say:
26 The LORD has appointed you to be
priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, and
it is your duty, as officer in charge of the
LORD's house, to put every crazy person
who poses as a prophet into the stocks
and the pillory.
27 Why, then, have you not restrained
Jeremiah of Anathoth, who acts the
prophet among you?
28 On the strength of this he has sent
us a message in Babylon to say, Your
exile will be long; build houses and live
in them, plant gardens and eat their
produce.
29 When Zephaniah the priest read this
letter to Jeremiah the prophet,
30 this word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah:
31 Send and tell all the exiles that these
are the words of the LORD concerningJeremiah 29.32–30.6
112
Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because
Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though
I did not send him, and has led you to
trust in false prophecies,
32 these are now the words of the
LORD: I shall punish Shemaiah and his
posterity. He will leave no one to take
his place in this nation and witness the
wellbeing which I shall bestow on my
people, says the LORD, because he has
urged rebellion against me.
1 THE word which came to
Jeremiah from the LORD.
2 These are the words of the LORD the
God of Israel: Write on a scroll all that I
have said to you.
3 The time is coming when I shall
restore the fortunes of my people, both
Israel and Judah, says the LORD, and
bring them back to take possession of
the land which I gave to their ancestors.
4 This is what the LORD has said to
Israel and Judah.
5 These are the words of the LORD:
We have heard a cry of terror, of fear
without relief.
6 Enquire and see: can a man bear a
child? Why then do I see every man
30Jeremiah 30.7–11
113
gripping his sides like a woman in
labour? Why has every face turned
deadly pale?
7 How awful is that day: when has there
been its like? A time of anguish for
Jacob, yet he will come through it safely.
8 On that day, says the LORD of Hosts,
I shall break their yoke off their necks
and snap their cords; foreigners will no
longer reduce them to servitude;
9 they will serve the LORD their God
and David their king, whom I shall raise
up for them.
10 But do not be afraid, Jacob my
servant; Israel, do not despair, says the
LORD. For I shall bring you back safe
from afar, and your posterity from the
land where they are captives. Jacob
will be at rest once more, secure and
untroubled.
11 For I am with you to save you, says
the LORD. I shall make an end of all the
nations among whom I have dispersed
you, but I shall not make an end of you. I
shall discipline you only as you deserve,
I shall not leave you wholly unpunished.Jeremiah 30.12–18
114
12 For these are the words of the LORD
to Zion: Your wound is past healing; the
blow you suffered was cruel.
13 There can be no remedy for your
sore; the new skin cannot grow.
14 All your friends have forgotten you;
they look for you no longer. I have struck
you down as an enemy strikes, and have
punished you cruelly, because of your
great wickedness, your flagrant sins.
15 Why complain of your injury, that
your sore cannot be healed? Because
of your great wickedness, your flagrant
sins, I have done this to you.
16 Yet all who devoured you will
themselves be devoured; all your
oppressors will go into captivity; those
who plunder you will be plundered, and
those who despoil you I shall give up to
be spoiled.
17 I shall cause the new skin to grow
and heal your wounds, says the LORD,
although you are called outcast, Zion,
forsaken by all.
18 These are the words of the LORD:
I shall restore the fortunes of Jacob's
clans and show my love for his dwellings.
Every city will be rebuilt on its ownJeremiah 30.19–24
115
mound, every mansion will occupy its
traditional site.
19 From them praise will be heard and
sounds of merrymaking. I shall increase
them, they will not diminish; I shall
raise them to honour, no longer to be
despised.
20 Their children will be what once
they were, and their community will be
established in my sight. I shall punish all
their oppressors.
21 A ruler will appear, one of themselves;
a governor will arise from their own
number. I shall myself bring him near
and let him approach me, for who dare
risk his life by approaching me? says the
LORD.
22 So you will be my people, and I shall
be your God.
23 See what a scorching wind has gone
out from the LORD, a sweeping whirlwind
which whirls round the heads of the
wicked.
24 The LORD's fierce anger is not
to be turned aside until he has fully
accomplished his purposes. In days to
come you will understand.Jeremiah 31.1–7
116
1 At that time, says the LORD, I
31 shall be the God of all the families
of Israel, and they will be my people.
2 These are the words of the LORD: A
people that escaped the sword found
favour in the wilderness. The LORD went
to give rest to Israel;
3 from afar he appeared to them: I have
dearly loved you from of old, and still I
maintain my unfailing care for you.
4 Virgin Israel, I shall build you up
again, and you will be rebuilt. Again you
will provide yourself with tambourines,
and go forth with the merry throng of
dancers.
5 Again you will plant vineyards on the
hills of Samaria, and those who plant
them will enjoy the fruit;
6 for a day will come when the
watchmen cry out on Ephraim's hills,
Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD
our God.
7 For these are the words of the LORD:
Break into shouts of joy for Jacob's sake,
lead the nations, crying loud and clear,
sing out your praises and say: The LORD
has saved his people; he has preserved
a remnant of Israel.Jeremiah 31.8–12
117
8 See how I bring them from a northern
land; I shall gather them from the far
ends of the earth, among them the blind
and lame, the woman with child and the
woman in labour. A vast company,
9 they come home, weeping as they
come, but I shall comfort them and be
their escort. I shall lead them by streams
of water; their path will be smooth, they
will not stumble. For I have become
a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my
eldest son.
10 Listen to the word of the LORD, you
nations, announce it, make it known to
coastlands far away: He who scattered
Israel will gather them again and watch
over them as a shepherd watches his
flock.
11 For the LORD has delivered Jacob
and redeemed him from a foe too strong
for him.
12 They will come with shouts of joy to
Zion's height, radiant at the bounty of
the LORD: the grain, the new wine, and
the oil, the young of flock and herd. They
will be like a well-watered garden and
never languish again.Jeremiah 31.13–18
118
13 Girls will then dance for joy, and men
young and old will rejoice; I shall turn
their grief into gladness, comfort them,
and give them joy after sorrow.
14 I shall satisfy the priests with the fat
of the land and my people will have their
fill of my bounty. This is the word of the
LORD.
15 These are the words of the LORD:
Lamentation is heard in Ramah, and
bitter weeping: Rachel weeping for her
children and refusing to be comforted,
because they are no more.
16 These are the words of the LORD
to her: Cease your weeping, shed no
more tears; for there will be a reward for
your toil, and they will return from the
enemy's land.
17 There will be hope for your posterity;
your children will return within their own
borders.
18 I listened intently; Ephraim was
rocking in his grief: I was like a calf
unbroken to the yoke; you disciplined
me, and I accepted your discipline. Bring
me back and let me return, for you are
the LORD my God.Jeremiah 31.19–23
119
19 Though I broke away I have
repented: now that I am submissive I
beat my breast; in shame and remorse I
reproach myself for the sins of my youth.
20 Is Ephraim still so dear a son to me, a
child in whom I so delight that, as often
as I speak against him, I must think of
him again? Therefore my heart yearns
for him; I am filled with tenderness
towards him. This is the word of the
LORD.
21 Build cairns to mark your way, set up
signposts; make sure of the road, the
path which you will tread. Come back,
virgin Israel, come back to your cities
and towns.
22 How long will you waver, my wayward
child? For the LORD has created a new
thing in the earth: a woman will play a
man's part.
23 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Once more
will these words be heard in the land of
Judah and in her towns, when I restore
their fortunes: The LORD bless you,
abode of righteousness, holy mountain.Jeremiah 31.24–32
120
24 Ploughmen and shepherds with their
flocks will live together in Judah and all
her towns.
25 For I have given deep draughts to
the thirsty, and satisfied those who were
faint with hunger.
26 Thereupon I woke and looked about
me, and my sleep had been pleasant.
27 The days are coming, says the LORD,
when I shall sow Israel and Judah with
the seed of man and the seed of cattle.
28 As I watched over them with intent
to pull down and to uproot, to demolish
and destroy and inflict disaster, so now
I shall watch over them to build and to
plant. This is the word of the LORD.
29 In those days it will no longer be said,
Parents have eaten sour grapes and the
children's teeth are set on edge;
30 for everyone will die for his own
wrongdoing; he who eats the sour
grapes will find his own teeth set on
edge.
31 The days are coming, says the LORD,
when I shall establish a new covenant
with the people of Israel and Judah.
32 It will not be like the covenant I made
with their forefathers when I took themJeremiah 31.33–37
121
by the hand to lead them out of Egypt,
a covenant they broke, though I was
patient with them, says the LORD.
33 For this is the covenant I shall
establish with the Israelites after those
days, says the LORD: I shall set my law
within them, writing it on their hearts; I
shall be their God, and they will be my
people.
34 No longer need they teach one
another, neighbour or brother, to know
the LORD; all of them, high and low
alike, will know me, says the LORD, for I
shall forgive their wrongdoing, and their
sin I shall call to mind no more.
35 These are the words of the LORD,
who gave the sun for a light by day and
the moon and stars in their courses for a
light by night, who cleft the sea and its
waves roared; the LORD of Hosts is his
name.
36 Israel could no more cease to be a
nation in my sight, says the LORD, than
could this fixed order vanish before my
eyes.
37 These are the words of the LORD:
I could no more spurn the whole of
Israel because of what they have done,Jeremiah 31.38–32.3
122
than anyone could measure the heaven
above or fathom the depths of the earth
beneath. This is the word of the LORD.
38 The days are coming, says the
LORD, when Jerusalem will be rebuilt in
the LORD's honour from the Tower of
Hananel to the Corner Gate.
39 The measuring line will then be laid
straight out over the hill of Gareb and
round Goath.
40 All the valley and every field as far
as the wadi Kidron to the corner by the
Horse Gate eastwards will be holy to the
LORD. Never again will it be pulled down
or demolished.
1 The word which came to
Jeremiah from the LORD in the
tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah,
which was the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadrezzar.
2 At that time the forces of the
Babylonian king were besieging
Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah
was imprisoned in the court of the
guardhouse attached to the royal palace.
3 King Zedekiah had imprisoned him
after demanding what he meant by
this prophecy: These are the words of
32Jeremiah 32.4–8
123
the LORD: I shall give this city into the
power of the king of Babylon, and he will
capture it.
4 Nor will King Zedekiah of Judah
escape from the Chaldaeans; he will be
surrendered to the king of Babylon and
will speak with him face to face and see
him with his own eyes.
5 Zedekiah will be taken to Babylon and
will remain there until the day I visit him,
says the LORD. However much you fight
against the Chaldaeans you will have no
success.
6 Jeremiah said: This word of the LORD
came to me:
7 Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is
coming to you; he will say, Buy my field
at Anathoth; as next-of-kin you have the
right of redemption to buy it.
8 Just as the LORD had foretold, my
cousin Hanamel came to me in the court
of the guardhouse and said, Buy my
field at Anathoth in Benjamin. You have
the right of redemption and possession
as next-of-kin, so buy it for yourself. I
recognized that this instruction came
from the LORD,Jeremiah 32.9–15
124
9 so I bought the field at Anathoth from
my cousin Hanamel and weighed out
the price for him, seventeen shekels of
silver.
10 I signed and sealed the deed, had it
witnessed, and then weighed the money
on the scales.
11 I took my copies of the deed of
purchase, both the sealed and the
unsealed copies,
12 and handed them over to Baruch
son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the
presence of Hanamel my cousin and the
witnesses whose names were subscribed
on the deed of purchase, and of the
Judaeans sitting in the court of the
guardhouse.
13 In their presence I gave my
instructions to Baruch:
14 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Take these
copies of the deed of purchase, both
the sealed and the unsealed copies, and
deposit them in an earthenware jar so
that they may be preserved for a long
time to come.
15 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Houses,Jeremiah 32.16–22
125
fields, and vineyards will again be bought
and sold in this land.
16 After I handed over the deed of
purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I
offered this prayer to the LORD:
17 Lord GOD, maker of the heavens
and the earth by your great power and
outstretched arm, nothing is impossible
for you.
18 You keep faith with thousands but
punish the children for the sins of their
fathers. Great and mighty God whose
name is the LORD of Hosts,
19 great in purpose and mighty in
action, your eyes watch all the ways of
mortals, rewarding each according to his
conduct and as his deeds deserve.
20 You worked signs and portents in
Egypt and have continued them to
this day, both in Israel and among all
mankind, and have won for yourself
renown that lives on to this day.
21 You brought your people Israel out of
Egypt amid signs and portents, with a
strong hand and an outstretched arm,
and with great terror.
22 You gave them this land which
you promised with an oath to theirJeremiah 32.23–29
126
forefathers, a land flowing with milk and
honey.
23 They came and took possession of
it, but they did not obey you or follow
your law; they did not perform all you
commanded them to do, and so you have
brought on them this whole disaster:
24 siege-ramps, and men advancing
to take the city; and the city, victim of
sword, famine, and pestilence, is given
over to the attacking Chaldaeans. What
you threatened has come true, as you
see.
25 And yet, Lord GOD, you have bidden
me buy the field and have the deed
witnessed, even though the city is to be
given into the power of the Chaldaeans!
26 These are the words of the LORD to
Jeremiah:
27 I am the LORD, the God of all
mankind; is anything impossible for me?
28 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD: I am about to give this city into
the hands of the Chaldaeans and of King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he will
take it.
29 The Chaldaeans assailing this city will
enter and set it on fire; they will burnJeremiah 32.30–35
127
it down, together with the houses on
whose roofs sacrifices have been burnt
to Baal and drink-offerings poured out to
other gods, by which I was provoked to
anger.
30 From their earliest days Israel and
Judah have been doing what is wrong in
my eyes, provoking me to anger by their
idolatry, says the LORD.
31 For this city has so roused my anger
and my fury, from the time it was built
down to this day, that I mean to rid
myself of it.
32 Israel and Judah, their kings, officers,
priests, prophets, and the people of
Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem,
have provoked me to anger by their
wrongdoing.
33 They have turned their backs on me
and averted their faces; though I taught
them again and again, they would not
hear or learn their lesson.
34 They set up their loathsome idols in
the house which bears my name and so
defiled it.
35 They built shrines to Baal in the valley
of Ben-hinnom, at which to offer up their
sons and daughters to Molech. That wasJeremiah 32.36–41
128
no command of mine to them, nor did it
ever enter my mind that they should do
this abominable thing, so causing Judah
to sin.
36 Now, therefore, these are the words
of the LORD the God of Israel to this
city of which you say, It is being given
over to the king of Babylon, by sword,
famine, and pestilence:
37 I shall gather them from all the lands
to which I banished them in my furious
anger and great wrath; I shall bring
them back to this place and let them
dwell there undisturbed.
38 They will be my people and I shall be
their God.
39 I shall give them singleness of heart
and one way of life so that they will fear
me at all times, for their own good and
the good of their children after them.
40 I shall enter into an everlasting
covenant with them, to follow them
unfailingly with my bounty; I shall put
fear of me into their hearts, and so they
will not turn away from me.
41 It will be a joy to me to do them
good, and faithfully with all my heart
and soul I shall plant them in this land.Jeremiah 32.42–33.4
129
42 For these are the words of the LORD:
As I brought upon this people all this
great disaster, so shall I bring them
all the prosperity which I now promise
them.
43 Fields will again be bought and sold
in this land of which you now say, It is
a desolation abandoned by man and
beast; it is given over to the Chaldaeans.
44 Fields will be bought and sold,
deeds signed, sealed, and witnessed,
in Benjamin, in the neighbourhood of
Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, of the
hill-country, of the Shephelah, and of the
Negeb; for I shall restore their fortunes.
This is the word of the LORD.
1 The word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah a second time while he
was still imprisoned in the court of the
guardhouse:
2 These are the words of the LORD
who made the earth, who formed and
established it; the LORD is his name:
3 If you call to me I shall answer, and
tell you great and mysterious things of
which you are still unaware.
4 These are the words of the LORD
the God of Israel about the houses in
33Jeremiah 33.5–10
130
this city and the royal palaces of Judah
which are razed to the ground, about
siege-ramp and sword,
5 and the Chaldaean attackers who
leave the houses full of corpses: I struck
them down in anger and rage, and hid
my face from this city because of all their
wicked ways.
6 Now I shall bring healing and care for
her; I shall cure Judah and Israel, and
let them see lasting peace and security.
7 I shall restore their fortunes and
rebuild them as once they were.
8 I shall cleanse them of all the
wickedness and sin that they have
committed, and forgive all the evil deeds
they have done in rebellion against me.
9 This city will win me renown and praise
and glory before all the nations of the
world, as they hear of all the blessings
I bestow on her; and they will be filled
with awe and deeply moved because
of all the blessings and the prosperity
which I bring on her.
10 These are the words of the LORD:
You say of this place, It lies in ruins,
without people or animals throughout
the towns of Judah and the streets ofJeremiah 33.11–14
131
Jerusalem. It is all a waste, inhabited by
neither man nor beast.
11 Yet in this place will be heard once
more the sounds of joy and gladness,
the voices of bridegroom and bride; here
too will be heard voices shouting, Praise
the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good;
his love endures for ever, as they offer
praise and thanksgiving in the house of
the LORD. For I shall restore the fortunes
of the land as once they were. This is the
word of the LORD.
12 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: In this place and in all its towns,
now ruined and devoid of both people
and animals, there will once more be
sheepfolds where shepherds may keep
their flocks.
13 In the towns of the hill-country, of the
Shephelah, of the Negeb, in Benjamin,
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and
the towns of Judah, flocks will once more
pass under the shepherd's hand as he
counts them. This is the word of the
LORD.
14 The days are coming, says the LORD,
when I shall bestow on Israel and Judah
all the blessings I have promised them.Jeremiah 33.15–21
132
15 In those days, at that time, I shall
make a righteous Branch spring from
David's line; he will maintain law and
justice in the land.
16 In those days Judah will be kept safe
and Jerusalem will live undisturbed. This
will be the name given to him: The LORD
our Righteousness.
17 For these are the words of the LORD:
David will never lack a successor on the
throne of Israel,
18 nor will there ever be lacking
a levitical priest to present whole-
offerings, to burn grain-offerings, and to
make other offerings every day.
19 This word came from the LORD to
Jeremiah:
20 These are the words of the LORD:
It would be as unthinkable to annul the
covenant that I made for the day and
the night, so that they should fall out of
their proper order,
21 as to annul my covenant with my
servant David, so that he would have
none of his line to sit on his throne;
likewise it would be unthinkable to annul
my covenant with the levitical priests
who minister to me.Jeremiah 33.22–34.1
133
22 Like the innumerable host of heaven
or the countless sands of the sea, I shall
increase the descendants of my servant
David and the Levites who minister to
me.
23 The word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah:
24 Have you not observed how this
people have said, It is the two families
whom he chose that the LORD has
rejected? So others will despise my
people and no longer regard them as a
nation.
25 These are the words of the LORD:
If there were no covenant for day and
night, and if I had not established a fixed
order in heaven and earth,
26 then I could spurn the descendants
of Jacob and of my servant David, and
not take any of David's line to be rulers
over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. But in my compassion I shall
restore their fortunes.
1 THE word which came to
Jeremiah from the LORD when
King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and his
whole army, along with all his vassal
34Jeremiah 34.2–6
134
kingdoms and nations, were attacking
Jerusalem and all her towns.
2 These are the words of the LORD
the God of Israel: Go and say to King
Zedekiah of Judah: These are the words
of the LORD: I shall hand over this city
to the king of Babylon and he will burn it
to the ground.
3 You yourself will not escape; your
capture is certain, and you will be
delivered into his hands. You will see him
with your own eyes, and he will speak
to you face to face, and you will go to
Babylon.
4 But listen to the LORD's word to you,
King Zedekiah of Judah. This is his word:
You will not die by the sword;
5 you will die a peaceful death, and they
will kindle funeral fires in your honour
like the fires kindled in former times for
the kings your ancestors who preceded
you. Alas, my lord! they will say as they
beat their breasts in mourning for you.
It is a promise I have made. This is the
word of the LORD.
6 The prophet Jeremiah repeated all this
to King Zedekiah of Judah in JerusalemJeremiah 34.7–13
135
7 while the army of the king of Babylon
was attacking Jerusalem and the
remaining towns in Judah, namely
Lachish and Azekah, the only fortified
towns left there.
8 The word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD after King Zedekiah had
entered into an agreement with all the
people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom
for their slaves:
9 everyone who had Hebrew slaves,
male or female, was to set them free;
no one was to keep a fellow-Jew in
servitude.
10 All the officers and people, having
entered this agreement to set free their
slaves, both male and female, and not
to keep them in servitude any longer,
fulfilled its terms and let them go.
11 Afterwards, however, they changed
their minds and forced back again into
slavery the men and women whom they
had freed.
12 Then this word came from the LORD
to Jeremiah:
13 These are the words of the LORD the
God of Israel: I made a covenant with
your forefathers when I brought themJeremiah 34.14–18
136
out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
These were its terms:
14 Within seven years each of you
must liberate any Hebrew who has sold
himself to you as a slave and has served
you for six years. Your forefathers did
not listen to me or obey me,
15 but recently you proclaimed freedom
for the slaves and made an agreement
in my presence, in the house that bears
my name, and so did what is right in my
eyes.
16 Now, however, you have renounced
this agreement and profaned my name
by taking back the slaves you had set
free and forcing them all, both male and
female, to become your slaves again.
17 Therefore these are the words of
the LORD: After you had proclaimed
freedom, a deliverance for your kinsmen
and your neighbours, you did not obey
me; so I shall proclaim a deliverance
for you, says the LORD, a deliverance
to sword, pestilence, and famine, and
I shall make you abhorrent to all the
kingdoms of the earth.
18 You have violated my covenant and
have not fulfilled the terms to which youJeremiah 34.19–35.2
137
yourselves had agreed before me; so I
shall treat you like the calf which was cut
in two for all to pass between the pieces,
19 the officers of Judah and Jerusalem,
the eunuchs and priests, and all the
people of the land.
20 I shall give them up to their enemies
who seek their lives; their dead bodies
will be food for birds of prey and wild
beasts.
21 I shall deliver King Zedekiah of Judah
and his officers to their enemies who
seek their lives and to the army of the
king of Babylon, which is now raising the
siege.
22 I shall give the command, says the
LORD, and bring them back to this
city. They will attack it, capture it, and
burn it to the ground. I shall make the
towns and cities of Judah desolate and
unpeopled.
1 This is the word which came to
Jeremiah from the LORD in the
days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of
Judah:
2 Go and speak to the Rechabites; bring
them to one of the rooms in the house of
the LORD and offer them wine to drink.
35Jeremiah 35.3–8
138
3 So I fetched Jaazaniah son of
Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, with his
brothers and all his sons, the whole
Rechabite family.
4 I brought them into the house of the
LORD to the room of the sons of Hanan
son of Igdaliah, the man of God; this
adjoins the officers' room above that of
Maaseiah son of Shallum, the keeper of
the threshold.
5 I set bowls full of wine and drinking-
cups before the Rechabites and invited
them to drink;
6 but they said, We never drink wine,
for our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab
laid this charge on us: You must never
drink wine, neither you nor your children.
7 Do not build houses or sow seed or
plant vineyards; you are to have none of
these things. Instead, you are to remain
tent-dwellers all your days, so that you
may live long on the soil where you are
sojourners.
8 We have honoured all the commands
of our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab
and have drunk no wine all our lives,
neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons,
nor our daughters.Jeremiah 35.9–15
139
9 We have not built houses to live in,
nor have we possessed vineyards or
sown fields;
10 we have lived in tents, obeying and
observing fully the charge which our
forefather Jonadab laid on us.
11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of
Babylon invaded the land we said, Let us
go to Jerusalem to escape the advancing
Chaldaean and Aramaean armies. And
we have stayed in Jerusalem.
12 Then the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah:
13 These are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Go and
say to the Judaeans and the citizens
of Jerusalem: Will you never accept
correction and obey my words? says the
LORD.
14 The command of Jonadab son of
Rechab to his descendants not to drink
wine has been honoured; to this day
they do not drink wine, for they obey
their ancestor's command. But though I
have warned you time and again, you
have not obeyed me.
15 Time and again I sent all my servants
the prophets to say, Turn back everyJeremiah 35.16–19
140
one of you from evil conduct, mend your
ways, and cease to follow other gods
and serve them; then you will remain in
the land that I have given to you and to
your forefathers. Yet you did not obey or
listen to me.
16 The descendants of Jonadab son of
Rechab have honoured the command
their forefather laid on them, but this
people have not listened to me.
17 Therefore, these are the words of
the LORD the God of Hosts, the God of
Israel: Because they did not listen when
I spoke to them or respond when I called
them, I shall bring on Judah and on all
the citizens of Jerusalem the full disaster
with which I threatened them.
18 To the Rechabites Jeremiah said:
These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: Because you
have kept the command of Jonadab your
forefather, obeying all his instructions
and carrying out all that he told you to
do,
19 therefore these are the words of the
LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: There
will never be lacking in my service a man
of the line of Jonadab son of Rechab.Jeremiah 36.1–6
141
1 IN the fourth year of Jehoiakim
36 son of Josiah, king of Judah, this
word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
2 Take a scroll and write on it all the
words I have spoken to you about
Jerusalem, Judah, and all the nations,
from the day that I first spoke to you
during the reign of Josiah down to the
present day.
3 Perhaps the house of Judah will be
warned of all the disaster I am planning
to inflict on them, and everyone will
abandon his evil conduct; then I shall
forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.
4 Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of
Neriah, and Baruch wrote on the scroll
at Jeremiah's dictation everything the
LORD had said to him.
5 He gave Baruch this instruction: As I
am debarred from going to the LORD's
house,
6 you must go there and on a fast-day
read aloud to the people the words of
the LORD from the scroll you wrote at
my dictation. You are to read them in the
hearing of all those who come in from
the towns of Judah.Jeremiah 36.7–12
142
7 Then perhaps they will petition the
LORD, and everyone will abandon his evil
conduct; for in great anger and wrath
the LORD has threatened this people.
8 Baruch son of Neriah did all that the
prophet Jeremiah had told him, about
reading from the scroll the words of the
LORD in the LORD's house.
9 In the ninth month of the fifth year
of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,
king of Judah, all the people in Jerusalem
and all who came there from the towns
of Judah proclaimed a fast before the
LORD.
10 Then in the LORD's house Baruch
read aloud Jeremiah's words from the
scroll to all the people; he read them
from the room of Gemariah son of the
adjutant-general Shaphan, which was in
the upper court at the entrance to the
New Gate of the LORD's house.
11 When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son
of Shaphan, heard all the LORD's words
from the scroll
12 he went down to the palace, to the
chief adviser's room, where he found
the officers all in session: Elishama the
chief adviser, Delaiah son of Shemaiah,Jeremiah 36.13–20
143
Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of
Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and
all the other officers.
13 Micaiah reported to them everything
he had heard Baruch read from the scroll
in the hearing of the people.
14 Then the officers sent Jehudi son of
Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of
Cushi, to Baruch with this order: Come
here and bring the scroll from which you
read to the people. When Baruch son of
Neriah appeared before them with the
scroll,
15 they said to him, Sit down and read
it to us, and he did so.
16 When they had listened to it, they
turned to each other in alarm and said,
We must certainly report this to the king.
17 They asked Baruch to explain to them
how he had come to write all this.
18 He answered, Jeremiah dictated
every word of it to me, and I wrote it
down with ink on the scroll.
19 The officers said to him, You and
Jeremiah must go into hiding so that no
one may know where you are.
20 When they had deposited the scroll in
the room of Elishama the chief adviser,Jeremiah 36.21–26
144
they went to the court and reported the
whole affair to the king.
21 The king sent Jehudi for the scroll
and, when he had fetched it from the
room of Elishama the chief adviser,
Jehudi read it out to the king and to all
the officers in attendance on him.
22 Since it was the ninth month of the
year, the king was sitting in his winter
apartments with a fire burning in a
brazier in front of him.
23 Every time Jehudi read three or four
columns of the scroll, the king cut them
off with a penknife and threw them
into the fire in the brazier. He went on
doing so until the entire scroll had been
destroyed on the fire.
24 Neither the king nor any of his
courtiers showed any alarm or tore their
clothes as they listened to these words;
25 and though Elnathan, Delaiah, and
Gemariah begged the king not to burn
the scroll, he refused to listen,
26 but ordered Jerahmeel, a royal prince,
Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son
of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and
the prophet Jeremiah. But the LORD had
hidden them.Jeremiah 36.27–32
145
27 After the king had burnt the scroll
with all that Baruch had written on it
at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the
LORD came to Jeremiah:
28 Take another scroll and write on it
everything that was on the first scroll
which King Jehoiakim of Judah burnt.
29 You are to say to the king: These are
the words of the LORD: You burnt that
scroll and said, Why have you written
here that the king of Babylon will come
and destroy this land and exterminate
both man and beast?
30 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD about King Jehoiakim of Judah:
He will have no descendant to succeed
him on the throne of David, and his dead
body will be exposed to scorching heat
by day and frost by night.
31 I shall punish him, his offspring, and
his courtiers for their wickedness, and
I shall bring down on them and on the
citizens of Jerusalem and on the people
of Judah all the disasters with which I
threatened them, for they turned a deaf
ear to me.
32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll
and gave it to the scribe Baruch son ofJeremiah 37.1–6
146
Neriah, who wrote on it at Jeremiah's
dictation all the words of the book which
Jehoiakim king of Judah had burnt in the
fire; and much else was added to the
same effect.
1 Zedekiah son of Josiah was set
on the throne of Judah by King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, in place of
Coniah son of Jehoiakim,
2 but neither he nor his courtiers nor
the people of the land heeded the words
which the LORD spoke through the
prophet Jeremiah.
3 King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehucal
son of Shelemiah and the priest
Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah
to say to him, Intercede on our behalf
with the LORD our God.
4 At the time Jeremiah was free to come
and go among the people; he had not
yet been committed to prison.
5 Meanwhile Pharaoh's army had
marched out of Egypt, and when
the Chaldaeans who were besieging
Jerusalem were apprised of this they
raised the siege.
6 Then the word of the LORD came to
the prophet Jeremiah:
37Jeremiah 37.7–13
147
7 These are the words of the LORD the
God of Israel: Take this message to the
king of Judah who sent you to consult
me: Pharaoh's army which marched out
to your aid is on its way back to Egypt,
its own land,
8 and the Chaldaeans will return to the
attack. They will capture this city and
burn it to the ground.
9 These are the words of the LORD: Do
not delude yourselves by imagining that
the Chaldaeans will go away and leave
you alone. They will not;
10 supposing that you were to defeat
the whole Chaldaean force now fighting
against you, and only the wounded were
left lying in their tents, even they would
rise and burn down this city.
11 After the Chaldaean army raised the
siege of Jerusalem in the face of the
advance of Pharaoh's army,
12 Jeremiah was on the way out from
Jerusalem to go into Benjamite territory
to take possession of his holding among
the people there.
13 Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of
Hananiah, the officer of the guard, was
at the Benjamin Gate when JeremiahJeremiah 37.14–19
148
reached it, and he arrested the prophet,
accusing him of defecting to the
Chaldaeans.
14 That is not true! said Jeremiah. I am
not going over to the Chaldaeans. Irijah
refused to listen but brought him under
arrest before the officers.
15 The officers, furious with Jeremiah,
had him flogged and imprisoned in the
house of Jonathan the scribe, which had
been converted into a jail.
16 Jeremiah was put into a vaulted pit
beneath the house, and he remained
there many days.
17 King Zedekiah had Jeremiah brought
to him and questioned him privately in
the palace, asking if there was a word
from the LORD. There is, said Jeremiah;
you will fall into the hands of the king of
Babylon.
18 Jeremiah went on, What wrong have
I done to you or your courtiers or this
people, that you have thrown me into
prison?
19 Where are your prophets who
prophesied that the king of Babylon
would not attack you or this country?Jeremiah 37.20–38.4
149
20 I pray you now, my lord king, give
me a hearing and let my petition be
accepted: do not send me back to the
house of Jonathan the scribe, or I shall
die there.
21 Then King Zedekiah gave the order
for Jeremiah to be committed to the
court of the guardhouse, and as long
as there was bread in the city he was
granted a daily ration of one loaf from
the Street of the Bakers. So Jeremiah
remained in the court of the guardhouse.
1 Shephatiah son of Mattan,
Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal
son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son
of Malchiah heard how Jeremiah was
addressing all the people; he was saying:
2 These are the words of the LORD:
Whoever remains in this city will die
by sword, famine, or pestilence, but
whoever surrenders to the Chaldaeans
will survive; he will escape with his life.
3 These are the words of the LORD: This
city will assuredly be delivered into the
power of the king of Babylon's army, and
be captured.
4 The officers said to the king, This man
ought to be put to death. By talking in
38Jeremiah 38.5–10
150
this way he is demoralizing the soldiers
left in the city and indeed the rest of the
people. It is not the people's welfare he
seeks but their ruin.
5 King Zedekiah said, He is in your
hands; the king is powerless against
you.
6 So they took Jeremiah and put him
into the cistern in the court of the
guardhouse, letting him down with
ropes. There was no water in the cistern,
only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the
mud.
7 Ebed-melech the Cushite, a eunuch,
who was in the palace, heard that they
had put Jeremiah into a cistern and he
went to tell the king, who was seated at
the Benjamin Gate.
8 (38:7)
9 Your majesty, he said, these men have
acted viciously in their treatment of the
prophet Jeremiah. They have thrown him
into a cistern, and he will die of hunger
where he is, for there is no more bread
in the city.
10 The king instructed Ebed-melech the
Cushite to take three men with him andJeremiah 38.11–16
151
hoist Jeremiah out of the cistern before
he perished.
11 Ebed-melech went to the palace
with the men and took some tattered,
cast-off clothes from a storeroom and
lowered them with ropes to Jeremiah in
the cistern.
12 He called to Jeremiah, Put these old
clothes under your armpits to pad the
ropes. Jeremiah did so,
13 and they pulled him up out of
the cistern with the ropes. Jeremiah
remained in the court of the guardhouse.
14 King Zedekiah sent for the prophet
Jeremiah and had him brought to the
third entrance of the LORD's house. I
want to ask you something, he said to
him; hide nothing from me.
15 Jeremiah answered, If I speak out,
you will certainly put me to death; if I
offer advice, you will disregard it.
16 King Zedekiah secretly made this
promise on oath to Jeremiah: By the
life of the LORD who gave us our lives,
I shall not put you to death, nor shall
I hand you over to these men who are
seeking your life.Jeremiah 38.17–22
152
17 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, These
are the words of the LORD the God of
Hosts, the God of Israel: If you go out
and surrender to the officers of the king
of Babylon, you will live and this city will
not be burnt down; you and your family
will survive.
18 If, however, you do not surrender
to the officers of the king of Babylon,
this city will fall into the hands of the
Chaldaeans, who will burn it down; you
yourself will not escape them.
19 The king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid
of the Judaeans who have gone over to
the enemy. The Chaldaeans may give
me up to them, and their treatment of
me will be ruthless.
20 Jeremiah answered, You will not
be given up. If you obey the LORD in
everything I tell you, all will be well with
you and your life will be spared.
21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is
what the LORD has shown me:
22 all the women left in the king of
Judah's palace will be led out to the
officers of the king of Babylon. Those
women will say to you: Your own friends
have misled you and proved too strongJeremiah 38.23–39.1
153
for you; when your feet sank in the mud
they turned and left you.
23 All your women and children will
be led out to the Chaldaeans and you
yourself will not escape; you will be
seized by the king of Babylon, and this
city will be burnt down.
24 Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, On pain
of death let no one know about this
conversation.
25 If the officers hear that I have been
speaking with you and they come and
say to you, Tell us what you said to
the king and what he said to you; hide
nothing from us, and we shall not put
you to death,
26 you must reply, I was petitioning the
king not to send me back to the house
of Jonathan to die there.
27 The officers did all come and question
Jeremiah, and he said to them just what
the king had told him to say; so they left
off questioning him and were none the
wiser.
28 Jeremiah remained in the court of the
guardhouse till the day Jerusalem fell.
1 IN the tenth month of the
ninth year of the reign of King
39Jeremiah 39.2–5
154
Zedekiah of Judah, King Nebuchadrezzar
of Babylon advanced with his whole
army against Jerusalem, and they laid
siege to it.
2 In the fourth month of the eleventh
year of Zedekiah, on the ninth day of the
month, the city capitulated.
3 All the officers of the king of Babylon
came in and took their seats by the
middle gate: Nergalsarezer of Simmagir,
Nebusarsekim the chief eunuch,
Nergalsarezer the commander of the
frontier troops, and all the other officers
of the king of Babylon.
4 When King Zedekiah of Judah saw
them, he and all his armed escort left
the city by night and, fleeing by way of
the king's garden through the gate called
Between the Two Walls, they made their
escape towards the Arabah.
5 The Chaldaean soldiers set off in
pursuit and overtook Zedekiah in the
lowlands of Jericho. He was seized and
brought before King Nebuchadrezzar
of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of
Hamath, where sentence was passed on
him.Jeremiah 39.6–13
155
6 The king of Babylon had Zedekiah's
sons slain before his eyes at Riblah; he
also had all the nobles of Judah put to
death.
7 Then Zedekiah's eyes were blinded,
and he was bound in bronze fetters to be
brought to Babylon.
8 The Chaldaeans burnt the royal palace
and the house of the LORD and the
houses of the people, and demolished
Jerusalem's walls.
9 Nebuzaradan captain of the bodyguard
deported to Babylon the rest of the
people left in the city, those who had
defected to him, and any remaining
artisans.
10 He left behind only the poorest class
of people, those who owned nothing
at all; to them he gave vineyards and
fields.
11 King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon sent
orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan
captain of the guard.
12 Hold him, he said, and take good
care of him; let him come to no harm,
but do for him whatever he asks.
13 So Nebuzaradan captain of the guard
sent Nebushazban the chief eunuch,Jeremiah 39.14–40.1
156
Nergalsarezer the commander of the
frontier troops, and all the chief officers
of the king of Babylon,
14 and they fetched Jeremiah from the
court of the guardhouse and handed
him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam,
son of Shaphan, to take him out to his
residence. So he stayed with his own
people.
15 While Jeremiah was imprisoned the
word of the LORD had come to him in
the court of the guardhouse:
16 Go and say to Ebed-melech the
Cushite: These are the words of the
LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: I shall
make good the words I have spoken
against this city, foretelling ruin and not
wellbeing, and when that day comes you
will recall them.
17 But I shall preserve you on that day,
says the LORD, and you will not be
handed over to the men you fear.
18 I shall keep you safe, and you will not
fall a victim to the sword; because you
trusted in me you will escape with your
life. This is the word of the LORD.
1 THE word which came from
the LORD about Jeremiah:
40Jeremiah 40.2–5
157
Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had
taken him in chains to Ramah along
with the other captives from Jerusalem
and Judah who were being deported to
Babylon. After he set Jeremiah free,
2 he said to him, The LORD your God
threatened this place with disaster,
3 and has duly carried out his threat
that this should happen to the people
because they have sinned against the
LORD and not obeyed him.
4 But as for you, Jeremiah, I am now
removing the fetters from your wrists. If
you so wish, come with me to Babylon,
and I shall take good care of you; but
if you prefer not to come, very well.
The whole country lies before you; go
wherever you think best.
5 Before Jeremiah could answer,
Nebuzaradan went on, Go back to
Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
whom the king of Babylon has appointed
governor of the cities and towns of
Judah, and stay with him among your
people; or go anywhere else you choose.
Then the captain of the guard gave him
provisions and a gift, and dismissed him.Jeremiah 40.6–10
158
6 Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah
son of Ahikam and stayed with him
among the people left in the land.
7 When all the captains of the armed
bands in the countryside and their men
heard that the king of Babylon had
appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to
be governor of the land, and had put
him in charge of the poorer class of
the population, the men, women, and
children who had not been deported to
Babylon,
8 they, together with their men, came
to him at Mizpah; they were Ishmael
son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and
Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son
of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from
Netophah, and Jezaniah of Beth-maacah.
9 Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of
Shaphan, gave them this assurance: Do
not be afraid to serve the Chaldaeans.
Settle down in the land, serve the king
of Babylon, and all will be well with you.
10 I for my part am to stay in Mizpah
and attend on the Chaldaeans whenever
they come to us; you can harvest the
wine, summer fruits, and oil, store themJeremiah 40.11–15
159
in jars, and settle in the towns you have
taken over.
11 Likewise when all the Judaeans who
were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other
countries, heard that the king of Babylon
had left a remnant in Judah and had set
over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son
of Shaphan,
12 they came back to Judah from all the
places where they had scattered and
presented themselves before Gedaliah
at Mizpah; and they gathered in a good
harvest of wine and summer fruit.
13 Johanan son of Kareah and all the
captains of the armed bands from the
countryside came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
14 and said to him, Are you aware that
Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent
Ishmael son of Nethaniah to assassinate
you? But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would
not believe them.
15 Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke
privately to Gedaliah: Let me go,
unknown to anyone else, and kill
Ishmael son of Nethaniah. Why let him
assassinate you, and so allow all the
Judaeans who have rallied round you toJeremiah 40.16–41.5
160
be scattered and the remnant of Judah
to be lost?
16 Gedaliah son of Ahikam answered
him, Do no such thing. What you are
saying about Ishmael is not true.
1 In the seventh month Ishmael
son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama,
who was a member of the royal house,
came with ten men to Gedaliah son
of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were
eating together there,
2 Ishmael son of Nethaniah and his ten
men rose and assassinated Gedaliah son
of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the
king of Babylon had appointed governor
of the land.
3 Ishmael also murdered all the
Judaeans who were with Gedaliah in
Mizpah as well as the Chaldaean soldiers
stationed there.
4 Next day, while the murder of Gedaliah
was not yet common knowledge,
5 eighty men arrived from Shechem,
Shiloh, and Samaria. They had shaved
off their beards, torn their clothes, and
gashed their bodies; they were carrying
grain-offerings and frankincense to
present to the house of the LORD.
41Jeremiah 41.6–10
161
6 Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out
from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as
he went, and when he met them he said,
Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.
7 But as soon as they were well inside
the town, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and
his men murdered them and threw their
bodies into a cistern,
8 all except ten of them who said to
Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have
a secret hoard in the country, wheat
and barley, oil and honey. So he held
his hand and did not kill them with the
others.
9 The cistern into which he threw all the
bodies of those whom he had killed was
the large one which King Asa had made
when threatened by King Baasha of
Israel, and this Ishmael son of Nethaniah
filled with the slain.
10 He rounded up the rest of the people
in Mizpah, that is the king's daughters
and all who had remained in Mizpah
when Nebuzaradan captain of the guard
appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam
governor; and with these he set out to
cross over to the Ammonites.Jeremiah 41.11–16
162
11 When Johanan son of Kareah and the
captains of the armed bands heard of all
the crimes committed by Ishmael son of
Nethaniah,
12 they mustered their men and set out
to attack him. They came up with him by
the great pool in Gibeon.
13 The people with Ishmael were glad
when they saw Johanan son of Kareah
and all the captains of the armed bands
with him,
14 while those whom Ishmael had taken
prisoner at Mizpah turned and joined
Johanan son of Kareah.
15 But Ishmael son of Nethaniah
escaped from Johanan with eight men to
make his way to the Ammonites.
16 Johanan son of Kareah and the
captains of the armed bands took
from Mizpah all the survivors whom
he had rescued from Ishmael son of
Nethaniah after the murder of Gedaliah
son of Ahikam -- men, both armed
and unarmed, women, children, and
eunuchs, whom he had brought back
from Gibeon.Jeremiah 41.17–42.4
163
17 They started out and broke their
journey at Kimham's holding near
Bethlehem, on their way into Egypt
18 to escape the Chaldaeans. They were
afraid of them because Ishmael son of
Nethaniah had assassinated Gedaliah
son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon
had appointed governor of the country.
1 All the captains of the armed
bands, including Johanan son of
Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah,
together with the entire people, high and
low, approached
2 the prophet Jeremiah and said, May
our petition be acceptable to you:
Intercede with the LORD your God on
our behalf and on behalf of this remnant;
as you see for yourself, only a few of us
remain out of many.
3 Pray that the LORD your God may tell
us which way we are to take and what
we ought to do.
4 Jeremiah answered, I have heard your
request. I shall pray to the LORD your
God as you ask, and whatever answer
the LORD gives I shall tell you, keeping
nothing back.
42Jeremiah 42.5–11
164
5 They said to Jeremiah, May the LORD
be a true and faithful witness against
us if we do not act exactly as the LORD
your God sends you to tell us.
6 Whether it is favourable to us or
not, we shall obey the LORD our God
to whom we are sending you, in order
that it may be well with us through our
obedience to him.
7 When after an interval of ten days the
word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,
8 he summoned Johanan son of Kareah,
all the captains of the armed bands who
were with him, and all the people, both
high and low,
9 and addressed them: These are the
words of the LORD the God of Israel, to
whom you sent me with your petition.
10 If you remain in this land, then I shall
build you up and not pull you down,
I shall plant you and not uproot you;
I grieve for the disaster which I have
inflicted on you.
11 Do not be afraid of the king of
Babylon whom you now fear. Do not be
afraid of him, says the LORD, for I am
with you, to save you and deliver you
from his power.Jeremiah 42.12–18
165
12 I shall show you compassion, so that
he too has compassion on you, and will
let you stay on your own soil.
13 But it may be that you will disobey
the LORD your God and insist, We are
not going to stay in this land.
14 No, we shall go to Egypt, where we
shall see no sign of war, never hear the
sound of the trumpet, and suffer no lack
of food; it is there we shall live.
15 In that case hear the word of the
LORD, you remnant of Judah. These are
the words of the LORD of Hosts the God
of Israel: If you are determined to go to
Egypt, if you do go and settle there,
16 then the sword you fear will overtake
you there in Egypt, and the famine you
dread will dog you, even in Egypt, and
there you will die.
17 All who insist on going to settle in
Egypt will die by sword, famine, or
pestilence; not one will escape or survive
the disaster I shall bring on them.
18 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: As my anger
and my wrath were poured out on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will my
wrath be poured out on you when youJeremiah 42.19–43.2
166
go to Egypt; you will become an object
of execration and horror, of cursing and
reproach, and you will never see this
place again.
19 To you, then, remnant of Judah, the
LORD says: Do not go to Egypt. Make no
mistake; I give you solemn warning this
day.
20 You deceived yourselves when you
sent me to the LORD your God and said,
Intercede for us with the LORD our God;
tell us exactly what the LORD our God
says and we shall do it.
21 I have told it all to you today; but
you have not obeyed the LORD your God
in what he sent me to tell you.
22 So now be sure of this: you will die
by sword, famine, and pestilence in the
place where you want to go and live.
1 When Jeremiah had finished
reporting to the people all that
the LORD their God had sent him to say,
2 Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan
son of Kareah and their party had the
effrontery to say to Jeremiah, You are
lying! The LORD our God has not sent
you to forbid us to go and make our
home in Egypt;
43Jeremiah 43.3–9
167
3 it is Baruch son of Neriah who is
inciting you against us in order to put us
in the power of the Chaldaeans, to be
killed or deported to Babylon.
4 Johanan son of Kareah and the
captains of the armed bands and all
the people refused to obey the LORD's
command to stay in Judah.
5 Johanan and the captains collected the
remnant of Judah, all who had returned
from the countries among which they
had been scattered to make their home
in Judah --
6 men, women, and children, including
the king's daughters, everyone whom
Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had
left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son
of Shaphan, as well as the prophet
Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah;
7 and in defiance of the LORD's
command they all went to Egypt and
arrived at Tahpanhes.
8 The word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
9 Take some large stones and set
them in cement in the pavement at
the entrance to Pharaoh's palace inJeremiah 43.10–44.1
168
Tahpanhes. Let the Judaeans see you do
it,
10 and say to them: These are the
words of the LORD of Hosts the God of
Israel: I shall send for my servant King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he will
place his throne on these stones that I
have set here, and spread his canopy
over them.
11 He will come and vanquish Egypt:
Those who are for the plague shall go
to the plague, those for captivity to
captivity, and those for the sword to the
sword.
12 He will set fire to the temples of the
Egyptian gods, burning the buildings and
carrying the gods into captivity. He will
scour the land of Egypt as a shepherd
scours his clothes to rid them of lice. He
will come out of Egypt unscathed.
13 He will smash the sacred pillars of
Beth-shemesh in Egypt and burn down
the temples of the Egyptian gods.
1 The word that came to Jeremiah
for all the Judaeans living in
Egypt, at Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and
in the district of Pathros:
44Jeremiah 44.2–7
169
2 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: You have seen
all the disaster I brought on Jerusalem
and on all the towns of Judah: today
they lie in ruins and are left uninhabited,
3 all because of the wickedness of those
who provoked me to anger by going after
other gods, gods unknown to them, by
burning sacrifices in their service. It was
you and your forefathers who did this.
4 Constantly I sent all my servants the
prophets to you with this warning: Do
not do this abominable thing, which I
detest.
5 But your forefathers would not listen
or pay any heed. They did not give
up their wickedness or cease to burn
sacrifices to other gods;
6 so my anger and wrath were poured
out, and swept like fire through the
towns of Judah and the streets of
Jerusalem, until they became the
desolate ruin they are today.
7 Now these are the words of the LORD
the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: Why
bring so great a disaster on yourselves?
Why bring destruction on Judaeans, menJeremiah 44.8–12
170
and women, children and babes, and
leave yourselves without a survivor?
8 This is what comes of provoking me
by your idol-worship in burning sacrifices
to other gods in Egypt where you have
made your home. You will destroy
yourselves and become an object of
cursing and reproach among all the
nations on earth.
9 Have you forgotten the wickedness
committed by your forefathers, by the
kings of Judah and their wives, by
yourselves and your wives in the land of
Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
10 To this day no remorse has been
shown, no reverence, no obedience to
the law and the statutes which I set
before you and your forefathers.
11 These, therefore, are the words of
the LORD of Hosts the God of Israel: I
have resolved to bring disaster on you
and to exterminate all the people of
Judah.
12 I shall deal with the remnant of Judah
who decided to go to Egypt and make
their home there; in Egypt they will all
meet their end. Some will fall by the
sword, others will meet their end byJeremiah 44.13–17
171
famine. High and low alike will die by
sword or by famine and will be an object
of execration and horror, of cursing and
reproach.
13 I shall punish those who live in Egypt
as I punished those in Jerusalem, by
sword, famine, and pestilence.
14 Those who had remained in Judah
came to make their home in Egypt,
confident that they would return and live
once more in Judah. But they will not
return; not one of them will survive, not
one escape.
15 Then all the men who knew that their
wives were burning sacrifices to other
gods, and the large crowd of women
standing by, indeed all of the people
who lived in Pathros in Egypt, answered
Jeremiah:
16 We are not going to listen to what
you tell us in the name of the LORD.
17 We intend to fulfil all the vows by
which we have bound ourselves: we shall
burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven
and pour drink-offerings to her as we
used to do, we and our forefathers, our
kings and leaders, in the towns of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem. Then weJeremiah 44.18–22
172
had food in plenty and were content; no
disaster touched us.
18 But from the time we left off burning
sacrifices to the queen of heaven and
pouring drink-offerings to her, we have
been in great want, and we have fallen
victims to sword and famine.
19 The women said, All the time we
burnt sacrifices to the queen of heaven
and poured drink-offerings to her, our
husbands were fully aware that we were
making crescent-cakes marked with her
image and pouring drink-offerings to her.
20 When Jeremiah received this answer
from all the people, men and women, he
said,
21 The LORD did not forget those
sacrifices which you and your
forefathers, your kings and princes, and
the people of the land burnt in the towns
of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem,
and they mounted up in his mind
22 until he could no longer endure
them, so wicked were your deeds, so
abominable the things you did. Your land
became a desolate waste, an object of
horror and cursing, with no inhabitants,
as it still is.Jeremiah 44.23–27
173
23 The disaster you now suffer has
come on you because you burnt these
sacrifices and sinned against the LORD,
refusing to obey the LORD and conform
to his law, statutes, and teachings.
24 Further, Jeremiah said to all the
people, particularly the women: Listen
to the word of the LORD, all you from
Judah who live in Egypt.
25 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts the God of Israel: You women have
made your actions match your words.
You said, We shall carry out our vows to
burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven
and to pour drink-offerings to her. Fulfil
your vows by all means; carry them out!
26 But listen to the word of the LORD, all
you from Judah who are settled in Egypt.
I have sworn by my great name, says
the LORD, that my name will never again
be invoked by any of the Judaeans; in
Egypt they will no longer swear by the
life of the Lord GOD.
27 I am on the watch to bring you evil
and not good, and all Judaeans who are
in Egypt will meet their end by sword
and famine until not one is left.Jeremiah 44.28–45.3
174
28 It is then that any survivors of Judah
who made their home in Egypt will know
whose word prevails, mine or theirs.
29 This is the sign I give you, says the
LORD, that I intend to punish you in
this place, so that you may learn that
my threat of disaster against you will
prevail.
30 These are the words of the LORD:
I shall hand over Pharaoh Hophra king
of Egypt to his enemies and to those
who seek his life, just as I handed
over King Zedekiah of Judah to King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, his enemy
who sought his life.
1 THE word which the prophet
Jeremiah addressed to Baruch
son of Neriah when Baruch wrote these
words in a scroll at Jeremiah's dictation
in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of
Josiah, king of Judah:
2 These are the words of the LORD the
God of Israel concerning you, Baruch:
3 You said, Woe is me, for the LORD has
added grief to my trials. I have worn
myself out with my labours and have
had no respite.
45Jeremiah 45.4–46.5
175
4 This is what you shall say to Baruch:
These are the words of the LORD: What
I have built, I demolish; what I have
planted, I uproot. So it will be with the
whole earth.
5 You seek great things for yourself;
leave off seeking them. I am about to
bring disaster on all mankind, says the
LORD, but wherever you go I shall let
you escape with your life.
1 THIS came to the prophet
Jeremiah as the word of the LORD
about the nations.
2 OF Egypt: about the army of Pharaoh
Necho king of Egypt at Carchemish
on the river Euphrates, which King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon defeated
in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of
Josiah, king of Judah.
3 Hold shield and buckler ready and
advance to battle;
4 harness the horses, let the riders
mount; form up with your helmets on,
your lances burnished; on with your
coats of mail!
5 But now, what sight is this? They
are broken and routed, their warriors
defeated; they are in headlong flight
46Jeremiah 46.6–12
176
without a backward look. Terror let
loose! This is the word of the LORD.
6 Can the swiftest escape, the bravest
save himself? In the north, by the river
Euphrates, they stumble and fall.
7 Who is this rising like the Nile, like
rivers turbulent in flood?
8 It is Egypt rising like the Nile, like
rivers turbulent in flood. I shall arise
and cover the earth, says Egypt; I shall
destroy every city and its people.
9 Let the cavalry charge and the chariots
drive furiously! Let the warriors attack,
Cushites and men of Put bearing shields,
Lydians with their bows ready strung!
10 That day belongs to the Lord, the
GOD of Hosts, a day of vengeance,
vengeance on his enemies; the sword
will devour until sated, drunk with their
blood. For the GOD of Hosts, the Lord,
holds sacrifice in a northern land, by the
river Euphrates.
11 Virgin daughter of Egypt, go up into
Gilead and fetch balm. You have tried
many remedies, all in vain; no skin will
grow over your wounds.
12 The nations have heard your cry, and
the earth echoes with your screams;Jeremiah 46.13–19
177
warrior stumbles against warrior and
both fall down together.
13 The word which the LORD spoke to
the prophet Jeremiah about the advance
of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon to
harry the land of Egypt:
14 Announce it in Egypt, proclaim it
in Migdol, proclaim it in Noph and
Tahpanhes. Say: Stand to! Be ready! For
a sword devours all around you.
15 Why does Apis flee? Why does your
bull-god not stand fast? Because the
LORD has thrust him out.
16 The rabble of Egypt stumbles and
falls, man against man; each says,
Quick, back to our own people, to our
native land, far from the oppressor's
sword!
17 Give Pharaoh of Egypt the title King
Bombast, the man who missed his
opportunity.
18 By my life, one will come, says the
King whose name is the LORD of Hosts,
one mighty as Tabor among the hills, as
Carmel by the sea.
19 Get ready your baggage for exile,
you native people of Egypt; Noph will
become a waste, ruined and unpeopled.Jeremiah 46.20–26
178
20 Egypt was a lovely heifer, but a gadfly
from the north attacked her.
21 The mercenaries in her land were like
stall-fed calves; but they too turned tail
and fled, not one of them standing his
ground. The day of retribution has come
upon them, their time of reckoning.
22 Egypt is hissing like a fleeing snake,
for the enemy has come in force. They
attack her with axes like fellers of trees.
23 They cut down her forest, says the
LORD, for they cannot be numbered;
more numerous than locusts, they are
past counting.
24 The Egyptians are put to shame,
enslaved to a northern race.
25 The LORD of Hosts the God of Israel
has spoken: I am about to punish Amon
god of Thebes, Egypt with her gods and
her princes, Pharaoh and all who trust in
him.
26 I shall deliver them to those
bent on their destruction, to King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and his
troops; yet after this the land will be
peopled as of old. This is the word of the
LORD.Jeremiah 46.27–47.3
179
27 But, Jacob my servant, do not be
afraid; Israel, do not be dismayed; from
afar I shall bring you back safe, and
your children from the land where they
are captives. Jacob will be at rest once
more, secure and untroubled.
28 Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant,
says the LORD, for I am with you. I shall
make an end of all the nations amongst
whom I have dispersed you; but of you I
shall not make an end. I shall discipline
you only as you deserve, I shall not
leave you wholly unpunished.
1 This came to the prophet
Jeremiah as the word of the
LORD concerning the Philistines before
Pharaoh's attack on Gaza:
2 These are the words of the LORD: See
how waters are rising from the north and
swelling to a torrent in spate, flooding
the land and all that is in it, towns and
those who live in them. People cry out
in alarm; wailing arises from all the
inhabitants of the land.
3 At the noise of the pounding of his
chargers' hoofs, the rattle of his chariots
and their rumbling wheels, fathers have
47Jeremiah 47.4–48.2
180
no thought for their children; their hands
hang powerless,
4 because the day has come for all
Philistia to be despoiled, and Tyre and
Sidon destroyed to the last defender; for
the LORD is despoiling the Philistines,
that remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
5 Gaza is shorn bare, Ashkelon ruined,
the remnant of the Philistine power. How
long will you gash yourselves and cry:
6 Ah, sword in the hand of the LORD,
how long will it be before you rest?
Sheathe yourself, cease and be quiet.
7 How can it rest when the LORD has
given it work to do against Ashkelon and
the sea coast? There he has assigned
the sword its task.
1 Of Moab. This is what the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel says:
Woe betide Nebo! It is laid waste;
Kiriathaim captured and put to shame,
Misgab reduced to shame and dismay;
2 Moab's glory is no more. In Heshbon
they plot her downfall: Come, put an end
to that nation. And you, the inhabitants
of Madhmen, will also perish, pursued by
the sword.
48Jeremiah 48.3–11
181
3 Cries of anguish arise from Horonaim:
Havoc and utter destruction!
4 Moab is broken; their cries are heard
as far as Zoar.
5 On the ascent to Luhith they go
up weeping bitterly; on the descent
to Horonaim an anguished cry of
destruction is heard.
6 Flee, escape with your lives and
become like one destitute in the
wilderness.
7 Because you trust in your defences
and arsenals, you too will be captured,
and Kemosh will go into exile, his priests
and those in attendance with him.
8 A despoiler will come against every
town; no town will escape, valley
and tableland will be laid waste and
plundered; the LORD has spoken.
9 Give a warning signal to Moab, for she
will be laid in ruins; and her towns will
become waste places with no inhabitant
in them.
10 A curse on all who are slack in doing
the LORD's work! A curse on all who
withhold their swords from bloodshed!
11 From its earliest days Moab has been
undisturbed and never gone into exile.Jeremiah 48.12–18
182
It has been like wine settled on its lees,
not decanted from vessel to vessel; its
flavour remains unaltered and its aroma
stays unchanged.
12 Therefore the days are coming, says
the LORD, when I shall send men to tilt
the jars; they will empty the vessels and
smash the jars.
13 Moab will be let down by Kemosh as
Israel was let down by Bethel, a god in
whom they trusted.
14 How can you say, We are warriors,
men valiant in battle?
15 The spoiler of Moab and its towns has
launched an attack, and the flower of its
youth goes down to be slaughtered. This
is the word of the King whose name is
the LORD of Hosts.
16 Retribution on Moab is near at hand,
disaster rushing swiftly on him.
17 Bewail him, all you his neighbours
and all who knew his fame; and say,
Alas! The commander's staff is broken,
that splendid baton.
18 Come down from your place of
honour, sit on the parched ground, you
natives of Dibon; for the spoiler of MoabJeremiah 48.19–28
183
has come against you and destroyed
your citadels.
19 You that live in Aroer, stand by the
road and watch, ask the man running
away, the woman escaping, ask, What
has happened?
20 Moab is reduced to shame and
dismay: wail and cry, proclaim by the
Arnon that Moab is despoiled.
21 Judgement has come to the tableland,
to Holon and Jahaz, Mephaath
22 and Dibon, Nebo and Beth-diblathaim
23 and Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul,
Beth-meon,
24 Kerioth and Bozrah, and to all the
towns of Moab far and near.
25 Moab's horn is hacked off and his
strong arm is broken, says the LORD.
26 Make Moab drunk -- he has defied the
LORD. Let Moab overflow with his vomit
and become in turn a butt for derision.
27 Was not Israel your butt? Yet was he
ever in company with thieves, that each
time you spoke of him you shook your
head?
28 Leave your towns, you inhabitants of
Moab, and find a home among the crags;Jeremiah 48.29–35
184
become like a dove which nests in the
rock-face at the mouth of a cavern.
29 We have heard of Moab's pride,
and proud indeed he is, proud,
presumptuous, overbearing, insolent.
30 I know his arrogance, says the LORD;
his boasting is false, false are his deeds.
31 Therefore I shall wail over Moab, cry
in anguish for the whole of Moab; I shall
moan over the men of Kir-heres.
32 More than I wept for Jazer I shall
weep for you, vine of Sibmah, whose
branches spread out to the sea and
reach as far as Jazer. The despoiler has
fallen on your harvest and vintage;
33 gladness and joy are taken away
from the garden land of Moab; I have
dried up the flow of wine from the vats,
and the shouts of those treading the
grapes will echo no more.
34 Heshbon and Elealeh utter cries of
anguish which are heard in Jahaz; the
sound carries from Zoar to Horonaim
and Eglath-shelishiyah; for the waters of
Nimrim have become a desolate waste.
35 In Moab I shall put an end to their
sacrificing at shrines and burning of
offerings to their gods, says the LORD.Jeremiah 48.36–43
185
36 Therefore I wail for Moab like a
reed-pipe, wail like a reed-pipe for the
men of Kir-heres. Their accumulated
wealth has vanished.
37 Every man's head is shorn in
mourning, every beard clipped, every
hand gashed, and every waist girded
with sackcloth.
38 On all Moab's roofs and in all her
broad streets nothing is heard but
lamentation, for I have broken Moab like
an unwanted pot, says the LORD.
39 Moab is dismayed and has turned
away in shame. It has become a butt
of derision and a cause of dismay to all
round about.
40 For the LORD has spoken: Like an
eagle with outspread wings he swoops
down on Moab.
41 Towns are captured, the strongholds
taken; on that day the spirit of Moab's
warriors will fail like the spirit of a
woman in labour.
42 The Moabite nation will be destroyed,
for it vaunted itself against the LORD.
43 The hunter's scare, the pit, and the
trap threaten you dwellers in Moab, says
the LORD.Jeremiah 48.44–49.2
186
44 If anyone runs from the scare he will
fall into the pit; if someone climbs out of
the pit he will be caught in the trap. All
this I shall bring on Moab in the year of
their reckoning. This is the word of the
LORD.
45 In the shadow of Heshbon the
fugitives stand helpless; for fire has
blazed out from Heshbon, flames from
within Sihon devouring the braggarts of
Moab, both forehead and crown.
46 Woe betide you, Moab! The people
of Kemosh have vanished, for your sons
are taken into captivity, your daughters
led away captive.
47 Yet in days to come I shall restore
Moab's fortunes. This is the word of
the LORD. Here ends the judgement on
Moab.
1 Of the Ammonites. Thus says
the LORD: Has Israel no sons?
Has he no heir? Why then has Milcom
inherited the land of Gad, and why do
Milcom's people live in its towns?
2 Therefore a time is coming, says the
LORD, when I shall make Rabbah of the
Ammonites hear the battle cry, when
it will become a desolate mound and
49Jeremiah 49.3–7
187
its villages will be burnt to ashes; then
Israel will disinherit all who disinherited
them, says the LORD.
3 Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is despoiled;
cry aloud, you villages round Rabbah!
Put on sackcloth and beat your breast,
and score your bodies with gashes, for
Milcom will go into exile, and with him
his priests and attendants.
4 Why do you glory in your strength,
you wayward people who trust in your
arsenals and say, Who will dare attack
me?
5 Beware, I am bringing terror on you
from every side, says the Lord GOD
of Hosts; every one of you will be
driven headlong with no one to rally the
fugitives.
6 Yet after this I shall restore the
fortunes of Ammon. This is the word of
the LORD.
7 Of Edom. The LORD of Hosts has
said: Is wisdom no longer to be found
in Teman? Have her wise men lost all
skill in counsel? Has their wisdom been
dispersed abroad?Jeremiah 49.8–13
188
8 Turn and flee, people of Dedan, take
refuge in remote places; for I shall bring
retribution on Esau, his day of reckoning.
9 If vintagers were to come to you they
would surely leave gleanings; and if
thieves were to raid your crops by night,
they would take only enough for their
needs.
10 But I have ransacked Esau's treasure,
I have uncovered his hiding-places, and
he has nowhere to conceal himself. His
children, his kinsfolk, and his neighbours
are despoiled; there is no one to deliver
him.
11 Am I to keep alive your fatherless
children? Are your widows to depend on
me?
12 For these are the words of the LORD:
Those who were not doomed to drink
the cup must drink it none the less; are
you alone to go unpunished? You will not
escape; you will have to drink it.
13 For by my life, says the LORD,
Bozrah will become an object of horror
and reproach, a desolation and a thing
of cursing; and all her towns will be
desolate for ever.Jeremiah 49.14–19
189
14 When a herald was sent among
the nations crying, Gather and march
against her, prepare for battle, I heard
this message from the LORD:
15 Look, I make you the least of all
nations, most despised of people.
16 Your overbearing arrogance and your
insolent heart have led you astray. You,
whose haunts are in the crannies of the
rock, you keep your hold on the hilltop.
Though you nest as high as an eagle,
even from there I shall bring you down.
This is the word of the LORD.
17 Edom will become an object of
horror, all who pass that way will be
horror-struck, astounded at the sight of
all her wounds,
18 overthrown as she is like Sodom and
Gomorrah and their neighbours, says the
LORD. No one will live there, no human
being will make a home in her.
19 Like a lion coming up from Jordan's
dense thickets to the perennial pastures,
in a moment I shall chase the shepherd
away and round up the choicest of the
rams. For who is like me? Who can
arraign me? What shepherd can stand
his ground before me?Jeremiah 49.20–26
190
20 Therefore listen to the LORD's
purpose against Edom and his plans
against the people of Teman: The young
of the flock will be dragged off, and their
pasture will be aghast at their fate.
21 At the sound of their downfall the
land quakes; it cries out, and the sound
is heard at the Red Sea.
22 Like an eagle with outspread wings
he will soar and swoop down against
Bozrah, and on that day the spirit of
Edom's warriors will be like the spirit of
a woman in labour.
23 Of Damascus. Hamath and Arpad are
covered with confusion, for they have
heard news of disaster; they are tossed
up and down in anxiety like the unresting
sea.
24 Damascus has lost heart and turns to
flight; trembling has seized her, pangs
like childbirth have gripped her.
25 How forlorn is the town of joyful
song, the place of gladness!
26 Therefore her young men will fall in
her streets and all her warriors lie still in
death that day. This is the word of the
LORD of Hosts.Jeremiah 49.27–32
191
27 Then I shall kindle a fire within the
wall of Damascus and it will devour
Ben-hadad's palaces.
28 Of Kedar and the kingdoms of
Hazor which King Nebuchadrezzar of
Babylon subdued. The LORD has said:
Come, attack Kedar, despoil the eastern
desert-dwellers.
29 Carry away their tents and their
flocks, the curtains of their tents and all
their goods, and drive off their camels. A
cry will go up: Terror let loose!
30 Flee and make your escape, take
refuge in remote places, you people
of Hazor, says the LORD; for King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon has laid his
plans, he has formed a design against
you:
31 Come, let us attack a nation at peace,
living in fancied security with no barred
gates, dwelling in isolation.
32 Their camels will be carried off as
booty, their vast herds of cattle as
plunder; I shall scatter them to all
the winds to roam the fringes of the
desert, and from every side I shall bring
retribution on them, says the LORD.Jeremiah 49.33–39
192
33 Hazor will become a haunt of wolves,
for ever desolate, where no one will live,
no mortal make a home. This is the word
of the LORD.
34 This came to the prophet Jeremiah as
the word of the LORD concerning Elam,
at the beginning of the reign of King
Zedekiah of Judah:
35 Thus says the LORD of Hosts: I shall
break the bow of Elam, the chief weapon
of their might;
36 I shall bring four winds against Elam
from the four quarters of heaven; I
shall scatter them to all these winds,
and there will be no nation to which the
exiles from Elam do not go.
37 I shall break Elam before their foes,
before those who are bent on their
destruction; I shall vent my fierce anger
upon them in disaster; I shall pursue
them with the sword until I make an end
of them, says the LORD.
38 Then I shall set my throne in Elam,
and destroy the king and his officers
there. This is the word of the LORD.
39 Yet in days to come I shall restore
the fortunes of Elam. This is the word of
the LORD.Jeremiah 50.1–6
193
1 The word which the LORD
50 spoke about Babylon, the land of
the Chaldaeans, through the prophet
Jeremiah:
2 Declare among the nations, make
proclamation; keep nothing back, spread
the news: Babylon is taken, Bel put to
shame, Marduk dismayed; the idols of
Babylon are put to shame, her false gods
are dismayed.
3 A nation has come out of the north
against her; it will make her land a
desolate waste with no one living there;
man and beast have fled and are gone.
4 In those days and at that time, says
the LORD, the people of Israel and the
people of Judah will come together, and
in tears go in search of the LORD their
God;
5 they will ask the way to Zion, turning
their faces towards her, and saying,
Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD
in an everlasting covenant which will
never be forgotten.
6 My people were lost sheep, whose
shepherds let them stray and run wild
on the mountains; they wandered from
mountain to hill, forgetful of their fold.Jeremiah 50.7–12
194
7 All who came on them devoured them;
their enemies said, We incur no guilt,
because they have sinned against the
LORD, the LORD who is the true goal and
the hope of their forefathers.
8 Flee from Babylon, from the land of
the Chaldaeans; go out like he-goats
leading the flock.
9 I shall stir up a host of mighty
nations and bring them against Babylon,
marshalled against her from a northern
land; and from the north she will be
captured. Their arrows are like those
of a skilled warrior who never returns
empty-handed;
10 the Chaldaeans will be plundered,
and all who plunder them will take their
fill. This is the word of the LORD.
11 You plundered my possession; but
though you rejoice and exult, though
you run free like a heifer during the
threshing, though you neigh like a
stallion,
12 your mother will be cruelly disgraced,
she who bore you will be put to shame.
Look at her, bringing up the rear of
the nations, a wilderness, parched and
barren,Jeremiah 50.13–18
195
13 uninhabited through the wrath of
the LORD, an object of horror; all who
pass by Babylon will be horror-struck
and astounded at the sight of her many
wounds.
14 Marshal your forces and encircle
Babylon, you whose bows are ready
strung; shoot at her, spare not your
arrows, for she has sinned against the
LORD.
15 On every side shout in triumph over
her; she has surrendered, her bastions
are thrown down, her walls demolished.
This is the vengeance of the LORD; be
avenged on her; as she has done, so do
to her.
16 Destroy every sower in Babylon,
every reaper with his sickle at harvest
time. To escape the cruel sword everyone
will turn back to his people, everyone
flee to his own land.
17 Israel is a scattered flock harried and
chased by lions: the Assyrian king was
the first to devour him, and now at the
last his bones have been gnawed by King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.
18 Therefore the LORD of Hosts the God
of Israel says this: I shall punish theJeremiah 50.19–24
196
king of Babylon and his country as once
I punished the king of Assyria.
19 But I shall bring Israel back to his
own pasture, to graze on Carmel and
Bashan; on Ephraim's hills and in Gilead
he will eat his fill.
20 In those days, says the LORD, when
that time comes, search will be made for
the iniquity of Israel, but there will be
none, and for the sin of Judah, but it will
not be found; for those whom I leave as
a remnant I shall pardon.
21 Attack the land of Merathaim; attack
it and the inhabitants of Pekod; put them
to the sword and utterly destroy them,
and do whatever I command you. This is
the word of the LORD.
22 The sound of war is heard in the land
and great destruction!
23 See how the hammer of the whole
world is hacked and broken, how Babylon
has become a thing of horror among the
nations!
24 Babylon, you have set a snare
for yourself and have been trapped
unawares. There you are, you are
caught, because you have challenged
the LORD.Jeremiah 50.25–30
197
25 The LORD has opened his armoury
and brought out the weapons of his
wrath; for this is work for the Lord the
GOD of Hosts to do in the land of the
Chaldaeans.
26 Come against her from every quarter;
throw open her granaries, pile her like
heaps of grain; destroy her completely,
let no survivor be left.
27 Put all her warriors to the sword; let
them be led to the slaughter. Woe betide
them, for their time has come, their day
of reckoning!
28 I hear the fugitives escaping from
the land of Babylon to proclaim in Zion
the vengeance of the LORD our God, the
vengeance he takes for his temple.
29 Let your arrows whistle against
Babylon, all you whose bows are ready
strung. Besiege her on all sides; let no
one escape. Repay her in full for her
misdeeds; as she has done, so do to her,
for she has insulted the LORD the Holy
One of Israel.
30 Therefore her young men will fall in
her streets, and all her warriors lie still
in death that day. This is the word of the
LORD.Jeremiah 50.31–37
198
31 I am against you, insolent city;
for your time has come, your day of
reckoning. This is the word of the Lord
GOD of Hosts.
32 The insolent one will stumble and
fall and no one will lift her up; I shall
kindle fire in her towns and it will devour
everything round about.
33 The LORD of Hosts has said this: The
peoples of Israel and Judah are both
oppressed; their captors all hold them
fast and will not let go.
34 But they have a powerful advocate,
whose name is the LORD of Hosts; he
himself will take up their cause, that he
may give distress to the land and turmoil
to the inhabitants of Babylon.
35 A sword hangs over the Chaldaeans,
over the people of Babylon, her officers
and wise men, says the LORD.
36 A sword hangs over the false
prophets, and they are made fools,
a sword over her warriors, and they
despair,
37 a sword over her horses and her
chariots and over all the mixed rabble
within her, and they will become likeJeremiah 50.38–43
199
women; a sword over her treasures, and
they will be plundered,
38 a sword over her waters, and they
will dry up; for it is a land of idols that
glories in its dreaded gods.
39 Therefore marmots and jackals will
skulk in it, desert-owls will haunt it;
never more will it be inhabited and age
after age no one will dwell in it.
40 It will be as when God overthrew
Sodom and Gomorrah along with their
neighbours, says the LORD; no one will
live in it, no human being will make a
home there.
41 See, an army is coming from the
north; a great nation and mighty kings
rouse themselves from earth's farthest
corners.
42 Armed with bow and scimitar, they
are cruel and pitiless; bestriding their
horses, they sound like the thunder of
the sea; they are like men arrayed for
battle against you, Babylon.
43 News of them has reached the king
of Babylon, and his hands hang limp;
agony grips him, pangs as of a woman
in labour.Jeremiah 50.44–51.3
200
44 Like a lion coming up from Jordan's
dense thickets to the perennial pastures,
in a moment I shall chase the shepherd
away and round up the choicest of the
rams. For who is like me? Who can
challenge me? What shepherd can stand
his ground before me?
45 Therefore listen to the LORD's
purpose against Babylon and his plans
against the land of the Chaldaeans: The
young of the flock will be dragged off,
and their pasture will be aghast at their
fate.
46 At the sound of Babylon's capture the
land quakes; it cries out, and the sound
is heard throughout the nations.
1 For thus says the LORD: I
shall raise a destructive wind
against Babylon and the inhabitants of
Leb-kamai.
2 I shall send winnowers to Babylon who
will winnow her land empty; for they will
assail her from all sides on the day of
disaster.
3 How will the archer then string his bow
or put on his coat of mail? Spare none of
her young men, but utterly destroy her
whole army
51Jeremiah 51.4–11
201
4 and let them fall dead in the land of
the Chaldaeans, slain in her streets.
5 Israel and Judah are not left widowed
by their God, by the LORD of Hosts; but
their land is full of guilt, condemned by
the Holy One of Israel.
6 Flee out of Babylon, each one for
himself, or you will perish for her sin; for
this is the LORD's day of vengeance, and
he is paying her full recompense.
7 Babylon has been a golden cup in
the LORD's hand to make all the earth
drunk; the nations have drunk of her
wine, and that has made them mad.
8 Suddenly Babylon falls and is broken.
Wail for her! Fetch balm for her wound;
perhaps she may be healed.
9 We tried to heal Babylon, but she is
past healing. Leave her and let us be off,
each to his own country; for her doom
reaches to heaven and mounts up to the
skies.
10 The LORD has made our victory plain
to see; come, let us proclaim in Zion
what the LORD our God has done.
11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers.
The LORD has roused the spirit of the
king of the Medes; for the LORD'sJeremiah 51.12–17
202
purpose against Babylon is to destroy it,
and his vengeance is vengeance for his
temple.
12 Raise the standard against Babylon's
walls, mount a strong blockade, post
sentries, set an ambush; for the LORD
has both planned and carried out
his threat against the inhabitants of
Babylon.
13 You opulent city, standing beside
great waters, your end has come, your
destiny is certain.
14 The LORD of Hosts has sworn by
himself: Surely I shall fill you with
enemies who will swarm like locusts, and
they will raise a shout of triumph over
you.
15 God made the earth by his power,
fixed the world in place by his wisdom,
and by his knowledge unfurled the skies.
16 When he speaks in the thunder the
waters in the heavens are in tumult; he
brings up the mist from the ends of the
earth, he opens rifts for the rain, and
brings the wind out of his storehouses.
17 Everyone is brutish and ignorant,
every goldsmith is discredited throughJeremiah 51.18–24
203
his idols; for the figures he casts are a
sham, there is no breath in them.
18 They are worthless, mere objects of
mockery, which perish when their day of
reckoning comes.
19 Jacob's chosen God is not like these,
for he is the creator of the universe.
Israel is the people he claims as his own;
the LORD of Hosts is his name.
20 You are my battleaxe, my weapon
of war; with you I shall break nations
in pieces, and with you I shall destroy
kingdoms.
21 With you I shall break horse and
rider, with you I shall break chariot and
charioteer,
22 with you I shall break man and wife,
with you I shall break old and young,
with you I shall break youth and maiden,
23 with you I shall break shepherd
and his flock, with you I shall break
ploughman and his team, with you I
shall break viceroys and governors.
24 So shall I repay Babylon and the
people of Chaldaea for all the wrong
which they did in Zion in your sight. This
is the word of the LORD.Jeremiah 51.25–30
204
25 I am against you, a destructive
mountain destroying the whole earth,
says the LORD. I shall stretch out my
hand against you and send you tumbling
headlong from the rocks and make you
a burnt-out mountain.
26 No stone taken from you will be
used as a corner-stone, no stone for
a foundation; but you will be for ever
desolate. This is the word of the LORD.
27 Raise a standard on the earth, blow a
trumpet among the nations, consecrate
the nations for war against her, summon
the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and
Ashkenaz, appoint a commander against
her, bring up horses like a dark swarm of
locusts.
28 For war against her consecrate the
nations, the king of the Medes, his
viceroys and governors, and all the lands
under his sway.
29 The earth quakes and writhes; for
the LORD's designs against Babylon are
fulfilled: to make the land of Babylon an
unpeopled waste.
30 Babylon's warriors have given up
the fight; they skulk in the forts, their
courage has failed, they have becomeJeremiah 51.31–36
205
like women. The buildings are set on
fire, the bars of the gates broken.
31 Runner speeds to meet runner,
messenger to meet messenger, reporting
to the king of Babylon that every quarter
of his city is taken,
32 the river-crossings are seized, the
guard-towers set on fire, and the
garrison stricken with panic.
33 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts the God of Israel: Babylon is
like a threshing-floor when it is trodden;
very soon harvest time will come for her.
34 King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon has
devoured me and sucked me dry; he
has set me aside like an empty jar. Like
a dragon he has gulped me down; he
filled his maw with my delicate flesh and
spewed me up.
35 Every citizen of Zion will say, On
Babylon be the violence done to me, the
vengeance taken on me! Jerusalem will
say, My blood be on the Chaldaeans!
36 Therefore the LORD says: I shall
plead your cause, I shall avenge you;
I shall dry up her river and make her
waters fail.Jeremiah 51.37–44
206
37 Babylon will become a heap of ruins,
a haunt of wolves, an object of horror
and astonishment, with no inhabitant.
38 Together they roar like young lions,
they growl like the whelps of a lioness.
39 I shall cause their drinking bouts to
end in fever and make them so drunk
that they will writhe and toss, then
sink into unending sleep, never to wake
again. This is the word of the LORD.
40 I shall bring them down like lambs
to the slaughter, like rams and he-goats
together.
41 Sheshak is captured, the pride of the
whole world taken. How Babylon has
become a thing of horror among the
nations!
42 The sea has surged over Babylon,
she is covered by its roaring waves.
43 Her towns have become waste places,
a land parched and barren, a land where
no one lives, through which no human
being travels.
44 I shall punish Bel in Babylon and
make him disgorge what he has
swallowed; nations will never again
come streaming to him. Babylon's wall
has fallen.Jeremiah 51.45–51
207
45 My people, come out from her, and
let every one save himself from the
fierce anger of the LORD.
46 Then beware of losing heart; fear
no rumours spread abroad in the land,
as rumour follows rumour, a new one
every year: of violence on earth, of ruler
against ruler.
47 Therefore a time is coming when I
shall punish Babylon's idols; her whole
land will be put to shame, and all her
slain will lie fallen in her midst.
48 The heavens and the earth and all
that is in them will sing in triumph over
Babylon; for marauders from the north
will overrun her. This is the word of the
LORD.
49 Babylon in her turn must fall because
of Israel's slain, as the slain of all the
world have fallen because of Babylon.
50 You that have escaped the sword, go,
do not linger. Remember the LORD from
afar and let Jerusalem come to your
minds.
51 By the reproaches we have heard
we are put to shame and our faces
are covered with confusion, becauseJeremiah 51.52–57
208
foreigners have entered the sacred
courts of the LORD's house.
52 A time is coming therefore, says the
LORD, when I shall punish her idols, and
throughout her land the wounded will
groan.
53 Were Babylon to reach the skies and
make strong her towers in the heights, I
should still send marauders against her.
This is the word of the LORD.
54 Cries of agony are heard from
Babylon, sounds of great destruction
from Chaldaea.
55 The advancing wave booms and roars
like mighty waters, for the LORD is
despoiling Babylon and will silence the
noise of the city.
56 Marauders march on Babylon herself,
her warriors are captured and their
bows broken; for the LORD, a God of
retribution, will repay in full.
57 I shall make her princes and her wise
men drunk, her viceroys and governors
and warriors, and they will sink into
unending sleep, never to wake again.
This is the word of the King, whose name
is the LORD of Hosts.Jeremiah 51.58–64
209
58 The LORD of Hosts says: The walls
of broad Babylon will be razed to the
ground, her lofty gates set on fire.
Worthless now is the thing for which
peoples toiled; nations wore themselves
out for a mere nothing.
59 The instructions given by the prophet
Jeremiah to the quartermaster Seraiah
son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah,
when he went to Babylon with King
Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year of
his reign.
60 Jeremiah, having written on a scroll
a full description of the disaster which
would befall Babylon,
61 said to Seraiah, When you come to
Babylon, see that you read all these
words aloud;
62 then say, LORD, you have declared
your purpose to destroy this place and
leave it with nothing living in it, man or
beast; it will be desolate, for ever waste.
63 When you have finished reading the
scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into
the middle of the Euphrates
64 with the words, So will Babylon sink,
never to rise again after the disasterJeremiah 52.1–7
210
which I am going to bring on her. Thus
far are the collected sayings of Jeremiah.
1 ZEDEKIAH was twenty-one
years old when he came to the
throne, and he reigned in Jerusalem for
eleven years; his mother was Hamutal
daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
2 Zedekiah did what was wrong in the
eyes of the LORD, as Jehoiakim had
done.
3 Jerusalem and Judah so angered the
LORD that in the end he banished them
from his sight. Zedekiah rebelled against
the king of Babylon.
4 In the ninth year of his reign, on
the tenth day of the tenth month, King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon advanced
with his whole army against Jerusalem,
invested it, and erected siege-towers
against it on every side;
5 the siege lasted till the eleventh year
of King Zedekiah.
6 In the fourth month of that year, on
the ninth day of the month, while famine
raged in the city and there was no food
for the people,
7 the city capitulated. When King
Zedekiah of Judah saw this, he and all
52Jeremiah 52.8–12
211
his armed escort left the city by night
and, fleeing through the gate called
Between the Two Walls near the king's
garden, they made their way towards
the Arabah, although the Chaldaeans
were surrounding the city.
8 The Chaldaean soldiers set off in
pursuit and overtook King Zedekiah in
the lowlands of Jericho; his men had all
abandoned him and scattered.
9 Zedekiah, when captured, was brought
before the king of Babylon at Riblah in
the territory of Hamath, where sentence
was passed on him.
10 The king of Babylon had Zedekiah's
sons slain before his eyes; he also put to
death all the princes of Judah at Riblah.
11 Then Zedekiah's eyes were blinded,
and the king of Babylon bound him
with bronze fetters and brought him to
Babylon, where he committed him to
prison till the day of his death.
12 On the tenth day of the fifth
month, in the nineteenth year of
King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon,
Nebuzaradan, captain of the king
of Babylon's bodyguard, came to
Jerusalem,Jeremiah 52.13–19
212
13 and set fire to the house of the
LORD and the royal palace, indeed all
the houses in the city; every notable
person's house was burnt down.
14 The whole Chaldaean force under the
captain of the guard pulled down all the
walls encircling Jerusalem.
15 Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard,
deported the rest of the people left in the
city, those who had defected to the king
of Babylon, and the remaining artisans.
16 He left behind only the poorest
class of people, to be vine-dressers and
labourers.
17 The Chaldaeans broke up the bronze
pillars in the house of the LORD, the
trolleys, and the bronze Sea, and carried
off all the metal to Babylon.
18 They removed also the pots, shovels,
snuffers, tossing-bowls, saucers, and all
the bronze vessels used in the service of
the temple.
19 The captain of the guard took away
the precious metal, whether gold or
silver, of which the cups, firepans,
tossing-bowls, pots, lampstands,
saucers, and flagons were made.Jeremiah 52.20–25
213
20 The bronze of the two pillars, of
the one Sea, and of the twelve oxen
supporting it, which King Solomon had
made for the house of the LORD, was
beyond weighing.
21 One pillar was eighteen cubits high
and twelve cubits in circumference;
it was hollow, but the metal was four
fingers thick.
22 It had a capital of bronze, five cubits
high, and a decoration of network and
pomegranates ran all round it, wholly
of bronze. The other pillar, with its
pomegranates, was exactly like it.
23 Ninety-six pomegranates were
exposed to view and there were a
hundred in all on the network all round.
24 The captain of the guard took Seraiah
the chief priest, Zephaniah the deputy
chief priest, and the three on duty at the
entrance;
25 he took also from the city a eunuch
who was in charge of the fighting men,
seven of those with right of access to
the king who were still in the city, the
adjutant-general whose duty was to
muster the army for war, and sixty men
of the people who were still there.Jeremiah 52.26–32
214
26 These Nebuzaradan, captain of the
guard, brought to the king of Babylon at
Riblah.
27 There, in the land of Hamath, the
king had them flogged and put to death.
So Judah went into exile from its own
land.
28 These were the people deported
by Nebuchadrezzar in the seventh
year of his reign: three thousand and
twenty-three Judaeans.
29 In the eighteenth year, eight hundred
and thirty-two people from Jerusalem;
30 in the twenty-third year, seven
hundred and forty-five Judaeans were
deported by Nebuzaradan the captain of
the bodyguard: in all four thousand six
hundred people.
31 In the thirty-seventh year of the
exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the
twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month,
King Evil-merodach of Babylon in the
year of his accession showed favour to
King Jehoiachin of Judah. He released
him from prison,
32 treated him kindly, and gave him a
seat at table above the kings with him in
Babylon.Jeremiah 52.33–34
215
33 Jehoiachin, discarding his prison
clothes, lived as a pensioner of the king
for the rest of his life.
34 For his maintenance a regular daily
allowance was given him by the king of
Babylon to the day of his death.Lamentations
1 HOW DESERTED lies the city, once
1 thronging with people! Once great
among nations, now become a widow;
once queen among provinces, now put
to forced labour!
2 She weeps bitterly in the night; tears
run down her cheeks. Among all who
loved her she has no one to bring her
comfort. Her friends have all betrayed
her; they have become her enemies.
3 Judah has wasted away through
affliction and endless servitude. Living
among the nations, she has found no
resting-place; her persecutors all fell on
her in her sore distress.
4 The approaches to Zion mourn, for no
pilgrims attend her sacred feasts; all her
gates are desolate. Her priests groan,
her maidens are made to suffer. How
bitter is her fate!
5 Her adversaries have become her
masters, her enemies take their ease, for
the LORD has made her suffer becauseLamentations 1.6–10
2
of her countless sins. Her young children
are gone, taken captive by an adversary.
6 All splendour has vanished from the
daughter of Zion. Her princes have
become like deer that can find no
pasture. They run on, their strength
spent, pursued by the hunter.
7 In the days of Jerusalem's misery and
restlessness she called to mind all the
treasures which were hers from days of
old, when her people fell into the power
of adversaries and she had no one to
help her. The adversaries looked on,
laughing at her downfall.
8 Jerusalem, greatly sinning, was
treated like a filthy rag. All who had
honoured her held her cheap, now they
had seen her nakedness. What could she
do but groan and turn away?
9 Uncleanness afflicted her body, and
she gave no thought to her fate. Her
fall was beyond belief and there was no
one to comfort her. Look, LORD, on my
misery, for the enemy has triumphed.
10 The adversary stretched out his
hand to seize all her treasures. Indeed
she saw Gentiles invade her sanctuary,Lamentations 1.11– 15
3
Gentiles forbidden by you to enter the
assembly, for it was yours.
11 All her people groaned, they begged
for bread; they bartered their treasures
for food to regain their strength.
Look, LORD, and see how cheap I am
accounted.
12 Is it nothing to you, you passers-by?
If only you would look and see: is there
any agony like mine, like these torments
which the LORD made me suffer on the
day of his fierce anger?
13 From heaven he sent down fire,
which ran through my bones; he spread
out a net to catch my feet, and turned
me back; he made me an example of
desolation, racked with sickness all day
long.
14 My sins were bound like a yoke tied
fast by his own hand; set upon my neck,
it caused my strength to fail. The LORD
abandoned me to my sins, and in their
grip I could not stand.
15 The Lord treated with scorn all
the mighty men within my walls; he
marshalled rank on rank against me to
crush my young warriors. The Lord trodLamentations 1.16– 20

down, like grapes in the winepress, the
virgin daughter of Judah.
16 This is why I weep over my plight,
why tears stream from my eyes: because
any who might comfort me and renew
my strength are far away from me; my
children have become desolate, for the
enemy is victorious.
17 Zion lifted her hands in prayer,
but there was no one to comfort her;
the LORD ordered Jacob's enemies to
beset him on every side. In their midst
Jerusalem became an unclean thing to
be shunned.
18 The LORD was in the right, for I
rebelled against his command. Listen, all
you nations, and look on my agony: my
maidens and my young men are gone
into captivity.
19 I called to my lovers, but they let
me down; my priests and my elders
perished in the city while seeking food to
keep themselves alive.
20 LORD, see how sorely distressed I
am. My bowels writhe in anguish and
my heart within me turns over, because
I wantonly rebelled. In the street theLamentations 1.21–2.3

sword brings bereavement, like the
plague within the house.
21 People have heard when I groan with
no one to comfort me. My enemies,
hearing of my plight, all rejoiced at what
you had done. Hasten the day you have
promised when they will suffer as I do!
22 Let all their evil deeds come before
you; torment them in their turn, as you
have tormented me on account of all my
sins; for I groan continually and I am
sick at heart.
1 WHAT darkness the Lord in his
anger has brought on the daughter
of Zion! He hurled down from heaven to
earth the honour of Israel, with scant
regard for Zion his footstool on the day
of his anger.
2 The Lord overwhelmed without pity
all the dwellings of Jacob. In his wrath
he overthrew the strongholds of the
daughter of Judah; he brought to the
ground in dishonour the kingdom and its
rulers.
3 In his fierce anger he hacked off the
horn of Israel's pride; he withdrew his
protecting hand at the approach of the
2Lamentations 2.4– 8
6
enemy; he blazed in Jacob like flaming
fire that rages far and wide.
4 In enmity he bent his bow; like an
adversary he took his stand, and with
his strong arm he slew all those who had
been his delight. He poured out his fury
like fire on the tent of the daughter of
Zion.
5 The Lord played an enemy's part
and overwhelmed Israel, overthrowing
all their mansions and laying their
strongholds in ruins. To the daughter of
Judah he brought unending sorrow.
6 He stripped his tabernacle as if it
were a garden, and made the place
of assembly a ruin. In Zion the LORD
blotted out all memory of festal assembly
and of sabbath; king and priest alike he
spurned in the heat of his anger.
7 The Lord rejected his own altar and
abandoned his sanctuary. The walls of
Zion's mansions he delivered into the
power of the enemy; in the LORD's
house they raised shouts as on a festal
day.
8 The LORD was resolved to destroy the
wall of the daughter of Zion; he took
its measure with his line and did notLamentations 2.9–13
7
scruple to demolish it. He made rampart
and wall lament, and both together lay
dejected.
9 He has shattered the bars of her gates,
and the gates themselves have sunk
into the ground. Her king and rulers are
exiled among the Gentiles; there is no
direction from priests, and her prophets
have received no vision from the LORD.
10 The elders of Zion sit on the ground
in silence; they have cast dust on their
heads and put on sackcloth. The maidens
of Jerusalem bow their heads to the
ground.
11 My eyes are blinded with tears,
my bowels writhe in anguish. My bile
is spilt on the earth because of my
people's wound, as children and infants
lie fainting in the streets of the city.
12 They cry to their mothers, Where is
there bread and wine? -- as they faint
like wounded things in the streets of
the city, gasping out their lives in their
mothers' bosoms.
13 How can I cheer you? Whose plight
is like yours, daughter of Jerusalem?
To what can I compare you for your
comfort, virgin daughter of Zion? ForLamentations 2.14– 18
8
your wound gapes as wide as the ocean
-- who can heal you?
14 The visions that your prophets saw
for you were a false and painted sham.
They did not bring home to you your
guilt so as to reverse your fortunes. The
visions they saw for you were delusions,
false and fraudulent.
15 All those who pass by snap their
fingers at you; they hiss and wag their
heads at the daughter of Jerusalem,
saying, Is this the city once called perfect
in beauty, the joy of the whole earth?
16 All your enemies jeer at you with
open mouths; they hiss and grind their
teeth, saying, Here we are, this is the
day we have waited for; we have lived to
see it.
17 The LORD has done what he planned
to do, he has fulfilled his threat, all
that he decreed from days of old. He
has demolished without pity and let
the enemy rejoice over you, filling your
adversaries with pride.

wall of the daughter of Zion; let your
tears run down like a torrent day andLamentations 2.19– 22

night. Give yourself not a moment's rest,
let your tears never cease.
19 Arise, cry aloud in the night; at the
beginning of every watch pour out your
heart like water before the presence
of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him
for the lives of your children, who are
fainting with hunger at every street
corner.
20 LORD, look and see: who is it you
have thus tormented? Must women eat
the fruit of their wombs, the children
they have held in their arms? Should
priest and prophet be slain in the
sanctuary of the Lord?
21 There in the streets both young and
old lie prostrate on the ground. My
maidens and my young men have fallen
by the sword; you have slain them on
the day of your anger, slaughtered them
without pity.
22 You summoned my enemies from
every side, like men assembled for a
festival; on the day of the LORD's anger
no one escaped, not one survived. All
whom I have held in my arms and reared
my enemies have destroyed.Lamentations 3.1–13
10
1 I am the man who has known
3 affliction under the rod of the wrath
of the LORD.
2 It was I whom he led away and left to
walk in darkness, where no light is.
3 Against me alone he has turned his
hand, and so it is all day long.
4 He has wasted away my flesh and my
skin and broken my bones;
5 he has built up as walls around me
bitterness and hardship;
6 he has cast me into a place of
darkness like those long dead.
7 He has hemmed me in so that I cannot
escape; he has weighed me down with
fetters.
8 Even when I cry out and plead for help
he rejects my prayer.
9 He has barred my road with blocks of
stone and entangled my way.
10 He lies in wait for me like a bear or a
lion lurking in a covert.
11 He has forced me aside, thrown me
down, and left me desolate.
12 He has bent his bow and made me
the target for his arrows;
13 he has pierced right to my kidneys
with shafts drawn from his quiver.Lamentations 3.14– 26
11
14 I have become a laughing-stock to all
nations, the butt of their mocking songs
all day.
15 He has given me my fill of bitter herbs
and made me drink deep of wormwood.
16 He has broken my teeth on gravel;
racked with pain, I am fed on ashes.
17 Peace has gone from my life and I
have forgotten what prosperity is.
18 Then I cry out that my strength has
gone and so has my hope in the LORD.
19 The memory of my distress and my
wanderings is wormwood and gall.
20 I remember them indeed and am
filled with despondency.
21 I shall wait patiently because I take
this to heart:
22 The LORD's love is surely not
exhausted, nor has his compassion
failed;
23 they are new every morning, so great
is his constancy.
24 The LORD, I say, is all that I have;
therefore I shall wait for him patiently.
25 The LORD is good to those who look
to him, to anyone who seeks him;
26 it is good to wait in patience for
deliverance by the LORD.Lamentations 3.27– 39
12
27 It is good for a man to bear the yoke
from youth.
28 Let him sit alone in silence if it is
heavy on him;
29 let him lie face downwards on the
ground, and there may yet be hope;
30 let him offer his cheek to the smiter
and endure full measure of abuse.
31 For rejection by the Lord does not
last for ever.
32 He may punish, yet he will have
compassion in the fullness of his unfailing
love;
33 he does not willingly afflict or punish
any mortal.
34 To trample underfoot prisoners
anywhere on earth,
35 to deprive a man of his rights in
defiance of the Most High,
36 to pervert justice in the courts -- such
things the Lord has never approved.
37 Who can command and have it done
if the Lord has forbidden it?
38 Do not both bad and good proceed
from the mouth of the Most High?
39 Why should any man living complain,
any mortal who has sinned?Lamentations 3.40– 52
13
40 Let us examine our ways and test
them and turn back to the LORD;
41 let us lift up our hearts and our hands
to God in heaven, saying:
42 We have sinned and rebelled, and
you have not forgiven.
43 You have covered us in anger,
pursued us, and slain without pity;
44 you have covered yourself with cloud
beyond reach of our prayers;
45 you have treated us as scum and
refuse among the nations.
46 Our enemies all jeer at us with open
mouths.
47 Before us lie hunter's scare and pit,
devastation and ruin.
48 My eyes run with streams of water
because of my people's wound.
49 My eyes stream with unceasing tears
and refuse all comfort,
50 while the LORD looks down and sees
from heaven.
51 My eyes ache because of the fate of
all the women of my city.
52 Those who for no reason were my
enemies drove me cruelly like a bird;Lamentations 3.53– 65
14
53 to silence me they thrust me alive
into the pit and closed the opening with
a boulder;
54 waters rose above my head, and I
said, My end has come.
55 But I called, LORD, on your name
from the depths of the pit;
56 you heard my plea: Do not turn a
deaf ear when I cry out for relief.
57 You came near when I called to you;
you said, Have no fear.
58 Lord, you pleaded my cause; you
came to my rescue.
59 You saw the injustice done to me,
LORD, and gave judgement in my
favour;
60 you saw all their vindictive behaviour,
all their plotting against me.
61 You heard their bitter scorn, LORD,
all their plotting,
62 the whispering and murmuring of my
adversaries the livelong day.
63 See how, whether they sit or stand, I
am the object of their taunts.
64 Pay them back for their deeds, LORD,
pay them as they deserve.
65 Show them how hard your heart can
be, how little concern you have for them.Lamentations 3.66–4.7
15
66 Pursue them in anger and wipe them
out from beneath your heavens, LORD.
1 How dulled is the gold, how
tarnished the fine gold! The stones of
the sanctuary lie strewn at every street
corner.
2 See Zion's precious sons, once worth
their weight in finest gold, now counted
as clay jars, the work of any potter's
hand.
3 Even whales uncover the teat and
suckle their young; but the daughters of
my people are heartless as the ostriches
of the desert.
4 With thirst the sucking infant's tongue
cleaves to the roof of its mouth; young
children beg for bread, but no one offers
them a crumb.
5 Those who once fed delicately are
desolate in the streets; those brought up
in purple garments now grovel on refuse
heaps.
6 The penalty inflicted on my people is
worse than the punishment of Sodom,
which suffered overthrow in a moment,
and no hands were wrung.
7 Her crowned princes were once purer
than snow, whiter than milk; they were
4Lamentations 4.8–13
16
ruddier than branching coral; their limbs
were lapis lazuli.
8 But their faces turned blacker than
soot, and no one knew them in the
streets; the skin was shrivelled tight
over their bones, dry as touchwood.
9 Those who died by the sword were
more fortunate than those who died of
hunger, who wasted away, deprived of
the produce of the field.
10 With their own hands tender-hearted
women boiled their own children; their
children became their food on the day of
my people's wounding.
11 The LORD glutted his rage and poured
forth his fierce anger; he kindled a fire in
Zion that burnt to the very foundations.
12 No one, neither the kings of the
earth nor any other inhabitant of the
world, believed that any adversary, any
foe could penetrate within the gates of
Jerusalem.
13 It happened for the sins of her
prophets, for the crimes of her priests,
who had shed within her walls the blood
of the righteous.Lamentations 4.14– 21
17
14 They wandered blindly in the streets;
they are so stained with blood that no
one would touch even their garments.
15 Go away! Unclean! people cried to
them. Away! Do not come near! They
hastened away, wandering among the
nations, unable to find any resting-place.
16 The LORD himself scattered them, he
thought of them no more; he showed no
favour to priests, no pity for elders.
17 Still we strain our eyes, looking
in vain for help. We have watched
and watched for a nation that proved
powerless to save.
18 When we go out, we take to byways
to avoid the public streets; our days are
all but finished, our end has come.
19 Our pursuers have shown themselves
swifter than eagles in the heavens; they
are hot on our trail over the hills, they
waylay us in the wilderness.
20 The LORD's anointed, the breath of
life to us, was caught in their traps;
although we had thought to live among
the nations, safe under his protection.
21 Rejoice and be glad, daughters of
Edom, dwellers in the land of Uz. Yet
the cup will pass to you in your turn,Lamentations 4.22–5.7
18
and when drunk you will expose your
nakedness.
22 The punishment for your sin,
daughter of Zion, is now complete, and
never again will you be carried into exile.
But you, daughter of Edom, your sin will
be punished, and your guilt revealed.
1 REMEMBER, LORD, what has
befallen us; look, and see how we
are scorned.
2 The land we possessed is turned over
to strangers, our homes to foreigners.
3 We are like orphans, without a father;
our mothers are like widows.
4 We have to buy water to drink, water
which is ours; our own wood can be had
only for payment.
5 The yoke is on our necks, we are
harassed; we are weary, but allowed no
rest.
6 We came to terms, now with Egypt,
now with Assyria, to provide us with
food.
7 Our forefathers sinned; now they are
no more, and we must bear the burden
of their guilt.
5Lamentations 5.8–19
19
8 Slaves have become our rulers, and
there is no one to free us from their
power.
9 We must bring in our food from the
wilderness at the risk of our lives in the
scorching heat.
10 Our skins are blackened as in a
furnace by the ravages of starvation.
11 Women were raped in Zion, virgins
ravished in the towns of Judah.
12 Princes were hung up by their hands;
elders received no respect.
13 Young men toil, grinding at the mill;
boys stagger under loads of wood.
14 Old men have left off their sessions
at the city gate; young men no longer
pluck the strings.
15 Joy has vanished from our hearts;
our dancing is turned to mourning.
16 The garlands have fallen from our
heads. Woe to us, sinners that we are!
17 This is why we are sick at heart; all
this is why our eyes grow dim:
18 Mount Zion is desolate and overrun
with jackals.
19 LORD, your reign is for ever, your
throne endures from age to age.Lamentations 5.20– 22
20
20 Why do you forget us so completely
and forsake us these many days?
21 LORD, turn us back to you, and we
shall come back; renew our days as in
times long past.
22 But you have utterly rejected us;
your anger against us has been great
indeed.Ezekiel
1 ON the fifth day of the fourth month
1 in the thirtieth year, while I was
among the exiles by the river Kebar, the
heavens were opened and I saw visions
from God.
2 On the fifth day of the month in the
fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin,
3 the word of the LORD came to the
priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in Chaldaea
by the river Kebar, and there the LORD's
hand was upon him.
4 In my vision I saw a storm-wind
coming from the north, a vast cloud with
flashes of fire and brilliant light about
it; and within was a radiance like brass,
glowing in the heart of the flames.
5 In the fire was the likeness of four
living creatures in human form.
6 Each had four faces and each four
wings;
7 their legs were straight, and their
hoofs were like the hoofs of a calf,
glistening and gleaming like bronze.Ezekiel 1.8– 15
2
8 Under the wings on each of the
four sides were human hands; all four
creatures had faces and wings,
9 and the wings of one touched those
of another. They did not turn as they
moved; each creature went straight
forward.
10 This is what their faces were like: all
four had a human face and a lion's face
on the right, on the left the face of an ox
and the face of an eagle.
11 Their wings were spread upwards;
each living creature had one pair
touching those of its neighbour, while
one pair covered its body.
12 They moved forward in whatever
direction the spirit went; they never
swerved from their course.
13 The appearance of the creatures was
as if fire from burning coals or torches
were darting to and fro among them;
the fire was radiant, and out of the fire
came lightning.
14 [[EMPTY]]
15 As I looked at the living creatures, I
saw wheels on the ground, one beside
each of the four.Ezekiel 1.16–23
3
16 The wheels sparkled like topaz, and
they were all alike: in form and working
they were like a wheel inside a wheel,
17 and when they moved in any of the
four directions they never swerved from
their course.
18 I saw that they had rims, and the
rims were covered with eyes all around.
19 When the living creatures moved,
the wheels moved beside them; when
the creatures rose from the ground, the
wheels rose;
20 they moved in whichever direction
the spirit went; and the wheels rose
together with them, for the spirit of the
creatures was in the wheels.
21 When one moved, the other moved;
when one halted, the other halted; when
the creatures rose from the ground, the
wheels rose together with them, for the
spirit of the creatures was in the wheels.
22 Above the heads of the living
creatures was, as it were, a vault
glittering like a sheet of ice, awe-
inspiring, stretched over their heads
above them.
23 Under the vault their wings were
spread straight out, touching oneEzekiel 1.24–2.1
4
another, while one pair covered the body
of each.
24 I heard, too, the noise of their wings;
when they moved it was like the noise of
a mighty torrent or a thunderclap, like
the noise of a crowd or an armed camp;
when they halted their wings dropped.
25 A voice was heard from above the
vault over their heads, as they halted
with drooping wings.
26 Above the vault over their heads
there appeared, as it were, a sapphire in
the shape of a throne, and exalted on
the throne a form in human likeness.
27 From his waist upwards I saw what
might have been brass glowing like
fire in a furnace; and from his waist
downwards I saw what looked like fire.
Radiance encircled him.
28 Like a rainbow in the clouds after
the rain was the sight of that encircling
radiance; it was like the appearance of
the glory of the LORD. When I saw this I
prostrated myself, and I heard a voice:
1 Stand up, O man, he said, and let
me talk with you.
2Ezekiel 2.2–8
5
2 As he spoke, a spirit came into me
and stood me on my feet, and I listened
to him speaking.
3 He said to me, O man, I am sending
you to the Israelites, rebels who have
rebelled against me. They and their
forefathers have been in revolt against
me to this very day,
4 and this generation to which I am
sending you is stubborn and obstinate.
You are to say to them, These are the
words of the Lord GOD,
5 and they will know that they have
a prophet among them, whether they
listen or whether in their rebelliousness
they refuse to listen.
6 But you, O man, must not be afraid of
them or of what they say, though they
resist and reject you and you are sitting
on scorpions. There is nothing to fear in
their rebellious words, nothing to make
you afraid in their rebellious looks.
7 You must speak my words to them,
whether they listen or whether in their
rebelliousness they refuse to listen.
8 But you, O man, must heed what I say
and not be rebellious like them. OpenEzekiel 2.9–3.6
6
your mouth and eat what I am giving
you.
9 I saw a hand stretched out to me,
holding a scroll.
10 He unrolled it before me, and it was
written on both sides, back and front,
with dirges and laments and words of
woe.
1 Then he said to me, O man, eat
what is in front of you; eat this scroll;
then go and speak to the Israelites.
2 I opened my mouth and he gave me
the scroll to eat,
3 saying, O man, swallow this scroll I
give you, and eat your fill. I ate it, and it
tasted as sweet as honey to me.
4 O man, he said to me, go to the
Israelites and declare my message to
them.
5 It is not to people whose speech is
thick and difficult you are sent, but to
Israelites.
6 I am not sending you to great nations
whose speech is so thick and so difficult
that you cannot make out what they
say; had I sent you to them they would
have listened to you.
3Ezekiel 3.7– 14
7
7 But the Israelites will refuse to listen
to you, for they refuse to listen to
me; all of them are brazen-faced and
stubborn-hearted.
8 But I shall make you a match for
them. I shall make you as brazen and as
stubborn as they are.
9 I shall make your brow like adamant,
harder than flint. Do not fear them,
do not be terrified by them, rebellious
though they are.
10 He went on: Listen carefully, O man,
to all that I have to say to you, and take
it to heart.
11 Then go to your fellow-countrymen
in exile and say to them, These are the
words of the Lord GOD, whether they
listen or refuse to listen.
12 A spirit lifted me up, and I heard
behind me a fierce rushing sound as the
glory of the LORD rose from his place.
13 I heard the sound of the living
creatures' wings brushing against one
another, and the sound of the wheels
beside them, a fierce rushing sound.
14 A spirit lifted me and carried me
along, and I went full of exaltation, the
power of the LORD strong upon me.Ezekiel 3.15–20
8
15 So I came to the exiles at Tel-abib
who were settled by the river Kebar. For
seven days I stayed there among them
in a state of consternation.
16 At the end of seven days this word of
the LORD came to me:
17 I have appointed you, O man, a
watchman for the Israelites; you will
pass to them the warnings you receive
from me.
18 If I pronounce sentence of death on a
wicked person and you have not warned
him or spoken out to dissuade him from
his wicked ways and so save his life, that
person will die because of his sin, but I
shall hold you answerable for his death.
19 But if you have warned him and he
persists in his wicked ways, he will die
because of his sin, but you will have
discharged your duty.
20 Again, if someone who is righteous
goes astray and does wrong, and I cause
his downfall, he will die because you
have not warned him. He will die for his
sin; the righteous deeds he has done will
not be taken into account, and I shall
hold you responsible for his death.Ezekiel 3.21–27
9
21 But if you have warned the righteous
person not to sin and he does not sin,
then he will have saved his life because
he heeded the warning, and you will
have discharged your duty.
22 THE LORD's hand was upon me there,
and he said to me, Rise, go out into the
plain, and there I shall speak to you.
23 I arose, and when I went out into the
plain, the glory of the LORD was there,
like the glory which I had seen by the
river Kebar, and I prostrated myself.
24 Then a spirit came and set me on
my feet. The LORD spoke to me: Go, he
said, and shut yourself up in your house.
25 You will be tied and bound with ropes,
O man, so that you cannot go out among
the people.
26 I shall make your tongue cleave to
the roof of your mouth and you will be
unable to speak and so rebuke them,
that rebellious people.
27 But when I have something to say
to you, I shall give you back the power
of speech. Then you will declare to
them, This is what the Lord GOD said. If
anyone will listen, he may listen; and ifEzekiel 4.1–6
10
anyone refuses to listen, he may refuse.
Rebels indeed they are!
1 O man, take a tile and lay it in front
of you. Draw a city on it, the city of
Jerusalem:
2 portray it under siege, erect towers
against it, raise a siege-ramp, put
mantelets in position, and bring up
battering-rams on every side.
3 Then take a griddle, and put it as if
it were an iron wall between you and
the city. Keep your eyes fixed on the
city; it will be the besieged and you
the besieger. This will be a sign to the
Israelites.
4 Next, lie on your left side, putting the
weight of Israel's punishment on it; for
as many days as you lie on that side you
will be bearing their punishment.
5 I ordain that you bear Israel's
punishment for three hundred and ninety
days, allowing one day for each year of
their punishment.
6 When you have completed these days,
lie down again, this time on your right
side, and bear Judah's punishment; I
ordain for you forty days, one day for
each year.
4Ezekiel 4.7– 14
11
7 Then fix your gaze towards the
siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm
prophesy against it.
8 See how I tie you with ropes so that
you cannot turn over from one side to
the other until you complete your days
of siege.
9 Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils,
millet, and vetches, and mixing them
all in one bowl make your bread from
them. You are to eat it during the three
hundred and ninety days you spend lying
on your side.
10 Twenty shekels weight is your ration
for a day, eaten at a set time each day.
11 You are to measure out your drinking
water; you may drink a sixth of a hin at
a set time each day.
12 The bread you are to eat is to be
baked like barley cakes, with human
dung as fuel, and you must bake it where
people can see you.'
13 The LORD said, This is the unclean
bread that the Israelites will eat among
the peoples where I shall banish them.
14 I protested: Lord GOD, I have never
been made unclean. Never in my whole
life have I eaten what has died a naturalEzekiel 4.15–5.4
12
death or been mauled by wild beasts; no
tainted meat has ever passed my lips.
15 He answered, Very well; I shall allow
you to use cow dung instead of human
dung to bake your bread.
16 He then said, O man, I am cutting
short their daily bread in Jerusalem;
people will weigh out anxiously the bread
they eat, and measure with dismay the
water they drink.
17 So their food and their water will run
short until dismay spreads from one to
another and they waste away because of
their iniquity.
1 O man, take a sharp sword, and use
it like a razor to shave your head and
your chin. Then take scales and divide
the hair into three lots.
2 When the siege comes to an end,
burn one third of the hair in a fire in the
centre of the city; cut up one third with
the sword round about the city; scatter
the last third to the wind, and I shall
follow it with drawn sword.
3 Take a few of these hairs and tie them
up in a fold of your robe.
4 Then take others, throw them into the
fire and burn them. Say to all Israel:
5Ezekiel 5.5– 11
13
5 These are the words of the Lord GOD:
This city of Jerusalem I have set among
the nations, with lands all around her,
6 but she has rebelled against my laws
and my statutes more wickedly than
those nations and lands; for her people
have rejected my laws and refused to
conform to my statutes.
7 The Lord GOD says: Since you
have been more insubordinate than
the nations around you and have not
conformed to my statutes and have not
kept my laws or even the laws of the
nations around you,
8 therefore, says the Lord GOD, I in turn
shall be against you; in the sight of the
nations I shall execute judgements in
your midst,
9 such judgements as I have never
executed before, nor ever shall again, so
abominable have all your offences been.
10 Parents will eat their children and
children their parents in your midst,
Jerusalem; I shall execute judgements
on you, and any who survive in you I
shall scatter to the four winds.
11 As I live, says the Lord GOD, because
you have defiled my holy place with allEzekiel 5.12–16
14
your vile and abominable rites, I in turn
shall destroy you and show no pity; I
shall spare no one.
12 One third of your people will die by
pestilence or perish by famine in your
midst; one third will fall by the sword in
the country round about; and one third I
shall scatter to the four winds and follow
with drawn sword.
13 When my anger is spent and my fury
is abated I shall be appeased; when my
fury against them is spent they will know
that I, the LORD, have spoken in my
jealousy.
14 I have reduced you to a ruin, an
object of mockery to the nations around
you, and all who pass by will see it.
15 You will be an object of mockery and
abuse, an appalling lesson to the nations
round about, when I pass sentence on
you and execute judgement in anger and
fury. I, the LORD, have spoken.
16 When I loose the deadly arrows
of famine against you, arrows of
destruction, I shall shoot them to
destroy you. I shall send one famine
after another on you and cut off your
daily bread;Ezekiel 5.17–6.6
15
17 I shall unleash famine and savage
beasts on you, and they will leave you
childless. Pestilence and bloodshed will
sweep through you, and I shall bring the
sword against you. I, the LORD, have
spoken.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, face towards the mountains of
Israel and prophesy against them
3 and say: Mountains of Israel, listen to
the word of the Lord GOD. He says this to
the mountains and hills, the ravines and
valleys: I am bringing a sword against
you, and I shall destroy your shrines.
4 Your altars will be devastated, your
incense-altars shattered, and I shall
throw down your slain in front of your
idols.
5 I shall lay the corpses of the Israelites
before their idols and scatter your bones
around your altars.
6 In all your settlements the blood-
spattered altars will be laid waste and
the shrines devastated. Your altars will
be laid waste and devastated, your idols
shattered and brought to an end, your
6Ezekiel 6.7– 12
16
incense-altars hewn down, and the gods
you have made will be wiped out.
7 As the slain fall all about you, you will
know that I am the LORD.
8 But among the nations there will be
some of you that have survived the
sword, and are scattered in foreign
lands.
9 They will remember me in exile among
the nations, when I destroy their wanton
and wayward hearts and their eyes
which rove wantonly after their idols.
Then they will loathe themselves for
the evil they have done with all their
abominations.
10 Then they will know that I, the LORD,
was uttering no vain threat when I said
that I would inflict this evil on them.
11 The Lord GOD says: Beat your hands
together, stamp your feet, bemoan all
your vile abominations, people of Israel,
who will fall by sword, famine, and
pestilence.
12 Those far away will die by pestilence;
those nearer home will fall by the sword;
any who survive or are spared will die by
famine, and so at last my anger at them
will be spent.Ezekiel 6.13–7.5
17
13 You will know that I am the LORD
when their slain fall among the idols
round their altars, on every high hill or
mountaintop, under every spreading
tree or leafy terebinth, wherever they
have offered sweet-smelling sacrifices to
appease all their idols.
14 I shall stretch out my hand over
them and reduce the land in all their
settlements to a desolate waste, more
desolate than the desert of Riblah. Then
they will know that I am the LORD.
1 This word of the LORD came to me:
2 O man, the Lord GOD says to the
land of Israel: The end is coming on the
four corners of the earth.
3 Now the end is upon you; I shall
unleash my anger against you; I shall
call you to account for your conduct and
bring all your abominations on your own
heads.
4 I shall neither show pity, nor spare
you; I shall make you suffer for your
conduct and the abominations that are
in your midst. Then you will know that I
am the LORD.
5 The Lord GOD says: Disasters are
coming, one after another.
7Ezekiel 7.6– 13
18
6 The end is coming; it is roused against
you.
7 Doom is coming upon you, dweller in
the land; the time is coming, the day is
near, a day of panic and not of rejoicing.
8 Very soon I shall vent my wrath on
you and let my anger spend itself. I shall
call you to account for your conduct and
bring all your abominations on your own
heads.
9 I shall neither show pity nor spare
you; I shall make you suffer for your
conduct and the abominations that are
in your midst. Then you will know that it
is I, the LORD, who struck you.
10 The day is coming, doom is here; it
has burst upon them. Injustice buds,
insolence blossoms.
11 Violence leads to flagrant injustice.
Is it not their fault, the fault of their
turbulence and tumult? There is nothing
but turmoil in them.
12 The time has come, the day has
arrived; there is no joy for the buyer,
no sorrow for the seller, for their turmoil
has called forth my wrath.
13 The seller will not recover what he
has sold in their lifetime, for because ofEzekiel 7.14–20
19
all the turmoil the agreement will never
be revoked, and because of their sin
none will have a sure hold on life.
14 The trumpet has sounded and all are
ready, but no one goes to war, for their
turmoil has called forth my wrath.
15 Outside is the sword, inside are
pestilence and famine; those in the
country will die by the sword, those in
the city will be devoured by famine and
pestilence.
16 If any escape like moaning doves and
take to the mountains, there I shall slay
them, each for his iniquity,
17 while every hand hangs limp and
every knee turns to water.
18 They will go in sackcloth, shuddering
from head to foot, with faces downcast
and heads close shaved.
19 They will fling their silver into the
street and treat their gold like so much
filth; their silver and gold will not avail
to save them on the day of the LORD's
fury. Their hunger will not be satisfied,
nor their bellies filled; for their iniquity
will be the cause of their downfall.
20 Their beautiful jewellery, which was
their pride and delight, they have madeEzekiel 7.21–27
20
into vile, abominable images. Therefore
I shall treat their jewellery as so much
filth,
21 I shall hand it over as plunder to
foreigners and as booty to earth's most
evil nations, who will defile it.
22 I shall turn my face from them, while
brigands encroach on my treasured land
to defile it
23 and create confusion, for the land
is full of bloodshed and the city full of
violence.
24 I shall let in the most ruthless of
nations to take possession of the houses;
I shall quell the pride of the strong, and
their sanctuaries will be profaned.
25 Shuddering will come over my
people, and they will look in vain for
peace.
26 Tempest will follow upon tempest and
rumour upon rumour. People will pester
a prophet for a vision; there will be no
more guidance from a priest, no counsel
from elders.
27 The king will go mourning, the ruler
will be clothed with terror, the hands of
the people will shake with fright. I shall
deal with them as they deserve, and callEzekiel 8.1–6
21
them to account for their conduct. Then
they will know that I am the LORD.
1 ON the fifth day of the sixth month
in the sixth year, as I was sitting
at home and the elders of Judah were
sitting with me, suddenly I felt the power
of the Lord GOD come upon me.
2 I saw what looked like a man; from
the waist down he seemed to be all
fire and from the waist up to shine and
glitter like brass.
3 He stretched out what appeared to be
a hand and took me by the forelock. In
a vision from God a spirit lifted me up
between earth and heaven, carried me
to Jerusalem, and put me down at the
entrance to the inner gate facing north,
where stands the idolatrous image which
arouses God's indignation.
4 The glory of the God of Israel was
there, like the vision I had seen in the
plain.
5 The LORD said to me, O man, look
northwards. I did so, and there to the
north of the Altar Gate, at the entrance,
was that idolatrous image.
6 O man, he said, do you see what they
are doing? The monstrous abominations
8Ezekiel 8.7– 13
22
which the Israelites practise here are
making me abandon my sanctuary, and
you will see even greater abominations.
7 Then he brought me to the entrance
of the court, where I saw that there was
a hole in the wall.
8 O man, he said to me, dig through the
wall. I did so, and made an opening.
9 Go in, he said, and see the vile
abominations they practise here.
10 I went in and saw figures of creeping
things, beasts, and vermin, and all the
idols of the Israelites, carved round the
walls.
11 Standing in front of them were
seventy elders of Israel, with Jaazaniah
son of Shaphan in the middle, and
each held a censer from which rose the
fragrant smoke of incense.
12 He said to me, O man, do you see
what the elders of Israel are doing in
darkness, each at the shrine of his own
carved image? They think that the LORD
does not see them, that he has forsaken
the land.
13 You will see even greater
abominations practised by them,
he said.Ezekiel 8.14–9.1
23
14 Next he brought me to the gateway of
the LORD's house which faces north; and
there sat women wailing for Tammuz.
15 O man, do you see that? he asked me.
But you will see greater abominations
than these.
16 So he brought me to the inner court
of the LORD's house, and there, by the
entrance to the sanctuary of the LORD,
between porch and altar, were some
twenty-five men with their backs to the
sanctuary and their faces to the east,
prostrating themselves to the rising sun.
17 He said to me, O man, do you see
that? Do you think it a trifling matter for
Judah to practise these abominations
here? They have filled the land with
violence and have provoked me to anger
again and again. Look at them at their
worship, holding twigs to their noses.
18 I shall turn on them in my rage and
show them no pity, nor spare them.
Loudly though they cry to me, I shall not
listen.
1 A loud voice rang in my ears:
Here they come, those appointed to
punish the city, each carrying his weapon
of destruction.
9Ezekiel 9.2–7
24
2 I saw six men approaching from the
road that leads to the upper gate which
faces north, each carrying a battle-club,
and among them one was dressed in
linen, with a writer's pen and ink at his
waist; they advanced until they stood by
the bronze altar.
3 The glory of the God of Israel had
risen from above the cherubim where it
rested, and had come to the terrace of
the temple. He called to the man dressed
in linen, with pen and ink at his waist.
4 Go through the city of Jerusalem,
said the LORD, and mark with a cross
the foreheads of those who groan
and lament over all the abominations
practised there.
5 To the others I heard him say, Follow
him through the city and deal out death;
show no pity; spare no one.
6 Kill and destroy men old and young,
girls, little children, and women, but
touch no one who bears the mark. Begin
at my sanctuary. So they began with the
elders in front of the temple.
7 Defile the temple, he said, and fill the
courts with dead bodies; then go out and
spread death in the city.Ezekiel 9.8–10.2
25
8 While the killing went on, I was left
alone, and I threw myself on the ground,
crying out, Lord GOD, are you going
to destroy all the Israelites who are
left, in this outpouring of your anger on
Jerusalem?
9 He answered, The iniquity of Israel
and Judah is very great indeed; the land
is full of bloodshed, the city is filled with
injustice. They are saying, The LORD has
forsaken the land and does not see.
10 But I shall show no pity, nor spare
them; I shall make their conduct recoil
on their own heads.
11 When the man dressed in linen, with
pen and ink at his waist, returned he
reported: I have carried out your orders.
1 Then in my vision I saw, above
the vault over the heads of the
cherubim, as it were a sapphire in the
shape of a throne.
2 The LORD said to the man dressed
in linen, Come in between the circling
wheels under the cherubim, and take
a handful of the burning embers lying
among the cherubim; then throw it over
the city. As I watched he went in.
10Ezekiel 10.3– 9
26
3 The cherubim stood on the right side
of the temple as the man entered, and a
cloud filled the inner court.
4 The glory of the LORD rose high above
the cherubim and moved to the terrace
of the temple; and the temple was filled
with the cloud, while the radiance of the
glory of the LORD filled the court.
5 The sound of the wings of the
cherubim could be heard as far as the
outer court; it was as if God Almighty
were speaking.
6 When the man dressed in linen was
told by the LORD to take fire from
between the circling wheels and from
among the cherubim, he went and stood
by a wheel,
7 and one of the cherubim reached out
to the fire that was in their midst and,
taking some fire, handed it to the man
dressed in linen, who received it and
went away.
8 Under the wings of the cherubim there
could be seen what looked like a human
hand.
9 I saw four wheels beside the
cherubim, one wheel beside eachEzekiel 10.10–16
27
cherub. In appearance they were like
sparkling topaz,
10 and all four were alike, like a wheel
inside a wheel.
11 When the cherubim moved in any of
the four directions, they never swerved
from their course; they went straight
on in the direction in which their heads
were turned, never swerving.
12 Their whole bodies, the backs, hands,
and wings of all four of them, as well as
the wheels, were covered all over with
eyes,
13 and I could hear the whirring of the
wheels.
14 Each had four faces: the first was a
cherub's face, the second a human face,
the third a lion's face, and the fourth an
eagle's face.
15 The cherubim raised themselves from
the ground, those same living creatures
I had seen by the river Kebar.
16 When they moved, the wheels moved
beside them; when they lifted their
wings and rose from the ground, the
wheels did not move from their side.Ezekiel 10.17–11.1
28
17 When one halted, the other halted;
when one rose, the other rose, for the
spirit of the creatures was in the wheels.
18 The glory of the LORD left the temple
terrace and halted above the cherubim.
19 They spread their wings and raised
themselves from the ground; I watched
them go with the wheels beside them.
They halted at the eastern gateway of
the LORD's house, with the glory of the
God of Israel over them.
20 These were the living creatures I had
seen beneath the God of Israel at the
river Kebar, and so I knew that they
were cherubim.
21 Each had four faces and four wings
and what looked like human hands under
their wings.
22 Their faces were like those I had seen
in my vision by the river Kebar. They all
moved straight forward.
1 A spirit lifted me up and brought
me to the eastward-facing gate of
the LORD's house. There by the gateway
I saw twenty-five men, among them two
of high office, Jaazaniah son of Azzur
and Pelatiah son of Benaiah.
11Ezekiel 11.2–10
29
2 The LORD said to me, O man, these
are the men who are planning mischief
and offering bad advice in this city,
3 saying, The time has not yet come to
build; the city is a cooking pot and we
are the meat in it.
4 Therefore, he said, prophesy against
them, O man, prophesy.
5 The spirit of the LORD came upon me,
and he told me to say, These are the
words of the LORD: This is what you are
saying to yourselves, you men of Israel;
well do I know the thoughts that rise in
your mind.
6 You have caused the death of many
in this city, heaping the streets with the
dead.
7 Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD
says: The bodies of your victims, they
are the meat, and the city is the cooking
pot. But I shall drive you out of the city.
8 You fear the sword, and it is a sword I
shall bring on you, says the Lord GOD.
9 I shall drive you out of the city and
hand you over to a foreign power; I shall
bring you to justice.
10 You will fall by the sword when I
bring you to judgement on the frontierEzekiel 11.11–16
30
of Israel; thus you will know that I am
the LORD.
11 So the city will no longer be your
cooking pot, nor you the meat in it; on
the frontier of Israel I shall bring you to
judgement.
12 Then you will know that I am the
LORD. You have not conformed to my
statutes, nor kept my laws, but have
followed the laws of the nations round
about you.
13 While I was prophesying, Pelatiah
son of Benaiah fell dead; and I threw
myself on the ground, crying aloud, Lord
GOD, are you going to make an end of
all the Israelites who are left?
14 This word of the LORD came to me:
15 O man, they are your brothers and
your kinsmen, this whole people of
Israel, to whom the inhabitants now in
Jerusalem have said, They are separated
far from the LORD; the land has been
made over to us to possess.
16 Say therefore: These are the words
of the Lord GOD: When I sent them far
away among the nations and dispersed
them over the earth, for a little time IEzekiel 11.17–23
31
became their sanctuary in the countries
to which they had gone.
17 Say therefore: These are the words
of the Lord GOD: I shall gather you
from among the nations and bring you
together from the countries where you
have been dispersed, and I shall give the
land of Israel to you.
18 When they come there, they will
abolish all the vile and abominable
practices.
19 I shall give them singleness of heart
and put a new spirit in them; I shall
remove the heart of stone from their
bodies and give them a heart of flesh,
20 so that they will conform to my
statutes and keep my laws. They will be
my people, and I shall be their God.
21 But those whose hearts are set on
vile and abominable practices will be
made to answer for all they have done.
This is the word of the Lord GOD.
22 Then the cherubim lifted their wings,
with the wheels beside them and the
glory of the God of Israel above them.
23 The glory of the LORD rose up and
left the city, and halted on the mountain
to the east of it.Ezekiel 11.24–12.6
32
24 In a vision sent by the spirit of God, a
spirit lifted me up and brought me back
to the exiles in Chaldaea. After the vision
left me,
25 I told the exiles all that the LORD had
revealed to me.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, you are living among a
rebellious people. They have eyes and
see nothing; they have ears and hear
nothing, because they are rebellious.
3 You must pack what you need, O man,
for going into exile, and set off by day
while they look on. When they see you
leave for exile, it may be they will realize
that they are rebellious.
4 Bring out your belongings, packed as
if for exile; do it in the daytime in their
presence, and then again at evening, still
before them, leave home as if for exile;
5 break a hole through the wall, and
carry your belongings out through it.
6 Shoulder your pack in their presence,
and set off when dusk falls, with your
face covered so that you cannot see the
land, for I am making you a warning sign
for the Israelites.
12Ezekiel 12.7–13
33
7 I did exactly as I had been told. In the
daytime I brought out my belongings,
packed for exile; at evening with my
own hands I broke through the wall, and
when dusk fell I shouldered my pack and
carried it out before their eyes.
8 Next morning this word of the LORD
came to me:
9 O man, the Israelites, that rebellious
people, have asked you what you are
doing.
10 Tell them that these are the words of
the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the
ruler and all the people of Jerusalem.
11 Tell them that you are a sign to warn
them; what you have done will be done
to them; they will go as captives into
exile.
12 In the dusk their ruler will shoulder
his pack and go through a hole made to
let him out, with his face covered so that
he cannot see the land.
13 But I shall throw my net over him,
and he will be caught in the meshes. I
shall take him to Babylon, to the land
of the Chaldaeans, where he will die
without ever seeing it.Ezekiel 12.14–21
34
14 I shall scatter his bodyguard and
drive all his squadrons to the four winds;
I shall pursue them with drawn sword.
15 Then they will know that I am the
LORD, when I disperse them among the
nations and scatter them over the earth.
16 But I shall leave a few of them,
survivors of the sword, famine,
and pestilence, to describe all their
abominations to the peoples among
whom they go. They will know that I am
the LORD.
17 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
18 O man, as you eat your bread you
are to tremble, and as you drink the
water you are to shudder with fear.
19 Say to the people: This is what
the Lord GOD says concerning the
inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of
Israel: They will eat bread with fear
and be filled with horror as they drink
water; the land will be waste and empty
because of the violence of all who live
there.
20 Inhabited towns will be deserted, and
the land will become a waste. Thus you
will know that I am the LORD.
21 This word of the LORD came to me:Ezekiel 12.22–13.1
35
22 O man, what is this proverb current
in the land of Israel: Days pass and
visions perish?
23 Very well! Say to them: This is what
the Lord GOD says: I have put an end
to this proverb; it will never again be
quoted in Israel. Rather say to them:
The days are near when every vision will
be fulfilled.
24 There will be no more false visions,
no misleading divination among the
Israelites,
25 for I, the LORD, shall say what I will,
and it will be done. It will be put off no
longer: you rebellious people, in your
lifetime I shall do what I have said. This
is the word of the Lord GOD.
26 This word of the LORD came to me:
27 O man, the Israelites say, The visions
which prophets now see are not to
be fulfilled for many years: they are
prophesying of a time far off.
28 Very well! Say to them: This is what
the Lord GOD said: No word of mine will
be delayed; whatever I say will be done.
This is the word of the Lord GOD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
13Ezekiel 13.2– 8
36
2 O man, prophesy against the prophets
of Israel who are prophesying; say to
those whose prophecies come from their
own minds: Hear what the LORD says:
3 These are the words of the Lord
GOD: Woe betide the prophets bent
on wickedness, who follow their own
enthusiasms, for they have seen no
vision!
4 Your prophets, Israel, have been like
jackals among ruins.
5 They have not stepped into the
breach to repair the broken wall for the
Israelites, so that they might stand firm
in battle on the day of the LORD.
6 The vision is false, the divination a lie!
They claim, It is the word of the LORD,
when it is not the LORD who has sent
them, yet they expect him to confirm
their prophecies!
7 Is it not a false vision that you
prophets have seen? Is not your
divination a lie? You call it the word
of the LORD, but it is not I who have
spoken.
8 The Lord GOD says: Because what
you say is false and your visions are aEzekiel 13.9–13
37
lie, therefore I have set myself against
you, says the Lord GOD.
9 I shall raise my hand against the
prophets whose visions are false, whose
divinations are a lie. They will have no
place in the assembly of my people;
their names will not be entered in the
roll of Israel, nor will they set foot on her
soil. Thus you will know that I am the
Lord GOD.
10 This they deserve, for they have
misled my people by saying that all
is well when nothing is well. It is as
if my people were building a wall and
the prophets used whitewash for the
daubing.
11 Tell these daubers that it will fall,
for rain will pour down in torrents, and
I shall send hailstones streaming down
and unleash a storm-wind.
12 When the wall collapses, it will be
said, Where is the plaster you used?
13 So this is what the Lord GOD
says: In my rage I shall unleash a
storm-wind; rain will come in torrents in
my anger, hailstones in my fury, until all
is destroyed.Ezekiel 13.14–19
38
14 I shall overthrow the wall which
you have daubed with whitewash and
level it to the ground, laying bare its
foundations. It will fall, and you will be
destroyed with it: thus you will know
that I am the LORD.
15 I shall vent my rage on the wall and
on those who daubed it with whitewash;
and I shall say, Gone is the wall and
gone those who daubed it,
16 those prophets of Israel who
prophesied to Jerusalem, who saw
visions of well-being for her when there
was no well-being. This is the word of
the Lord GOD.
17 Now set your face, O man, against
the women of your people whose
prophecies come from their own minds;
prophesy against them
18 and say: This is the word of the Lord
GOD: Woe betide you women who hunt
men's lives by sewing magic bands on
the wrists and putting veils over the
heads of persons of every age! Are you
to hunt the lives of my people and keep
your own lives safe?
19 You have dishonoured me in front of
my people for some handfuls of barleyEzekiel 13.20–14.1
39
and scraps of bread. By telling my people
lies they wish to hear, you bring death to
those who should not die, and keep alive
those who should not live.
20 So this is what the Lord GOD says:
I have set my face against your magic
bands with which you hunt men's lives
for the excitement of it. I shall tear them
from your arms and set free those lives
that you hunt just for excitement.
21 I shall tear up your veils; I shall
rescue my people from your clutches,
and you will no longer have it in your
power to hunt them. Thus you will know
that I am the LORD.
22 With your lying you undermined the
righteous, when I meant no hurt; you so
strengthened the wicked that they would
not abandon their evil ways and save
themselves.
23 So never again will you see your false
visions or practise divination. I shall
rescue my people from your clutches;
and thus you will know that I am the
LORD.
1 Some of the elders of Israel
visited me, and while they were
sitting in my presence
14Ezekiel 14.2– 7
40
2 this word of the LORD came to me,
3 O man, these people have set their
hearts on their idols and keep their eyes
fixed on the sinful things that cause their
downfall. Am I to be consulted by such
men?
4 Speak to them, therefore, and tell
them that this is what the Lord GOD
says: If any Israelite, with his heart set
on his idols and his eyes fixed on the
sinful things that cause his downfall,
comes to a prophet, I, the LORD,
give him his answer, despite his gross
idolatry.
5 My answer will grip the hearts of the
Israelites, who through their idols are all
estranged from me.
6 So tell the Israelites that this is what
the Lord GOD says: Repent, turn from
your idols, turn your backs on all your
abominations.
7 If anyone, Israelite or resident alien,
renounces me, setting his heart on idols
and fixing his eyes on the sinful things
that cause his downfall -- if such a one
comes to consult me through a prophet,
I, the LORD, shall give him his answer
directly.Ezekiel 14.8–14
41
8 I shall set my face against him; I shall
make him an example and a byword;
I shall root him out from among my
people. Thus you will know that I am the
LORD.
9 If a prophet is deceived into making
a prophecy, it is I, the LORD, who have
deceived him; I shall stretch out my
hand to destroy him and rid my people
Israel of him.
10 Both will be punished; the prophet
and the person who consults him alike
are guilty.
11 Never again will the Israelites stray
from their allegiance, never again defile
themselves by their sins; they will be my
people, and I shall be their God. This is
the word of the Lord GOD.
12 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
13 O man, when a country sins by
breaking faith with me, I stretch out
my hand and cut short its daily bread.
I send famine on it and destroy all the
inhabitants along with their cattle.
14 Even if these three men, Noah,
Daniel, and Job, were there, they would
by their righteousness save none butEzekiel 14.15–20
42
themselves. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
15 If I were to turn wild beasts loose in
a country to destroy the population, until
it became a waste through which no one
would pass for fear of the beasts,
16 and if those three men were there, as
I live, says the Lord GOD, they would not
be able to save even their own sons and
daughters; they would save themselves
alone, and the country would become a
waste.
17 Or if I were to bring the sword upon
that country, commanding it to pass
through the land, so that I might destroy
people and cattle,
18 and if those three men were there,
as I live, says the Lord GOD, they could
save neither son nor daughter; they
would save themselves alone.
19 Or if I were to send pestilence on
that land and pour out my fury on it in
bloodshed, destroying people and cattle,
20 and if Noah, Daniel, and Job were
there, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they
would save neither son nor daughter;
they would by their righteousness save
none but themselves.Ezekiel 14.21–15.3
43
21 The Lord GOD says: How much less
hope is there for Jerusalem when I inflict
on her these four terrible punishments
of mine, sword, famine, wild beasts, and
pestilence, to destroy both people and
cattle!
22 Yet some will be left in her, some
survivors to be brought out, both men
and women. Look at them as they come
out to you, and see how they have
behaved and what they have done. This
will be consolation to you for the disaster
I have brought on Jerusalem, for all I
have inflicted on her.
23 It will bring you consolation when you
consider how they have behaved and
what they have done; for you will know
that it was not without good reason that
I dealt thus with her. This is the word of
the Lord GOD.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, how is the vine better than
any other tree, than a branch from a
tree in the forest?
3 Is wood got from it useful for making
anything? Can one make it into a peg
and hang something on it?
15Ezekiel 15.4–16.3
44
4 If it is put on the fire for fuel, if its two
ends are burnt by the fire and the middle
is charred, is it fit for anything useful?
5 Nothing useful could be made from it,
even when whole; how much less is it
useful for making anything when burnt
and charred by fire!
6 The Lord GOD says: As the wood of
the vine among all kinds of wood from
the forest is useful only for burning, even
so I treat the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7 I have set my face against them. They
have escaped from the fire, but fire will
burn them up. Thus you will know that I
am the LORD when I set my face against
them,
8 and make the land a waste because
they have broken faith. This is the word
of the Lord GOD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, make Jerusalem see her
abominable conduct.
3 Tell her that these are the words of
the Lord GOD to her: Canaan is the land
of your ancestry and your birthplace;
your father was an Amorite, your mother
a Hittite.
16Ezekiel 16.4– 8
45
4 This is how you were treated when
you were born: at birth your navel-string
was not tied, you were not bathed in
water and rubbed with oil; no salt was
put on you, nor were you wrapped in
swaddling clothes.
5 No one cared enough for you to do
any of these things, or felt enough
compassion; you were thrown out on the
bare ground in your own filth on the day
you were born.
6 I came by and saw you kicking
helplessly as you lay in your blood; I
decreed that you should continue to live
in your blood.
7 I tended you like an evergreen plant
growing in the fields; you throve and
grew. You came to full womanhood;
your breasts became firm and your hair
grew, but you were still quite naked and
exposed.
8 I came by again and saw that you
were ripe for love. I spread the skirt
of my robe over you and covered your
naked body. I plighted my troth and
entered into a covenant with you, says
the Lord GOD, and you became mine.Ezekiel 16.9–16
46
9 Then I bathed you with water to wash
off the blood; I anointed you with oil.
10 I gave you robes of brocade and
sandals of dugong-hide; I fastened a
linen girdle round you and dressed you
in fine linen.
11 I adorned you with jewellery:
bracelets on your wrists, a chain round
your neck,
12 a ring in your nose, pendants in your
ears, and a splendid crown on your head.
13 You were adorned with gold and
silver, and clothed with linen, fine linen
and brocade. Fine flour and honey and
olive oil were your food; you became a
great beauty and rose to be a queen.
14 Your beauty was famed throughout
the world; it was perfect because of the
splendour I bestowed on you. This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
15 Relying on your beauty and exploiting
your fame, you played the harlot
and offered yourself freely to every
passer-by.
16 You used some of your clothes to
deck shrines in gay colours and there
you committed fornication.Ezekiel 16.17–24
47
17 You took the splendid gold and silver
jewellery that I had given you, and made
for yourself male images with which you
committed fornication.
18 You covered them with your robes of
brocade, and you offered up my oil and
my incense to them.
19 The food I had provided for you, the
fine flour, the oil, and the honey, you set
before them as an offering of soothing
odour. This is the word of the Lord GOD.
20 The sons and daughters whom you
had borne to me you took and sacrificed
to these images as their food. Was this
slaughtering of my children, this handing
them over and surrendering them to
your images, any less a sin than your
fornication?
21 (16:20)
22 With all your abominable fornication
you never recalled those early days when
you lay quite naked, kicking helplessly in
your blood.
23 Woe betide you! says the Lord GOD.
After all the evil you had done
24 you set up a couch for yourself and
erected a shrine in every open place.Ezekiel 16.25–31
48
25 You built your shrines at the top of
every street and debased your beauty,
offering your body to every passer-by in
countless acts of harlotry.
26 You committed fornication with your
lustful neighbours, the Egyptians, and
provoked me to anger by your repeated
harlotry.
27 I stretched out my hand against you
and reduced your territory. I gave you up
to the will of your enemies, the Philistine
women, who were disgusted by your
lewd conduct.
28 Still unsatisfied, you committed
fornication with the Assyrians, and still
were not satisfied.
29 You committed many acts of
fornication in Chaldaea, a land of
traders, and even with this you were not
satisfied.
30 How you anger me! says the Lord
GOD. You have done all this like the
headstrong harlot you are.
31 You have set up your couches at
the top of every street and erected
your shrines in every open place, but,
unlike the common prostitute, you have
scorned a fee.Ezekiel 16.32–38
49
32 You adulterous wife who receives
strangers rather than her husband!
33 All prostitutes receive presents; but
you give presents to all your lovers,
bribing them to come from far and wide
to commit fornication with you.
34 When you are so engaged you are
the very opposite of those other women:
no one runs after you, and you do not
receive a fee; you give one!
35 Listen, you harlot, to the word of the
LORD.
36 The Lord GOD says: Because of your
brazen excesses, exposing your naked
body in fornication with your lovers,
because of your abominable idols and
the slaughter of the children you have
offered to them,
37 I shall assemble all those lovers
whom you charmed, all whom you loved
and all whom you turned against. I shall
gather them in from all around against
you; I shall strip you before them, and
they will see you altogether naked.
38 I shall bring you to trial for adultery
and murder, and I shall give you over to
blood spilt in fury and jealousy.Ezekiel 16.39–44
50
39 When I hand you over to them,
they will demolish your couch and pull
down your shrine; they will strip off
your clothes, take away your splendid
jewellery, and leave you stark naked.
40 They will bring up a mob to punish
you; they will stone you and hack you to
pieces with their swords.
41 They will burn down your houses and
execute judgement on you in the sight of
many women. I shall put a stop to your
harlotry, and never again will you pay a
fee to your lovers.
42 Then I shall abate my fury, and my
jealousy will turn away from you. I shall
be calm and no longer be provoked to
anger.
43 You never called to mind the days of
your youth, but enraged me with all your
doings; I in turn brought retribution on
you for your conduct. This is the word of
the Lord GOD. Did you not commit these
obscenities, as well as all your other
abominations?
44 Everyone who quotes proverbs will
quote this one about you, Like mother,
like daughter.Ezekiel 16.45–50
51
45 You are a true daughter of a mother
who rejected her husband and children.
You are a true sister of your sisters who
rejected their husbands and children.
You are daughters of a Hittite mother
and an Amorite father.
46 Your elder sister was Samaria, who
lived with her daughters to the north of
you; your younger sister was Sodom,
who lived with her daughters to the
south.
47 Did you not behave as they did
and commit the same abominations?
Indeed you surpassed them in depraved
conduct.
48 As I live, says the Lord GOD, your
sister Sodom and her daughters never
behaved as you and your daughters have
done!
49 This was the iniquity of your sister
Sodom: she and her daughters had
the pride that goes with food in plenty,
comfort, and ease, yet she never helped
the poor in their need.
50 They grew haughty and committed
what was abominable in my sight, and I
swept them away, as you are aware.Ezekiel 16.51–55
52
51 Nor did Samaria commit half the
sins of which you have been guilty; you
have committed more abominations
than she. All the abominations you have
committed have made your sister look
innocent.
52 It is you that must bear the
humiliation, for your sins have pleaded
your sisters cause; your conduct is so
much more abominable than theirs that
they appear innocent in comparison.
Now you must bear your shame and
humiliation and make your sisters look
innocent.
53 I shall restore the fortunes of Sodom
and her daughters and of Samaria and
her daughters (and I shall restore yours
at the same time).
54 When you bring them comfort, you
will bear your shame and be disgraced
for all you have done.
55 After your sister Sodom and her
daughters become what they were of
old, and when your sister Samaria and
her daughters become what they were
of old, then you and your daughters will
be restored likewise.Ezekiel 16.56–61
53
56 Did you not speak contemptuously of
your sister Sodom in the days of your
pride,
57 before your wickedness was exposed?
Even so now you are despised by the
daughters of Aram and all those nations
around them, and the daughters of
Philistia round about who also despise
you.
58 You must bear the consequences of
your lewd and abominable conduct. This
is the word of the LORD.
59 The Lord GOD says: I shall treat
you as you have deserved, because you
violated an oath and made light of a
covenant.
60 But I shall call to mind the covenant
I made with you when you were young,
and I shall establish with you a covenant
which will last for ever.
61 You will remember your past conduct
and feel ashamed when you receive your
sisters, the elder and the younger. I shall
give them to you as daughters, though
they are not included in my covenant
with you.Ezekiel 16.62–17.6
54
62 Thus I shall establish my covenant
with you, and you will know that I am
the LORD.
63 You will remember, and will be so
ashamed and humiliated that you will
never open your mouth again, once
I have pardoned you for all you have
done. This is the word of the Lord GOD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, pose this riddle, expound this
parable to the Israelites.
3 Tell them that these are the words of
the Lord GOD: A great eagle with broad
wings and long pinions, in full plumage,
richly patterned, came to Lebanon. He
took the very top of a cedar tree,
4 plucked its highest twig; he carried it
off to a land of traders, and planted it in
a city of merchants.
5 Then he took a native seed and put it
in a prepared plot; he set it like a willow,
a shoot beside abundant water.
6 It sprouted and became a vine,
sprawling low along the ground and
bending its boughs towards him with its
roots growing beneath him. So it became
17Ezekiel 17.7–12
55
a vine; it branched out and sent forth
shoots.
7 But there was another great eagle
with broad wings and thick plumage; and
this vine gave its roots a twist towards
him; from the bed where it was planted,
seeking drink, it pushed out its trailing
boughs towards him,
8 though it had been set in good ground
beside abundant water that it might
branch out and be fruitful, and become a
noble vine.
9 Tell them that the Lord GOD says: Will
such a vine flourish? Will not its roots be
torn up and its fruit stripped off, and all
its freshly sprouted leaves wither, until it
is uprooted and carried away with little
effort and a small force?
10 If it is transplanted, will it flourish?
Will it not be utterly shrivelled, as though
by the touch of the east wind, on the
bed where it ought to sprout?
11 This word of the LORD came to me:
12 Say to that rebellious people: Have
you no idea what all this means? The
king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took
its king and those in high office, and
brought them back with him to Babylon.Ezekiel 17.13–18
56
13 He chose a prince of the royal line
and made a treaty with him, putting him
on his oath. He carried away the chief
men of the country,
14 so that it should become a humble
kingdom, submissive, ready to observe
the treaty and keep it in force.
15 But the prince rebelled against him
and sent envoys to Egypt with a request
for horses and a large force of troops.
Will such a man be successful? Will he
escape destruction if he acts in this
way? Can he violate a treaty and escape
unpunished?
16 As I live, says the Lord GOD, I swear
that he will die in Babylon, in the land of
the king who put him on the throne, the
king whose oath he disregarded, whose
treaty he violated.
17 No large army will come from
Pharaoh, no great force to be a
protection for him in battle, when
siege-ramps are thrown up and towers
are built for the destruction of many.
18 Because he violated a treaty and
disregarded his oath, because he
submitted, and yet did all these things,
he will not escape.Ezekiel 17.19–24
57
19 The Lord GOD says: As I live, he has
made light of the oath sworn in my name
and has violated the covenant he made
with me. For this I shall bring retribution
upon him.
20 Because he has broken faith with
me I shall throw my net over him, and
he will be caught in the meshes; I shall
carry him to Babylon and bring him to
judgement there.
21 The picked troops in all his squadrons
will fall by the sword; those who are left
will be scattered to all the winds. Thus
you will know that it is I, the LORD, who
have spoken.
22 The Lord GOD says: I, too, shall take
a slip from the lofty crown of the cedar
and set it in the soil; I shall pluck a
tender shoot from the topmost branch
and plant it on a high and lofty mountain,
23 the highest mountain in Israel. It
will put out branches, bear its fruit, and
become a noble cedar. Birds of every
kind will roost under it, perching in the
shelter of its boughs.
24 All the trees of the countryside will
know that it is I, the LORD, who bring
low the tall tree and raise the lowly treeEzekiel 18.1– 7
58
high, who shrivel up the green tree and
make the shrivelled tree put forth buds.
I, the LORD, have spoken; I shall do it.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 What do you all mean by repeating
this proverb in the land of Israel: Parents
eat sour grapes, and their children's
teeth are set on edge?
3 As I live, says the Lord GOD, this
proverb will never again be used by you
in Israel.
4 Every living soul belongs to me;
parent and child alike are mine. It is the
person who sins that will die.
5 Consider the man who is righteous
and does what is just and right.
6 He never feasts at mountain shrines,
never looks up to idols worshipped in
Israel, never dishonours another man's
wife, never approaches a menstruous
woman;
7 he oppresses no one, he returns
the debtor's pledge, he never commits
robbery; he gives his food to the hungry
and clothes to those who have none.
18Ezekiel 18.8–15
59
8 He never lends either at discount or at
interest, but shuns injustice and deals
fairly between one person and another.
9 He conforms to my statutes and
loyally observes my laws. Such a one
is righteous: he will live, says the Lord
GOD.
10 He may have a son who is given to
violence and bloodshed, one who turns
his back on these commandments;
11 obeying none of them, he feasts at
mountain shrines, dishonours another
man's wife,
12 oppresses the poor in their need; he
commits robbery, he does not return the
debtor's pledge, he looks up to idols, and
joins in abominable rites;
13 he lends both at discount and at
interest. Such a one will not live;
because he has committed all these
abominations he must die. His blood be
on his own head!
14 This person in turn may have a son
who sees all his father's sins, but in spite
of seeing them commits none of them.
15 He never feasts at mountain shrines,
never looks up to the idols worshipped inEzekiel 18.16–21
60
Israel, never dishonours another man's
wife,
16 oppresses no one, takes no pledge,
does not rob; he gives his food to the
hungry and clothes to those who have
none;
17 he shuns injustice and never lends
either at discount or at interest. He
keeps my laws and conforms to my
statutes. Such a one is not to die for his
father's wrongdoing; he will live.
18 If his father has been guilty of
oppression and robbery and lived an evil
life in the community, and died because
of his iniquity,
19 you may ask, Why is the son not
punished for his father's iniquity?
Because he has always done what is just
and right and has been careful to obey
all my laws, he will live.
20 It is the person who sins that will die;
a son will not bear responsibility for his
father's guilt, nor a father for his son's.
The righteous person will have his own
righteousness placed to his account, and
the wicked person his own wickedness.
21 If someone who is wicked renounces
all his sinful ways and keeps all my laws,Ezekiel 18.22–27
61
doing what is just and right, he will live;
he will not die.
22 None of the offences he has
committed will be remembered against
him; because of his righteous conduct
he will live.
23 Have I any desire for the death of
a wicked person? says the Lord GOD.
Is not my desire rather that he should
mend his ways and live?
24 If someone who is righteous turns
from his righteous ways and commits
every kind of abomination that the
wicked practise, is he to do this and live?
No, none of his former righteousness will
be remembered in his favour; because
he has been faithless and has sinned, he
must die.
25 You say that the Lord acts without
principle? Listen, you Israelites! It is not
I who act without principle; it is you.
26 If a righteous man turns from his
righteousness, takes to evil ways, and
dies, it is because of these evil ways that
he dies.
27 Again, if a wicked man gives up his
wicked ways and does what is just and
right, he preserves his life;Ezekiel 18.28–19.3
62
28 he has seen his offences and turned
his back on them all, and so he will not
die; he will live.
29 The Lord acts without principle, say
the Israelites. No, it is you, Israel, that
acts without principle, not I.
30 Therefore I shall judge every one of
you Israelites on his record, says the
Lord GOD. Repent, renounce all your
offences, or your iniquity will be your
downfall.
31 Throw off the load of your past
misdeeds; get yourselves a new heart
and a new spirit. Why should you
Israelites die?
32 I have no desire for the death of
anyone. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
1 Raise a dirge over the rulers of
Israel
2 and say: What a lioness was your
mother among the lions! She made her
lair among the young lions and reared
her cubs.
3 One of her cubs she singled out; he
grew into a young lion, he learnt to tear
his prey, he devoured men.
19Ezekiel 19.4–11
63
4 Then the nations raised a shout at
him; he was caught in their pit, and they
dragged him off with hooks to Egypt.
5 When she saw that her hope in him
was disappointed and dashed, she took
another of her cubs and made a young
lion of him.
6 He prowled among the lions and acted
like a young lion. He learnt to tear his
prey, he devoured men;
7 he broke down their palaces, laid their
cities in ruins. The land and all in it were
aghast at the sound of his roaring.
8 From the regions all around the
nations raised a hue and cry; they cast
their net over him and he was caught in
their pit.
9 With hooks they drew him into a cage
and brought him to the king of Babylon;
he was put in prison that his roar might
never again be heard on the mountains
of Israel.
10 Your mother was a vine planted
by the waterside. It grew fruitful and
luxuriant, for there was water in plenty.
11 It had stout branches, sceptres for
those who bear rule. It grew tall, finding
its way through the foliage; it wasEzekiel 19.12–20.4
64
conspicuous for its height and many
boughs.
12 But it was torn up in anger and
thrown to the ground; the east wind
blighted it, its fruit was blown off, its
strong branches were blighted, and fire
burnt it.
13 Now it is transplanted in the
wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land;
14 fire bursts forth from its own
branches and burns up its shoots. It has
no strong branch any more, no sceptre
for those who bear rule. This is a lament
and it has passed into use as such.
1 ON the tenth day of the fifth
month in the seventh year, some
of the elders of Israel came to consult
the LORD and were sitting with me.
2 Then this word of the LORD came to
me:
3 O man, say to the elders of Israel: The
Lord GOD says: Do you come to consult
me? As I live, I refuse to be consulted by
you. This is the word of the Lord GOD.
4 Bring a charge against them, O man!
Tell them of the abominations of their
forefathers
20Ezekiel 20.5– 9
65
5 and say to them: The Lord GOD
says: On the day I chose Israel, with
uplifted hand I bound myself by oath to
the descendants of Jacob and revealed
myself to them in Egypt, declaring: I am
the LORD your God.
6 That day I swore with hand uplifted
that I would bring them out of Egypt
into the land I had sought out for them,
a land flowing with milk and honey, the
fairest of all lands.
7 I told every one of them to cast away
the loathsome things to which they
looked up, and not to defile themselves
with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD
your God, I said.
8 But in rebellion against me they
refused to listen, and not one of them
cast away the loathsome things to which
he looked up or forsook the idols of
Egypt. I resolved to pour out my wrath
and exhaust my anger on them in Egypt.
9 But then I acted for the honour of my
name, that it might not be profaned in
the sight of the nations among whom
Israel was living: I revealed myself to
them by bringing Israel out of Egypt.Ezekiel 20.10–16
66
10 I brought them out of Egypt and led
them into the wilderness.
11 There I gave my statutes to them and
taught them my laws; it is by keeping
them that mortals have life.
12 Further, I gave them my sabbaths to
serve as a sign between us, so that they
would know that I am the LORD who
sanctified them.
13 But the Israelites rebelled against me
in the wilderness; they did not conform
to my statutes, they rejected my laws,
though it is by keeping them that mortals
have life, and they totally desecrated
my sabbaths. I resolved to pour out
my wrath on them in the wilderness to
destroy them.
14 But then I acted for the honour of my
name, that it might not be profaned in
the sight of the nations who had seen
me bring them out.
15 However, in the wilderness I swore
to them with uplifted hand that I would
not bring them into the land I had given
them, that land flowing with milk and
honey, the fairest of all lands.
16 They loved to follow idols of their
own, so they rejected my laws, theyEzekiel 20.17–22
67
would not conform to my statutes, and
they desecrated my sabbaths.
17 Yet I pitied them too much to destroy
them and did not make an end of them
in the wilderness.
18 I warned their children in the
wilderness not to conform to the rules
and usages of their fathers, nor to defile
themselves with their idols.
19 I am the LORD your God, I said; you
must conform to my statutes, you must
observe my laws and act according to
them.
20 You must keep my sabbaths holy, and
they will become a sign between us; so
you will know that I am the LORD your
God.
21 But those children rebelled against
me; they did not conform to my statutes
or observe my laws, though obedience
to them would have given life. Moreover
they desecrated my sabbaths. Again I
resolved to pour out my wrath and vent
my anger on them in the wilderness.
22 But I stayed my hand. I acted for the
honour of my name, so that it might not
be profaned in the sight of the nationsEzekiel 20.23–28
68
who had seen me bring them out of
Egypt.
23 However, in the wilderness I swore
to them with uplifted hand that I would
disperse them among the nations and
scatter them over the earth,
24 because they had disobeyed my laws,
rejected my statutes, desecrated my
sabbaths, and had regard only for the
idols of their forefathers.
25 I even imposed on them statutes that
were malign and laws which would not
lead to life.
26 I let them defile themselves with gifts
to idols; I made them surrender their
eldest sons to them so that I might fill
them with revulsion. Thus they would
know that I am the LORD.
27 Speak therefore, O man, to the
Israelites; say to them: The Lord GOD
says: Once again your forefathers reviled
me and broke faith with me:
28 when I brought them into the land
which I had sworn with uplifted hand to
give them, they noted every hilltop and
every leafy tree, and there they offered
their sacrifices, there they presented the
gifts which roused my anger, there theyEzekiel 20.29–34
69
set out their offerings of soothing odour
and poured out their drink-offerings.
29 I asked them: What is this bamah to
which you go? And bamah has been the
name for a shrine ever since.
30 So tell the Israelites: The Lord GOD
says: Are you defiling yourselves as your
forefathers did, and lusting after their
loathsome gods?
31 You are defiling yourselves to this
very day with all your idols when you
bring your gifts and pass your children
through the fire. How then can I let you
consult me, men of Israel? As I live, says
the Lord GOD, I refuse to be consulted
by you.
32 When you say to yourselves, Let us
become like the nations and tribes of
other lands and worship wood and stone,
you are thinking of something that can
never be.
33 As I live, says the Lord GOD, I shall
reign over you with a strong hand, with
arm outstretched and wrath outpoured.
34 By my strong hand, an outstretched
arm, and outpoured wrath I shall bring
you out from the peoples and gather youEzekiel 20.35–40
70
from the lands where you have been
dispersed.
35 I shall bring you into the Wilderness
of the Peoples; there I shall confront you
and bring you to judgement.
36 Even as I did in the wilderness
of Egypt against your forefathers, so
against you I shall state my case. This is
the word of the Lord GOD.
37 I shall make you pass under the rod,
counting you as you enter.
38 I shall purge you of those who revolt
and rebel against me. I shall take them
out of the land where they now live, but
they will not set foot on the soil of Israel.
Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
39 Now, you Israelites, the Lord GOD
says: Go, each one of you, and serve
your idols! But in days to come I shall
punish you for your disobedience to me,
and no more will you desecrate my holy
name with your gifts and your idolatries.
40 But on my holy mountain, the lofty
mountain of Israel, says the Lord GOD,
there in the land all the Israelites will
serve me. There I shall accept them;
there I shall require your gifts and yourEzekiel 20.41–46
71
choicest offerings, with all else that you
consecrate to me.
41 I shall accept you when you make
offerings with their soothing odour, after
I have brought you out from the peoples
and gathered you from the lands where
you have been dispersed. I alone shall
have your worship, and the nations will
witness it.
42 You will know that I am the LORD,
when I bring you home to the soil of
Israel, to the land which I swore with
uplifted hand to give your forefathers.
43 There you will remember your past
conduct and all the acts by which you
defiled yourselves, and you will loathe
yourselves for all the wickedness you
have committed.
44 You will know that I am the LORD,
when I deal with you Israelites, not as
your wicked ways and your vicious deeds
deserve, but as the honour of my name
demands. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
45 This word of the LORD came to me:
46 O man, turn and face towards the
south and utter your words towards it;
prophesy to the scrubland of the Negeb.Ezekiel 20.47–21.4
72
47 Say to it: Listen to the word of the
LORD. The Lord GOD says: I am about to
kindle a fire in you, and it will consume
all the wood, green and dry alike. Its
fiery flame will not be put out, but from
the Negeb northwards everyone will be
scorched by it.
48 Everyone will see that it is I, the
LORD, who have set it ablaze; it will not
be put out.
49 Ah Lord GOD, I cried; they are always
saying of me, He deals only in figures of
speech.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, turn and face towards
Jerusalem, and utter your words against
her sanctuary; prophesy against the land
of Israel.
3 Say to that land: The LORD says: I am
against you; I shall draw my sword from
the scabbard and make away with both
righteous and wicked from among you.
4 It is because I intend to make away
with righteous and wicked alike that my
sword will be drawn from the scabbard
against everyone, from the Negeb
northwards.
21Ezekiel 21.5–12
73
5 All shall know that I, the LORD, have
drawn my sword; it will never again be
sheathed.
6 Groan while they look on, O man,
groan bitterly until you collapse.
7 When they ask why you are groaning,
say, Because what I have heard is about
to come. All hearts will melt, all hands
will hang limp, all courage will fail,
all knees will turn to water. See, it is
coming; it is here! This is the word of the
Lord GOD.
8 The LORD said to me:
9 Prophesy, O man, and say: This is the
word of the LORD: A sword, a sword is
sharpened and burnished,
10 sharpened to kill and kill again,
burnished to flash like lightning. (Look,
the rod is brandished, my son, to defy all
wooden idols!)
11 The sword is given to be burnished
ready for the hand to grasp. The sword
is sharpened, it is burnished, ready to be
given into the slayer's hand.
12 Cry aloud and wail, O man; for it falls
on my people, and on all Israel's rulers
who are delivered over to the sword andEzekiel 21.13–19
74
are slain with my people. Therefore slap
your thigh in remorse.
13 (When the test comes, what if the
rod does not in truth defy?) This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
14 But you, O man, prophesy and strike
your hands together; swing the sword
twice, thrice: it is the sword of slaughter,
the great sword of slaughter whirling
about them.
15 That their hearts may be fearful and
many may stumble and fall, I have set
the threat of the sword at all their gates,
the threat of the sword flashing like
lightning and drawn to kill.
16 Be sharpened, turn right; be
unsheathed, turn left, wherever your
point is aimed.
17 I, too, shall strike my hands together
and abate my anger. I, the LORD, have
spoken.
18 This word of the LORD came to me:
19 O man, trace out two roads by which
the sword of the king of Babylon may
come, both starting from the same land.
Then make a signpost for the point
where the highway forks.Ezekiel 21.20–25
75
20 Mark a road for the sword to come to
the Ammonite city of Rabbah, and a road
to Judah, with Jerusalem at its heart.
21 At the parting of the ways where the
road divides, the king of Babylon will
halt to take the omens. He will cast lots
with arrows, consult household gods,
and inspect the livers of beasts.
22 The arrow marked Jerusalem will fall
at his right hand: here, then, he will give
the command for slaughter and sound
the battle cry, set battering-rams against
the gates, cast up siege-ramps, and
build watch-towers.
23 The people will think that the auguries
are groundless, the king of Babylon will
remind me of their wrongdoing, and they
will fall into his hand.
24 Therefore the Lord GOD says:
Because you have kept me mindful of
your wrongdoing by your open rebellion,
and your sins have been revealed in
everything you do, because you have
kept yourselves in my mind, you will fall
into the enemy's hand.
25 And you, impious and wicked ruler of
Israel, your fate has come upon you in
the hour of final punishment.Ezekiel 21.26–32
76
26 The Lord GOD says: Off with the
diadem! Away with the crown! All is
overturned; raise the low and bring
down the high.
27 Ruin! Ruin! I shall bring about such
ruin as never was, until one comes who
is the rightful ruler; and I shall install
him.
28 O MAN, prophesy and say: The Lord
GOD says to the Ammonites and to their
shameful god: A sword, a sword drawn
for slaughter, burnished for destruction
to flash like lightning!
29 Your visions are false, your auguries
a lie, which bid you bring it down upon
the necks of the impious and the wicked;
their fate will come upon them in the
hour of final punishment.
30 Return the sword to the sheath. I
shall judge you in the place where you
were born, the land of your origin.
31 I shall pour out my wrath on you; I
shall fan my blazing anger over you. I
shall hand you over to barbarous men,
skilled in destruction.
32 You will become fuel for fire, your
blood will be shed within the land andEzekiel 22.1– 7
77
you will leave no memory behind. I, the
LORD, have spoken.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, will you bring a charge against
her? Will you charge the murderous city
and bring home to her all her abominable
deeds?
3 Say to her: The Lord GOD has said:
Woe betide the city that sheds blood
within her walls and brings her fate on
herself, the city that makes idols for
herself and is defiled by them!
4 You are guilty because of the blood
you have shed, you are defiled because
of the idols you have made. You
have shortened your days by this and
hastened your end. This is why I exposed
you to the contempt of the nations and
the mockery of every country.
5 Lands both far and near will taunt
you with your infamy and monstrous
disorder.
6 In you all the rulers of Israel have
used their power to shed blood;
7 in you fathers and mothers have been
treated contemptuously, aliens have
22Ezekiel 22.8–14
78
been oppressed, the fatherless and the
widow have been wronged.
8 You have despised what I hold sacred,
and desecrated my sabbaths.
9 In you, Jerusalem, perjurers have
worked to procure bloodshed; in you
are men who have feasted at mountain
shrines and have committed lewdness.
10 In you men have exposed their
fathers nakedness; they have violated
women who were menstruating;
11 they have committed an outrage with
their neighbours' wives and have lewdly
defiled their own daughters-in-law; they
have ravished their sisters, their own
fathers' daughters.
12 In you people have accepted bribes
to shed blood. You have exacted discount
and interest, and have oppressed your
fellows for gain. You have committed
apostasy. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
13 See, I strike with my clenched fist
at your ill-gotten gains and at the
bloodshed within your walls.
14 Will your courage and strength
endure when I deal with you? I, the
LORD, have spoken and I shall act.Ezekiel 22.15–24
79
15 I shall disperse you among the
nations and scatter you over the earth to
rid you of your defilement.
16 I shall sift you in the sight of the
nations, and you will know that I am the
LORD.
17 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
18 O man, to me all Israelites are but an
alloy, their silver debased with copper,
tin, iron, and lead.
19 Therefore, these are the words of the
Lord GOD: Because you are all alloyed, I
shall gather you into Jerusalem,
20 as silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin
are gathered into a crucible, where fire is
blown to full heat to melt them. So shall
I gather you in my anger and wrath, put
you in it, and melt you;
21 I shall gather you in Jerusalem and
fan the fire of my anger until you are
melted.
22 As silver is melted in a crucible so will
you be melted, and you will know that I,
the LORD, have poured out my anger on
you.
23 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
24 O man, say to Jerusalem: You are
like a land on which no rain has fallen,Ezekiel 22.25–29
80
no shower has come in the time of my
wrath.
25 The princes within her are like lions
growling as they tear their prey. They
devour the people, and seize their wealth
and valuables; they make widows of
many women within her.
26 Her priests give rulings which violate
my law, and profane what is sacred to
me. They do not distinguish between
sacred and profane, and enforce no
distinction between clean and unclean.
They disregard my sabbaths, and I am
dishonoured among them.
27 The city's leaders are like wolves
tearing their prey, shedding blood and
destroying people's lives to obtain
ill-gotten gain.
28 Her prophets whitewash over the
cracks, their vision is false and their
divination a lie. They say, This is the
word of the Lord GOD, when the LORD
has not spoken.
29 The common people resort to
oppression and robbery; they ill-treat
the unfortunate and the poor, they
oppress the alien and deny him justice.Ezekiel 22.30–23.6
81
30 I looked among them for a man who
would build a barricade in the breach and
withstand me, to avert the destruction of
the land; but I found no such person.
31 I poured out my wrath on them and
utterly consumed them in my blazing
anger. Thus I brought on them the
punishment they had deserved. This is
the word of the Lord GOD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, there were once two women,
daughters of the same mother,
3 who while they were still girls played
the whore in Egypt. There they let
their breasts be fondled and their virgin
bosoms be pressed.
4 The elder was named Oholah, her
sister Oholibah. They became mine
and gave birth to sons and daughters.
Oholah is Samaria, Oholibah Jerusalem.
5 Though Oholah owed me obedience
she played the whore and was infatuated
with her Assyrian lovers, officers
6 in blue, viceroys and governors, all of
them handsome young men riding on
horseback.
23Ezekiel 23.7–14
82
7 She played the whore with all of them,
the flower of Assyrian manhood; and
because of her lust for all their idols she
was defiled.
8 She never gave up the ways she
had learnt in Egypt, where men had
lain with her while she was still young,
had pressed her virgin bosom and
overwhelmed her with their fornication.
9 So I abandoned her to her lovers,
the Assyrians, with whom she was
infatuated.
10 They ravished her, they took away
her sons and daughters, and they put
her to the sword. She became notorious
among women, and judgement was
executed on her.
11 Oholibah, her sister, saw it, but she
surpassed her sister in lust and outdid
her in playing the whore.
12 She too was infatuated with
Assyrians, viceroys and governors, all
handsome officers in full dress and riding
on horseback.
13 I saw that she too had let herself be
defiled. Both had gone the same way,
14 but she carried her fornication to
greater lengths: she saw male figuresEzekiel 23.15–21
83
carved on the wall, sculptured forms of
Chaldaeans picked out in vermilion,
15 with belts round their waists and
flowing turbans on their heads. All had
the appearance of high Babylonian
officers, natives of Chaldaea.
16 When she set eyes on them she
was infatuated, and sent messengers to
Chaldaea for them.
17 The Babylonians came to her to share
her bed, and defiled her with fornication;
she was defiled by them until her love
turned to revulsion.
18 When she made no secret that she
was a whore and let herself be ravished,
I recoiled with revulsion from her as I
recoiled from her sister.
19 Remembering how in her youth she
had played the whore in Egypt, she
played the whore over and over again.
20 She was infatuated with their male
prostitutes, whose members were like
those of donkeys and whose seed came
in floods like that of stallions.
21 So, Oholibah, you relived the
lewdness of your girlhood in Egypt when
you let your bosom be pressed and your
breasts fondled.Ezekiel 23.22–26
84
22 The Lord GOD has said: I shall rouse
against you, Oholibah, those lovers of
yours who have filled you with revulsion,
and bring them against you from every
side:
23 the Babylonians, all the Chaldaeans
from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and with
them all the Assyrians, handsome
young men, viceroys and governors,
commanders and officers, all on
horseback.
24 They will advance against you with
war-horses, with chariots and wagons,
with a host drawn from the nations,
armed with shield, buckler, and helmet;
they will beset you on every side. I
shall give them authority to judge, and
they will use that authority to execute
judgement on you.
25 I shall turn my jealous wrath against
you, and they will bring their fury to bear
on you. They will cut off your nose and
ears, and those of you left will fall by
the sword. They will take your sons and
daughters, and those of you left will end
in flames.
26 They will strip you of your clothes
and take away your finery.Ezekiel 23.27–33
85
27 So I shall put a stop to your lewdness
and the harlotry which you first learnt in
Egypt. You will never cast longing eyes
on such things again, never remember
Egypt any more.
28 The Lord GOD says: I am handing
you over to those whom you hate, those
who have filled you with revulsion;
29 and they will bring their fury to bear
on you. They will take all you have
earned and leave you stark naked;
the body with which you have played
the whore will be ravished. It is your
lewdness and your fornication
30 that have brought this on you; it is
because you adopted heathen ways,
played the whore, and became defiled
with idols.
31 As you have followed in your sister's
footsteps, I shall put her cup into your
hand.
32 The Lord GOD says: You will drink
from your sister's cup, a cup deep and
wide, charged to the very brim with
mockery and scorn.
33 It will be full of drunkenness and
grief, a cup of uttermost ruin, the cup of
your sister Samaria;Ezekiel 23.34–40
86
34 you will drink it to the dregs, and
then gnaw it into shreds while you tear
your breasts. This is my sentence, says
the Lord GOD.
35 The Lord GOD says: Because you
have forsaken me and cast me behind
your back, you will have to bear the guilt
of your lewdness and fornication.
36 The LORD said to me, O man, will
you bring a charge against Oholah and
Oholibah? Then tax them with their vile
offences.
37 They have committed adultery, and
there is blood on their hands. They have
committed adultery with their idols and
offered to them as food the children they
had borne me.
38 Here is another thing they have done
to me: they have polluted my sanctuary
and desecrated my sabbaths.
39 They came into my sanctuary and
desecrated it by slaughtering their sons
as an offering to their idols; this they did
in my house.
40 Then also they would send for men
from a far-off country, who would come
at the messenger's bidding. For themEzekiel 23.41–47
87
you bathed your body, painted your
eyes, decked yourself in your finery,
41 sat yourself on a splendid couch, and
had a table placed before it on which you
laid my incense and oil.
42 There was loud shouting from a
carefree crowd. Besides ordinary folk,
Sabaeans were there, brought in from
the desert; they put bracelets on the
harlots arms and beautiful garlands on
their heads.
43 I thought: Ah, that woman, grown
old in adultery! Now they will commit
fornication with her -- her of all women!
44 They resorted to her as to a
prostitute; they resorted to Oholah and
Oholibah, those lewd women.
45 Upright men will condemn them for
their adultery and bloodshed; they are
adulterous, and have blood on their
hands.
46 The Lord GOD says: Bring up a mob
to punish them; give them over to terror
and pillage.
47 Let the mob stone them and hack
them to pieces with their swords, kill
their sons and daughters, and burn down
their houses.Ezekiel 23.48–24.6
88
48 In this way I shall put an end to
lewdness in the land, and all the women
will take warning not to follow their lewd
example.
49 When they punish you for your lewd
conduct and you pay the penalty for your
idolatries, you will know that I am the
Lord GOD.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me on the tenth day of the tenth
month in the ninth year:
2 O man, write down as the name for
this special day: This day the king of
Babylon besieged Jerusalem.
3 Sing a song of derision to this body
of rebels; say to them: These are the
words of the Lord GOD: Set a cauldron
on the fire, set it on and pour in water.
4 Into it collect the pieces, every choice
piece, fill it with leg and shoulder, the
best of the bones;
5 take the pick of the flock. Pile the
wood underneath; seethe the stew and
boil the bones in it.
6 The Lord GOD says: Woe betide the
city running with blood, woe to the pot
green with corrosion which will never
24Ezekiel 24.7–13
89
come off! Empty it, piece after piece,
with no lot cast for any of them.
7 The city had blood in her midst and
she poured it on the bare rock; it was
not shed on the ground for the dust to
cover it.
8 I have spilt her blood on the bare
rock so that it cannot be covered; it will
arouse anger and call out for vengeance.
9 The Lord GOD says: Woe betide the
city running with blood! I myself shall
make a great fire-pit.
10 Fill it with logs, kindle the fire; make
an end of the meat, pour out all the
broth and the bones with it.
11 Then set the pot empty on the
coals so that its copper may be heated
red-hot, that the impurities in it may be
melted and the corrosion burnt off.
12 Though you exhaust yourself with
your efforts the corrosion is so deep it
will not come off; only fire will rid it of
corrosion.
13 When in your filthy lewdness I wished
to cleanse you, you did not become
clean, nor will you ever be clean again
until I have spent my anger against you.Ezekiel 24.14–21
90
14 I, the LORD, have spoken: The time
is coming and I shall act. I shall not
condone or pity or relent. You will be
judged by your conduct and by what you
have done. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
15 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
16 O man, I am taking from you at one
stroke the dearest thing you have, but
you are not to wail or weep or give way
to tears.
17 Suppress your grief, and observe
no mourning for the dead. Wrap your
turban on your head and put on your
sandals. You are not to veil your beard
in mourning or eat the bread of sorrow.
18 I spoke to the people in the morning.
That evening my wife died, and next
morning I did as I had been commanded.
19 The people asked me what meaning
my actions had for them.
20 I answered, This word of the LORD
came to me:
21 Tell the Israelites: The Lord GOD
has said: I am about to desecrate my
sanctuary, which has been your strong
boast, the delight of your eyes, and
your heart's desire, and the sons andEzekiel 24.22–25.1
91
daughters you have left behind will fall
by the sword.
22 You are to do as I have done, I
said: you are not to cover your beard in
mourning or eat the bread of sorrow.
23 Your turbans are to be on your heads
and your sandals on your feet; you are
not to wail or weep. Because of your
wickedness you will pine away, groaning
to each other.
24 Ezekiel will be a sign to warn you,
says the LORD, and you are to do as he
has done. When judgement befalls you,
you will know that I am the Lord GOD.
25 Now, O man, I am taking from
them at that time the stronghold whose
beauty so gladdened them, the delight
of their eyes, their heart's desire, and I
am taking their sons and daughters.
26 When a fugitive then comes and
brings the news to you,
27 you will recover the power of speech
and, no longer dumb, you will speak with
the fugitive. So you will be a warning to
the people, and they will know that I am
the LORD.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
25Ezekiel 25.2– 8
92
2 O man, face towards the Ammonites
and prophesy against them.
3 Say this to them: Listen to the word
of the Lord GOD. He says: Because you
cried Hurrah! when my holy place was
desecrated, when Israel's land was laid
waste, and the people of Judah sent into
exile,
4 I am giving you into the possession of
tribes from the east. They will pitch their
tents and establish their camps among
you; they will eat your crops and drink
your milk.
5 I shall turn Rabbah into a camel
pasture and Ammon into a sheep-walk.
Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
6 These are the words of the Lord GOD:
Because you clapped your hands and
stamped your feet and exulted over the
land of Israel with spiteful contempt,
7 I shall stretch out my hand over you
and give you up to be plundered by the
nations. I shall cut you off from other
peoples, destroy you in every land, and
bring you to ruin. Thus you will know
that I am the LORD.
8 The Lord GOD says: Because Moab
said, Judah is like all other nations,Ezekiel 25.9–15
93
9 I shall expose the flank of Moab
and from one end to the other lay
open its towns, the glory of the land:
Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and
Kiriathaim.
10 I shall give Moab and Ammon into
the possession of tribes from the east,
so that all memory of the Ammonites will
be blotted out among the nations,
11 and so that I may execute judgement
upon Moab. Thus they will know that I
am the LORD.
12 The Lord GOD says: Because Edom
exacted harsh revenge on Judah and by
so doing incurred lasting guilt,
13 I shall stretch my hand out over
Edom, says the Lord GOD, and destroy
both people and animals in it, laying
waste the land from Teman as far as
Dedan; they will fall by the sword.
14 I shall wreak my vengeance on Edom
through my people Israel. They will
deal with Edom as my anger and fury
demand, and it will feel my vengeance.
This is the word of the Lord GOD.
15 The Lord GOD says: Because the
Philistines have resorted to revenge,
avenging themselves with spitefulEzekiel 25.16–26.5
94
contempt, and destroying to satisfy an
age-long enmity,
16 I shall stretch out my hand over the
Philistines, says the Lord GOD. I shall
wipe out the Kerethites and destroy the
other dwellers by the sea.
17 I shall take mighty vengeance upon
them and punish them in my fury. When
I exact my vengeance, they will know
that I am the LORD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me on the first day of the first
month in the eleventh year:
2 O man, since Tyre has said of
Jerusalem, Aha! She who was the
gateway of the nations is broken, her
gates lie open before me; I prosper, she
lies in ruin,
3 the Lord GOD says: I am against you,
Tyre! As the sea raises up its waves, so
shall I raise up many nations against
you.
4 They will destroy the walls of Tyre and
overthrow her towers. I shall scrape the
soil off her and leave her only bare rock;
5 she will be an island where nets are
spread to dry. This is my word, says the
26Ezekiel 26.6–11
95
Lord GOD. She will become the prey of
nations,
6 and her daughters on the mainland
will be slain. Then they will know that I
am the LORD.
7 The Lord GOD says: From the
north I am bringing against Tyre King
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, king of
kings. He will come with horses and
chariots, cavalry, and a great force of
infantry.
8 He will put to the sword your
daughters on the mainland. He will set
up siege-towers and cast up siege-ramps
against you, and raise a screen of shields
facing you.
9 He will launch his battering-rams on
your walls and break down your towers
with his axes.
10 Dust will cover you from his
innumerable cavalry. At the thunder of
the horses and of the chariot wheels
your walls will shake when he enters
your gates as though entering a city that
is breached.
11 All your streets will be trampled by
the hoofs of his horses. He will put yourEzekiel 26.12–17
96
people to the sword, and bring your
strong pillars to the ground.
12 Your wealth will become spoil, your
merchandise will be plundered. Your
walls will be levelled, and your fine
houses pulled down; the stones, timber,
and rubble will be dumped in the sea.
13 I shall silence the chorus of your
songs, and the sound of your harps will
be heard no more.
14 I shall make you a bare rock, a place
where nets are spread to dry. You will
never be rebuilt. I, the LORD, have
spoken. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
15 THE Lord GOD says to Tyre: How
the coasts and islands will shake at
the sound of your downfall, while the
wounded groan and slaughter prevails in
your midst!
16 Then the sea-kings will descend from
their thrones, lay aside their cloaks, and
strip off their brocaded robes. They will
put on loincloths and sit on the ground,
shuddering incessantly, aghast at your
fate.
17 They will raise this dirge over you:
How you are undone, swept from theEzekiel 26.18–27.2
97
seas, you city of renown! You whose
strength lay in the sea, you and your
inhabitants, who spread your terror
throughout the world.
18 Now the coastlands shudder on the
day of your downfall, and the isles are
appalled at your passing.
19 For the Lord GOD says: When I make
you a desolate city, like cities where no
one lives, when I bring the primeval
ocean up over you and the great waters
cover you,
20 I shall thrust you down with those
who go down to the abyss, to the dead
of all the ages; I shall make you dwell
in the underworld as in places long
desolate, with those that go down to
the abyss. So you will never again be
inhabited or take your place in the land
of the living.
21 I shall bring destruction on you, and
you will be no more; people may look for
you but will never find you again. This is
the word of the Lord GOD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, raise a dirge over Tyre
27Ezekiel 27.3–10
98
3 and say to her who is enthroned at
the gateway to the sea, who carries the
trade of the nations to many coasts and
islands: These are the words of the Lord
GOD: Tyre, you declared, I am perfect in
beauty.
4 Your frontiers were on the high seas,
your builders made your beauty perfect;
5 they used pine from Senir to fashion
all your ribs; they took a cedar from
Lebanon to set up a mast for you.
6 They made your oars of oaks from
Bashan; for your deck they used cypress
from the coasts of Kittim.
7 Your canvas was linen, patterned linen
from Egypt to serve you for sails; your
awnings were violet and purple from the
coasts of Elishah.
8 Men from Sidon and Arvad served
as your oarsmen; you had skilled
men among you, Tyre, acting as your
helmsmen.
9 You had skilled veterans from Gebal to
caulk your seams. Every fully manned
seagoing ship visited your harbour to
traffic in your wares;
10 Persia, Lydia, and Put supplied
mercenaries for your army; they arrayedEzekiel 27.11–17
99
shield and helmet in you, and it was they
who gave you your splendour.
11 Men of Arvad and Cilicia manned
your walls on every side, men of
Gammad were posted on your towers;
they arrayed their bucklers around
your battlements, making your beauty
perfect.
12 Tarshish was a source of your
commerce, from its abundant resources
offering silver, iron, tin, and lead as your
staple wares.
13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech dealt with
you, offering slaves and bronze utensils
as your imports.
14 Men from Togarmah offered horses,
cavalry steeds, and mules as your wares.
15 Rhodians dealt with you; many
islands were a source of your commerce,
paying their dues to you in ivory tusks
and ebony.
16 Edom was a source of your commerce,
so many were your undertakings, and
offered purple garnets, brocade and fine
linen, black coral and red jasper, for your
wares.
17 Judah and Israel traded with you,
offering wheat from Minnith, and meal,Ezekiel 27.18–24
100
grape-syrup, oil, and balm as your
imports.
18 Damascus was a source of your
commerce, so many were your
undertakings, from its abundant
resources offering Helbon wine and
Suhar wool,
19 and casks of wine from Izalla, in
exchange for your wares; wrought iron,
cassia, and sweet cane were among your
imports.
20 Dedan traded with you in coarse
woollens for saddle-cloths.
21 Arabia and all the rulers of Kedar
traded with you; they were the source
of your commerce in lambs, rams, and
goats.
22 Merchants from Sheba and Raamah
traded with you, offering all the choicest
spices, every kind of precious stone, and
gold as your wares.
23 Harran, Kanneh, and Eden, merchants
from Asshur and all Media, traded with
you;
24 they were your dealers in choice
stuffs: violet cloths and brocades, in
stores of coloured fabric rolled up and
tied with cords.Ezekiel 27.25–32
101
25 Ships of Tarshish were the caravans
for your imports; you were deeply laden
with full cargoes on the high seas.
26 Your oarsmen brought you into many
waters, but an east wind wrecked you on
the high seas.
27 Your wealth, your wares, your
imports, your sailors and your
helmsmen, your caulkers, your
merchants, and all your warriors, all who
were in the ship with you were flung into
the sea when it sank.
28 Amid the cries of your helmsmen the
troubled waters tossed.
29 When rowers disembark from their
ships, when sailors and the helmsmen,
all together, go ashore,
30 they mourn aloud over your fate
and cry out bitterly; they throw dust on
their heads and sprinkle themselves with
ashes.
31 At your plight they cut off their hair
and put on sackcloth; they weep bitterly
over you with most bitter wailing.
32 In their lamentation they raise a
dirge and bewail you, saying: Who was
like Tyre, set in the midst of the sea?Ezekiel 27.33–28.4
102
33 When your wares were unloaded off
the seas you met the needs of many
nations; with your vast resources and
your imports you enriched the kings of
the earth.
34 Now you are wrecked at sea, sunk
in deep water; your wares and all your
crew have gone down with you.
35 All who dwell on the coasts and
islands are aghast at your fate; horror is
written on the faces of their kings and
their hair stands on end.
36 Among the nations the merchants
gasp at the sight of you; destruction has
come on you, and you shall be no more.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, say to the ruler of Tyre: This
is what the Lord GOD says: In your
arrogance you say, I am a god; I sit
enthroned like a god on the high seas.
Though you are a man and no god, you
give yourself godlike airs.
3 What, are you wiser than Daniel? Is
no secret beyond your grasp?
4 By your skill and shrewdness you have
amassed wealth, gold and silver in your
treasuries.
28Ezekiel 28.5–13
103
5 By great skill in commerce you have
heaped up riches, and with your riches
your arrogance has grown.
6 The Lord GOD says: Because you give
yourself godlike airs,
7 I am about to bring foreigners against
you, the most ruthless of nations; they
will draw their swords against your fine
wisdom and defile your splendour;
8 they will thrust you down to
destruction, to a violent death on the
high seas.
9 When you face your attackers, will you
still say, I am a god? You are a man and
no god in the hands of those who lay you
low.
10 You will die the death of the
uncircumcised at the hands of
foreigners. I have spoken. This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
11 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
12 O man, raise this dirge over the king
of Tyre, and say to him: This is what
the Lord GOD says: You set the seal on
perfection; you were full of wisdom and
flawless in beauty.
13 In an Eden, a garden of God, you
dwelt, adorned with gems of every kind:Ezekiel 28.14–18
104
sardin and chrysolite and jade, topaz,
cornelian, and green jasper, sapphire,
purple garnet, and green feldspar. Your
jingling beads were of gold, and the
spangles you wore were made for you
on the day of your birth.
14 I appointed a towering cherub as
your guardian; you were on God's holy
mountain and you walked proudly among
stones of fire.
15 You were blameless in your ways
from the day of your birth until iniquity
came to light in you.
16 Your commerce grew so great that
lawlessness filled your heart and led
to wrongdoing. I brought you down in
disgrace from the mountain of God, and
the guardian cherub banished you from
among the stones that flashed like fire.
17 Your beauty made you arrogant; you
debased your wisdom to enhance your
splendour. I flung you to the ground, I
left you exposed to the gaze of kings.
18 So great was the sin in your
dishonest trading that you desecrated
your sanctuaries. I kindled a fire within
you, and it devoured you. I reduced youEzekiel 28.19–25
105
to ashes on the ground for everyone to
see.
19 Among the nations all who knew you
were aghast: destruction has come on
you, and you will be no more.
20 This word of the LORD came to me:
21 O man, face towards Sidon and
prophesy against her.
22 The Lord GOD says: Sidon, I am
against you and I shall show my glory in
your midst. People will know that I am
the LORD when I execute judgement on
her and show my holiness in her.
23 I shall let loose pestilence on her
and bloodshed in her streets; beset on
all sides by the sword the slain will fall
within her walls. Then people will know
that I am the LORD.
24 No longer will the Israelites suffer
from the scorn of their neighbours,
the pricking of briars and scratching of
thorns, and they will know that I am the
Lord GOD.
25 The Lord GOD says: When I gather
the Israelites from the peoples among
whom they are dispersed, I shall show
my holiness in them for all the nationsEzekiel 28.26–29.5
106
to see. They will live on their own soil,
which I gave to my servant Jacob.
26 They will live there undisturbed, build
houses, and plant vineyards. When I
execute judgement on all their scornful
neighbours, they will live undisturbed.
Thus they will know that I am the LORD
their God.
1 THIS word of the LORD came
to me on the twelfth day of the
tenth month in the tenth year:
2 O man, face towards Pharaoh king of
Egypt and prophesy against him and the
whole of Egypt.
3 Say to them: The Lord GOD says: I am
against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you
great monster, lurking in the streams of
the Nile. You have said, My Nile is my
own; it was I who made it.
4 But I shall put hooks in your jaws and
they will cling to your scales. I shall haul
you up out of its streams with all its fish
clinging to your scales.
5 I shall fling you into the desert, you
and all the fish in your streams; you will
fall on the ground with none to give you
burial; I shall give you as food to beasts
and birds.
29Ezekiel 29.6–12
107
6 Then all who live in Egypt will know
that I am the LORD. The support you
gave the Israelites was no better than a
reed.
7 When they grasped you, you splintered
in their hands and tore their armpits;
when they leaned on you, you broke and
their limbs gave way.
8 The Lord GOD says: I am bringing a
sword on you to destroy both people and
animals.
9 Egypt will become a desolate waste
land, and they will know that I am the
LORD. Because you said, The Nile is
mine; it was I who made it,
10 I am against you and your Nile. I
shall make Egypt desolate, wasted by
drought, from Migdol to Syene and as
far as the frontier of Cush.
11 Untrodden by people or animals, it
will lie uninhabited for forty years.
12 I shall make Egypt the most desolate
of desolate lands, her cities the most
derelict of derelict cities. For forty years
they will lie derelict, and I shall scatter
the Egyptians among the nations,
dispersing them throughout the earth.Ezekiel 29.13–19
108
13 The Lord GOD says: At the end of
forty years I shall gather the Egyptians
from the peoples among whom they are
scattered.
14 I shall restore the fortunes of Egypt
and bring her people back to Pathros,
the land of their origin, where they will
be a petty kingdom.
15 It will become the most paltry
of kingdoms and never again lord it
over the nations, for I shall make the
Egyptians too few to rule over them.
16 The Israelites, always mindful of their
sin in turning to Egypt for help, will never
trust Egypt again. They will know that I
am the Lord GOD.
17 This word of the LORD came to me
on the first day of the first month in the
twenty-seventh year:
18 O man, King Nebuchadrezzar of
Babylon kept his army in the field against
Tyre so long that everyone's head was
rubbed bare and everyone's shoulder
chafed. But no gain from Tyre accrued to
him or to his army from their campaign.
19 This, therefore, is the word of the
Lord GOD: I am now giving Egypt to
King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. He willEzekiel 29.20–30.6
109
carry off its wealth, he will despoil and
plunder it, and so his army will receive
their wages.
20 I have given him Egypt in payment
for his service because they have
spurned my authority. This is the word
of the Lord GOD.
21 At that time I shall make Israel renew
her strength, and give you back the
power to speak among them, and they
will know that I am the LORD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, prophesy and say: The Lord
GOD says: Wail! Alas for the day!
3 A day is near, a day of the LORD is
near, a day of cloud, a day of reckoning
for the nations!
4 A sword will come on Egypt, and there
will be anguish in Cush, when the slain
fall in Egypt, when her wealth is seized,
her foundations are demolished.
5 Cush and Put and Lydia, all the Arabs,
Libyans, and peoples of allied lands will
fall by the sword along with Egypt.
6 The LORD says: Those who support
Egypt will fall and her boasted might will
be brought low; from Migdol to Syene
30Ezekiel 30.7–12
110
they will fall by the sword. This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
7 They will be the most desolate of
desolate lands, their cities the most
derelict of derelict cities.
8 When I set Egypt on fire and all her
helpers are shattered, they will know
that I am the LORD.
9 When that day comes messengers
will go out in ships from my presence to
strike terror into Cush, still undisturbed,
and anguish shall come on her in Egypt's
hour. Now it is near.
10 The Lord GOD says: I shall make an
end of Egypt's hordes at the hand of
King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.
11 He and his people with him, the most
ruthless of nations, will be brought to
ravage the land. They will draw their
swords against Egypt and fill the land
with the slain.
12 I shall turn the streams of the Nile
into dry land and sell Egypt into the
power of evil men. By the hands of
foreigners I shall lay waste the land
and everything in it. I, the LORD, have
spoken.Ezekiel 30.13–20
111
13 The Lord GOD says: I shall make an
end of the petty rulers and wipe out the
chieftains of Noph; never again will a
prince arise in Egypt. I shall instil terror
into that land:
14 I shall lay Pathros waste and set fire
to Zoan and execute judgement on No.
15 I shall vent my wrath on Sin, the
bastion of Egypt, and destroy the hordes
of Noph.
16 I shall set Egypt on fire, and Syene
will writhe in anguish; the walls of No
will be breached and floodwaters will
burst into it.
17 The young men of On and Pi-beseth
will fall by the sword and the cities
themselves will go into captivity.
18 Daylight will fail in Tahpanhes when
I break the power of Egypt there; there
her boasted might will be brought to
an end. A cloud will cover her, and her
daughters will go into captivity.
19 I shall execute judgement on Egypt,
and they will know that I am the LORD.
20 This word of the LORD came to me
on the seventh day of the first month in
the eleventh year:Ezekiel 30.21–26
112
21 O man, I have broken the arm
of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and it has
not been bound up with dressings or
bandaged to make it strong enough to
wield a sword.
22 The Lord GOD says: I am against
Pharaoh king of Egypt; I shall break both
his arms, the sound and the broken, and
make the sword fall from his hand.
23 I shall scatter the Egyptians
among the nations and disperse them
throughout the earth.
24 I shall strengthen the arms of the
king of Babylon and put my sword in his
hand; I shall break Pharaoh's arms, and
he will lie wounded and groaning before
him.
25 I shall give strength to the arms of
the king of Babylon, but Pharaoh's arms
will fall. All will know that I am the LORD,
when I put my sword into the hand of
the king of Babylon, and he stretches it
out over the land of Egypt.
26 I shall scatter the Egyptians
among the nations and disperse them
throughout the earth, and they will know
that I am the LORD.Ezekiel 31.1– 7
113
1 On the first day of the third
31 month in the eleventh year this
word of the LORD came to me:
2 O man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt
and to his hordes: In your greatness,
what are you like?
3 Look at Assyria: it was a cedar in
Lebanon, towering high with its crown
pushing through the foliage and its fair
branches overshadowing the forest.
4 Springs nourished it, the underground
waters made it lofty, their streams
washed the soil all round it and sent
channels of water to every tree in the
country.
5 So it grew taller than every other
tree. Its boughs were many, its branches
far-spreading; for water was abundant
in the channels.
6 In its boughs all the birds of the air
had their nests, under its branches all
wild creatures bore their young, and in
its shade all great nations made their
home.
7 A splendid, great tree it was, with its
far-spreading boughs, for its roots were
beside abundant waters.Ezekiel 31.8–14
114
8 No cedar in God's garden eclipsed
it, no juniper could compare with its
boughs, and no plane tree had such
branches; not a tree in God's garden
could rival its beauty.
9 I, the LORD, made it beautiful with its
mass of spreading boughs, the envy of
every tree in Eden, the garden of God.
10 The Lord GOD says: Because it grew
so high, raising its crown through the
foliage, and its pride mounted as it grew,
11 I handed it over to a prince of the
nations to deal with it; I made an
example of it as its wickedness deserved.
12 Foreigners, the most ruthless of
nations, cut it down and left it lying. Its
sweeping boughs fell on the mountains
and in all the valleys, and its branches
lay broken beside every water-channel
on earth. All the peoples of the earth
came out from under its shade and left
it.
13 On its fallen trunk the birds all
settled, the wild creatures all sought
shelter among its branches.
14 Never again will the well-watered
trees grow so high or push their crowns
up through the foliage. Nor will theEzekiel 31.15–18
115
strongest of them, though well-watered,
attain their full height; for all have been
given over to death, to the world below,
to share the fate of mortals and go down
to the abyss.
15 The Lord GOD says: When he went
down to Sheol, I dried up the deep, I
dammed its rivers, the great waters
were held back. I brought mourning on
Lebanon for him, and all the trees of the
countryside wilted.
16 I made nations shake at the sound of
his downfall, when I brought him down
to Sheol with those who go down to the
abyss. From this all the trees of Eden,
the choicest and best of Lebanon, all the
well-watered trees, drew comfort in the
world below.
17 They too like him had gone down to
Sheol, to those slain by the sword, and
those among the nations who had lived
in his shade.
18 Which among the trees of Eden was
like you in glory and greatness? Yet you
will be brought down with the trees of
Eden to the world below; you will lie with
those who have been slain by the sword,
in the company of the uncircumcisedEzekiel 32.1– 6
116
dead. So it will be with Pharaoh and all
his hordes. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
1 On the first day of the twelfth
month in the twelfth year this
word of the LORD came to me:
2 O man, raise a dirge over Pharaoh
king of Egypt and say to him: Young lion
of the nations, your end has come. You
were like a monster in the waters of the
Nile scattering the water with its snout,
churning up the water with its feet and
muddying the streams.
3 The Lord GOD says: When many
nations are assembled I shall spread my
net over you, and you will be hauled
ashore in its meshes.
4 I shall fling you on land, dashing you
on the ground. I shall let all the birds of
the air settle upon you and all the wild
beasts gorge themselves on you.
5 I shall leave your carcass on the
mountains, and fill the valleys with the
worms that feed on it.
6 I shall drench the land with your blood
as it pours out on the mountains, and
the ravines will be filled with it.
32Ezekiel 32.7–13
117
7 When your light is quenched I shall
veil the sky and darken its stars; I shall
veil the sun with clouds, and the moon
will give no light.
8 I shall darken all the shining lights of
the sky above you and bring darkness
over your land. This is the word of the
Lord GOD.
9 I shall cause disquiet to many peoples
when I bring your broken army among
the nations, into lands you have never
known.
10 I shall appal many peoples with
your fate; when I brandish my sword in
the presence of their kings, their hair
will stand on end. On the day of your
downfall not a moment will pass without
each trembling for his own fate.
11 For the Lord GOD has said: The king
of Babylon's sword will come upon you.
12 I shall make your hordes of people
fall by the sword of warriors who are
of all men the most ruthless. They will
shatter the pride of Egypt, and all her
hordes will be wiped out.
13 I shall destroy all their cattle beside
abundant waters. No foot or hoof will
ever churn them up again.Ezekiel 32.14–21
118
14 Then I shall let their waters settle
and their streams glide smooth as oil.
This is the word of the Lord GOD.
15 When I have laid Egypt waste, and
the whole land lies empty, when I strike
down all who live there, they will know
that I am the LORD.
16 The women of the nations will raise
this dirge, singing it as a dirge over
Egypt and all her hordes. This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
17 On the fifteenth day of the first
month in the twelfth year, this word of
the LORD came to me:
18 O man, raise a lament, you and the
daughters of the nations, over Egypt's
hordes and her nobility. I shall consign
them to the world below, in company
with those who go down to the abyss.
19 Are you better favoured than others?
Go down and lie with the uncircumcised
dead.
20 A sword is drawn. Those who
marched with her, together with all her
hordes, will descend into the company of
those slain by the sword.
21 Warrior chieftains in Sheol speak to
Pharaoh and his allies. The uncircumcisedEzekiel 32.22–26
119
dead, slain by the sword, have come
down and lie there.
22 Assyria is there with all her company
buried around her, all of them slain,
victims of the sword.
23 Their graves are set in the farthest
depths of the abyss, with her slain buried
round about her, all victims of the sword,
who once spread terror in the land of the
living.
24 Elam is there with all her people
buried around her, all of them slain,
victims of the sword. They have gone
down uncircumcised to the world below,
who spread terror in the land of the
living, but now bear disgrace with those
who go down to the abyss.
25 A bed has been made for her in
the midst of the slain. All her peoples
are buried around her, all of them
uncircumcised, victims of the sword.
Those, who once spread terror in the
land of the living, now bear disgrace with
those who go down to the abyss, and
are assigned a place in the midst of the
slain.
26 Meshech and Tubal are there with all
their hordes buried around them, all ofEzekiel 32.27–31
120
them uncircumcised, slain by the sword,
who once spread terror in the land of the
living.
27 Do they not rest with warriors fallen
uncircumcised, who have gone down to
Sheol with their weapons, their swords
laid under their heads and their shields
over their bones, though the terror of
the warriors once weighed heavily on the
land of the living?
28 Pharaoh, you also will lie broken in
the company of the uncircumcised dead,
lying with those slain by the sword.
29 Edom is there, with her kings and
all her princes, who, despite their
might, have been laid with those slain
by the sword. They will lie with the
uncircumcised dead and with those who
go down to the abyss.
30 All the princes of the north and the
Sidonians are there, who, despite the
terror inspired by their might, have gone
down in shame with the slain. They lie
uncircumcised with those slain by the
sword, and they bear disgrace with those
who go down to the abyss.
31 Pharaoh will see them and be
consoled for his lost hordes -- PharaohEzekiel 32.32–33.6
121
who, with all his army, is slain by the
sword, says the Lord GOD.
32 Though he spread terror throughout
the land of the living, yet he with
all his hordes is laid with those slain
by the sword, in the company of the
uncircumcised dead. This is the word of
the Lord GOD.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
2 O man, say to your fellow-countrymen:
When I bring a sword against a land, its
people choose one of themselves to be
their watchman,
3 and if he sees the enemy approach,
he blows his trumpet to warn the people.
4 If anyone does not heed the warning
and is overtaken by the sword, his fate
be on his own head!
5 He ignored the alarm when he heard
it. Had he taken heed, he would have
escaped with his life.
6 But if the watchman does not blow
his trumpet to give warning when he
sees the approach of the enemy, and if
anyone who is killed is caught with his
sins on him, I shall hold the watchman
answerable for his death.
33Ezekiel 33.7–12
122
7 I have appointed you, O man, a
watchman for the Israelites, and you
must pass to them any warnings you
receive from me.
8 If I pronounce sentence of death on a
person because he is wicked and you do
not speak out to dissuade him from his
ways, that person will die because of his
sin, but I shall hold you answerable for
his death.
9 However, if you have warned him to
give up his ways, and he persists in
them, he will die because of his sin, but
you will have saved yourself.
10 O man, say to the Israelites: You
complain, We are burdened by our
sins and offences; we are pining away
because of them, and despair of life.
11 Tell them: As I live, says the Lord
GOD, I have no desire for the death
of the wicked. I would rather that the
wicked should mend their ways and live.
Give them up, give up your evil ways.
Israelites, why should you die?
12 O man, say to your fellow-
countrymen: When a righteous person
transgresses, his righteousness will not
save him. When a wicked person mendsEzekiel 33.13–18
123
his ways, his former wickedness will
not bring him down. When a righteous
person sins, all his righteousness cannot
save his life.
13 When I tell the righteous person that
he will save his life, then if he presumes
on his righteousness and does wrong,
none of his righteous deeds will be
remembered: but for the wrong he has
done he will die.
14 When I pronounce sentence of death
on the wicked, then if he mends his ways
and does what is just and right --
15 if he restores the pledges he has
taken, makes good what he has stolen,
and, doing no more wrong, follows the
rules that ensure life -- he will live and
not die.
16 None of the sins he has committed
will be remembered against him;
because he does what is just and right,
he will live.
17 Yet your fellow-countrymen say, The
Lord acts without principle, but in fact it
is their ways which are unprincipled.
18 If a righteous man gives up his
righteousness and does wrong, he will
die because of it;Ezekiel 33.19–25
124
19 if a wicked man gives up his
wickedness and does what is just and
right, he will live.
20 Israel, how can you say that the Lord
acts without principle, when I judge each
one of you according to his deeds?
21 In the twelfth year of our captivity,
on the fifth day of the tenth month,
a fugitive came from Jerusalem and
reported that the city had fallen.
22 The evening before he arrived, the
hand of the LORD had come upon me,
but by the time the fugitive reached me
in the morning the LORD had given me
back the power of speech. My speech
was restored and I was no longer dumb.
23 The word of the LORD came to me:
24 O man, the inhabitants of these ruins
on Israel's soil say, When Abraham took
possession of the land he was but one
man; we are many, and surely the land
has been granted to us.
25 Tell them, therefore, that the Lord
GOD says: You eat meat with the blood
still in it, you worship idols, you shed
blood; and yet you expect to possess the
land!Ezekiel 33.26–31
125
26 You resort to the sword, you commit
abominations, you defile one another's
wives, and yet you expect to keep
possession of the land!
27 Tell them that the Lord GOD says: As
I live, those among the ruins will fall by
the sword; those in the open country I
shall give to wild beasts for food; those
in dens and caves will die by pestilence.
28 I shall make the land a desolate
waste; her boasted might will be brought
to an end, and the mountains of Israel
will be an untrodden desert.
29 When I make the land a desolate
waste because of all the abominations
they have committed, then they will
know that I am the LORD.
30 O man, your fellow-countrymen
gather in groups and talk of you by the
walls and in doorways, saying to one
another, Let us go and see what message
there is from the LORD.
31 So my people will come in to you, as
people are wont to do. They will sit down
in front of you, and hear what you have
to say, but they will not act on it. Fine
words! they will say with insincerity, for
their hearts are set on selfish gain.Ezekiel 33.32–34.5
126
32 To them you are no more than a
singer of fine songs with a lovely voice
and skill as a harpist. They will listen to
what you say, but none of them will act
on it.
33 When it comes, as come it will, they
will know that there has been a prophet
in their midst.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
2 Prophesy, O man, against the rulers of
Israel. Prophesy and say to them: You
shepherds, these are the words of the
Lord GOD: Woe betide Israel's shepherds
who care only for themselves! Should
not the shepherd care for the flock?
3 You consume the milk, wear the wool,
and slaughter the fat beasts, but you do
not feed the sheep.
4 You have not restored the weak,
tended the sick, bandaged the injured,
recovered the straggler, or searched
for the lost; you have driven them with
ruthless severity.
5 They are scattered abroad for want of
a shepherd, and have become the prey
of every wild beast. Scattered,
34Ezekiel 34.6–11
127
6 my sheep go straying over all the
mountains and on every high hill; my
flock is dispersed over the whole earth,
with no one to enquire after them or
search for them.
7 Therefore, you shepherds, hear the
word of the LORD.
8 As surely as I live, says the Lord
GOD, because for lack of a shepherd my
sheep are ravaged by all the wild beasts
and have become their prey, because
my shepherds have not taken thought
for the sheep, but have cared only for
themselves and not for the sheep --
9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the
word of the LORD.
10 The Lord GOD says: I am against
the shepherds and shall demand from
them an account of my sheep. I shall
dismiss those shepherds from tending
my flock: no longer will they care only
for themselves; I shall rescue my sheep
from their mouths, and they will feed on
them no more.
11 For the Lord GOD says: Now I myself
shall take thought for my sheep and
search for them.Ezekiel 34.12–17
128
12 As a shepherd goes in search of his
sheep when his flock is scattered from
him in every direction, so I shall go in
search of my sheep and rescue them, no
matter where they were scattered in a
day of cloud and darkness.
13 I shall lead them out from the
nations, gather them in from different
lands, and bring them home to their own
country. I shall shepherd them on the
mountains of Israel and by her streams,
wherever there is a settlement.
14 I shall feed them on good grazing-
ground, and their pasture will be Israel's
high mountains. There they will rest in
good pasture, and find rich grazing on
the mountains of Israel.
15 I myself shall tend my flock, and find
them a place to rest, says the Lord GOD.
16 I shall search for the lost, recover
the straggler, bandage the injured,
strengthen the sick, leave the healthy
and strong to play, and give my flock
their proper food.
17 The Lord GOD says to you, my flock:
I shall judge between one sheep and
another. As for you rams and he-goats,Ezekiel 34.18–25
129
18 are you not satisfied with grazing on
the best pastures, that you must also
trample down the rest with your feet? Or
with drinking clear water, that you must
also muddy the rest with your feet?
19 My flock has to graze on what you
have trampled underfoot and drink what
you have muddied.
20 Therefore, the Lord GOD says to
them: Now I myself shall judge between
the fat sheep and the lean.
21 You push aside the weak with flank
and shoulder, you butt them with your
horns until you have scattered them in
every direction.
22 Therefore I shall save my flock, and
they will be ravaged no more; I shall
judge between one sheep and another.
23 I shall set over them one shepherd to
take care of them, my servant David; he
will care for them and be their shepherd.
24 I, the LORD, shall be their God, and
my servant David will be prince among
them. I, the LORD, have spoken.
25 I shall make a covenant with them to
ensure peace and prosperity; I shall rid
the land of wild beasts, and people willEzekiel 34.26–35.1
130
live on the open pastures and sleep in
the woods free from danger.
26 I shall settle them in the
neighbourhood of my hill and bless them
with rain in due season.
27 Trees in the countryside will bear their
fruit, the ground will yield its produce,
and my people will live in security on
their own soil. When I break the bars of
their yokes and rescue them from the
power of those who have enslaved them
they will know that I am the LORD.
28 They will never again be ravaged by
the nations, nor will wild beasts devour
them; they will live in security, free from
terror.
29 I shall make their crops renowned,
and they will never again be victims of
famine in the land, nor bear any longer
the taunts of the nations.
30 Then they will know that I, the LORD
their God, am with them, and that they
are my people Israel, says the Lord GOD.
31 You are my flock, the flock I feed,
and I am your God. It is the word of the
Lord GOD.
1 This word of the LORD came to
me:
35Ezekiel 35.2– 9
131
2 O man, face towards the hill-country
of Seir and prophesy against it.
3 Say: These are the words of the Lord
GOD: Hill-country of Seir, I am against
you: I shall stretch out my hand to strike
you and reduce you to a desolate waste.
4 I shall lay your towns in ruins and you
will become a desolation. Then you will
know that I am the LORD;
5 for you have kept up an ancient feud
and handed over the Israelites to the
sword in the hour of their doom, the
hour of their final punishment.
6 Therefore, as I live, says the Lord
GOD, I shall make blood your destiny,
and it will pursue you; you are most
surely guilty of blood, and it will pursue
you.
7 I shall make the hill-country of Seir
a desolate waste and prevent anyone
travelling to and fro in it;
8 I shall cover your hills and valleys with
the slain, and those slain by the sword
will fall into your streams.
9 I shall make you desolate for ever, and
your cities will not be inhabited. Then
you will know that I am the LORD.Ezekiel 35.10–36.1
132
10 You say, The two nations and the two
countries will be mine and I shall take
possession of them, though the LORD
has been there.
11 Therefore, as I live, says the Lord
GOD, your anger and jealousy will be
repaid, for I shall do to you what you
have done in your hatred towards them.
I shall be known among you by the way
I judge you;
12 you will know that I am the LORD.
I have heard all your blasphemous talk
about the mountains of Israel. You have
said, They are desolate and have been
given to us to devour.
13 You have boasted against me and
spoken wildly. I myself have heard you.
14 The Lord GOD says: I shall make you
so desolate that the whole world will
gloat over you.
15 I shall treat you as you treated Israel
my own possession when you gloated
over its desolation. Hill-country of Seir,
the whole of Edom, you will be desolate.
Then all will know that I am the LORD.
1 O man, prophesy to the
mountains of Israel and say:
36Ezekiel 36.2– 6
133
Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the
LORD.
2 The Lord GOD says: The enemy has
boasted over you, Aha! Now the ancient
heights are ours.
3 Therefore prophesy and say: These
are the words of the Lord GOD: You
mountains of Israel, all round you men
gloated over you and trampled you down
when you were seized and occupied
by the rest of the nations; your name
was bandied about in common gossip.
Therefore, listen to the words of the Lord
GOD when he speaks to the mountains
and hills, to the streams and valleys,
to ruined places and deserted cities, all
plundered and despised by the rest of
the surrounding nations.
4 (36:3)
5 The Lord GOD says: In the heat of my
jealousy I have spoken out against the
rest of the nations, and against Edom
above all, for with hearts full of glee and
feelings of contempt they seized my land
as spoil.
6 Therefore prophesy over the soil of
Israel; say to the mountains and hills,
the streams and valleys: The Lord GODEzekiel 36.7–12
134
has said: I have spoken my mind in
jealous anger because you have had to
endure the taunts of the nations.
7 Therefore, says the Lord GOD, I swear
with uplifted hand that the nations round
about you will in turn endure taunting.
8 But you, mountains of Israel, will
put forth your branches and yield your
fruit for my people Israel, for their
homecoming is near.
9 See now, I am for you, I shall turn to
you, and you will be tilled and sown.
10 I shall settle on you many people --
the whole house of Israel. The towns will
again be inhabited and the ruined places
rebuilt.
11 I shall settle in you many people and
beasts; they will increase and be fruitful.
I shall make you populous as in days
of old, and more prosperous than you
were in your earliest times. Thus you will
know that I am the LORD.
12 I shall make my people Israel tread
your paths again. They will settle in you,
and you will be their possession. Never
again will you leave them childless.Ezekiel 36.13–20
135
13 The Lord GOD says: It is said that
you are a land that devours human
beings and leaves your nation childless.
14 But never again will you devour them
or leave your nation childless, says the
Lord GOD.
15 I shall never let you hear again the
taunts of the surrounding nations, nor
will you have to suffer the scorn of
foreigners. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
16 This word of the LORD came to me:
17 O man, when the Israelites were
living on their own soil they defiled it
with their ways and deeds; their ways
were loathsome and unclean in my sight.
18 I poured out my fury on them for the
blood they had poured out on the land,
and for the idols with which they had
defiled it.
19 I scattered them among the nations,
and they were dispersed in many lands.
I passed a sentence on them which their
ways and deeds deserved.
20 But whenever they came among the
nations, they caused my holy name to
be profaned. It was said of them, TheseEzekiel 36.21–26
136
are the LORD's people, and it is from his
land they have gone into exile.
21 So I spared them for the sake of
my holy name which the Israelites had
profaned among the nations to whom
they had gone.
22 Therefore tell the Israelites that the
Lord GOD says: It is not for the sake of
you Israelites that I am acting, but for
the sake of my holy name, which you
have profaned among the peoples where
you have gone.
23 I shall hallow my great name, which
you have profaned among those nations.
When they see that I reveal my holiness
through you, they will know that I am
the LORD, says the Lord GOD.
24 I shall take you from among the
nations, and gather you from every land,
and bring you to your homeland.
25 I shall sprinkle pure water over you,
and you will be purified from everything
that defiles you; I shall purify you from
the taint of all your idols.
26 I shall give you a new heart and put
a new spirit within you; I shall remove
the heart of stone from your body and
give you a heart of flesh.Ezekiel 36.27–33
137
27 I shall put my spirit within you and
make you conform to my statutes; you
will observe my laws faithfully.
28 Then you will live in the land I gave to
your forefathers; you will be my people,
and I shall be your God.
29 Having saved you from all that defiles
you, I shall command the grain to be
plentiful; I shall bring no more famine
upon you.
30 I shall make the trees bear abundant
fruit and the ground yield heavy crops,
so that you will never again have to
bear among the nations the reproach of
famine.
31 You will recall your wicked conduct
and evil deeds, and you will loathe
yourselves because of your wrongdoing
and your abominations.
32 I assure you it is not for your sake
that I am acting, says the Lord GOD,
so feel the shame and disgrace of your
ways, people of Israel.
33 The Lord GOD says: When I have
cleansed you of all your wrongdoing, I
shall resettle the towns, and the ruined
places will be rebuilt.Ezekiel 36.34–37.1
138
34 The land now desolate will be
tilled, instead of lying waste for every
passer-by to see.
35 Everyone will say that this land which
was waste has become like a garden
of Eden, and the towns once ruined,
wasted, and shattered will now be
fortified and inhabited.
36 The nations still left around you
will know that it is I, the LORD, who
have rebuilt the shattered towns and
replanted the land laid waste; I, the
LORD, have spoken and I shall do it.
37 The Lord GOD says: Once again
I shall let the Israelites pray to me
for help. I shall make their people as
numerous as a flock of sheep.
38 As Jerusalem is filled with sheep
offered as holy-gifts at times of festival,
so will their ruined cities be filled with
flocks of people. Then they will know
that I am the LORD.
1 The LORD's hand was upon me,
and he carried me out by his spirit
and set me down in a plain that was full
of bones.
37Ezekiel 37.2– 9
139
2 He made me pass among them in
every direction. Countless in number
and very dry, they covered the plain.
3 He said to me, O man, can these
bones live? I answered, Only you, Lord
GOD, know that.
4 He said, Prophesy over these bones;
say: Dry bones, hear the word of the
LORD.
5 The Lord GOD says to these bones:
I am going to put breath into you, and
you will live.
6 I shall fasten sinews on you, clothe
you with flesh, cover you with skin, and
give you breath, and you will live. Then
you will know that I am the LORD.
7 I began to prophesy as I had been
told, and as I prophesied there was a
rattling sound and the bones all fitted
themselves together.
8 As I watched, sinews appeared upon
them, flesh clothed them, and they were
covered with skin, but there was no
breath in them.
9 Then he said to me, Prophesy to the
wind, prophesy, O man, and say to it:
These are the words of the Lord GOD:
Let winds come from every quarter andEzekiel 37.10–16
140
breathe into these slain, that they may
come to life.
10 I prophesied as I had been told;
breath entered them, and they came
to life and rose to their feet, a mighty
company.
11 He said to me, O man, these bones
are the whole people of Israel. They say,
Our bones are dry, our hope is gone, and
we are cut off.
12 Prophesy, therefore, and say to them:
The Lord GOD has said: My people, I
shall open your graves and bring you up
from them, and restore you to the land
of Israel.
13 You, my people, will know that I am
the LORD when I open your graves and
bring you up from them.
14 Then I shall put my spirit into you
and you will come to life, and I shall
settle you on your own soil, and you will
know that I the LORD have spoken and I
shall act. This is the word of the LORD.
15 THIS word of the LORD came to me:
16 O man, take one leaf of a wooden
tablet and write on it, Judah and the
Israelites associated with him. Then take
another leaf and write on it, Joseph,Ezekiel 37.17–23
141
the leaf of Ephraim and all the Israelite
tribes.
17 Now bring the two together to form
one tablet; then they will be a folding
tablet in your hand.
18 When your fellow-countrymen ask
you to tell them what you mean by this,
19 say to them: The Lord GOD has
said: I am taking the leaf of Joseph,
which belongs to Ephraim and the other
tribes of Israel, and joining to it the leaf
of Judah. Thus I shall make them one
tablet, and they will be one in my hand.
20 When the leaves on which you write
are there in your hand for all to see,
21 say to them: The Lord GOD has said:
I am going to take the Israelites from
their places of exile among the nations; I
shall assemble them from every quarter
and restore them to their own soil.
22 I shall make them a single nation in
the land, on the mountains of Israel,
and one king will be over them all. No
longer will they be two nations, no longer
divided into two kingdoms.
23 They will never again be defiled with
their idols, their loathsome ways, and
all their acts of disloyalty. I shall saveEzekiel 37.24–38.1
142
them from all their sinful backsliding
and purify them. Thus they will be my
people, and I shall be their God.
24 My servant David will be king over
them; they will all have one shepherd.
They will conform to my laws and my
statutes and observe them faithfully.
25 They will live in the land which I gave
to my servant Jacob, the land where
your forefathers lived. They and their
descendants will live there for ever, and
my servant David is to be their prince for
ever.
26 I shall make an everlasting covenant
with them to ensure peace and
prosperity. I shall greatly increase their
numbers, and I shall put my sanctuary
in their midst for all time.
27 They will live under the shelter of my
dwelling; I shall be their God and they
will be my people.
28 The nations will know that I the LORD
am keeping Israel sacred to myself,
because my sanctuary is in their midst
for ever.
1 THIS word of the LORD came to
me:
38Ezekiel 38.2– 8
143
2 O man, face towards Gog in the land
of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech,
and Tubal, and prophesy against him.
3 Say: These are the words of the Lord
GOD: I am against you, Gog, prince of
Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
4 I shall put hooks in your jaws and turn
you round. I shall lead you out, you and
your whole army, horses and horsemen,
all fully equipped, a great host with
bucklers and shields, every man wielding
a sword.
5 With them will march the men of
Persia, Cush, and Put, all with shields
and helmets,
6 Gomer and all its squadrons, Beth-
togarmah with all its squadrons from
the far recesses of the north -- a great
concourse of peoples with you.
7 Be prepared; make ready, you and all
the host which has rallied to you, and
hold yourselves at my disposal.
8 After a long time has passed you will
be summoned; in years to come you will
invade a land restored from ruin, whose
people are gathered from many nations
on the mountains of Israel that have
been so long desolate. The Israelites,Ezekiel 38.9–13
144
brought out from the nations, will all be
living undisturbed;
9 and you will come up, advancing like
a hurricane; you will be like a cloud
covering the land, you and all your
squadrons, a great concourse of peoples.
10 The Lord GOD says: At that time a
thought will enter your head and you will
hatch an evil plan.
11 You will say, I shall attack a land of
open villages and fall upon a people
living quiet and undisturbed, undefended
by walls or barred gates.
12 You will expect to come plundering,
spoiling, and stripping bare the
settlements which once lay in ruins, but
are now inhabited by a people gathered
out of the nations, a people acquiring
livestock and goods, and making their
home at the very centre of the world.
13 Sheba and Dedan, the traders of
Tarshish and her leading merchants, will
say to you, Is it for plunder that you
have come? Have you mustered your
host to get spoil, to carry off silver and
gold, to take livestock and goods, to
seize much booty?Ezekiel 38.14–20
145
14 Therefore, O man, prophesy and say
to Gog: The Lord GOD says: On that
day when my people Israel are living
undisturbed, will you not bestir yourself
15 and come with many nations from
your home in the far recesses of the
north, all riding on horses, a large host,
a mighty army?
16 You will advance against my people
Israel like a cloud that covers the earth.
In the last days I shall bring you against
my land, that the nations may know me,
when they see me prove my holiness at
Gog's expense.
17 The Lord GOD says: When I spoke
in days of old through my servants
the prophets, who prophesied in those
days unceasingly, it was you whom I
threatened to bring against Israel.
18 On that day, when at length Gog
invades Israel, says the Lord GOD, my
wrath will boil over.
19 In my jealousy and in the heat of my
anger I swear that there will be a great
earthquake throughout the land of Israel
on that day,
20 and the fish in the sea and the
birds in the air, the wild animals and allEzekiel 38.21–39.2
146
creatures that move on the ground, and
every human being on the face of the
earth will quake before me. Mountains
will be overthrown, the terraced hills
collapse, and every wall crash to the
ground.
21 I shall summon universal terror
against Gog, says the Lord GOD, and his
men will turn their swords against one
another.
22 I shall bring him to judgement with
pestilence and bloodshed; I shall pour
torrential rain and hailstones as well
as fire and brimstone on him and his
squadrons and the whole concourse of
peoples with him.
23 I shall show myself great and holy
and make myself known to many
nations. Then they will know that I am
the LORD.
1 O man, prophesy against Gog
and say: The Lord GOD says: I
am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh,
Meshech, and Tubal.
2 I shall turn you round and drive
you on. I shall lead you from the far
recesses of the north and bring you to
the mountains of Israel.
39Ezekiel 39.3– 9
147
3 I shall strike the bow from your left
hand and dash the arrows from your
right hand.
4 On the mountains of Israel you will
fall, you and all your squadrons and
allies. I shall give you as food to every
kind of bird of prey and to the wild
beasts.
5 You will fall on the ground, for it is I
who have spoken. This is the word of the
Lord GOD.
6 I shall send fire on Magog and on
those who live undisturbed in the coasts
and islands. Then they will know that I
am the LORD.
7 My holy name I shall make known in
the midst of my people Israel and no
longer let it be profaned; the nations will
know that I, the LORD, am holy in Israel.
8 See, it is coming; it is here! says the
Lord GOD; it is the day of which I have
spoken.
9 Those who live in Israel's towns will
go out and gather weapons for fuel,
bucklers and shields, bows and arrows,
throwing-sticks and lances; for seven
years they will kindle fires with them.Ezekiel 39.10–15
148
10 They will take no wood from the
fields, nor cut it from the forests, but will
use the weapons to light their fires. Thus
they will plunder those who plundered
them and spoil their despoilers. This is
the word of the Lord GOD.
11 On that day, instead of a burial-
ground in Israel, I shall assign to Gog
the valley of Abarim east of the Dead
Sea. There Gog with all his horde will
be buried, and Abarim will be entirely
blocked. It will be called the Valley of
Gog's Horde.
12 It will take the Israelites seven
months to bury them and to purify the
land,
13 and all the people will share in the
task. The day that I win myself honour
will be a memorable day for them. This
is the word of the Lord GOD.
14 Men will be picked for the regular
duty of going through the country to
bury any left above ground, and so purify
the land. They will begin their search at
the end of the seven months:
15 they will go up and down the country,
and whenever one of them sees a human
bone he is to put a marker beside it,Ezekiel 39.16–22
149
until it has been buried in the Valley of
Gog's Horde.
16 So no more will be heard of that great
horde, and the land will be purified.
17 O man, the Lord GOD says: Cry to
every bird that flies and to all the wild
beasts: Assemble and come, gather from
every side to my sacrifice, the great
sacrifice I am preparing for you on the
mountains of Israel. Eat flesh and drink
blood,
18 eat the flesh of warriors and drink
the blood of the rulers of the earth; all
these are your rams, sheep, he-goats,
and bulls, and buffaloes of Bashan.
19 You will sate yourselves with fat and
drink yourselves drunk on blood at the
sacrifice which I am preparing for you.
20 At my table you will eat your fill
of horses and riders, of warriors and
fighting men of every kind. This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
21 I shall display my glory among the
nations; all will see the judgement that I
execute and the hand I lay upon them.
22 From that day forward the Israelites
will know that I am the LORD their God,Ezekiel 39.23–28
150
23 and the nations will know that the
Israelites went into exile for their iniquity
in being unfaithful to me. I hid my face
from them and handed them over to
their enemies, and they fell, every one
of them, by the sword.
24 I dealt out to them what their
defilement and rebelliousness deserved,
and I hid my face from them.
25 The Lord GOD says: Now I shall
restore the fortunes of Jacob and show
my compassion for all Israel, and I shall
be jealous for my holy name.
26 They will forget their shame and
all their unfaithfulness to me, when
they live once more in their homeland
undisturbed and free from terror.
27 When I bring them back from the
nations and gather them from the lands
of their enemies, I shall make them
exemplify my holiness for many nations
to see.
28 They will know that I am the LORD
their God, because, having sent them
into exile among the nations, I bring
them together again in their homeland
and leave none of them behind.Ezekiel 39.29–40.5
151
29 No longer shall I hide my face from
them, I who have poured out my spirit
on Israel. This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
1 AT the beginning of the year,
on the tenth day of the month, in
the twenty-fifth year of our exile, that is
fourteen years after the city had fallen,
on that very day the hand of the LORD
came upon me and he brought me there.
2 In a vision from God I was brought to
the land of Israel and set on a very high
mountain, on which were what seemed
to be the buildings of a city to the south.
3 He led me towards it, and I saw a man
like a figure of bronze standing at the
gate and holding a cord of linen thread
and a measuring rod.
4 O man, he said to me, look closely
and listen carefully; note well all that
I show you, for this is why you have
been brought here. Tell the Israelites
everything you see.
5 Right round the outside of the temple
ran a wall. The length of the rod which
the man was holding was six cubits,
reckoning by the long cubit which was
one cubit and a hand's breadth. He
40Ezekiel 40.6–11
152
measured the thickness and the height
of the wall; each was one rod.
6 The man went to the gate which faced
eastwards, and mounting its steps he
measured the threshold of the gateway;
its depth was one rod.
7 Each cell was one rod long and one
rod wide; and there was a space of five
cubits between the cells. The threshold
of the gateway at the end of the vestibule
on the side facing the temple was one
rod.
8 He measured the vestibule of the
gateway
9 and it was eight cubits, with pilasters
two cubits thick; the vestibule of the
gateway lay at the end nearer the
temple.
10 Now the cells of the gateway, looking
back eastwards, were three in number
on each side, all of the same size, and
their pilasters on either side were also
identical in size.
11 He measured the entrance to the
gateway; it was ten cubits wide, and the
width of the gateway itself throughout
its length was thirteen cubits.Ezekiel 40.12–19
153
12 In front of the cells on each side lay
a kerb, one cubit wide; each cell was six
cubits by six.
13 He measured the width of the
gateway through the cell doors which
faced one another, from the back of one
cell to the back of the opposite cell; he
made it twenty-five cubits,
14 and the vestibule twenty cubits
across; the gateway on every side
projected into the court.
15 From the front of the entrance gate
to the outer face of the vestibule of the
inner gate the distance was fifty cubits.
16 Both cells and pilasters had
embrasures all round inside the gateway,
and the vestibule had windows all round
within, and each pilaster was decorated
with carved palm trees.
17 The man brought me to the outer
court, and I saw rooms and a pavement
all round the court: there were thirty
rooms along the pavement.
18 The pavement ran up to the side
of the gateways, as wide as they were
long; this was the lower pavement.
19 He measured the width of the court
from the front of the lower gateway toEzekiel 40.20–25
154
the outside of the inner gateway; it was
a hundred cubits. The man led me round
to the north
20 and I saw a gateway facing north
belonging to the outer court, and he
measured its length and its breadth.
21 Its cells, three on each side, together
with its pilasters and its vestibule, were
the same size as those of the first
gateway, fifty cubits long by twenty-five
wide.
22 So too its windows, and those of its
vestibule, and its palm trees were the
same size as those of the gateway which
faced east; it was approached by seven
steps with its vestibule facing them.
23 A gate like that on the east side led
to the inner court opposite the north
gateway; he measured from gateway to
gateway, and it was a hundred cubits.
24 Then the man led me round to
the south, where I saw a gateway
facing south. He measured its cells, its
pilasters, and its vestibule, and found it
the same size as the others,
25 fifty cubits long by twenty-five wide.
Both gateway and vestibule had windows
all round like the others.Ezekiel 40.26–33
155
26 It was approached by seven steps
with a vestibule facing them and palms
carved on each pilaster.
27 The inner court had a gateway facing
south, and when he measured from
gateway to gateway it was a hundred
cubits.
28 The man brought me into the inner
court through the south gateway,
measured it, and found it the same size
as the others.
29 So were its cells, pilasters, and
vestibule, fifty cubits long by twenty-five
wide. The court and its vestibule had
windows all round.
30 [[EMPTY]]
31 Its vestibule faced the outer court; it
had palm trees carved on its pilasters,
and eight steps led up to it.
32 The man brought me to the inner
court on the east side and measured the
gateway, and he found it the same size
as the others.
33 So too were its cells, pilasters,
and vestibule; it and its vestibule had
windows all round, and it was fifty cubits
long by twenty-five wide.Ezekiel 40.34–40
156
34 Its vestibule gave on to the outer
court and had a palm tree carved on
each pilaster; eight steps led up to it.
35 Then the man brought me to the
north gateway and measured it and
found it the same size as the others.
36 So were its cells, pilasters, and
vestibule, and it had windows all round;
it was fifty cubits long by twenty-five
wide.
37 Its vestibule faced the outer court
and had palm trees carved on the
pilaster at each side; eight steps led up
to it.
38 Opening off the vestibule of the
gateway was a room in which the
whole-offerings were to be washed.
39 On each side at the vestibule
were two tables where the whole-
offering, the purification-offering, and
the reparation-offering were to be
slaughtered.
40 At the corner on the outside, on the
way up to the entrance of the north
gateway, stood two tables, and two more
at the other corner of the vestibule of
the gateway;Ezekiel 40.41–46
157
41 another four stood on each side at
the corner of the gateway -- eight tables
in all, at which the slaughtering was to
be done.
42 Four tables used for the whole-
offering were of hewn stone, each one
and a half cubits long by one and a half
cubits wide and a cubit high; and on
them they put the instruments used for
the whole-offering and other sacrifices.
43 The flesh of the offerings was on
the tables, and rims a hand's breadth
in width were fixed all round facing
inwards.
44 Then the man brought me right into
the inner court, where there were two
rooms, one at the corner of the north
gateway, facing south, and one at the
corner of the south gateway, facing
north.
45 This room facing south, the man told
me, is for the priests in charge of the
temple buildings.
46 The room facing north is for the
priests in charge of the altar: that is,
the descendants of Zadok, who alone of
the Levites may come near to serve the
LORD.Ezekiel 40.47–41.3
158
47 He measured the court; it was
square, a hundred cubits each way, and
the altar stood in front of the temple.
48 The man brought me into the
vestibule of the temple, and measured
a pilaster of the vestibule; it was five
cubits on each side. The width of the
gateway was fourteen cubits, and that of
the corners of the gateway three cubits
in each direction.
49 The vestibule was twenty cubits long
by twelve wide; ten steps led up to it,
and by the pilasters rose pillars, one on
either side.
1 He brought me into the
sanctuary and measured the
pilasters; they were six cubits wide on
each side.
2 The entrance was ten cubits wide
and its corners five cubits wide in each
direction. He measured the length of the
sanctuary; it was forty cubits, and its
width twenty.
3 He went into the inner sanctuary and
measured the pilasters at the entrance:
they were two cubits; the entrance
itself was six cubits, and the corners of
41Ezekiel 41.4– 8
159
the entrance were seven cubits in each
direction.
4 Then he measured the room at the
far end of the sanctuary; its length and
its breadth were each twenty cubits. He
said to me, This is the Holy of Holies.
5 The man measured the wall of the
temple; it was six cubits high, and each
arcade all round the temple was four
cubits wide.
6 The arcades were arranged in three
tiers, each tier in thirty sections. In the
wall all round the temple there were
rebatements for the arcades, so that
they could be supported without being
fastened into the wall of the temple.
7 The higher up the arcades were,
the broader they were all round by
the addition of the rebatements, one
above the other all round the temple;
the temple itself had a ramp running
upwards on a base, and in this way
there was access from the lowest to the
highest tier by way of the middle tier.
8 I saw the temple had a raised
pavement all round it, and the
foundations of the arcades were flushEzekiel 41.9–15
160
with it and measured a full rod, six cubits
high.
9 The outer wall of the arcades was five
cubits thick. There was an unoccupied
area beside the terrace which was
adjacent to the temple,
10 There was a free space twenty cubits
wide all round the temple.
11 and the arcades opened on to this
area, one opening facing north and one
south; the unoccupied area was five
cubits wide on all sides.
12 On the western side, at the far end of
the free space, stood a building seventy
cubits wide; its wall was five cubits thick
all round, and its length ninety cubits.
13 The man measured the temple; it
was a hundred cubits long; the free
space, the building, and its walls came
to a hundred cubits in all.
14 The east front of the temple along
with the free space was a hundred cubits
wide.
15 He measured the length of the
building at the far end of the free
space to the west of the temple, and its
corridors on each side: a hundred cubits.Ezekiel 41.16–22
161
The sanctuary, the inner shrine, and the
outer vestibule were panelled;
16 the embrasures around the three of
them were framed with wood all round.
From the ground up to the windows
17 and above the door, in both the inner
and outer chambers, round all the walls,
inside and out,
18 were carved figures, cherubim and
palm trees, one palm tree between every
pair of cherubim. Each cherub had two
faces:
19 one the face of a man, looking
towards one palm tree, and the other
the face of a lion, looking towards the
palm tree on its other side. Such was the
carving round the whole of the temple.
20 The cherubim and the palm trees
were carved on the walls from the
ground up to the top of the doorway.
21 The doorposts of the sanctuary were
square. In front of the Holy Place was
what seemed
22 an altar of wood, three cubits high
and two cubits long; it was fitted with
corner-posts, and its base and sides also
were of wood. He told me that this was
the table which stands before the LORD.Ezekiel 41.23–42.4
162
23 The sanctuary had a double door, as
also had the Holy Place:
24 the double doors had hinged leaves,
a pair for each door.
25 Carved on them were cherubim
and palm trees like those on the walls.
Outside there was a wooden cornice over
the vestibule;
26 on both sides of the vestibule were
embrasures, with palm trees carved at
the corners.
1 Then the man took me to the
outer court round by the north
and brought me to the rooms facing the
free space and facing the buildings to
the north.
2 The length along the northern side
was a hundred cubits, and the breadth
fifty.
3 Facing the twenty cubits of free
space which adjoined the inner court,
and facing the pavement of the outer
court, were corridors at three levels
corresponding to each other.
4 In front of the rooms a passage,
ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits
long, ran towards the inner court; the
entrances to the rooms faced north.
42Ezekiel 42.5–12
163
5 The upper rooms were narrower than
the lower and middle rooms, because
the corridors took building space from
them.
6 For they were all at three levels and
had no pillars such as the courts had, so
that the lower and middle levels were
recessed from the ground upwards.
7 An outside wall, fifty cubits long, ran
parallel to the rooms and in front of
them, on the side of the outer court,
8 and while the rooms adjacent to the
outer court were fifty cubits long, those
facing the sanctuary were a hundred
cubits.
9 Below these rooms was an entry from
the east on the way in from the outer
court
10 where the wall of the court began.
On the south side, adjacent to the free
space and the building,
11 were other rooms with a passage
in front of them. These rooms
corresponded, in length and breadth
and in general character, to those facing
north,
12 whose exits and entrances were
the same as those of the rooms onEzekiel 42.13–16
164
the south. On the eastern approach,
where the passages began, there was an
entrance in the face of the inner wall.
13 The man said to me, The north and
south rooms facing the free space are
the consecrated rooms where the priests
who approach the LORD are to eat the
most sacred offerings. There they are
to put these offerings as well as the
grain-offering, the purification-offering,
and the reparation-offering; for the place
is holy.
14 When the priests have entered the
Holy Place they must not go into the
outer court again without leaving there
the vestments they have worn while
performing their duties. Those are holy
vestments and they are to put on other
garments before going to the place
assigned to the people.
15 When the man had finished
measuring the inner temple, he brought
me out through the gateway which faces
east and measured the whole area.
16 He measured the east side with the
measuring rod, and it was five hundred
cubits. He turnedEzekiel 42.17–43.5
165
17 and measured the north side with his
rod, and it was five hundred cubits. He
turned to
18 the south side and measured it with
his rod; it was five hundred cubits.
19 He turned to the west and measured
it with his rod; it was five hundred cubits.
20 So he measured all four sides of
the enclosing wall; in each direction
it measured five hundred cubits. This
marked off the sacred area from the
secular.
1 The man led me to the gate
which faced east,
2 and there, coming from the east, was
the glory of the God of Israel. The sound
of his coming was like that of a mighty
torrent, and the earth was bright with
his glory.
3 The form that I saw was the same as I
had seen when he came to destroy the
city, the same I had seen by the river
Kebar, and I prostrated myself.
4 As the glory of the LORD came to the
temple by the east gate,
5 a spirit lifted me up and brought me
into the inner court, and I saw the glory
of the LORD fill the temple.
43Ezekiel 43.6–11
166
6 With the man standing beside me I
heard someone speak to me from the
temple
7 and say, O man, do you see the place
of my throne, the place where I set my
feet, and where I shall dwell among
the Israelites for ever? Neither they nor
their kings must ever defile my holy
name again with their wanton idolatry,
and with the monuments raised to dead
kings.
8 They set their threshold by mine and
their doorpost beside mine, with only a
wall between me and them. They defiled
my holy name with the abominations
they committed; so I destroyed them in
my anger.
9 But now they must put away their
wanton idolatry and remove the
monuments to their kings far from me,
and I shall dwell among them for ever.
10 Tell the Israelites, O man, about this
temple, that they may be ashamed of
their iniquities.
11 If they are ashamed of all they have
done, you are to describe to them the
temple and its fittings, its exits and
entrances, all the details and particularsEzekiel 43.12–17
167
of its elevation and plan. Make a sketch
for them to look at, so that they may
keep them in mind and carry them out.
12 This is the plan of the temple to be
built on the top of the mountain: all its
precincts on every side shall be most
holy.
13 These were the dimensions of the
altar in cubits (the cubit that is a cubit
and a hand's breadth). This was the
height of the altar: the base was a cubit
high and projected a cubit; on its edge
was a rim one span deep.
14 From the base to the cubit-wide
ridge of the lower pedestal-block was
two cubits, and from this smaller
pedestal-block to the cubit-wide ridge
of the larger pedestal-block was four
cubits.
15 The altar-hearth was four cubits high
and was surmounted by four horns a
cubit high.
16 The hearth was square, twelve cubits
long and twelve cubits wide.
17 The upper pedestal-block was
fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits
wide on its four sides, and the rim round
it was half a cubit deep. The base of theEzekiel 43.18–22
168
altar projected a cubit, and there were
steps facing east.
18 He said to me, O man, the Lord
GOD says: Here are the regulations for
the altar when it has been made, for
sacrificing whole-offerings on it and for
flinging the blood against it.
19 Only the levitical priests of the
family of Zadok may come near to
serve me, says the Lord GOD. You
are to assign them a young bull for a
purification-offering;
20 you must take some of the blood and
apply it to the four horns of the altar, on
the four corners of the upper pedestal,
and all round the rim, and so purify and
make expiation for the altar.
21 Then take the bull chosen as the
purification-offering, and let the priests
destroy it by fire in the proper place
within the precincts, but outside the Holy
Place.
22 On the following day you are to
present a he-goat without blemish as a
purification-offering, and with it they are
to purify the altar as they did with the
bull.Ezekiel 43.23–44.2
169
23 When you have completed the
purifying of the altar, you are to present
a young bull without blemish and a ram
without blemish.
24 Present them before the LORD, and
have the priests throw salt on them and
sacrifice them as a whole-offering to the
LORD.
25 For seven days you are to offer a
goat as a daily purification-offering, as
well as a young bull, and a ram without
blemish from the flock.
26 For seven days they are to make
expiation for the altar, and, having
pronounced it ritually clean, they are to
consecrate it.
27 At the end of that time, on the eighth
day and onwards, the priests will sacrifice
on the altar your whole-offerings and
your shared-offerings, and I shall accept
you. This is the word of the Lord GOD.
1 The man again brought me
round to the outer gate of the
sanctuary facing east. It was shut, and
2 he said to me, This gate is to be kept
closed and is not to be opened. No one
may enter by it, for the LORD the God of
44Ezekiel 44.3– 8
170
Israel has entered by it. It must be kept
shut.
3 Only the ruling prince himself may sit
there to eat the sacrificial meal in the
presence of the LORD. He is to come in
and go out by the vestibule of the gate.
4 The man brought me round by the
north gate to the front of the temple, and
I saw the glory of the LORD filling the
LORD's house, and I prostrated myself.
5 He said to me, Note carefully, O man,
look closely, and listen attentively to all
I say to you, to all the rules and the
regulations for the LORD's house. Take
note of the entrance to the house and all
the exits from the sanctuary.
6 Say to Israel: The Lord GOD says:
Enough of all those abominations of
yours, you Israelites!
7 You admit foreigners, uncircumcised
in mind and body, into my sanctuary, so
defiling my house, when you present to
me the fat and blood which are my food.
They have made my covenant void with
your abominations.
8 Instead of keeping charge of my holy
things yourselves, you have put these
men in charge of my sanctuary.Ezekiel 44.9–14
171
9 The Lord GOD says: No foreigner,
uncircumcised in mind and body, who
may be living among the Israelites is to
enter my sanctuary.
10 But the Levites, though they deserted
me when the Israelites went astray
after their idols and had to bear the
punishment of their iniquity,
11 may yet be servants in my sanctuary,
having charge of the gates of the temple
and serving in it. They are to slaughter
the whole-offering and the sacrifice for
the people and be in attendance to serve
them.
12 Because they served the Israelites in
the presence of their idols and caused
the people to fall into sin, I have sworn
with uplifted hand, says the Lord GOD,
that they shall bear the punishment of
their iniquity.
13 They shall not have access to me,
to serve me as priests; nor shall they
approach any of my holy or most holy
things. They shall bear the shame of the
abominable deeds they have committed.
14 I shall put them in charge of all the
work which has to be done in the temple.Ezekiel 44.15–19
172
15 But the levitical priests of the family
of Zadok who remained in charge of
my sanctuary when the Israelites went
astray from me, they shall approach and
serve me. They shall stand before me, to
present the fat and the blood, says the
Lord GOD.
16 It is they who are to enter my
sanctuary and approach my table to
serve me and keep my charge.
17 When they come to the gates of
the inner court they must put on linen
garments; they must wear no wool when
serving me at the gates of the inner
court and inside it.
18 They are to wear linen turbans, and
have linen drawers on their loins; they
must not fasten their clothes with a belt,
which might cause sweating.
19 Before going out to the people in
the outer court, they are to remove the
clothes they have worn while serving;
leaving them in the sacred rooms, they
are to put on other clothes, so that
they do not by means of their clothing
transmit holiness to the people.Ezekiel 44.20–27
173
20 They must neither shave their heads
nor let their hair grow long; they must
keep their hair trimmed.
21 No priest may drink wine when he is
to enter the inner court.
22 He may not marry a widow or a
divorced woman, but only a virgin of
Israelite birth. He may, however, marry
the widow of a priest.
23 They are to teach my people to
distinguish the sacred from the profane,
and show them the difference between
unclean and clean.
24 When disputes arise, let them take
their place in court and decide each
case according to my laws. At all my
appointed seasons they must observe
my rules and statutes, and they are to
keep my sabbaths holy.
25 They must not defile themselves by
contact with any dead person, except
father or mother, son or daughter,
brother or unmarried sister.
26 After purification, they are to count
off seven days and then they will be
clean,
27 and when they re-enter the inner
court to serve in the Holy Place, theyEzekiel 44.28–45.2
174
are to present their purification-offering,
says the Lord GOD.
28 They are to own no holding in Israel;
I am their holding. No possession is to
be granted them in Israel; I am their
possession.
29 The grain-offering, the purification-
offering, and the reparation-offering are
to be eaten by them. Everything in Israel
devoted to God will be theirs.
30 The first of all the firstfruits and all
your contributions of every kind are to
belong wholly to the priests. You must
give the first lump of your dough to the
priests, so that a blessing may rest on
your house.
31 The priests must eat nothing,
whether bird or beast, which has died
a natural death or been killed by a wild
animal.
1 When you divide the land by lot
among the tribes, you are to set
apart for the LORD a sacred reserve,
twenty-five thousand cubits in length
and twenty thousand in width; the whole
area is to be sacred.
2 Of this a square plot, five hundred
cubits each way, must be devoted to the
45Ezekiel 45.3– 7
175
sanctuary, with fifty cubits of open land
round it.
3 From the area set apart, measure off
a space twenty-five thousand cubits by
ten thousand cubits, within which the
sanctuary, the holiest place of all, will
stand.
4 This part is sacred and is for the
priests who serve in the sanctuary and
who come near to serve the LORD. It
will include room for their houses and a
sacred plot for the sanctuary.
5 An area of twenty-five thousand by
ten thousand cubits is to be for the
Levites, the temple servants, and on it
will stand the places in which they live.
6 You are to allot to the city an area of
five thousand by twenty-five thousand
cubits alongside the sacred reserve; this
will belong to all Israel.
7 On either side of the sacred reserve
and of the city's share the ruler is to
have land facing the sacred reserve and
the city's share, running westwards and
eastwards. It is to run alongside one of
the tribal portions, and extend from the
western to the eastern bordersEzekiel 45.8–15
176
8 of the land; it will be his share in
Israel. The rulers of Israel will never
oppress my people again, but they will
assign the land to Israel, tribe by tribe.
9 THE Lord GOD says: Enough, you
rulers of Israel! Have done with
lawlessness and robbery; do what is
right and just. Give up evicting my
people from their land, says the Lord
GOD.
10 Your scales must be honest, as must
your ephah and your bath.
11 There must be one standard for each,
taking each as the tenth of a homer, and
the homer must have its fixed standard.
12 Your shekel weight must contain
twenty gerahs, and your mina be the
sum of twenty and twenty-five and
fifteen shekels.
13 These are the contributions you are
to set aside: out of every homer of wheat
or of barley, one sixth of an ephah.
14 For oil the rule is one tenth of a bath
from every kor, at ten bath to the kor;
15 one sheep in every flock of two
hundred is to be reserved by every
Israelite clan. For a grain-offering, a
whole-offering, and a shared-offering, toEzekiel 45.16–20
177
make expiation for them, says the Lord
GOD,
16 all the people of the land must bring
this contribution to the ruler in Israel.
17 He is to be responsible for the
whole-offering, the grain-offering, and
the drink-offering, at pilgrim-feasts,
new moons, sabbaths, and every sacred
season observed by Israel. He himself is
to provide the purification-offering and
the grain-offering, the whole-offering
and the shared-offering, needed to make
expiation for Israel.
18 The Lord GOD says: On the first day
of the first month you are to take a
young bull without blemish and purify
the sanctuary.
19 The priest must take some of the
blood from the purification-offering and
put it on the doorposts of the temple, on
the four corners of the altar pedestal,
and on the gateposts of the inner court.
20 You are to do the same on the
seventh day of the month for the man
who has sinned through inadvertence
or ignorance. So you are to purify the
temple.Ezekiel 45.21–46.1
178
21 On the fourteenth day of the first
month you are to celebrate the pilgrim-
feast of Passover, and for the seven days
of the feast you must eat bread made
without yeast.
22 On that day the ruler is to provide a
bull as a purification-offering for himself
and for all the people.
23 During the seven days of the feast
he is to offer daily as a whole-offering to
the LORD seven bulls and seven rams,
all without blemish, and one he-goat
daily as a purification-offering.
24 With every bull and ram he is to
provide a grain-offering of one ephah,
together with a hin of oil for each ephah.
25 He is to do the same thing also for the
pilgrim-feast which falls on the fifteenth
day of the seventh month; this also will
last seven days, and he must provide
the same purification-offering and
whole-offering and the same quantity of
grain and oil.
1 The Lord GOD says: The east
gate of the inner court must
remain closed during the six working
days; it is to be opened only on the
sabbath and at new moon.
46Ezekiel 46.2– 7
179
2 When the ruler comes through the
porch of the gate from the outside, he is
to take his stand by the gatepost, while
the priests sacrifice his whole-offering
and shared-offerings. At the threshold of
the gate he is to bow down in worship
and then go out, but the gate is not to
be closed until evening.
3 On sabbaths and at new moons the
people also must bow down before the
LORD at the entrance to that gate.
4 On the sabbath the whole-offering
which the prince brings to the LORD is to
be six lambs without blemish and a ram
without blemish.
5 The grain-offering is to be an ephah
with the ram and whatever he can give
with the lambs, together with a hin of oil
to every ephah.
6 At the new moon it is to be a young
bull without blemish, six lambs and a
ram, all without blemish;
7 he is to provide as the grain-offering
one ephah with the bull and one ephah
with the ram, with the lambs whatever
he can afford, adding a hin of oil for
every ephah.Ezekiel 46.8–12
180
8 Whenever the ruler comes in, he is to
enter through the porch of the gate and
go out by the same way.
9 When the people come to worship
before the LORD on festal days, anyone
who enters by the north gate to worship
must leave by the south gate, and
anyone who enters by the south gate
must leave by the north gate. He is not
to turn back and go out through the gate
by which he came in but to continue in
the same direction.
10 The ruler will then be among them,
going in when they go in and coming out
when they come out.
11 At pilgrim-feasts and on festal days
the grain-offering is to be an ephah with
a bull, an ephah with a ram, and as much
as he can afford with a lamb, together
with a hin of oil for every ephah.
12 When the ruler provides a whole-
offering or shared-offerings as a
voluntary sacrifice to the LORD, the
east gate is to be opened for him, and
he will make his whole-offering and
his shared-offerings as he does on the
sabbath. When he goes out, the gate
must be closed behind him.Ezekiel 46.13–18
181
13 You must provide a yearling lamb
without blemish daily as a whole-offering
to the LORD; you are to provide it every
morning.
14 With it every morning you must
provide as a grain-offering one sixth of
an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to
moisten the flour. The LORD's grain-
offering is an observance prescribed for
all time.
15 Every morning, as a regular whole-
offering, a lamb is to be offered with the
grain-offering and the oil.
16 The Lord GOD says: If the ruler
makes a gift out of his property to any of
his sons, it will belong to his sons, since
it is part of the family property.
17 But when he makes such a gift to
one of his slaves, it will belong to the
slave only until the year of manumission,
when it will revert to the ruler; it is the
property of his sons and will belong to
them.
18 The ruler must not oppress the people
by taking any part of their holdings of
land; he is to endow his sons from his
own property, so that my people may
not be deprived of their holdings.Ezekiel 46.19–47.1
182
19 Then the man brought me through
the entrance by the side of the gate to
the rooms which face north, the rooms
set apart for the priests, and, pointing to
a place on their west side,
20 he said to me, This is the place where
the priests boil the reparation-offering
and the purification-offering and bake
the grain-offering; they may not take
it into the outer court, for fear of
transmitting holiness to the people.
21 The man then brought me out into
the outer court and led me across to
the four corners of the court, at each of
which there was a further court.
22 These four courts were vaulted and
were the same size, forty cubits long by
thirty cubits wide.
23 Round each of the four was a
course of stonework, with fire-places
constructed close up against the stones.
24 These are the kitchens, he said,
where the attendants boil the people's
sacrifices.
1 The man brought me back to
the entrance of the temple, and
I saw a spring of water issuing towards
the east from under the threshold of the
47Ezekiel 47.2– 8
183
temple; for the temple faced east. The
water was running down along the south
side, to the right of the altar.
2 He took me out through the north gate
and led me round by an outside path to
the east gate of the court, and I saw
water was trickling from the south side.
3 With a line in his hand the man went
out eastwards, and he measured off
a thousand cubits and made me walk
through the water; it came up to my
ankles.
4 Again he measured a thousand cubits
and made me walk through the water;
it came up to my knees. He measured
another thousand and made me walk
through the water; it was up to my
waist.
5 He measured another thousand, and
it was a torrent I could not cross; the
water had risen and was deep enough to
swim in, a torrent impossible to cross.
6 Take note of this, O man, he said, and
led me back to the bank.
7 When I got to the bank I saw a great
number of trees on each side.
8 He said to me, This water flows out to
the region lying east, and down to theEzekiel 47.9–13
184
Arabah; it will run into the sea whose
waters are noxious, and they will be
made fresh.
9 When any one of the living creatures
that swarm upon the earth comes where
the torrent flows, it will draw life from it.
Fish will be plentiful, for wherever these
waters come the sea will be made fresh,
and where the torrent flows everything
will live.
10 From En-gedi as far as En-eglaim
fishermen will stand on its shores and
spread their nets. All kinds of fish will be
there in shoals, like the fish of the Great
Sea.
11 Its swamps and pools will not have
their waters made fresh; they will be left
to serve as salt-pans.
12 Beside the torrent on either bank
fruitful trees of every kind will grow.
Their leaves will not wither, nor will their
fruit fail; they will bear fruit early every
month, for the water for them flows from
the sanctuary; their fruit is for food and
their leaves for healing.
13 THE Lord GOD says: Here are the
boundaries within which the twelve tribesEzekiel 47.14–19
185
of Israel will enter into possession of the
land, Joseph receiving two portions.
14 The land which I swore with hand
uplifted to give to your forefathers you
are to divide with each other; it must be
assigned to you by lot as your holding.
15 This is the frontier: on its northern
side, from the Great Sea through
Hethlon, Lebo-hamath,
16 Zedad, Berothah, and Sibraim,
located between the frontiers of
Damascus and Hamath, to Hazar-enan,
near the frontier of Hauran.
17 The frontier will extend from the
sea to Hazar-enan on the frontier of
Damascus and northwards; this is its
northern side.
18 The eastern side runs alongside the
territories of Hauran, Damascus, and
Gilead, and alongside the territory of
Israel; Jordan forms the boundary to the
eastern sea, to Tamar. This is the eastern
boundary.
19 The southern side runs from Tamar
to the waters of Meribah-by-Kadesh; the
region assigned to you reaches the Great
Sea. This is the southern side towards
the Negeb.Ezekiel 47.20–48.2
186
20 The western side is the Great Sea,
which forms a boundary as far as a
point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the
western side.
21 You are to distribute this land among
the tribes of Israel
22 and assign it by lot as a share for
yourselves and for any aliens who are
living in your midst and have children
among you. They are to be treated like
native-born Israelites and receive with
you a share by lot among the tribes of
Israel.
23 You are to give the alien his share in
whatever tribe he is resident. This is the
word of the Lord GOD.
1 These are the names of the
tribes: In the extreme north, in
the direction of Hethlon, to Lebo-hamath
and Hazar-enan, with Damascus on
the northern frontier in the direction
of Hamath, and so from the eastern
boundary to the western, will be Dan:
one portion.
2 Bordering on Dan, from the eastern
boundary to the western, will be Asher:
one portion.
48Ezekiel 48.3–10
187
3 Bordering on Asher, from the eastern
boundary to the western, will be
Naphtali: one portion.
4 Bordering on Naphtali, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Manasseh: one portion.
5 Bordering on Manasseh, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Ephraim: one portion.
6 Bordering on Ephraim, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Reuben: one portion.
7 Bordering on Reuben, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Judah: one portion.
8 Bordering on Judah, from the eastern
boundary to the western, will be the
sacred reserve which you must set
apart. Its breadth will be twenty-five
thousand cubits and its length the same
as that of the tribal portions, from the
eastern boundary to the western, and
the sanctuary is to be in the centre of it.
9 The reserve which you must set apart
for the LORD is to measure twenty-five
thousand cubits by twenty thousand.
10 The reserve is to be apportioned
thus: the priests will have an areaEzekiel 48.11–15
188
measuring twenty-five thousand cubits
on the north side, ten thousand on the
west, ten thousand on the east, and
twenty-five thousand in length on the
south side; the sanctuary of the LORD is
to be in the centre of it.
11 It is to be for the consecrated priests
of the family of Zadok, who kept my
charge and did not follow the Israelites
when they went astray, as the Levites
did.
12 The area set apart for the priests
from the reserved territory will be most
sacred, adjoining the territory of the
Levites.
13 The Levites are to have a portion
running parallel to the border of the
priests. It is to be twenty-five thousand
cubits long by ten thousand wide;
altogether, the length is to be twenty-five
thousand cubits and the breadth ten
thousand.
14 They must neither sell nor exchange
any part of it; it is the best of the land
and must not be alienated, for it is holy
to the LORD.
15 The remaining strip, five thousand
cubits in width by twenty-five thousand,Ezekiel 48.16–21
189
is the city's secular land for dwellings
and common land. The city will be in the
middle,
16 and these are to be its dimensions:
on the northern side four thousand
five hundred cubits, on the southern
side four thousand five hundred cubits,
on the eastern side four thousand five
hundred cubits, on the western side four
thousand five hundred cubits.
17 The common land belonging to the
city is to be two hundred and fifty cubits
to the north, two hundred and fifty to the
south, two hundred and fifty to the east,
and two hundred and fifty to the west.
18 What is left parallel to the reserve,
ten thousand cubits to the east and ten
thousand to the west, will provide food
for those who work in the city.
19 Those who work in the city are to
cultivate it; they may be drawn from any
of the tribes of Israel.
20 You are to set apart as sacred the
whole reserve, twenty-five thousand
cubits square, as far as the holding of
the city.
21 What is left over on either side of the
sacred reserve and the city holding isEzekiel 48.22–26
190
to be assigned to the ruler. Eastwards,
what lies over against the reserved
twenty-five thousand cubits, as far as the
eastern side, and westwards, what lies
over against the twenty-five thousand
cubits to the western side, parallel to
the tribal portions, is to be assigned to
the ruler; the sacred reserve and the
sanctuary itself will be in the centre.
22 The holding of the Levites and the
holding of the city will be in the middle
of that which is assigned to the ruler; it
will be between the frontiers of Judah
and Benjamin.
23 The rest of the tribes: from the
eastern boundary to the western will be
Benjamin: one portion.
24 Bordering on Benjamin, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Simeon: one portion.
25 Bordering on Simeon, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Issachar: one portion.
26 Bordering on Issachar, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Zebulun: one portion.Ezekiel 48.27–34
191
27 Bordering on Zebulun, from the
eastern boundary to the western, will be
Gad: one portion.
28 Bordering on Gad, on the side of
the Negeb, the frontier on the south
stretches from Tamar to the waters of
Meribah-by-Kadesh, to the wadi of Egypt
as far as the Great Sea.
29 That is the land which you are to allot
as a holding to the tribes of Israel, and
those will be their allotted portions. This
is the word of the Lord GOD.
30 These are to be the ways out of the
city, the gates being named after the
tribes of Israel. The northern side, four
thousand five hundred cubits long, is
to have three gates, those of Reuben,
Judah, and Levi;
31 (48:30)
32 the eastern side, four thousand five
hundred cubits long, three gates, those
of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan;
33 the southern side, four thousand five
hundred cubits long, three gates, those
of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun;
34 the western side, four thousand five
hundred cubits long, three gates, those
of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.Ezekiel 48.35
192
35 The perimeter of the city will be
eighteen thousand cubits, and for all
time to come the city's name will be The
LORD is there.Daniel
1 IN the third year of the reign of King
1 Jehoiakim of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar,
the Babylonian king, came and laid siege
to Jerusalem.
2 The Lord handed King Jehoiakim over
to him, together with all that was left of
the vessels from the house of God; and
he carried them off to the land of Shinar,
to the temple of his god, where he placed
the vessels in the temple treasury.
3 The king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief
eunuch, to bring into the palace some
of the Israelite exiles, members of their
royal house and of the nobility.
4 They were to be young men free
from physical defect, handsome in
appearance, at home in all branches of
knowledge, well-informed, intelligent,
and so fitted for service in the royal
court; and he was to instruct them in the
writings and language of the Chaldaeans.
5 The king assigned them a daily
allowance of fine food and wine from the
royal table, and their training was to lastDaniel 1.6–11
2
for three years; at the end of that time
they would enter his service.
6 Among them were certain Jews:
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
7 To them the master of the eunuchs
gave new names: Daniel he called
Belteshazzar, Hananiah Shadrach,
Mishael Meshach, and Azariah Abed-
nego.
8 Daniel determined not to become
contaminated with the food and wine
from the royal table, and begged the
master of the eunuchs to excuse him
from touching it.
9 God caused the master to look on
Daniel with kindness and goodwill,
10 and to Daniel's request he replied, I
am afraid of my lord the king: he has
assigned you food and drink, and if he
were to see you and your companions
looking miserable compared with the
other young men of your own age, my
head would be forfeit.
11 Then Daniel said to the attendant
whom the master of the eunuchs had put
in charge of Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah,
and himself,Daniel 1.12–19
3
12 Submit us to this test for ten days:
give us only vegetables to eat and water
to drink;
13 then compare our appearance with
that of the young men who have lived on
the king's food, and be guided in your
treatment of us by what you see for
yourself.
14 He agreed to the proposal and
submitted them to this test.
15 At the end of the ten days they
looked healthier and better nourished
than any of the young men who had
lived on the food from the king.
16 So the attendant took away the food
assigned to them and the wine they were
to drink, and gave them vegetables only.
17 To all four of these young men
God gave knowledge, understanding of
books, and learning of every kind, and
Daniel had a gift for interpreting visions
and dreams of every kind.
18 At the time appointed by the king
for introducing the young men to court,
the master of the eunuchs brought them
into the presence of Nebuchadnezzar.
19 The king talked with them all, but
found none of them to compare withDaniel 1.20–2.5
4
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah;
so they entered the royal service.
20 Whenever the king consulted them
on any matter calling for insight and
judgement, he found them ten times
superior to all the magicians and
exorcists in his whole kingdom.
21 Daniel remained there until the
accession of King Cyrus.
1 IN the second year of his reign
Nebuchadnezzar was troubled by
dreams he had, so much so that he could
not sleep.
2 He gave orders for the magicians,
exorcists, sorcerers, and Chaldaeans
to be summoned to expound to him
what he had been dreaming. When they
presented themselves before the king,
3 he said to them, I have had a dream,
and my mind has been troubled to know
what the dream was.
4 The Chaldaeans, speaking in Aramaic,
said, Long live the king! Relate the
dream to us, your servants, and we shall
give you the interpretation.
5 The king answered, This is my firm
decision: if you do not make both dream
and interpretation known to me, you
2Daniel 2.6–10
5
will be hacked limb from limb and your
houses will be reduced to rubble.
6 But if you tell me the dream and
its interpretation, you will be richly
rewarded by me and loaded with
honours. Tell me, then, the dream and
its interpretation.
7 They said again, Let the king relate
the dream to his servants, and we shall
tell him the interpretation.
8 The king rejoined, It is clear to me
that you are trying to gain time, because
you see that I have come to this firm
decision:
9 if you do not make the dream known
to me, there is but one verdict for you,
and one only. What is more, you have
conspired to tell me mischievous lies
to my face in the hope that with time
things may alter. Relate the dream to
me, therefore, and then I shall know
that you can give me its interpretation.
10 The Chaldaeans answered, No one
on earth can tell your majesty what
you wish to know. No king, however
great and powerful, has ever made such
a demand of a magician, exorcist, or
Chaldaean.Daniel 2.11–18
6
11 What your majesty asks is too hard;
none but the gods can tell you, and they
dwell remote from mortals.
12 At this the king became furious, and
in great rage he ordered all the wise men
of Babylon to be put to death.
13 A decree was issued for the execution
of the wise men, and search was made
for Daniel and his companions.
14 As Arioch, captain of the royal
bodyguard, set out to execute the wise
men of Babylon, Daniel made a discreet
and tactful approach to him.
15 He said, May I ask you, sir, as the
king's representative, why his majesty
has issued so peremptory a decree?
Arioch explained the matter,
16 and Daniel went to the king and
begged to be allowed a certain time
by which he would give the king the
interpretation.
17 He then went home and made the
matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah, his companions, saying
18 they should implore the God of
heaven to disclose this secret in his
mercy, so that they should not be putDaniel 2.19–24
7
to death along with the rest of the wise
men of Babylon.
19 The secret was then revealed to
Daniel in a vision by night, and he
blessed the God of heaven
20 in these words: Blessed be God's
name from age to age, for to him belong
wisdom and power.
21 He changes seasons and times; he
deposes kings and sets up kings; he
gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge
to those who have discernment;
22 he reveals deep mysteries; he knows
what lies in darkness; with him light has
its dwelling.
23 God of my fathers, to you I give
thanks and praise, for you have given
me wisdom and power. Now you have
made known to me what we asked; you
have given us the answer for the king.
24 Daniel therefore went to Arioch,
whom the king had charged with the
execution of the wise men of Babylon.
He approached him and said, Do not
put the wise men to death; bring me
before the king and I shall tell him the
interpretation of his dream.Daniel 2.25–30
8
25 Greatly agitated, Arioch brought
Daniel before the king. I have found
among the Jewish exiles, he said, a man
who will make known to your majesty
the interpretation of your dream.
26 The king asked Daniel (who was also
called Belteshazzar), Are you able to
make known to me what I saw in my
dream and to interpret it?
27 Daniel answered: No wise man,
exorcist, magician, or diviner can tell
your majesty the secret about which you
ask.
28 But there is in heaven a God who
reveals secrets, and he has made known
to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to be
at the end of this age. This is the dream
and these are the visions that came into
your head:
29 the thoughts that came to you,
your majesty, as you lay on your bed,
concerned the future, and he who
reveals secrets has made known to you
what is to be.
30 This secret has been revealed to me,
not because I am wiser than anyone
alive, but in order that your majesty may
know the interpretation and understandDaniel 2.31–37
9
the thoughts which have entered your
mind.
31 As you watched, there appeared to
your majesty a great image. Huge and
dazzling, it stood before you, fearsome
to behold.
32 The head of the image was of fine
gold, its chest and arms of silver, its
belly and thighs of bronze,
33 its legs of iron, its feet part iron and
part clay.
34 While you watched, you saw a stone
hewn from a mountain by no human
hand; it struck the image on its feet of
iron and clay and shattered them.
35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze,
the silver, and the gold were all shattered
into fragments, and as if they were chaff
from a summer threshing-floor the wind
swept them away until no trace of them
remained. But the stone which struck
the image grew and became a huge
mountain and filled the whole earth.
36 That was the dream; now we shall
relate to your majesty its interpretation.
37 Your majesty, the king of kings, to
whom the God of heaven has given theDaniel 2.38–43
10
kingdom with its power, its might, and
its honour,
38 in whose hands he has placed
mankind wherever they live, the wild
animals, and the birds of the air, granting
you sovereignty over them all: you
yourself are that head of gold.
39 After you there will arise another
kingdom, inferior to yours, then a third
kingdom, of bronze, which will have
sovereignty over the whole world.
40 There will be a fourth kingdom,
strong as iron; just as iron shatters and
breaks all things, it will shatter and crush
all the others.
41 As in your vision the feet and toes
were part potter's clay and part iron, so
it will be a divided kingdom, and just as
you saw iron mixed with clay from the
ground, so it will have in it something of
the strength of iron.
42 The toes being part iron and part clay
means that the kingdom will be partly
strong and partly brittle.
43 As in your vision the iron was mixed
with the clay, so there will be a mixing
of families by intermarriage, but suchDaniel 2.44–48
11
alliances will not be stable: iron does not
mix with clay.
44 In the times of those kings the God
of heaven will establish a kingdom which
will never be destroyed, nor will it ever
pass to another people; it will shatter
all these kingdoms and make an end of
them, while it will itself endure for ever.
45 This is the meaning of your vision of
the stone being hewn from a mountain
by no human hand, and then shattering
the iron, the bronze, the clay, the
silver, and the gold. A mighty God has
made known to your majesty what
is to be hereafter. The dream and its
interpretation are true and trustworthy.
46 At this King Nebuchadnezzar
prostrated himself and did homage to
Daniel, and he gave orders that there
should be presented to him a tribute of
grain and soothing offerings.
47 Truly, he said, your God is indeed
God of gods and Lord over kings, and a
revealer of secrets, since you have been
able to reveal this secret.
48 The king then promoted Daniel to
high position and bestowed on him many
rich gifts. He gave him authority overDaniel 2.49–3.5
12
the whole province of Babylon and put
him in charge of all Babylon's wise men.
49 At Daniel's request the king appointed
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
to administer the province of Babylon,
while Daniel himself remained at court.
1 KING Nebuchadnezzar made a gold
image, ninety feet high and nine feet
broad, and had it set up on the plain of
Dura in the province of Babylon.
2 The king then summoned the satraps,
prefects, governors, counsellors,
treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all
the provincial officials to assemble and
attend the dedication of the image he
had set up.
3 The satraps, prefects, governors,
counsellors, treasurers, judges,
magistrates, and all governors of
provinces assembled for the dedication
of the image King Nebuchadnezzar had
set up, and they took their places in
front of the image.
4 A herald proclaimed in a loud voice,
Peoples and nations of every language,
you are commanded,
5 when you hear the sound of horn,
pipe, zither, triangle, dulcimer, a full
3Daniel 3.6–12
13
consort of music, to prostrate yourselves
and worship the gold image which King
Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
6 Whosoever does not prostrate himself
and worship will be thrown forthwith into
a blazing furnace.
7 Accordingly, no sooner did the sound
of horn, pipe, zither, triangle, dulcimer,
a full consort of music, reach them than
all the peoples and nations of every
language prostrated themselves and
worshipped the gold image set up by
King Nebuchadnezzar.
8 Some Chaldaeans seized the
opportunity to approach the king with a
malicious accusation against the Jews.
9 They said, Long live the king!
10 Your majesty has issued a decree
that everyone who hears the sound of
horn, pipe, zither, triangle, dulcimer, a
full consort of music, must fall down and
worship the gold image;
11 and whoever does not do so will be
thrown into a blazing furnace.
12 There are certain Jews whom you
have put in charge of the administration
of the province of Babylon. These men,
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,Daniel 3.13–17
14
have disregarded your royal command;
they do not serve your gods, nor do they
worship the gold image you set up.
13 In furious rage Nebuchadnezzar
ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego to be fetched, and when they
were brought into his presence,
14 he asked them, Is it true, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you do
not serve my gods or worship the gold
image which I have set up?
15 Now if you are ready to prostrate
yourselves as soon as you hear the
sound of horn, pipe, zither, triangle,
dulcimer, a full consort of music, and to
worship the image that I have made,
well and good. But if you do not worship
it, you will be thrown forthwith into the
blazing furnace; and what god is there
that can deliver you from my power?
16 Their reply to the king was: Your
majesty, we have no need to answer you
on this matter.
17 If there is a god who is able to save
us from the blazing furnace, it is our God
whom we serve; he will deliver us from
your majesty's power.Daniel 3.18–24
15
18 But if not, be it known to your
majesty that we shall neither serve your
gods nor worship the gold image you
have set up.
19 At this Nebuchadnezzar was furious
with them, and his face became distorted
with anger. He ordered that the furnace
should be heated to seven times its
usual heat,
20 and commanded some of the
strongest men in his army to bind
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego and
throw them into the blazing furnace.
21 Then, just as they were, in trousers,
shirts, headdresses, and their other
clothes, they were bound and thrown
into the furnace.
22 Because the king's order was
peremptory and the furnace exceedingly
hot, those who were carrying the three
men were killed by the flames;
23 and Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego fell bound into the blazing
furnace.
24 Then King Nebuchadnezzar, greatly
agitated, sprang to his feet, saying to his
courtiers, Was it not three men whomDaniel 3.25–28
16
we threw bound into the fire? They
answered, Yes, certainly, your majesty.
25 Yet, he insisted, I can see four men
walking about in the fire, free and
unharmed; and the fourth looks like a
god.
26 Nebuchadnezzar approached the
furnace door and called, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, servants of
the Most High God, come out! When
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
emerged from the fire,
27 the satraps, prefects, governors,
and the king's courtiers gathered round
them and saw how the fire had had no
power to harm their bodies. The hair of
their heads had not been singed, their
trousers were untouched, and no smell
of fire lingered about them.
28 Nebuchadnezzar declared: Blessed
be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego! He has sent his angel to
save his servants who, trusting in him,
disobeyed the royal command; they
were willing to submit themselves to the
fire rather than to serve or worship any
god other than their own God.Daniel 3.29–4.5
17
29 I therefore issue this decree: anyone,
whatever his people, nation, or language,
if he speaks blasphemy against the God
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
is to be hacked limb from limb and his
house is to be reduced to rubble; for
there is no other god who can save in
such a manner.
30 Then the king advanced the fortunes
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in
the province of Babylon.
1 KING Nebuchadnezzar to all
peoples and nations of every
language throughout the whole world:
May your prosperity increase!
2 It is my pleasure to recount the signs
and wonders which the Most High God
has worked for me:
3 How great are his signs, how
mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom, his sovereignty
endures through all generations.
4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living
contentedly at home in the luxury of my
palace,
5 but as I lay on my bed, I had a
dream which filled me with fear, and the
4Daniel 4.6–11
18
fantasies and visions which came into
my head caused me dismay.
6 I issued an order summoning to my
presence all the wise men of Babylon to
make known to me the interpretation of
the dream.
7 When the magicians, exorcists,
Chaldaeans, and diviners came in, I
related my dream to them, but they
were unable to interpret it for me.
8 Finally there came before me Daniel,
who is called Belteshazzar after the
name of my god, a man in whom resides
the spirit of the holy gods. To him also I
related the dream:
9 Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians,
you have in you, as I know, the spirit of
the holy gods, and no secret baffles you;
listen to what I saw in my dream, and
tell me its interpretation.
10 This is the vision which came to me
while I lay on my bed: As I was looking,
there appeared a very lofty tree at the
centre of the earth;
11 the tree grew great and became
strong; its top reached to the sky, and it
was visible to earth's farthest bounds.Daniel 4.12–17
19
12 Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit
abundant, and it yielded food for all.
Beneath it the wild beasts found shelter,
the birds lodged in the branches, and
from it all living creatures fed.
13 This is what I saw in the vision which
came to me while I lay on my bed: There
appeared a watcher, a holy one coming
down from heaven.
14 In a mighty voice he cried, Hew down
the tree, lop off the branches, strip away
its foliage and scatter the fruit; let the
wild beasts flee from beneath it and the
birds from its branches;
15 but leave the stump with its roots
in the ground. So, bound with iron and
bronze among the lush grass, let him
be drenched with the dew of heaven
and share the lot of the beasts in their
pasture --
16 his mind will cease to be human, and
he will be given the mind of a beast.
Seven times will pass over him.
17 The issue has been determined by the
watchers and the sentence pronounced
by the holy ones. Thereby the living will
know that the Most High is sovereign
in the kingdom of men: he gives theDaniel 4.18–22
20
kingdom to whom he wills, and may
appoint over it the lowliest of mankind.
18 This is the dream which I, King
Nebuchadnezzar, dreamt; now,
Belteshazzar, tell me its interpretation,
for, though not one of the wise men in all
my kingdom is able to make its meaning
known to me, you can do it, because in
you is the spirit of the holy gods.
19 Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar,
was dumbfounded for a moment,
dismayed by his thoughts; but the
king said, Do not let the dream and its
interpretation dismay you. Belteshazzar
answered, My lord, if only the dream
applied to those who hate you and its
interpretation to your enemies!
20 The tree which you saw grow great
and become strong, reaching with its top
to the sky and visible to earth's farthest
bounds,
21 its foliage beautiful and its fruit
abundant, a tree which yielded food for
all, beneath which the wild beasts dwelt
and in whose branches the birds lodged:
22 that tree, your majesty, is you. You
have become great and strong; your
power has grown and reaches the sky;Daniel 4.23–26
21
your sovereignty extends to the ends of
the earth.
23 Also, your majesty, you saw a
watcher, a holy one, coming down from
heaven and saying, Hew down the tree
and destroy it, but leave the stump with
its roots in the ground. So, bound with
iron and bronze among the lush grass,
let him be drenched with the dew of
heaven and share the lot of the beasts
until seven times pass over him.
24 This is the interpretation, your
majesty: it is a decree of the Most High
which affects my lord the king.
25 You will be banished from human
society; you will be made to live with the
wild beasts; like oxen you will feed on
grass, and you will be drenched with the
dew of heaven. Seven times will pass
over you until you have acknowledged
that the Most High is sovereign over the
realm of humanity and gives it to whom
he wills.
26 As the command was given to leave
the stump of the tree with its roots, by
this you may know that from the time
you acknowledge the sovereignty of
Heaven your rule will endure.Daniel 4.27–33
22
27 Your majesty, be advised by me:
let charitable deeds replace your sins,
generosity to the poor your wrongdoing.
It may be that you will long enjoy
contentment.
28 All this befell King Nebuchadnezzar.
29 At the end of twelve months the king
was walking on the roof of the royal
palace at Babylon,
30 and he exclaimed, Is not this Babylon
the great which I have built as a royal
residence by my mighty power and for
the honour of my own majesty?
31 The words were still on his lips, when
there came a voice from heaven: To
you, King Nebuchadnezzar, the word is
spoken: the kingdom has passed from
you.
32 You are banished from human
society; you are to live with the wild
beasts and feed on grass like oxen.
Seven times will pass over you until you
have acknowledged that the Most High
is sovereign over the realm of humanity
and gives it to whom he will.
33 At that very moment this judgement
came upon Nebuchadnezzar: he was
banished from human society to eatDaniel 4.34–37
23
grass like oxen, and his body was
drenched with the dew of heaven, until
his hair became shaggy like an eagle and
his nails grew like birds' claws.
34 At the end of the appointed time,
I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up towards
heaven and I was restored to my
right mind. I blessed the Most High,
praising and glorifying the Ever-living
One: His sovereignty is everlasting
and his kingdom endures through all
generations.
35 All who dwell on earth count for
nothing; he does as he pleases with the
host of heaven and with those who dwell
on earth. No one can oppose his power
or question what he does.
36 At that very time I was restored
to my right mind and, for the glory of
my kingdom, my majesty and royal
splendour returned to me. My courtiers
and my nobles sought audience of me,
and I was re-established in my kingdom
and my power was greatly increased.
37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and
exalt and glorify the King of heaven; for
all his acts are right and his ways areDaniel 5.1–5
24
just, and he can bring low those whose
conduct is arrogant.
1 KING Belshazzar gave a grand
banquet for a thousand of his nobles
and he was drinking wine in their
presence.
2 Under the influence of the wine,
Belshazzar gave orders for the vessels
of gold and silver which his father
Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the
temple at Jerusalem to be fetched, so
that he and his nobles, along with his
concubines and courtesans, might drink
from them.
3 So those vessels belonging to the
house of God, the temple at Jerusalem,
were brought, and the king, the nobles,
and the concubines and courtesans
drank from them.
4 They drank their wine and they praised
their gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron,
wood, and stone.
5 Suddenly there appeared the fingers
of a human hand writing on the plaster
of the palace wall opposite the lamp, and
the king saw the palm of the hand as it
wrote.
5Daniel 5.6–11
25
6 At this the king turned pale; dismay
filled his mind, the strength went from
his legs, and his knees knocked together.
7 He called in a loud voice for the
exorcists, Chaldaeans, and diviners to be
brought in; then, addressing Babylon's
wise men, he said, Whoever reads this
writing and tells me its interpretation
shall be robed in purple and have a gold
chain hung round his neck, and he shall
rank third in the kingdom.
8 All the king's wise men came, but they
could neither read the writing nor make
known to the king its interpretation.
9 Then his deep dismay drove all colour
from King Belshazzar's cheeks, and his
nobles were in a state of confusion.
10 Drawn by what the king and his
nobles were saying, the queen entered
the banqueting hall: Long live the king!
she said. Why this dismay, and why do
you look so pale?
11 There is a man in your kingdom
who has the spirit of the holy gods in
him; he was known in your father's time
to possess clear insight and godlike
wisdom, so that King Nebuchadnezzar,
your father, appointed him chief of theDaniel 5.12–16
26
magicians, exorcists, Chaldaeans, and
diviners.
12 This Daniel, whom the king named
Belteshazzar, is known to have
exceptional ability, with knowledge and
insight, and the gift of interpreting
dreams, explaining riddles, and
unravelling problems; let him be
summoned now and he will give the
interpretation.
13 Daniel was then brought into the
royal presence, and the king addressed
him: So you are Daniel, one of the
Jewish exiles whom my royal father
brought from Judah.
14 I am informed that the spirit of the
gods resides in you and that you are
known as a man of clear insight and
exceptional wisdom.
15 The wise men, the exorcists, have
just been brought before me to read
this writing and make known its
interpretation to me, but they have been
unable to give its meaning.
16 I am told that you are able to furnish
interpretations and unravel problems.
Now, if you can read the writing and
make known the interpretation, you shallDaniel 5.17–21
27
be robed in purple and have a gold chain
hung round your neck, and you shall
rank third in the kingdom.
17 Daniel replied, Your majesty, I do
not look for gifts from you; give your
rewards to another. Nevertheless I shall
read your majesty the writing and make
known to you its interpretation.
18 My lord king, the Most High God
gave a kingdom with power, glory, and
majesty to your father Nebuchadnezzar;
19 and, because of the power he
bestowed on him, all peoples and nations
of every language trembled with fear
before him. He put to death whom he
would and spared whom he would, he
promoted them at will and at will abased
them.
20 But, when he became haughty and
stubborn and presumptuous, he was
deposed from his royal throne and
stripped of his glory.
21 He was banished from human society,
and his mind became like that of an
animal; he had to live with the wild
asses and to feed on grass like oxen,
and his body was drenched with the dew
of heaven, until he came to acknowledgeDaniel 5.22–27
28
that the Most High God is sovereign over
the realm of humanity and appoints over
it whom he will.
22 But although you knew all this, you,
his son Belshazzar, did not humble your
heart.
23 You have set yourself up against
the Lord of heaven; his temple vessels
have been fetched for you and your
nobles, your concubines and courtesans
to drink from them. You have praised
gods fashioned from silver, gold, bronze,
iron, wood, and stone, which cannot see
or hear or know, and you have not given
glory to God, from whom comes your
every breath, and in whose charge are
all your ways.
24 That is why he sent the hand and
why it wrote this inscription.
25 The words inscribed were: Mene
mene tekel u-pharsin.
26 Their interpretation is this: mene,
God has numbered the days of your
kingdom and brought it to an end;
27 tekel, you have been weighed in the
balance and found wanting;Daniel 5.28–6.4
29
28 u-pharsin, your kingdom has been
divided and given to the Medes and
Persians.
29 Then at Belshazzar's command Daniel
was robed in purple and a gold chain was
hung round his neck, and proclamation
was made that he should rank third in
the kingdom.
30 That very night Belshazzar king of
the Chaldaeans was slain,
31 and Darius the Mede took the
kingdom, being then about sixty-two
years old.
1 IT pleased Darius to appoint a
hundred and twenty satraps to be in
charge throughout his kingdom,
2 and over them three chief ministers,
to whom the satraps were to submit their
reports so that the king's interests might
not suffer; of these three ministers,
Daniel was one.
3 Daniel outshone the other ministers
and the satraps because of his
exceptional ability, and it was the king's
intention to appoint him over the whole
kingdom.
4 Then the ministers and satraps began
to look round for some pretext to attack
6Daniel 6.5–9
30
Daniel's administration of the kingdom,
but they failed to find any malpractice
on his part, for he was faithful to his
trust. Since they could discover neither
negligence nor malpractice,
5 they said, We shall not find any ground
for bringing a charge against this Daniel
unless it is connected with his religion.
6 These ministers and satraps, having
watched for an opportunity to approach
the king, said to him, Long live King
Darius!
7 We, the ministers of the kingdom,
prefects, satraps, courtiers, and
governors, have taken counsel and all
are agreed that the king should issue
a decree and bring into force a binding
edict to the effect that whoever presents
a petition to any god or human being
other than the king during the next thirty
days is to be thrown into the lion-pit.
8 Now let your majesty issue the edict
and have it put in writing so that it
becomes unalterable, for the law of
the Medes and Persians may never be
revoked.
9 Accordingly the edict was signed by
King Darius.Daniel 6.10–13
31
10 When Daniel learnt that this decree
had been issued, he went into his house.
It had in the roof-chamber windows
open towards Jerusalem; and there he
knelt down three times a day and offered
prayers and praises to his God as was
his custom.
11 His enemies, on the watch for an
opportunity to catch him, found Daniel
at his prayers making supplication to his
God.
12 They then went into the king's
presence and reminded him of the edict.
Your majesty, they said, have you not
issued an edict that any person who,
within the next thirty days, presents
a petition to any god or human being
other than your majesty is to be thrown
into the lion-pit? The king answered,
The matter has been determined in
accordance with the law of the Medes
and Persians, which may not be revoked.
13 So they said to the king, Daniel, one
of the Jewish exiles, has disregarded
both your majesty and the edict, and is
making petition to his God three times a
day.Daniel 6.14–20
32
14 When the king heard this, he was
greatly distressed; he tried to think of a
way to save Daniel, and continued his
efforts till sunset.
15 The men watched for an opportunity
to approach the king, and said to him,
Your majesty must know that by the
law of the Medes and Persians no edict
or decree issued by the king may be
altered.
16 Then the king gave the order for
Daniel to be brought and thrown into the
lion-pit; but he said to Daniel, Your God
whom you serve at all times, may he
save you.
17 A stone was brought and put over
the mouth of the pit, and the king sealed
it with his signet and with the signets of
his nobles, so that no attempt could be
made to rescue Daniel.
18 The king went to his palace and spent
the night fasting; no woman was brought
to him, and sleep eluded him.
19 He was greatly agitated and, at the
first light of dawn, he rose and went to
the lion-pit.
20 When he came near he called
anxiously, Daniel, servant of the livingDaniel 6.21–26
33
God, has your God whom you serve
continually been able to save you from
the lions?
21 Daniel answered, Long live the king!
22 My God sent his angel to shut
the lions mouths and they have not
injured me; he judged me innocent, and
moreover I had done your majesty no
injury.'
23 The king was overjoyed and gave
orders that Daniel should be taken up
out of the pit. When this was done
no trace of injury was found on him,
because he had put his faith in his God.
24 By order of the king those who out of
malice had accused Daniel were brought
and flung into the lion-pit along with
their children and their wives, and before
they reached the bottom the lions were
upon them and devoured them, bones
and all.
25 King Darius wrote to all peoples and
nations of every language throughout
the whole world: May your prosperity
increase!
26 I have issued a decree that in all my
royal domains everyone is to fear and
reverence the God of Daniel, for he isDaniel 6.27–7.5
34
the living God, the everlasting, whose
kingly power will never be destroyed;
whose sovereignty will have no end --
27 a saviour, a deliverer, a worker of
signs and wonders in heaven and on
earth, who has delivered Daniel from the
power of the lions.
28 Prosperity attended Daniel during the
reigns of Darius and Cyrus the Persian.
1 IN the first year that Belshazzar
was king of Babylon, a dream and
visions came to Daniel as he lay on his
bed. Then he wrote down the dream,
and here his account begins.
2 In my vision during the night while
I, Daniel, was gazing intently I saw the
Great Sea churned up by the four winds
of heaven,
3 and four great beasts rising out of the
sea, each one different from the others.
4 The first was like a lion, but it had an
eagle's wings. I watched until its wings
were plucked off and it was lifted from
the ground and made to stand on two
feet as if it were a human being; it was
also given the mind of a human being.
5 Then I saw another, a second beast,
like a bear. It had raised itself on one
7Daniel 7.6–9
35
side, and it had three ribs in its mouth
between its teeth. The command was
given to it: Get up and gorge yourself
with flesh.
6 After this as I gazed I saw another, a
beast like a leopard with four wings like
those of a bird on its back; this creature
had four heads, and it was invested with
sovereign power.
7 Next in the night visions I saw a
fourth beast, fearsome and grisly and
exceedingly strong, with great iron
teeth. It devoured and crunched, and it
trampled underfoot what was left. It was
different from all the beasts which went
before it, and had ten horns.
8 While I was considering the horns
there appeared another horn, a little
one, springing up among them, and
three of the first horns were uprooted
to make room for it. In this horn were
eyes like human eyes, and a mouth that
uttered bombast.
9 As I was looking, thrones were set
in place and the Ancient in Years took
his seat; his robe was white as snow,
his hair like lamb's wool. His throne wasDaniel 7.10–14
36
flames of fire and its wheels were blazing
fire;
10 a river of fire flowed from his
presence. Thousands upon thousands
served him and myriads upon myriads
were in attendance. The court sat, and
the books were opened.
11 Then because of the bombast the
horn was mouthing, I went on watching
until the beast was killed; its carcass was
destroyed and consigned to the flames.
12 The rest of the beasts, though
deprived of their sovereignty, were
allowed to remain alive until an
appointed time and season.
13 I was still watching in visions of the
night and I saw one like a human being
coming with the clouds of heaven; he
approached the Ancient in Years and was
presented to him.
14 Sovereignty and glory and kingly
power were given to him, so that all
peoples and nations of every language
should serve him; his sovereignty was to
be an everlasting sovereignty which was
not to pass away, and his kingly power
was never to be destroyed.Daniel 7.15–20
37
15 My spirit within me was troubled;
and, dismayed by the visions which
came into my head, I, Daniel,
16 approached one of those who were
standing there and enquired what all this
really signified; and he made known to
me its interpretation.
17 These great beasts, four in number,
he said, are four kingdoms which will
arise from the earth.
18 But the holy ones of the Most High
will receive the kingly power and retain
possession of it always, for ever and
ever.
19 Then I wished to know what the
fourth beast really signified, the beast
that was different from all the others,
exceedingly fearsome with its iron
teeth and bronze claws, devouring and
crunching, then trampling underfoot
what was left.
20 I wished also to know about the ten
horns on its head and about the other
horn which sprang up and at whose
coming three of them fell, the horn which
had eyes and a mouth uttering bombast
and which in its appearance was more
imposing than the others.Daniel 7.21–25
38
21 As I still watched, this horn was
waging war on the holy ones and proving
too strong for them
22 until the Ancient in Years came. Then
judgement was pronounced in favour of
the holy ones of the Most High, and the
time came when the holy ones gained
possession of the kingly power.
23 The explanation he gave was this:
The fourth beast signifies a fourth
kingdom which will appear on earth. It
will differ from the other kingdoms; it
will devour the whole earth, treading it
down and crushing it.
24 The ten horns signify ten kings who
will rise from this kingdom; after them
will arise another king, who will be
different from his predecessors; and he
will bring low three kings.
25 He will hurl defiance at the Most High
and wear down the holy ones of the Most
High. He will have it in mind to alter the
festival seasons and religious laws; and
the holy ones will be delivered into his
power for a time, and times, and half a
time.Daniel 7.26–8.4
39
26 But when the court sits, he will be
deprived of his sovereignty, so that it
may be destroyed and abolished for ever.
27 The kingly power, sovereignty, and
greatness of all the kingdoms under
heaven will be given to the holy people
of the Most High. Their kingly power will
last for ever, and every realm will serve
and obey them.
28 Here the account ends. As for me,
Daniel, my thoughts dismayed me
greatly and I turned pale; but I kept
these things to myself.
1 In the third year of the reign of King
Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me,
Daniel, following my earlier vision.
2 In this vision I was in Susa, the capital
of the province of Elam, watching beside
the Ulai canal.
3 I looked up and saw a ram with two
horns standing by the canal. The two
horns were long, with the longer of the
two coming up after the other.
4 I watched the ram butting towards
the west, the north, and the south. No
beast could stand against it, and from
its power there was no escape. It did as
8Daniel 8.5–9
40
it pleased, and made a great display of
strength.
5 While I pondered this, suddenly a
he-goat came from the west skimming
over the whole earth without touching
the ground; it had a prominent horn
between its eyes.
6 It approached the two-horned ram
which I had seen standing by the canal,
and charged it with impetuous force.
7 I saw it advance on the ram, working
itself into a fury against it. Then it struck
the ram and shattered both its horns;
the ram was powerless to resist. The
he-goat threw it to the ground and
stamped on it, and there was no one to
rescue the ram.
8 The he-goat in turn made a great
display of its strength, but when it was
at the height of its power its great horn
broke, and in place of this there came up
four prominent horns pointing towards
the four quarters of heaven.
9 Out of one of them there emerged a
little horn, which as it grew put forth its
strength towards the south and the east
and towards the fairest of all lands.Daniel 8.10–15
41
10 It aspired to be as great as the host
of heaven, and it flung down to the earth
some of the host, even some of the
stars, and stamped on them.
11 It aspired to be as great as the Prince
of the host, suppressed his regular
offering, and even threw down his
sanctuary.
12 The heavenly host was delivered up,
and the little horn raised itself impiously
against the regular offering and cast true
religion to the ground; it succeeded in all
that it did.
13 I heard a holy one speaking and
another holy one answering. The one
speaker said, How long will the period of
this vision last? How long will the regular
offering be suppressed and impiety
cause desolation? How long will the Holy
Place and the fairest of all lands be given
over to be trodden down?
14 The answer came, For two thousand
three hundred evenings and mornings;
then the Holy Place will be restored.
15 All the while that I, Daniel, was seeing
the vision, I was trying to understand it.
Suddenly I saw standing before me one
with the appearance of a man;Daniel 8.16–23
42
16 at the same time I heard a human
voice calling to him across the bend of
the Ulai, Gabriel, explain the vision to
this man.
17 He came to where I was standing;
and at his approach I prostrated myself
in terror. But he said to me, Understand,
O man: the vision points to the time of
the end.
18 While he spoke to me, I lay face
downwards in a trance, but at his touch
I was made to stand up where I was.
19 I shall make known to you, he said,
what is to happen at the end of the
period of wrath; for there is an end at
the appointed time.
20 The two-horned ram which you saw
signifies the kings of Media and Persia,
21 the he-goat is the king of Greece, the
great horn on its forehead being its first
king.
22 As for the horn which was broken off
and replaced by four other horns: four
kingdoms will rise out of that nation, but
they will lack its power.
23 In the last days of those kingdoms,
when their sin is at its height, a kingDaniel 8.24–9.2
43
of grim aspect will appear, a master of
stratagem.
24 His power will be great, and he will
work havoc untold; he will succeed in
whatever he does. He will work havoc on
the mighty nations and the holy people.
25 By cunning and deceit he will succeed
in his designs; he will devise great
schemes and wreak havoc on many
when they least expect it. He will
challenge even the Prince of princes and
be broken, but by no human hand.
26 This revelation which has been given
of the evenings and the mornings is true;
but you must keep the vision secret, for
it points to days far ahead.
27 As for me, Daniel, my strength failed
and I lay sick for some days. Then I rose
and attended to the king's business. But
I was perplexed by the revelation and no
one could explain it.
1 IN the first year of the reign of
Darius son of Ahasuerus (a Mede by
birth, who was appointed ruler over the
kingdom of the Chaldaeans)
2 I, Daniel, was reading the scriptures
and reflecting on the seventy years
which, according to the word of the
9Daniel 9.3–7
44
LORD to the prophet Jeremiah, were to
pass while Jerusalem lay in ruins.
3 Then I turned to the Lord God in
earnest prayer and supplication with
fasting and with sackcloth and ashes.
4 I prayed and made this confession
to the LORD my God: Lord, great and
terrible God, keeping covenant and faith
with those who love you and observe
your commandments,
5 we have sinned, doing what was
wrong and wicked; we have rebelled and
rejected your commandments and your
decrees.
6 We have turned a deaf ear to your
servants the prophets, who spoke in
your name to our kings and princes, to
our forefathers, and to all the people of
the land.
7 Lord, the right is on your side; the
shame, now as ever, belongs to us,
the people of Judah and the citizens
of Jerusalem, and to all the Israelites
near and far in every land to which you
have banished them for their disloyal
behaviour towards you.Daniel 9.8–13
45
8 LORD, the shame falls on us, on our
kings, our princes, and our forefathers.
We have sinned against you.
9 Compassion and forgiveness belong
to the Lord our God, because we have
rebelled against him.
10 We have not obeyed the LORD our
God, in that we have not conformed
to the laws which he laid down for
our guidance through his servants the
prophets.
11 All Israel has broken your law and
refused to obey your command, so that
the oath and curses recorded in the
law of Moses, the servant of God, have
rained down upon us; for we have sinned
against God.
12 He has made good the warning he
gave about us and our rulers, by bringing
on us and on Jerusalem a disaster
greater than has ever happened in all
the world;
13 and this whole disaster which has
come upon us was foretold in the law
of Moses. Yet we have done nothing to
appease the LORD our God; we have
neither repented of our wrongful deeds,Daniel 9.14–18
46
nor remembered that you are true to
your word.
14 The LORD has kept strict watch and
has now brought the disaster upon us. In
all that he has done the LORD our God
has been just; yet we have not obeyed
him.
15 Now, Lord our God who brought your
people out of Egypt by a strong hand,
winning for yourself a name that lives
on to this day, we have sinned, we have
done wrong.
16 Lord, by all your saving deeds we
beg that your wrath and anger may
depart from Jerusalem, your own city,
your holy hill; on account of our sins and
our fathers crimes, Jerusalem and your
people have become a byword among all
our neighbours.
17 Listen, our God, to your servant's
prayer and supplication; for your own
sake, Lord, look favourably on your
sanctuary which lies desolate.
18 God, incline your ear to us and
hear; open your eyes and look upon our
desolation and upon the city that bears
your name. It is not because of any
righteous deeds of ours, but becauseDaniel 9.19–24
47
of your great mercy that we lay our
supplications before you.
19 Lord, hear; Lord, forgive; Lord, listen
and act; God, for your own sake do not
delay, because your city and your people
bear your name.'
20 I was speaking and praying,
confessing my own sin and the sin of my
people Israel, and laying my supplication
before the LORD my God on behalf of his
holy hill;
21 indeed I was still praying, when the
man Gabriel, whom I had already seen
in the vision, flew close to me at the
hour of the evening offering.
22 He explained to me: Daniel, I
have now come to enlighten your
understanding.
23 As you began your supplications a
decree went forth, and I have come
to make it known, for you are greatly
beloved. Consider well the word,
consider the vision:
24 seventy times seven years are
marked out for your people and your
holy city; then rebellion will be stopped,
sin brought to an end, iniquity expiated,
everlasting right ushered in, vision andDaniel 9.25–10.1
48
prophecy ratified, and the Most Holy
Place anointed.
25 Know, then, and understand: from
the time that the decree went forth
that Jerusalem should be restored and
rebuilt, seven of those seventy will pass
till the appearance of one anointed,
a prince; then for sixty-two it will
remain restored, rebuilt with streets and
conduits. At the critical time,
26 after the sixty-two have passed, the
anointed prince will be removed, and
no one will take his part. The horde of
an invading prince will work havoc on
city and sanctuary. The end of it will be
a cataclysm, inevitable war with all its
horrors.
27 The prince will make a firm league
with the many for one of the seventy;
and, with that one half spent, he will
put a stop to sacrifice and offering. And
in the train of these abominations will
come the perpetrator of desolation;
then, in the end, what has been decreed
concerning the desolation will be poured
out.
1 IN the third year that Cyrus
was king of Persia a revelation
10Daniel 10.2–7
49
came to Daniel, who had been given
the name Belteshazzar. The word was
true, yet only after much struggle did
understanding come to him in the course
of the vision.
2 At that time I, Daniel, mourned for
three whole weeks.
3 I refrained from all choice food; no
meat or wine passed my lips, and I did
not anoint myself until the three weeks
had passed.
4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first
month, I found myself on the bank of
the great river, the Tigris,
5 and when I looked up I saw a man
robed in linen with a belt of Ophir gold
round his waist.
6 His body glowed like topaz, his face
shone like lightning, his eyes flamed like
torches, his arms and feet glittered like
burnished bronze, and when he spoke
his voice sounded like the voice of a
multitude.
7 I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; those
who were near me did not see it, but
such great trepidation fell upon them
that they crept away into hiding.Daniel 10.8–13
50
8 I was left by myself gazing at this
great vision, and my strength drained
away; and sapped of all strength I
became a sorry figure of a man.
9 I heard the sound of his words and, as
I did so, I lay prone on the ground in a
trance.
10 Suddenly, at the touch of a hand, I
was set, all trembling, on my hands and
knees.
11 Daniel, man greatly beloved, he said
to me, attend to the words I am about
to speak to you and stand upright where
you are, for I am now sent to you. When
he spoke to me, I stood up trembling
with apprehension.
12 He went on, Do not be afraid, Daniel,
for from the very first day that you
applied your mind to understanding, and
to mortify yourself before your God, your
prayers have been heard, and I have
come in answer to them.
13 But the guardian angel of the
kingdom of Persia resisted me for
twenty-one days, and then, seeing that I
had held out there, Michael, one of the
chief princes, came to help me against
the prince of the kingdom of Persia.Daniel 10.14–20
51
14 I have come to explain to you what
will happen to your people at the end of
this age; for this too is a vision for those
days.
15 While he spoke in this fashion to me,
I fixed my eyes on the ground and was
unable to speak.
16 Suddenly one with a human
appearance touched my lips; then I
broke my silence and addressed him as
he stood before me: Sir, I said, at this
vision anguish has gripped me, and I am
sapped of all my strength.
17 How can I, my lord's servant,
presume to talk with such as my lord,
since my strength has now failed me and
there is no more spirit left in me?
18 Again the figure touched me and put
strength into me,
19 saying, Do not be afraid, man greatly
beloved; all will be well with you. Take
heart, and be strong. As he spoke, my
strength returned, and I said, Speak, sir,
for you have given me strength.
20 He said, Do you know why I have
come to you? I am first going back to
fight with the prince of Persia, and, asDaniel 10.21–11.5
52
soon as I have left, the prince of Greece
will appear:
21 I have no ally on my side for support
and help, except Michael your prince.
However I shall expound to you
1 what is written in the Book of
Truth;
2 here and now I shall tell you what is
true. Three more kings will appear in
Persia, followed by a fourth who will far
surpass all the others in wealth; and
when by his wealth he has extended his
power, he will mobilize the whole empire
against the kingdom of Greece.
3 Then there will appear a warrior king,
who will rule a vast kingdom and do
whatever he pleases.
4 But once he is established, his
kingdom will be broken up and divided
to the four quarters of heaven. It will
not pass to his descendants; nor will
its power be comparable to his, for his
kingdom will be uprooted and given to
others besides his posterity.
5 The king of the south will become
strong; but one of his generals will
surpass him in strength and win a
greater dominion.
11Daniel 11.6–10
53
6 In the course of time the two will
enter into an alliance, and to seal the
agreement the daughter of the king of
the south will be given in marriage to
the king of the north, but she will not
maintain her influence and their line will
not last. She and those who escorted
her, along with her child, and also her
lord and master, will all be the victims of
foul play.
7 Then another shoot from the same
stock as hers will appear in his father's
place. He will penetrate the defences of
the king of the north, invade his fortress,
and win a decisive victory.
8 He will carry away as booty to Egypt
even the images of their gods cast in
metal and their valuable vessels of silver
and gold. Then for some years he will
refrain from attacking the king of the
north.
9 After that the king of the north will
invade the southern kingdom and then
retire to his own land.
10 His sons will press on with the
assembling of a large force of armed
men. One of them will sweep on like an
irresistible flood. In a second campaignDaniel 11.11–15
54
he will press as far as the enemy
stronghold.
11 The king of the south, working
himself up into a fury, will set out to do
battle with the king of the north. He in
turn will muster a large army, but it will
be delivered into the hands of his enemy.
12 At the capture of this force, the victor
will be elated and will slaughter tens of
thousands; yet he will not maintain his
advantage.
13 The king of the north will once more
raise an army, one even greater than the
last, and after a number of years he will
advance with his huge force and a great
baggage train.
14 During these times many will
resist the king of the south, but some
renegades among your own people will
rashly attempt to give substance to a
vision and will be brought to disaster.
15 The king of the north will then come
and cast up siege-ramps and capture a
well-fortified city. The forces of the south
will not stand up to him; even the flower
of the army will not be able to hold their
ground.Daniel 11.16–20
55
16 The invader will do as he pleases
and meet with no opposition. He will
establish himself in the fairest of all
lands, and it will come wholly into his
power.
17 He will resolve to advance with the
full might of his kingdom; and, when he
has agreed terms with the king of the
south, he will give his young daughter
in marriage to him, with a view to the
destruction of the kingdom; but the
treaty will not last nor will it be his
purpose which is served.
18 Then he will turn to the coasts and
islands and take many prisoners, but a
foreign commander will wear him down
and put an end to his challenge; thus he
will throw his challenge back at him.
19 He will retreat to strongholds in his
own country; there he will meet with
disaster and be overthrown, and he will
be seen no more.
20 His successor will be one who will
send out an officer with a royal escort to
exact tribute; after but a brief time this
king too will meet his end, yet neither
openly nor in battle.Daniel 11.21–25
56
21 His place will be taken by a despicable
creature, one who had not been given
recognition as king; he will come when
he is least expected and seize the
kingdom by smooth dissimulation.
22 As he advances, he will sweep away
all forces of opposition, and even the
Prince of the Covenant will be broken.
23 He will enter into alliances but
dishonour them and, although only a
few people are behind him, he will rise
to power and establish himself
24 against all expectation. He will
overrun the richest districts of the
province, and succeed where all his
ancestors failed, and distribute spoil,
booty, and goods among his followers.
He will frame stratagems against
fortresses, but only for a time.
25 He will rouse himself in all his
strength and courage to lead a great
army against the king of the south,
who will fight back with a very large
and powerful army; yet, hampered by
treachery, the king of the south will not
persist.Daniel 11.26–32
57
26 Those who eat at his board will be his
undoing; his army will be swept away,
and many will fall slain in battle.
27 The two kings, bent on mischief
though seated at the same table, will
lie to each other but with advantage to
neither, for an end is yet to be at the
appointed time.
28 Then the king of the north will return
home with spoils in plenty, and with
hostility in his heart against the Holy
Covenant; he will work his will and
return to his own country.
29 At the appointed time he will once
again invade the south, but he will have
less success than he had before.
30 Ships of Kittim will sail against him,
and he will suffer a rebuff. As he retreats
he will vent his fury against the Holy
Covenant, and on his return home will
single out those who have forsaken it.
31 Soldiers in his command will
desecrate the sanctuary and citadel;
they will abolish the regular offering,
and will set up the abominable thing that
causes desolation.
32 By plausible promises he will win
over those who are ready to violate theDaniel 11.33–37
58
covenant, but the people who are faithful
to their God will be resolute and take
action.
33 Wise leaders of the nation will give
guidance to the people at large, who for
a while will fall victims to sword and fire,
to captivity and pillage.
34 But these victims will have some
help, though only a little, even if many
who join them are insincere.
35 Some of these leaders will themselves
fall victims for a time, so that they may
be tested, refined, and made shining
white; for an end is yet to be at the
appointed time.
36 The king will do as he pleases; he will
exalt and magnify himself above every
god, and against the God of gods he will
utter monstrous blasphemies. Things will
go well for him until the divine wrath is
spent, for what is determined must be
done.
37 Heedless of his ancestral gods and
the god beloved of women, indeed
heedless of all gods, for he will magnify
himself above them all,Daniel 11.38–43
59
38 he will honour the god of fortresses,
a god unknown to his ancestors, with
gold and silver, gems and costly gifts.
39 He will garrison his strongest
fortresses with aliens, the people of a
foreign god. Those whom he favours
he will load with honour, putting them
into authority over the people and
distributing land as a reward.
40 At the time of the end, the king of the
south will make a feint at the king of the
north, but the king of the north will come
storming against him with chariots and
cavalry and a fleet of ships. He will pass
through country after country, sweeping
over them like a flood,
41 among them the fairest of all lands,
and tens of thousands will fall victim;
but these lands, Edom and Moab and the
chief part of the Ammonites, will escape
his clutches.
42 As he gets country after country into
his grasp, not even Egypt will escape;
43 he will seize control of her hidden
stores of gold and silver and of all her
treasures; Libyans and Cushites will
follow in subjection to him.Daniel 11.44–12.4
60
44 Then, alarmed by rumours from east
and north, he will depart in a great rage
to destroy and to exterminate many.
45 He will pitch his royal pavilion
between the sea and the holy hill, the
fairest of all hills; and he will meet his
end with no one to help him.
1 AT that time there will appear
Michael the great captain, who
stands guarding your fellow-countrymen;
and there will be a period of anguish
such as has never been known ever
since they became a nation till that
moment. But at that time your people
will be delivered, everyone whose name
is entered in the book:
2 many of those who sleep in the dust of
the earth will awake, some to everlasting
life and some to the reproach of eternal
abhorrence.
3 The wise leaders will shine like the
bright vault of heaven, and those who
have guided the people in the true path
will be like the stars for ever and ever.
4 But you, Daniel, keep the words secret
and seal the book until the time of the
end. Many will rush to and fro, trying to
gain such knowledge.
12Daniel 12.5–10
61
5 I, Daniel, looked and saw two others
standing, one on this bank of the river
and the other on the farther bank.
6 To the man robed in linen who was
above the waters of the river I said,
How long will it be until the end of these
portents?
7 The man robed in linen who was above
the waters raised his right hand and his
left heavenwards, and I heard him swear
by him who lives for ever: It shall be
for a time and times and half a time.
When the power of the holy people is no
longer being shattered, all these things
will cease.
8 I heard, but I did not understand; so
I said, Sir, what will be the outcome of
these things?
9 He replied, Go your way, Daniel, for
the words are to be kept secret and
sealed till the time of the end.
10 Many will purify themselves and be
refined, making themselves shining
white, but the wicked will continue
in wickedness and none of them will
understand; only the wise leaders will
understand.Daniel 12.11–13
62
11 From the time when the regular
offering is abolished and the abomination
of desolation is set up, one thousand two
hundred and ninety days will elapse.
12 Happy are those who wait and live
to see the completion of one thousand
three hundred and thirty-five days!
13 But you, Daniel, go your way till the
end; you will rest, and then, at the end
of the age, you will arise to your destiny.Hosea
1 THE word of the LORD which came
1 to Hosea son of Beeri during the
reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the
reign of Jeroboam son of Joash king of
Israel.
2 THIS is the beginning of the LORD's
message given by Hosea. He said, Go
and take an unchaste woman as your
wife, and with this woman have children;
for like an unchaste woman this land is
guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD.
3 So he married Gomer daughter of
Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him
a son.
4 The LORD said to Hosea, Call him
Jezreel, for in a little while I am going to
punish the dynasty of Jehu for the blood
shed in the valley of Jezreel, and bring
the kingdom of Israel to an end.
5 On that day I shall break Israel's bow
in the vale of Jezreel.
6 Gomer conceived again and bore a
daughter, and the LORD said to Hosea,Hosea 1.7–2.1
2
Call her Lo-ruhamah; for I shall never
again show love to Israel, never again
forgive them.
7 But Judah I shall love and save. I
shall save them not by bow or sword
or weapon of war, not by horses and
horsemen, but I shall save them by the
LORD their God.
8 After weaning Lo-ruhamah, Gomer
conceived and bore a son;
9 and the LORD said, Call him Lo-ammi;
for you are not my people, and I shall
not be your God.
10 The Israelites will be as countless as
the sands of the sea, which can neither
be measured nor numbered; it will no
longer be said to them, You are not my
people; they will be called Children of
the Living God.
11 The people of Judah and of Israel
will be reunited and will choose for
themselves one leader; they will spring
up from the land, for great will be the
day of Jezreel.
1 You are to say to your brothers, You
are my people, and to your sisters,
You are loved.
2Hosea 2.2–7
3
2 Call your mother to account, for she is
no longer my wife nor am I her husband.
Let her put an end to her infidelity and
banish the lovers from her bosom,
3 or else I shall strip her bare and
parade her naked as the day she was
born. I shall make her bare as the
wilderness, parched as the desert, and
leave her to die of thirst.
4 I shall show no love towards her
children, for they are the offspring of
adultery.
5 Their mother has been promiscuous;
she who conceived them is shameless.
She says, I will go after my lovers, who
supply me with food and drink, with my
wool and flax, my oil and perfumes.
6 That is why I shall close her road with
thorn bushes and obstruct her path with
a wall, so that she can no longer find a
way through.
7 Though she pursues her lovers she will
not overtake them, though she looks for
them she will not find them. At last she
will say, I shall go back to my husband
again, for I was better off then than I am
now.Hosea 2.8–13
4
8 She does not know that it was I who
gave her the grain, the new wine, and
fresh oil, I who lavished on her silver and
gold which they used for the Baal.
9 That is why I am going to take back
my grain at the harvest and my new
wine at the vintage, take away the wool
and the flax which I provided to cover
her naked body.
10 Now I shall reveal her shame to her
lovers, and no one will rescue her from
me.
11 I shall put a stop to all her
merrymaking, her pilgrimages, new
moons, and sabbaths, all her festivals.
12 I shall ravage the vines and the fig
trees, of which she says, These are the
fees which my lovers have paid me, and
I shall leave them to grow wild so that
beasts may eat them.
13 I shall punish her for the holy days
when she burnt sacrifices to the baalim,
when she decked herself with her rings
and necklaces, when, forgetful of me,
she ran after her lovers. This is the word
of the LORD.Hosea 2.14–20
5
14 But now I shall woo her, lead her
into the wilderness, and speak words of
encouragement to her.
15 There I shall restore her vineyards
to her, turning the valley of Achor into a
gate of hope; there she will respond as
in her youth, as when she came up from
Egypt.
16 On that day she will call me My
husband and will no more call me My
Baal; I shall banish from her lips the
very names of the baalim; never again
will their names be invoked. This is the
word of the LORD.
17 (2:16)
18 Then I shall make a covenant on
Israel's behalf with the wild beasts, the
birds of the air, and the creatures that
creep on the ground, and I shall break
bow and sword and weapon of war and
sweep them off the earth, so that my
people may lie down without fear.
19 I shall betroth you to myself for ever,
bestowing righteousness and justice,
loyalty and love;
20 I shall betroth you to myself, making
you faithful, and you will know the LORD.Hosea 2.21–3.4
6
21 At that time I shall answer, says the
LORD; I shall answer the heavens and
they will answer the earth,
22 and the earth will answer the grain,
the new wine, and fresh oil, and they will
answer Jezreel.
23 Israel will be my new sowing in
the land, and I shall show love to
Lo-ruhamah and say to Lo-ammi, You
are my people, and he will say, You are
my God.
1 The LORD said to me, Go again and
bestow your love on a woman loved
by another man, an adulteress; love
her as I, the LORD, love the Israelites,
although they resort to other gods and
love the cakes of raisins offered to idols.
2 So I bought her for fifteen pieces of
silver, a homer of barley, and a measure
of wine;
3 and I said to her, You will live in my
house for a long time and you will not
lead an immoral life. You must have
relations with no one else, indeed not
even with me.
4 So the Israelites will live for a long
time without king or leader, without
3Hosea 3.5–4.6
7
sacrifice or sacred pillar, without ephod
or teraphim.
5 After that they will again seek the
LORD their God and David their king,
and turn with reverence to the LORD and
seek his bounty for the days to come.
1 ISRAEL, hear the word of the LORD;
for the LORD has a charge to bring
against the inhabitants of the land:
There is no good faith or loyalty, no
acknowledgement of God in the land.
2 People swear oaths and break them;
they kill and rob and commit adultery;
there is violence, one deed of blood after
another.
3 Therefore the land will be desolate
and all who live in it will languish, with
the wild beasts and the birds of the air;
even the fish will vanish from the sea.
4 But it is not for mankind to bring
charges, not for them to prove a case;
it is my quarrel, and it is with you, the
priest.
5 By day and by night you blunder on,
you and the prophet with you. Your
nation is brought to ruin;
6 want of knowledge has been the ruin
of my people. As you have rejected
4Hosea 4.7–13
8
knowledge, so will I reject you as a
priest to me. As you have forsaken the
teaching of God, so will I, your God,
forsake your children.
7 The more priests there are, the more
they sin against me; their dignity I shall
turn into dishonour.
8 They feed on the sin of my people and
batten on their iniquity.
9 But people and priest will fare alike. I
shall punish them for their conduct and
repay them for their deeds.
10 They will eat but never be satisfied,
resort to prostitutes and never have
children, for they have abandoned the
LORD
11 to give themselves to immorality.
Wine, old and new, steals my people's
wits;
12 they ask advice from a piece of wood
and accept the guidance of the diviner's
wand; for a spirit of promiscuity has led
them astray and they are unfaithful to
their God.
13 They sacrifice on mountaintops and
burn offerings on the hills, under oak
and poplar and the terebinth's pleasant
shade. That is why your daughters turnHosea 4.14–5.1
9
to prostitution and your sons' brides
commit adultery.
14 I shall not punish your daughters
for becoming prostitutes or your sons'
brides for their adultery, because your
men resort to whores and sacrifice with
temple-prostitutes. A people so devoid
of understanding comes to grief.
15 Israel, though you are adulterous, let
not Judah incur such guilt; let her not
come to Gilgal or go up to Beth-aven to
swear by the life of the LORD.
16 Like a heifer, Israel has turned
stubborn; will the LORD now feed them
like lambs in a broad meadow?
17 Ephraim has associated with idols; a
drunken rabble, they have devoted their
lives to immorality, preferring dishonour
to glory.
18 (4:17)
19 The wind with its wings will carry
them off, and they will find their
sacrifices a delusion.
1 Hear this, you priests, and listen,
Israel; let the royal house mark my
words. Sentence is passed on you, for
you have been a snare at Mizpah, a net
spread out on Tabor,
5Hosea 5.2–10
10
2 and a deep pit at Shittim. I shall
punish them all.
3 I have cared for Ephraim and not
neglected Israel; but now Ephraim has
become promiscuous and Israel has
brought defilement on himself.
4 Their misdeeds have barred the way
back to their God, for the spirit of
immorality which is in them prevents
them from knowing the LORD.
5 Israel's arrogance cries out against
him; Ephraim's guilt is his downfall, and
Judah in turn is brought down.
6 They go with sacrifices of sheep and
cattle to seek the LORD, but do not find
him, for he has withdrawn from them.
7 They have deceived the LORD, for
their children are bastards. Now an
invader is set to devour their fields.
8 Blow the trumpet in Gibeah, the
horn in Ramah, raise the battle cry in
Beth-aven: We are with you, Benjamin!
9 On the day of punishment Ephraim will
be laid waste. This is the certain doom I
have decreed for Israel's tribes.
10 Judah's rulers act like men who move
their neighbour's boundary; on them I
shall pour out my wrath like a flood.Hosea 5.11–6.3
11
11 Ephraim is an oppressor trampling
on justice, obstinately pursuing what is
worthless.
12 But I am going to be a festering sore
to Ephraim, a canker to the house of
Judah.
13 When Ephraim found that he was
sick, and Judah found that he was
covered with sores, Ephraim turned to
Assyria and sent envoys to the Great
King. But he had no power to cure you
or heal your sores.
14 I shall be fierce as a panther to
Ephraim, fierce as a lion to Judah; I shall
maul the prey and go, carry it off beyond
hope of rescue.
15 I shall return to my dwelling-place,
until in remorse they seek me and search
diligently for me in their distress.
1 Come, let us return to the LORD.
He has torn us, but he will heal us,
he has wounded us, but he will bind up
our wounds;
2 after two days he will revive us, on
the third day he will raise us to live in his
presence.
3 Let us strive to know the LORD, whose
coming is as sure as the sunrise. He will
6Hosea 6.4–11
12
come to us like the rain, like spring rains
that water the earth.
4 How shall I deal with you, Ephraim?
How shall I deal with you, Judah? Your
loyalty to me is like the morning mist,
like dew that vanishes early.
5 That is why I have cut them to pieces
by the prophets and slaughtered them
with my words: my judgement goes
forth like light.
6 For I require loyalty, not sacrifice,
acknowledgement of God rather than
whole-offerings.
7 At Admah they violated my covenant,
there they played me false.
8 Gilead is a haunt of evildoers, marked
by a trail of blood.
9 Like marauders lying in wait, priests
are banded together to do murder on
the road to Shechem; their behaviour is
an outrage.
10 At Bethel I have seen a horrible thing:
there Ephraim became promiscuous and
Israel brought defilement on himself.
11 And for you, too, Judah, a harvest of
reckoning will come. When I am minded
to restore the fortunes of my people,Hosea 7.1–7
13
1 when I am minded to heal Israel,
7 the guilt of Ephraim stands revealed,
the wickedness of Samaria. They have
not kept faith; they are thieves breaking
into houses, bandits raiding in the
countryside,
2 unaware that I have their wickedness
ever in mind. Now their misdeeds
encircle them; they are ever before my
eyes.
3 They divert the king with their
wickedness and princes with their
treachery.
4 All of them are adulterers; they are
like an oven fire which the baker does
not have to stir from the kneading of the
dough until it has risen.
5 On their king's festal day the courtiers
become inflamed with wine, and he
himself joins with arrogant men;
6 their hearts are heated like an oven
by their intrigues. During the night their
passion slumbers, but in the morning it
flares up like a blazing fire;
7 they are all as heated as an oven and
devour their rulers. King after king falls
from power, but not one of them calls to
me.Hosea 7.8–15
14
8 Ephraim is mixed up with aliens; he is
like a cake half done.
9 Foreigners feed on his strength, but
he is unaware; grey hairs may come on
him, but he is unaware.
10 Israel's arrogance openly indicts
them; but they do not return to the LORD
their God nor, in spite of everything, do
they seek him.
11 Ephraim is like a silly, senseless
pigeon, now calling to Egypt, now
turning to Assyria for help.
12 Wherever they turn, I shall cast my
net over them and bring them down like
birds; I shall take them captive when I
hear them gathering.
13 Woe betide them, for they have
strayed from me! May disaster befall
them for rebelling against me! I long to
deliver them, but they tell lies about me.
14 There is no sincerity in their cry to
me; for all their wailing on their beds
and gashing of themselves over grain
and new wine, they are turning away
from me.
15 Though I support and strengthen
them, they plot evil against me.Hosea 7.16–8.7
15
16 Like a bow gone slack, they relapse
into useless worship; their leaders will
fall by the sword because of their angry
talk. There will be derision at them in
Egypt.
1 Put the trumpets to your lips! An
eagle circles over the sanctuary
of the LORD; they have violated my
covenant and rebelled against my
instruction.
2 Israel cries to me for help: We
acknowledge you as our God.
3 But Israel rejects what is good, and an
enemy pursues him.
4 They make kings, but not on my
authority; they set up rulers, but without
my knowledge; from their silver and gold
they have made for themselves idols for
their own destruction.
5 Samaria, your calf-god is loathsome!
My anger burns against them! How long
must they remain guilty?
6 The calf was made in Israel; a
craftsman fashioned it and it is no god;
it will be reduced to splinters.
7 Israel sows the wind and reaps the
whirlwind; there are no heads on the
standing grain, it yields no flour; and, if
8Hosea 8.8–9.1
16
it did yield any, strangers would swallow
it up.
8 Israel is swallowed up; now among
the nations they are like a thing of no
value.
9 Like a wild ass that goes its own way,
they have gone up to Assyria. Ephraim
has bargained for lovers;
10 because they have so bargained
among the nations I will now round them
up. Soon they will have to abandon the
setting up of kings and rulers.
11 Ephraim has built altars everywhere
and they have become occasions for sin.
12 Though I give him many written laws,
they are treated as irrelevant;
13 though they sacrifice offerings of
flesh and eat them, the LORD will
not accept them. Their guilt will be
remembered and their sins punished.
Let them go back to Egypt!
14 Israel has forgotten his Maker and
built palaces; Judah has many walled
cities, but I shall burn his cities, and fire
will devour his citadels.
1 Do not rejoice, Israel, or exult like
other peoples; for you have been
unfaithful to your God, you have been
9Hosea 9.2–7
17
attracted by a prostitute's fee on every
threshing-floor heaped with grain.
2 Threshing-floor and winepress will see
them no more, there will be no new wine
for them.
3 They will not dwell in the LORD's land:
Ephraim will go back to Egypt, or eat
unclean food in Assyria.
4 They are not to pour out wine to the
LORD; their sacrifices will not be pleasing
to him; it would be like mourners' fare
for them, and all who ate it would be
polluted. Their food must serve only to
stay their hunger; it must not be offered
in the house of the LORD.
5 What will you do on the festal day, the
day of the LORD's pilgrim-feast?
6 For look, the people have fled from a
scene of devastation: Egypt will receive
them, Memphis will be their grave.
Weeds will engulf their silver treasures,
and thorns their dwellings.
7 The days of punishment have come,
the days of vengeance are here and
Israel knows it. The prophet has become
a fool, the inspired seer a madman,
because of your great guilt and enmity.Hosea 9.8–14
18
8 God appointed the prophet as a
watchman for Ephraim, but he has
become a fowler's trap on all their ways.
There is enmity in the very temple of
God.
9 They are deep in sin as at the time of
Gibeah. Their guilt will be remembered
and their sins punished.
10 I came upon Israel like grapes in
the wilderness; as at the first ripe figs
I looked on their forefathers with joy,
but they resorted to Baal-peor and
consecrated themselves to a thing of
shame. Ephraim became as loathsome
as the thing they loved.
11 Their honour will fly away like a
bird: no childbirth, no fruitful womb, no
conceiving!
12 Even if they rear their children, I will
make them childless, without posterity.
Woe betide them when I turn away from
them!
13 As lions lead out their cubs, just to
be hunted, so must Ephraim bring out
his children for slaughter.
14 Give them whatever you, LORD, are
going to give. Give them wombs that
miscarry and dry breasts.Hosea 9.15–10.4
19
15 All their wickedness at Gilgal aroused
my hatred. I shall drive them from my
house because of their evil deeds, I shall
love them no more, for all their rulers
are in revolt.
16 Ephraim is struck down: their root is
withered, and they yield no fruit; if ever
they give birth, I shall slay the cherished
offspring of their womb.
17 My God will reject them, because
they have not listened to him, and
they will become wanderers among the
nations.
1 ISRAEL is like a spreading vine
with ripening fruit: the more his
fruit, the more his altars; the more
beautiful his land, the more beautiful his
pillars.
2 They are false at heart; now they
must pay the penalty. God himself will
break down their altars and demolish
their sacred pillars.
3 Well may they say, We have no king,
because we do not fear the LORD; and
what could the king do for us?
4 There is nothing but talk; they swear
false oaths and draw up treaties, and
10Hosea 10.5–11
20
litigation spreads like a poisonous weed
along the furrows of the fields.
5 The inhabitants of Samaria tremble
for the calf-god of Beth-aven; the people
mourn over it and its priests lament,
distressed for the image of their god
which is carried away into exile.
6 It will be carried to Assyria as tribute
to the Great King; disgrace will overtake
Ephraim, and Israel, lacking counsel, will
be put to shame.
7 Samaria and her king are swept away
like flotsam on the water;
8 the shrines of Aven are destroyed, the
shrines where Israel sinned; the altars
are overgrown with thorns and thistles.
They will say to the mountains, Cover
us, and to the hills, Fall upon us.
9 Since the time of Gibeah Israel has
sinned; there they took their stand in
rebellion. Will not war overtake them in
Gibeah?
10 I have come against the rebels to
chastise them, and the peoples will mass
against them to chastise them for their
two shameful deeds.
11 Ephraim is like a heifer broken in,
which loves to thresh grain; across thatHosea 10.12–11.2
21
fair neck of hers I have laid a yoke. I
have harnessed Ephraim to the pole to
plough, that Jacob may harrow the land.
12 Sow justice, and reap loyalty. Break
up your fallow ground; it is time to seek
the LORD, till he comes and rains justice
on you.
13 You have ploughed wickedness and
reaped depravity; you have eaten the
fruit of treachery. Because you have
trusted in your chariots, in the number
of your warriors,
14 the tumult of war will arise against
your people, and all your fortresses will
be overthrown as Shalman overthrew
Beth-arbel in the day of battle, dashing
mothers and babes to the ground.
15 So it is to be done to you, Bethel,
because of your great wickedness; as
swiftly as the passing of dawn, the king
of Israel will be swept away.
1 When Israel was a youth, I loved
him; out of Egypt I called my son;
2 but the more I called, the farther
they went from me; they must needs
sacrifice to the baalim and burn offerings
to images.
11Hosea 11.3–9
22
3 It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I
who took them in my arms; but they did
not know that
4 I secured them with reins and led
them with bonds of love, that I lifted
them like a little child to my cheek, that
I bent down to feed them.
5 Back they will go to Egypt, the
Assyrian will be their king; for they have
refused to return to me.
6 The sword will be brandished in their
cities and it will make an end of their
priests and devour them because of their
scheming.
7 My people are bent on rebellion, but
though they call in unison to Baal he will
not lift them up.
8 How can I hand you over, Ephraim,
how can I surrender you, Israel? How
can I make you like Admah or treat you
as Zeboyim? A change of heart moves
me, tenderness kindles within me.
9 I am not going to let loose my fury, I
shall not turn and destroy Ephraim, for
I am God, not a mortal; I am the Holy
One in your midst. I shall not come with
threats.Hosea 11.10–12.4
23
10 They will follow the LORD who roars
like a lion, and when he roars, his sons
will speed out of the west.
11 They will come speedily like birds out
of Egypt, like pigeons from Assyria, and
I shall settle them in their own homes.
This is the word of the LORD.
12 The treachery of Ephraim
encompasses me, as does the
deceit of the house of Israel; and Judah
is still restive under God, still loyal to the
idols he counts holy.
1 Ephraim feeds on wind, he
pursues the east wind all day, he
piles up treachery and havoc; he makes
a treaty with Assyria and carries tribute
of oil to Egypt.
2 The LORD has a charge to bring
against Judah and is resolved to punish
Jacob for his conduct; he will requite him
for his misdeeds.
3 Even in the womb Jacob supplanted
his brother, and in manhood he strove
with God.
4 He strove with the angel and
prevailed; he wept and entreated his
favour. God met him at Bethel and spoke
with him there.
12Hosea 12.5–13
24
5 The LORD the God of Hosts, the LORD
is his name!
6 Turn back by God's help; maintain
loyalty and justice and wait continually
for your God.
7 False scales are in merchants' hands,
and they love to cheat.
8 Ephraim says, Surely I have become
rich, I have made my fortune, but
despite all my gains the guilt of sin will
not be found in me.
9 Yet I have been the LORD your God
since your days in Egypt; I shall make
you live in tents yet again, as in the days
of the Tent of Meeting.
10 I spoke to the prophets; it was I who
gave vision after vision: I declared my
mind through them.
11 In Gilead there was idolatry, the
people were worthless and sacrificed to
bull-gods in Gilgal; their altars were like
heaps of stones beside a ploughed field.
12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram; Israel
did service to win a wife, to win her he
tended sheep.
13 By a prophet the LORD brought Israel
up from Egypt and by a prophet Israel
was tended.Hosea 12.14–13.6
25
14 Ephraim gave bitter provocation; he
will be left to suffer for the blood he has
shed; his Lord will punish him for all his
blasphemy.
1 Ephraim was a prince and a
leader and he was exalted in
Israel, but, guilty of Baal-worship, he
suffered death.
2 Yet now they sin more and more; they
cast for themselves images, they use
their silver to make idols, all fashioned
by craftsmen. It is said of Ephraim:
They offer human sacrifice and kiss
calf-images.
3 Therefore they will be like the morning
mist, like dew that vanishes early, like
chaff blown from the threshing-floor or
smoke from a chimney.
4 But since your days in Egypt I have
been the LORD your God; you do not
know any god but me, any saviour other
than me.
5 I cared for you in the wilderness, in a
land of burning heat.
6 They were fed and satisfied, and, once
satisfied, they grew proud, and so they
deserted me.
13Hosea 13.7–14
26
7 Now I shall be like a panther to them, I
shall prowl like a leopard by the wayside;
8 I shall come on them like a she-bear
robbed of her cubs and tear their ribs
apart, like a lioness I shall devour them
on the spot, like a wild beast I shall rip
them up.
9 I have destroyed you, Israel; who is
there to help you?
10 Where now is your king that he may
save you, in all your cities where are
your rulers? Give me a king and princes,
you said.
11 I gave you a king in my anger, and in
my wrath I took him away.
12 Ephraim's guilt is tied up in a scroll,
his sins are kept on record.
13 When the pangs of his birth came
over his mother, he showed himself a
senseless child; for at the proper time he
could not present himself at the mouth
of the womb.
14 Shall I deliver him from the grave?
Shall I redeem him from death? Where
are your plagues, death? Grave, where
is your sting? I shall put compassion out
of my sight.Hosea 13.15–14.4
27
15 Though he flourishes among his
brothers, an east wind will come, a blast
from the LORD rising over the desert,
causing springs to fail and fountains
to run dry. The enemy will plunder his
wealth, all his costly treasures.
16 Samaria will become desolate
because she has rebelled against her
God; her babes will fall by the sword and
be dashed to the ground, and pregnant
women will be ripped up.
1 RETURN, Israel, to the LORD
your God; for your iniquity has
been your downfall.
2 Come back to the LORD with your
words of confession; say to him, You will
surely take away iniquity. Accept our
wealth; we shall pay our vows with cattle
from our pens.
3 Assyria will not save us, nor shall we
rely on horses; what we have made with
our own hands we shall never again
call gods; for in you the fatherless find
compassion.
4 I shall heal my people's apostasy; I
shall love them freely, for my anger is
turned away from them.
14Hosea 14.5–9
28
5 I shall be as dew to Israel that they
may flower like the lily, strike root like
the poplar,
6 and put out fresh shoots, that they
may be as fair as the olive and fragrant
as Lebanon.
7 Israel will again dwell in my shadow;
they will grow vigorously like grain, they
will flourish like a vine, and be as famous
as the wine of Lebanon.
8 What further dealings has Ephraim
with idols? I declare it and affirm it: I
am the pine tree that shelters you; your
prosperity comes from me.
9 Let the wise consider these things
and let the prudent acknowledge them:
the LORD's ways are straight and the
righteous walk in them, while sinners
stumble.Joel
1 THE word of the LORD which came
1 to Joel son of Pethuel.
2 HEAR this, you elders; listen to me, all
you inhabitants of the land! Has the like
of this happened in your days or in the
days of your forefathers?
3 Tell it to your children and let them tell
it to theirs; let one generation pass it on
to another.
4 What the locust has left, the swarmer
devours; what the swarmer has left, the
hopper devours; and what the hopper
has left, the grub devours.
5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
Mourn for the new wine, all you
wine-drinkers, for it is denied to you.
6 A horde, vast and past counting, has
invaded my land; they have teeth like
a lion's teeth; they have the fangs of a
lioness.
7 They have laid waste my vines and left
my fig trees broken; they have plucked
them bare and stripped them of their
bark, leaving the branches white.Joel 1.8–14
2
8 Wail like a virgin in sackcloth, wailing
over the betrothed of her youth:
9 the grain-offering and drink-offering
are cut off from the house of the LORD.
Mourn, you priests, who minister to the
LORD!
10 The fields are ruined, the ground
mourns; for the grain is ruined, the new
wine has come to naught, the oil has
failed.
11 Despair, you farmers, and lament,
you vine-dressers, over the wheat and
the barley; the harvest of the fields is
lost.
12 The vines have come to naught, and
the fig trees have failed; pomegranate,
palm, and apple, every tree of the
countryside is dried up, and all the
people's joy has come to an end.
13 Put on sackcloth, you priests, and
mourn; lament, you ministers of the
altar; come, lie in sackcloth all night
long, you ministers of my God; for
grain-offerings and drink-offerings are
withheld from the house of your God.
14 Appoint a solemn fast, proclaim a day
of abstinence. You elders, gather all whoJoel 1.15–2.1
3
live in the land to the house of the LORD
your God, and cry out to him:
15 The day is near, the day of the LORD:
it comes as a mighty destruction from
the Almighty.
16 It is already before our eyes: food is
cut off from the house of our God and
there is neither joy nor gladness.
17 Under the clods the seeds have
shrivelled, the water-channels are dry,
the barns lie in ruins; for the harvests
have come to naught.
18 How the cattle moan! The herds of
oxen are distraught because they have
no pasture; even the flocks of sheep
waste away.
19 To you, LORD, I cry out; for fire
has consumed the open pastures,
flames have burnt up every tree in the
countryside.
20 Even the beasts in the field look to
you; for the streams are dried up, and
fire has consumed the open pastures.
1 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sound the
alarm on my holy mountain! Let all
the inhabitants of the land tremble, for
the day of the LORD is coming, a day of
darkness and gloom is at hand, a day
2Joel 2.2–9
4
of cloud and dense fog. Like blackness
spread over the mountains a vast and
countless host appears; their like has
never been known, nor will be in all the
ages to come.
2 (2:1)
3 Their vanguard is a devouring fire,
their rearguard a leaping flame; before
them the land is a garden of Eden, but
behind them it is a desolate waste;
nothing survives their passing.
4 In appearance like horses, like cavalry
they charge;
5 they bound over the peaks with a
din like chariots, like crackling flames
burning up stubble, like a vast host in
battle array.
6 Nations tremble at their onset, every
face is drained of colour.
7 Like warriors they charge, like soldiers
they scale the walls; each keeps in line
with no confusion in the ranks,
8 none jostling his neighbour; each
keeps to his course. Weapons cannot
halt their attack;
9 they burst into the city, race along the
wall, climb into the houses, entering like
thieves through the windows.Joel 2.10–16
5
10 At their onset the earth shakes, the
heavens shudder, sun and moon are
darkened, and the stars withhold their
light.
11 The LORD thunders as he leads his
host; his is a mighty army, countless are
those who do his bidding. Great is the
day of the LORD and most terrible; who
can endure it?
12 Yet even now, says the LORD, turn
back to me wholeheartedly with fasting,
weeping, and mourning.
13 Rend your hearts and not your
garments, and turn back to the LORD
your God, for he is gracious and
compassionate, long-suffering and ever
constant, ready always to relent when
he threatens disaster.
14 It may be he will turn back and
relent and leave a blessing behind him,
blessing enough for grain-offerings and
drink-offerings to be presented to the
LORD your God.
15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, appoint
a solemn fast, proclaim a day of
abstinence.
16 Gather the people together, appoint
a solemn assembly; summon the elders,Joel 2.17–21
6
gather the children, even babes at the
breast; bid the bridegroom leave his
wedding-chamber and the bride her
bower.
17 Let the priests, the ministers of the
LORD, stand weeping between the porch
and the altar and say, Spare your people,
LORD; do not expose your own people
to insult, to be made a byword by other
nations. Why should the peoples say,
Where is their God?
18 THEN the LORD showed his ardent
love for his land, and was moved with
compassion for his people.
19 He answered their appeal and said: I
shall send you corn, new wine, and oil,
and you will have them in plenty. I shall
expose you no longer to the reproach of
other nations.
20 I shall remove the northern peril far
from you and banish it into a land arid
and waste, the vanguard into the eastern
sea, the rearguard into the western sea;
the stench and foul smell of it will go up.
He has done great things!
21 Earth, fear not, but rejoice and be
glad; for the LORD has done great
things.Joel 2.22–28
7
22 Fear not, you beasts in the field; for
the open pastures will be green, the
trees will bear fruit, the fig and the vine
yield their harvest.
23 People of Zion, rejoice, be glad in the
LORD your God, who gives you food in
due measure by sending you rain, the
autumn and spring rains as of old.
24 The threshing-floors will be heaped
with grain, the vats will overflow with
new wine and oil.
25 I shall recompense you for the years
that the swarmer has eaten, hopper and
grub and locust, my great army which I
sent against you.
26 You will eat until you are satisfied,
and praise the name of the LORD your
God who has done wonderful things for
you, and my people will never again be
put to shame.
27 You will know that I am present in
Israel, that I and no other am the LORD
your God; and my people will never
again be put to shame.
28 After this I shall pour out my spirit on
all mankind; your sons and daughters
will prophesy, your old men will dream
dreams and your young men see visions;Joel 2.29–3.4
8
29 I shall pour out my spirit in those
days even on slaves and slave-girls.
30 I shall set portents in the sky and
on earth, blood and fire and columns of
smoke.
31 The sun will be turned to darkness
and the moon to blood before the coming
of the great and terrible day of the LORD.
32 Then everyone who invokes the
LORD's name will be saved: on Mount
Zion and in Jerusalem there will be a
remnant as the LORD has promised,
survivors whom the LORD calls.
1 When that time comes, on that day
when I reverse the fortunes of Judah
and Jerusalem,
2 I shall gather all the nations together
and lead them down to the valley of
Jehoshaphat. There I shall bring them
to judgement on behalf of Israel, my
own people, whom they have scattered
among the nations; they have shared
out my land
3 and divided my people by lot,
bartering a boy for a whore and selling a
girl for a drink of wine.
4 What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon
and all the districts of Philistia? Are you
3Joel 3.5–10
9
bent on taking vengeance on me? If you
were to take vengeance, I should make
your deeds recoil swiftly and speedily on
your own heads.
5 You have taken my silver and gold and
carried off my costly treasures to your
temples;
6 you have sold the people of Judah and
Jerusalem to the Greeks, and removed
them far beyond their own frontiers.
7 But I shall rouse them to leave the
places to which they have been sold. I
shall make your deeds recoil on your
own heads,
8 by selling your sons and your
daughters to the people of Judah, who
will then sell them to the Sabaeans, a
distant nation. Those are the LORD's
words.
9 Proclaim this amongst the nations:
Declare war, call your troops to arms!
Let all the fighting men advance to the
attack.
10 Beat your mattocks into swords and
your pruning-knives into spears. Let
even the weakling say, I am strong.Joel 3.11–17

11 Muster, all you nations round about;
let them gather together there. LORD,
send down your champions!
12 Let the nations hear the call to
arms and march up to the valley
of Jehoshaphat. There I shall sit in
judgement on all the nations round
about.
13 Wield the knife, for the harvest is
ripe; come, tread the grapes, for the
winepress is full; empty the vats, for
they are full to the brim.
14 A noisy throng in the valley of
Decision! The day of the LORD is at hand
in the valley of Decision:
15 sun and moon are darkened and the
stars withhold their light.
16 The LORD roars from Zion and
thunders from Jerusalem so that heaven
and earth shudder; but the LORD is
a refuge for his people, a defence for
Israel.
17 Thus you will know that I am the
LORD your God, dwelling in Zion, my
holy mountain; Jerusalem will be holy,
and foreigners will never again set foot
in it.Joel 3.18–21
11
18 When that day comes, the mountains
will run with the new wine and the hills
flow with milk. Every channel in Judah
will be full of water; a fountain will spring
from the LORD's house and water the
wadi of Shittim.
19 Egypt will become a desolation and
Edom a desolate waste, because of the
violence done to Judah and the innocent
blood shed in her land.
20 But Judah will be inhabited for
ever, Jerusalem for generation after
generation.
21 I shall avenge their blood, the blood I
have not yet avenged, and the LORD will
dwell in Zion.Amos
1 THE words of Amos, one of the
1 sheep-farmers of Tekoa. He received
these words in visions about Israel
during the reigns of Uzziah king of Judah
and Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of
Israel, two years before the earthquake.
2 He said, The LORD roars from Zion
and thunders from Jerusalem; the
shepherds' pastures are dried up and the
choicest farmland is parched.
3 THESE are the words of the LORD: For
crime after crime of Damascus I shall
grant them no reprieve, because they
threshed Gilead under threshing-sledges
spiked with basalt.
4 Therefore I shall send fire on Hazael's
house, fire to consume Ben-hadad's
palaces;
5 I shall crush the nobles of Damascus
and wipe out those who live in the
vale of Aven and the sceptred ruler of
Beth-eden; the people of Aram will be
carried to exile in Kir. It is the word of
the LORD.Amos 1.6–11
2
6 These are the words of the LORD:
For crime after crime of Gaza I shall
grant them no reprieve, because they
deported a whole community into exile
and delivered them to Edom.
7 Therefore I shall send fire on the walls
of Gaza, fire to consume its palaces.
8 I shall wipe out those who live
in Ashdod and the sceptred ruler of
Ashkelon; I shall turn my hand against
Ekron, and the Philistines who are left
will perish. It is the word of the Lord
GOD.
9 These are the words of the LORD: For
crime after crime of Tyre I shall grant
them no reprieve, because, ignoring the
brotherly alliance, they handed over a
whole community to exile in Edom.
10 Therefore I shall send fire on the
walls of Tyre, fire to consume its palaces.
11 These are the words of the LORD: For
crime after crime of Edom I shall grant
them no reprieve, because, sword in
hand and stifling their natural affections,
they hunted down their kinsmen. Their
anger raged unceasingly, their fury
stormed unchecked.Amos 1.12–2.3
3
12 Therefore I shall send fire on Teman,
fire to consume the palaces of Bozrah.
13 These are the words of the LORD:
For crime after crime of the Ammonites I
shall grant them no reprieve, because in
their greed for land they ripped open the
pregnant women in Gilead.
14 Therefore I shall set fire to the walls
of Rabbah, fire to consume its palaces
amid war cries on the day of battle,
with a whirlwind on the day of sweeping
tempest;
15 then their king will go into exile, he
and his officers with him. It is the word
of the LORD.
1 These are the words of the LORD:
For crime after crime of Moab I shall
grant them no reprieve, because they
burnt to lime the bones of the king of
Edom.
2 Therefore I shall send fire on Moab,
fire to consume the palaces of Kerioth;
Moab will perish in uproar, amid war
cries and the sound of trumpets,
3 and I shall make away with its ruler
and with him slay all the officers. It is
the word of the LORD.
2Amos 2.4–10
4
4 These are the words of the LORD: For
crime after crime of Judah I shall grant
them no reprieve, because they have
spurned the law of the LORD and have
not observed his decrees; they have
been led astray by the same false gods
their fathers followed.
5 Therefore I shall send fire on Judah,
fire to consume the palaces of Jerusalem.
6 These are the words of the LORD: For
crime after crime of Israel I shall grant
them no reprieve, because they sell
honest folk for silver and the poor for a
pair of sandals.
7 They grind the heads of the helpless
into the dust and push the humble out of
their way. Father and son resort to the
temple girls, so profaning my holy name.
8 Men lie down beside every altar on
garments held in pledge, and in the
house of their God they drink wine on
the proceeds of fines.
9 It was I who destroyed the Amorite
before them; he was as tall as the
cedars, as sturdy as the oak; I destroyed
his fruit above and his root below.
10 It was I who brought you up out of
Egypt, and for forty years led you in theAmos 2.11–3.2
5
wilderness, to take possession of the
country of the Amorite;
11 I raised up prophets from among
your sons, Nazirites from among your
young men. Israelites, is this not true?
says the LORD.
12 But you have made the Nazirites
drink wine, and said to the prophets, You
are not to prophesy.
13 Listen, I groan under the burden of
you, as a wagon creaks under a full load.
14 Flight will be cut off for the swift,
the strong will not recover strength. The
warrior will not save himself,
15 the archer will not stand his ground;
the swift of foot will not escape, nor the
horseman save himself.
16 On that day the bravest of warriors
will throw away his weapons and flee. It
is the word of the LORD.
1 LISTEN, Israelites, to these words
that the LORD addresses to you, to
the whole nation which he brought up
from Egypt:
2 You alone I have cared for among all
the nations of the world; that is why I
shall punish you for all your wrongdoing.
3Amos 3.3–10
6
3 Do two people travel together unless
they have so agreed?
4 Does a lion roar in the thicket if he has
no prey? Does a young lion growl in his
den unless he has caught something?
5 Does a bird fall into a trap on the
ground if no bait is set for it? Does a
trap spring from the ground and take
nothing?
6 If a trumpet sounds in the city, are not
the people alarmed? If disaster strikes a
city, is it not the work of the LORD?
7 Indeed, the Lord GOD does nothing
without revealing his plan to his servants
the prophets.
8 The lion has roared; who is not
frightened? The Lord GOD has spoken;
who will not prophesy?
9 Upon the palaces of Ashdod and
upon the palaces of Egypt, make this
proclamation: Assemble on the hills of
Samaria, look at the tumult seething
among her people, at the oppression in
her midst;
10 what do they care for straight dealing
who hoard in their palaces the gains
of violence and plundering? This is the
word of the LORD.Amos 3.11–4.1
7
11 Therefore these are the words of the
Lord GOD: An enemy will encompass
the land; your stronghold will be thrown
down and your palaces sacked.
12 These are the words of the LORD:
As a shepherd rescues from the jaws
of a lion a pair of shin-bones or the
tip of an ear, so will the Israelites who
live in Samaria be rescued, who repose
on the finest beds and on divans from
Damascus.
13 Listen and testify against the
descendants of Jacob. This is the word of
the Lord GOD, the God of Hosts.
14 On the day when I deal with Israel for
their crimes, I shall deal with the altars
of Bethel: the horns of the altar will be
hacked off and fall to the ground.
15 I shall break down both winter houses
and summer residences; the houses
adorned with ivory will perish, and great
houses will be no more. This is the word
of the LORD.
1 Listen to this word, you Bashan
cows on the hill of Samaria, who
oppress the helpless and grind down the
poor, who say to your lords, Bring us
drink:
4Amos 4.2–7
8
2 the Lord GOD has sworn by his
holiness that your time is coming when
men will carry you away on shields and
your children in fish-baskets.
3 You will each be carried straight out
through the breaches in the wall and
thrown on a dunghill. This is the word of
the LORD.
4 Come to Bethel -- and infringe my
law! Come to Gilgal -- and infringe it
yet more! Bring your sacrifices for the
morning, your tithes within three days.
5 Burn your thank-offering without
leaven; announce publicly your freewill-
offerings; for that is what you Israelites
love to do! This is the word of the Lord
GOD.
6 It was I who brought starvation to all
your towns, who spread famine through
all your settlements; yet you did not
come back to me. This is the word of the
LORD.
7 It was I who withheld the heavy
showers from you while there were still
three months to the harvest. I would
send rain on one town and no rain on
another; rain would fall on one field,
another would be parched for lack of it.Amos 4.8–13
9
8 From this town and that, people would
stagger to another for water to drink,
but would not find enough; yet you did
not come back to me. This is the word of
the LORD.
9 I struck you with black blight and red;
I dried up your gardens and vineyards;
the locust devoured your fig trees and
your olives; yet you did not come back
to me. This is the word of the LORD.
10 I sent plague among you like the
plagues of Egypt; with the sword I slew
your young men and your troops of
horses. I made your camps stink in your
nostrils; yet you did not come back to
me. This is the word of the LORD.
11 I brought destruction among you
like the terrible destruction that befell
Sodom and Gomorrah; you were like a
brand snatched from the burning; yet
you did not come back to me. This is the
word of the LORD.
12 Therefore, Israel, this is what I shall
do to you; and, because this is what I
shall do, Israel, prepare to meet your
God.
13 It is he who fashions the mountains,
who creates the wind, and declaresAmos 5.1–6
10
his thoughts to mankind; it is he who
darkens the dawn with thick clouds and
marches over the heights of the earth --
his name is the LORD, the God of Hosts.
1 Listen, Israel, to these words, the
dirge I raise over you:
2 She has fallen, to rise no more, the
virgin Israel, prostrate on her own soil,
with no one to lift her up.
3 These are the words of the Lord GOD:
The city that marched out to war a
thousand strong will have but a hundred
left, and that which marched out a
hundred strong will have but ten left for
Israel.
4 These are the words of the LORD to
the people of Israel: If you would live,
make your way to me,
5 not to Bethel; do not go to Gilgal or
pass on to Beersheba; for Gilgal will
surely go into exile and Bethel come to
nothing.
6 If you would live, make your way to
the LORD, or he will break out against
Joseph's descendants like fire, fire which
will devour Bethel with no one to quench
it.
5Amos 5.7–13
11
7 You that turn justice to poison and
thrust righteousness to the ground,
8 He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
who turns deep darkness into dawn and
darkens day into night, who summons
the waters of the sea and pours them
over the earth -- the LORD is his name --
9 who makes destruction flash forth
against the mighty so that destruction
comes upon the stronghold.
10 you that hate a man who brings the
wrongdoer to court and abominate him
who speaks nothing less than truth:
11 for all this, because you levy taxes
on the poor and extort a tribute of
grain from them, though you have built
houses of hewn stone, you will not live in
them; though you have planted pleasant
vineyards, you will not drink wine from
them.
12 For I know how many are your
crimes, how monstrous your sins: you
bully the innocent, extort ransoms, and
in court push the destitute out of the
way.
13 In such a time, therefore, it is
prudent to stay quiet, for it is an evil
time.Amos 5.14–19
12
14 Seek good, and not evil, that you
may live, that the LORD, the God of
Hosts, may be with you, as you claim he
is.
15 Hate evil, and love good; establish
justice in the courts; it may be that the
LORD, the God of Hosts, will show favour
to the survivors of Joseph.
16 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD, the God of Hosts. In all the public
squares, there will be wailing, the sound
of grief in every street. The farmer
will be called to mourning, and wailing
proclaimed to those skilled in the dirge;
17 there will be wailing in every
vineyard; for I shall pass through your
midst, says the LORD.
18 Woe betide those who long for the
day of the LORD! What will the day of the
LORD mean for you? It will be darkness,
not light;
19 it will be as when someone runs from
a lion, only to be confronted by a bear,
or as when he enters his house and
leans with his hand on the wall, only to
be bitten by a snake.Amos 5.20–6.1
13
20 The day of the LORD is indeed
darkness, not light, a day of gloom
without a ray of brightness.
21 I spurn with loathing your pilgrim-
feasts; I take no pleasure in your sacred
ceremonies.
22 When you bring me your whole-
offerings and your grain-offerings I shall
not accept them, nor pay heed to your
shared-offerings of stall-fed beasts.
23 Spare me the sound of your songs; I
shall not listen to the strumming of your
lutes.
24 Instead let justice flow on like a river
and righteousness like a never-failing
torrent.
25 Did you, people of Israel, bring me
sacrifices and offerings those forty years
in the wilderness?
26 No! But now you will take up the
shrine of your idol-king and the pedestals
of your images, which you have made
for yourselves,
27 and I shall drive you into exile beyond
Damascus. So says the LORD; the God
of Hosts is his name.
1 Woe betide those living at ease in
Zion, and those complacent on the
6Amos 6.2–9
14
hill of Samaria, men of mark in the first
of nations, those to whom the people of
Israel have recourse!
2 Go over and look at Calneh, travel
on to great Hamath, then go down to
Gath of the Philistines -- are they better
than these kingdoms, or is their territory
greater than yours?
3 You thrust aside all thought of the evil
day and hasten the reign of violence.
4 You loll on beds inlaid with ivory and
lounge on your couches; you feast on
lambs from the flock and stall-fed calves;
5 you improvise on the lute and like
David invent musical instruments,
6 you drink wine by the bowlful and
anoint yourselves with the richest of
oils; but at the ruin of Joseph you feel no
grief.
7 Now, therefore, you will head the
column of exiles; lounging and laughter
will be at an end.
8 The Lord GOD has sworn by himself:
I abhor the arrogance of Jacob, I detest
his palaces; I shall abandon the city and
its people to their fate.
9 If ten are left in one house, they will
die.Amos 6.10–7.1
15
10 If a relative and an embalmer take
up a body to carry it out of the house
for burial, they will call to someone in
a corner of the house, Any more there?
and he will answer, No; then he will add,
Hush! -- for the name of the LORD must
not be mentioned.
11 When the LORD commands, great
houses will be reduced to rubble and the
small houses shattered.
12 Can horses gallop over rocks? Can
the sea be ploughed with oxen? Yet you
have turned into venom the process of
law, justice itself you have turned into
poison.
13 Jubilant over a nothing, you boast,
Have we not won power by our own
strength?
14 Israel, I am raising a nation against
you, and they will harry your land from
Lebo-hamath to the wadi of the Arabah.
This is the word of the LORD the God of
Hosts.
1 THIS was what the Lord GOD
showed me: it was a swarm of
locusts hatching when the later corn,
which comes after the king's early crop,
was beginning to sprout.
7Amos 7.2–9
16
2 As they devoured every trace of
vegetation in the land, I said, Lord GOD,
forgive, I pray you. How can Jacob
survive? He is so small.
3 The LORD relented. This will not
happen, he said.
4 This was what the Lord GOD showed
me: the Lord GOD was summoning a
flame of fire to devour the great abyss,
and to devour the land.
5 I said, Lord GOD, cease, I pray you.
How can Jacob survive? He is so small.
6 The LORD relented. This also will not
happen, he said.
7 This was what the Lord showed me:
there he was standing by a wall built
with the aid of a plumb-line, and he had
a plumb-line in his hand.
8 The LORD asked me, What do you see,
Amos? A plumb-line, I answered. Then
the LORD said, I am setting a plumb-line
in the midst of my people Israel; never
again shall I pardon them.
9 The shrines of Isaac will be desolated
and the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste;
and sword in hand I shall rise against
the house of Jeroboam.Amos 7.10–16
17
10 AMAZIAH, the priest of Bethel,
reported to King Jeroboam of Israel:
Amos has conspired against you here in
the heart of Israel; the country cannot
tolerate all his words.
11 This is what he is saying: Jeroboam
will die by the sword, and the Israelites
will assuredly be deported from their
native land.
12 To Amos himself Amaziah said, Seer,
go away! Off with you to Judah! Earn
your living and do your prophesying
there.
13 But never prophesy again at Bethel,
for this is the king's sanctuary, a royal
shrine.
14 I was no prophet, Amos replied to
Amaziah, nor was I a prophet's son; I
was a herdsman and fig-grower.
15 But the LORD took me as I followed
the flock and it was the LORD who said
to me, Go and prophesy to my people
Israel.
16 So now listen to the word of the
LORD. You tell me I am not to prophesy
against Israel or speak out against the
people of Isaac.Amos 7.17–8.5
18
17 Now these are the words of the
LORD: Your wife will become a prostitute
in the city, and your sons and daughters
will fall by the sword. Your land will be
parcelled out with a measuring line, you
yourself will die in a heathen country,
and Israel will be deported from their
native land.
1 THIS was what the Lord GOD
showed me: it was a basket of
summer fruit.
2 What is that you are looking at, Amos?
he said. I answered, A basket of ripe
summer fruit. Then the LORD said to me,
The time is ripe for my people Israel.
Never again shall I pardon them.
3 On that day, says the Lord GOD,
the palace songs will give way to
lamentation: So many corpses, flung out
everywhere! Silence!
4 Listen to this, you that grind the poor
and suppress the humble in the land
5 while you say, When will the new
moon be over so that we may sell grain?
When will the sabbath be past so that we
may expose our wheat for sale, giving
short measure in the bushel and taking
8Amos 8.6–11
19
overweight in the silver, tilting the scales
fraudulently,
6 and selling the refuse of the wheat;
that we may buy the weak for silver and
the poor for a pair of sandals?
7 The LORD has sworn by the arrogance
of Jacob: I shall never forget any of
those activities of theirs.
8 Will not the earth quake on account of
this? Will not all who live on it mourn?
The whole earth will surge and seethe
like the Nile and subside like the river of
Egypt.
9 On that day, says the Lord GOD, I
shall make the sun go down at noon and
darken the earth in broad daylight.
10 I shall turn your pilgrim-feasts
into mourning and all your songs into
lamentation. I shall make you all put
sackcloth round your waists and have
everyone's head shaved. I shall make it
like mourning for an only son and the
end of it like a bitter day.
11 The time is coming, says the Lord
GOD, when I shall send famine on the
land, not hunger for bread or thirst for
water, but for hearing the word of the
LORD.Amos 8.12–9.3
20
12 People will stagger from sea to sea,
they will range from north to east, in
search of the word of the LORD, but they
will not find it.
13 On that day fair maidens and young
men will faint from thirst;
14 all who take their oath by Ashimah,
goddess of Samaria, all who swear, As
your god lives, Dan, and, By the sacred
way to Beersheba, they all will fall to rise
no more.
1 I saw the Lord standing by the altar,
and he said: Strike the capitals so
that the whole porch is shaken; smash
them down on the heads of the people,
and those who are left I shall put to
the sword. No fugitive will escape, no
survivor find safety.
2 Though they dig down to Sheol, from
there my hand will take them; though
they climb up to the heavens, from there
I shall bring them down.
3 If they hide on the summit of Carmel,
there I shall hunt them out and take
them; if they conceal themselves from
my sight in the depths of the sea, there
at my command the sea serpent will bite
them.
9Amos 9.4–9
21
4 If they are herded off into captivity by
their enemies, there I shall command
the sword to slay them; I shall fix my
eye on them for evil, and not for good.
5 The LORD the God of Hosts -- at his
touch the earth heaves, and all who
live on it mourn, while the whole earth
surges like the Nile and subsides like the
river of Egypt;
6 he builds his upper chambers in the
heavens and arches the vault of the sky
over the earth; he summons the waters
of the sea and pours them over the earth
-- his name is the LORD.
7 Are not you Israelites like the Cushites
to me? says the LORD. Did I not bring
Israel up from Egypt, and the Philistines
from Caphtor, the Aramaeans from Kir?
8 Behold, I, the Lord GOD, have my
eyes on this sinful kingdom, and I shall
destroy it from the face of the earth.
YET I shall not totally destroy Jacob's
posterity, says the LORD.
9 No; I shall give the command, and
shake Israel among all the nations, as a
sieve is shaken to and fro without one
pebble falling to the ground.Amos 9.10–15
22
10 They will die by the sword, all the
sinners of my people, who say, You will
not let disaster approach or overtake us.
11 On that day I shall restore David's
fallen house; I shall repair its gaping
walls and restore its ruins; I shall rebuild
it as it was long ago,
12 so that Israel may possess what is
left of Edom and of all the nations who
were once named as mine. This is the
word of the LORD, who will do this.
13 A time is coming, says the LORD,
when the ploughman will follow hard
on the reaper, and he who treads the
grapes after him who sows the seed. The
mountains will run with fresh wine, and
every hill will flow with it.
14 I shall restore the fortunes of my
people Israel; they will rebuild their
devastated cities and live in them, plant
vineyards and drink the wine, cultivate
gardens and eat the fruit.
15 Once more I shall plant them on
their own soil, and never again will they
be uprooted from the soil I have given
them. It is the word of the LORD your
God.Obadiah
1 THE vision of Obadiah: the words
1 of the Lord GOD about Edom. While
envoys were being dispatched among
the nations, saying, Up! Let us attack
Edom, I heard this message from the
LORD:
2 I shall make you the least of all
nations, an object of utter contempt.
3 The pride in your heart has led you
astray, you that haunt the crannies
among the rocks and make your home
on the heights, saying to yourself, Who
can bring me to the ground?
4 Though you soar as high as an eagle
and your nest is set among the stars,
even from there I shall bring you down.
This is the word of the LORD.
5 If thieves or robbers were to come to
you by night, though your loss might be
heavy, they would take only enough for
their needs; if vintagers were to come to
you, would they not leave gleanings?
6 But see how Esau is ransacked, their
secret wealth hunted out!Obadiah 1.7–13
2
7 All your former allies have pushed you
to the frontier, your confederates have
misled and subjugated you, those who
eat at your table lay a snare for your
feet. Where is his wisdom now?
8 This is the word of the LORD: On that
day I shall destroy all the wise men
of Edom and leave no wisdom on the
mountains of Esau.
9 Then your warriors, Teman, will be so
terror-stricken that no survivors will be
left on the mountains of Esau.
10 For the violence done to your brother
Jacob you will be covered with shame
and cut off for ever.
11 On the day when you stood aloof,
while strangers carried off his wealth,
while foreigners passed through his
gates and shared out Jerusalem by lot,
you were at one with them.
12 Do not gloat over your brother when
disaster strikes him, or rejoice over
Judah on the day of his ruin. Do not
boast when he suffers distress,
13 or enter my people's gates on the
day of their calamity. Do not join in the
gloating when calamity overtakes them,Obadiah 1.14–19
3
or seize their treasure on the day of their
calamity.
14 Do not stand at the crossroads to
cut down his fugitives, or betray the
survivors on the day of distress.
15 The day of the LORD is at hand for
all the nations. You will be treated as
you have treated others: your deeds will
recoil on your own head.
16 The draught you, my people, have
drunk on my holy mountain all the
nations will drink in turn; they will drink
and gulp it down and be as though they
had never been.
17 But on Mount Zion there will be a
remnant which will be holy, and Jacob
will dispossess those that dispossessed
them.
18 Then the house of Jacob will be a
fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and
the house of Esau will be stubble; they
will set it alight and burn it up, and the
house of Esau will have no survivors.
Those are the LORD's words.
19 My people will possess the Negeb, the
mountains of Esau, and the Shephelah
of the Philistines; they will possess theObadiah 1.20–21
4
countryside of Ephraim and Samaria,
and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
20 Exiles from Israel will possess Canaan
as far as Zarephath, while exiles from
Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will
possess the towns of the Negeb.
21 Those who wield authority on Mount
Zion will go up to hold sway over the
mountains of Esau, and dominion will
belong to the LORD.Jonah
1 THE word of the LORD came to
1 Jonah son of Amittai:
2 Go to the great city of Nineveh; go
and denounce it, for I am confronted by
its wickedness.
3 But to escape from the LORD Jonah
set out for Tarshish. He went down to
Joppa, where he found a ship bound for
Tarshish. He paid the fare and went on
board to travel with it to Tarshish out of
the reach of the LORD.
4 The LORD let loose a hurricane on the
sea, which rose so high that the ship
threatened to break up in the storm.
5 The sailors were terror-stricken;
everyone cried out to his own god for
help, and they threw things overboard to
lighten the ship. Meanwhile Jonah, who
had gone below deck, was lying there
fast asleep.
6 When the captain came upon him he
said, What, fast asleep? Get up and call
to your god! Perhaps he will spare a
thought for us, and we shall not perish.Jonah 1.7–13
2
7 The sailors said among themselves,
Let us cast lots to find who is to blame
for our misfortune. They cast lots, and
when Jonah was singled out
8 they wanted to be told how he was
to blame. They questioned him: What
is your business? Where do you come
from? Which is your country? What is
your nationality?
9 I am a Hebrew, he answered, and I
worship the LORD the God of heaven,
who made both sea and dry land.
10 At this the sailors were even more
afraid. What is this you have done? they
said, because they knew he was trying
to escape from the LORD, for he had told
them.
11 What must we do with you to make
the sea calm for us? they asked; for it
was getting worse.
12 Pick me up and throw me overboard,
he replied; then the sea will go down. I
know it is my fault that this great storm
has struck you.
13 Though the crew rowed hard to put
back to land it was no use, for the sea
was running higher and higher.Jonah 1.14–2.3
3
14 At last they called to the LORD, Do
not let us perish, LORD, for this man's
life; do not hold us responsible for the
death of an innocent man, for all this,
LORD, is what you yourself have brought
about.
15 Then they took Jonah and threw him
overboard, and the raging of the sea
subsided.
16 Seized by a great fear of the LORD,
the men offered a sacrifice and made
vows to him.
17 The LORD ordained that a great fish
should swallow Jonah, and he remained
in its belly for three days and three
nights.
1 From the fish's belly Jonah offered
this prayer to the LORD his God:
2 In my distress I called to the LORD,
and he answered me; from deep within
Sheol I cried for help, and you heard my
voice.
3 You cast me into the depths, into the
heart of the ocean, and the flood closed
around me; all your surging waves swept
over me.
2Jonah 2.4–3.3
4
4 I thought I was banished from your
sight and should never again look
towards your holy temple.
5 The water about me rose to my
neck, for the deep was closing over me;
seaweed twined about my head
6 at the roots of the mountains; I was
sinking into a world whose bars would
hold me fast for ever. But you brought
me up, LORD my God, alive from the pit.
7 As my senses failed I remembered the
LORD, and my prayer reached you in
your holy temple.
8 Those who cling to false gods may
abandon their loyalty,
9 but I with hymns of praise shall offer
sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I
shall fulfil. Victory is the LORD's!
10 The LORD commanded the fish, and
it spewed Jonah out on the dry land.
1 A second time the word of the LORD
came to Jonah:
2 Go to the great city of Nineveh; go
and denounce it in the words I give you.
3 Jonah obeyed and went at once to
Nineveh. It was a vast city, three days'
journey across,
3Jonah 3.4–10
5
4 and Jonah began by going a day's
journey into it. Then he proclaimed: In
forty days Nineveh will be overthrown!
5 The people of Nineveh took to heart
this warning from God; they declared a
public fast, and high and low alike put on
sackcloth.
6 When the news reached the king of
Nineveh he rose from his throne, laid
aside his robes of state, covered himself
with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
7 He had this proclamation made in
Nineveh: By decree of the king and his
nobles, neither man nor beast is to touch
any food; neither herd nor flock may eat
or drink.
8 Every person and every animal is to be
covered with sackcloth. Let all pray with
fervour to God, and let them abandon
their wicked ways and the injustice they
practise.
9 It may be that God will relent and turn
from his fierce anger: and so we shall
not perish.
10 When God saw what they did and
how they gave up their wicked ways, he
relented and did not inflict on them the
punishment he had threatened.Jonah 4.1–8
6
1 This greatly displeased Jonah. In
4 anger
2 he prayed to the LORD: It is just as I
feared, LORD, when I was still in my own
country, and it was to forestall this that I
tried to escape to Tarshish. I knew that
you are a gracious and compassionate
God, long-suffering, ever constant,
always ready to relent and not inflict
punishment.
3 Now take away my life, LORD: I should
be better dead than alive.
4 Are you right to be angry? said the
LORD.
5 Jonah went out and sat down to the
east of Nineveh, where he made himself
a shelter and sat in its shade, waiting to
see what would happen in the city.
6 The LORD God ordained that a
climbing gourd should grow up above
Jonah's head to throw its shade over him
and relieve his discomfort, and he was
very glad of it.
7 But at dawn the next day God ordained
that a worm should attack the gourd,
and it withered;
8 and when the sun came up God
ordained that a scorching wind shouldJonah 4.9–11
7
blow from the east. The sun beat down
on Jonah's head till he grew faint, and
he prayed for death; I should be better
dead than alive, he said.
9 At this God asked, Are you right to
be angry over the gourd? Yes, Jonah
replied, mortally angry!
10 But the LORD said, You are sorry
about the gourd, though you did not
have the trouble of growing it, a plant
which came up one night and died the
next.
11 And should not I be sorry about the
great city of Nineveh, with its hundred
and twenty thousand people who cannot
tell their right hand from their left, as
well as cattle without number?Micah
1 THE word of the LORD which came
1 to Micah of Moresheth during the
reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah; he received it in visions
about Samaria and Jerusalem.
2 LISTEN, all you peoples; let the earth
and all who are in it give heed, so that
the Lord GOD, the Lord from his holy
temple, may bear witness among you.
3 Even now, the LORD is leaving his
dwelling-place; he comes down and
walks on the heights of the earth.
4 At his touch mountains dissolve like
wax before fire; valleys are torn open as
when torrents pour down a hillside:
5 all this for Jacob's crime and Israel's
sin. What is the crime of Jacob? Is it not
Samaria? What is the sin of Judah? Is it
not Jerusalem?
6 I shall reduce Samaria to a ruin in the
open country, a place for planting vines;
I shall hurl her stones into the valley and
lay bare her foundations.Micah 1.7–13
2
7 All her carved figures will be smashed,
all her images burnt with fire; I shall
reduce all her idols to rubble. She
amassed them out of earnings for
prostitution, and a prostitute's hire will
they become once more.
8 That is why I lament and wail,
despoiled and naked; I howl like a wolf,
mourn like a desert-owl.
9 Israel has suffered a deadly blow,
and now it has fallen on Judah; it has
reached the very gate of my people,
even Jerusalem itself.
10 Will you not tell it in Gath? Will
you not weep bitterly? In Beth-aphrah
sprinkle yourselves with dust.
11 Take to the road, you that dwell in
Shaphir! Have not the people of Zaanan
gone out in shame from their city?
Beth-ezel is a place of lamentation; she
can lend you support no longer.
12 The people of Maroth are in the
depths of despair, for disaster from the
LORD has come down to the very gate of
Jerusalem.
13 You people of Lachish, who first led
the daughter of Zion into sin, harnessMicah 1.14–2.3
3
the steeds to the chariots; in you the
crimes of Israel are to be found.
14 Therefore you must give parting gifts
to Moresheth-gath. Beth-achzib has
betrayed the kings of Israel.
15 And you too, people of Mareshah,
I shall send others to take your place;
and the glory of Israel will be hidden in
Adullam.
16 Shave the hair from your head in
mourning for the children who were your
delight; make yourself bald as a vulture,
for they have gone away from you into
exile.
1 Woe betide those who lie in bed
planning evil and wicked deeds, and
rise at daybreak to do them, knowing
that they have the power to do evil!
2 They covet fields and take them by
force; if they want a house they seize it;
they lay hands on both householder and
house, on a man and all he possesses.
3 Therefore these are the words of
the LORD: I am planning disaster for
this nation, a yoke which you cannot
remove from your necks; you will not
walk haughtily, for the hour of disaster
will have come.
2Micah 2.4–10
4
4 On that day there will be heard
this verse about you, this sorrowful
lamentation: We are utterly despoiled,
for our people's land changes hands. It
is taken away from us; our fields are
parcelled out to renegades.
5 Therefore there will be no one to allot
you any share in the LORD's assembly.
6 Do not hold forth, they say, holding
forth themselves. But do not they hold
forth about these things? Do not they
spin words?
7 House of Jacob, can one ask, Is the
LORD's patience truly at an end? Are
these his deeds? Does good not come of
his words? Is he not with those who are
upright?
8 But you are not my people; you rise
up as my enemy to my face, to strip the
cloaks from travellers who felt safe or
from men returning from the battle,
9 to drive the women of my people
from their pleasant homes, and rob their
children of my glory for ever.
10 Up and be gone! This is no resting-
place for you; to defile yourselves you
would commit any mischief however
cruel.Micah 2.11–3.4
5
11 If anyone had gone about uttering
falsehood and lies, saying: I shall hold
forth to you about wine and strong drink,
his holding forth would be just what this
people likes.
12 I shall assemble you, the whole
house of Jacob; I shall gather together
those that are left in Israel. I shall herd
them like sheep into a fold, like a flock
in the pasture, moved away by men.
13 Their leader breaks out before them,
and they all break through the gate and
go out with their King going before them,
the LORD leading the way.
1 I said: Listen, you leaders of Jacob,
rulers of Israel, surely it is for you to
know what is right,
2 and yet you hate good and love evil;
you flay the skin of my people and tear
the flesh from their bones.
3 They devour the flesh of my people,
strip off their skin, lay bare their bones;
they cut them up like flesh for the pot,
like meat for the cauldron.
4 Then they will call to the LORD, but he
will not answer. When that time comes
he will hide his face from them, so
wicked are their deeds.
3Micah 3.5–11
6
5 These are the words of the LORD
about the prophets who lead my people
astray, who promise prosperity in return
for food, but declare open war against
those who give them nothing to eat:
6 For you night will bring no vision,
darkness no divination; the sun will go
down on the prophets, daytime will be
blackness over them.
7 Seers and diviners alike will be
overcome with shame; they will all put
their hands over their mouths, for there
is no answer from God.
8 But I am full of strength, of justice
and power, to declare to Jacob his crime,
to Israel his sin.
9 Listen to this, leaders of Jacob, you
rulers of Israel, who abhor what is right
and pervert what is straight,
10 building Zion with bloodshed,
Jerusalem with iniquity.
11 Her leaders sell verdicts for a bribe,
her priests give rulings for payment, her
prophets practise divination for money,
yet claim the LORD's authority. Is not
the LORD in our midst? they say. No
disaster can befall us.Micah 3.12–4.4
7
12 Therefore, because of you Zion will
become a ploughed field, Jerusalem a
heap of ruins, and the temple mount
rough moorland.
1 IN days to come the mountain of
the LORD's house will be established
higher than all other mountains,
towering above other hills. Peoples will
stream towards it;
2 many nations will go, saying, Let us go
up to the mountain of the LORD, to the
house of Jacob's God, that he may teach
us his ways and we may walk in his
paths. For instruction issues from Zion,
the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
3 He will be judge between many
peoples and arbiter among great and
distant nations. They will hammer their
swords into mattocks and their spears
into pruning-knives. Nation will not take
up sword against nation; they will never
again be trained for war.
4 Each man will sit under his own vine
or his own fig tree, with none to cause
alarm. The LORD of Hosts himself has
spoken.
4Micah 4.5–10
8
5 Other peoples may be loyal to their
own deities, but our loyalty will be for
ever to the LORD our God.
6 On that day, says the LORD, I shall
gather those who are lost; I shall
assemble the dispersed and those I have
afflicted.
7 I shall restore the lost as a remnant
and turn the outcasts into a mighty
nation. The LORD will be their king on
Mount Zion for ever from that time
forward.
8 And you, watch-tower of the flock, hill
of Zion, the promises made to you will be
fulfilled, and your former sovereignty will
come again, the dominion of Jerusalem.
9 Why are you now crying out in
distress? Have you no king, no
counsellor left, that you are seized with
writhing like a woman in labour?
10 Zion, writhe and shout like a woman
in childbirth, for now you must leave the
city and camp in the open country. You
must go to Babylon; there you will be
saved; there the LORD will deliver you
from your enemies.Micah 4.11–5.4
9
11 But now many nations are massed
against you; they say, Let her suffer
outrage; let us gloat over Zion.
12 They do not know the LORD's
thoughts or understand his purpose; for
he has gathered them like sheaves to
the threshing-floor.
13 Start your threshing, you people of
Zion; for I shall make your horns iron,
your hoofs bronze, and you will crush
many peoples. You are to devote their
ill-gotten gain to the LORD, their wealth
to the LORD of all the earth.
1 Now withdraw behind your walls,
you people of a walled city; the siege
is pressed home against you: Israel's
ruler is struck on the cheek with a rod.
2 But from you, Bethlehem in Ephrathah,
small as you are among Judah's clans,
from you will come a king for me over
Israel, one whose origins are far back in
the past, in ancient times.
3 Therefore only until she who is
pregnant has given birth will he give up
Israel; and then those of the people that
survive will rejoin their brethren.
4 He will rise up to lead them in the
strength of the LORD, in the majesty of
5Micah 5.5–8
10
the name of the LORD his God. They will
enjoy security, for then his greatness will
reach to the ends of the earth.
5 Then there will be peace. Should the
Assyrians invade our land, should they
overrun our strongholds, we shall raise
against them some seven or eight men
to be rulers and princes.
6 They will rule Assyria with the sword
and the land of Nimrod with drawn
blades. They will deliver us from the
Assyrians, should they invade our land,
should they encroach on our frontiers.
7 All that are left of Jacob, dispersed
among many peoples, will be like dew
from the LORD, like copious rain on the
grass, which does not wait for mortal
command or linger for any mortal's
bidding.
8 All that are left of Jacob among the
nations, dispersed among many peoples,
will be like a lion among the beasts of
the forest, like a young lion at large in
a flock of sheep; running through he
will trample and tear, with no rescuer in
sight.Micah 5.9–6.2
11
9 Your hand will be raised high over
your foes, and all your enemies will be
destroyed!
10 On that day, says the LORD, I shall
slaughter your horses and destroy your
chariots.
11 I shall devastate the cities of your
land and raze your fortresses to the
ground.
12 I shall destroy your sorcerers, and
there will be no more soothsayers among
you.
13 I shall cut down your images and
your sacred pillars; you will no longer
bow before things your hands have
made.
14 I shall pull up your sacred poles and
demolish your blood-spattered altars.
15 In anger and fury I shall wreak
vengeance on the nations who disobey
me.
1 HEAR what the LORD is saying:
Stand up and state your case before
the mountains; let the hills hear your
plea.
2 Hear the LORD's case, you mountains;
listen, you pillars that support the earth,
6Micah 6.3–8
12
for the LORD has a case against his
people, and will argue it with Israel.
3 My people, what have I done to you?
How have I wearied you? Bring your
charges!
4 I brought you up from Egypt, I set
you free from the land of slavery, I sent
Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
5 My people, remember the plans
devised by King Balak of Moab, and
how Balaam son of Beor answered
him; consider the crossing from Shittim
to Gilgal, so that you may know the
victories of the LORD.
6 What shall I bring when I come before
the LORD, when I bow before God on
high? Am I to come before him with
whole-offerings, with yearling calves?
7 Will the LORD be pleased with
thousands of rams or ten thousand rivers
of oil? Shall I offer my eldest son for my
wrongdoing, my child for the sin I have
committed?
8 The LORD has told you mortals what
is good, and what it is that the LORD
requires of you: only to act justly, to love
loyalty, to walk humbly with your God.Micah 6.9–16
13
9 The LORD calls to the city (the fear of
his name brings success): Listen, you
tribe and assembled citizens,
10 can I forgive the false measure, the
accursed short bushel?
11 Can I connive at misleading scales or
a bag of fraudulent weights?
12 The rich men of the city are steeped
in violence; her citizens are all liars, their
tongues utter deceit.
13 But now I inflict severe punishment
on you, bringing you to ruin for your
sins:
14 you will eat, but not be satisfied;
your food will lie heavy in your stomach;
you will come to labour, but not bring
forth; even if you bear a child I shall give
it to the sword;
15 you will sow, but not reap; you will
press the olives, but not use the oil; you
will tread the grapes, but not drink the
wine.
16 You have kept the precepts of Omri
and all the practices of Ahab; you have
adopted all their policies. So I shall lay
you utterly waste; your citizens will be
an object of horror, and you will endure
the insults aimed at my people.Micah 7.1–7
14
1 ALAS! I am now like the last
7 gatherings of summer fruit, the last
gleanings of the vintage, when there are
no grapes left to eat, none of those early
figs I love so much.
2 The faithful have vanished from the
land; not one honest person is to be
found. All who remain lie in wait to do
murder; each one hunts his kinsman
with a net.
3 They are bent on devising wrong --
the grasping officer, the venal judge, and
the powerful man who follows his own
desires.
4 Their goodness is twisted like rank
weeds and their honesty like briars. The
day of their punishment has come; now
confusion seizes them.
5 Put no trust in a neighbour, no
confidence in a close friend. Seal your
lips even from your wife whom you love.
6 Son maligns father, daughter rebels
against mother, daughter-in-law against
mother-in-law, and a person's enemies
are found under his own roof.
7 But I shall watch for the LORD, I shall
wait for God my saviour; my God will
hear me.Micah 7.8–14
15
8 My enemies, do not exult over me.
Though I have fallen, I shall rise again;
though I live in darkness, the LORD is
my light.
9 Because I have sinned against the
LORD, I must bear his anger, until
he champions my cause and gives
judgement for me, until he brings me
into the light, and with gladness I see
his justice.
10 When my enemies see it, they are
confounded, those who said to me,
Where is the LORD your God? I shall
gloat over them; let them be trampled
like mud in the streets.
11 That will be a day for rebuilding your
walls, a day when your boundaries will
be extended,
12 a day when your people will return to
you, from Assyria to Egypt, from Egypt
to the Euphrates, from every sea and
every mountain.
13 The earth will be a waste because of
its inhabitants; this will be as their deeds
deserve.
14 Shepherd your people with your
crook, the flock that is your own, that
lives apart on a moor with meadows allMicah 7.15–20
16
around; let them graze in Bashan and
Gilead, as in days gone by.
15 Show us miracles as in the days when
you came out of Egypt.
16 Let nations see and be confounded
by their impotence, let them keep their
mouths shut tight, let their ears be
stopped.
17 May they lick the dust like snakes,
like creatures that crawl on the ground.
Let them come trembling from their
strongholds to the LORD our God; let
them approach with awe and fear.
18 Who is a god like you? You take away
guilt, you forgive the sins of the remnant
of your people. You do not let your anger
rage for ever, for to be merciful is your
true delight.
19 Once more you will show us
compassion and wash away our guilt,
casting all our sins into the depths of the
sea.
20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob,
unfailing mercy to Abraham, as you
swore to our forefathers in days gone by.Nahum
1 AN oracle about Nineveh: the book
1 of the vision of Nahum from Elkosh.
2 THE LORD is a jealous God, a God of
vengeance; the LORD takes vengeance
and is quick to anger. The LORD takes
vengeance on his adversaries and directs
his wrath against his enemies.
3 The LORD is long-suffering and of
great might, but he will not let the guilty
escape punishment. His path is in the
whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are
the fine dust beneath his feet.
4 He rebukes the sea and dries it up
and makes all the rivers fail. Bashan and
Carmel languish, and on Lebanon the
young shoots wither.
5 The mountains quake before him, and
the hills dissolve; the earth is in tumult
at his presence, the world and all who
live in it.
6 Who can stand before his wrath? Who
can resist the fury of his anger? His rage
is poured out like fire, and the rocks are
dislodged before him.Nahum 1.7–14
2
7 The LORD is a sure protection in time
of trouble, and cares for all who make
him their refuge.
8 With a raging flood he makes an end
of those who oppose him, and pursues
his enemies into darkness.
9 Why do you make plots against the
LORD? He will make an end of you, and
you will suffer affliction once and for all.
10 Like a thicket of tangled briars, like
dry stubble, they are utterly consumed.
11 From you, Nineveh, has come forth
a wicked counsellor, one who plots evil
against the LORD.
12 THESE are the words of the LORD:
Judah, though your punishment has
been great, yet it will pass away and be
gone. I have afflicted you, but I shall not
afflict you again.
13 Now I shall break his yoke from your
necks and snap the cords that bind you.
14 Nineveh, this is what the LORD has
ordained for you: No more children will
be born to you; I shall hew down image
and idol in the temples of your gods; I
shall prepare your grave, for you are of
no account.Nahum 1.15–2.6
3
15 There on the mountains are the feet
of the herald who proclaims good news!
Keep your pilgrim-feasts, Judah, and
fulfil your vows. The wicked will never
again overrun you; they are totally
destroyed.
1 THE aggressor is coming against
you. Man the ramparts, keep a watch
on the road, brace yourselves, exert
your strength!
2 The LORD will restore the pride of
Jacob and Israel alike, for pillagers have
despoiled them and ravaged their vines.
3 The shields of their warriors are
gleaming red, their fighting men are all
in scarlet; their chariots in battle line
flash like fire. The squadrons of horse
advance;
4 they charge madly on the city, they
storm through the outskirts, like torches,
like the zigzag of lightning.
5 The leaders display their prowess,
rushing in headlong career; they dash to
the city wall, and mantelets are set in
position.
6 The floodgates of the rivers are
opened, the palace topples down;
2Nahum 2.7–13
4
7 the train of captives goes into exile,
their slave-girls are carried off, moaning
like doves and beating their breasts.
8 Nineveh is like a pool of water ebbing
away. The cry goes up, Stop! Stop! but
none turn back.
9 Spoil is taken, spoil of silver and gold;
there is no end to its store, treasure
costly beyond all desire.
10 Plundered, pillaged, despoiled!
Courage failing and knees giving way,
limbs in turmoil, and every face drained
of colour!
11 Where now is the lion's den, the cave
in which the lion cubs lived, to which
lion, lioness, and cubs made their way
with none to scare them?
12 The lion tore prey for its cubs, for
its lionesses it broke its victim's neck;
it filled its lairs with prey, its dens with
flesh it had torn.
13 As you see, I am against you, says
the LORD of Hosts; I shall smoke out
your den, and the sword will devour your
young lions. I shall cut off the prey you
have taken on the earth, and the voices
of your envoys will no more be heard.Nahum 3.1–8
5
1 Woe betide the blood-stained city,
3 steeped in deceit, full of pillage,
never empty of prey!
2 The crack of the whip, the rattle of
wheels, the stamping of horses, swaying
chariots,
3 rearing chargers, the gleam of swords,
the flash of spears! Myriads of slain,
heaps of corpses, bodies innumerable,
and men stumbling over them --
4 all for the persistent harlotry of a
harlot, the alluring mistress of sorcery,
who by her harlotry and sorceries
beguiled nations and peoples.
5 I am against you, says the LORD of
Hosts, I shall tear off your skirts to your
disgrace and expose your naked body
to every nation, your shame to every
kingdom.
6 I shall pelt you with loathsome filth; I
shall hold you in contempt and make a
spectacle of you.
7 Then all who see you will shrink from
you and say, Nineveh is laid waste! Who
will console her? Where shall I look for
anyone to comfort you?
8 Will you fare better than No-amon,
situated by the streams of the Nile andNahum 3.9–15
6
encompassed by water, whose rampart
was the Nile, whose wall was water?
9 Cush and Egypt were a source of
endless strength to her, Put and the
Libyans were her allies.
10 Even she became an exile and went
into captivity, even her infants were
dashed to the ground at every street
corner, her nobles were shared out by
lot, all her great men were thrown into
chains.
11 You also will drink the cup of wrath
until you are overcome; you also will flee
for refuge from the enemy.
12 All your fortifications are like the
first ripe figs: shaken, they fall into the
mouth of the eater.
13 Your troops behave like women. The
gates of your country stand open to the
enemy; fire has consumed the barred
gates.
14 Draw yourselves water for the siege,
strengthen your fortifications; go down
into the clay, trample the mortar, repair
the brickwork of the fort.
15 Even there the fire will consume you,
and the sword will cut you off. MakeNahum 3.16–19
7
yourselves as many as the locusts, make
yourselves as many as the hoppers.
16 You have spies as numerous as the
stars in the sky, like hoppers which raid
and then fly away.
17 Your agents are like locusts, your
commanders like the hoppers which lie
dormant in the walls on a cold day; but
when the sun rises, they make off, no
one knows where.
18 Your rulers slumber, king of Assyria,
your leaders are asleep; your people are
scattered over the mountains, with no
one to round them up.
19 Your wounds cannot be relieved, your
injury is mortal; all who hear of your
fate clap their hands in joy. Who has not
suffered your relentless cruelty?Habakkuk
1 AN oracle which the prophet
1 Habakkuk received in a vision.
2 HOW LONG, LORD, will you be deaf to
my plea? Violence! I cry out to you, but
you do not come to the rescue.
3 Why do you let me look on such
wickedness, why let me see such
wrongdoing? Havoc and violence
confront me, strife breaks out, discord
arises.
4 Therefore law becomes ineffective,
and justice is defeated; the wicked
hem in the righteous, so that justice is
perverted.
5 Look around among the nations; see
there a sight which will utterly astound
you; you will not believe it when you are
told what is being done in your days:
6 I am raising up the Chaldaeans, that
savage and impetuous nation, who
march far and wide over the earth to
seize and occupy what is not theirs.Habakkuk 1.7–13
2
7 Fear and terror go with them;
they impose their own justice and
judgements.
8 Their horses are swifter than leopards,
keener than the wolves of the plain; their
cavalry prance and gallop, swooping
from afar like vultures to devour the
prey.
9 Bent on violence, their whole army
advances, a horde moving onward like
an east wind; they round up captives
countless as the sand.
10 They hold kings in derision, they
make light of rulers; they laugh at every
fortress and raise siege-works to capture
them.
11 Then they sweep on like the wind and
are gone; they ascribe their strength to
their gods.
12 LORD, are you not from ancient times
my God and Holy One, who is immortal?
LORD, you have appointed them to
execute judgement; my Rock, you have
commissioned them to punish.
13 Your eyes are too pure to look on evil;
you cannot countenance wrongdoing.
Why then do you countenance the
treachery of the wicked? Why keep silentHabakkuk 1.14–2.3
3
when they devour those who are more
righteous?
14 You have made people like the fish of
the sea, like creeping creatures with no
ruler over them.
15 The wicked haul them up with hooks
or catch them in their nets or drag them
in their trawls. So they make merry and
rejoice,
16 offering sacrifices to their nets and
burning offerings to their trawls, for
it is thanks to them that they live
sumptuously and enjoy rich fare.
17 Are they to draw the sword every day
to slaughter the nations pitilessly?
1 I shall stand at my post, I shall take
up my position on the watch-tower,
keeping a look-out to learn what he
says to me, how he responds to my
complaint.
2 The LORD gives me this answer:
Write down a vision, inscribe it clearly
on tablets, so that it may be read at a
glance.
3 There is still a vision for the appointed
time; it will testify to the destined hour
and will not prove false. Though it
2Habakkuk 2.4–9
4
delays, wait for it, for it will surely come
before too long.
4 The reckless will lack an assured
future, while the righteous will live by
being faithful.
5 As for one who is conceited,
treacherous, and arrogant, still less
will he reach his goal; his throat gapes
as wide as Sheol and he is insatiable
as Death, rounding up every nation,
gathering in all peoples to himself.
6 Surely with veiled taunts and insults
they will all turn on him and say, Woe
betide the person who amasses wealth
that is not his and enriches himself with
goods taken in pledge!
7 Will not your debtors suddenly start
up? Will not those be roused who will
shake you till you are empty? Will you
not fall a victim to them?
8 Because you yourself have plundered
many nations, because of the bloodshed
and violence you inflicted on cities and
all their inhabitants over the earth, now
the rest of the world will plunder you.
9 Woe betide the person who seeks
unjust gain for his house, building hisHabakkuk 2.10–16
5
nest on a height to save himself from the
onset of disaster!
10 Your schemes to overthrow many
nations will bring dishonour to your
house and put your own life in jeopardy.
11 The stones will cry out from the wall,
and from the timbers a beam will answer
them.
12 Woe betide the person who has built
a city with bloodshed and founded a
town on injustice,
13 so that nations toil for a pittance,
peoples weary themselves for a mere
nothing! Is not all this the doing of the
LORD of Hosts?
14 The earth will be full of the knowledge
of the LORD's glory as the waters fill the
sea.
15 Woe betide the person who makes
his companions drink the outpouring
of God's wrath, making them drunk to
watch their naked orgies!
16 You will drink deep draughts, not of
glory but of shame, drinking in your turn
until you stagger. The cup in the LORD's
right hand is passed to you, and your
shame will exceed your glory.Habakkuk 2.17–3.3
6
17 The violence done to Lebanon will
overwhelm you, the havoc wrought on
its beasts will shatter you, because of
the bloodshed and violence you inflicted
on cities and all their inhabitants over
the earth.
18 What use is an idol after its maker
has shaped it? It is only an image, a
source of lies! What use is it when the
maker trusts what he has made? He is
only making dumb idols!
19 Woe betide the person who says to
a block of wood, Wake up, to a lifeless
stone, Bestir yourself! Overlaid with gold
and silver it may be, but there is no
breath in it.
20 The LORD is in his holy temple; let all
the earth be silent in his presence.
1 A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk:
according to shigionoth
2 LORD, I have heard of your fame;
LORD, I am in awe of what you have
done. Through all generations you have
made yourself known, and in your wrath
you did not forget mercy.
3 God comes from Teman, the Holy One
from Mount Paran; [Selah] his radiance
3Habakkuk 3.4–11
7
covers the sky, and his splendour fills
the earth.
4 His brightness is like the dawn, rays of
light flash from his hand, and thereby
his might is veiled.
5 Pestilence stalks before him, and
plague follows close behind.
6 When he stands, the earth shakes;
at his glance the nations panic; the
everlasting mountains are riven, the
ancient hills sink down. He journeys as
he did of old.
7 The tents of Cushan are wrecked, the
tent curtains of Midian flutter.
8 LORD, are you angry with the
streams? Is your rage against the rivers,
your wrath against the sea, that your
steeds are mounted and you ride your
chariots to victory?
9 You draw your bow from its case and
charge your quiver with arrows. [Selah]
You cleave the earth with streams;
10 the mountains see you and writhe
with fear. The torrent of water rushes by
and the deep thunders aloud.
11 At the gleam of your speeding arrows
and the glint of your flashing spear, theHabakkuk 3.12–19
8
sun forgets to turn in its course and the
moon stands still at its zenith.
12 Furiously you traverse the earth; in
anger you trample down the nations.
13 You go forth to save your people,
to save your anointed one. You shatter
the house of the wicked, laying bare its
foundations to the bedrock. [Selah]
14 You pierce their chiefs with your
arrows; their leaders are swept away by
a whirlwind, as they open their jaws to
devour their wretched victims in secret.
15 When you tread the sea with your
steeds the mighty waters foam.
16 I hear, and my body quakes; my
lips quiver at the sound; weakness
overcomes my limbs, and my feet totter
in their tracks; I long for the day of
disaster to dawn over our assailants.
17 The fig tree has no buds, the vines
bear no harvest, the olive crop fails, the
orchards yield no food, the fold is bereft
of its flock, and there are no cattle in the
stalls.
18 Even so I shall exult in the LORD and
rejoice in the God who saves me.
19 The LORD God is my strength; he
makes me as sure-footed as a hind andHabakkuk 3.19
sets my feet on the heights. For the
leader: with stringed instruments
9Zephaniah
1 THIS is the word of the LORD which
1 came to Zephaniah son of Cushi,
son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of
Hezekiah, when Josiah son of Amon was
king of Judah.
2 I SHALL utterly destroy everything
from the face of the earth, says the
LORD.
3 I shall destroy human beings and
animals, the birds of the air and the fish
in the sea. I shall bring the wicked to
their knees and wipe out all people from
the earth. This is the word of the LORD.
4 I shall stretch my hand over Judah,
over all who live in Jerusalem. I shall
wipe out from that place the last remnant
of Baal, every memory of the heathen
priests,
5 those who bow down on the housetops
to the host of heaven, those who swear
by Milcom,
6 who have turned their backs on the
LORD, who have neither sought the
LORD nor consulted him.Zephaniah 1.7–12
2
7 Keep silent in the presence of the Lord
GOD, for the day of the LORD is near.
The LORD has prepared a sacrifice and
set apart those he has invited.
8 On the day of the LORD's sacrifice I
shall punish the royal house and its chief
officers and all who appear in foreign
apparel.
9 On that day I shall punish all who
dance on the temple terrace, who fill
their Lord's house with crimes of violence
and fraud.
10 On that day, says the LORD, a sound
of crying will be heard from the Fish
Gate, wailing from the Second Quarter of
the city; there will be a loud crash from
the hills.
11 Those who live in the Lower Town will
wail, for all the merchants are destroyed,
and the dealers in silver are all wiped
out.
12 At that time I shall search Jerusalem
by lantern-light and punish all who are
ruined by complacency like wine left on
its lees, who say to themselves, The
LORD will do nothing, neither good nor
bad.Zephaniah 1.13–2.1
3
13 Their wealth will be plundered, their
houses laid in ruins; they will build
houses but not live in them, they will
plant vineyards but not drink the wine.
14 The great day of the LORD is near,
near and coming fast; no runner is so
swift as that day, no warrior so fleet.
15 That day is a day of wrath, a day
of anguish and torment, a day of
destruction and devastation, a day of
darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and
dense fog,
16 a day of trumpet-blasts and battle
cries against the fortified cities and lofty
bastions.
17 I shall bring dire distress on the
people; they will walk like the blind
because of their sin against the LORD.
Their blood will be poured out like dust
and their bowels like dung;
18 neither their silver nor their gold will
avail to save them. On the day of the
LORD's wrath by the fire of his jealousy
the whole land will be consumed; for he
will make a sudden and terrible end of
all who live in the land.
1 Humble yourself, unruly nation; be
humble,
2Zephaniah 2.2–7
4
2 before you are driven away to
disappear like chaff, before the burning
anger of the LORD comes upon you,
before the day of the LORD's anger
comes upon you.
3 Seek the LORD, all in the land who
live humbly, obeying his laws; seek
righteousness, seek humility; it may be
that you will find shelter on the day of
the LORD's anger.
4 Gaza will be deserted, Ashkelon left
a waste; the people of Ashdod will be
driven out at noonday, and Ekron will be
uprooted.
5 Woe betide you Kerethites who live
by the coast! This word of the LORD
is spoken against you: Land of the
Philistines, I shall crush you, I shall lay
you in ruins, bereft of inhabitants.
6 Kereth will become pastures and
sheepfolds,
7 and the coastland will belong to the
survivors of Judah. They will pasture
their flocks by the sea and lie down at
evening in the houses at Ashkelon, for
the LORD their God will turn to them and
restore their fortunes.Zephaniah 2.8–14
5
8 I have heard the insults of Moab,
the taunts of the Ammonites, how they
reviled my people and encroached on
their frontiers.
9 For this, by my life, says the LORD
of Hosts, the God of Israel, Moab
shall become like Sodom, Ammon like
Gomorrah, a mass of weeds, a heap of
saltwort, waste land for evermore. Those
of my people who survive will plunder
them, the remnant of my nation will
dispossess them.
10 This will be retribution for their pride,
because they have insulted the people of
the LORD of Hosts and encroached upon
their land.
11 The LORD will bring terror on them;
he will reduce to beggary all the gods
of the earth. Then the nations in all the
coasts and islands will worship him, each
in its own land.
12 You Cushites also will be slain by the
sword of the LORD.
13 He will stretch out his hand against
the north and destroy Assyria, making
Nineveh a waste, arid as the desert.
14 Flocks will couch there, and every
kind of wild animal. The horned owl andZephaniah 2.15–3.6
6
the bustard will roost on her capitals; the
tawny owl will screech in the window,
and the raven in the doorway.
15 This is the city that exulted in her
security, saying to herself, I and I alone
am supreme. And what is she now? A
waste, a haunt of wild animals, at which
every passer-by may jeer and gesture!
1 Woe betide the tyrant city, filthy
and foul!
2 She heeded no warning voice, took
no rebuke to heart; she did not put her
trust in the LORD, nor did she draw near
to her God.
3 The leaders within her were roaring
lions, her rulers wolves of the plain that
left nothing over till morning.
4 Her prophets were reckless and
perfidious; her priests profaned the
sanctuary and did violence to the law.
5 But the LORD in her midst is just; he
does no wrong; morning after morning
he gives his judgement, every day
without fail; yet the wrongdoer knows
no shame.
6 I have wiped out this arrogant people;
their bastions are demolished. I have
destroyed their streets; no one walks
3Zephaniah 3.7–11
7
along them. Their cities are laid waste,
abandoned and unpeopled.
7 I said, Surely she will fear me; she
will take my instruction to heart, all
the commands I laid on her that her
dwelling-place might escape destruction.
But they hastened all the more to
perform their evil deeds.
8 Therefore wait for me, says the LORD,
wait for the day when I stand up to
accuse you; I have decided to gather
nations and assemble kingdoms, in
order to pour my wrath on them, all my
burning anger; the whole earth will be
consumed by the fire of my jealousy.
9 Then I shall restore pure lips to all
peoples, that they may invoke the LORD
by name and serve him with one accord.
10 My worshippers, dispersed beyond
the rivers of Cush, will bring offerings to
me.
11 ON that day, Jerusalem, you will not
be put to shame for any of the deeds
by which you have rebelled against me,
because I shall rid you then of your
proud and arrogant citizens, and never
again will you flaunt your pride on my
holy mountain.Zephaniah 3.12–19
8
12 I shall leave a remnant in you, lowly
and poor people. The survivors in Israel
will find refuge in the LORD's name.
13 They will do no wrong, nor speak
lies; no words of deceit will pass their
lips; they will feed and lie down with no
one to terrify them.
14 Zion, cry out for joy; raise the shout
of triumph, Israel; be glad, rejoice with
all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem!
15 The LORD has averted your
punishment, he has swept away your
foes. Israel, the LORD is among you as
king; never again need you fear disaster.
16 On that day this must be the message
to Jerusalem: Fear not, Zion, let not your
hands hang limp.
17 The LORD your God is in your midst,
a warrior who will keep you safe. He will
rejoice over you and be glad; he will
show you his love once more; he will
exult over you with a shout of joy
18 as on a festal day. I shall take away
your cries of woe and you will no longer
endure reproach.
19 When that time comes; I shall deal
with all who oppress you; I shall rescue
the lost and gather the dispersed. I shallZephaniah 3.20
9
win for my people praise and renown
throughout the whole world.
20 When that time comes I shall gather
you and bring you home. I shall win
you renown and praise among all the
peoples of the earth, when I restore your
fortunes before your eyes. It is the LORD
who speaks.Haggai
1 IN the second year of King Darius,
1 on the first day of the sixth month,
the word of the LORD, spoken through
the prophet Haggai, came to the
governor of Judah Zerubbabel son of
Shealtiel, and to the high priest Joshua
son of Jehozadak.
2 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: This nation says that the time has
not yet come for the house of the LORD
to be rebuilt.
3 Then this word came through Haggai
the prophet:
4 Is it a time for you yourselves to live
in your well-roofed houses, while this
house lies in ruins?
5 Now these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: Consider your way of life;
6 you have sown much but reaped little,
you eat but never enough to satisfy, you
drink but never enough to cheer you,
you are clothed but never warm, and he
who earns wages puts them into a purse
with a hole in it.Haggai 1.7–12
2
7 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Consider your way of life.
8 Go up into the hill-country, fetch
timber, and build a house acceptable to
me, where I can reveal my glory, says
the LORD.
9 You look for much and get little and
when you bring home the harvest I blast
it away. And why? says the LORD of
Hosts. Because my house lies in ruins,
while each of you has a house he can
hurry to.
10 It is your fault that the heavens
withhold their moisture and the earth its
produce.
11 So I have proclaimed a drought
against land and mountain, against
grain, new wine, and oil, and everything
that the ground yields, against human
beings and cattle and all the products of
your labour.
12 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua
son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and
all the rest of the people listened to the
words of the LORD their God and to what
the prophet Haggai said when the LORD
their God sent him, and they were filled
with fear because of the LORD.Haggai 1.13–2.4
3
13 So Haggai the LORD's messenger, as
the LORD had commissioned him, said
to the people: I am with you, says the
LORD.
14 Then the LORD stirred up the spirit of
the governor of Judah Zerubbabel son of
Shealtiel, of the high priest Joshua son of
Jehozadak, and of the rest of the people,
so that they went and set to work on the
house of the LORD of Hosts their God
15 on the twenty-fourth day of the
sixth month. In the second year of King
Darius,
1 on the twenty-first day of the
seventh month, these words came
from the LORD through the prophet
Haggai:
2 Say to the governor of Judah
Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, to the high
priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to
the rest of the people:
3 Is there anyone still among you who
saw this house in its former glory? How
does it appear to you now? To you does
it not seem as if it were not there?
4 But now, Zerubbabel, take heart, says
the LORD; take heart, Joshua son of
Jehozadak, high priest; take heart, all
2Haggai 2.5–11
4
you people, says the LORD. Begin the
work, for I am with you, says the LORD
of Hosts,
5 and my spirit remains among you. Do
not be afraid.
6 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: In a little while from now I
shall shake the heavens and the earth,
the sea and the dry land.
7 I shall shake all the nations, and the
treasure of all nations will come here;
and I shall fill this house with splendour,
says the LORD of Hosts.
8 Mine is the silver and mine the gold,
says the LORD of Hosts,
9 and the splendour of this latter house
will surpass the splendour of the former,
says the LORD of Hosts. In this place I
shall grant prosperity and peace. This is
the word of the LORD of Hosts.
10 In the second year of Darius, on the
twenty-fourth day of the ninth month,
this word came from the LORD to the
prophet Haggai:
11 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Ask the priests to give a ruling on
this.Haggai 2.12–18
5
12 If someone who is carrying
consecrated flesh in a fold of his robe
lets the fold touch bread or broth or wine
or oil or any food, will that also become
consecrated? The priests answered, No.
13 Haggai went on, But if a person
defiled by contact with a corpse touches
any one of these things, will that become
defiled? It will, answered the priests.
14 Haggai replied, In my view, so it
is with this people and nation and all
that they do, says the LORD; whatever
offering they make here is defiled.
15 Now look back over recent times
down to this day: before one stone was
laid on another in the LORD's temple,
16 how were you then? If someone came
to a heap of grain expecting twenty
measures, he found only ten; if he came
to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, he
found only twenty.
17 I blasted you and all your harvest
with black blight and red and with hail,
yet you had no mind to return to me,
says the LORD.
18 Consider, from this day onwards,
from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth
month, the day when the foundationsHaggai 2.19–23
6
of the temple of the LORD are laid,
consider:
19 will the seed still be diminished in
the barn? Will the vine and the fig, the
pomegranate and the olive still bear no
fruit? Not so; from this day I shall bless
you.
20 On that day, the twenty-fourth day of
the month, the word of the LORD came
to Haggai a second time:
21 Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, I
shall shake the heavens and the earth;
22 I shall overthrow the thrones of
kings, break the power of heathen
realms, overturn chariots and their
riders; horses and riders will fall by the
sword of their comrades.
23 On that day, says the LORD of Hosts,
I shall take you, Zerubbabel son of
Shealtiel, my servant, and shall wear
you as a signet ring; for it is you whom
I have chosen. This is the word of the
LORD of Hosts.Zechariah
1 IN the eighth month of the second
1 year of Darius, this word of the LORD
came to the prophet Zechariah son of
Berechiah, son of Iddo:
2 The LORD was exceedingly angry with
your forefathers.
3 Say therefore to the people: These are
the words of the LORD of Hosts: If you
return to me, I shall turn back to you,
says the LORD of Hosts.
4 Do not be like your forefathers, who
heard the prophets of old proclaim,
These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Turn back from your evil ways and
your evil deeds. They refused to listen
and pay heed to me, says the LORD.
5 Your forefathers, where are they now?
And the prophets, do they live for ever?
6 But did not the warnings and the
decrees with which I charged my
servants the prophets overtake your
forefathers? They repented and said, The
LORD of Hosts has fulfilled his intention,Zechariah 1.7–12
2
and has dealt with us as our lives and as
our deeds deserved.
7 ON the twenty-fourth day of the
eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in
the second year of Darius, the word of
the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah
son of Berechiah, son of Iddo.
8 In the night I had a vision in which
I saw a man among the myrtles in a
hollow; he was on a bay horse and
behind him were other horses, bay,
sorrel, and white.
9 What are these, sir? I asked, and
the angel who was talking with me
answered, I shall show you what they
are.
10 Then the man standing among the
myrtles said, They are those whom the
LORD has sent to range throughout the
world.
11 They reported to the angel of the
LORD who was standing among the
myrtles: We have ranged through the
world, and the whole world is quiet and
at peace.
12 The angel of the LORD then
said, LORD of Hosts, how long will
you withhold your compassion fromZechariah 1.13–18
3
Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, on
which you have vented your wrath these
seventy years?
13 In answer the LORD spoke kind and
comforting words to the angel who was
talking with me.
14 This angel then said to me: Announce
that these are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: I am very jealous for Jerusalem
and Zion,
15 but I am deeply angry with the
nations that are enjoying their ease,
because, although my anger was only
mild, they aggravated the suffering.
16 Therefore these are the words of the
LORD: I have returned to Jerusalem with
compassion; my house is to be rebuilt
there, says the LORD of Hosts, and the
measuring line will be stretched over
Jerusalem.
17 Proclaim once more: These are the
words of the LORD of Hosts: My cities
will again brim with prosperity; once
again the LORD will comfort Zion, once
again he will make Jerusalem the city of
his choice.
18 I looked up and saw four horns.Zechariah 1.19–2.4
4
19 I asked the angel who talked with me
what they were, and he answered, These
are the horns which scattered Judah,
Israel, and Jerusalem.
20 The LORD then showed me four
smiths.
21 I asked what they were coming to
do, and he said, Those horns scattered
Judah so completely that no one could
hold up his head; but these smiths
have come to rout them, overthrowing
the horns which the nations had raised
against the land of Judah to scatter its
people.
1 I looked up and saw a man carrying
a measuring line.
2 I asked him where he was going. To
measure Jerusalem and discover its
breadth and length, he replied.
3 Then, as the angel who talked with me
was going away, another angel came out
to meet him
4 and said, Run to the young man
there and tell him that Jerusalem will be
without walls, so numerous will be the
people and cattle in it.
2Zechariah 2.5–11
5
5 I myself shall be a wall of fire all
round it, says the LORD, and a glorious
presence within it.
6 Away, away! Flee from the land of
the north, says the LORD, for I have
dispersed you to the four winds of
heaven, says the LORD.
7 Away! Escape, you people of Zion who
live in Babylon.
8 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts, spoken when he sent me on a
glorious mission to the nations who have
plundered you, for whoever touches you
touches the apple of his eye:
9 I shall brandish my hand against
them, and they will be plunder for those
they enslaved. You will then know that
the LORD of Hosts has sent me.
10 Shout aloud and rejoice, daughter
of Zion! I am coming, I shall make my
dwelling among you, says the LORD.
11 Many nations will give their allegiance
to the LORD on that day and become his
people, and he will dwell in your midst.
Then you will know that the LORD of
Hosts has sent me to you.Zechariah 2.12–3.5
6
12 The LORD will claim Judah as his own
portion in the holy land, and once again
make Jerusalem the city of his choice.
13 Let all mortals be silent in the
presence of the LORD! For he has
bestirred himself and come out from his
holy dwelling-place.
1 Then he showed me Joshua the
high priest standing before the angel
of the LORD, with Satan standing at his
right hand to accuse him.
2 The angel said to Satan, The LORD
silence you, Satan! May the LORD, who
has chosen Jerusalem, silence you! Is
not this man a brand snatched from the
fire?
3 Joshua was wearing filthy clothes as
he stood before the angel,
4 who now said to those in attendance
on him, Take off his filthy clothes. Then
to Joshua he said, See how I have taken
away your guilt from you; and I shall
clothe you in fine vestments.
5 Let a clean turban be put on his head,
he ordered. So while the angel of the
LORD stood by, they put a clean turban
on his head and clothed him in clean
garments.
3Zechariah 3.6–4.2
7
6 The angel gave Joshua this solemn
charge:
7 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: If you conform to my ways and
carry out your duties towards me, you
are to administer my house and be in
control of my courts, and I shall grant
you the right to come and go amongst
these in attendance here.
8 Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and
your colleagues seated here before you,
for they are an omen of good things to
come: I shall now bring my servant, the
Branch.
9 In a single day I shall wipe away the
guilt of this land. On that day, says the
LORD of Hosts, you are to invite each
other to come and sit under your vines
and fig trees. Here is the stone that I
set before Joshua, a stone on which are
seven eyes. I shall reveal its meaning to
you, says the LORD of Hosts.
10 (3:9)
1 The angel who talked with me came
back and roused me as someone is
roused from sleep.
2 He asked me what I saw, and I
answered, A lampstand entirely of gold,
4Zechariah 4.3–9
8
with a bowl on it. It holds seven lamps,
and there are seven pipes for the lamps
on top of it.
3 There are also two olive trees standing
by it, one on the right and the other on
the left.
4 I asked the angel of the LORD who
talked with me, Sir, what are these?
5 He answered, Do you not know what
they are? No, sir, I answered. These
seven, he said, are the eyes of the LORD
which range over the whole earth.
6 Then he said to me, This is the word
of the LORD concerning Zerubbabel:
Neither by force nor by strength, but by
my spirit! says the LORD of Hosts.
7 How does a mountain, the greatest
mountain, compare with Zerubbabel? It
is no higher than a plain. He will bring
out the stone called Foundation while the
people shout, All blessing be upon it!
8 There came this word from the LORD
to me:
9 Zerubbabel with his own hands laid
the foundation of this house; with his
own hands he will finish it. So you will
know that the LORD of Hosts has sent
me to you.Zechariah 4.10–5.4
9
10 Who has despised the day of small
things? The people will rejoice when they
see Zerubbabel holding the stone called
Separation.
11 What are these two olive trees on the
right and on the left of the lampstand?
12 I put a further question to him, What
are the two sprays of olive beside the
golden pipes which discharge the golden
oil?
13 He said, Do you not know what they
mean? No, sir, I answered.
14 These, he said, are the two
consecrated with oil who attend the Lord
of all the earth.
1 I looked up again and saw a flying
scroll.
2 He asked me what I saw, and I
answered, I see a flying scroll, twenty
cubits long and ten cubits wide.
3 He told me: This is the curse which
goes out over the whole land; for
according to the writing on one side
every thief will be swept away, and
according to the writing on the other
every perjurer will be swept away.
4 I have sent it out, says the LORD of
Hosts, and it will enter the house of the
5Zechariah 5.5–11
10
thief and the house of the man who has
committed perjury in my name; it will
stay inside the house and demolish it,
both timber and stone.
5 The angel who talked with me came
out and said, Look at this thing that is
coming.
6 I asked what it was, and he said,
The thing that is coming is a barrel for
measuring; and he added, it is a symbol
of the people's guilt throughout the land.
7 Then its round, leaden cover was
raised, and there was a woman sitting
inside the barrel.
8 He said, This is Wickedness, and he
thrust her down into the barrel and
pressed the leaden weight down on the
opening.
9 I looked up again and saw two women
coming forth with the wind in their wings
(for they had wings like those of a stork),
and they lifted up the barrel midway
between earth and sky.
10 I asked the angel who talked with me
where they were taking the barrel,
11 and he answered, To build a house for
it in the land of Shinar; once the houseZechariah 6.1–9
11
is ready, the barrel will be set there on
the place prepared for it.
1 I looked up again and saw four
chariots coming out between two
mountains, which were mountains of
copper.
2 The first chariot had bay horses, the
second black,
3 the third white, and the fourth
dappled.
4 I asked the angel who talked with me,
Sir, what are these?
5 He answered, These are the four
winds of heaven; after attending the
Lord of the whole earth, they are now
going forth.
6 The chariot with the black horses is
going to the land of the north, that with
the white to the far west, that with the
dappled to the south,
7 and that with the roan to the land of
the east. They were eager to set off and
range over the whole earth. Go, he said,
range over the earth, and they did so.
8 Then he called me to look and said,
Those going to the land of the north
have made my spirit rest on that land.
9 THE word of the LORD came to me:
6Zechariah 6.10–15
12
10 Receive the gifts from the exiles
Heldai, Tobiah, and Jedaiah who have
returned from Babylon, and go the
same day to the house of Josiah son of
Zephaniah.
11 Take the silver and gold and make a
crown; place it on the head of the high
priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak,
12 and say to him: These are the words
of the LORD of Hosts: Here is a man
whose name is Branch; he will branch
out from where he is and rebuild the
temple of the LORD.
13 It is he who will rebuild the temple,
he who will assume royal dignity, who
will sit on his throne as ruler. There will
be a priest beside his throne, and there
will be harmony between them.
14 The crown will serve as a memorial
for Heldai, Tobiah, Jedaiah, and Josiah
son of Zephaniah in the temple of the
LORD.
15 Men from far away will come and
work on the rebuilding of the temple
of the LORD; so you will know that the
LORD of Hosts has sent me to you. This
will come about if you hearken with
diligence to the LORD your God!Zechariah 7.1–7
13
1 THE word of the LORD came to
7 Zechariah in the fourth year of King
Darius, on the fourth day of Kislev, the
ninth month.
2 Bethel-sharezer sent Regem-melech
together with his men to entreat the
favour of the LORD.
3 They were to say to the priests in the
house of the LORD of Hosts and to the
prophets, Am I to lament and fast in the
fifth month as I have done these many
years?
4 Then the word of the LORD of Hosts
came to me:
5 Say to all the people of the land and
to the priests: When you fasted and
lamented in the fifth and seventh months
these past seventy years, was it indeed
with me in mind that you fasted?
6 And when you ate and drank, was it
not to please yourselves?
7 Was it not this that the LORD
proclaimed through the prophets of
old, while Jerusalem was populous and
peaceful, as were the towns round
about, and there were people settled in
the Negeb and the Shephelah?Zechariah 7.8–8.1
14
8 The word of the LORD came to
Zechariah:
9 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Administer true justice, show
kindness and compassion to each other,
10 do not oppress the widow or the
fatherless, the resident alien or the poor,
and do not plot evil against one another.
11 But they refused to listen; they
turned their backs defiantly on me, they
stopped their ears so as not to hear.
12 They were adamant in their refusal
to accept the law and the teaching which
the LORD of Hosts had sent by his spirit
through the prophets of old; and in great
anger the LORD of Hosts said:
13 As they did not listen when I called,
so I would not listen when they called.
14 I drove them out among all the
nations where they were strangers,
leaving their land deserted behind them,
so that no one came and went. Thus
their pleasant land was turned into a
desert.
1 The word of the LORD of Hosts
came to me:
8Zechariah 8.2–8
15
2 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: I have been very jealous for Zion,
fiercely jealous for her.
3 Now, says the LORD, I shall come
back to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem.
Jerusalem will be called the City of
Faithfulness, and the mountain of the
LORD of Hosts will be called the Holy
Mountain.
4 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Once again old men and women
will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each
leaning on a stick because of great age;
5 and the streets of the city will be full
of boys and girls at play.
6 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Even if this may seem impossible
to the remnant of this nation in those
days, will it also seem impossible to me?
This is the word of the LORD of Hosts.
7 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: I am about to rescue my people
from the countries in the east and the
west,
8 and bring them back to live in
Jerusalem. They will be my people, and
I shall be their God, in faithfulness and
justice.Zechariah 8.9–14
16
9 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Take heart, all who now hear the
promise that the temple is to be rebuilt;
you hear it from the prophets who were
present when foundations for the house
of the LORD of Hosts were laid.
10 Before that time there was no
hiring of people or animals; because
of enemies, no one could go about his
business in safety, for I had set everyone
at odds with everyone else.
11 But I do not feel the same now
towards the remnant of this people as
I did in former days, says the LORD of
Hosts.
12 For they will sow in safety; the vine
will yield its fruit and the soil its produce,
and the heavens will give their moisture;
with all these things I shall endow the
remnant of this people.
13 To the nations you, house of Judah
and house of Israel, have become
proverbial as a curse; now I shall save
you, and you will become proverbial as a
blessing. Courage! Do not lose heart.
14 For these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: Whereas I resolved to bring
disaster on you when your forefathersZechariah 8.15–21
17
provoked my wrath, says the LORD of
Hosts, and I did not relent,
15 so I have resolved to do good again
in these days to Jerusalem and to the
house of Judah. Do not be afraid.
16 This is what you must do: speak the
truth to each other, administer true and
sound justice in your courts.
17 Do not plot evil against one another,
and do not love perjury, for all these are
things I hate. This is the word of the
LORD.
18 The word of the LORD of Hosts came
to me:
19 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: The fasts of the fourth month,
and of the fifth, seventh, and tenth
months, are to become festivals of joy
and gladness for the house of Judah. So
love truth and peace.
20 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: Nations and dwellers in many
cities will come in the future;
21 people of one city will approach those
of another and say, Let us go to entreat
the favour of the LORD; let us resort to
the LORD of Hosts; and I too shall go.Zechariah 8.22–9.5
18
22 Many peoples and mighty nations will
resort to the LORD of Hosts in Jerusalem
and entreat his favour.
23 These are the words of the LORD of
Hosts: In those days, ten people from
nations of every language will take hold
of the robe of one Jew and say, Let us
accompany you, for we have heard that
God is with you.
1 AN oracle: The word of the LORD is
in the land of Hadrach; it alights on
Damascus, for, no less than all the tribes
of Israel, the capital of Aram belongs to
the LORD.
2 It alights also on Hamath which
borders on Damascus, and for all their
wisdom it alights on Tyre and Sidon.
3 Tyre, who built herself a rampart, has
amassed silver like dust and gold like the
dirt on the streets.
4 But the Lord will take from her all she
possesses; he will break her power at
sea, and the city itself will be destroyed
by fire.
5 Let Ashkelon see and be afraid; Gaza
will writhe in terror, and Ekron's hope
will come to naught. Kings will vanish
9Zechariah 9.6–10
19
from Gaza, and Ashkelon will be empty
of people.
6 A mixed race will settle in Ashdod,
and I shall cut down the pride of the
Philistines.
7 I shall stop them eating flesh with the
blood still in it and feeding on detestable
things. Those who survive will belong to
our God; they will be like a clan in Judah,
and Ekron will become like the Jebusites.
8 I shall post a garrison for my house
so that none may pass to and fro that
way, and no oppressor may ever again
overrun them, for now I am taking note
of their suffering.
9 Daughter of Zion, rejoice with all your
heart; shout in triumph, daughter of
Jerusalem! See, your king is coming to
you, his cause won, his victory gained,
humble and mounted on a donkey, on a
colt, the foal of a donkey.
10 He will banish the chariot from
Ephraim, the war-horse from Jerusalem;
the warrior's bow will be banished, and
he will proclaim peace to the nations. His
rule will extend from sea to sea, from
the River to the ends of the earth.Zechariah 9.11–16
20
11 As for you, because of your blood
covenant with me I shall release your
people imprisoned in a waterless
dungeon.
12 Come back to the Citadel, you
captives waiting in hope. Now is the
day announced when I shall grant you
twofold reparation.
13 For my bow is strung, Judah; I have
laid the arrow to it, Ephraim; I have
roused your sons, Zion, and made you
into a warrior's sword against the sons
of Javan.
14 The LORD will appear over them, and
his arrow will flash forth like lightning;
the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet
and advance with the storm-winds of the
south.
15 The LORD of Hosts will protect them;
they will prevail, trampling underfoot
the sling-stones; they will be roaring
drunk as if with wine, brimful as a bowl,
drenched like the corners of the altar.
16 On that day the LORD their God will
save them, his own people, like a flock.
For they are the precious stones in a
crown which sparkle all about his land.Zechariah 9.17–10.5
21
17 What wealth is theirs, what beauty!
Grain to strengthen young men, and new
wine for maidens!
1 Ask the LORD for rain at the
time of the spring rain, the LORD
who makes the storm-clouds, and he
will give the heavy rains and grass in the
fields for everyone;
2 for the household gods utter empty
promises; diviners see false signs, they
produce lies as dreams, and the comfort
they offer is illusory. So the people
are left to wander about like sheep in
distress for lack of a shepherd.
3 My anger burns against the shepherds,
and I shall punish the leaders of the
flock. The LORD of Hosts will care for his
flock, the people of Judah, and transform
them into his royal war-horses.
4 From Judah will come corner-stone
and tent-peg, the bow ready for battle,
and all the commanders.
5 Together they will be like warriors
trampling the muddy tracks of the
battlefield; they will fight because the
LORD is with them, and they will put to
rout even those on horseback.
10Zechariah 10.6–11
22
6 I shall give triumph to the house
of Judah and victory to the house of
Joseph; I shall restore them in my
compassion for them, and they will be
as though I had never cast them off;
for I am the LORD their God and I shall
answer them.
7 So the Ephraimites will be like
warriors, with hearts gladdened as if by
wine; their children will see and be glad;
their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.
8 I shall whistle to call them in, for I
have delivered them, and they will be as
many as they used to be.
9 Though dispersed among the nations,
yet in far-off lands they will remember
me; they will rear their children and
return.
10 I shall bring them home from Egypt
and gather them from Assyria; I shall
lead them into Gilead and Lebanon until
there is no more room for them.
11 They will pass through the sea of
Egypt and strike its waves; all the depths
of the Nile will become dry. The pride of
Assyria will be brought down, and the
sceptre of Egypt will be no more.Zechariah 10.12–11.6
23
12 But Israel's strength will be in the
LORD; they will march proudly in his
name. This is the word of the LORD.
1 Lebanon, throw open your gates
so that fire may devour your
cedars.
2 Wail, every pine tree, for the cedars
have fallen, the mighty trees are
ravaged. Wail, every oak of Bashan, for
the impenetrable forest is laid low.
3 Hark to the wailing of the shepherds!
Their rich pastures are ravaged. Hark
to the roar of the lions! Jordan's dense
thickets are ravaged.
4 These were the words of the LORD my
God: Be a shepherd to the flock destined
for slaughter.
5 Those who buy will slaughter them and
incur no guilt; those who sell will then
say, Praise the LORD, I have become
rich! Even their shepherds feel no pity
for them.
6 For I shall no longer have pity on the
land's inhabitants, says the LORD. I am
about to put everyone into the power of
his shepherd and his king, and when the
land is crushed I shall not rescue them
from their hands.
11Zechariah 11.7–13
24
7 So I became a shepherd to the flock
destined to be slaughtered by the
dealers. I took two staffs: one I called
Favour and the other Union, and so I
looked after the flock.
8 In a single month I got rid of the three
shepherds; I had lost patience with the
flock and they had come to abhor me.
9 Then I said to them, I shall not be
a shepherd to you any more. Any that
are to die, let them die; any that are
missing, let them stay missing; and the
rest can devour one another.
10 I took my staff called Favour and
snapped it in two, annulling the covenant
which the LORD had made with all
nations.
11 So it was annulled that day, and the
dealers who were watching me knew
that this was a word from the LORD.
12 I said to them, If it suits you, give me
my wages; otherwise keep them. Then
they weighed out my wages, thirty silver
pieces.
13 The LORD said to me, Throw it into
the treasury. I took the thirty pieces of
silver -- the princely sum at which I wasZechariah 11.14–12.2
25
paid off by them! -- and threw them into
the house of the LORD, into the treasury.
14 Then I broke in two my second staff
called Union, annulling the brotherhood
between Judah and Israel.
15 The LORD said to me, Equip yourself
again as a shepherd, a worthless one;
16 for I am about to install a shepherd
in the land who will neither care about
any that are gone missing, nor search
for those that have strayed, nor heal the
injured, nor nurse the sickly, but will eat
the flesh of the fat beasts and throw
away the broken bones.
17 Woe betide the worthless shepherd
who abandons the sheep! May a sword
fall on his arm and on his right eye! May
his arm be all shrivelled, and his right
eye be totally blind!
1 AN oracle. This is the word of
the LORD about Israel, the word
of the LORD who spread out the heavens
and founded the earth, and who formed
the spirit in mortals.
2 I am about to make Jerusalem an
intoxicating cup for all the nations
pressing round her; and Judah will be
caught up in the siege of Jerusalem.
12Zechariah 12.3–8
26
3 On that day, when all the nations of
the earth are gathered to attack her, I
shall make Jerusalem a rock too heavy
for any people to remove, and all who
try to carry it will be torn by it.
4 On that day, says the LORD, I shall
strike all their horses with panic and the
riders with madness; I shall keep watch
over Judah, while I strike with blindness
all the horses of the other nations.
5 Then the families of Judah will say
in their hearts, The inhabitants of
Jerusalem find their strength in the
LORD of Hosts, their God.
6 On that day I shall make the families of
Judah like a burning brazier in woodland,
like a burning torch among the sheaves.
They will consume all the surrounding
nations, right and left, while the people
of Jerusalem remain safe in their city.
7 The LORD will set free all the families
of Judah first, so that the glory of David's
line and of the citizens of Jerusalem may
not surpass that of Judah.
8 On that day the LORD will shield the
inhabitants of Jerusalem; on that day
the weakest of them will be like David,Zechariah 12.9–14
27
and the line of David godlike, like the
angel of the LORD going before them.
9 On that day I shall set about the
destruction of every nation that attacks
Jerusalem,
10 but I shall pour a spirit of pity and
compassion on the house of David and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Then they
will look on me, on him whom they have
pierced, and will lament over him as over
an only child, and will grieve for him
bitterly as for a firstborn son.
11 On that day the mourning in
Jerusalem will be as great as the
mourning over Hadad-rimmon in the
vale of Megiddo.
12 The land will mourn, each family by
itself: the family of David by itself and
its women by themselves; the family
of Nathan by itself and its women by
themselves;
13 the family of Levi by itself and its
women by themselves; the family of
Shimei by itself and its women by
themselves;
14 all the remaining families by
themselves and their women by
themselves.Zechariah 13.1–6
28
1 On that day a fountain will be
13 opened for the line of David and
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to
remove their sin and impurity.
2 On that day, says the LORD of
Hosts, I shall expunge the names of
the idols from the land, and they shall
be remembered no more; I shall also
expel the prophets and the spirit of
uncleanness from the land.
3 Thereafter, if anyone continues to
prophesy, his parents, his own father
and mother, will say to him, You are not
to remain alive, for you have uttered lies
in the LORD's name. His own father and
mother will run him through because he
has prophesied.
4 On that day every prophet will be
ashamed of his prophetic vision, and he
will not wear a robe of coarse hair in
order to deceive.
5 He will say, I am not a prophet, I am
a worker on the land, for the land has
been my possession from my early days.
6 If someone asks, What are these scars
on your chest? he will answer, I got them
in the house of my friends.Zechariah 13.7–14.2
29
7 This is the word of the LORD of Hosts:
Sword, awake against my shepherd,
against him who works with me. Strike
the shepherd, and the sheep will be
scattered, and I shall turn my hand
against the lambs.
8 This also is the word of the LORD: It
will happen throughout the land that two
thirds of the people will be struck down
and die, while one third of them will be
left there.
9 Then I shall pass this third through
the fire; I shall refine them as silver
is refined and assay them as gold is
assayed. They will invoke me by my
name, and I myself shall answer them; I
shall say, These are my people; they will
say, The LORD is my God.
1 A day is coming for the LORD to
act, and the plunder taken from
you will be shared out while you stand
by.
2 I shall gather all the nations to make
war on Jerusalem; the city will be taken,
the houses ransacked, and the women
raped. Half of the city will go into exile,
but the rest of the population will not be
taken away from the city.
14Zechariah 14.3–8
30
3 Then the LORD will go out and fight
against the nations, fighting as on a day
of battle.
4 On that day his feet will stand on the
mount of Olives, which lies to the east of
Jerusalem, and the mount will be cleft
in two by an immense valley running
east and west; half the mount will move
northwards and half southwards.
5 The valley between the hills will be
blocked, for the new valley between
them will reach as far as Asal. It will be
blocked as it was by the earthquake in
the time of King Uzziah of Judah. Then
the LORD my God will appear attended
by all the holy ones.
6 On that day there will be neither heat
nor cold nor frost.
7 It will be one continuous day, whose
coming is known only to the LORD; there
will be no distinction between day and
night; even in the evening there will be
light.
8 On that day, whether in summer or
in winter, running water will issue from
Jerusalem, half flowing to the eastern
sea and half to the western sea.Zechariah 14.9–14
31
9 The LORD will become king over all
the earth; on that day he will be the only
LORD and his name the only name.
10 The whole land will become like the
Arabah from Geba to Rimmon south of
Jerusalem. But Jerusalem will stand high
in her place, and be full of people from
the Benjamin Gate to the point where
the former gate stood, to the Corner
Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to
the king's winepresses.
11 Jerusalem will be inhabited, and
never again will a ban for her destruction
be laid on her; all will live there in
security.
12 The LORD will strike with this plague
all the nations who warred against
Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they
are still standing on their feet, their
eyes will rot in their sockets, and their
tongues will rot in their mouths.
13 On that day a great panic sent by the
LORD will fall on them, with everyone
laying hands on his neighbour and
attacking him.
14 Judah too will fight at Jerusalem, and
the wealth of the surrounding nationsZechariah 14.15– 20
32
will be gathered up -- gold and silver and
clothing in great quantities.
15 Plague will also be the fate of horse
and mule, camel and donkey, the fate of
every animal in those armies.
16 Any survivors among the nations
which fought against Jerusalem are to
go up year by year to worship the King,
the LORD of Hosts, and to keep the
pilgrim-feast of Tabernacles.
17 Should any of the families of the
earth not go up to Jerusalem to worship
the King, the LORD of Hosts, no rain will
fall on them.
18 If any family of Egypt does not go
up and enter the city, then the same
disaster will overtake it as that which
the LORD will inflict on any nation which
does not go up to keep the feast.
19 This will be the punishment which
befalls Egypt and any nation which
does not go up to keep the feast of
Tabernacles.
20 On that day Holy to the LORD will be
inscribed on the horses' bells, and the
pots in the house of the LORD will be like
the sacred bowls before the altar.Zechariah 14.21
33
21 Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will
be holy to the LORD of Hosts, and all
who come to sacrifice will use them for
boiling the flesh of the sacrifice. When
that time comes, no longer will any
trader be seen in the house of the LORD
of Hosts.Malachi
1 AN oracle. The word of the LORD to
1 Israel through Malachi.
2 I HAVE shown you love, says the
LORD. But you ask, How have you shown
love to us? Is not Esau Jacob's brother?
the LORD answers. Jacob I love,
3 but Esau I hate, and I have reduced
his hill-country to a waste, and his
ancestral land to desert pastures.
4 When Edom says, We are beaten
down, but let us rebuild our ruined
homes, these are the words of the LORD
of Hosts: If they rebuild, I shall pull
down. They will be called a country of
wickedness, a people with whom the
LORD is angry for ever.
5 Your own eyes will see it, and
you yourselves will say, The LORD's
greatness reaches beyond the confines
of Israel.
6 A son honours his father and a slave
his master. If I am a father, where is the
honour due to me? If I am a master,
where is the fear due to me? So saysMalachi 1.7–11
2
the LORD of Hosts to you, priests who
despise my name. You ask, How have
we despised your name?
7 By offering defiled food on my altar.
You ask, How have we defiled you? By
saying that the table of the LORD may
be despised,
8 that if you offer a blind victim, there is
nothing wrong, and if you offer a victim
which is lame or sickly, there is nothing
wrong. If you brought such a gift to your
governor, would he receive you or show
you favour? says the LORD of Hosts.
9 But now, if you placate God, he may
show you mercy! If you do this, will he
withhold his favour from you? So the
LORD of Hosts has spoken.
10 Better far that one of you should
close the great door altogether, to keep
fire from being lit on my altar to no
purpose! I have no pleasure in you, says
the LORD of Hosts, nor will I accept any
offering from you.
11 From farthest east to farthest west
my name is great among the nations,
and everywhere incense and pure
offerings are presented to my name; forMalachi 1.12–2.3
3
my name is great among the nations,
says the LORD of Hosts.
12 But you profane me by thinking that
the table of the LORD may be defiled,
and you can offer on it food that you
hold in no esteem.
13 You sniff scornfully at it, says the
LORD of Hosts, and exclaim, How
tiresome! If you bring as your offering
victims that are mutilated, lame, or
sickly, am I to accept them from you?
says the LORD.
14 A curse on the cheat who pays his
vows by sacrificing a damaged victim to
the Lord, though he has a sound ram
in his flock! I am a great king, says the
LORD of Hosts, and my name is held in
awe among the nations.
1 And now, you priests, this decree is
for you:
2 unless you listen to me and pay heed
to the honouring of my name, says the
LORD of Hosts, I shall lay a curse on
you. I shall turn your blessings into a
curse; yes, into a curse, because you
pay no heed.
3 I shall cut off your arms, fling offal
in your faces, the offal from your
2Malachi 2.4–9
4
pilgrim-feasts, and I shall banish you
from my presence.
4 Then you will know that I have issued
this decree against you: my covenant
with Levi falls, says the LORD of Hosts.
5 My covenant was with him: I bestowed
life and welfare on him, and laid on him
the duty of reverence; he revered me
and lived in awe of my name.
6 The instruction he gave was true, and
no word of injustice fell from his lips;
he walked in harmony with me and in
uprightness, and he turned many back
from sin.
7 For men hang on the words of
the priest and seek knowledge and
instruction from him, because he is the
messenger of the LORD of Hosts.
8 But you have turned aside from
that course; you have caused many to
stumble with your instruction; you have
set at naught the covenant with the
Levites, says the LORD of Hosts.
9 So I in my turn shall make you
despicable and degraded in the eyes
of all the people, inasmuch as you
disregard my ways and show partiality in
your interpretation of the law.Malachi 2.10–15
5
10 Have we not all one father? Did not
one God create us? Why then are we
faithless to one another by violating the
covenant of our forefathers?
11 Judah is faithless, and abominable
things are done in Israel and in
Jerusalem; in marrying the daughter of
a foreign god, Judah has violated the
sacred place loved by the LORD.
12 May the LORD banish from the
dwellings of Jacob any who do this,
whether nomads or settlers, even though
they bring offerings to the LORD of
Hosts.
13 Here is another thing you do: you
weep and moan, drowning the LORD's
altar with tears, but he still refuses to
look at the offering or receive favourably
a gift from you.
14 You ask why. It is because the LORD
has borne witness against you on behalf
of the wife of your youth. You have
broken faith with her, though she is your
partner, your wife by solemn covenant.
15 Did not the one God make her, both
flesh and spirit? And what does the one
God require but godly children? KeepMalachi 2.16–3.3
6
watch on your spirit, and let none of you
be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.
16 If a man divorces or puts away his
wife, says the LORD God of Israel, he
overwhelms her with cruelty, says the
LORD of Hosts. Keep watch on your
spirit, and do not be unfaithful.
17 You have wearied the LORD with your
talk. You ask, How have we wearied him?
By saying that all evildoers are good in
the eyes of the LORD, that he is pleased
with them, or by asking, Where is the
God of justice?
1 I am about to send my messenger
to clear a path before me. Suddenly
the Lord whom you seek will come
to his temple; the messenger of the
covenant in whom you delight is here,
here already, says the LORD of Hosts.
2 Who can endure the day of his
coming? Who can stand firm when he
appears? He is like a refiner's fire, like a
fuller's soap;
3 he will take his seat, testing and
purifying; he will purify the Levites and
refine them like gold and silver, and so
they will be fit to bring offerings to the
LORD.
3Malachi 3.4–10
7
4 Thus the offerings of Judah and
Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD
as they were in former days, in years
long past.
5 I shall appear before you in court,
quick to testify against sorcerers,
adulterers, and perjurers, against those
who cheat the hired labourer of his
wages, who wrong the widow and the
fatherless, who thrust the alien aside
and do not fear me, says the LORD of
Hosts.
6 I, the LORD, do not change, and you
have not ceased to be children of Jacob.
7 Ever since the days of your forefathers
you have been wayward and have not
kept my laws. If you return to me, I
shall turn back to you, says the LORD of
Hosts. You ask, How can we return?
8 Can a human being defraud God? Yet
you defraud me. You ask, How have we
defrauded you? Why, over tithes and
contributions.
9 There is a curse on you all, your entire
nation, because you defraud me.
10 Bring the whole tithe into the
treasury; let there be food in my house.
Put me to the proof, says the LORD ofMalachi 3.11–17
8
Hosts, and see if I do not open windows
in the sky and pour a blessing on you as
long as there is need.
11 I shall forbid pests to destroy the
produce of your soil, and your vines will
not shed their fruit, says the LORD of
Hosts.
12 All nations will count you happy, for
yours will be a favoured land, says the
LORD of Hosts.
13 YOU HAVE used hard words about
me, says the LORD. Yet you ask, How
have we spoken against you?
14 You have said, To serve God is futile.
What do we gain from the LORD of Hosts
by observing his rules and behaving with
humble submission?
15 We for our part count the arrogant
happy; it is evildoers who prosper; they
have put God to the proof and come to
no harm.
16 Then those who feared the LORD
talked together, and the LORD paid heed
and listened. A record was written before
him of those who feared him and had
respect for his name.
17 They will be mine, says the LORD of
Hosts, my own possession against theMalachi 3.18–4.6
9
day that I appoint, and I shall spare
them as a man spares the son who
serves him.
18 Once more you will tell the good from
the wicked, the servant of God from the
person who does not serve him.
1 The day comes, burning like a
furnace; all the arrogant and all
evildoers will be stubble, and that day
when it comes will set them ablaze,
leaving them neither root nor branch,
says the LORD of Hosts.
2 But for you who fear my name, the sun
of righteousness will rise with healing in
its wings, and you will break loose like
calves released from the stall.
3 On the day I take action, you will
tread down the wicked, for they will be
as ashes under the soles of your feet,
says the LORD of Hosts.
4 Remember the law of Moses my
servant, the rules and precepts which I
told him to deliver to all Israel at Horeb.
5 Look, I shall send you the prophet
Elijah before the great and terrible day
of the LORD comes.
6 He will reconcile parents to their
children and children to their parents,

lest I come and put the land under a ban
to destroy it.Matthew
1 THE genealogy of Jesus Christ, son
1 of David, son of Abraham.
2 Abraham was the father of Isaac,
Isaac of Jacob, Jacob of Judah and his
brothers,
3 Judah of Perez and Zarah (their
mother was Tamar), Perez of Hezron,
Hezron of Ram,
4 Ram of Amminadab, Amminadab of
Nahshon, Nahshon of Salmon,
5 Salmon of Boaz (his mother was
Rahab), Boaz of Obed (his mother was
Ruth), Obed of Jesse;
6 and Jesse was the father of King
David. David was the father of Solomon
(his mother had been the wife of Uriah),
7 Solomon of Rehoboam, Rehoboam of
Abijah, Abijah of Asa,
8 Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of
Joram, Joram of Uzziah,
9 Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz,
Ahaz of Hezekiah,
10 Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of
Amon, Amon of Josiah;Matthew 1.11–19
2
11 and Josiah was the father of Jeconiah
and his brothers at the time of the
deportation to Babylon.
12 After the deportation Jeconiah was
the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel of
Zerubbabel,
13 Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of
Eliakim, Eliakim of Azor,
14 Azor of Zadok, Zadok of Achim,
Achim of Eliud,
15 Eliud of Eleazar, Eleazar of Matthan,
Matthan of Jacob,
16 Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary,
who gave birth to Jesus called Messiah.
17 There were thus fourteen generations
in all from Abraham to David, fourteen
from David until the deportation
to Babylon, and fourteen from the
deportation until the Messiah.
18 THIS is how the birth of Jesus
Christ came about. His mother Mary
was betrothed to Joseph; before their
marriage she found she was going to
have a child through the Holy Spirit.
19 Being a man of principle, and at the
same time wanting to save her from
exposure, Joseph made up his mind toMatthew 1.20–2.1
3
have the marriage contract quietly set
aside.
20 He had resolved on this, when an
angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
dream and said, Joseph, son of David,
do not be afraid to take Mary home with
you to be your wife. It is through the
Holy Spirit that she has conceived.
21 She will bear a son; and you shall
give him the name Jesus, for he will save
his people from their sins.
22 All this happened in order to fulfil
what the Lord declared through the
prophet:
23 A virgin will conceive and bear a
son, and he shall be called Emmanuel, a
name which means God is with us.
24 When he woke Joseph did as the
angel of the Lord had directed him; he
took Mary home to be his wife,
25 but had no intercourse with her until
her son was born. And he named the
child Jesus.
1 JESUS was born at Bethlehem in
Judaea during the reign of Herod.
After his birth astrologers from the east
arrived in Jerusalem,
2Matthew 2.2–9
4
2 asking, Where is the new-born king
of the Jews? We observed the rising of
his star, and we have come to pay him
homage.
3 King Herod was greatly perturbed
when he heard this, and so was the
whole of Jerusalem.
4 He called together the chief priests
and scribes of the Jews, and asked them
where the Messiah was to be born.
5 At Bethlehem in Judaea, they replied,
for this is what the prophet wrote:
6 Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you
are by no means least among the rulers
of Judah; for out of you shall come a
ruler to be the shepherd of my people
Israel.
7 Then Herod summoned the astrologers
to meet him secretly, and ascertained
from them the exact time when the star
had appeared.
8 He sent them to Bethlehem, and said,
Go and make a careful search for the
child, and when you have found him,
bring me word, so that I may go myself
and pay him homage.
9 After hearing what the king had to say
they set out; there before them was theMatthew 2.10–15
5
star they had seen rising, and it went
ahead of them until it stopped above
the place where the child lay. They were
overjoyed at the sight of it
10 (2:9)
11 and, entering the house, they saw the
child with Mary his mother and bowed
low in homage to him; they opened their
treasure chests and presented gifts to
him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
12 Then they returned to their own
country by another route, for they had
been warned in a dream not to go back
to Herod.
13 After they had gone, an angel of the
Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
and said, Get up, take the child and his
mother and escape with them to Egypt,
and stay there until I tell you; for Herod
is going to search for the child to kill
him.
14 So Joseph got up, took mother and
child by night, and sought refuge with
them in Egypt,
15 where he stayed till Herod's death.
This was to fulfil what the Lord had
declared through the prophet: Out of
Egypt I have called my son.Matthew 2.16–22
6
16 When Herod realized that the
astrologers had tricked him he flew into
a rage, and gave orders for the massacre
of all the boys aged two years or under,
in Bethlehem and throughout the whole
district, in accordance with the time he
had ascertained from the astrologers.
17 So the words spoken through
Jeremiah the prophet were fulfilled:
18 A voice was heard in Rama, sobbing
in bitter grief; it was Rachel weeping
for her children, and refusing to be
comforted, because they were no more.
19 After Herod's death an angel of the
Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in
Egypt
20 and said to him, Get up, take the
child and his mother, and go to the land
of Israel, for those who threatened the
child's life are dead.
21 So he got up, took mother and child
with him, and came to the land of Israel.
22 But when he heard that Archelaus
had succeeded his father Herod as king
of Judaea, he was afraid to go there.
Directed by a dream, he withdrew to the
region of Galilee,Matthew 2.23–3.7
7
23 where he settled in a town called
Nazareth. This was to fulfil the words
spoken through the prophets: He shall
be called a Nazarene.
1 IN the course of time John the
Baptist appeared in the Judaean
wilderness, proclaiming this message:
2 Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is
upon you!
3 It was of him that the prophet Isaiah
spoke when he said, A voice cries in
the wilderness, Prepare the way for the
Lord; clear a straight path for him.
4 John's clothing was a rough coat of
camel's hair, with a leather belt round
his waist, and his food was locusts and
wild honey.
5 Everyone flocked to him from
Jerusalem, Judaea, and the Jordan
valley,
6 and they were baptized by him in the
river Jordan, confessing their sins.
7 When he saw many of the Pharisees
and Sadducees coming for baptism he
said to them: Vipers brood! Who warned
you to escape from the wrath that is to
come?
3Matthew 3.8–14
8
8 Prove your repentance by the fruit you
bear;
9 and do not imagine you can say, We
have Abraham for our father. I tell you
that God can make children for Abraham
out of these stones.
10 The axe lies ready at the roots of the
trees; every tree that fails to produce
good fruit is cut down and thrown on the
fire.
11 I baptize you with water, for
repentance; but the one who comes
after me is mightier than I am, whose
sandals I am not worthy to remove. He
will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
with fire.
12 His winnowing-shovel is ready in his
hand and he will clear his threshing-floor;
he will gather the wheat into his granary,
but the chaff he will burn on a fire that
can never be put out.'
13 Then Jesus arrived at the Jordan from
Galilee, and came to John to be baptized
by him.
14 John tried to dissuade him. Do you
come to me? he said. It is I who need to
be baptized by you.Matthew 3.15–4.5
9
15 Jesus replied, Let it be so for the
present; it is right for us to do all that
God requires. Then John allowed him to
come.
16 No sooner had Jesus been baptized
and come up out of the water than the
heavens were opened and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove to
alight on him.
17 And there came a voice from heaven
saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom
I take delight.
1 JESUS was then led by the Spirit
into the wilderness, to be tempted
by the devil.
2 For forty days and nights he fasted,
and at the end of them he was famished.
3 The tempter approached him and said,
If you are the Son of God, tell these
stones to become bread.
4 Jesus answered, Scripture says, Man
is not to live on bread alone, but on
every word that comes from the mouth
of God.
5 The devil then took him to the Holy
City and set him on the parapet of the
temple.
4Matthew 4.6–14
10
6 If you are the Son of God, he said,
throw yourself down; for scripture says,
He will put his angels in charge of you,
and they will support you in their arms,
for fear you should strike your foot
against a stone.
7 Jesus answered him, Scripture also
says, You are not to put the Lord your
God to the test.
8 The devil took him next to a very
high mountain, and showed him all the
kingdoms of the world in their glory.
9 All these, he said, I will give you, if you
will only fall down and do me homage.
10 But Jesus said, Out of my sight,
Satan! Scripture says, You shall do
homage to the Lord your God and
worship him alone.
11 Then the devil left him; and angels
came and attended to his needs.
12 WHEN he heard that John had been
arrested, Jesus withdrew to Galilee;
13 and leaving Nazareth he went and
settled at Capernaum on the sea of
Galilee, in the district of Zebulun and
Naphtali.
14 This was to fulfil the words of the
prophet Isaiah aboutMatthew 4.15–23
11
15 the land of Zebulun, the land of
Naphtali, the road to the sea, the land
beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
16 The people that lived in darkness
have seen a great light; light has dawned
on those who lived in the land of death's
dark shadow.
17 From that day Jesus began to
proclaim the message: Repent, for the
kingdom of Heaven is upon you.
18 JESUS was walking by the sea of
Galilee when he saw two brothers, Simon
called Peter and his brother Andrew,
casting a net into the lake; for they were
fishermen.
19 Jesus said to them, Come with me,
and I will make you fishers of men.
20 At once they left their nets and
followed him.
21 Going on farther, he saw another pair
of brothers, James son of Zebedee and
his brother John; they were in a boat
with their father Zebedee, mending their
nets. He called them,
22 and at once they left the boat and
their father, and followed him.
23 He travelled throughout Galilee,
teaching in the synagogues, proclaimingMatthew 4.24–5.6
12
the good news of the kingdom, and
healing every kind of illness and infirmity
among the people.
24 His fame spread throughout Syria;
and they brought to him sufferers from
various diseases, those racked with
pain or possessed by demons, those
who were epileptic or paralysed, and he
healed them all.
25 Large crowds followed him, from
Galilee and the Decapolis, from
Jerusalem and Judaea, and from
Transjordan.
1 WHEN he saw the crowds he went
up a mountain. There he sat down,
and when his disciples had gathered
round him
2 he began to address them. And this is
the teaching he gave:
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit; the
kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
4 Blessed are the sorrowful; they shall
find consolation.
5 Blessed are the gentle; they shall have
the earth for their possession.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst to see right prevail; they shall be
satisfied.
5Matthew 5.7–16
13
7 Blessed are those who show mercy;
mercy shall be shown to them.
8 Blessed are those whose hearts are
pure; they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers; they
shall be called God's children.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted
in the cause of right; the kingdom of
Heaven is theirs.
11 Blessed are you, when you suffer
insults and persecution and calumnies of
every kind for my sake.
12 Exult and be glad, for you have a rich
reward in heaven; in the same way they
persecuted the prophets before you.
13 You are salt to the world. And if salt
becomes tasteless, how is its saltness to
be restored? It is good for nothing but to
be thrown away and trodden underfoot.
14 You are light for all the world. A town
that stands on a hill cannot be hidden.
15 When a lamp is lit, it is not put under
the meal-tub, but on the lampstand,
where it gives light to everyone in the
house.
16 Like the lamp, you must shed light
among your fellows, so that, when theyMatthew 5.17–22
14
see the good you do, they may give
praise to your Father in heaven.
17 DO NOT suppose that I have come to
abolish the law and the prophets; I did
not come to abolish, but to complete.
18 Truly I tell you: so long as heaven
and earth endure, not a letter, not a dot,
will disappear from the law until all that
must happen has happened.
19 Anyone therefore who sets aside
even the least of the law's demands,
and teaches others to do the same, will
have the lowest place in the kingdom of
Heaven, whereas anyone who keeps the
law, and teaches others to do so, will
rank high in the kingdom of Heaven.
20 I tell you, unless you show yourselves
far better than the scribes and Pharisees,
you can never enter the kingdom of
Heaven.
21 You have heard that our forefathers
were told, Do not commit murder;
anyone who commits murder must be
brought to justice.
22 But what I tell you is this: Anyone
who nurses anger against his brother
must be brought to justice. Whoever
calls his brother good for nothingMatthew 5.23–29
15
deserves the sentence of the court;
whoever calls him fool deserves hell-fire.
23 So if you are presenting your gift at
the altar and suddenly remember that
your brother has a grievance against
you,
24 leave your gift where it is before the
altar. First go and make your peace with
your brother; then come back and offer
your gift.
25 If someone sues you, come to terms
with him promptly while you are both
on your way to court; otherwise he
may hand you over to the judge, and
the judge to the officer, and you will be
thrown into jail.
26 Truly I tell you: once you are there
you will not be let out until you have
paid the last penny.
27 You have heard that they were told,
Do not commit adultery.
28 But what I tell you is this: If a man
looks at a woman with a lustful eye, he
has already committed adultery with her
in his heart.
29 If your right eye causes your
downfall, tear it out and fling it away;
it is better for you to lose one part ofMatthew 5.30–36
16
your body than for the whole of it to be
thrown into hell.
30 If your right hand causes your
downfall, cut it off and fling it away; it is
better for you to lose one part of your
body than for the whole of it to go to
hell.
31 They were told, A man who divorces
his wife must give her a certificate of
dismissal.
32 But what I tell you is this: If a
man divorces his wife for any cause
other than unchastity he involves her
in adultery; and whoever marries her
commits adultery.
33 Again, you have heard that our
forefathers were told, Do not break your
oath, and Oaths sworn to the Lord must
be kept.
34 But what I tell you is this: You are
not to swear at all -- not by heaven, for
it is God's throne,
35 nor by the earth, for it is his footstool,
nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
great King,
36 nor by your own head, because you
cannot turn one hair of it white or black.Matthew 5.37–45
17
37 Plain Yes or No is all you need to say;
anything beyond that comes from the
evil one.
38 You have heard that they were told,
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
39 But what I tell you is this: Do not
resist those who wrong you. If anyone
slaps you on the right cheek, turn and
offer him the other also.
40 If anyone wants to sue you and takes
your shirt, let him have your cloak as
well.
41 If someone in authority presses you
into service for one mile, go with him
two.
42 Give to anyone who asks; and do not
turn your back on anyone who wants to
borrow.
43 You have heard that they were told,
Love your neighbour and hate your
enemy.
44 But what I tell you is this: Love your
enemies and pray for your persecutors;
45 only so can you be children of your
heavenly Father, who causes the sun to
rise on good and bad alike, and sends
the rain on the innocent and the wicked.Matthew 5.46–6.5
18
46 If you love only those who love you,
what reward can you expect? Even the
tax-collectors do as much as that.
47 If you greet only your brothers, what
is there extraordinary about that? Even
the heathen do as much.
48 There must be no limit to your
goodness, as your heavenly Father's
goodness knows no bounds.
1 BE careful not to parade your
religion before others; if you do, no
reward awaits you with your Father in
heaven.
2 So, when you give alms, do not
announce it with a flourish of trumpets,
as the hypocrites do in synagogues and
in the streets to win the praise of others.
Truly I tell you: they have their reward
already.
3 But when you give alms, do not let
your left hand know what your right is
doing;
4 your good deed must be secret, and
your Father who sees what is done in
secret will reward you.
5 Again, when you pray, do not be like
the hypocrites; they love to say their
prayers standing up in synagogues and
6Matthew 6.6–13
19
at street corners for everyone to see
them. Truly I tell you: they have their
reward already.
6 But when you pray, go into a room
by yourself, shut the door, and pray to
your Father who is in secret; and your
Father who sees what is done in secret
will reward you.
7 In your prayers do not go babbling on
like the heathen, who imagine that the
more they say the more likely they are
to be heard.
8 Do not imitate them, for your Father
knows what your needs are before you
ask him.
9 This is how you should pray: Our
Father in heaven, may your name be
hallowed;
10 your kingdom come, your will be
done, on earth as in heaven.
11 Give us today our daily bread.
12 Forgive us the wrong we have done,
as we have forgiven those who have
wronged us.
13 And do not put us to the test, but
save us from the evil one.Matthew 6.14–22
20
14 For if you forgive others the wrongs
they have done, your heavenly Father
will also forgive you;
15 but if you do not forgive others, then
your Father will not forgive the wrongs
that you have done.
16 So too when you fast, do not look
gloomy like the hypocrites: they make
their faces unsightly so that everybody
may see that they are fasting. Truly I tell
you: they have their reward already.
17 But when you fast, anoint your head
and wash your face,
18 so that no one sees that you are
fasting, but only your Father who is in
secret; and your Father who sees what is
done in secret will give you your reward.
19 DO NOT store up for yourselves
treasure on earth, where moth and rust
destroy, and thieves break in and steal;
20 but store up treasure in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust will destroy,
nor thieves break in and steal.
21 For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.
22 The lamp of the body is the eye. If
your eyes are sound, you will have light
for your whole body;Matthew 6.23–30
21
23 if your eyes are bad, your whole
body will be in darkness. If then the only
light you have is darkness, how great a
darkness that will be.
24 No one can serve two masters; for
either he will hate the first and love the
second, or he will be devoted to the
first and despise the second. You cannot
serve God and Money.
25 This is why I tell you not to be
anxious about food and drink to keep
you alive and about clothes to cover your
body. Surely life is more than food, the
body more than clothes.
26 Look at the birds in the sky; they do
not sow and reap and store in barns, yet
your heavenly Father feeds them. Are
you not worth more than the birds?
27 Can anxious thought add a single day
to your life?
28 And why be anxious about clothes?
Consider how the lilies grow in the fields;
they do not work, they do not spin;
29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all
his splendour was not attired like one of
them.
30 If that is how God clothes the grass
in the fields, which is there today andMatthew 6.31–7.4
22
tomorrow is thrown on the stove, will he
not all the more clothe you? How little
faith you have!
31 Do not ask anxiously, What are we to
eat? What are we to drink? What shall
we wear?
32 These are the things that occupy the
minds of the heathen, but your heavenly
Father knows that you need them all.
33 Set your mind on God's kingdom and
his justice before everything else, and all
the rest will come to you as well.
34 So do not be anxious about
tomorrow; tomorrow will look after itself.
Each day has troubles enough of its own.
1 DO NOT judge, and you will not be
judged.
2 For as you judge others, so you will
yourselves be judged, and whatever
measure you deal out to others will be
dealt to you.
3 Why do you look at the speck of
sawdust in your brother's eye, with
never a thought for the plank in your
own?
4 How can you say to your brother, Let
me take the speck out of your eye, when
all the time there is a plank in your own?
7Matthew 7.5–13
23
5 You hypocrite! First take the plank
out of your own eye, and then you will
see clearly to take the speck out of your
brother's.
6 Do not give dogs what is holy; do not
throw your pearls to the pigs: they will
only trample on them, and turn and tear
you to pieces.
7 Ask, and you will receive; seek, and
you will find; knock, and the door will be
opened to you.
8 For everyone who asks receives, those
who seek find, and to those who knock,
the door will be opened.
9 Would any of you offer his son a stone
when he asks for bread,
10 or a snake when he asks for a fish?
11 If you, bad as you are, know how to
give good things to your children, how
much more will your heavenly Father
give good things to those who ask him!
12 Always treat others as you would like
them to treat you: that is the law and
the prophets.
13 Enter by the narrow gate. Wide is the
gate and broad the road that leads to
destruction, and many enter that way;Matthew 7.14–22
24
14 narrow is the gate and constricted
the road that leads to life, and those who
find them are few.
15 Beware of false prophets, who come
to you dressed up as sheep while
underneath they are savage wolves.
16 You will recognize them by their fruit.
Can grapes be picked from briars, or figs
from thistles?
17 A good tree always yields sound fruit,
and a poor tree bad fruit.
18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, or
a poor tree sound fruit.
19 A tree that does not yield sound fruit
is cut down and thrown on the fire.
20 That is why I say you will recognize
them by their fruit.
21 Not everyone who says to me, Lord,
Lord will enter the kingdom of Heaven,
but only those who do the will of my
heavenly Father.
22 When the day comes, many will say
to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy
in your name, drive out demons in your
name, and in your name perform many
miracles?Matthew 7.23–8.2
25
23 Then I will tell them plainly, I never
knew you. Out of my sight; your deeds
are evil!
24 So whoever hears these words of
mine and acts on them is like a man who
had the sense to build his house on rock.
25 The rain came down, the floods rose,
the winds blew and beat upon that
house; but it did not fall, because its
foundations were on rock.
26 And whoever hears these words of
mine and does not act on them is like a
man who was foolish enough to build his
house on sand.
27 The rain came down, the floods rose,
the winds blew and battered against that
house; and it fell with a great crash.
28 When Jesus had finished this
discourse the people were amazed at his
teaching;
29 unlike their scribes he taught with a
note of authority.
1 WHEN he came down from the
mountain great crowds followed him.
2 And now a leper approached him,
bowed before him, and said, Sir, if only
you will, you can make me clean.
8Matthew 8.3–11
26
3 Jesus stretched out his hand and
touched him, saying, I will; be clean.
And his leprosy was cured immediately.
4 Then Jesus said to him, See that you
tell nobody; but go and show yourself
to the priest, and make the offering laid
down by Moses to certify the cure.
5 As Jesus entered Capernaum a
centurion came up to ask his help.
6 Sir, he said, my servant is lying at
home paralysed and racked with pain.
7 Jesus said, I will come and cure him.
8 But the centurion replied, Sir, I am not
worthy to have you under my roof. You
need only say the word and my servant
will be cured.
9 I know, for I am myself under orders,
with soldiers under me. I say to one, Go,
and he goes; to another, Come here, and
he comes; and to my servant, Do this,
and he does it.
10 Jesus heard him with astonishment,
and said to the people who were
following him, Truly I tell you: nowhere
in Israel have I found such faith.
11 Many, I tell you, will come from east
and west to sit with Abraham, Isaac, andMatthew 8.12–19
27
Jacob at the banquet in the kingdom of
Heaven.
12 But those who were born to the
kingdom will be thrown out into the dark,
where there will be wailing and grinding
of teeth.
13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go
home; as you have believed, so let it be.
At that very moment the boy recovered.
14 Jesus then went to Peter's house and
found Peter's mother-in-law in bed with
fever.
15 So he took her by the hand; the fever
left her, and she got up and attended to
his needs.
16 That evening they brought to him
many who were possessed by demons;
and he drove the spirits out with a word
and healed all who were sick,
17 to fulfil the prophecy of Isaiah: He
took our illnesses from us and carried
away our diseases.
18 AT the sight of the crowd surrounding
him Jesus gave word to cross to the
other side of the lake.
19 A scribe came up and said to him,
Teacher, I will follow you wherever you
go.Matthew 8.20–28
28
20 Jesus replied, Foxes have their holes
and birds their roosts; but the Son of
Man has nowhere to lay his head.
21 Another man, one of his disciples,
said to him, Lord, let me go and bury my
father first.
22 Jesus replied, Follow me, and leave
the dead to bury their dead.
23 Jesus then got into the boat, and his
disciples followed.
24 All at once a great storm arose on the
lake, till the waves were breaking right
over the boat; but he went on sleeping.
25 So they came and woke him, saying:
Save us, Lord; we are sinking!
26 Why are you such cowards? he said.
How little faith you have! With that he
got up and rebuked the wind and the
sea, and there was a dead calm.
27 The men were astonished at what
had happened, and exclaimed, What sort
of man is this? Even the wind and the
sea obey him.
28 When he reached the country of
the Gadarenes on the other side, two
men came to meet him from among the
tombs; they were possessed by demons,Matthew 8.29–9.2
29
and so violent that no one dared pass
that way.
29 Son of God, they shouted, what do
you want with us? Have you come here
to torment us before our time?
30 In the distance a large herd of pigs
was feeding;
31 and the demons begged him: If you
drive us out, send us into that herd of
pigs.
32 Go! he said. Then they came out and
went into the pigs, and the whole herd
rushed over the edge into the lake, and
perished in the water.
33 The men in charge of them took to
their heels, and made for the town,
where they told the whole story, and
what had happened to the madmen.
34 Then the whole town came out to
meet Jesus; and when they saw him
they begged him to leave the district.
1 So he got into the boat and crossed
over, and came to his own town.
2 Some men appeared, bringing to
Jesus a paralysed man on a bed. When
he saw their faith Jesus said to the
man, Take heart, my son; your sins are
forgiven.
9Matthew 9.3–12
30
3 At this some of the scribes said to
themselves, This man is blaspheming!
4 Jesus realized what they were
thinking, and said, Why do you harbour
evil thoughts?
5 Is it easier to say, Your sins are
forgiven, or to say, Stand up and walk?
6 But to convince you that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins -- he turned to the paralysed man --
stand up, take your bed, and go home.
7 And he got up and went off home.
8 The people were filled with awe at the
sight, and praised God for granting such
authority to men.
9 AS HE went on from there Jesus saw
a man named Matthew at his seat in the
custom-house, and said to him, Follow
me; and Matthew rose and followed him.
10 When Jesus was having a meal in the
house, many tax-collectors and sinners
were seated with him and his disciples.
11 Noticing this, the Pharisees said to
his disciples, Why is it that your teacher
eats with tax-collectors and sinners?
12 Hearing this he said, It is not the
healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.Matthew 9.13–19
31
13 Go and learn what this text means,
I require mercy, not sacrifice. I did not
come to call the virtuous, but sinners.
14 Then John's disciples came to him
with the question: Why is it that we and
the Pharisees fast but your disciples do
not?
15 Jesus replied, Can you expect the
bridegroom's friends to be sad while the
bridegroom is with them? The time will
come when the bridegroom will be taken
away from them; then they will fast.
16 No one puts a patch of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment; for then the
patch tears away from the garment, and
leaves a bigger hole.
17 Nor do people put new wine into old
wineskins; if they do, the skins burst,
and then the wine runs out and the skins
are ruined. No, they put new wine into
fresh skins; then both are preserved.
18 EVEN as he spoke, an official came
up, who bowed before him and said, My
daughter has just died; but come and
lay your hand on her, and she will live.
19 Jesus rose and went with him, and so
did his disciples.Matthew 9.20–28
32
20 Just then a woman who had suffered
from haemorrhages for twelve years
came up from behind, and touched the
edge of his cloak;
21 for she said to herself, If I can only
touch his cloak, I shall be healed.
22 But Jesus turned and saw her, and
said, Take heart, my daughter; your faith
has healed you. And from that moment
she recovered.
23 When Jesus arrived at the official's
house and saw the flute-players and the
general commotion,
24 he said, Go away! The girl is not
dead: she is asleep; and they laughed at
him.
25 After turning them all out, he went
into the room and took the girl by the
hand, and she got up.
26 The story became the talk of the
whole district.
27 As he went on from there Jesus was
followed by two blind men, shouting,
Have pity on us, Son of David!
28 When he had gone indoors they came
to him, and Jesus asked, Do you believe
that I have the power to do what you
want? We do, they said.Matthew 9.29–38
33
29 Then he touched their eyes, and said,
As you have believed, so let it be;
30 and their sight was restored. Jesus
said to them sternly, See that no one
hears about this.
31 But as soon as they had gone out
they talked about him all over the region.
32 They were on their way out when a
man was brought to him, who was dumb
and possessed by a demon;
33 the demon was driven out and
the dumb man spoke. The crowd was
astonished and said, Nothing like this
has ever been seen in Israel.
34 [[EMPTY]]
35 SO JESUS went round all the
towns and villages teaching in their
synagogues, proclaiming the good news
of the kingdom, and curing every kind of
illness and infirmity.
36 The sight of the crowds moved him
to pity: they were like sheep without a
shepherd, harassed and helpless.
37 Then he said to his disciples, The
crop is heavy, but the labourers too few;
38 you must ask the owner to send
labourers to bring in the harvest.Matthew 10.1–9
34
1 THEN he called his twelve
10 disciples to him and gave them
authority to drive out unclean spirits and
to cure every kind of illness and infirmity.
2 These are the names of the twelve
apostles: first Simon, also called Peter,
and his brother Andrew; James son of
Zebedee, and his brother John;
3 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and
Matthew the tax-collector, James son of
Alphaeus, Thaddaeus,
4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,
the man who betrayed him.
5 These twelve Jesus sent out with the
following instructions: Do not take the
road to gentile lands, and do not enter
any Samaritan town;
6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.
7 And as you go proclaim the message:
The kingdom of Heaven is upon you.
8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
lepers, drive out demons. You received
without cost; give without charge.
9 Take no gold, silver, or copper in your
belts,Matthew 10.10–18
35
10 no pack for the road, no second
coat, no sandals, no stick; the worker
deserves his keep.
11 Whatever town or village you enter,
look for some suitable person in it, and
stay with him until you leave.
12 Wish the house peace as you enter it;
13 if it is welcoming, let your peace
descend on it, and if it is not, let your
peace come back to you.
14 If anyone will not receive you or
listen to what you say, then as you leave
that house or that town shake the dust
of it off your feet.
15 Truly I tell you: on the day of
judgement it will be more bearable for
the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than
for that town.
16 I send you out like sheep among
wolves; be wary as serpents, innocent
as doves.
17 Be on your guard, for you will be
handed over to the courts, they will flog
you in their synagogues,
18 and you will be brought before
governors and kings on my account, to
testify before them and the Gentiles.Matthew 10.19–26
36
19 But when you are arrested, do not
worry about what you are to say, for
when the time comes, the words you
need will be given you;
20 it will not be you speaking, but the
Spirit of your Father speaking in you.
21 Brother will hand over brother to
death, and a father his child; children
will turn against their parents and send
them to their death.
22 Everyone will hate you for your
allegiance to me, but whoever endures
to the end will be saved.
23 When you are persecuted in one
town, take refuge in another; truly I tell
you: before you have gone through all
the towns of Israel the Son of Man will
have come.
24 No pupil ranks above his teacher, no
servant above his master.
25 The pupil should be content to share
his teacher's lot, the servant to share
his master's. If the master has been
called Beelzebul, how much more his
household!
26 So do not be afraid of them. There
is nothing covered up that will not beMatthew 10.27–34
37
uncovered, nothing hidden that will not
be made known.
27 What I say to you in the dark you
must repeat in broad daylight; what you
hear whispered you must shout from the
housetops.
28 Do not fear those who kill the body,
but cannot kill the soul. Fear him rather
who is able to destroy both soul and
body in hell.
29 Are not two sparrows sold for
a penny? Yet without your Father's
knowledge not one of them can fall to
the ground.
30 As for you, even the hairs of your
head have all been counted.
31 So do not be afraid; you are worth
more than any number of sparrows.
32 Whoever will acknowledge me before
others, I will acknowledge before my
Father in heaven;
33 and whoever disowns me before
others, I will disown before my Father in
heaven.
34 You must not think that I have come
to bring peace to the earth; I have not
come to bring peace, but a sword.Matthew 10.35–42
38
35 I have come to set a man against
his father, a daughter against her
mother, a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law;
36 and a man will find his enemies under
his own roof.
37 No one is worthy of me who cares
more for father or mother than for me;
no one is worthy of me who cares more
for son or daughter;
38 no one is worthy of me who does not
take up his cross and follow me.
39 Whoever gains his life will lose it;
whoever loses his life for my sake will
gain it.
40 To receive you is to receive me, and
to receive me is to receive the One who
sent me.
41 Whoever receives a prophet because
he is a prophet will be given a prophet's
reward, and whoever receives a good
man because he is a good man will be
given a good man's reward.
42 Truly I tell you: anyone who gives
so much as a cup of cold water to one
of these little ones because he is a
disciple of mine, will certainly not go
unrewarded.Matthew 11.1–8
39
1 When Jesus had finished
11 giving instructions to his twelve
disciples, he went from there to teach
and preach in the neighbouring towns.
2 JOHN, who was in prison, heard what
Christ was doing, and sent his own
disciples
3 to put this question to him: Are you
the one who is to come, or are we to
expect someone else?
4 Jesus answered, Go and report to
John what you hear and see:
5 the blind recover their sight, the lame
walk, lepers are made clean, the deaf
hear, the dead are raised to life, the poor
are brought good news --
6 and blessed are those who do not find
me an obstacle to faith.
7 When the messengers were on their
way back, Jesus began to speak to
the crowds about John: What was
the spectacle that drew you to the
wilderness? A reed swaying in the wind?
8 No? Then what did you go out to see?
A man dressed in finery? Fine clothes
are to be found in palaces.Matthew 11.9–17
40
9 But why did you go out? To see a
prophet? Yes indeed, and far more than
a prophet.
10 He is the man of whom scripture
says, Here is my herald, whom I send
ahead of you, and he will prepare your
way before you.
11 Truly I tell you: among all who have
ever been born, no one has been greater
than John the Baptist, and yet the least
in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than
he.
12 Since the time of John the Baptist the
kingdom of Heaven has been subjected
to violence and violent men are taking it
by force.
13 For until John, all the prophets and
the law foretold things to come;
14 and John is the destined Elijah, if you
will but accept it.
15 If you have ears, then hear.
16 How can I describe this generation?
They are like children sitting in the
market-place and calling to each other,
17 We piped for you and you would not
dance. We lamented, and you would not
mourn.Matthew 11.18–23
41
18 For John came, neither eating
nor drinking, and people say, He is
possessed;
19 the Son of Man came, eating and
drinking, and they say, Look at him!
A glutton and a drinker, a friend of
tax-collectors and sinners! Yet God's
wisdom is proved right by its results.
20 THEN he spoke of the towns in
which most of his miracles had been
performed, and denounced them for
their impenitence.
21 Alas for you, Chorazin! he said.
Alas for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles
performed in you had taken place in Tyre
and Sidon, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
22 But it will be more bearable, I tell
you, for Tyre and Sidon on the day of
judgement than for you.
23 As for you, Capernaum, will you
be exalted to heaven? No, you will
be brought down to Hades! For if the
miracles performed in you had taken
place in Sodom, Sodom would be
standing to this day.Matthew 11.24–12.1
42
24 But it will be more bearable, I tell
you, for the land of Sodom on the day of
judgement than for you.
25 At that time Jesus spoke these words:
I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, for hiding these things from the
learned and wise, and revealing them to
the simple.
26 Yes, Father, such was your choice.
27 Everything is entrusted to me by my
Father; and no one knows the Son but
the Father, and no one knows the Father
but the Son and those to whom the Son
chooses to reveal him.
28 Come to me, all who are weary and
whose load is heavy; I will give you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you, and
learn from me, for I am gentle and
humble-hearted; and you will find rest
for your souls.
30 For my yoke is easy to wear, my load
is light.
1 ABOUT that time Jesus was
going through the cornfields on
the sabbath; and his disciples, feeling
hungry, began to pluck some ears of
corn and eat them.
12Matthew 12.2–10
43
2 When the Pharisees saw this, they
said to him, Look, your disciples are
doing what is forbidden on the sabbath.
3 He answered, Have you not read what
David did when he and his men were
hungry?
4 He went into the house of God and ate
the sacred bread, though neither he nor
his men had a right to eat it, but only
the priests.
5 Or have you not read in the law that
on the sabbath the priests in the temple
break the sabbath and they are not held
to be guilty?
6 But I tell you, there is something
greater than the temple here.
7 If you had known what this text
means, It is mercy I require, not
sacrifice, you would not have condemned
the innocent.
8 For the Son of Man is lord of the
sabbath.
9 He went on to another place, and
entered their synagogue.
10 A man was there with a withered arm,
and they asked Jesus, Is it permitted to
heal on the sabbath? (They wanted to
bring a charge against him.)Matthew 12.11–19
44
11 But he said to them, Suppose you
had one sheep, and it fell into a ditch on
the sabbath; is there a single one of you
who would not catch hold of it and lift it
out?
12 Surely a man is worth far more than
a sheep! It is therefore permitted to do
good on the sabbath.
13 Then he said to the man, Stretch out
your arm. He stretched it out, and it was
made sound again like the other.
14 But the Pharisees, on leaving the
synagogue, plotted to bring about
Jesus's death.
15 Jesus was aware of it and withdrew,
and many followed him. He healed all
who were ill,
16 and gave strict instructions that they
were not to make him known.
17 This was to fulfil Isaiah's prophecy:
18 Here is my servant, whom I have
chosen, my beloved, in whom I take
delight; I will put my Spirit upon him,
and he will proclaim justice among the
nations.
19 He will not strive, he will not shout,
nor will his voice be heard in the streets.Matthew 12.20–27
45
20 He will not snap off a broken reed,
nor snuff out a smouldering wick, until
he leads justice on to victory.
21 In him the nations shall put their
hope.
22 THEN they brought him a man who
was possessed by a demon; he was
blind and dumb, and Jesus cured him,
restoring both speech and sight.
23 The bystanders were all amazed, and
the word went round: Can this be the
Son of David?
24 But when the Pharisees heard it they
said, It is only by Beelzebul prince of
devils that this man drives the devils
out.
25 Knowing what was in their minds,
he said to them, Every kingdom divided
against itself is laid waste; and no town
or household that is divided against itself
can stand.
26 And if it is Satan who drives out
Satan, he is divided against himself; how
then can his kingdom stand?
27 If it is by Beelzebul that I drive out
devils, by whom do your own people
drive them out? If this is your argument,
they themselves will refute you.Matthew 12.28–34
46
28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that
I drive out the devils, then be sure the
kingdom of God has already come upon
you.
29 Or again, how can anyone break into
a strong man's house and make off with
his goods, unless he has first tied up the
strong man? Then he can ransack the
house.
30 He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me
scatters.
31 So I tell you this: every sin and every
slander can be forgiven, except slander
spoken against the Spirit; that will not
be forgiven.
32 Anyone who speaks a word against
the Son of Man will be forgiven; but if
anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit,
for him there will be no forgiveness,
either in this age or in the age to come.
33 Get a good tree and its fruit will be
good; get a bad tree and its fruit will be
bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
34 Vipers brood! How can your words be
good when you yourselves are evil? It is
from the fullness of the heart that the
mouth speaks.Matthew 12.35–42
47
35 Good people from their store of good
produce good; and evil people from their
store of evil produce evil.
36 I tell you this: every thoughtless
word you speak you will have to account
for on the day of judgement.
37 For out of your own mouth you will
be acquitted; out of your own mouth you
will be condemned.
38 At this some of the scribes and the
Pharisees said, Teacher, we would like
you to show us a sign.
39 He answered: It is a wicked, godless
generation that asks for a sign, and the
only sign that will be given it is the sign
of the prophet Jonah.
40 Just as Jonah was in the sea
monster's belly for three days and three
nights, so the Son of Man will be three
days and three nights in the bowels of
the earth.
41 The men of Nineveh will appear in
court when this generation is on trial,
and ensure its condemnation, for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah; and
what is here is greater than Jonah.
42 The queen of the south will appear
in court when this generation is on trial,Matthew 12.43–48
48
and ensure its condemnation; for she
came from the ends of the earth to listen
to the wisdom of Solomon, and what is
here is greater than Solomon.
43 When an unclean spirit comes out
of someone it wanders over the desert
sands seeking a resting-place, and finds
none.
44 Then it says, I will go back to the
home I left. So it returns and finds the
house unoccupied, swept clean, and tidy.
45 It goes off and collects seven other
spirits more wicked than itself, and they
all come in and settle there; and in the
end that person's plight is worse than
before. That is how it will be with this
wicked generation.
46 He was still speaking to the crowd
when his mother and brothers appeared;
they stood outside, wanting to speak to
him.
47 Someone said, Your mother and your
brothers are standing outside; they want
to speak to you.
48 Jesus turned to the man who brought
the message, and said, Who is my
mother? Who are my brothers?Matthew 12.49–13.9
49
49 and pointing to his disciples, he said,
Here are my mother and my brothers.
50 Whoever does the will of my heavenly
Father is my brother and sister and
mother.
1 THAT same day Jesus went out
and sat by the lakeside,
2 where so many people gathered round
him that he had to get into a boat. He
sat there, and all the people stood on
the shore.
3 He told them many things in parables.
He said: A sower went out to sow.
4 And as he sowed, some of the seed
fell along the footpath; and the birds
came and ate it up.
5 Some fell on rocky ground, where it
had little soil, and it sprouted quickly
because it had no depth of earth;
6 but when the sun rose it was scorched,
and as it had no root it withered away.
7 Some fell among thistles; and the
thistles grew up and choked it.
8 And some of the seed fell on good
soil, where it produced a crop, some a
hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some
thirtyfold.
9 If you have ears, then hear.
13Matthew 13.10–16
50
10 The disciples came to him and asked,
Why do you speak to them in parables?
11 He replied, To you it has been granted
to know the secrets of the kingdom of
Heaven, but not to them.
12 For those who have will be given
more, till they have enough and to
spare; and those who have not will
forfeit even what they have.
13 That is why I speak to them
in parables; for they look without
seeing, and listen without hearing or
understanding.
14 The prophecy of Isaiah is being
fulfilled in them: You may listen and
listen, but you will never understand;
you may look and look, but you will
never see.
15 For this people's mind has become
dull; they have stopped their ears and
shut their eyes. Otherwise, their eyes
might see, their ears hear, and their
mind understand, and then they might
turn to me, and I would heal them.
16 But happy are your eyes because
they see, and your ears because they
hear!Matthew 13.17–23
51
17 Truly I tell you: many prophets and
saints longed to see what you now see,
yet never saw it; to hear what you hear,
yet never heard it.
18 Hear then the parable of the sower.
19 When anyone hears the word that
tells of the Kingdom, but fails to
understand it, the evil one comes and
carries off what has been sown in his
heart; that is the seed sown along the
footpath.
20 The seed sown on rocky ground
stands for the person who hears the
word and accepts it at once with joy;
21 it strikes no root in him and he has
no staying-power; when there is trouble
or persecution on account of the word he
quickly loses faith.
22 The seed sown among thistles
represents the person who hears the
word, but worldly cares and the false
glamour of wealth choke it, and it proves
barren.
23 But the seed sown on good soil is
the person who hears the word and
understands it; he does bear fruit and
yields a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or
thirtyfold.Matthew 13.24–31
52
24 Here is another parable he gave
them: The kingdom of Heaven is like
this. A man sowed his field with good
seed;
25 but while everyone was asleep his
enemy came, sowed darnel among the
wheat, and made off.
26 When the corn sprouted and began to
fill out, the darnel could be seen among
it.
27 The farmer's men went to their
master and said, Sir, was it not good
seed that you sowed in your field? So
where has the darnel come from?
28 This is an enemy's doing, he replied.
Well then, they said, shall we go and
gather the darnel?
29 No, he answered; in gathering it you
might pull up the wheat at the same
time.
30 Let them both grow together till
harvest; and at harvest time I will tell
the reapers, Gather the darnel first, and
tie it in bundles for burning; then collect
the wheat into my barn.
31 This is another parable he gave them:
The kingdom of Heaven is like a mustardMatthew 13.32–38
53
seed, which a man took and sowed in his
field.
32 Mustard is smaller than any other
seed, but when it has grown it is taller
than other plants; it becomes a tree, big
enough for the birds to come and roost
among its branches.
33 He told them also this parable: The
kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which
a woman took and mixed with three
measures of flour till it was all leavened.
34 In all this teaching to the crowds
Jesus spoke in parables; indeed he never
spoke to them except in parables.
35 This was to fulfil the saying of
the prophet: I will open my mouth in
parables; I will utter things kept secret
since the world was made.
36 Then he sent the people away, and
went into the house, where his disciples
came to him and said, Explain to us the
parable of the darnel in the field.
37 He replied, The sower of the good
seed is the Son of Man.
38 The field is the world; the good seed
stands for the children of the Kingdom,
the darnel for the children of the evil
one,Matthew 13.39–46
54
39 and the enemy who sowed the darnel
is the devil. The harvest is the end of
time, and the reapers are angels.
40 As the darnel is gathered up and
burnt, so at the end of time
41 the Son of Man will send his angels,
who will gather out of his kingdom every
cause of sin, and all whose deeds are
evil;
42 these will be thrown into the blazing
furnace, where there will be wailing and
grinding of teeth.
43 Then the righteous will shine like the
sun in the kingdom of their Father. If you
have ears, then hear.
44 The kingdom of Heaven is like
treasure which a man found buried in a
field. He buried it again, and in joy went
and sold everything he had, and bought
the field.
45 Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like
this. A merchant looking out for fine
pearls
46 found one of very special value; so
he went and sold everything he had and
bought it.Matthew 13.47–54
55
47 Again the kingdom of Heaven is like
a net cast into the sea, where it caught
fish of every kind.
48 When it was full, it was hauled
ashore. Then the men sat down and
collected the good fish into baskets and
threw the worthless away.
49 That is how it will be at the end of
time. The angels will go out, and they
will separate the wicked from the good,
50 and throw them into the blazing
furnace, where there will be wailing and
grinding of teeth.
51 Have you understood all this? he
asked; and they answered, Yes.
52 So he said to them, When, therefore,
a teacher of the law has become a
learner in the kingdom of Heaven, he
is like a householder who can produce
from his store things new and old.
53 WHEN Jesus had finished these
parables he left that place,
54 and came to his home town, where
he taught the people in their synagogue.
In amazement they asked, Where does
he get this wisdom from, and these
miraculous powers?Matthew 13.55–14.5
56
55 Is he not the carpenter's son? Is
not his mother called Mary, his brothers
James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
56 And are not all his sisters here with
us? Where does he get all this from?
57 So they turned against him. Jesus
said to them, A prophet never lacks
honour, except in his home town and in
his own family.
58 And he did not do many miracles
there, such was their want of faith.
1 IT was at that time that reports
about Jesus reached Herod the
tetrarch.
2 This is John the Baptist, he said to his
attendants; he has been raised from the
dead, and that is why these miraculous
powers are at work in him.
3 Now Herod had arrested John, put him
in chains, and thrown him into prison, on
account of Herodias, his brother Philip's
wife;
4 for John had told him: You have no
right to her.
5 Herod would have liked to put him to
death, but he was afraid of the people,
in whose eyes John was a prophet.
14Matthew 14.6–15
57
6 But at his birthday celebrations the
daughter of Herodias danced before the
guests, and Herod was so delighted
7 that he promised on oath to give her
anything she asked for.
8 Prompted by her mother, she said,
Give me here on a dish the head of John
the Baptist.
9 At this the king was distressed, but
because of his oath and his guests, he
ordered the request to be granted,
10 and had John beheaded in prison.
11 The head was brought on a dish and
given to the girl; and she carried it to
her mother.
12 Then John's disciples came and took
away the body, and buried it; and they
went and told Jesus.
13 WHEN he heard what had happened
Jesus withdrew privately by boat to a
remote place; but large numbers of
people heard of it, and came after him
on foot from the towns.
14 When he came ashore and saw a
large crowd, his heart went out to them,
and he healed those who were sick.
15 As evening drew on, the disciples
came up to him and said, This is aMatthew 14.16–23
58
remote place and the day has gone;
send the people off to the villages to buy
themselves food.
16 Jesus answered, There is no need for
them to go; give them something to eat
yourselves.
17 All we have here, they said, is five
loaves and two fish.
18 Bring them to me, he replied.
19 So he told the people to sit down on
the grass; then, taking the five loaves
and the two fish, he looked up to heaven,
said the blessing, broke the loaves, and
gave them to the disciples; and the
disciples gave them to the people.
20 They all ate and were satisfied; and
twelve baskets were filled with what was
left over.
21 Some five thousand men shared
in this meal, not counting women and
children.
22 As soon as they had finished, he
made the disciples embark and cross to
the other side ahead of him, while he
dismissed the crowd;
23 then he went up the hill by himself
to pray. It had grown late, and he was
there alone.Matthew 14.24–33
59
24 The boat was already some distance
from the shore, battling with a head
wind and a rough sea.
25 Between three and six in the morning
he came towards them, walking across
the lake.
26 When the disciples saw him walking
on the lake they were so shaken that
they cried out in terror: It is a ghost!
27 But at once Jesus spoke to them:
Take heart! It is I; do not be afraid.
28 Peter called to him: Lord, if it is you,
tell me to come to you over the water.
29 Come, said Jesus. Peter got down out
of the boat, and walked over the water
towards Jesus.
30 But when he saw the strength of the
gale he was afraid; and beginning to
sink, he cried, Save me, Lord!
31 Jesus at once reached out and caught
hold of him. Why did you hesitate? he
said. How little faith you have!
32 Then they climbed into the boat; and
the wind dropped.
33 And the men in the boat fell at his
feet, exclaiming, You must be the Son of
God.Matthew 14.34–15.6
60
34 So they completed the crossing and
landed at Gennesaret.
35 The people there recognized Jesus
and sent word to all the country round.
They brought to him all who were ill
36 and begged him to let them simply
touch the edge of his cloak; and all who
touched it were completely cured.
1 THEN Jesus was approached by
a group of Pharisees and scribes
from Jerusalem, with the question:
2 Why do your disciples break the
ancient tradition? They do not wash their
hands before eating.
3 He answered them: And what
about you? Why do you break God's
commandment in the interest of your
tradition?
4 For God said, Honour your father and
mother, and Whoever curses his father
or mother shall be put to death.
5 But you say, Whoever says to his
father or mother, Anything I have which
might have been used for your benefit is
set apart for God,
6 must not honour his father or his
mother. You have made God's law null
and void out of regard for your tradition.
15Matthew 15.7–17
61
7 What hypocrites! How right Isaiah was
when he prophesied about you:
8 This people pays me lip-service, but
their heart is far from me;
9 they worship me in vain, for they
teach as doctrines the commandments
of men.
10 He called the crowd and said to them,
Listen and understand!
11 No one is defiled by what goes into
his mouth; only by what comes out of it.
12 Then the disciples came to him and
said, Do you know that the Pharisees
have taken great offence at what you
have been saying?
13 He answered: Any plant that is not
of my heavenly Father's planting will be
rooted up.
14 Leave them alone; they are blind
guides, and if one blind man guides
another they will both fall into the ditch.
15 Then Peter said, Tell us what that
parable means.
16 Jesus said, Are you still as dull as the
rest?
17 Do you not see that whatever goes in
by the mouth passes into the stomach
and so is discharged into the drain?Matthew 15.18–26
62
18 But what comes out of the mouth has
its origins in the heart; and that is what
defiles a person.
19 Wicked thoughts, murder, adultery,
fornication, theft, perjury, slander --
these all proceed from the heart;
20 and these are the things that defile a
person; but to eat without first washing
his hands, that cannot defile him.
21 JESUS then withdrew to the region of
Tyre and Sidon.
22 And a Canaanite woman from those
parts came to meet him crying, Son of
David! Have pity on me; my daughter is
tormented by a devil.
23 But he said not a word in reply. His
disciples came and urged him: Send her
away! See how she comes shouting after
us.
24 Jesus replied, I was sent to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel, and to them
alone.
25 But the woman came and fell at his
feet and cried, Help me, sir.
26 Jesus replied, It is not right to take
the children's bread and throw it to the
dogs.Matthew 15.27–32
63
27 True, sir, she answered, and yet the
dogs eat the scraps that fall from their
master's table.
28 Hearing this Jesus replied, What faith
you have! Let it be as you wish! And
from that moment her daughter was
restored to health.
29 After leaving that region Jesus took
the road by the sea of Galilee, where he
climbed a hill and sat down.
30 Crowds flocked to him, bringing
with them the lame, blind, dumb, and
crippled, and many other sufferers; they
put them down at his feet, and he healed
them.
31 Great was the amazement of the
people when they saw the dumb
speaking, the crippled made strong, the
lame walking, and the blind with their
sight restored; and they gave praise to
the God of Israel.
32 Jesus called his disciples and said
to them, My heart goes out to these
people; they have been with me now for
three days and have nothing to eat. I
do not want to send them away hungry;
they might faint on the way.Matthew 15.33–16.3
64
33 The disciples replied, Where in this
remote place can we find bread enough
to feed such a crowd?
34 How many loaves have you? Jesus
asked. Seven, they replied, and a few
small fish.
35 So he ordered the people to sit down
on the ground;
36 then he took the seven loaves and
the fish, and after giving thanks to God
he broke them and gave them to the
disciples, and the disciples gave them to
the people.
37 They all ate and were satisfied; and
seven baskets were filled with what was
left over.
38 Those who were fed numbered four
thousand men, not counting women and
children.
39 After dismissing the crowd, he
got into a boat and went to the
neighbourhood of Magadan.
1 The Pharisees and Sadducees
came, and to test him they asked
him to show them a sign from heaven.
2 He answered:
3 [[EMPTY]]
16Matthew 16.4–12
65
4 It is a wicked, godless generation that
asks for a sign; and the only sign that
will be given it is the sign of Jonah. With
that he left them and went away.
5 In crossing to the other side the
disciples had forgotten to take any
bread.
6 So when Jesus said to them, Take
care; be on your guard against the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,
7 they began to say to one another, We
have brought no bread!
8 Knowing what they were discussing,
Jesus said, Why are you talking about
having no bread? Where is your faith?
9 Do you still not understand? Have
you forgotten the five loaves for the five
thousand, and how many basketfuls you
picked up?
10 Or the seven loaves for the four
thousand, and how many basketfuls you
picked up?
11 How can you fail to see that I was not
talking about bread? Be on your guard, I
said, against the leaven of the Pharisees
and Sadducees.
12 Then they understood: they were to
be on their guard, not against baker'sMatthew 16.13–19
66
leaven, but against the teaching of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.
13 WHEN he came to the territory
of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his
disciples, Who do people say that the
Son of Man is?
14 They answered, Some say John the
Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah,
or one of the prophets.
15 And you, he asked, who do you say I
am?
16 Simon Peter answered: You are the
Messiah, the Son of the living God.
17 Then Jesus said: Simon son of Jonah,
you are favoured indeed! You did not
learn that from any human being; it was
revealed to you by my heavenly Father.
18 And I say to you: you are Peter, the
Rock; and on this rock I will build my
church, and the powers of death shall
never conquer it.
19 I will give you the keys of the
kingdom of Heaven; what you forbid on
earth shall be forbidden in heaven, and
what you allow on earth shall be allowed
in heaven.Matthew 16.20–26
67
20 He then gave his disciples strict
orders not to tell anyone that he was the
Messiah.
21 From that time Jesus began to make
it clear to his disciples that he had to go
to Jerusalem, and endure great suffering
at the hands of the elders, chief priests,
and scribes; to be put to death, and to
be raised again on the third day.
22 At this Peter took hold of him and
began to rebuke him: Heaven forbid! he
said. No, Lord, this shall never happen
to you.
23 Then Jesus turned and said to Peter,
Out of my sight, Satan; you are a
stumbling block to me. You think as men
think, not as God thinks.
24 Jesus then said to his disciples,
Anyone who wishes to be a follower of
mine must renounce self; he must take
up his cross and follow me.
25 Whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for my
sake will find it. What will anyone gain
by winning the whole world at the cost
of his life? Or what can he give to buy
his life back?
26 (16:25)Matthew 16.27–17.6
68
27 For the Son of Man is to come in
the glory of his Father with his angels,
and then he will give everyone his due
reward.
28 Truly I tell you: there are some of
those standing here who will not taste
death before they have seen the Son of
Man coming in his kingdom.
1 SIX days later Jesus took Peter,
James, and John the brother of
James, and led them up a high mountain
by themselves.
2 And in their presence he was
transfigured; his face shone like the sun,
and his clothes became a brilliant white.
3 And they saw Moses and Elijah appear,
talking with him.
4 Then Peter spoke: Lord, he said, it is
good that we are here. Would you like
me to make three shelters here, one for
you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah?
5 While he was still speaking, a bright
cloud suddenly cast its shadow over
them, and a voice called from the cloud:
This is my beloved Son, in whom I take
delight; listen to him.
6 At the sound of the voice the disciples
fell on their faces in terror.
17Matthew 17.7–15
69
7 Then Jesus came up to them, touched
them, and said, Stand up; do not be
afraid.
8 And when they raised their eyes there
was no one but Jesus to be seen.
9 On their way down the mountain,
Jesus commanded them not to tell
anyone of the vision until the Son of Man
had been raised from the dead.
10 The disciples put a question to him:
Why then do the scribes say that Elijah
must come first?
11 He replied, Elijah is to come and set
everything right.
12 But I tell you that Elijah has already
come, and they failed to recognize him,
and did to him as they wanted; in the
same way the Son of Man is to suffer at
their hands.
13 Then the disciples understood that he
meant John the Baptist.
14 When they returned to the crowd, a
man came up to Jesus, fell on his knees
before him, and said,
15 Have pity, sir, on my son: he is
epileptic and has bad fits; he keeps
falling into the fire or into the water.Matthew 17.16–24
70
16 I brought him to your disciples, but
they could not cure him.
17 Jesus answered, What an unbelieving
and perverse generation! How long shall
I be with you? How long must I endure
you? Bring him here to me.
18 Then Jesus spoke sternly to him;
the demon left the boy, and from that
moment he was cured.
19 Afterwards the disciples came to
Jesus and asked him privately, Why
could we not drive it out?
20 He answered, Your faith is too small.
Truly I tell you: if you have faith no
bigger than a mustard seed, you will
say to this mountain, Move from here to
there! and it will move; nothing will be
impossible for you.
21 [[EMPTY]]
22 THEY were going about together in
Galilee when Jesus said to them, The
Son of Man is to be handed over into the
power of men,
23 and they will kill him; then on the
third day he will be raised again. And
they were filled with grief.
24 On their arrival at Capernaum the
collectors of the temple tax came up toMatthew 17.25–18.5
71
Peter and asked, Does your master not
pay temple tax?
25 He does, said Peter. When he went
indoors Jesus forestalled him by asking,
Tell me, Simon, from whom do earthly
monarchs collect tribute money? From
their own people, or from aliens?
26 From aliens, said Peter. Yes, said
Jesus, and their own people are exempt.
27 But as we do not want to cause
offence, go and cast a line in the lake;
take the first fish you catch, open its
mouth, and you will find a silver coin;
take that and pay the tax for us both.
1 AT that time the disciples came
to Jesus and asked, Who is the
greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?
2 He called a child, set him in front of
them,
3 and said, Truly I tell you: unless you
turn round and become like children, you
will never enter the kingdom of Heaven.
4 Whoever humbles himself and
becomes like this child will be the
greatest in the kingdom of Heaven,
5 and whoever receives one such child
in my name receives me.
18Matthew 18.6–12
72
6 But if anyone causes the downfall of
one of these little ones who believe in
me, it would be better for him to have
a millstone hung round his neck and be
drowned in the depths of the sea.
7 Alas for the world that any of them
should be made to fall! Such things must
happen, but alas for the one through
whom they happen!
8 If your hand or your foot causes your
downfall, cut it off and fling it away; it is
better for you to enter into life maimed
or lame, than to keep two hands or two
feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
9 And if your eye causes your downfall,
tear it out and fling it away; it is better
to enter into life with one eye than to
keep both eyes and be thrown into the
fires of hell.
10 See that you do not despise one
of these little ones; I tell you, they
have their angels in heaven, who look
continually on the face of my heavenly
Father.
11 [[EMPTY]]
12 What do you think? Suppose someone
has a hundred sheep, and one of them
strays, does he not leave the otherMatthew 18.13–19
73
ninety-nine on the hillside and go in
search of the one that strayed?
13 Truly I tell you: if he should find it, he
is more delighted over that sheep than
over the ninety-nine that did not stray.
14 In the same way, it is not your
heavenly Father's will that one of these
little ones should be lost.
15 If your brother does wrong, go and
take the matter up with him, strictly
between yourselves. If he listens to you,
you have won your brother over.
16 But if he will not listen, take one or
two others with you, so that every case
may be settled on the evidence of two or
three witnesses.
17 If he refuses to listen to them, report
the matter to the congregation; and if he
will not listen even to the congregation,
then treat him as you would a pagan or
a tax-collector.
18 Truly I tell you: whatever you forbid
on earth shall be forbidden in heaven,
and whatever you allow on earth shall be
allowed in heaven.
19 And again I tell you: if two of you
agree on earth about any request youMatthew 18.20–27
74
have to make, that request will be
granted by my heavenly Father.
20 For where two or three meet together
in my name, I am there among them.
21 Then Peter came to him and asked,
Lord, how often am I to forgive my
brother if he goes on wronging me? As
many as seven times?
22 Jesus replied, I do not say seven
times but seventy times seven.
23 The kingdom of Heaven, therefore,
should be thought of in this way: There
was once a king who decided to settle
accounts with the men who served him.
24 At the outset there appeared before
him a man who owed ten thousand
talents.
25 Since he had no means of paying,
his master ordered him to be sold, with
his wife, his children, and everything he
had, to meet the debt.
26 The man fell at his master's feet. Be
patient with me, he implored, and I will
pay you in full;
27 and the master was so moved with
pity that he let the man go and cancelled
the debt.Matthew 18.28–19.1
75
28 But no sooner had the man gone out
than he met a fellow-servant who owed
him a hundred denarii; he took hold of
him, seizing him by the throat, and said,
Pay me what you owe.
29 The man fell at his fellow-servant's
feet, and begged him, Be patient with
me, and I will pay you;
30 but he refused, and had him thrown
into jail until he should pay the debt.
31 The other servants were deeply
distressed when they saw what had
happened, and they went to their master
and told him the whole story.
32 Then he sent for the man and said,
You scoundrel! I cancelled the whole of
your debt when you appealed to me;
33 ought you not to have shown mercy
to your fellow-servant just as I showed
mercy to you?
34 And so angry was the master that he
condemned the man to be tortured until
he should pay the debt in full.
35 That is how my heavenly Father will
deal with you, unless you each forgive
your brother from your hearts.
1 WHEN Jesus had finished this
discourse he left Galilee and came
19Matthew 19.2–8
76
into the region of Judaea on the other
side of the Jordan.
2 Great crowds followed him, and he
healed them there.
3 Some Pharisees came and tested
him by asking, Is it lawful for a man
to divorce his wife for any cause he
pleases?
4 He responded by asking, Have you
never read that in the beginning the
Creator made them male and female?
5 and he added, That is why a man
leaves his father and mother, and is
united to his wife, and the two become
one flesh.
6 It follows that they are no longer two
individuals: they are one flesh. Therefore
what God has joined together, man must
not separate.
7 Then why, they objected, did Moses
lay it down that a man might divorce his
wife by a certificate of dismissal?
8 He answered, It was because of your
stubbornness that Moses gave you
permission to divorce your wives; but it
was not like that at the beginning.Matthew 19.9–16
77
9 I tell you, if a man divorces his wife
for any cause other than unchastity, and
marries another, he commits adultery.
10 The disciples said to him, If that is
how things stand for a man with a wife,
it is better not to marry.
11 To this he replied, That is a course
not everyone can accept, but only those
for whom God has appointed it.
12 For while some are incapable of
marriage because they were born so,
or were made so by men, there are
others who have renounced marriage for
the sake of the kingdom of Heaven. Let
those accept who can.
13 They brought children for him to
lay his hands on them with prayer. The
disciples rebuked them,
14 but Jesus said, Let the children come
to me; do not try to stop them; for the
kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as
these.
15 And he laid his hands on the children,
and went on his way.
16 A man came up and asked him,
Teacher, what good must I do to gain
eternal life?Matthew 19.17–24
78
17 Good? said Jesus. Why do you ask
me about that? One alone is good. But
if you wish to enter into life, keep the
commandments.
18 Which commandments? he asked.
Jesus answered, Do not murder; do not
commit adultery; do not steal; do not
give false evidence;
19 honour your father and mother; and
love your neighbour as yourself.
20 The young man answered, I have
kept all these. What do I still lack?
21 Jesus said to him, If you wish to
be perfect, go, sell your possessions,
and give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven; then come and
follow me.
22 When the young man heard this, he
went away with a heavy heart; for he
was a man of great wealth.
23 Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I tell
you: a rich man will find it hard to enter
the kingdom of Heaven.
24 I repeat, it is easier for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
God.Matthew 19.25–20.2
79
25 The disciples were astonished when
they heard this, and exclaimed, Then
who can be saved?
26 Jesus looked at them and said, For
men this is impossible; but everything is
possible for God.
27 Then Peter said, What about us? We
have left everything to follow you. How
shall we fare?
28 Jesus replied, Truly I tell you: in the
world that is to be, when the Son of Man
is seated on his glorious throne, you also
will sit on twelve thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.
29 And anyone who has left houses, or
brothers or sisters, or father or mother,
or children, or land for the sake of my
name will be repaid many times over,
and gain eternal life.
30 But many who are first will be last,
and the last first.
1 The kingdom of Heaven is like
this. There was once a landowner
who went out early one morning to hire
labourers for his vineyard;
2 and after agreeing to pay them the
usual day's wage he sent them off to
work.
20Matthew 20.3–10
80
3 Three hours later he went out again
and saw some more men standing idle in
the market-place.
4 Go and join the others in the vineyard,
he said, and I will pay you a fair wage;
so off they went.
5 At midday he went out again, and at
three in the afternoon, and made the
same arrangement as before.
6 An hour before sunset he went out and
found another group standing there; so
he said to them, Why are you standing
here all day doing nothing?
7 Because no one has hired us, they
replied; so he told them, Go and join the
others in the vineyard.
8 When evening fell, the owner of the
vineyard said to the overseer, Call the
labourers and give them their pay,
beginning with those who came last and
ending with the first.
9 Those who had started work an hour
before sunset came forward, and were
paid the full day's wage.
10 When it was the turn of the men who
had come first, they expected something
extra, but were paid the same as the
others.Matthew 20.11–19
81
11 As they took it, they grumbled at
their employer:
12 These latecomers did only one hour's
work, yet you have treated them on a
level with us, who have sweated the
whole day long in the blazing sun!
13 The owner turned to one of them and
said, My friend, I am not being unfair to
you. You agreed on the usual wage for
the day, did you not?
14 Take your pay and go home. I choose
to give the last man the same as you.
15 Surely I am free to do what I like
with my own money? Why be jealous
because I am generous?
16 So the last will be first, and the first
last.
17 JESUS was journeying towards
Jerusalem, and on the way he took the
Twelve aside and said to them,
18 We are now going up to Jerusalem,
and the Son of Man will be handed over
to the chief priests and the scribes; they
will condemn him to death
19 and hand him over to the Gentiles,
to be mocked and flogged and crucified;
and on the third day he will be raised to
life again.Matthew 20.20–27
82
20 The mother of Zebedee's sons then
approached him with her sons. She
bowed before him and begged a favour.
21 What is it you want? asked Jesus.
She replied, Give orders that in your
kingdom these two sons of mine may sit
next to you, one at your right hand and
the other at your left.
22 Jesus turned to the brothers and
said, You do not understand what you
are asking. Can you drink the cup that I
am to drink? We can, they replied.
23 You shall indeed drink my cup, he
said; but to sit on my right or on my left
is not for me to grant; that honour is
for those to whom it has already been
assigned by my Father.
24 When the other ten heard this, they
were indignant with the two brothers.
25 So Jesus called them to him and said,
You know that, among the Gentiles,
rulers lord it over their subjects, and the
great make their authority felt.
26 It shall not be so with you; among
you, whoever wants to be great must be
your servant,
27 and whoever wants to be first must
be the slave of all --Matthew 20.28–21.2
83
28 just as the Son of Man did not come
to be served but to serve, and to give his
life as a ransom for many.
29 As they were leaving Jericho he was
followed by a huge crowd.
30 At the roadside sat two blind men.
When they heard that Jesus was passing
by they shouted, Have pity on us, Son of
David.
31 People told them to be quiet, but
they shouted all the more, Sir, have pity
on us; have pity on us, Son of David.
32 Jesus stopped and called the men.
What do you want me to do for you?
33 he asked. Sir, they answered, open
our eyes.
34 Jesus was deeply moved, and touched
their eyes. At once they recovered their
sight and followed him.
1 THEY were approaching
Jerusalem, and when they
reached Bethphage at the mount of
Olives Jesus sent off two disciples,
2 and told them: Go into the village
opposite, where you will at once find a
donkey tethered with her foal beside her.
Untie them, and bring them to me.
21Matthew 21.3–11
84
3 If anyone says anything to you,
answer, The Master needs them; and he
will let you have them at once.
4 This was to fulfil the prophecy which
says,
5 Tell the daughter of Zion, Here is your
king, who comes to you in gentleness,
riding on a donkey, on the foal of a beast
of burden.
6 The disciples went and did as Jesus
had directed,
7 and brought the donkey and her foal;
they laid their cloaks on them and Jesus
mounted.
8 Crowds of people carpeted the road
with their cloaks, and some cut branches
from the trees to spread in his path.
9 Then the crowds in front and behind
raised the shout: Hosanna to the Son
of David! Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the
heavens!
10 When he entered Jerusalem the
whole city went wild with excitement.
Who is this? people asked,
11 and the crowds replied, This is the
prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.Matthew 21.12–19
85
12 Jesus went into the temple and drove
out all who were buying and selling in
the temple precincts; he upset the tables
of the money-changers and the seats of
the dealers in pigeons,
13 and said to them, Scripture says, My
house shall be called a house of prayer;
but you are making it a bandits cave.'
14 In the temple the blind and the
crippled came to him, and he healed
them.
15 When the chief priests and scribes
saw the wonderful things he did, and
heard the boys in the temple shouting,
Hosanna to the Son of David! they were
indignant
16 and asked him, Do you hear what
they are saying? Jesus answered, I do.
Have you never read the text, You have
made children and babes at the breast
sound your praise aloud?
17 Then he left them and went out of
the city to Bethany, where he spent the
night.
18 Next morning on his way to the city
he felt hungry;
19 and seeing a fig tree at the roadside
he went up to it, but found nothing on itMatthew 21.20–25
86
but leaves. He said to the tree, May you
never bear fruit again! and at once the
tree withered away.
20 The disciples were amazed at the
sight. How is it, they asked, that the tree
has withered so suddenly?
21 Jesus answered them, Truly I tell
you: if only you have faith and have no
doubts, you will do what has been done
to the fig tree. And more than that: you
need only say to this mountain, Be lifted
from your place and hurled into the sea,
and what you say will be done.
22 Whatever you pray for in faith you
will receive.
23 He entered the temple, and, as he
was teaching, the chief priests and
elders of the nation came up to him and
asked: By what authority are you acting
like this? Who gave you this authority?
24 Jesus replied, I also have a question
for you. If you answer it, I will tell you
by what authority I act.
25 The baptism of John: was it from
God, or from men? This set them arguing
among themselves: If we say, From God,
he will say, Then why did you not believe
him?Matthew 21.26–32
87
26 But if we say, From men, we are
afraid of the people's reaction, for they
all take John for a prophet.
27 So they answered, We do not know.
And Jesus said: Then I will not tell you
either by what authority I act.
28 But what do you think about this?
There was a man who had two sons. He
went to the first, and said, My son, go
and work today in the vineyard.
29 I will, sir, the boy replied; but he did
not go.
30 The father came to the second and
said the same. I will not, he replied;
but afterwards he changed his mind and
went.
31 Which of the two did what his father
wanted? The second, they replied. Then
Jesus said, Truly I tell you: tax-collectors
and prostitutes are entering the kingdom
of God ahead of you.
32 For when John came to show you the
right way to live, you did not believe him,
but the tax-collectors and prostitutes
did; and even when you had seen that,
you did not change your minds and
believe him.Matthew 21.33–41
88
33 Listen to another parable. There was
a landowner who planted a vineyard:
he put a wall round it, hewed out a
winepress, and built a watch-tower; then
he let it out to vine-growers and went
abroad.
34 When the harvest season approached,
he sent his servants to the tenants to
collect the produce due to him.
35 But they seized his servants, thrashed
one, killed another, and stoned a third.
36 Again, he sent other servants, this
time a larger number; and they treated
them in the same way.
37 Finally he sent his son. They will
respect my son, he said.
38 But when they saw the son the
tenants said to one another, This is the
heir; come on, let us kill him, and get his
inheritance.
39 So they seized him, flung him out of
the vineyard, and killed him.
40 When the owner of the vineyard
comes, how do you think he will deal
with those tenants?
41 He will bring those bad men to a
bad end, they answered, and hand the
vineyard over to other tenants, who willMatthew 21.42–22.4
89
give him his share of the crop when the
season comes.
42 Jesus said to them, Have you never
read in the scriptures: The stone which
the builders rejected has become the
main corner-stone. This is the Lord's
doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes?
43 Therefore, I tell you, the kingdom of
God will be taken away from you, and
given to a nation that yields the proper
fruit.
44 [[EMPTY]]
45 When the chief priests and Pharisees
heard his parables, they saw that he was
referring to them.
46 They wanted to arrest him, but were
afraid of the crowds, who looked on
Jesus as a prophet.
1 JESUS spoke to them again in
parables:
2 The kingdom of Heaven is like this.
There was a king who arranged a
banquet for his son's wedding;
3 but when he sent his servants to
summon the guests he had invited, they
refused to come.
4 Then he sent other servants, telling
them to say to the guests, Look! I
22Matthew 22.5–12
90
have prepared this banquet for you. My
bullocks and fatted beasts have been
slaughtered, and everything is ready.
Come to the wedding.
5 But they took no notice; one went off
to his farm, another to his business,
6 and the others seized the servants,
attacked them brutally, and killed them.
7 The king was furious; he sent troops
to put those murderers to death and set
their town on fire.
8 Then he said to his servants, The
wedding banquet is ready; but the
guests I invited did not deserve the
honour.
9 Go out therefore to the main
thoroughfares, and invite everyone you
can find to the wedding.
10 The servants went out into the
streets, and collected everyone they
could find, good and bad alike. So the
hall was packed with guests.
11 When the king came in to watch them
feasting, he observed a man who was
not dressed for a wedding.
12 My friend, said the king, how do
you come to be here without wedding
clothes? But he had nothing to say.Matthew 22.13–21
91
13 The king then said to his attendants,
Bind him hand and foot; fling him out
into the dark, the place of wailing and
grinding of teeth.
14 For many are invited, but few are
chosen.
15 THEN the Pharisees went away
and agreed on a plan to trap him in
argument.
16 They sent some of their followers to
him, together with members of Herod's
party. Teacher, they said, we know
you are a sincere man; you teach in
all sincerity the way of life that God
requires, courting no man's favour,
whoever he may be.
17 Give us your ruling on this: are we or
are we not permitted to pay taxes to the
Roman emperor?
18 Jesus was aware of their malicious
intention and said, You hypocrites! Why
are you trying to catch me out?
19 Show me the coin used for the tax.
They handed him a silver piece.
20 Jesus asked, Whose head is this, and
whose inscription?
21 Caesar's, they replied. He said to
them, Then pay to Caesar what belongsMatthew 22.22–30
92
to Caesar, and to God what belongs to
God.
22 Taken aback by this reply, they went
away and left him alone.
23 The same day Sadducees, who
maintain that there is no resurrection,
came to him and asked:
24 Teacher, Moses said that if a man
dies childless, his brother shall marry
the widow and provide an heir for his
brother.
25 We know a case involving seven
brothers. The first married and died, and
as he was without issue his wife was left
to his brother.
26 The same thing happened with the
second, and the third, and so on with all
seven.
27 Last of all the woman died.
28 At the resurrection, then, whose wife
will she be, since they had all married
her?
29 Jesus answered: How far you are
from the truth! You know neither the
scriptures nor the power of God.
30 In the resurrection men and women
do not marry; they are like angels in
heaven.Matthew 22.31–41
93
31 As for the resurrection of the dead,
have you never read what God himself
said to you:
32 I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, the God of Jacob? God is not God
of the dead but of the living.
33 When the crowds heard this, they
were amazed at his teaching.
34 Hearing that he had silenced the
Sadducees, the Pharisees came together
in a body,
35 and one of them tried to catch him
out with this question:
36 Teacher, which is the greatest
commandment in the law?
37 He answered, Love the Lord your God
with all your heart, with all your soul,
and with all your mind.
38 That is the greatest, the first
commandment.
39 The second is like it: Love your
neighbour as yourself.
40 Everything in the law and the
prophets hangs on these two
commandments.
41 Turning to the assembled Pharisees
Jesus asked them,Matthew 22.42–23.5
94
42 What is your opinion about the
Messiah? Whose son is he? The son of
David, they replied.
43 Then how is it, he asked, that David
by inspiration calls him Lord? For he
says,
44 The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my
right hand until I put your enemies under
your feet.
45 If then David calls him Lord, how can
he be David's son?'
46 Nobody was able to give him an
answer; and from that day no one dared
to put any more questions to him.
1 JESUS then addressed the
crowds and his disciples
2 in these words: The scribes and the
Pharisees occupy Moses seat;
3 so be careful to do whatever they tell
you. But do not follow their practice; for
they say one thing and do another.
4 They make up heavy loads and pile
them on the shoulders of others, but will
not themselves lift a finger to ease the
burden.
5 Whatever they do is done for
show. They go about wearing broad
23Matthew 23.6–15
95
phylacteries and with large tassels on
their robes;
6 they love to have the place of
honour at feasts and the chief seats in
synagogues,
7 to be greeted respectfully in the
street, and to be addressed as rabbi.
8 But you must not be called rabbi, for
you have one Rabbi, and you are all
brothers.
9 Do not call any man on earth father,
for you have one Father, and he is in
heaven.
10 Nor must you be called teacher; you
have one Teacher, the Messiah.
11 The greatest among you must be
your servant.
12 Whoever exalts himself will be
humbled; and whoever humbles himself
will be exalted.
13 Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You shut the door of the
kingdom of Heaven in people's faces;
you do not enter yourselves, and when
others try to enter, you stop them.
14 [[EMPTY]]
15 Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You travel over sea and landMatthew 23.16–23
96
to win one convert; and when you have
succeeded you make him twice as fit for
hell as you are yourselves.
16 Alas for you, blind guides! You say, If
someone swears by the sanctuary, that
is nothing; but if he swears by the gold
in the sanctuary, he is bound by his oath.
17 Blind fools! Which is the more
important, the gold, or the sanctuary
which sanctifies the gold?
18 Or you say, If someone swears by the
altar, that is nothing; but if he swears by
the offering that lies on the altar, he is
bound by his oath.
19 What blindness! Which is the more
important, the offering, or the altar
which sanctifies it?
20 To swear by the altar, then, is to
swear both by the altar and by whatever
lies on it;
21 to swear by the sanctuary is to swear
both by the sanctuary and by him who
dwells there;
22 and to swear by Heaven is to swear
both by the throne of God and by him
who sits upon it.
23 Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint and dillMatthew 23.24–30
97
and cummin; but you have overlooked
the weightier demands of the law --
justice, mercy, and good faith. It is
these you should have practised, without
neglecting the others.
24 Blind guides! You strain off a midge,
yet gulp down a camel!
25 Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You clean the outside of a
cup or a dish, and leave the inside full of
greed and self-indulgence!
26 Blind Pharisee! Clean the inside of
the cup first; then the outside will be
clean also.
27 Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You are like tombs covered
with whitewash; they look fine on the
outside, but inside they are full of dead
men's bones and of corruption.
28 So it is with you: outwardly you look
like honest men, but inside you are full
of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
29 Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You build up the tombs of the
prophets and embellish the monuments
of the saints,
30 and you say, If we had been living in
the time of our forefathers, we shouldMatthew 23.31–37
98
never have taken part with them in the
murder of the prophets.
31 So you acknowledge that you are the
sons of those who killed the prophets.
32 Go on then, finish off what your
fathers began!
33 Snakes! Vipers brood! How can you
escape being condemned to hell?
34 I am sending you therefore prophets
and wise men and teachers of the law;
some of them you will kill and crucify,
others you will flog in your synagogues
and hound from city to city.
35 So on you will fall the guilt of all the
innocent blood spilt on the ground, from
the blood of innocent Abel to the blood
of Zechariah son of Berachiah, whom
you murdered between the sanctuary
and the altar.
36 Truly I tell you: this generation will
bear the guilt of it all.
37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, city that
murders the prophets and stones the
messengers sent to her! How often have
I longed to gather your children, as a
hen gathers her brood under her wings;
but you would not let me.Matthew 23.38–24.6
99
38 Look! There is your temple, forsaken
by God and laid waste.
39 I tell you, you will not see me until
the time when you say, Blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord!
1 JESUS left the temple and
was walking away when his
disciples came and pointed to the temple
buildings.
2 He answered, Yes, look at it all. Truly I
tell you: not one stone will be left upon
another; they will all be thrown down.
3 As he sat on the mount of Olives the
disciples came to speak to him privately.
Tell us, they said, when will this happen?
And what will be the sign of your coming
and the end of the age?
4 Jesus replied: Take care that no one
misleads you.
5 For many will come claiming my name
and saying, I am the Messiah, and many
will be misled by them.
6 The time is coming when you will hear
of wars and rumours of wars. See that
you are not alarmed. Such things are
bound to happen; but the end is still to
come.
24Matthew 24.7–16
100
7 For nation will go to war against
nation, kingdom against kingdom; there
will be famines and earthquakes in many
places.
8 All these things are the first
birth-pangs of the new age.
9 You will then be handed over for
punishment and execution; all nations
will hate you for your allegiance to me.
10 At that time many will fall from their
faith; they will betray one another and
hate one another.
11 Many false prophets will arise, and
will mislead many;
12 and as lawlessness spreads, the love
of many will grow cold.
13 But whoever endures to the end will
be saved.
14 And this gospel of the kingdom will
be proclaimed throughout the earth as a
testimony to all nations; and then the
end will come.
15 So when you see the abomination of
desolation, of which the prophet Daniel
spoke, standing in the holy place (let the
reader understand),
16 then those who are in Judaea must
take to the hills.Matthew 24.17–25
101
17 If anyone is on the roof, he must not
go down to fetch his goods from the
house;
18 if anyone is in the field, he must not
turn back for his coat.
19 Alas for women with child in those
days, and for those who have children at
the breast!
20 Pray that it may not be winter or a
sabbath when you have to make your
escape.
21 It will be a time of great distress,
such as there has never been before
since the beginning of the world, and will
never be again.
22 If that time of troubles were not cut
short, no living thing could survive; but
for the sake of God's chosen it will be cut
short.
23 If anyone says to you then, Look,
here is the Messiah, or There he is, do
not believe it.
24 Impostors will come claiming to be
messiahs or prophets, and they will
produce great signs and wonders to
mislead, if possible, even God's chosen.
25 See, I have forewarned you.Matthew 24.26–32
102
26 If therefore they tell you, He is there
in the wilderness, do not go out; or if
they say, He is there in the inner room,
do not believe it.
27 Like a lightning-flash, that lights the
sky from east to west, will be the coming
of the Son of Man.
28 Wherever the carcass is, there will
the vultures gather.
29 As soon as that time of distress has
passed, the sun will be darkened, the
moon will not give her light; the stars
will fall from the sky, the celestial powers
will be shaken.
30 Then will appear in heaven the
sign that heralds the Son of Man. All
the peoples of the world will make
lamentation, and they will see the Son
of Man coming on the clouds of heaven
with power and great glory.
31 With a trumpet-blast he will send
out his angels, and they will gather his
chosen from the four winds, from the
farthest bounds of heaven on every side.
32 Learn a lesson from the fig tree.
When its tender shoots appear and
are breaking into leaf, you know that
summer is near.Matthew 24.33–43
103
33 In the same way, when you see all
these things, you may know that the end
is near, at the very door.
34 Truly I tell you: the present
generation will live to see it all.
35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
36 Yet about that day and hour no one
knows, not even the angels in heaven,
not even the Son; no one but the Father
alone.
37 As it was in the days of Noah, so will
it be when the Son of Man comes.
38 In the days before the flood they ate
and drank and married, until the day
that Noah went into the ark,
39 and they knew nothing until the flood
came and swept them all away. That
is how it will be when the Son of Man
comes.
40 Then there will be two men in the
field: one will be taken, the other left;
41 two women grinding at the mill: one
will be taken, the other left.
42 Keep awake, then, for you do not
know on what day your Lord will come.
43 Remember, if the householder had
known at what time of night the burglarMatthew 24.44–25.1
104
was coming, he would have stayed
awake and not let his house be broken
into.
44 Hold yourselves ready, therefore,
because the Son of Man will come at the
time you least expect him.
45 Who is the faithful and wise servant,
charged by his master to manage his
household and supply them with food at
the proper time?
46 Happy that servant if his master
comes home and finds him at work!
47 Truly I tell you: he will be put in
charge of all his master's property.
48 But if he is a bad servant and says
to himself, The master is a long time
coming,
49 and begins to bully the other servants
and to eat and drink with his drunken
friends,
50 then the master will arrive on a day
when the servant does not expect him,
at a time he has not been told.
51 He will cut him in pieces and assign
him a place among the hypocrites, where
there is wailing and grinding of teeth.
1 When the day comes, the
kingdom of Heaven will be like
25Matthew 25.2–11
105
this. There were ten girls, who took
their lamps and went out to meet the
bridegroom.
2 Five of them were foolish, and five
prudent;
3 when the foolish ones took their
lamps, they took no oil with them,
4 but the others took flasks of oil with
their lamps.
5 As the bridegroom was a long time in
coming, they all dozed off to sleep.
6 But at midnight there came a shout:
Here is the bridegroom! Come out to
meet him.
7 Then the girls all got up and trimmed
their lamps.
8 The foolish said to the prudent, Our
lamps are going out; give us some of
your oil.
9 No, they answered; there will never be
enough for all of us. You had better go to
the dealers and buy some for yourselves.
10 While they were away the bridegroom
arrived; those who were ready went in
with him to the wedding banquet; and
the door was shut.
11 Later the others came back. Sir, sir,
open the door for us, they cried.Matthew 25.12–20
106
12 But he answered, Truly I tell you: I
do not know you.
13 Keep awake then, for you know
neither the day nor the hour.
14 It is like a man going abroad, who
called his servants and entrusted his
capital to them;
15 to one he gave five bags of gold,
to another two, to another one, each
according to his ability. Then he left the
country.
16 The man who had the five bags went
at once and employed them in business,
and made a profit of five bags,
17 and the man who had the two bags
made two.
18 But the man who had been given one
bag of gold went off and dug a hole in
the ground, and hid his master's money.
19 A long time afterwards their master
returned, and proceeded to settle
accounts with them.
20 The man who had been given the five
bags of gold came and produced the five
he had made: Master, he said, you left
five bags with me; look, I have made
five more.Matthew 25.21–27
107
21 Well done, good and faithful servant!
said the master. You have proved
trustworthy in a small matter; I will now
put you in charge of something big.
Come and share your master's joy.
22 The man with the two bags then
came and said, Master, you left two bags
with me; look, I have made two more.
23 Well done, good and faithful servant!
said the master. You have proved
trustworthy in a small matter; I will now
put you in charge of something big.
Come and share your master's joy.
24 Then the man who had been given
one bag came and said, Master, I knew
you to be a hard man: you reap where
you have not sown, you gather where
you have not scattered;
25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid
your gold in the ground. Here it is -- you
have what belongs to you.
26 You worthless, lazy servant! said
the master. You knew, did you, that I
reap where I have not sown, and gather
where I have not scattered?
27 Then you ought to have put my
money on deposit, and on my return I
should have got it back with interest.Matthew 25.28–35
108
28 Take the bag of gold from him, and
give it to the one with the ten bags.
29 For everyone who has will be given
more, till he has enough and to spare;
and everyone who has nothing will forfeit
even what he has.
30 As for the useless servant, throw him
out into the dark, where there will be
wailing and grinding of teeth!
31 When the Son of Man comes in his
glory and all the angels with him, he will
sit on his glorious throne,
32 with all the nations gathered before
him. He will separate people into two
groups, as a shepherd separates the
sheep from the goats;
33 he will place the sheep on his right
hand and the goats on his left.
34 Then the king will say to those on his
right, You have my Father's blessing;
come, take possession of the kingdom
that has been ready for you since the
world was made.
35 For when I was hungry, you gave me
food; when thirsty, you gave me drink;
when I was a stranger, you took me into
your home;Matthew 25.36–44
109
36 when naked, you clothed me; when
I was ill, you came to my help; when in
prison, you visited me.
37 Then the righteous will reply, Lord,
when was it that we saw you hungry and
fed you, or thirsty and gave you drink,
38 a stranger and took you home, or
naked and clothed you?
39 When did we see you ill or in prison,
and come to visit you?
40 And the king will answer, Truly I tell
you: anything you did for one of my
brothers here, however insignificant, you
did for me.
41 Then he will say to those on his left,
A curse is on you; go from my sight to
the eternal fire that is ready for the devil
and his angels.
42 For when I was hungry, you gave me
nothing to eat; when thirsty, nothing to
drink;
43 when I was a stranger, you did not
welcome me; when I was naked, you
did not clothe me; when I was ill and in
prison, you did not come to my help.
44 And they in their turn will reply, Lord,
when was it that we saw you hungry orMatthew 25.45–26.7
110
thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in
prison, and did nothing for you?
45 And he will answer, Truly I tell you:
anything you failed to do for one of
these, however insignificant, you failed
to do for me.
46 And they will go away to eternal
punishment, but the righteous will enter
eternal life.
1 WHEN Jesus had finished all
these discourses he said to his
disciples,
2 You know that in two days' time it will
be Passover, when the Son of Man will be
handed over to be crucified.
3 Meanwhile the chief priests and the
elders of the people met in the house of
the high priest, Caiaphas,
4 and discussed a scheme to seize Jesus
and put him to death.
5 It must not be during the festival, they
said, or there may be rioting among the
people.
6 JESUS was at Bethany in the house of
Simon the leper,
7 when a woman approached him with
a bottle of very costly perfume; and she
26Matthew 26.8–17
111
began to pour it over his head as he sat
at table.
8 The disciples were indignant when
they saw it. Why this waste? they said.
9 It could have been sold for a large
sum and the money given to the poor.
10 Jesus noticed, and said to them, Why
make trouble for the woman? It is a fine
thing she has done for me.
11 You have the poor among you always,
but you will not always have me.
12 When she poured this perfume on my
body it was her way of preparing me for
burial.
13 Truly I tell you: wherever this gospel
is proclaimed throughout the world,
what she has done will be told as her
memorial.
14 THEN one of the Twelve, the man
called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief
priests
15 and said, What will you give me to
betray him to you? They weighed him
out thirty silver pieces.
16 From that moment he began to look
for an opportunity to betray him.
17 On the first day of Unleavened Bread
the disciples came and asked Jesus,Matthew 26.18–25
112
Where would you like us to prepare the
Passover for you?
18 He told them to go to a certain man in
the city with this message: The Teacher
says, My appointed time is near; I shall
keep the Passover with my disciples at
your house.
19 The disciples did as Jesus directed
them and prepared the Passover.
20 In the evening he sat down with the
twelve disciples;
21 and during supper he said, Truly I tell
you: one of you will betray me.
22 Greatly distressed at this, they asked
him one by one, Surely you do not mean
me, Lord?
23 He answered, One who has dipped
his hand into the bowl with me will
betray me.
24 The Son of Man is going the way
appointed for him in the scriptures; but
alas for that man by whom the Son of
Man is betrayed! It would be better for
that man if he had never been born.
25 Then Judas spoke, the one who was
to betray him: Rabbi, surely you do not
mean me? Jesus replied, You have said
it.Matthew 26.26–34
113
26 During supper Jesus took bread, and
having said the blessing he broke it and
gave it to the disciples with the words:
Take this and eat; this is my body.
27 Then he took a cup, and having
offered thanks to God he gave it to them
with the words: Drink from it, all of you.
28 For this is my blood, the blood of
the covenant, shed for many for the
forgiveness of sins.
29 I tell you, never again shall I drink
from this fruit of the vine until that day
when I drink it new with you in the
kingdom of my Father.
30 After singing the Passover hymn,
they went out to the mount of Olives.
31 Then Jesus said to them, Tonight you
will all lose faith because of me; for it is
written: I will strike the shepherd and
the sheep of his flock will be scattered.
32 But after I am raised, I shall go ahead
of you into Galilee.
33 Peter replied, Everyone else may lose
faith because of you, but I never will.
34 Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you:
tonight before the cock crows you will
disown me three times.Matthew 26.35–42
114
35 Peter said, Even if I have to die with
you, I will never disown you. And all the
disciples said the same.
36 JESUS then came with his disciples to
a place called Gethsemane, and he said
to them, Sit here while I go over there
to pray.
37 He took with him Peter and the two
sons of Zebedee. Distress and anguish
overwhelmed him,
38 and he said to them, My heart is
ready to break with grief. Stop here, and
stay awake with me.
39 Then he went on a little farther, threw
himself down, and prayed, My Father, if
it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Yet
not my will but yours.
40 He came back to the disciples and
found them asleep; and he said to Peter,
What! Could none of you stay awake
with me for one hour?
41 Stay awake, and pray that you may
be spared the test. The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.
42 He went away a second time and
prayed: My Father, if it is not possible
for this cup to pass me by without my
drinking it, your will be done.Matthew 26.43–51
115
43 He came again and found them
asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
44 So he left them and went away again
and prayed a third time, using the same
words as before.
45 Then he came to the disciples and
said to them, Still asleep? Still resting?
The hour has come! The Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners.
46 Up, let us go! The traitor is upon us.
47 He was still speaking when Judas,
one of the Twelve, appeared, and with
him a great crowd armed with swords
and cudgels, sent by the chief priests
and the elders of the nation.
48 The traitor had given them this sign:
The one I kiss is your man; seize him.
49 Going straight up to Jesus, he said,
Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
50 Jesus replied, Friend, do what you
are here to do. Then they came forward,
seized Jesus, and held him fast.
51 At that moment one of those with
Jesus reached for his sword and drew
it, and struck the high priest's servant,
cutting off his ear.Matthew 26.52–59
116
52 But Jesus said to him, Put up your
sword. All who take the sword die by the
sword.
53 Do you suppose that I cannot appeal
for help to my Father, and at once be
sent more than twelve legions of angels?
54 But how then would the scriptures
be fulfilled, which say that this must
happen?
55 Then Jesus spoke to the crowd: Do
you take me for a bandit, that you have
come out with swords and cudgels to
arrest me? Day after day I sat teaching
in the temple, and you did not lay hands
on me.
56 But this has all happened to fulfil
what the prophets wrote. Then the
disciples all deserted him and ran away.
57 JESUS was led away under arrest to
the house of Caiaphas the high priest,
where the scribes and elders were
assembled.
58 Peter followed him at a distance till
he came to the high priest's courtyard;
he went in and sat down among the
attendants, to see how it would all end.
59 The chief priests and the whole
Council tried to find some allegationMatthew 26.60–66
117
against Jesus that would warrant a death
sentence;
60 but they failed to find one, though
many came forward with false evidence.
Finally two men
61 alleged that he had said, I can pull
down the temple of God, and rebuild it
in three days.
62 At this the high priest rose and said
to him, Have you no answer to the
accusations that these witnesses bring
against you?
63 But Jesus remained silent. The high
priest then said, By the living God
I charge you to tell us: are you the
Messiah, the Son of God?
64 Jesus replied, The words are yours.
But I tell you this: from now on you will
see the Son of Man seated at the right
hand of the Almighty and coming on the
clouds of heaven.
65 At these words the high priest tore his
robes and exclaimed, This is blasphemy!
Do we need further witnesses? You have
just heard the blasphemy.
66 What is your verdict? He is guilty,
they answered; he should die.Matthew 26.67–75
118
67 Then they spat in his face and struck
him with their fists; some said, as they
beat him,
68 Now, Messiah, if you are a prophet,
tell us who hit you.
69 Meanwhile Peter was sitting outside
in the courtyard when a servant-girl
accosted him; You were with Jesus the
Galilean, she said.
70 Peter denied it in front of them all. I
do not know what you are talking about,
he said.
71 He then went out to the gateway,
where another girl, seeing him, said to
the people there, He was with Jesus of
Nazareth.
72 Once again he denied it, saying with
an oath, I do not know the man.
73 Shortly afterwards the bystanders
came up and said to Peter, You must
be one of them; your accent gives you
away!
74 At this he started to curse and
declared with an oath: I do not know the
man. At that moment a cock crowed;
75 and Peter remembered how Jesus
had said, Before the cock crows you willMatthew 27.1–7
119
disown me three times. And he went
outside, and wept bitterly.
1 WHEN morning came, the chief
priests and the elders of the
nation all met together to plan the death
of Jesus.
2 They bound him and led him away,
to hand him over to Pilate, the Roman
governor.
3 When Judas the traitor saw that Jesus
had been condemned, he was seized
with remorse, and returned the thirty
silver pieces to the chief priests and
elders.
4 I have sinned, he said; I have brought
an innocent man to his death. But they
said, What is that to us? It is your
concern.
5 So he threw the money down in the
temple and left; he went away and
hanged himself.
6 The chief priests took up the money,
but they said, This cannot be put into
the temple fund; it is blood-money.
7 So after conferring they used it to buy
the Potter's Field, as a burial-place for
foreigners.
27Matthew 27.8–16
120
8 This explains the name Blood Acre, by
which that field has been known ever
since;
9 and in this way fulfilment was given
to the saying of the prophet Jeremiah:
They took the thirty silver pieces, the
price set on a man's head (for that was
his price among the Israelites),
10 and gave the money for the potter's
field, as the Lord directed me.
11 Jesus was now brought before the
governor; Are you the king of the Jews?
the governor asked him. The words are
yours, said Jesus;
12 and when the chief priests and elders
brought charges against him he made
no reply.
13 Then Pilate said to him, Do you not
hear all this evidence they are bringing
against you?
14 but to the governor's great
astonishment he refused to answer a
single word.
15 At the festival season it was
customary for the governor to release
one prisoner chosen by the people.
16 There was then in custody a man of
some notoriety, called Jesus Barabbas.Matthew 27.17–24
121
17 When the people assembled Pilate
said to them, Which would you like me
to release to you -- Jesus Barabbas, or
Jesus called Messiah?
18 For he knew it was out of malice that
Jesus had been handed over to him.
19 While Pilate was sitting in court a
message came to him from his wife:
Have nothing to do with that innocent
man; I was much troubled on his account
in my dreams last night.
20 Meanwhile the chief priests and
elders had persuaded the crowd to ask
for the release of Barabbas and to have
Jesus put to death.
21 So when the governor asked, Which
of the two would you like me to release
to you? they said, Barabbas.
22 Then what am I to do with Jesus
called Messiah? asked Pilate; and with
one voice they answered, Crucify him!
23 Why, what harm has he done? asked
Pilate; but they shouted all the louder,
Crucify him!
24 When Pilate saw that he was getting
nowhere, and that there was danger of a
riot, he took water and washed his hands
in full view of the crowd. My hands areMatthew 27.25–32
122
clean of this man's blood, he declared.
See to that yourselves.
25 With one voice the people cried, His
blood be on us and on our children.
26 He then released Barabbas to them;
but he had Jesus flogged, and then
handed him over to be crucified.
27 THEN the soldiers of the governor
took Jesus into his residence, the
Praetorium, where they collected the
whole company round him.
28 They stripped him and dressed him in
a scarlet cloak;
29 and plaiting a crown of thorns they
placed it on his head, and a stick in his
right hand. Falling on their knees before
him they jeered at him: Hail, king of the
Jews!
30 They spat on him, and used the stick
to beat him about the head.
31 When they had finished mocking him,
they stripped off the cloak and dressed
him in his own clothes. Then they led
him away to be crucified.
32 On their way out they met a man
from Cyrene, Simon by name, and
pressed him into service to carry his
cross.Matthew 27.33–42
123
33 Coming to a place called Golgotha
(which means Place of a Skull),
34 they offered him a drink of wine
mixed with gall; but after tasting it he
would not drink.
35 When they had crucified him they
shared out his clothes by casting lots,
36 and then sat down there to keep
watch.
37 Above his head was placed the
inscription giving the charge against
him: This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.
38 Two bandits were crucified with him,
one on his right and the other on his left.
39 The passers-by wagged their heads
and jeered at him,
40 crying, So you are the man who was
to pull down the temple and rebuild it in
three days! If you really are the Son of
God, save yourself and come down from
the cross.
41 The chief priests with the scribes and
elders joined in the mockery:
42 He saved others, they said, but he
cannot save himself. King of Israel,
indeed! Let him come down now from
the cross, and then we shall believe him.Matthew 27.43–52
124
43 He trusted in God, did he? Let God
rescue him, if he wants him -- for he
said he was God's Son.
44 Even the bandits who were crucified
with him taunted him in the same way.
45 From midday a darkness fell over the
whole land, which lasted until three in
the afternoon;
46 and about three Jesus cried aloud,
Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? which means,
My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?
47 Hearing this, some of the bystanders
said, He is calling Elijah.
48 One of them ran at once and fetched
a sponge, which he soaked in sour wine
and held to his lips on the end of a stick.
49 But the others said, Let us see if
Elijah will come to save him.
50 Jesus again cried aloud and breathed
his last.
51 At that moment the curtain of the
temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. The earth shook, rocks split,
52 and graves opened; many of God's
saints were raised from sleep,Matthew 27.53–60
125
53 and coming out of their graves after
his resurrection entered the Holy City,
where many saw them.
54 And when the centurion and his men
who were keeping watch over Jesus
saw the earthquake and all that was
happening, they were filled with awe and
said, This must have been a son of God.
55 A NUMBER of women were also
present, watching from a distance; they
had followed Jesus from Galilee and
looked after him.
56 Among them were Mary of Magdala,
Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
57 When evening fell, a wealthy man
from Arimathaea, Joseph by name, who
had himself become a disciple of Jesus,
58 approached Pilate and asked for the
body of Jesus; and Pilate gave orders
that he should have it.
59 Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a
clean linen sheet,
60 and laid it in his own unused tomb,
which he had cut out of the rock. He
then rolled a large stone against the
entrance, and went away.Matthew 27.61–28.2
126
61 Mary of Magdala was there, and the
other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
62 Next day, the morning after the day
of preparation, the chief priests and the
Pharisees came in a body to Pilate.
63 Your excellency, they said, we recall
how that impostor said while he was still
alive, I am to be raised again after three
days.
64 We request you to give orders for
the grave to be made secure until the
third day. Otherwise his disciples may
come and steal the body, and then tell
the people that he has been raised from
the dead; and the final deception will be
worse than the first.
65 You may have a guard, said Pilate;
go and make the grave as secure as you
can.
66 So they went and made it secure by
sealing the stone and setting a guard.
1 ABOUT daybreak on the first day
of the week, when the sabbath
was over, Mary of Magdala and the other
Mary came to look at the grave.
2 Suddenly there was a violent
earthquake; an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven and came and
28Matthew 28.3–10
127
rolled away the stone, and sat down on
it.
3 His face shone like lightning; his
garments were white as snow.
4 At the sight of him the guards shook
with fear and fell to the ground as though
dead.
5 The angel spoke to the women: You,
he said, have nothing to fear. I know you
are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
6 He is not here; he has been raised, as
he said he would be. Come and see the
place where he was laid,
7 and then go quickly and tell his
disciples: He has been raised from the
dead and is going ahead of you into
Galilee; there you will see him. That is
what I came to tell you.
8 They hurried away from the tomb in
awe and great joy, and ran to bring the
news to the disciples.
9 Suddenly Jesus was there in their
path, greeting them. They came up and
clasped his feet, kneeling before him.
10 Do not be afraid, Jesus said to them.
Go and take word to my brothers that
they are to leave for Galilee. They will
see me there.Matthew 28.11–19
128
11 While the women were on their way,
some of the guard went into the city and
reported to the chief priests everything
that had happened.
12 After meeting and conferring with
the elders, the chief priests offered the
soldiers a substantial bribe
13 and told them to say, His disciples
came during the night and stole the body
while we were asleep.
14 They added, If this should reach the
governor's ears, we will put matters
right with him and see you do not suffer.
15 So they took the money and did
as they were told. Their story became
widely known, and is current in Jewish
circles to this day.
16 The eleven disciples made their way
to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus
had told them to meet him.
17 When they saw him, they knelt in
worship, though some were doubtful.
18 Jesus came near and said to them:
Full authority in heaven and on earth has
been committed to me.
19 Go therefore to all nations and make
them my disciples; baptize them in theMatthew 28.20
129
name of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit,
20 and teach them to observe all that I
have commanded you. I will be with you
always, to the end of time.Mark
1 THE beginning of the gospel of
1 Jesus Christ the Son of God.
2 IN the prophet Isaiah it stands written:
I am sending my herald ahead of you;
he will prepare your way.
3 A voice cries in the wilderness, Prepare
the way for the Lord; clear a straight
path for him.
4 John the Baptist appeared in the
wilderness proclaiming a baptism in
token of repentance, for the forgiveness
of sins;
5 and everyone flocked to him from the
countryside of Judaea and the city of
Jerusalem, and they were baptized by
him in the river Jordan, confessing their
sins.
6 John was dressed in a rough coat of
camel's hair, with a leather belt round
his waist, and he fed on locusts and wild
honey.
7 He proclaimed: After me comes one
mightier than I am, whose sandals I am
not worthy to stoop down and unfasten.Mark 1.8–16
2
8 I have baptized you with water; he
will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
9 It was at this time that Jesus came
from Nazareth in Galilee and was
baptized in the Jordan by John.
10 As he was coming up out of the water,
he saw the heavens break open and the
Spirit descend on him, like a dove.
11 And a voice came from heaven:
You are my beloved Son; in you I take
delight.
12 At once the Spirit drove him out into
the wilderness,
13 and there he remained for forty days
tempted by Satan. He was among the
wild beasts; and angels attended to his
needs.
14 AFTER John had been arrested, Jesus
came into Galilee proclaiming the gospel
of God:
15 The time has arrived; the kingdom
of God is upon you. Repent, and believe
the gospel.
16 Jesus was walking by the sea of
Galilee when he saw Simon and his
brother Andrew at work with casting-nets
in the lake; for they were fishermen.Mark 1.17–26
3
17 Jesus said to them, Come, follow me,
and I will make you fishers of men.
18 At once they left their nets and
followed him.
19 Going a little farther, he saw James
son of Zebedee and his brother John in a
boat mending their nets.
20 At once he called them; and they left
their father Zebedee in the boat with the
hired men and followed him.
21 They came to Capernaum, and on
the sabbath he went to the synagogue
and began to teach.
22 The people were amazed at his
teaching, for, unlike the scribes, he
taught with a note of authority.
23 Now there was a man in their
synagogue possessed by an unclean
spirit. He shrieked at him:
24 What do you want with us, Jesus of
Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?
I know who you are -- the Holy One of
God.
25 Jesus rebuked him: Be silent, he
said, and come out of him.
26 The unclean spirit threw the man into
convulsions and with a loud cry left him.Mark 1.27–34
4
27 They were all amazed and began
to ask one another, What is this? A
new kind of teaching! He speaks with
authority. When he gives orders, even
the unclean spirits obey.
28 His fame soon spread far and wide
throughout Galilee.
29 On leaving the synagogue, they went
straight to the house of Simon and
Andrew; and James and John went with
them.
30 Simon's mother-in-law was in bed
with a fever. As soon as they told him
about her,
31 Jesus went and took hold of her hand,
and raised her to her feet. The fever left
her, and she attended to their needs.
32 That evening after sunset they
brought to him all who were ill or
possessed by demons;
33 and the whole town was there,
gathered at the door.
34 He healed many who suffered from
various diseases, and drove out many
demons. He would not let the demons
speak, because they knew who he was.Mark 1.35–44
5
35 Very early next morning he got up
and went out. He went away to a remote
spot and remained there in prayer.
36 But Simon and his companions went
in search of him,
37 and when they found him, they said,
Everybody is looking for you.
38 He answered, Let us move on to
the neighbouring towns, so that I can
proclaim my message there as well, for
that is what I came out to do.
39 So he went through the whole of
Galilee, preaching in their synagogues
and driving out demons.
40 On one occasion he was approached
by a leper, who knelt before him and
begged for help. If only you will, said the
man, you can make me clean.
41 Jesus was moved to anger; he
stretched out his hand, touched him,
and said, I will; be clean.
42 The leprosy left him immediately, and
he was clean.
43 Then he dismissed him with this stern
warning:
44 See that you tell nobody, but go and
show yourself to the priest, and makeMark 1.45–2.6
6
the offering laid down by Moses for your
cleansing; that will certify the cure.
45 But the man went away and made
the whole story public, spreading it far
and wide, until Jesus could no longer
show himself in any town. He stayed
outside in remote places; yet people
kept coming to him from all quarters.
1 After some days he returned to
Capernaum, and news went round
that he was at home;
2 and such a crowd collected that there
was no room for them even in the
space outside the door. While he was
proclaiming the message to them,
3 a man was brought who was
paralysed. Four men were carrying him,
4 but because of the crowd they could
not get him near. So they made an
opening in the roof over the place where
Jesus was, and when they had broken
through they lowered the bed on which
the paralysed man was lying.
5 When he saw their faith, Jesus said to
the man, My son, your sins are forgiven.
6 Now there were some scribes sitting
there, thinking to themselves,
2Mark 2.7–15
7
7 How can the fellow talk like that? It
is blasphemy! Who but God can forgive
sins?
8 Jesus knew at once what they were
thinking, and said to them, Why do you
harbour such thoughts?
9 Is it easier to say to this paralysed
man, Your sins are forgiven, or to say,
Stand up, take your bed, and walk?
10 But to convince you that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins -- he turned to the paralysed man --
11 I say to you, stand up, take your bed,
and go home.
12 And he got up, and at once took his
bed and went out in full view of them all,
so that they were astounded and praised
God. Never before, they said, have we
seen anything like this.
13 Once more he went out to the
lakeside. All the crowd came to him
there, and he taught them.
14 As he went along, he saw Levi
son of Alphaeus at his seat in the
custom-house, and said to him, Follow
me; and he rose and followed him.
15 When Jesus was having a meal in his
house, many tax-collectors and sinnersMark 2.16–21
8
were seated with him and his disciples,
for there were many of them among his
followers.
16 Some scribes who were Pharisees,
observing the company in which he was
eating, said to his disciples, Why does he
eat with tax-collectors and sinners?
17 Hearing this, Jesus said to them, It
is not the healthy who need a doctor,
but the sick; I did not come to call the
virtuous, but sinners.
18 Once, when John's disciples and the
Pharisees were keeping a fast, some
people came and asked him, Why is it
that John's disciples and the disciples of
the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are
not?
19 Jesus replied, Can you expect the
bridegroom's friends to fast while the
bridegroom is with them? As long as he
is with them, there can be no fasting.
20 But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from
them; that will be the time for them to
fast.
21 No one sews a patch of unshrunk
cloth on to an old garment; if he does,Mark 2.22–3.1
9
the patch tears away from it, the new
from the old, and leaves a bigger hole.
22 No one puts new wine into old
wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst
the skins, and then wine and skins are
both lost. New wine goes into fresh
skins.
23 One sabbath he was going through
the cornfields; and as they went along
his disciples began to pluck ears of corn.
24 The Pharisees said to him, Why are
they doing what is forbidden on the
sabbath?
25 He answered, Have you never read
what David did when he and his men
were hungry and had nothing to eat?
26 He went into the house of God, in the
time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate
the sacred bread, though no one but a
priest is allowed to eat it, and even gave
it to his men.
27 He also said to them, The sabbath
was made for man, not man for the
sabbath:
28 so the Son of Man is lord even of the
sabbath.
1 On another occasion when he went
to synagogue, there was a man in
3Mark 3.2–8
10
the congregation who had a withered
arm;
2 and they were watching to see
whether Jesus would heal him on the
sabbath, so that they could bring a
charge against him.
3 He said to the man with the withered
arm, Come and stand out here.
4 Then he turned to them: Is it
permitted to do good or to do evil on the
sabbath, to save life or to kill? They had
nothing to say;
5 and, looking round at them with anger
and sorrow at their obstinate stupidity,
he said to the man, Stretch out your
arm. He stretched it out and his arm was
restored.
6 Then the Pharisees, on leaving the
synagogue, at once began plotting with
the men of Herod's party to bring about
Jesus's death.
7 JESUS went away to the lakeside
with his disciples. Great numbers from
Galilee, Judaea
8 and Jerusalem, Idumaea and
Transjordan, and the neighbourhood of
Tyre and Sidon, heard what he was doing
and came to him.Mark 3.9–19
11
9 So he told his disciples to have a boat
ready for him, to save him from being
crushed by the crowd.
10 For he healed so many that the sick
all came crowding round to touch him.
11 The unclean spirits too, when they
saw him, would fall at his feet and cry
aloud, You are the Son of God;
12 but he insisted that they should not
make him known.
13 Then he went up into the hill-country
and summoned the men he wanted; and
they came and joined him.
14 He appointed twelve to be his
companions, and to be sent out to
proclaim the gospel,
15 with authority to drive out demons.
16 The Twelve he appointed were:
Simon, whom he named Peter;
17 the sons of Zebedee, James and
his brother John, whom he named
Boanerges, Sons of Thunder;
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Matthew, Thomas, James son of
Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
19 and Judas Iscariot, the man who
betrayed him. He entered a house,Mark 3.20–28
12
20 and once more such a crowd collected
round them that they had no chance
even to eat.
21 When his family heard about it they
set out to take charge of him. He is out
of his mind, they said.
22 The scribes, too, who had come down
from Jerusalem, said, He is possessed
by Beelzebul, and, He drives out demons
by the prince of demons.
23 So he summoned them, and spoke to
them in parables: How can Satan drive
out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand;
25 if a household is divided against
itself, that house cannot stand;
26 and if Satan is divided and rebels
against himself, he cannot stand, and
that is the end of him.
27 On the other hand, no one can break
into a strong man's house and make off
with his goods unless he has first tied up
the strong man; then he can ransack the
house.
28 Truly I tell you: every sin and every
slander can be forgiven;Mark 3.29–4.2
13
29 but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit
can never be forgiven; he is guilty of an
eternal sin.
30 He said this because they had
declared that he was possessed by an
unclean spirit.
31 Then his mother and his brothers
arrived; they stayed outside and sent in
a message asking him to come out to
them.
32 A crowd was sitting round him when
word was brought that his mother and
brothers were outside asking for him.
33 Who are my mother and my brothers?
he replied.
34 And looking round at those who were
sitting in the circle about him he said,
Here are my mother and my brothers.
35 Whoever does the will of God is my
brother and sister and mother.
1 ON another occasion he began to
teach by the lakeside. The crowd that
gathered round him was so large that he
had to get into a boat on the lake and
sit there, with the whole crowd on the
beach right down to the water's edge.
2 And he taught them many things by
parables. As he taught he said:
4Mark 4.3–12
14
3 Listen! A sower went out to sow.
4 And it happened that as he sowed,
some of the seed fell along the footpath;
and the birds came and ate it up.
5 Some fell on rocky ground, where it
had little soil, and it sprouted quickly
because it had no depth of earth;
6 but when the sun rose it was scorched,
and as it had no root it withered away.
7 Some fell among thistles; and the
thistles grew up and choked the corn,
and it produced no crop.
8 And some of the seed fell into good
soil, where it came up and grew, and
produced a crop; and the yield was
thirtyfold, sixtyfold, even a hundredfold.
9 He added, If you have ears to hear,
then hear.
10 When Jesus was alone with the
Twelve and his other companions they
questioned him about the parables.
11 He answered, To you the secret of
the kingdom of God has been given; but
to those who are outside, everything
comes by way of parables,
12 so that (as scripture says) they may
look and look, but see nothing; they
may listen and listen, but understandMark 4.13–20
15
nothing; otherwise they might turn to
God and be forgiven.
13 He went on: Do you not understand
this parable? How then are you to
understand any parable?
14 The sower sows the word.
15 With some the seed falls along the
footpath; no sooner have they heard it
than Satan comes and carries off the
word which has been sown in them.
16 With others the seed falls on rocky
ground; as soon as they hear the word,
they accept it with joy,
17 but it strikes no root in them; they
have no staying-power, and when there
is trouble or persecution on account of
the word, they quickly lose faith.
18 With others again the seed falls
among thistles; they hear the word,
19 but worldly cares and the false
glamour of wealth and evil desires of all
kinds come in and choke the word, and
it proves barren.
20 But there are some with whom the
seed is sown on good soil; they accept
the word when they hear it, and they
bear fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a
hundredfold.Mark 4.21–29
16
21 He said to them, Is a lamp brought
in to be put under the measuring bowl
or under the bed? No, it is put on the
lampstand.
22 Nothing is hidden except to be
disclosed, and nothing concealed except
to be brought into the open.
23 If you have ears to hear, then hear.
24 He also said to them, Take note of
what you hear; the measure you give
is the measure you will receive, with
something more besides.
25 For those who have will be given
more, and those who have not will forfeit
even what they have.
26 He said, The kingdom of God is like
this. A man scatters seed on the ground;
27 he goes to bed at night and gets up
in the morning, and meanwhile the seed
sprouts and grows -- how, he does not
know.
28 The ground produces a crop by itself,
first the blade, then the ear, then full
grain in the ear;
29 but as soon as the crop is ripe, he
starts reaping, because harvest time has
come.Mark 4.30–38
17
30 He said, How shall we picture the
kingdom of God, or what parable shall
we use to describe it?
31 It is like a mustard seed; when sown
in the ground it is smaller than any other
seed,
32 but once sown, it springs up and
grows taller than any other plant, and
forms branches so large that birds can
roost in its shade.
33 With many such parables he used to
give them his message, so far as they
were able to receive it.
34 He never spoke to them except in
parables; but privately to his disciples he
explained everything.
35 THAT day, in the evening, he said to
them, Let us cross over to the other side
of the lake.
36 So they left the crowd and took him
with them in the boat in which he had
been sitting; and some other boats went
with him.
37 A fierce squall blew up and the waves
broke over the boat until it was all but
swamped.
38 Now he was in the stern asleep on
a cushion; they roused him and said,Mark 4.39–5.5
18
Teacher, we are sinking! Do you not
care?
39 He awoke and rebuked the wind,
and said to the sea, Silence! Be still!
The wind dropped and there was a dead
calm.
40 He said to them, Why are you such
cowards? Have you no faith even now?
41 They were awestruck and said to one
another, Who can this be? Even the wind
and the sea obey him.
1 So they came to the country of the
Gerasenes on the other side of the
lake.
2 As he stepped ashore, a man
possessed by an unclean spirit came up
to him from among the tombs
3 where he had made his home. Nobody
could control him any longer; even
chains were useless,
4 for he had often been fettered and
chained up, but had snapped his chains
and broken the fetters. No one was
strong enough to master him.
5 Unceasingly, night and day, he would
cry aloud among the tombs and on the
hillsides and gash himself with stones.
5Mark 5.6–14
19
6 When he saw Jesus in the distance,
he ran up and flung himself down before
him,
7 shouting at the top of his voice, What
do you want with me, Jesus, son of the
Most High God? In God's name do not
torment me.
8 For Jesus was already saying to him,
Out, unclean spirit, come out of the man!
9 Jesus asked him, What is your name?
My name is Legion, he said, there are so
many of us.
10 And he implored Jesus not to send
them out of the district.
11 There was a large herd of pigs
nearby, feeding on the hillside,
12 and the spirits begged him, Send us
among the pigs; let us go into them.
13 He gave them leave; and the unclean
spirits came out and went into the pigs;
and the herd, of about two thousand,
rushed over the edge into the lake and
were drowned.
14 The men in charge of them took to
their heels and carried the news to the
town and countryside; and the people
came out to see what had happened.Mark 5.15–22
20
15 When they came to Jesus and saw
the madman who had been possessed
by the legion of demons, sitting there
clothed and in his right mind, they were
afraid.
16 When eyewitnesses told them what
had happened to the madman and what
had become of the pigs,
17 they begged Jesus to leave the
district.
18 As he was getting into the boat, the
man who had been possessed begged to
go with him.
19 But Jesus would not let him. Go home
to your own people, he said, and tell
them what the Lord in his mercy has
done for you.
20 The man went off and made known
throughout the Decapolis what Jesus
had done for him; and everyone was
amazed.
21 As soon as Jesus had returned by
boat to the other shore, a large crowd
gathered round him. While he was by
the lakeside,
22 there came a synagogue president
named Jairus; and when he saw him, he
threw himself down at his feetMark 5.23–30
21
23 and pleaded with him. My little
daughter is at death's door, he said. I
beg you to come and lay your hands on
her so that her life may be saved.
24 So Jesus went with him, accompanied
by a great crowd which pressed round
him.
25 Among them was a woman who had
suffered from haemorrhages for twelve
years;
26 and in spite of long treatment by
many doctors, on which she had spent all
she had, she had become worse rather
than better.
27 She had heard about Jesus, and
came up behind him in the crowd and
touched his cloak;
28 for she said, If I touch even his
clothes, I shall be healed.
29 And there and then the flow of blood
dried up and she knew in herself that
she was cured of her affliction.
30 Aware at once that power had gone
out of him, Jesus turned round in the
crowd and asked, Who touched my
clothes?Mark 5.31–38
22
31 His disciples said to him, You see the
crowd pressing round you and yet you
ask, Who touched me?
32 But he kept looking around to see
who had done it.
33 Then the woman, trembling with fear
because she knew what had happened
to her, came and fell at his feet and told
him the whole truth.
34 He said to her, Daughter, your faith
has healed you. Go in peace, free from
your affliction.
35 While he was still speaking, a
message came from the president's
house, Your daughter has died; why
trouble the teacher any more?
36 But Jesus, overhearing the message
as it was delivered, said to the president
of the synagogue, Do not be afraid;
simply have faith.
37 Then he allowed no one to accompany
him except Peter and James and James's
brother John.
38 They came to the president's house,
where he found a great commotion, with
loud crying and wailing.Mark 5.39–6.3
23
39 So he went in and said to them, Why
this crying and commotion? The child is
not dead: she is asleep;
40 and they laughed at him. After
turning everyone out, he took the
child's father and mother and his own
companions into the room where the
child was.
41 Taking hold of her hand, he said to
her, Talitha cum, which means, Get up,
my child.
42 Immediately the girl got up and
walked about -- she was twelve
years old. They were overcome with
amazement;
43 but he gave them strict instructions
not to let anyone know about it, and told
them to give her something to eat.
1 From there he went to his home
town accompanied by his disciples.
2 When the sabbath came he began to
teach in the synagogue; and the large
congregation who heard him asked in
amazement, Where does he get it from?
What is this wisdom he has been given?
How does he perform such miracles?
3 Is he not the carpenter, the son of
Mary, the brother of James and Joses
6Mark 6.4–11
24
and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters
here with us? So they turned against
him.
4 Jesus said to them, A prophet never
lacks honour except in his home town,
among his relations and his own family.
5 And he was unable to do any miracle
there, except that he put his hands on a
few sick people and healed them;
6 and he was astonished at their want
of faith. AS HE went round the villages
teaching,
7 he summoned the Twelve and sent
them out two by two with authority over
unclean spirits.
8 He instructed them to take nothing for
the journey except a stick -- no bread,
no pack, no money in their belts.
9 They might wear sandals, but not a
second coat.
10 When you enter a house, he told
them, stay there until you leave that
district.
11 At any place where they will not
receive you or listen to you, shake the
dust off your feet as you leave, as a
solemn warning.Mark 6.12–20
25
12 So they set out and proclaimed the
need for repentance;
13 they drove out many demons, and
anointed many sick people with oil and
cured them.
14 Now King Herod heard of Jesus, for
his fame had spread, and people were
saying, John the Baptist has been raised
from the dead, and that is why these
miraculous powers are at work in him.
15 Others said, It is Elijah. Others again,
He is a prophet like one of the prophets
of old.
16 But when Herod heard of it, he said,
This is John, whom I beheaded, raised
from the dead.
17 It was this Herod who had sent men
to arrest John and put him in prison at
the instance of his brother Philip's wife,
Herodias, whom he had married.
18 John had told him, You have no right
to take your brother's wife.
19 Herodias nursed a grudge against
John and would willingly have killed him,
but she could not,
20 for Herod went in awe of him,
knowing him to be a good and holy man;
so he gave him his protection. He likedMark 6.21–27
26
to listen to him, although what he heard
left him greatly disturbed.
21 Herodias found her opportunity when
Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to
his chief officials and commanders and
the leading men of Galilee.
22 Her daughter came in and danced,
and so delighted Herod and his guests
that the king said to the girl, Ask me for
anything you like and I will give it to you.
23 He even said on oath: Whatever
you ask I will give you, up to half my
kingdom.
24 She went out and said to her mother,
What shall I ask for? She replied, The
head of John the Baptist.
25 The girl hurried straight back to the
king with her request: I want you to give
me, here and now, on a dish, the head
of John the Baptist.
26 The king was greatly distressed, yet
because of his oath and his guests he
could not bring himself to refuse her.
27 He sent a soldier of the guard with
orders to bring John's head; and the
soldier went to the prison and beheaded
him;Mark 6.28–35
27
28 then he brought the head on a dish,
and gave it to the girl; and she gave it
to her mother.
29 When John's disciples heard the
news, they came and took his body away
and laid it in a tomb.
30 THE apostles rejoined Jesus and
reported to him all that they had done
and taught.
31 He said to them, Come with me, by
yourselves, to some remote place and
rest a little. With many coming and going
they had no time even to eat.
32 So they set off by boat privately for a
remote place.
33 But many saw them leave and
recognized them, and people from all the
towns hurried round on foot and arrived
there first.
34 When he came ashore and saw a
large crowd, his heart went out to them,
because they were like sheep without a
shepherd; and he began to teach them
many things.
35 It was already getting late, and his
disciples came to him and said, This is a
remote place and it is already very late;Mark 6.36–45
28
36 send the people off to the farms and
villages round about, to buy themselves
something to eat.
37 Give them something to eat
yourselves, he answered. They replied,
Are we to go and spend two hundred
denarii to provide them with food?
38 How many loaves have you? he
asked. Go and see. They found out and
told him, Five, and two fish.
39 He ordered them to make the people
sit down in groups on the green grass,
40 and they sat down in rows, in
companies of fifty and a hundred.
41 Then, taking the five loaves and the
two fish, he looked up to heaven, said
the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave
them to the disciples to distribute. He
also divided the two fish among them.
42 They all ate and were satisfied;
43 and twelve baskets were filled with
what was left of the bread and the fish.
44 Those who ate the loaves numbered
five thousand men.
45 As soon as they had finished, he
made his disciples embark and cross to
Bethsaida ahead of him, while he himself
dismissed the crowd.Mark 6.46–54
29
46 After taking leave of them, he went
up the hill to pray.
47 It was now late and the boat was
already well out on the water, while he
was alone on the land.
48 Somewhere between three and six in
the morning, seeing them labouring at
the oars against a head wind, he came
towards them, walking on the lake. He
was going to pass by them;
49 but when they saw him walking on
the lake, they thought it was a ghost and
cried out;
50 for they all saw him and were
terrified. But at once he spoke to them:
Take heart! It is I; do not be afraid.
51 Then he climbed into the boat with
them, and the wind dropped. At this they
were utterly astounded,
52 for they had not understood the
incident of the loaves; their minds were
closed.
53 So they completed the crossing and
landed at Gennesaret, where they made
fast.
54 When they came ashore, he was
recognized at once;Mark 6.55–7.5
30
55 and the people scoured the whole
countryside and brought the sick on their
beds to any place where he was reported
to be.
56 Wherever he went, to village or
town or farm, they laid the sick in the
market-place and begged him to let
them simply touch the edge of his cloak;
and all who touched him were healed.
1 A GROUP of Pharisees, with
some scribes who had come from
Jerusalem, met him
2 and noticed that some of his disciples
were eating their food with defiled hands
-- in other words, without washing them.
3 (For Pharisees and Jews in general
never eat without washing their hands,
in obedience to ancient tradition;
4 and on coming from the market-place
they never eat without first washing.
And there are many other points on
which they maintain traditional rules, for
example in the washing of cups and jugs
and copper bowls.)
5 These Pharisees and scribes
questioned Jesus: Why do your disciples
not conform to the ancient tradition, but
eat their food with defiled hands?
7Mark 7.6–13
31
6 He answered, How right Isaiah
was when he prophesied about you
hypocrites in these words: This people
pays me lip-service, but their heart is far
from me:
7 they worship me in vain, for they
teach as doctrines the commandments
of men.
8 You neglect the commandment of
God, in order to maintain the tradition of
men.
9 He said to them, How clever you are
at setting aside the commandment of
God in order to maintain your tradition!
10 Moses said, Honour your father and
your mother, and again, Whoever curses
his father or mother shall be put to
death.
11 But you hold that if someone says
to his father or mother, Anything I have
which might have been used for your
benefit is Corban, (that is, set apart for
God)
12 he is no longer allowed to do anything
for his father or mother.
13 In this way by your tradition, handed
down among you, you make God's wordMark 7.14–21
32
null and void. And you do many other
things just like that.
14 On another occasion he called the
people and said to them, Listen to me,
all of you, and understand this:
15 nothing that goes into a person from
outside can defile him; no, it is the
things that come out of a person that
defile him.
16 [[EMPTY]]
17 When he had left the people and
gone indoors, his disciples questioned
him about the parable.
18 He said to them, Are you as dull as
the rest? Do you not see that nothing
that goes into a person from outside can
defile him,
19 because it does not go into the heart
but into the stomach, and so goes out
into the drain? By saying this he declared
all foods clean.
20 He went on, It is what comes out of a
person that defiles him.
21 From inside, from the human heart,
come evil thoughts, acts of fornication,
theft, murder,Mark 7.22–30
33
22 adultery, greed, and malice; fraud,
indecency, envy, slander, arrogance, and
folly;
23 all these evil things come from within,
and they are what defile a person.
24 He moved on from there into the
territory of Tyre. He found a house to
stay in, and would have liked to remain
unrecognized, but that was impossible.
25 Almost at once a woman whose small
daughter was possessed by an unclean
spirit heard of him and came and fell at
his feet.
26 (The woman was a Gentile, a
Phoenician of Syria by nationality.) She
begged him to drive the demon out of
her daughter.
27 He said to her, Let the children be
satisfied first; it is not right to take the
children's bread and throw it to the dogs.
28 Sir, she replied, even the dogs under
the table eat the children's scraps.
29 He said to her, For saying that, go,
and you will find the demon has left your
daughter.
30 And when she returned home, she
found the child lying in bed; the demon
had left her.Mark 7.31–8.1
34
31 On his journey back from Tyrian
territory he went by way of Sidon to the
sea of Galilee, well within the territory of
the Decapolis.
32 They brought to him a man who
was deaf and had an impediment in his
speech, and begged Jesus to lay his
hand on him.
33 He took him aside, away from the
crowd; then he put his fingers in the
man's ears, and touched his tongue with
spittle.
34 Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and
said to him, Ephphatha, which means Be
opened.
35 With that his hearing was restored,
and at the same time the impediment
was removed and he spoke clearly.
36 Jesus forbade them to tell anyone;
but the more he forbade them, the more
they spread it abroad.
37 Their astonishment knew no bounds:
All that he does, he does well, they said;
he even makes the deaf hear and the
dumb speak.
1 THERE was another occasion about
this time when a huge crowd had
collected, and, as they had no food,
8Mark 8.2–9
35
Jesus called his disciples and said to
them,
2 My heart goes out to these people;
they have been with me now for three
days and have nothing to eat.
3 If I send them home hungry, they will
faint on the way, and some of them have
a long way to go.
4 His disciples answered, How can
anyone provide these people with bread
in this remote place?
5 How many loaves have you? he asked;
and they answered, Seven.
6 So he ordered the people to sit
down on the ground; then he took the
seven loaves, and after giving thanks
to God he broke the bread and gave it
to his disciples to distribute; and they
distributed it to the people.
7 They had also a few small fish,
which he blessed and ordered them to
distribute.
8 They ate and were satisfied, and
seven baskets were filled with what was
left over.
9 The people numbered about four
thousand. Then he dismissed them,Mark 8.10–18
36
10 and at once got into the boat with
his disciples and went to the district of
Dalmanutha.
11 Then the Pharisees came out and
began to argue with him. To test him
they asked him for a sign from heaven.
12 He sighed deeply and said, Why does
this generation ask for a sign? Truly I
tell you: no sign shall be given to this
generation.
13 With that he left them, re-embarked,
and made for the other shore.
14 Now they had forgotten to take bread
with them, and had only one loaf in the
boat.
15 He began to warn them: Beware,
he said, be on your guard against the
leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven
of Herod.
16 So they began to talk among
themselves about having no bread.
17 Knowing this, he said to them, Why
are you talking about having no bread?
Have you no inkling yet? Do you still not
understand? Are your minds closed?
18 You have eyes: can you not see? You
have ears: can you not hear? Have you
forgotten?Mark 8.19–27
37
19 When I broke the five loaves among
five thousand, how many basketfuls of
pieces did you pick up? Twelve, they
said.
20 And how many when I broke the
seven loaves among four thousand?
Seven, they answered.
21 He said to them, Do you still not
understand?
22 They arrived at Bethsaida. There the
people brought a blind man to Jesus and
begged him to touch him.
23 He took the blind man by the hand
and led him out of the village. Then he
spat on his eyes, laid his hands upon
him, and asked whether he could see
anything.
24 The man's sight began to come back,
and he said, I see people -- they look
like trees, but they are walking about.
25 Jesus laid his hands on his eyes
again; he looked hard, and now he was
cured and could see everything clearly.
26 Then Jesus sent him home, saying,
Do not even go into the village.
27 JESUS and his disciples set out for
the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and onMark 8.28–34
38
the way he asked his disciples, Who do
people say I am?
28 They answered, Some say John the
Baptist, others Elijah, others one of the
prophets.
29 And you, he asked, who do you say I
am? Peter replied: You are the Messiah.
30 Then he gave them strict orders not
to tell anyone about him;
31 and he began to teach them that
the Son of Man had to endure great
suffering, and to be rejected by the
elders, chief priests, and scribes; to be
put to death, and to rise again three
days afterwards.
32 He spoke about it plainly. At this
Peter took hold of him and began to
rebuke him.
33 But Jesus, turning and looking at his
disciples, rebuked Peter. Out of my sight,
Satan! he said. You think as men think,
not as God thinks.
34 Then he called the people to him, as
well as his disciples, and said to them,
Anyone who wants to be a follower of
mine must renounce self; he must take
up his cross and follow me.Mark 8.35–9.5
39
35 Whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for my
sake and for the gospel's will save it.
36 What does anyone gain by winning
the whole world at the cost of his life?
37 What can he give to buy his life back?
38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my
words in this wicked and godless age,
the Son of Man will be ashamed of him,
when he comes in the glory of his Father
with the holy angels.
1 He said to them, Truly I tell you:
there are some of those standing
here who will not taste death before they
have seen the kingdom of God come
with power.
2 Six days later Jesus took Peter, James,
and John with him and led them up a
high mountain by themselves. And in
their presence he was transfigured;
3 his clothes became dazzling white,
with a whiteness no bleacher on earth
could equal.
4 They saw Elijah appear and Moses
with him, talking with Jesus.
5 Then Peter spoke: Rabbi, he said,
it is good that we are here! Shall we
9Mark 9.6–13
40
make three shelters, one for you, one
for Moses, and one for Elijah?
6 For he did not know what to say; they
were so terrified.
7 Then a cloud appeared, casting its
shadow over them, and out of the cloud
came a voice: This is my beloved Son;
listen to him.
8 And suddenly, when they looked
around, only Jesus was with them; there
was no longer anyone else to be seen.
9 On their way down the mountain, he
instructed them not to tell anyone what
they had seen until the Son of Man had
risen from the dead.
10 They seized upon those words, and
discussed among themselves what this
rising from the dead could mean.
11 And they put a question to him: Why
do the scribes say that Elijah must come
first?
12 He replied, Elijah does come first to
set everything right. How is it, then, that
the scriptures say of the Son of Man that
he is to endure great suffering and be
treated with contempt?
13 However, I tell you, Elijah has already
come and they have done to him whatMark 9.14–20
41
they wanted, as the scriptures say of
him.
14 When they came back to the disciples
they saw a large crowd surrounding
them and scribes arguing with them.
15 As soon as they saw Jesus the whole
crowd were overcome with awe and ran
forward to welcome him.
16 He asked them, What is this
argument about?
17 A man in the crowd spoke up:
Teacher, I brought my son for you to
cure. He is possessed by a spirit that
makes him dumb.
18 Whenever it attacks him, it flings
him to the ground, and he foams at the
mouth, grinds his teeth, and goes rigid.
I asked your disciples to drive it out, but
they could not.
19 Jesus answered: What an unbelieving
generation! How long shall I be with
you? How long must I endure you? Bring
him to me.
20 So they brought the boy to him; and
as soon as the spirit saw him it threw
the boy into convulsions, and he fell on
the ground and rolled about foaming at
the mouth.Mark 9.21–29
42
21 Jesus asked his father, How long has
he been like this? From childhood, he
replied;
22 it has often tried to destroy him by
throwing him into the fire or into water.
But if it is at all possible for you, take
pity on us and help us.
23 If it is possible! said Jesus. Everything
is possible to one who believes.
24 At once the boy's father cried: I
believe; help my unbelief.
25 When Jesus saw that the crowd was
closing in on them, he spoke sternly to
the unclean spirit. Deaf and dumb spirit,
he said, I command you, come out of
him and never go back!
26 It shrieked aloud and threw the boy
into repeated convulsions, and then
came out, leaving him looking like a
corpse; in fact, many said, He is dead.
27 But Jesus took hold of his hand and
raised him to his feet, and he stood up.
28 Then Jesus went indoors, and his
disciples asked him privately, Why could
we not drive it out?
29 He said, This kind cannot be driven
out except by prayer.Mark 9.30–37
43
30 THEY left that district and made their
way through Galilee. Jesus did not want
anyone to know,
31 because he was teaching his disciples,
and telling them, The Son of Man is now
to be handed over into the power of
men, and they will kill him; and three
days after being killed he will rise again.
32 But they did not understand what he
said, and were afraid to ask.
33 So they came to Capernaum; and
when he had gone indoors, he asked
them, What were you arguing about on
the way?
34 They were silent, because on the way
they had been discussing which of them
was the greatest.
35 So he sat down, called the Twelve,
and said to them, If anyone wants to be
first, he must make himself last of all
and servant of all.
36 Then he took a child, set him in front
of them, and put his arm round him.
37 Whoever receives a child like this in
my name, he said, receives me; and
whoever receives me, receives not me
but the One who sent me.Mark 9.38–46
44
38 John said to him, Teacher, we saw
someone driving out demons in your
name, and as he was not one of us, we
tried to stop him.
39 Jesus said, Do not stop him, for no
one who performs a miracle in my name
will be able the next moment to speak
evil of me.
40 He who is not against us is on our
side.
41 Truly I tell you: whoever gives you a
cup of water to drink because you are
followers of the Messiah will certainly not
go unrewarded.
42 If anyone causes the downfall of one
of these little ones who believe, it would
be better for him to be thrown into the
sea with a millstone round his neck.
43 If your hand causes your downfall,
cut it off; it is better for you to enter into
life maimed than to keep both hands and
go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.
44 [[EMPTY]]
45 If your foot causes your downfall,
cut it off; it is better to enter into life
crippled than to keep both your feet and
be thrown into hell.
46 [[EMPTY]]Mark 9.47–10.5
45
47 And if your eye causes your downfall,
tear it out; it is better to enter into the
kingdom of God with one eye than to
keep both eyes and be thrown into hell,
48 where the devouring worm never
dies and the fire is never quenched.
49 Everyone will be salted with fire.
50 Salt is good; but if the salt loses its
saltness, how will you season it? You
must have salt within yourselves, and be
at peace with one another.
1 ON leaving there he came
into the regions of Judaea
and Transjordan. Once again crowds
gathered round him, and he taught them
as was his practice.
2 He was asked: Is it lawful for a man to
divorce his wife? This question was put
to test him.
3 He responded by asking, What did
Moses command you?
4 They answered, Moses permitted a
man to divorce his wife by a certificate
of dismissal.
5 Jesus said to them, It was because
of your stubbornness that he made this
rule for you.
10Mark 10.6–16
46
6 But in the beginning, at the creation,
God made them male and female.
7 That is why a man leaves his father
and mother, and is united to his wife,
8 and the two become one flesh. It
follows that they are no longer two
individuals: they are one flesh.
9 Therefore what God has joined
together, man must not separate.
10 When they were indoors again, the
disciples questioned him about this.
11 He said to them, Whoever divorces
his wife and remarries commits adultery
against her;
12 so too, if she divorces her husband
and remarries, she commits adultery.
13 They brought children for him to
touch. The disciples rebuked them,
14 but when Jesus saw it he was
indignant, and said to them, Let the
children come to me; do not try to stop
them; for the kingdom of God belongs to
such as these.
15 Truly I tell you: whoever does not
accept the kingdom of God like a child
will never enter it.
16 And he put his arms round them, laid
his hands on them, and blessed them.Mark 10.17–23
47
17 As he was starting out on a journey,
a stranger ran up, and, kneeling before
him, asked, Good Teacher, what must I
do to win eternal life?
18 Jesus said to him, Why do you call
me good? No one is good except God
alone.
19 You know the commandments: Do
not murder; do not commit adultery; do
not steal; do not give false evidence;
do not defraud; honour your father and
mother.
20 But Teacher, he replied, I have kept
all these since I was a boy.
21 As Jesus looked at him, his heart
warmed to him. One thing you lack,
he said. Go, sell everything you have,
and give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven; then come and
follow me.
22 At these words his face fell and he
went away with a heavy heart; for he
was a man of great wealth.
23 Jesus looked round at his disciples
and said to them, How hard it will be
for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of
God!Mark 10.24–32
48
24 They were amazed that he should say
this, but Jesus insisted, Children, how
hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
26 They were more astonished than
ever, and said to one another, Then who
can be saved?
27 Jesus looked at them and said, For
men it is impossible, but not for God;
everything is possible for God.
28 What about us? said Peter. We have
left everything to follow you.
29 Jesus said, Truly I tell you: there is
no one who has given up home, brothers
or sisters, mother, father or children, or
land, for my sake and for the gospel,
30 who will not receive in this age
a hundred times as much -- houses,
brothers and sisters, mothers and
children, and land -- and persecutions
besides; and in the age to come eternal
life.
31 But many who are first will be last,
and the last first.
32 THEY were on the road going up to
Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading theMark 10.33–39
49
way; and the disciples were filled with
awe, while those who followed behind
were afraid. Once again he took the
Twelve aside and began to tell them
what was to happen to him.
33 We are now going up to Jerusalem,
he said, and the Son of Man will be
handed over to the chief priests and the
scribes; they will condemn him to death
and hand him over to the Gentiles.
34 He will be mocked and spat upon,
and flogged and killed; and three days
afterwards, he will rise again.
35 James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
approached him and said, Teacher, we
should like you to do us a favour.
36 What is it you want me to do for you?
he asked.
37 They answered, Allow us to sit with
you in your glory, one at your right hand
and the other at your left.
38 Jesus said to them, You do not
understand what you are asking. Can
you drink the cup that I drink, or be
baptized with the baptism I am baptized
with?
39 We can, they answered. Jesus said,
The cup that I drink you shall drink, andMark 10.40–46
50
the baptism I am baptized with shall be
your baptism;
40 but to sit on my right or on my left
is not for me to grant; that honour is
for those to whom it has already been
assigned.
41 When the other ten heard this, they
were indignant with James and John.
42 Jesus called them to him and said,
You know that among the Gentiles
the recognized rulers lord it over their
subjects, and the great make their
authority felt.
43 It shall not be so with you; among
you, whoever wants to be great must be
your servant,
44 and whoever wants to be first must
be the slave of all.
45 For the Son of Man did not come to
be served but to serve, and to give his
life as a ransom for many.
46 They came to Jericho; and as he was
leaving the town, with his disciples and
a large crowd, Bartimaeus (that is, son
of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was seated
at the roadside.Mark 10.47–11.2
51
47 Hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth,
he began to shout, Son of David, Jesus,
have pity on me!
48 Many of the people told him to hold
his tongue; but he shouted all the more,
Son of David, have pity on me.
49 Jesus stopped and said, Call him; so
they called the blind man: Take heart,
they said. Get up; he is calling you.
50 At that he threw off his cloak, jumped
to his feet, and came to Jesus.
51 Jesus said to him, What do you want
me to do for you? Rabbi, the blind man
answered, I want my sight back.
52 Jesus said to him, Go; your faith has
healed you. And at once he recovered
his sight and followed him on the road.
1 THEY were now approaching
Jerusalem, and when they
reached Bethphage and Bethany, close
by the mount of Olives, he sent off two
of his disciples.
2 Go into the village opposite, he told
them, and just as you enter you will find
tethered there a colt which no one has
yet ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
11Mark 11.3–11
52
3 If anyone asks why you are doing this,
say, The Master needs it, and will send it
back here without delay.
4 So they went off, and found the colt
outside in the street, tethered beside a
door. As they were untying it,
5 some of the bystanders asked, What
are you doing, untying that colt?
6 They answered as Jesus had told
them, and were then allowed to take it.
7 So they brought the colt to Jesus, and
when they had spread their cloaks on it
he mounted it.
8 Many people carpeted the road
with their cloaks, while others spread
greenery which they had cut in the
fields;
9 and those in front and those behind
shouted, Hosanna! Blessed is he who
comes in the name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is the kingdom of our father
David which is coming! Hosanna in the
heavens!
11 He entered Jerusalem and went
into the temple. He looked round at
everything; then, as it was already late,
he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.Mark 11.12–18
53
12 On the following day, as they left
Bethany, he felt hungry,
13 and, noticing in the distance a fig
tree in leaf, he went to see if he could
find anything on it. But when he reached
it he found nothing but leaves; for it was
not the season for figs.
14 He said to the tree, May no one
ever again eat fruit from you! And his
disciples were listening.
15 So they came to Jerusalem, and he
went into the temple and began to drive
out those who bought and sold there. He
upset the tables of the money-changers
and the seats of the dealers in pigeons;
16 and he would not allow anyone to
carry goods through the temple court.
17 Then he began to teach them, and
said, Does not scripture say, My house
shall be called a house of prayer for all
nations? But you have made it a robbers
cave.'
18 The chief priests and the scribes
heard of this and looked for a way to
bring about his death; for they were
afraid of him, because the whole crowd
was spellbound by his teaching.Mark 11.19–27
54
19 And when evening came they went
out of the city.
20 Early next morning, as they passed
by, they saw that the fig tree had
withered from the roots up;
21 and Peter, recalling what had
happened, said to him, Rabbi, look, the
fig tree which you cursed has withered.
22 Jesus answered them, Have faith in
God.
23 Truly I tell you: if anyone says to this
mountain, Be lifted from your place and
hurled into the sea, and has no inward
doubts, but believes that what he says
will happen, it will be done for him.
24 I tell you, then, whatever you ask for
in prayer, believe that you have received
it and it will be yours.
25 And when you stand praying, if you
have a grievance against anyone, forgive
him, so that your Father in heaven may
forgive you the wrongs you have done.
26 [[EMPTY]]
27 THEY came once more to Jerusalem.
And as he was walking in the temple
court the chief priests, scribes, and
elders came to himMark 11.28–12.2
55
28 and said, By what authority are you
acting like this? Who gave you authority
to act in this way?
29 Jesus said to them, I also have a
question for you, and if you give me an
answer, I will tell you by what authority I
act.
30 The baptism of John: was it from
God, or from men? Answer me.
31 This set them arguing among
themselves: What shall we say? If we
say, From God, he will say, Then why did
you not believe him?
32 Shall we say, From men? -- but they
were afraid of the people, for all held
that John was in fact a prophet.
33 So they answered, We do not know.
And Jesus said to them, Then I will not
tell you either by what authority I act.
1 He went on to speak to them
in parables: A man planted a
vineyard and put a wall round it, hewed
out a winepress, and built a watch-tower;
then he let it out to vine-growers and
went abroad.
2 When the season came, he sent a
servant to the tenants to collect from
them his share of the produce.
12Mark 12.3–12
56
3 But they seized him, thrashed him,
and sent him away empty-handed.
4 Again, he sent them another servant,
whom they beat about the head and
treated outrageously,
5 and then another, whom they killed.
He sent many others and they thrashed
some and killed the rest.
6 He had now no one left to send except
his beloved son, and in the end he sent
him. They will respect my son, he said;
7 but the tenants said to one another,
This is the heir; come on, let us kill him,
and the inheritance will be ours.
8 So they seized him and killed him, and
flung his body out of the vineyard.
9 What will the owner of the vineyard
do? He will come and put the tenants to
death and give the vineyard to others.
10 Have you never read this text: The
stone which the builders rejected has
become the main corner-stone.
11 This is the Lord's doing, and it is
wonderful in our eyes?
12 They saw that the parable was aimed
at them and wanted to arrest him; but
they were afraid of the people, so they
left him alone and went away.Mark 12.13–19
57
13 A NUMBER of Pharisees and men of
Herod's party were sent to trap him with
a question.
14 They came and said, Teacher, we
know you are a sincere man and court
no one's favour, whoever he may be;
you teach in all sincerity the way of life
that God requires. Are we or are we not
permitted to pay taxes to the Roman
emperor?
15 Shall we pay or not? He saw through
their duplicity, and said, Why are you
trying to catch me out? Fetch me a silver
piece, and let me look at it.
16 They brought one, and he asked
them, Whose head is this, and whose
inscription? Caesar's, they replied.
17 Then Jesus said, Pay Caesar what
belongs to Caesar, and God what belongs
to God. His reply left them completely
taken aback.
18 Next Sadducees, who maintain that
there is no resurrection, came to him
and asked:
19 Teacher, Moses laid it down for us
that if there are brothers, and one dies
leaving a wife but no child, then the nextMark 12.20–28
58
should marry the widow and provide an
heir for his brother.
20 Now there were seven brothers. The
first took a wife and died without issue.
21 Then the second married her, and he
too died without issue; so did the third;
22 none of the seven left any issue.
Finally the woman died.
23 At the resurrection, when they rise
from the dead, whose wife will she be,
since all seven had married her?
24 Jesus said to them, How far you are
from the truth! You know neither the
scriptures nor the power of God.
25 When they rise from the dead, men
and women do not marry; they are like
angels in heaven.
26 As for the resurrection of the dead,
have you not read in the book of Moses,
in the story of the burning bush, how
God spoke to him and said, I am the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God
of Jacob?
27 He is not God of the dead but of the
living. You are very far from the truth.
28 Then one of the scribes, who had
been listening to these discussions and
had observed how well Jesus answered,Mark 12.29–35
59
came forward and asked him, Which is
the first of all the commandments?
29 He answered, The first is, Hear, O
Israel: the Lord our God is the one Lord,
30 and you must love the Lord your God
with all your heart, with all your soul,
with all your mind, and with all your
strength.
31 The second is this: You must love
your neighbour as yourself. No other
commandment is greater than these.
32 The scribe said to him, Well said,
Teacher. You are right in saying that God
is one and beside him there is no other.
33 And to love him with all your heart,
all your understanding, and all your
strength, and to love your neighbour as
yourself -- that means far more than any
whole-offerings and sacrifices.
34 When Jesus saw how thoughtfully he
answered, he said to him, You are not
far from the kingdom of God. After that
nobody dared put any more questions to
him.
35 As he taught in the temple, Jesus
went on to say, How can the scribes
maintain that the Messiah is a son of
David?Mark 12.36–43
60
36 It was David himself who said, when
inspired by the Holy Spirit, The Lord said
to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I
put your enemies under your feet.
37 David himself calls him Lord; how can
he be David's son?' There was a large
crowd listening eagerly.
38 As he taught them, he said, Beware
of the scribes, who love to walk up
and down in long robes and be greeted
respectfully in the street,
39 to have the chief seats in synagogues
and places of honour at feasts.
40 Those who eat up the property of
widows, while for appearance sake they
say long prayers, will receive a sentence
all the more severe.'
41 As he was sitting opposite the
temple treasury, he watched the people
dropping their money into the chest.
Many rich people were putting in large
amounts.
42 Presently there came a poor widow
who dropped in two tiny coins, together
worth a penny.
43 He called his disciples to him and
said, Truly I tell you: this poor widowMark 12.44–13.7
61
has given more than all those giving to
the treasury;
44 for the others who have given had
more than enough, but she, with less
than enough, has given all that she had
to live on.
1 AS HE was leaving the temple,
one of his disciples exclaimed,
Look, Teacher, what huge stones! What
fine buildings!
2 Jesus said to him, You see these great
buildings? Not one stone will be left upon
another; they will all be thrown down.
3 As he sat on the mount of Olives
opposite the temple he was questioned
privately by Peter, James, John, and
Andrew.
4 Tell us, they said, when will this
happen? What will be the sign that all
these things are about to be fulfilled?
5 Jesus began: Be on your guard; let no
one mislead you.
6 Many will come claiming my name,
and saying, I am he; and many will be
misled by them.
7 When you hear of wars and rumours
of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things
13Mark 13.8–13
62
are bound to happen; but the end is still
to come.
8 For nation will go to war against
nation, kingdom against kingdom; there
will be earthquakes in many places;
there will be famines. These are the first
birth-pangs of the new age.
9 As for you, be on your guard. You will
be handed over to the courts; you will
be beaten in synagogues; you will be
summoned to appear before governors
and kings on my account to testify in
their presence.
10 Before the end the gospel must be
proclaimed to all nations.
11 So when you are arrested and put on
trial do not worry beforehand about what
you will say, but when the time comes
say whatever is given you to say, for it
is not you who will be speaking, but the
Holy Spirit.
12 Brother will hand over brother to
death, and a father his child; children
will turn against their parents and send
them to their death.
13 Everyone will hate you for your
allegiance to me, but whoever endures
to the end will be saved.Mark 13.14–22
63
14 But when you see the abomination
of desolation usurping a place which is
not his (let the reader understand), then
those who are in Judaea must take to
the hills.
15 If anyone is on the roof, he must not
go down into the house to fetch anything
out;
16 if anyone is in the field, he must not
turn back for his coat.
17 Alas for women with child in those
days, and for those who have children at
the breast!
18 Pray that it may not come in winter.
19 For those days will bring distress
such as there has never been before
since the beginning of the world which
God created, and will never be again.
20 If the Lord had not cut short that
time of troubles, no living thing could
survive. However, for the sake of his
own, whom he has chosen, he has cut
short the time.
21 If anyone says to you then, Look,
here is the Messiah, or, Look, there he
is, do not believe it.
22 Impostors will come claiming to be
messiahs or prophets, and they willMark 13.23–31
64
produce signs and wonders to mislead, if
possible, God's chosen.
23 Be on your guard; I have forewarned
you of it all.
24 But in those days, after that distress,
the sun will be darkened, the moon will
not give her light;
25 the stars will come falling from the
sky, the celestial powers will be shaken.
26 Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds with great power
and glory,
27 and he will send out the angels and
gather his chosen from the four winds,
from the farthest bounds of earth to the
farthest bounds of heaven.
28 Learn a lesson from the fig tree.
When its tender shoots appear and
are breaking into leaf, you know that
summer is near.
29 In the same way, when you see all
this happening, you may know that the
end is near, at the very door.
30 Truly I tell you: the present
generation will live to see it all.
31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.Mark 13.32–14.2
65
32 Yet about that day or hour no one
knows, not even the angels in heaven,
not even the Son; no one but the Father.
33 Be on your guard, keep watch. You do
not know when the moment is coming.
34 It is like a man away from home: he
has left his house and put his servants in
charge, each with his own work to do,
and he has ordered the door-keeper to
stay awake.
35 Keep awake, then, for you do not
know when the master of the house will
come. Evening or midnight, cock-crow or
early dawn --
36 if he comes suddenly, do not let him
find you asleep.
37 And what I say to you, I say to
everyone: Keep awake.
1 IT was two days before
the festival of Passover and
Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests
and the scribes were trying to devise
some scheme to seize him and put him
to death.
2 It must not be during the festival, they
said, or we should have rioting among
the people.
14Mark 14.3–10
66
3 Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of
Simon the leper. As he sat at table, a
woman came in carrying a bottle of very
costly perfume, pure oil of nard. She
broke it open and poured the oil over his
head.
4 Some of those present said indignantly
to one another, Why this waste?
5 The perfume might have been sold for
more than three hundred denarii and
the money given to the poor; and they
began to scold her.
6 But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why
make trouble for her? It is a fine thing
she has done for me.
7 You have the poor among you always,
and you can help them whenever you
like; but you will not always have me.
8 She has done what lay in her power;
she has anointed my body in anticipation
of my burial.
9 Truly I tell you: wherever the gospel
is proclaimed throughout the world,
what she has done will be told as her
memorial.
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the
Twelve, went to the chief priests to
betray him to them.Mark 14.11–17
67
11 When they heard what he had come
for, they were glad and promised him
money; and he began to look for an
opportunity to betray him.
12 NOW ON the first day of Unleavened
Bread, when the Passover lambs were
being slaughtered, his disciples said to
him, Where would you like us to go and
prepare the Passover for you?
13 So he sent off two of his disciples
with these instructions: Go into the city,
and a man will meet you carrying a jar
of water. Follow him,
14 and when he enters a house give
this message to the householder: The
Teacher says, Where is the room in
which I am to eat the Passover with my
disciples?
15 He will show you a large upstairs
room, set out in readiness. Make the
preparations for us there.'
16 Then the disciples went off, and
when they came into the city they found
everything just as he had told them. So
they prepared the Passover.
17 In the evening he came to the house
with the Twelve.Mark 14.18–25
68
18 As they sat at supper Jesus said,
Truly I tell you: one of you will betray
me -- one who is eating with me.
19 At this they were distressed; and one
by one they said to him, Surely you do
not mean me?
20 It is one of the Twelve, he said, who
is dipping into the bowl with me.
21 The Son of Man is going the way
appointed for him in the scriptures; but
alas for that man by whom the Son of
Man is betrayed! It would be better for
that man if he had never been born.
22 During supper he took bread, and
having said the blessing he broke it and
gave it to them, with the words: Take
this; this is my body.
23 Then he took a cup, and having
offered thanks to God he gave it to
them; and they all drank from it.
24 And he said to them, This is my
blood, the blood of the covenant, shed
for many.
25 Truly I tell you: never again shall I
drink from the fruit of the vine until that
day when I drink it new in the kingdom
of God.Mark 14.26–35
69
26 After singing the Passover hymn,
they went out to the mount of Olives.
27 And Jesus said to them, You will all
lose faith; for it is written: I will strike
the shepherd and the sheep will be
scattered.
28 Nevertheless, after I am raised I shall
go ahead of you into Galilee.
29 Peter answered, Everyone else may
lose faith, but I will not.
30 Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you:
today, this very night, before the cock
crows twice, you yourself will disown me
three times.
31 But Peter insisted: Even if I have to
die with you, I will never disown you.
And they all said the same.
32 WHEN they reached a place called
Gethsemane, he said to his disciples, Sit
here while I pray.
33 And he took Peter and James and
John with him. Horror and anguish
overwhelmed him,
34 and he said to them, My heart is
ready to break with grief; stop here, and
stay awake.
35 Then he went on a little farther, threw
himself on the ground, and prayed thatMark 14.36–43
70
if it were possible this hour might pass
him by.
36 Abba, Father, he said, all things are
possible to you; take this cup from me.
Yet not my will but yours.
37 He came back and found them
asleep; and he said to Peter, Asleep,
Simon? Could you not stay awake for
one hour?
38 Stay awake, all of you; and pray that
you may be spared the test. The spirit is
willing, but the flesh is weak.
39 Once more he went away and prayed.
40 On his return he found them asleep
again, for their eyes were heavy; and
they did not know how to answer him.
41 He came a third time and said to
them, Still asleep? Still resting? Enough!
The hour has come. The Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 Up, let us go! The traitor is upon us.
43 He was still speaking when Judas, one
of the Twelve, appeared, and with him a
crowd armed with swords and cudgels,
sent by the chief priests, scribes, and
elders.Mark 14.44–53
71
44 Now the traitor had agreed with them
on a signal: The one I kiss is your man;
seize him and get him safely away.
45 When he reached the spot, he went
straight up to him and said, Rabbi, and
kissed him.
46 Then they seized him and held him
fast.
47 One of the bystanders drew his
sword, and struck the high priest's
servant, cutting off his ear.
48 Then Jesus spoke: Do you take me
for a robber, that you have come out
with swords and cudgels to arrest me?
49 Day after day I have been among you
teaching in the temple, and you did not
lay hands on me. But let the scriptures
be fulfilled.
50 Then the disciples all deserted him
and ran away.
51 Among those who had followed Jesus
was a young man with nothing on but a
linen cloth. They tried to seize him;
52 but he slipped out of the linen cloth
and ran away naked.
53 THEN they led Jesus away to the high
priest's house, where the chief priests,
elders, and scribes were all assembling.Mark 14.54–61
72
54 Peter followed him at a distance right
into the high priest's courtyard; and
there he remained, sitting among the
attendants and warming himself at the
fire.
55 The chief priests and the whole
Council tried to find evidence against
Jesus that would warrant a death
sentence, but failed to find any.
56 Many gave false evidence against
him, but their statements did not tally.
57 Some stood up and gave false
evidence against him to this effect:
58 We heard him say, I will pull down
this temple, made with human hands,
and in three days I will build another, not
made with hands.
59 But even on this point their evidence
did not agree.
60 Then the high priest rose to his feet
and questioned Jesus: Have you no
answer to the accusations that these
witnesses bring against you?
61 But he remained silent and made no
reply. Again the high priest questioned
him: Are you the Messiah, the Son of the
Blessed One?Mark 14.62–69
73
62 I am, said Jesus; and you will see the
Son of Man seated at the right hand of
the Almighty and coming with the clouds
of heaven.
63 Then the high priest tore his robes
and said, Do we need further witnesses?
64 You have heard the blasphemy. What
is your decision? Their judgement was
unanimous: that he was guilty and
should be put to death.
65 Some began to spit at him; they
blindfolded him and struck him with
their fists, crying out, Prophesy! And the
attendants slapped him in the face.
66 Meanwhile Peter was still below in
the courtyard. One of the high priest's
servant-girls came by
67 and saw him there warming himself.
She looked closely at him and said, You
were with this man from Nazareth, this
Jesus.
68 But he denied it: I know nothing,
he said; I have no idea what you are
talking about, and he went out into the
forecourt.
69 The servant-girl saw him there and
began to say again to the bystanders,
He is one of them;Mark 14.70–15.5
74
70 and again he denied it. Again, a little
later, the bystanders said to Peter, You
must be one of them; you are a Galilean.
71 At this he started to curse, and
declared with an oath, I do not know this
man you are talking about.
72 At that moment the cock crowed for
the second time; and Peter remembered
how Jesus had said to him, Before the
cock crows twice, you will disown me
three times. And he burst into tears.
1 AS SOON as morning came,
the whole Council, chief priests,
elders, and scribes, made their plans.
They bound Jesus and led him away to
hand him over to Pilate.
2 Are you the king of the Jews? Pilate
asked him. The words are yours, he
replied.
3 And the chief priests brought many
charges against him.
4 Pilate questioned him again: Have you
nothing to say in your defence? You see
how many charges they are bringing
against you.
5 But, to Pilate's astonishment, Jesus
made no further reply.
15Mark 15.6–15
75
6 At the festival season the governor
used to release one prisoner requested
by the people.
7 As it happened, a man known as
Barabbas was then in custody with the
rebels who had committed murder in the
rising.
8 When the crowd appeared and began
asking for the usual favour,
9 Pilate replied, Would you like me to
release the king of the Jews?
10 For he knew it was out of malice that
Jesus had been handed over to him.
11 But the chief priests incited the
crowd to ask instead for the release of
Barabbas.
12 Pilate spoke to them again: Then
what shall I do with the man you call
king of the Jews?
13 They shouted back, Crucify him!
14 Why, what wrong has he done? Pilate
asked; but they shouted all the louder,
Crucify him!
15 So Pilate, in his desire to satisfy the
mob, released Barabbas to them; and he
had Jesus flogged, and then handed him
over to be crucified.Mark 15.16–24
76
16 The soldiers took him inside the
governor's residence, the Praetorium,
and called the whole company together.
17 They dressed him in purple and,
plaiting a crown of thorns, placed it on
his head.
18 Then they began to salute him: Hail,
king of the Jews!
19 They beat him about the head with a
stick and spat at him, and then knelt and
paid homage to him.
20 When they had finished their
mockery, they stripped off the purple
robe and dressed him in his own clothes.
THEN they led him out to crucify him.
21 A man called Simon, from Cyrene,
the father of Alexander and Rufus,
was passing by on his way in from the
country, and they pressed him into
service to carry his cross.
22 They brought Jesus to the place
called Golgotha, which means Place of a
Skull,
23 and they offered him drugged wine,
but he did not take it.
24 Then they fastened him to the cross.
They shared out his clothes, casting lots
to decide what each should have.Mark 15.25–34
77
25 It was nine in the morning when they
crucified him;
26 and the inscription giving the charge
against him read, The King of the Jews.
27 Two robbers were crucified with him,
one on his right and the other on his left.
28 [[EMPTY]]
29 The passers-by wagged their heads
and jeered at him: Bravo! they cried, So
you are the man who was to pull down
the temple, and rebuild it in three days!
30 Save yourself and come down from
the cross.
31 The chief priests and scribes joined
in, jesting with one another: He saved
others, they said, but he cannot save
himself.
32 Let the Messiah, the king of Israel,
come down now from the cross. If we
see that, we shall believe. Even those
who were crucified with him taunted
him.
33 At midday a darkness fell over the
whole land, which lasted till three in the
afternoon;
34 and at three Jesus cried aloud, Eloi,
Eloi, lema sabachthani? which means,Mark 15.35–43
78
My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?
35 Hearing this, some of the bystanders
said, Listen! He is calling Elijah.
36 Someone ran and soaked a sponge
in sour wine and held it to his lips on
the end of a stick. Let us see, he said, if
Elijah will come to take him down.
37 Then Jesus gave a loud cry and died;
38 and the curtain of the temple was
torn in two from top to bottom.
39 When the centurion who was standing
opposite him saw how he died, he said,
This man must have been a son of God.
40 A NUMBER of women were also
present, watching from a distance.
Among them were Mary of Magdala,
Mary the mother of James the younger
and of Joses, and Salome,
41 who had all followed him and looked
after him when he was in Galilee, and
there were many others who had come
up to Jerusalem with him.
42 By this time evening had come; and
as it was the day of preparation (that is,
the day before the sabbath),
43 Joseph of Arimathaea, a respected
member of the Council, a man whoMark 15.44–16.3
79
looked forward to the kingdom of God,
bravely went in to Pilate and asked for
the body of Jesus.
44 Pilate was surprised to hear that
he had died so soon, and sent for the
centurion to make sure that he was
already dead.
45 And when he heard the centurion's
report, he gave Joseph leave to take the
body.
46 So Joseph bought a linen sheet, took
him down from the cross, and wrapped
him in the sheet. Then he laid him in a
tomb cut out of the rock, and rolled a
stone against the entrance.
47 And Mary of Magdala and Mary the
mother of Joses were watching and saw
where he was laid.
1 WHEN the sabbath was over,
Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother
of James, and Salome bought aromatic
oils, intending to go and anoint him;
2 and very early on the first day of the
week, just after sunrise, they came to
the tomb.
3 They were wondering among
themselves who would roll away the
16Mark 16.4–8
80
stone for them from the entrance to the
tomb,
4 when they looked up and saw that the
stone, huge as it was, had been rolled
back already.
5 They went into the tomb, where
they saw a young man sitting on the
right-hand side, wearing a white robe;
and they were dumbfounded.
6 But he said to them, Do not be
alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of
Nazareth, who was crucified. He has
been raised; he is not here. Look, there
is the place where they laid him.
7 But go and say to his disciples and
to Peter: He is going ahead of you into
Galilee: there you will see him, as he
told you.
8 Then they went out and ran away from
the tomb, trembling with amazement.
They said nothing to anyone, for they
were afraid. [AND they delivered all
these instructions briefly to Peter and his
companions. Afterwards Jesus himself
sent out by them, from east to west,
the sacred and imperishable message of
eternal salvation.]Mark 16.9–16
81
9 [WHEN he had risen from the dead,
early on the first day of the week, he
appeared first to Mary of Magdala, from
whom he had driven out seven demons.]
10 [She went and carried the news to
his mourning and sorrowful followers,]
11 [but when they were told that he was
alive and that she had seen him they did
not believe it.]
12 [Later he appeared in a different form
to two of them while they were on their
way into the country.]
13 [These also went and took the news
to the others, but again no one believed
them.]
14 [Still later he appeared to the eleven
while they were at table, and reproached
them for their incredulity and dullness,
because they had not believed those
who had seen him after he was raised
from the dead.]
15 [Then he said to them: Go to every
part of the world, and proclaim the
gospel to the whole creation.]
16 [Those who believe it and receive
baptism will be saved; those who do not
believe will be condemned.]Mark 16.17–20
82
17 [Faith will bring with it these miracles:
believers will drive out demons in my
name and speak in strange tongues;]
18 [if they handle snakes or drink any
deadly poison, they will come to no
harm; and the sick on whom they lay
their hands will recover.]
19 [So after talking with them the Lord
Jesus was taken up into heaven and took
his seat at the right hand of God;]
20 [but they went out to proclaim their
message far and wide, and the Lord
worked with them and confirmed their
words by the miracles that followed.]Luke
1 TO THEOPHILUS: Many writers have
1 undertaken to draw up an account of
the events that have taken place among
us,
2 following the traditions handed down
to us by the original eyewitnesses and
servants of the gospel.
3 So I in my turn, as one who has
investigated the whole course of these
events in detail, have decided to write
an orderly narrative for you, your
excellency,
4 so as to give you authentic knowledge
about the matters of which you have
been informed.
5 IN the reign of Herod king of Judaea
there was a priest named Zechariah,
of the division of the priesthood called
after Abijah. His wife, whose name was
Elizabeth, was also of priestly descent.
6 Both of them were upright and
devout, blamelessly observing all the
commandments and ordinances of the
Lord.Luke 1.7–15
2
7 But they had no children, for Elizabeth
was barren, and both were well on in
years.
8 Once, when it was the turn of his
division and he was there to take part in
the temple service,
9 he was chosen by lot, by priestly
custom, to enter the sanctuary of the
Lord and offer the incense;
10 and at the hour of the offering the
people were all assembled at prayer
outside.
11 There appeared to him an angel of
the Lord, standing on the right of the
altar of incense.
12 At this sight, Zechariah was startled
and overcome by fear.
13 But the angel said to him, Do not be
afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been
heard: your wife Elizabeth will bear you
a son, and you are to name him John.
14 His birth will fill you with joy and
delight, and will bring gladness to many;
15 for he will be great in the eyes of the
Lord. He is never to touch wine or strong
drink. From his very birth he will be filled
with the Holy Spirit;Luke 1.16–22
3
16 and he will bring back many Israelites
to the Lord their God.
17 He will go before him as forerunner,
possessed by the spirit and power of
Elijah, to reconcile father and child, to
convert the rebellious to the ways of the
righteous, to prepare a people that shall
be fit for the Lord.
18 Zechariah said to the angel, How can
I be sure of this? I am an old man and
my wife is well on in years.
19 The angel replied, I am Gabriel; I
stand in attendance on God, and I have
been sent to speak to you and bring you
this good news.
20 But now, because you have not
believed me, you will lose all power of
speech and remain silent until the day
when these things take place; at their
proper time my words will be proved
true.
21 Meanwhile the people were waiting
for Zechariah, surprised that he was
staying so long inside the sanctuary.
22 When he did come out he could not
speak to them, and they realized that he
had had a vision. He stood there making
signs to them, and remained dumb.Luke 1.23–32
4
23 When his period of duty was
completed Zechariah returned home.
24 His wife Elizabeth conceived, and
for five months she lived in seclusion,
thinking,
25 This is the Lord's doing; now at last
he has shown me favour and taken away
from me the disgrace of childlessness.
26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel
was sent by God to Nazareth, a town in
Galilee,
27 with a message for a girl betrothed to
a man named Joseph, a descendant of
David; the girl's name was Mary.
28 The angel went in and said to her,
Greetings, most favoured one! The Lord
is with you.
29 But she was deeply troubled by what
he said and wondered what this greeting
could mean.
30 Then the angel said to her, Do not be
afraid, Mary, for God has been gracious
to you;
31 you will conceive and give birth to a
son, and you are to give him the name
Jesus.
32 He will be great, and will be called
Son of the Most High. The Lord GodLuke 1.33–41
5
will give him the throne of his ancestor
David,
33 and he will be king over Israel for
ever; his reign shall never end.
34 How can this be? said Mary. I am still
a virgin.
35 The angel answered, The Holy Spirit
will come upon you, and the power of
the Most High will overshadow you; for
that reason the holy child to be born will
be called Son of God.
36 Moreover your kinswoman Elizabeth
has herself conceived a son in her old
age; and she who is reputed barren is
now in her sixth month,
37 for God's promises can never fail.
38 I am the Lord's servant, said Mary;
may it be as you have said. Then the
angel left her.
39 Soon afterwards Mary set out and
hurried away to a town in the uplands of
Judah.
40 She went into Zechariah's house and
greeted Elizabeth.
41 And when Elizabeth heard Mary's
greeting, the baby stirred in her womb.
Then Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
SpiritLuke 1.42–51
6
42 and exclaimed in a loud voice, God's
blessing is on you above all women, and
his blessing is on the fruit of your womb.
43 Who am I, that the mother of my
Lord should visit me?
44 I tell you, when your greeting
sounded in my ears, the baby in my
womb leapt for joy.
45 Happy is she who has had faith that
the Lord's promise to her would be
fulfilled!
46 And Mary said: My soul tells out the
greatness of the Lord,
47 my spirit has rejoiced in God my
Saviour;
48 for he has looked with favour on his
servant, lowly as she is. From this day
forward all generations will count me
blessed,
49 for the Mighty God has done great
things for me. His name is holy,
50 his mercy sure from generation to
generation toward those who fear him.
51 He has shown the might of his arm,
he has routed the proud and all their
schemes;Luke 1.52–62
7
52 he has brought down monarchs from
their thrones, and raised on high the
lowly.
53 He has filled the hungry with good
things, and sent the rich away empty.
54 He has come to the help of Israel
his servant, as he promised to our
forefathers; he has not forgotten to show
mercy to Abraham and his children's
children for ever.
55 (1:54)
56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about
three months and then returned home.
57 WHEN the time came for Elizabeth's
child to be born, she gave birth to a son.
58 Her neighbours and relatives heard
what great kindness the Lord had shown
her, and they shared her delight.
59 On the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child; and they were
going to name him Zechariah after his
father,
60 but his mother spoke up: No! she
said. He is to be called John.
61 But, they said, there is nobody in
your family who has that name.
62 They enquired of his father by signs
what he would like him to be called.Luke 1.63–71
8
63 He asked for a writing tablet and to
everybody's astonishment wrote, His
name is John.
64 Immediately his lips and tongue were
freed and he began to speak, praising
God.
65 All the neighbours were overcome
with awe, and throughout the uplands of
Judaea the whole story became common
talk.
66 All who heard it were deeply
impressed and said, What will this child
become? For indeed the hand of the Lord
was upon him.
67 And Zechariah his father was filled
with the Holy Spirit and uttered this
prophecy:
68 Praise to the Lord, the God of Israel!
For he has turned to his people and set
them free.
69 He has raised for us a strong deliverer
from the house of his servant David.
70 So he promised: age after age
he proclaimed by the lips of his holy
prophets,
71 that he would deliver us from our
enemies, out of the hands of all who
hate us;Luke 1.72–80
9
72 that, calling to mind his solemn
covenant, he would deal mercifully with
our fathers.
73 This was the oath he swore to our
father Abraham,
74 to rescue us from enemy hands and
set us free from fear, so that we might
worship
75 in his presence in holiness and
righteousness our whole life long.
76 And you, my child, will be called
Prophet of the Most High, for you will be
the Lord's forerunner, to prepare his way
77 and lead his people to a knowledge
of salvation through the forgiveness of
their sins:
78 for in the tender compassion of our
God the dawn from heaven will break
upon us,
79 to shine on those who live in
darkness, under the shadow of death,
and to guide our feet into the way of
peace.
80 As the child grew up he became
strong in spirit; he lived out in the
wilderness until the day when he
appeared publicly before Israel.Luke 2.1–9
10
1 IN those days a decree was issued
2 by the emperor Augustus for a
census to be taken throughout the
Roman world.
2 This was the first registration of its
kind; it took place when Quirinius was
governor of Syria.
3 Everyone made his way to his own
town to be registered.
4 Joseph went up to Judaea from the
town of Nazareth in Galilee, to register
in the city of David called Bethlehem,
because he was of the house of David
by descent; and with him went Mary, his
betrothed, who was expecting her child.
5 (2:4)
6 While they were there the time came
for her to have her baby,
7 and she gave birth to a son, her
firstborn. She wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger,
because there was no room for them at
the inn.
8 Now in this same district there were
shepherds out in the fields, keeping
watch through the night over their flock.
9 Suddenly an angel of the Lord
appeared to them, and the glory ofLuke 2.10–17
11
the Lord shone round them. They were
terrified,
10 but the angel said, Do not be afraid;
I bring you good news, news of great joy
for the whole nation.
11 Today there has been born to you
in the city of David a deliverer -- the
Messiah, the Lord.
12 This will be the sign for you: you
will find a baby wrapped in swaddling
clothes, and lying in a manger.
13 All at once there was with the angel
a great company of the heavenly host,
singing praise to God:
14 Glory to God in highest heaven,
and on earth peace to all in whom he
delights.
15 After the angels had left them and
returned to heaven the shepherds said
to one another, Come, let us go straight
to Bethlehem and see this thing that
has happened, which the Lord has made
known to us.
16 They hurried off and found Mary
and Joseph, and the baby lying in the
manger.
17 When they saw the child, they related
what they had been told about him;Luke 2.18–25
12
18 and all who heard were astonished at
what the shepherds said.
19 But Mary treasured up all these
things and pondered over them.
20 The shepherds returned glorifying
and praising God for what they had
heard and seen; it had all happened as
they had been told.
21 Eight days later the time came to
circumcise him, and he was given the
name Jesus, the name given by the
angel before he was conceived.
22 Then, after the purification had been
completed in accordance with the law of
Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem
to present him to the Lord
23 (as prescribed in the law of the Lord:
Every firstborn male shall be deemed to
belong to the Lord),
24 and also to make the offering as
stated in the law: a pair of turtle-doves
or two young pigeons.
25 There was at that time in Jerusalem
a man called Simeon. This man was
upright and devout, one who watched
and waited for the restoration of Israel,
and the Holy Spirit was upon him.Luke 2.26–34
13
26 It had been revealed to him by the
Holy Spirit that he would not see death
until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
27 Guided by the Spirit he came into the
temple; and when the parents brought
in the child Jesus to do for him what the
law required,
28 he took him in his arms, praised God,
and said:
29 Now, Lord, you are releasing your
servant in peace, according to your
promise.
30 For I have seen with my own eyes
the deliverance
31 you have made ready in full view of
all nations:
32 a light that will bring revelation to the
Gentiles and glory to your people Israel.
33 The child's father and mother were
full of wonder at what was being said
about him.
34 Simeon blessed them and said to
Mary his mother, This child is destined to
be a sign that will be rejected; and you
too will be pierced to the heart. Many in
Israel will stand or fall because of him;
and so the secret thoughts of many will
be laid bare.Luke 2.35–43
14
35 (2:34)
36 There was also a prophetess, Anna
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
Asher. She was a very old woman, who
had lived seven years with her husband
after she was first married,
37 and then alone as a widow to the
age of eighty-four. She never left the
temple, but worshipped night and day
with fasting and prayer.
38 Coming up at that very moment,
she gave thanks to God; and she talked
about the child to all who were looking
for the liberation of Jerusalem.
39 When they had done everything
prescribed in the law of the Lord, they
returned to Galilee to their own town of
Nazareth.
40 The child grew big and strong and full
of wisdom; and God's favour was upon
him.
41 Now it was the practice of his parents
to go to Jerusalem every year for the
Passover festival;
42 and when he was twelve, they made
the pilgrimage as usual.
43 When the festive season was over
and they set off for home, the boy JesusLuke 2.44–51
15
stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents
did not know of this;
44 but supposing that he was with the
party they travelled for a whole day, and
only then did they begin looking for him
among their friends and relations.
45 When they could not find him they
returned to Jerusalem to look for him;
46 and after three days they found him
sitting in the temple surrounded by the
teachers, listening to them and putting
questions;
47 and all who heard him were amazed
at his intelligence and the answers he
gave.
48 His parents were astonished to
see him there, and his mother said to
him, My son, why have you treated us
like this? Your father and I have been
anxiously searching for you.
49 Why did you search for me? he said.
Did you not know that I was bound to be
in my Father's house?
50 But they did not understand what he
meant.
51 Then he went back with them to
Nazareth, and continued to be underLuke 2.52–3.7
16
their authority; his mother treasured up
all these things in her heart.
52 As Jesus grew he advanced in wisdom
and in favour with God and men.
1 IN the fifteenth year of the emperor
Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was
governor of Judaea, when Herod was
tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip
prince of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and
Lysanias prince of Abilene,
2 during the high-priesthood of Annas
and Caiaphas, the word of God came to
John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
3 And he went all over the Jordan
valley proclaiming a baptism in token of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
4 as it is written in the book of the
prophecies of Isaiah: A voice cries in
the wilderness, Prepare the way for the
Lord; clear a straight path for him.
5 Every ravine shall be filled in, and
every mountain and hill levelled; winding
paths shall be straightened, and rough
ways made smooth;
6 and all mankind shall see God's
deliverance.
7 Crowds of people came out to be
baptized by him, and he said to them:
3Luke 3.8–15
17
Vipers brood! Who warned you to escape
from the wrath that is to come?
8 Prove your repentance by the fruit
you bear; and do not begin saying to
yourselves, We have Abraham for our
father. I tell you that God can make
children for Abraham out of these stones.
9 Already the axe is laid to the roots
of the trees; and every tree that fails
to produce good fruit is cut down and
thrown on the fire.'
10 The people asked him, Then what are
we to do?
11 He replied, Whoever has two shirts
must share with him who has none, and
whoever has food must do the same.
12 Among those who came to be
baptized were tax-collectors, and they
said to him, Teacher, what are we to do?
13 He told them, Exact no more than the
assessment.
14 Some soldiers also asked him, And
what of us? To them he said, No bullying;
no blackmail; make do with your pay!
15 The people were all agog, wondering
about John, whether perhaps he was the
Messiah,Luke 3.16–22
18
16 but he spoke out and said to them
all: I baptize you with water; but there is
one coming who is mightier than I am. I
am not worthy to unfasten the straps of
his sandals. He will baptize you with the
Holy Spirit and with fire.
17 His winnowing-shovel is ready in his
hand, to clear his threshing-floor and
gather the wheat into his granary; but
the chaff he will burn on a fire that can
never be put out.
18 In this and many other ways he made
his appeal to the people and announced
the good news.
19 But Herod the tetrarch, when he was
rebuked by him over the affair of his
brother's wife Herodias and all his other
misdeeds,
20 crowned them all by shutting John up
in prison.
21 DURING a general baptism of the
people, when Jesus too had been
baptized and was praying, heaven
opened
22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him
in bodily form like a dove, and there
came a voice from heaven, You are my
beloved Son; in you I delight.Luke 3.23–35
19
23 When Jesus began his work he was
about thirty years old, the son, as people
thought, of Joseph son of Heli,
24 son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of
Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph,
25 son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son
of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai,
26 son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son
of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda,
27 son of Johanan, son of Rhesa, son of
Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,
28 son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of
Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er,
29 son of Joshua, son of Eliezer, son of
Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi,
30 son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of
Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim,
31 son of Melea, son of Menna, son of
Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,
32 son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of
Boaz, son of Salma, son of Nahshon,
33 son of Amminadab, son of Arni, son
of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah,
34 son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of
Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,
35 son of Serug, son of Reu, son of
Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah,Luke 3.36–4.6
20
36 son of Cainan, son of Arphaxad, son
of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,
37 son of Methuselah, son of Enoch,
son of Jared, son of Mahalaleel, son of
Cainan,
38 son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of
Adam, son of God.
1 FULL of the Holy Spirit, Jesus
returned from the Jordan, and
for forty days he wandered in the
wilderness, led by the Spirit and tempted
by the devil. During that time he ate
nothing, and at the end of it he was
famished.
2 (4:1)
3 The devil said to him, If you are the
Son of God, tell this stone to become
bread.
4 Jesus answered, Scripture says, Man
is not to live on bread alone.
5 Next the devil led him to a height and
showed him in a flash all the kingdoms
of the world.
6 All this dominion will I give to you, he
said, and the glory that goes with it; for
it has been put in my hands and I can
give it to anyone I choose.
4Luke 4.7–16
21
7 You have only to do homage to me
and it will all be yours.
8 Jesus answered him, Scripture says,
You shall do homage to the Lord your
God and worship him alone.
9 The devil took him to Jerusalem and
set him on the parapet of the temple. If
you are the Son of God, he said, throw
yourself down from here;
10 for scripture says, He will put his
angels in charge of you,
11 and again, They will support you in
their arms for fear you should strike your
foot against a stone.
12 Jesus answered him, It has been
said, You are not to put the Lord your
God to the test.
13 So, having come to the end of all
these temptations, the devil departed,
biding his time.
14 THEN Jesus, armed with the power
of the Spirit, returned to Galilee; and
reports about him spread through the
whole countryside.
15 He taught in their synagogues and
everyone sang his praises.
16 He came to Nazareth, where he
had been brought up, and went to theLuke 4.17–23
22
synagogue on the sabbath day as he
regularly did. He stood up to read the
lesson
17 and was handed the scroll of the
prophet Isaiah. He opened the scroll and
found the passage which says,
18 The spirit of the Lord is upon me
because he has anointed me; he has
sent me to announce good news to the
poor, to proclaim release for prisoners
and recovery of sight for the blind; to let
the broken victims go free,
19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's
favour.
20 He rolled up the scroll, gave it back
to the attendant, and sat down; and all
eyes in the synagogue were fixed on
him.
21 He began to address them: Today, he
said, in your hearing this text has come
true.
22 There was general approval; they
were astonished that words of such
grace should fall from his lips. Is not this
Joseph's son? they asked.
23 Then Jesus said, No doubt you will
quote to me the proverb, Physician, heal
yourself! and say, We have heard of allLuke 4.24–31
23
your doings at Capernaum; do the same
here in your own home town.
24 Truly I tell you, he went on: no
prophet is recognized in his own country.
25 There were indeed many widows in
Israel in Elijah's time, when for three and
a half years the skies never opened, and
famine lay hard over the whole country;
26 yet it was to none of these that Elijah
was sent, but to a widow at Sarepta in
the territory of Sidon.
27 Again, in the time of the prophet
Elisha there were many lepers in Israel,
and not one of them was healed, but
only Naaman, the Syrian.
28 These words roused the whole
congregation to fury;
29 they leapt up, drove him out of the
town, and took him to the brow of the
hill on which it was built, meaning to hurl
him over the edge.
30 But he walked straight through the
whole crowd, and went away.
31 Coming down to Capernaum, a town
in Galilee, he taught the people on the
sabbath,Luke 4.32–38
24
32 and they were amazed at his
teaching, for what he said had the note
of authority.
33 Now there was a man in the
synagogue possessed by a demon, an
unclean spirit. He shrieked at the top of
his voice,
34 What do you want with us, Jesus of
Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?
I know who you are -- the Holy One of
God.
35 Jesus rebuked him: Be silent, he said,
and come out of him. Then the demon,
after throwing the man down in front of
the people, left him without doing him
any injury.
36 Amazement fell on them all and they
said to one another: What is there in
this man's words? He gives orders to the
unclean spirits with authority and power,
and they go.
37 So the news spread, and he was the
talk of the whole district.
38 On leaving the synagogue he went to
Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law
was in the grip of a high fever; and they
asked him to help her.Luke 4.39–5.1
25
39 He stood over her and rebuked the
fever. It left her, and she got up at once
and attended to their needs.
40 At sunset all who had friends ill with
diseases of one kind or another brought
them to him; and he laid his hands on
them one by one and healed them.
41 Demons also came out of many of
them, shouting, You are the Son of God.
But he rebuked them and forbade them
to speak, because they knew he was the
Messiah.
42 When day broke he went out and
made his way to a remote spot. But the
crowds went in search of him, and when
they came to where he was they pressed
him not to leave them.
43 But he said, I must give the good
news of the kingdom of God to the other
towns also, for that is what I was sent to
do.
44 So he proclaimed the gospel in the
synagogues of Judaea.
1 One day as he stood by the lake of
Gennesaret, with people crowding in
on him to listen to the word of God,
5Luke 5.2–9
26
2 he noticed two boats lying at the
water's edge; the fishermen had come
ashore and were washing their nets.
3 He got into one of the boats, which
belonged to Simon, and asked him to
put out a little way from the shore; then
he went on teaching the crowds as he
sat in the boat.
4 When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, Put out into deep water
and let down your nets for a catch.
5 Simon answered, Master, we were
hard at work all night and caught
nothing; but if you say so, I will let down
the nets.
6 They did so and made such a huge
catch of fish that their nets began to
split.
7 So they signalled to their partners in
the other boat to come and help them.
They came, and loaded both boats to the
point of sinking.
8 When Simon saw what had happened
he fell at Jesus's knees and said, Go,
Lord, leave me, sinner that I am!
9 For he and all his companions were
amazed at the catch they had made;Luke 5.10–16
27
10 so too were his partners James and
John, Zebedee's sons. Do not be afraid,
said Jesus to Simon; from now on you
will be catching people.
11 As soon as they had brought the
boats to land, they left everything and
followed him.
12 He was once in a certain town where
there was a man covered with leprosy;
when he saw Jesus, he threw himself to
the ground and begged his help. Sir, he
said, if only you will, you can make me
clean.
13 Jesus stretched out his hand and
touched him, saying, I will; be clean.
The leprosy left him immediately.
14 Jesus then instructed him not to tell
anybody. But go, he said, show yourself
to the priest, and make the offering laid
down by Moses for your cleansing; that
will certify the cure.
15 But the talk about him spread
ever wider, so that great crowds kept
gathering to hear him and to be cured of
their ailments.
16 And from time to time he would
withdraw to remote places for prayer.Luke 5.17–23
28
17 One day as he was teaching,
Pharisees and teachers of the law were
sitting round him. People had come from
every village in Galilee and from Judaea
and Jerusalem, and the power of the
Lord was with him to heal the sick.
18 Some men appeared carrying a
paralysed man on a bed, and tried to
bring him in and set him down in front of
Jesus.
19 Finding no way to do so because of
the crowd, they went up onto the roof
and let him down through the tiling, bed
and all, into the middle of the company
in front of Jesus.
20 When Jesus saw their faith, he said
to the man, Your sins are forgiven you.
21 The scribes and Pharisees began
asking among themselves, Who is this
fellow with his blasphemous talk? Who
but God alone can forgive sins?
22 But Jesus knew what they were
thinking and answered them: Why do
you harbour these thoughts?
23 Is it easier to say, Your sins are
forgiven you, or to say, Stand up and
walk?Luke 5.24–30
29
24 But to convince you that the Son of
Man has the right on earth to forgive
sins -- he turned to the paralysed man
-- I say to you, stand up, take your bed,
and go home.
25 At once the man rose to his feet
before their eyes, took up the bed he had
been lying on, and went home praising
God.
26 They were all lost in amazement
and praised God; filled with awe they
said, The things we have seen today are
beyond belief!
27 Later, when he went out, he saw a
tax-collector, Levi by name, at his seat
in the custom-house, and said to him,
Follow me.
28 Leaving everything, he got up and
followed him.
29 Afterwards Levi held a big reception
in his house for Jesus; among the guests
was a large party of tax-collectors and
others.
30 The Pharisees, some of whom were
scribes, complained to his disciples:
Why, they said, do you eat and drink
with tax-collectors and sinners?Luke 5.31–38
30
31 Jesus answered them: It is not the
healthy that need a doctor, but the sick;
32 I have not come to call the virtuous
but sinners to repentance.
33 Then they said to him, John's
disciples are much given to fasting and
the practice of prayer, and so are the
disciples of the Pharisees; but yours eat
and drink.
34 Jesus replied, Can you make the
bridegroom's friends fast while the
bridegroom is with them?
35 But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from
them; that will be the time for them to
fast.
36 He told them this parable also: No
one tears a piece from a new garment
to patch an old one; if he does, he will
have made a hole in the new garment,
and the patch taken from the new will
not match the old.
37 No one puts new wine into old
wineskins; if he does, the new wine will
burst the skins, the wine will spill out,
and the skins be ruined.
38 New wine goes into fresh skins!Luke 5.39–6.8
31
39 And no one after drinking old wine
wants new; for he says, The old wine is
good.
1 One sabbath he was going through
the cornfields, and his disciples were
plucking the ears of corn, rubbing them
in their hands, and eating them.
2 Some Pharisees said, Why are you
doing what is forbidden on the sabbath?
3 Jesus answered, Have you not read
what David did when he and his men
were hungry?
4 He went into the house of God and
took the sacred bread to eat and gave it
to his men, though only the priests are
allowed to eat it.
5 He also said to them, The Son of Man
is master of the sabbath.
6 On another sabbath he had gone to
synagogue and was teaching. There was
a man in the congregation whose right
arm was withered;
7 and the scribes and Pharisees were on
the watch to see whether Jesus would
heal him on the sabbath, so that they
could find a charge to bring against him.
8 But he knew what was in their minds
and said to the man with the withered
6Luke 6.9–16
32
arm, Stand up and come out here. So he
stood up and came out.
9 Then Jesus said to them, I put this
question to you: is it permitted to do
good or to do evil on the sabbath, to
save life or to destroy it?
10 He looked round at them all, and
then he said to the man, Stretch out
your arm. He did so, and his arm was
restored.
11 But they totally failed to understand,
and began to discuss with one another
what they could do to Jesus.
12 During this time he went out one day
into the hill-country to pray, and spent
the night in prayer to God.
13 When day broke he called his disciples
to him, and from among them he chose
twelve and named them apostles:
14 Simon, to whom he gave the name
Peter, and Andrew his brother, James
and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
15 Matthew and Thomas, James son of
Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the
Zealot,
16 Judas son of James, and Judas
Iscariot who turned traitor.Luke 6.17–23
33
17 He came down the hill with them and
stopped on some level ground where a
large crowd of his disciples had gathered,
and with them great numbers of people
from Jerusalem and all Judaea and from
the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,
who had come to listen to him, and to be
cured of their diseases.
18 Those who were troubled with
unclean spirits were healed;
19 and everyone in the crowd was trying
to touch him, because power went out
from him and cured them all.
20 TURNING to his disciples he began to
speak: Blessed are you who are in need;
the kingdom of God is yours.
21 Blessed are you who now go hungry;
you will be satisfied. Blessed are you
who weep now; you will laugh.
22 Blessed are you when people hate
you and ostracize you, when they
insult you and slander your very name,
because of the Son of Man.
23 On that day exult and dance for joy,
for you have a rich reward in heaven;
that is how their fathers treated the
prophets.Luke 6.24–33
34
24 But alas for you who are rich; you
have had your time of happiness.
25 Alas for you who are well fed now;
you will go hungry. Alas for you who
laugh now; you will mourn and weep.
26 Alas for you when all speak well of
you; that is how their fathers treated the
false prophets.
27 But to you who are listening I say:
Love your enemies; do good to those
who hate you;
28 bless those who curse you; pray for
those who treat you spitefully.
29 If anyone hits you on the cheek, offer
the other also; if anyone takes your coat,
let him have your shirt as well.
30 Give to everyone who asks you;
if anyone takes what is yours, do not
demand it back.
31 Treat others as you would like them
to treat you.
32 If you love only those who love you,
what credit is that to you? Even sinners
love those who love them.
33 Again, if you do good only to those
who do good to you, what credit is there
in that? Even sinners do as much.Luke 6.34–40
35
34 And if you lend only where you expect
to be repaid, what credit is there in that?
Even sinners lend to each other to be
repaid in full.
35 But you must love your enemies and
do good, and lend without expecting
any return; and you will have a rich
reward: you will be sons of the Most
High, because he himself is kind to the
ungrateful and the wicked.
36 Be compassionate, as your Father is
compassionate.
37 Do not judge, and you will not be
judged; do not condemn, and you will
not be condemned; pardon, and you will
be pardoned;
38 give, and gifts will be given you. Good
measure, pressed and shaken down and
running over, will be poured into your
lap; for whatever measure you deal out
to others will be dealt to you in turn.
39 He also spoke to them in a parable:
Can one blind man guide another? Will
not both fall into the ditch?
40 No pupil ranks above his teacher;
fully trained he can but reach his
teacher's level.Luke 6.41–47
36
41 Why do you look at the speck in your
brother's eye, with never a thought for
the plank in your own?
42 How can you say to your brother,
Brother, let me take the speck out of
your eye, when you are blind to the
plank in your own? You hypocrite! First
take the plank out of your own eye,
and then you will see clearly to take the
speck out of your brother's.
43 There is no such thing as a good tree
producing bad fruit, nor yet a bad tree
producing good fruit.
44 Each tree is known by its own fruit:
you do not gather figs from brambles or
pick grapes from thistles.
45 Good people produce good from the
store of good within themselves; and evil
people produce evil from the evil within
them. For the words that the mouth
utters come from the overflowing of the
heart.
46 Why do you call me Lord, Lord -- and
never do what I tell you?
47 Everyone who comes to me and
hears my words and acts on them -- I
will show you what he is like.Luke 6.48–7.6
37
48 He is like a man building a house,
who dug deep and laid the foundations
on rock. When the river was in flood,
it burst upon that house, but could not
shift it, because it had been soundly
built.
49 But he who hears and does not act
is like a man who built his house on the
soil without foundations. As soon as the
river burst upon it, the house collapsed,
and fell with a great crash.
1 WHEN he had finished addressing
the people, he entered Capernaum.
2 A centurion there had a servant whom
he valued highly, but the servant was ill
and near to death.
3 Hearing about Jesus, he sent some
Jewish elders to ask him to come and
save his servant's life.
4 They approached Jesus and made an
urgent appeal to him: He deserves this
favour from you, they said,
5 for he is a friend of our nation and it is
he who built us our synagogue.
6 Jesus went with them; but when he
was not far from the house, the centurion
sent friends with this message: Do not
7Luke 7.7–13
38
trouble further, sir; I am not worthy to
have you come under my roof,
7 and that is why I did not presume
to approach you in person. But say the
word and my servant will be cured.
8 I know, for I am myself under orders,
with soldiers under me. I say to one, Go,
and he goes; to another, Come here, and
he comes; and to my servant, Do this,
and he does it.
9 When Jesus heard this, he was
astonished, and, turning to the crowd
that was following him, he said, I tell
you, not even in Israel have I found such
faith.
10 When the messengers returned to
the house, they found the servant in
good health.
11 Afterwards Jesus went to a town
called Nain, accompanied by his disciples
and a large crowd.
12 As he approached the gate of the
town he met a funeral. The dead man
was the only son of his widowed mother;
and many of the townspeople were there
with her.
13 When the Lord saw her his heart went
out to her, and he said, Do not weep.Luke 7.14–21
39
14 He stepped forward and laid his hand
on the bier; and the bearers halted.
Then he spoke: Young man, I tell you to
get up.
15 The dead man sat up and began to
speak; and Jesus restored him to his
mother.
16 Everyone was filled with awe and
praised God. A great prophet has arisen
among us, they said; God has shown his
care for his people.
17 The story of what he had done spread
through the whole of Judaea and all the
region around.
18 When John was informed of all this
by his disciples,
19 he summoned two of them and sent
them to the Lord with this question: Are
you the one who is to come, or are we
to expect someone else?
20 The men made their way to Jesus and
said, John the Baptist has sent us to ask
you, Are you the one who is to come, or
are we to expect someone else?
21 There and then he healed many
sufferers from diseases, plagues, and
evil spirits; and on many blind people he
bestowed sight.Luke 7.22–28
40
22 Then he gave them this answer: Go
and tell John what you have seen and
heard: the blind regain their sight, the
lame walk, lepers are made clean, the
deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the
poor are brought good news --
23 and happy is he who does not find
me an obstacle to faith.
24 After John's messengers had left,
Jesus began to speak about him to the
crowds: What did you go out into the
wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
wind?
25 No? Then what did you go out to see?
A man dressed in finery? Grand clothes
and luxury are to be found in palaces.
26 But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes indeed, and far more than
a prophet.
27 He is the man of whom scripture
says, Here is my herald, whom I send
ahead of you, and he will prepare your
way before you.
28 I tell you, among all who have been
born, no one has been greater than
John; yet the least in the kingdom of
God is greater than he is.Luke 7.29–37
41
29 When they heard him, all the
people, including the tax-collectors,
acknowledged the goodness of God, for
they had accepted John's baptism;
30 but the Pharisees and lawyers, who
had refused his baptism, rejected God's
purpose for themselves.
31 How can I describe the people of this
generation? What are they like?
32 They are like children sitting in the
market-place and calling to each other,
We piped for you and you would not
dance. We lamented, and you would not
mourn.
33 For John the Baptist came, neither
eating bread nor drinking wine, and you
say, He is possessed.
34 The Son of Man came, eating and
drinking, and you say, Look at him!
A glutton and a drinker, a friend of
tax-collectors and sinners!
35 And yet God's wisdom is proved right
by all who are her children.
36 One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to
a meal; he went to the Pharisee's house
and took his place at table.
37 A woman who was living an immoral
life in the town had learned that JesusLuke 7.38–44
42
was a guest in the Pharisee's house and
had brought oil of myrrh in a small flask.
38 She took her place behind him, by
his feet, weeping. His feet were wet with
her tears and she wiped them with her
hair, kissing them and anointing them
with the myrrh.
39 When his host the Pharisee saw this
he said to himself, If this man were a
real prophet, he would know who this
woman is who is touching him, and what
a bad character she is.
40 Jesus took him up: Simon, he said, I
have something to say to you. What is it,
Teacher? he asked.
41 Two men were in debt to a
moneylender: one owed him five
hundred silver pieces, the other fifty.
42 As they did not have the means to
pay he cancelled both debts. Now, which
will love him more?
43 Simon replied, I should think the one
that was let off more. You are right, said
Jesus.
44 Then turning to the woman, he said
to Simon, You see this woman? I came
to your house: you provided no water for
my feet; but this woman has made myLuke 7.45–8.2
43
feet wet with her tears and wiped them
with her hair.
45 You gave me no kiss; but she has
been kissing my feet ever since I came
in.
46 You did not anoint my head with
oil; but she has anointed my feet with
myrrh.
47 So, I tell you, her great love proves
that her many sins have been forgiven;
where little has been forgiven, little love
is shown.
48 Then he said to her, Your sins are
forgiven.
49 The other guests began to ask
themselves, Who is this, that he can
forgive sins?
50 But he said to the woman, Your faith
has saved you; go in peace.
1 AFTER this he went journeying
from town to town and village to
village, proclaiming the good news of
the kingdom of God. With him were the
Twelve
2 and a number of women who had been
set free from evil spirits and infirmities:
Mary, known as Mary of Magdala, from
whom seven demons had come out,
8Luke 8.3–10
44
3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza a steward
of Herod's, Susanna, and many others.
These women provided for them out of
their own resources.
4 People were now gathering in large
numbers, and as they made their way to
him from one town after another, he said
in a parable:
5 A sower went out to sow his seed. And
as he sowed, some of the seed fell along
the footpath, where it was trampled on,
and the birds ate it up.
6 Some fell on rock and, after coming
up, it withered for lack of moisture.
7 Some fell among thistles, and the
thistles grew up with it and choked it.
8 And some of the seed fell into
good soil, and grew, and yielded a
hundredfold. As he said this he called
out, If you have ears to hear, then hear.
9 His disciples asked him what this
parable meant,
10 and he replied, It has been granted
to you to know the secrets of the
kingdom of God; but the others have
only parables, so that they may look
but see nothing, hear but understand
nothing.Luke 8.11–17
45
11 This is what the parable means. The
seed is the word of God.
12 The seed along the footpath stands
for those who hear it, and then the devil
comes and carries off the word from
their hearts for fear they should believe
and be saved.
13 The seed sown on rock stands for
those who receive the word with joy
when they hear it, but have no root;
they are believers for a while, but in the
time of testing they give up.
14 That which fell among thistles
represents those who hear, but their
growth is choked by cares and wealth
and the pleasures of life, and they bring
nothing to maturity.
15 But the seed in good soil represents
those who bring a good and honest
heart to the hearing of the word, hold it
fast, and by their perseverance yield a
harvest.
16 Nobody lights a lamp and then covers
it with a basin or puts it under the bed.
You put it on a lampstand so that those
who come in may see the light.
17 For there is nothing hidden that will
not be disclosed, nothing concealed thatLuke 8.18–24
46
will not be made known and brought into
the open.
18 Take care, then, how you listen; for
those who have will be given more, and
those who have not will forfeit even what
they think they have.
19 His mother and his brothers arrived
but could not get to him for the crowd.
20 He was told, Your mother and
brothers are standing outside, and want
to see you.
21 He replied, My mother and my
brothers are those who hear the word of
God and act upon it.
22 One day he got into a boat with his
disciples and said to them, Let us cross
over to the other side of the lake. So
they put out;
23 and as they sailed along he fell
asleep. Then a heavy squall struck the
lake; they began to ship water and were
in grave danger.
24 They came and roused him: Master,
Master, we are sinking! they cried. He
awoke, and rebuked the wind and the
turbulent waters. The storm subsided
and there was calm.Luke 8.25–30
47
25 Where is your faith? he asked. In
fear and astonishment they said to one
another, Who can this be? He gives his
orders to the wind and the waves, and
they obey him.
26 So they landed in the country of the
Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
27 As he stepped ashore he was met by
a man from the town who was possessed
by demons. For a long time he had
neither worn clothes nor lived in a house,
but stayed among the tombs.
28 When he saw Jesus he cried out, and
fell at his feet. What do you want with
me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? he
shouted. I implore you, do not torment
me.
29 For Jesus was already ordering the
unclean spirit to come out of the man.
Many a time it had seized him, and then,
for safety's sake, they would secure him
with chains and fetters; but each time
he broke loose and was driven by the
demon out into the wilds.
30 Jesus asked him, What is your name?
Legion, he replied. This was because so
many demons had taken possession of
him.Luke 8.31–37
48
31 And they begged him not to banish
them to the abyss.
32 There was a large herd of pigs
nearby, feeding on the hillside; and the
demons begged him to let them go into
these pigs. He gave them leave;
33 the demons came out of the man and
went into the pigs, and the herd rushed
over the edge into the lake and were
drowned.
34 When the men in charge of them saw
what had happened, they took to their
heels and carried the news to the town
and countryside;
35 and the people came out to see what
had happened. When they came to
Jesus, and found the man from whom
the demons had gone out sitting at his
feet clothed and in his right mind, they
were afraid.
36 Eyewitnesses told them how the
madman had been cured.
37 Then the whole population of the
Gerasene district was overcome by fear
and asked Jesus to go away. So he got
into the boat and went away.Luke 8.38–45
49
38 The man from whom the demons had
gone out begged to go with him; but
Jesus sent him away:
39 Go back home, he said, and tell them
what God has done for you. The man
went all over the town proclaiming what
Jesus had done for him.
40 When Jesus returned, the people
welcomed him, for they were all
expecting him.
41 Then a man appeared -- Jairus was
his name and he was president of the
synagogue. Throwing himself down at
Jesus's feet he begged him to come to
his house,
42 because his only daughter, who was
about twelve years old, was dying. While
Jesus was on his way he could hardly
breathe for the crowds.
43 Among them was a woman who had
suffered from haemorrhages for twelve
years; and nobody had been able to cure
her.
44 She came up from behind and
touched the edge of his cloak, and at
once her haemorrhage stopped.
45 Jesus said, Who was it who touched
me? All disclaimed it, and Peter said,Luke 8.46–53
50
Master, the crowds are hemming you in
and pressing upon you!
46 But Jesus said, Someone did touch
me, for I felt that power had gone out
from me.
47 Then the woman, seeing that she was
detected, came trembling and fell at his
feet. Before all the people she explained
why she had touched him and how she
had been cured instantly.
48 He said to her, Daughter, your faith
has healed you. Go in peace.
49 While he was still speaking, a man
came from the president's house with
the message, Your daughter is dead; do
not trouble the teacher any more.
50 But Jesus heard, and said, Do not be
afraid; simply have faith and she will be
well again.
51 When he arrived at the house he
allowed no one to go in with him except
Peter, John, and James, and the child's
father and mother.
52 Everyone was weeping and lamenting
for her. He said, Stop your weeping; she
is not dead: she is asleep;
53 and they laughed at him, well
knowing that she was dead.Luke 8.54–9.6
51
54 But Jesus took hold of her hand and
called to her: Get up, my child.
55 Her spirit returned, she stood up
immediately, and he told them to give
her something to eat.
56 Her parents were astounded; but he
forbade them to tell anyone what had
happened.
1 CALLING the Twelve together he
gave them power and authority
to overcome all demons and to cure
diseases,
2 and sent them out to proclaim the
kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
3 Take nothing for the journey, he told
them, neither stick nor pack, neither
bread nor money; nor are you to have a
second coat.
4 When you enter a house, stay there
until you leave that place.
5 As for those who will not receive you,
when you leave their town shake the
dust off your feet as a warning to them.
6 So they set out and travelled from
village to village, and everywhere they
announced the good news and healed
the sick.
9Luke 9.7–13
52
7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all
that was happening, and did not know
what to make of it; for some were saying
that John had been raised from the dead,
8 others that Elijah had appeared,
others again that one of the prophets of
old had come back to life.
9 Herod said, As for John, I beheaded
him; but who is this I hear so much
about? And he was anxious to see him.
10 On their return the apostles gave
Jesus an account of all they had done.
Then he took them with him and
withdrew privately to a town called
Bethsaida,
11 but the crowds found out and
followed. He welcomed them, and spoke
to them about the kingdom of God, and
cured those who were in need of healing.
12 When evening was drawing on, the
Twelve came to him and said, Send the
people off, so that they can go into the
villages and farms round about to find
food and lodging, for this is a remote
place we are in.
13 Give them something to eat
yourselves, he replied. But they said,
All we have is five loaves and two fish,Luke 9.14–22
53
nothing more -- or do you intend us to
go and buy food for all these people?
14 For there were about five thousand
men. Then he said to his disciples, Make
them sit down in groups of about fifty.
15 They did so and got them all seated.
16 Then, taking the five loaves and the
two fish, he looked up to heaven, said
the blessing over them, broke them, and
gave them to the disciples to distribute
to the people.
17 They all ate and were satisfied; and
the scraps they left were picked up and
filled twelve baskets.
18 One day, when he had been praying
by himself in the company of his
disciples, he asked them, Who do the
people say I am?
19 They answered, Some say John the
Baptist, others Elijah, others that one of
the prophets of old has come back to
life.
20 And you, he said, who do you say I
am? Peter answered, God's Messiah.
21 Then he gave them strict orders not
to tell this to anyone.
22 And he said, The Son of Man has
to endure great sufferings, and to beLuke 9.23–29
54
rejected by the elders, chief priests, and
scribes, to be put to death, and to be
raised again on the third day.
23 To everybody he said, Anyone who
wants to be a follower of mine must
renounce self; day after day he must
take up his cross, and follow me.
24 Whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for my
sake will save it.
25 What does anyone gain by winning
the whole world at the cost of destroying
himself?
26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my
words, the Son of Man will be ashamed
of him, when he comes in his glory and
the glory of the Father and the holy
angels.
27 In truth I tell you: there are some
of those standing here who will not
taste death before they have seen the
kingdom of God.
28 About a week after this he took
Peter, John, and James and went up a
mountain to pray.
29 And while he was praying the
appearance of his face changed and his
clothes became dazzling white.Luke 9.30–37
55
30 Suddenly there were two men talking
with him -- Moses and Elijah --
31 who appeared in glory and spoke of
his departure, the destiny he was to fulfil
in Jerusalem.
32 Peter and his companions had been
overcome by sleep; but when they
awoke, they saw his glory and the two
men who stood beside him.
33 As these two were moving away
from Jesus, Peter said to him, Master,
it is good that we are here. Shall we
make three shelters, one for you, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah? but he spoke
without knowing what he was saying.
34 As he spoke there came a cloud
which cast its shadow over them; they
were afraid as they entered the cloud,
35 and from it a voice spoke: This is my
Son, my Chosen; listen to him.
36 After the voice had spoken, Jesus
was seen to be alone. The disciples kept
silence and did not at that time say a
word to anyone of what they had seen.
37 Next day when they came down from
the mountain a large crowd came to
meet him.Luke 9.38–45
56
38 A man in the crowd called out:
Teacher, I implore you to look at my son,
my only child.
39 From time to time a spirit seizes him
and with a sudden scream throws him
into convulsions so that he foams at the
mouth; it keeps on tormenting him and
can hardly be made to let him go.
40 I begged your disciples to drive it
out, but they could not.
41 Jesus answered, What an unbelieving
and perverse generation! How long shall
I be with you and endure you? Bring
your son here.
42 But before the boy could reach him
the demon dashed him to the ground
and threw him into convulsions. Jesus
spoke sternly to the unclean spirit, cured
the boy, and gave him back to his father.
43 And they were all struck with awe at
the greatness of God. Amid the general
astonishment at all he was doing, Jesus
said to his disciples,
44 Listen to what I have to tell you. The
Son of Man is to be given up into the
power of men.
45 But they did not understand what he
said; its meaning had been hidden fromLuke 9.46–53
57
them, so that they could not grasp it,
and they were afraid to ask him about it.
46 An argument started among them as
to which of them was the greatest.
47 Jesus, who knew what was going on
in their minds, took a child, stood him by
his side,
48 and said, Whoever receives this child
in my name receives me; and whoever
receives me receives the one who sent
me. For the least among you all is the
greatest.
49 Master, said John, we saw someone
driving out demons in your name, but as
he is not one of us we tried to stop him.
50 Jesus said to him, Do not stop him,
for he who is not against you is on your
side.
51 AS THE time approached when he
was to be taken up to heaven, he set his
face resolutely towards Jerusalem,
52 and sent messengers ahead. They
set out and went into a Samaritan village
to make arrangements for him;
53 but the villagers would not receive
him because he was on his way to
Jerusalem.Luke 9.54–10.1
58
54 When the disciples James and John
saw this they said, Lord, do you want us
to call down fire from heaven to consume
them?
55 But he turned and rebuked them,
56 and they went on to another village.
57 As they were going along the road
a man said to him, I will follow you
wherever you go.
58 Jesus answered, Foxes have their
holes and birds their roosts; but the Son
of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
59 To another he said, Follow me, but
the man replied, Let me first go and bury
my father.
60 Jesus said, Leave the dead to bury
their dead; you must go and announce
the kingdom of God.
61 Yet another said, I will follow you,
sir; but let me first say goodbye to my
people at home.
62 To him Jesus said, No one who sets
his hand to the plough and then looks
back is fit for the kingdom of God.
1 After this the Lord appointed
a further seventy-two and sent
them on ahead in pairs to every town
and place he himself intended to visit.
10Luke 10.2–11
59
2 He said to them: The crop is heavy,
but the labourers are few. Ask the owner
therefore to send labourers to bring in
the harvest.
3 Be on your way; I am sending you like
lambs among wolves.
4 Carry no purse or pack, and travel
barefoot. Exchange no greetings on the
road.
5 When you go into a house, let your
first words be, Peace to this house.
6 If there is a man of peace there, your
peace will rest on him; if not, it will
return to you.
7 Stay in that house, sharing their food
and drink; for the worker deserves his
pay. Do not move around from house to
house.
8 When you enter a town and you are
made welcome, eat the food provided
for you;
9 heal the sick there, and say, The
kingdom of God has come upon you.
10 But when you enter a town and you
are not made welcome, go out into its
streets and say,
11 The very dust of your town that clings
to our feet we wipe off to your shame.Luke 10.12–19
60
Only take note of this: the kingdom of
God has come.
12 I tell you, on the day of judgement
the fate of Sodom will be more bearable
than the fate of that town.
13 Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you,
Bethsaida! If the miracles performed in
you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon,
they would have repented long ago,
sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre
and Sidon at the judgement than for
you.
15 As for you, Capernaum, will you
be exalted to heaven? No, you will be
brought down to Hades!
16 Whoever listens to you listens to me;
whoever rejects you rejects me. And
whoever rejects me rejects the One who
sent me.
17 The seventy-two came back jubilant.
In your name, Lord, they said, even the
demons submit to us.
18 He replied, I saw Satan fall, like
lightning, from heaven.
19 And I have given you the power to
tread underfoot snakes and scorpionsLuke 10.20–26
61
and all the forces of the enemy. Nothing
will ever harm you.
20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice that
the spirits submit to you, but that your
names are enrolled in heaven.
21 At that moment Jesus exulted in the
Holy Spirit and said, I thank you, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding
these things from the learned and wise,
and revealing them to the simple. Yes,
Father, such was your choice.
22 Everything is entrusted to me by my
Father; no one knows who the Son is
but the Father, or who the Father is but
the Son, and those to whom the Son
chooses to reveal him.
23 When he was alone with his disciples
he turned to them and said, Happy the
eyes that see what you are seeing!
24 I tell you, many prophets and kings
wished to see what you now see, yet
never saw it; to hear what you hear, yet
never heard it.
25 A LAWYER once came forward to test
him by asking: Teacher, what must I do
to inherit eternal life?
26 Jesus said, What is written in the
law? What is your reading of it?Luke 10.27–34
62
27 He replied, Love the Lord your God
with all your heart, and with all your
soul, with all your strength, and with
all your mind; and your neighbour as
yourself.
28 That is the right answer, said Jesus;
do that and you will have life.
29 Wanting to justify his question, he
asked, But who is my neighbour?
30 Jesus replied, A man was on his way
from Jerusalem down to Jericho when he
was set upon by robbers, who stripped
and beat him, and went off leaving him
half dead.
31 It so happened that a priest was
going down by the same road, and when
he saw him, he went past on the other
side.
32 So too a Levite came to the place,
and when he saw him went past on the
other side.
33 But a Samaritan who was going that
way came upon him, and when he saw
him he was moved to pity.
34 He went up and bandaged his
wounds, bathing them with oil and wine.
Then he lifted him on to his own beast,Luke 10.35–41
63
brought him to an inn, and looked after
him.
35 Next day he produced two silver
pieces and gave them to the innkeeper,
and said, Look after him; and if you
spend more, I will repay you on my way
back.
36 Which of these three do you think
was neighbour to the man who fell into
the hands of the robbers?
37 He answered, The one who showed
him kindness. Jesus said to him, Go and
do as he did.
38 While they were on their way Jesus
came to a village where a woman named
Martha made him welcome.
39 She had a sister, Mary, who seated
herself at the Lord's feet and stayed
there listening to his words.
40 Now Martha was distracted by her
many tasks, so she came to him and
said, Lord, do you not care that my sister
has left me to get on with the work by
myself? Tell her to come and give me a
hand.
41 But the Lord answered, Martha,
Martha, you are fretting and fussing
about so many things;Luke 10.42–11.8
64
42 only one thing is necessary. Mary has
chosen what is best; it shall not be taken
away from her.
1 At one place after Jesus had
been praying, one of his disciples
said, Lord, teach us to pray, as John
taught his disciples.
2 He answered, When you pray, say,
Father, may your name be hallowed;
your kingdom come.
3 Give us each day our daily bread.
4 And forgive us our sins, for we too
forgive all who have done us wrong. And
do not put us to the test.
5 Then he said to them, Suppose one
of you has a friend who comes to him
in the middle of the night and says, My
friend, lend me three loaves,
6 for a friend of mine on a journey
has turned up at my house, and I have
nothing to offer him;
7 and he replies from inside, Do not
bother me. The door is shut for the
night; my children and I have gone to
bed; and I cannot get up and give you
what you want.
8 I tell you that even if he will not get
up and provide for him out of friendship,
11Luke 11.9–17
65
his very persistence will make the man
get up and give him all he needs.
9 So I say to you, ask, and you will
receive; seek, and you will find; knock,
and the door will be opened to you.
10 For everyone who asks receives,
those who seek find, and to those who
knock, the door will be opened.
11 Would any father among you offer his
son a snake when he asks for a fish,
12 or a scorpion when he asks for an
egg?
13 If you, bad as you are, know how to
give good things to your children, how
much more will the heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!
14 HE was driving out a demon which
was dumb; and when the demon had
come out, the dumb man began to
speak. The people were astonished,
15 but some of them said, It is by
Beelzebul prince of demons that he
drives the demons out.
16 Others, by way of a test, demanded
of him a sign from heaven.
17 But he knew what was in their
minds, and said, Every kingdom dividedLuke 11.18–24
66
against itself is laid waste, and a divided
household falls.
18 And if Satan is divided against
himself, how can his kingdom stand
-- since, as you claim, I drive out the
demons by Beelzebul?
19 If it is by Beelzebul that I drive out
demons, by whom do your own people
drive them out? If this is your argument,
they themselves will refute you.
20 But if it is by the finger of God that I
drive out the demons, then be sure the
kingdom of God has already come upon
you.
21 When a strong man fully armed is on
guard over his palace, his possessions
are safe.
22 But when someone stronger attacks
and overpowers him, he carries off the
arms and armour on which the man had
relied and distributes the spoil.
23 He who is not with me is against me,
and he who does not gather with me
scatters.
24 When an unclean spirit comes out
of someone it wanders over the desert
sands seeking a resting-place; and if itLuke 11.25–31
67
finds none, it says, I will go back to the
home I left.
25 So it returns and finds the house
swept clean and tidy.
26 It goes off and collects seven other
spirits more wicked than itself, and they
all come in and settle there; and in the
end that person's plight is worse than
before.
27 While he was speaking thus, a woman
in the crowd called out, Happy the womb
that carried you and the breasts that
suckled you!
28 He rejoined, No, happy are those who
hear the word of God and keep it.
29 With the crowds swarming round
him he went on to say: This is a wicked
generation. It demands a sign, and the
only sign that will be given it is the sign
of Jonah.
30 For just as Jonah was a sign to the
Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to
this generation.
31 The queen of the south will
appear in court when the men of this
generation are on trial, and ensure their
condemnation; for she came from the
ends of the earth to listen to the wisdomLuke 11.32–39
68
of Solomon, and what is here is greater
than Solomon.
32 The men of Nineveh will appear in
court when this generation is on trial,
and ensure its condemnation; for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah; and
what is here is greater than Jonah.
33 No one lights a lamp and puts it in
a cellar, but on the lampstand so that
those who come in may see the light.
34 The lamp of your body is the eye.
When your eyes are sound, you have
light for your whole body; but when they
are bad, your body is in darkness.
35 See to it then that the light you have
is not darkness.
36 If you have light for your whole body
with no trace of darkness, it will all be
full of light, as when the light of a lamp
shines on you.
37 WHEN he had finished speaking, a
Pharisee invited him to a meal, and he
came in and sat down.
38 The Pharisee noticed with surprise
that he had not begun by washing before
the meal.
39 But the Lord said to him, You
Pharisees clean the outside of cup andLuke 11.40–48
69
plate; but inside you are full of greed
and wickedness.
40 You fools! Did not he who made the
outside make the inside too?
41 But let what is inside be given in
charity, and all is clean.
42 Alas for you Pharisees! You pay tithes
of mint and rue and every garden herb,
but neglect justice and the love of God.
It is these you should have practised,
without overlooking the others.
43 Alas for you Pharisees! You love to
have the chief seats in synagogues, and
to be greeted respectfully in the street.
44 Alas, alas, you are like unmarked
graves which people walk over unawares.
45 At this one of the lawyers said,
Teacher, when you say things like this
you are insulting us too.
46 Jesus rejoined: Alas for you lawyers
also! You load men with intolerable
burdens, and will not lift a finger to
lighten the load.
47 Alas, you build monuments to the
prophets whom your fathers murdered,
48 and so testify that you approve
of the deeds your fathers did; theyLuke 11.49–12.1
70
committed the murders and you provide
the monuments.
49 This is why the Wisdom of God
said, I will send them prophets and
messengers; and some of these they will
persecute and kill;
50 so that this generation will have to
answer for the blood of all the prophets
shed since the foundation of the world;
51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah who met his death between
the altar and the sanctuary. I tell you,
this generation will have to answer for it
all.
52 Alas for you lawyers! You have taken
away the key of knowledge. You did not
go in yourselves, and those who were
trying to go in, you prevented.
53 After he had left the house, the
scribes and Pharisees began to assail
him fiercely and to ply him with a host of
questions,
54 laying snares to catch him with his
own words.
1 MEANWHILE, when a crowd of
many thousands had gathered,
packed so close that they were trampling
on one another, he began to speak first
12Luke 12.2–8
71
to his disciples: Be on your guard against
the leaven of the Pharisees -- I mean
their hypocrisy.
2 There is nothing covered up that will
not be uncovered, nothing hidden that
will not be made known.
3 Therefore everything you have said in
the dark will be heard in broad daylight,
and what you have whispered behind
closed doors will be shouted from the
housetops.
4 To you who are my friends I say: do
not fear those who kill the body and after
that have nothing more they can do.
5 I will show you whom to fear: fear him
who, after he has killed, has authority to
cast into hell. Believe me, he is the one
to fear.
6 Are not five sparrows sold for
twopence? Yet not one of them is
overlooked by God.
7 More than that, even the hairs of your
head have all been counted. Do not be
afraid; you are worth more than any
number of sparrows.
8 I tell you this: whoever acknowledges
me before others, the Son of Man will
acknowledge before the angels of God;Luke 12.9–16
72
9 but whoever disowns me before others
will be disowned before the angels of
God.
10 Anyone who speaks a word against
the Son of Man will be forgiven; but for
him who slanders the Holy Spirit there
will be no forgiveness.
11 When you are brought before
synagogues and state authorities, do not
worry about how you will conduct your
defence or what you will say.
12 When the time comes the Holy Spirit
will instruct you what to say.
13 Someone in the crowd said to him,
Teacher, tell my brother to divide the
family property with me.
14 He said to the man, Who set me over
you to judge or arbitrate?
15 Then to the people he said, Beware!
Be on your guard against greed of every
kind, for even when someone has more
than enough, his possessions do not give
him life.
16 And he told them this parable: There
was a rich man whose land yielded a
good harvest.Luke 12.17–24
73
17 He debated with himself: What am I
to do? I have not the space to store my
produce.
18 This is what I will do, said he: I will
pull down my barns and build them
bigger. I will collect in them all my grain
and other goods,
19 and I will say to myself, You have
plenty of good things laid by, enough for
many years to come: take life easy, eat,
drink, and enjoy yourself.
20 But God said to him, You fool, this
very night you must surrender your life;
and the money you have made, who will
get it now?
21 That is how it is with the man who
piles up treasure for himself and remains
a pauper in the sight of God.'
22 To his disciples he said, This is why I
tell you not to worry about food to keep
you alive or clothes to cover your body.
23 Life is more than food, the body more
than clothes.
24 Think of the ravens: they neither sow
nor reap; they have no storehouse or
barn; yet God feeds them. You are worth
far more than the birds!Luke 12.25–33
74
25 Can anxious thought add a day to
your life?
26 If, then, you cannot do even a very
little thing, why worry about the rest?
27 Think of the lilies: they neither spin
nor weave; yet I tell you, even Solomon
in all his splendour was not attired like
one of them.
28 If that is how God clothes the grass,
which is growing in the field today, and
tomorrow is thrown on the stove, how
much more will he clothe you! How little
faith you have!
29 Do not set your minds on what you
are to eat or drink; do not be anxious.
30 These are all things that occupy the
minds of the Gentiles, but your Father
knows that you need them.
31 No, set your minds on his kingdom,
and the rest will come to you as well.
32 Have no fear, little flock; for your
Father has chosen to give you the
kingdom.
33 Sell your possessions and give to
charity. Provide for yourselves purses
that do not wear out, and never-failing
treasure in heaven, where no thief can
get near it, no moth destroy it.Luke 12.34–41
75
34 For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.
35 Be ready for action, with your robes
hitched up and your lamps alight.
36 Be like people who wait for their
master's return from a wedding party,
ready to let him in the moment he
arrives and knocks.
37 Happy are those servants whom the
master finds awake when he comes.
Truly I tell you: he will hitch up his robe,
seat them at table, and come and wait
on them.
38 If it is the middle of the night or
before dawn when he comes and he still
finds them awake, then are they happy
indeed.
39 Remember, if the householder had
known at what time the burglar was
coming he would not have let his house
be broken into.
40 So hold yourselves in readiness,
because the Son of Man will come at the
time you least expect him.
41 Peter said, Lord, do you intend
this parable specially for us or is it for
everyone?Luke 12.42–48
76
42 The Lord said, Who is the trusty
and sensible man whom his master will
appoint as his steward, to manage his
servants and issue their rations at the
proper time?
43 Happy that servant if his master
comes home and finds him at work!
44 I tell you this: he will be put in charge
of all his master's property.
45 But if that servant says to himself,
The master is a long time coming, and
begins to bully the menservants and
maids, and to eat and drink and get
drunk,
46 then the master will arrive on a day
when the servant does not expect him,
at a time he has not been told. He will
cut him in pieces and assign him a place
among the faithless.
47 The servant who knew his master's
wishes, yet made no attempt to carry
them out, will be flogged severely.
48 But one who did not know them
and earned a beating will be flogged
less severely. Where someone has been
given much, much will be expected of
him; and the more he has had entrustedLuke 12.49–56
77
to him the more will be demanded of
him.
49 I have come to set fire to the earth,
and how I wish it were already kindled!
50 I have a baptism to undergo, and
what constraint I am under until it is
over!
51 Do you suppose I came to establish
peace on the earth? No indeed, I have
come to bring dissension.
52 From now on, a family of five will
be divided, three against two and two
against three;
53 father against son and son against
father, mother against daughter and
daughter against mother, mother-
in-law against daughter-in-law and
daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.
54 He also said to the people, When you
see clouds gathering in the west, you
say at once, It is going to rain, and rain
it does.
55 And when the wind is from the south,
you say, It will be hot, and it is.
56 What hypocrites you are! You know
how to interpret the appearance of earth
and sky, but cannot interpret this fateful
hour.Luke 12.57–13.5
78
57 Why can you not judge for yourselves
what is right?
58 When you are going with your
opponent to court, make an effort to
reach a settlement with him while you
are still on the way; otherwise he may
drag you before the judge, and the judge
hand you over to the officer, and the
officer throw you into jail.
59 I tell you, you will not be let out until
you have paid the very last penny.
1 AT that time some people came
and told him about the Galileans
whose blood Pilate had mixed with their
sacrifices.
2 He answered them: Do you suppose
that, because these Galileans suffered
this fate, they must have been greater
sinners than anyone else in Galilee?
3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent,
you will all of you come to the same end.
4 Or the eighteen people who were
killed when the tower fell on them at
Siloam -- do you imagine they must
have been more guilty than all the other
people living in Jerusalem?
5 No, I tell you; but unless you repent,
you will all come to an end like theirs.
13Luke 13.6–14
79
6 He told them this parable: A man had
a fig tree growing in his vineyard; and
he came looking for fruit on it, but found
none.
7 So he said to the vine-dresser, For the
last three years I have come looking for
fruit on this fig tree without finding any.
Cut it down. Why should it go on taking
goodness from the soil?
8 But he replied, Leave it, sir, for this
one year, while I dig round it and manure
it.
9 And if it bears next season, well and
good; if not, you shall have it down.
10 He was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the sabbath,
11 and there was a woman there
possessed by a spirit that had crippled
her for eighteen years. She was bent
double and quite unable to stand up
straight.
12 When Jesus saw her he called her
and said, You are rid of your trouble,
13 and he laid his hands on her.
Immediately she straightened up and
began to praise God.
14 But the president of the synagogue,
indignant with Jesus for healing on theLuke 13.15–20
80
sabbath, intervened and said to the
congregation, There are six working
days: come and be cured on one of
them, and not on the sabbath.
15 The Lord gave him this answer: What
hypocrites you are! he said. Is there a
single one of you who does not loose his
ox or his donkey from its stall and take
it out to water on the sabbath?
16 And here is this woman, a daughter
of Abraham, who has been bound by
Satan for eighteen long years: was it not
right for her to be loosed from her bonds
on the sabbath?
17 At these words all his opponents were
covered with confusion, while the mass
of the people were delighted at all the
wonderful things he was doing.
18 What is the kingdom of God like? he
continued. To what shall I compare it?
19 It is like a mustard seed which a man
took and sowed in his garden; and it
grew to be a tree and the birds came to
roost among its branches.
20 Again he said, To what shall I
compare the kingdom of God?Luke 13.21–28
81
21 It is like yeast which a woman took
and mixed with three measures of flour
till it was all leavened.
22 HE continued his journey through
towns and villages, teaching as he made
his way towards Jerusalem.
23 Someone asked him, Sir, are only a
few to be saved? His answer was:
24 Make every effort to enter through
the narrow door; for I tell you that many
will try to enter but will not succeed.
25 When once the master of the house
has got up and locked the door, you may
stand outside and knock, and say, Sir, let
us in! but he will only answer, I do not
know where you come from.
26 Then you will protest, We used to eat
and drink with you, and you taught in
our streets.
27 But he will repeat, I tell you, I do not
know where you come from. Out of my
sight, all of you, you and your wicked
ways!
28 There will be wailing and grinding
of teeth there, when you see Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the
kingdom of God, and you yourselves are
driven away.Luke 13.29–35
82
29 From east and west, from north and
south, people will come and take their
places at the banquet in the kingdom of
God.
30 Yes, and some who are now last will
be first, and some who are first will be
last.
31 At that time a number of Pharisees
came and warned him, Leave this place
and be on your way; Herod wants to kill
you.
32 He replied, Go and tell that fox,
Listen: today and tomorrow I shall be
driving out demons and working cures;
on the third day I reach my goal.
33 However, I must go on my way today
and tomorrow and the next day, because
it is unthinkable for a prophet to meet
his death anywhere but in Jerusalem.
34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, city that
murders the prophets and stones the
messengers sent to her! How often have
I longed to gather your children, as a
hen gathers her brood under her wings;
but you would not let me.
35 Look! There is your temple, forsaken
by God. I tell you, you will not see me
until the time comes when you say,Luke 14.1–9
83
Blessings on him who comes in the name
of the Lord!
1 ONE sabbath he went to have
a meal in the house of one of
the leading Pharisees; and they were
watching him closely.
2 There, in front of him, was a man
suffering from dropsy,
3 and Jesus asked the lawyers and the
Pharisees: Is it permitted to heal people
on the sabbath or not?
4 They said nothing. So he took the
man, cured him, and sent him away.
5 Then he turned to them and said, If
one of you has a son or an ox that falls
into a well, will he hesitate to pull him
out on the sabbath day?
6 To this they could find no reply.
7 When he noticed how the guests were
trying to secure the places of honour, he
spoke to them in a parable:
8 When somebody asks you to a
wedding feast, do not sit down in the
place of honour. It may be that some
person more distinguished than yourself
has been invited;
9 and the host will come to say to you,
Give this man your seat. Then you will
14Luke 14.10–15
84
look foolish as you go to take the lowest
place.
10 No, when you receive an invitation,
go and sit down in the lowest place, so
that when your host comes he will say,
Come up higher, my friend. Then all
your fellow-guests will see the respect in
which you are held.
11 For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled; and whoever humbles
himself will be exalted.
12 Then he said to his host, When you
are having guests for lunch or supper, do
not invite your friends, your brothers or
other relations, or your rich neighbours;
they will only ask you back again and so
you will be repaid.
13 But when you give a party, ask the
poor, the crippled, the lame, and the
blind.
14 That is the way to find happiness,
because they have no means of repaying
you. You will be repaid on the day when
the righteous rise from the dead.
15 Hearing this one of the company said
to him, Happy are those who will sit at
the feast in the kingdom of God!Luke 14.16–23
85
16 Jesus answered, A man was giving a
big dinner party and had sent out many
invitations.
17 At dinner-time he sent his servant to
tell his guests, Come please, everything
is now ready.
18 One after another they all sent
excuses. The first said, I have bought a
piece of land, and I must go and inspect
it; please accept my apologies.
19 The second said, I have bought five
yoke of oxen, and I am on my way to try
them out; please accept my apologies.
20 The next said, I cannot come; I have
just got married.
21 When the servant came back he
reported this to his master. The master
of the house was furious and said to him,
Go out quickly into the streets and alleys
of the town, and bring in the poor, the
crippled, the blind, and the lame.
22 When the servant informed him that
his orders had been carried out and
there was still room,
23 his master replied, Go out on the
highways and along the hedgerows and
compel them to come in; I want my
house full.Luke 14.24–31
86
24 I tell you, not one of those who were
invited shall taste my banquet.
25 Once when great crowds were
accompanying him, he turned to them
and said:
26 If anyone comes to me and does not
hate his father and mother, wife and
children, brothers and sisters, even his
own life, he cannot be a disciple of mine.
27 No one who does not carry his cross
and come with me can be a disciple of
mine.
28 Would any of you think of building
a tower without first sitting down and
calculating the cost, to see whether he
could afford to finish it?
29 Otherwise, if he has laid its
foundation and then is unable to
complete it, everyone who sees it will
laugh at him.
30 There goes the man, they will say,
who started to build and could not finish.
31 Or what king will march to battle
against another king, without first
sitting down to consider whether with
ten thousand men he can face an
enemy coming to meet him with twenty
thousand?Luke 14.32–15.5
87
32 If he cannot, then, long before the
enemy approaches, he sends envoys and
asks for terms.
33 So also, if you are not prepared to
leave all your possessions behind, you
cannot be my disciples.
34 Salt is good; but if salt itself becomes
tasteless, how will it be seasoned?
35 It is useless either on the land or on
the dungheap; it can only be thrown
away. If you have ears to hear, then
hear.
1 ANOTHER time, the tax-
collectors and sinners were all
crowding in to listen to him;
2 and the Pharisees and scribes began
murmuring their disapproval: This fellow,
they said, welcomes sinners and eats
with them.
3 He answered them with this parable:
4 If one of you has a hundred sheep and
loses one of them, does he not leave
the ninety-nine in the wilderness and
go after the one that is missing until he
finds it?
5 And when he does, he lifts it joyfully
on to his shoulders,
15Luke 15.6–13
88
6 and goes home to call his friends and
neighbours together. Rejoice with me!
he cries. I have found my lost sheep.
7 In the same way, I tell you, there
will be greater joy in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninety-nine
righteous people who do not need to
repent.
8 Or again, if a woman has ten silver
coins and loses one of them, does she
not light the lamp, sweep out the house,
and look in every corner till she finds it?
9 And when she does, she calls her
friends and neighbours together, and
says, Rejoice with me! I have found the
coin that I lost.
10 In the same way, I tell you, there is
joy among the angels of God over one
sinner who repents.
11 Again he said: There was once a man
who had two sons;
12 and the younger said to his father,
Father, give me my share of the property.
So he divided his estate between them.
13 A few days later the younger son
turned the whole of his share into cash
and left home for a distant country,Luke 15.14–20
89
where he squandered it in dissolute
living.
14 He had spent it all, when a severe
famine fell upon that country and he
began to be in need.
15 So he went and attached himself to
one of the local landowners, who sent
him on to his farm to mind the pigs.
16 He would have been glad to fill his
belly with the pods that the pigs were
eating, but no one gave him anything.
17 Then he came to his senses: How
many of my father's hired servants have
more food than they can eat, he said,
and here am I, starving to death!
18 I will go at once to my father, and
say to him, Father, I have sinned against
God and against you;
19 I am no longer fit to be called your
son; treat me as one of your hired
servants.
20 So he set out for his father's house.
But while he was still a long way off his
father saw him, and his heart went out
to him; he ran to meet him, flung his
arms round him, and kissed him.Luke 15.21–29
90
21 The son said, Father, I have sinned
against God and against you; I am no
longer fit to be called your son.
22 But the father said to his servants,
Quick! Fetch a robe, the best we have,
and put it on him; put a ring on his finger
and sandals on his feet.
23 Bring the fatted calf and kill it, and
let us celebrate with a feast.
24 For this son of mine was dead and
has come back to life; he was lost and is
found. And the festivities began.
25 Now the elder son had been out on
the farm; and on his way back, as he
approached the house, he heard music
and dancing.
26 He called one of the servants and
asked what it meant.
27 The servant told him, Your brother
has come home, and your father has
killed the fatted calf because he has him
back safe and sound.
28 But he was angry and refused to go
in. His father came out and pleaded with
him;
29 but he retorted, You know how I
have slaved for you all these years; I
never once disobeyed your orders; yetLuke 15.30–16.4
91
you never gave me so much as a kid, to
celebrate with my friends.
30 But now that this son of yours turns
up, after running through your money
with his women, you kill the fatted calf
for him.
31 My boy, said the father, you are
always with me, and everything I have
is yours.
32 How could we fail to celebrate this
happy day? Your brother here was dead
and has come back to life; he was lost
and has been found.
1 HE said to his disciples, There
was a rich man who had a
steward, and he received complaints that
this man was squandering the property.
2 So he sent for him, and said, What is
this that I hear about you? Produce your
accounts, for you cannot be steward any
longer.
3 The steward said to himself, What am
I to do now that my master is going
to dismiss me from my post? I am not
strong enough to dig, and I am too proud
to beg.
4 I know what I must do, to make sure
that, when I am dismissed, there will
16Luke 16.5–11
92
be people who will take me into their
homes.
5 He summoned his master's debtors
one by one. To the first he said, How
much do you owe my master?
6 He replied, A hundred jars of olive oil.
He said, Here is your account. Sit down
and make it fifty, and be quick about it.
7 Then he said to another, And you, how
much do you owe? He said, A hundred
measures of wheat, and was told, Here
is your account; make it eighty.
8 And the master applauded the
dishonest steward for acting so astutely.
For in dealing with their own kind the
children of this world are more astute
than the children of light.
9 So I say to you, use your worldly
wealth to win friends for yourselves, so
that when money is a thing of the past
you may be received into an eternal
home.
10 Anyone who can be trusted in small
matters can be trusted also in great;
and anyone who is dishonest in small
matters is dishonest also in great.
11 If, then, you have not proved
trustworthy with the wealth of this world,Luke 16.12–18
93
who will trust you with the wealth that is
real?
12 And if you have proved untrustworthy
with what belongs to another, who will
give you anything of your own?
13 No slave can serve two masters; for
either he will hate the first and love the
second, or he will be devoted to the
first and despise the second. You cannot
serve God and Money.
14 The Pharisees, who loved money,
heard all this and scoffed at him.
15 He said to them, You are the
people who impress others with your
righteousness; but God sees through
you; for what is considered admirable in
human eyes is detestable in the sight of
God.
16 The law and the prophets were until
John: since then, the good news of
the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and
everyone forces a way in.
17 It is easier for heaven and earth to
come to an end than for one letter of the
law to lose its force.
18 A man who divorces his wife and
marries another commits adultery; andLuke 16.19–25
94
anyone who marries a woman divorced
from her husband commits adultery.
19 There was once a rich man, who used
to dress in purple and the finest linen,
and feasted sumptuously every day.
20 At his gate lay a poor man named
Lazarus, who was covered with sores.
21 He would have been glad to satisfy
his hunger with the scraps from the rich
man's table. Dogs used to come and lick
his sores.
22 One day the poor man died and was
carried away by the angels to be with
Abraham. The rich man also died and
was buried.
23 In Hades, where he was in torment,
he looked up and there, far away, was
Abraham with Lazarus close beside him.
24 Abraham, my father, he called out,
take pity on me! Send Lazarus to dip
the tip of his finger in water, to cool my
tongue, for I am in agony in this fire.
25 But Abraham said, My child,
remember that the good things fell to
you in your lifetime, and the bad to
Lazarus. Now he has his consolation here
and it is you who are in agony.Luke 16.26–17.2
95
26 But that is not all: there is a great
gulf fixed between us; no one can cross
it from our side to reach you, and none
may pass from your side to us.
27 Then, father, he replied, will you send
him to my father's house,
28 where I have five brothers, to warn
them, so that they may not come to this
place of torment?
29 But Abraham said, They have Moses
and the prophets; let them listen to
them.
30 No, father Abraham, he replied, but
if someone from the dead visits them,
they will repent.
31 Abraham answered, If they do not
listen to Moses and the prophets they
will pay no heed even if someone should
rise from the dead.
1 HE said to his disciples, There
are bound to be causes of
stumbling; but woe betide the person
through whom they come.
2 It would be better for him to be thrown
into the sea with a millstone round his
neck than to cause the downfall of one
of these little ones.
17Luke 17.3–10
96
3 So be on your guard. If your brother
does wrong, reprove him; and if he
repents, forgive him.
4 Even if he wrongs you seven times in a
day and comes back to you seven times
saying, I am sorry, you are to forgive
him.
5 The apostles said to the Lord, Increase
our faith;
6 and the Lord replied, If you had faith
no bigger than a mustard seed, you
could say to this mulberry tree, Be
rooted up and planted in the sea; and it
would obey you.
7 Suppose one of you has a servant
ploughing or minding sheep. When he
comes in from the fields, will the master
say, Come and sit down straight away?
8 Will he not rather say, Prepare my
supper; hitch up your robe, and wait on
me while I have my meal. You can have
yours afterwards?
9 Is he grateful to the servant for
carrying out his orders?
10 So with you: when you have carried
out all you have been ordered to do, you
should say, We are servants and deserve
no credit; we have only done our duty.Luke 17.11–20
97
11 In the course of his journey to
Jerusalem he was travelling through the
borderlands of Samaria and Galilee.
12 As he was entering a village he was
met by ten men with leprosy. They stood
some way off
13 and called out to him, Jesus, Master,
take pity on us.
14 When he saw them he said, Go and
show yourselves to the priests; and
while they were on their way, they were
made clean.
15 One of them, finding himself cured,
turned back with shouts of praise to God.
16 He threw himself down at Jesus's
feet and thanked him. And he was a
Samaritan.
17 At this Jesus said: Were not all ten
made clean? The other nine, where are
they?
18 Was no one found returning to give
praise to God except this foreigner?
19 And he said to the man, Stand up
and go on your way; your faith has cured
you.
20 THE Pharisees asked him, When will
the kingdom of God come? He answered,Luke 17.21–28
98
You cannot tell by observation when the
kingdom of God comes.
21 You cannot say, Look, here it is, or
There it is! For the kingdom of God is
among you!
22 He said to the disciples, The time will
come when you will long to see one of
the days of the Son of Man and will not
see it.
23 They will say to you, Look! There!
and Look! Here! Do not go running off in
pursuit.
24 For like a lightning-flash, that lights
up the earth from end to end, will the
Son of Man be in his day.
25 But first he must endure much
suffering and be rejected by this
generation.
26 As it was in the days of Noah, so will
it be in the days of the Son of Man.
27 They ate and drank and married,
until the day that Noah went into the ark
and the flood came and made an end of
them all.
28 So too in the days of Lot, they ate
and drank, they bought and sold, they
planted and built;Luke 17.29–18.1
99
29 but on the day that Lot left Sodom,
fire and sulphur rained from the sky and
made an end of them all.
30 It will be like that on the day when
the Son of Man is revealed.
31 On that day if anyone is on the roof
while his belongings are in the house, he
must not go down to fetch them; and if
anyone is in the field, he must not turn
back.
32 Remember Lot's wife.
33 Whoever seeks to preserve his life
will lose it; and whoever loses his life will
gain it.
34 I tell you, on that night there will be
two people in one bed: one will be taken,
the other left.
35 There will be two women together
grinding corn: one will be taken, the
other left.
36 [[EMPTY]]
37 When they heard this they asked,
Where, Lord? He said, Where the carcass
is, there will the vultures gather.
1 HE told them a parable to show
that they should keep on praying
and never lose heart:
18Luke 18.2–11
100
2 In a certain city there was a judge who
had no fear of God or respect for man,
3 and in the same city there was a
widow who kept coming before him to
demand justice against her opponent.
4 For a time he refused; but in the end
he said to himself, Although I have no
fear of God or respect for man,
5 yet this widow is so great a nuisance
that I will give her justice before she
wears me out with her persistence.
6 The Lord said, You hear what the
unjust judge says.
7 Then will not God give justice to his
chosen, to whom he listens patiently
while they cry out to him day and night?
8 I tell you, he will give them justice
soon enough. But when the Son of Man
comes, will he find faith on earth?
9 Here is another parable that he told;
it was aimed at those who were sure of
their own goodness and looked down on
everyone else.
10 Two men went up to the temple to
pray, one a Pharisee and the other a
tax-collector.
11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed
this prayer: I thank you, God, that I amLuke 18.12–18
101
not like the rest of mankind -- greedy,
dishonest, adulterous -- or, for that
matter, like this tax-collector.
12 I fast twice a week; I pay tithes on all
that I get.
13 But the other kept his distance and
would not even raise his eyes to heaven,
but beat upon his breast, saying, God,
have mercy on me, sinner that I am.
14 It was this man, I tell you, and not
the other, who went home acquitted of
his sins. For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled; and whoever humbles
himself will be exalted.
15 They brought babies for him to touch,
and when the disciples saw them they
rebuked them.
16 But Jesus called for the children and
said, Let the children come to me; do
not try to stop them; for the kingdom of
God belongs to such as these.
17 Truly I tell you: whoever does not
accept the kingdom of God like a child
will never enter it.
18 One of the rulers put this question to
him: Good Teacher, what must I do to
win eternal life?Luke 18.19–28
102
19 Jesus said to him, Why do you call
me good? No one is good except God
alone.
20 You know the commandments: Do
not commit adultery; do not murder; do
not steal; do not give false evidence;
honour your father and mother.
21 The man answered, I have kept all
these since I was a boy.
22 On hearing this Jesus said, There is
still one thing you lack: sell everything
you have and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven; then come
and follow me.
23 When he heard this his heart sank,
for he was a very rich man.
24 When Jesus saw it he said, How hard
it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom
of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of God.
26 Those who heard asked, Then who
can be saved?
27 He answered, What is impossible for
men is possible for God.
28 Peter said, What about us? We left all
we had to follow you.Luke 18.29–38
103
29 Jesus said to them, Truly I tell you:
there is no one who has given up home,
or wife, brothers, parents, or children,
for the sake of the kingdom of God,
30 who will not be repaid many times
over in this age, and in the age to come
have eternal life.
31 HE took the Twelve aside and said,
We are now going up to Jerusalem;
and everything that was written by the
prophets will find its fulfilment in the Son
of Man.
32 He will be handed over to the
Gentiles. He will be mocked, maltreated,
and spat upon;
33 they will flog him and kill him; and on
the third day he will rise again.
34 But they did not understand this at
all or grasp what he was talking about;
its meaning was concealed from them.
35 As he approached Jericho a blind man
sat at the roadside begging.
36 Hearing a crowd going past, he asked
what was happening,
37 and was told that Jesus of Nazareth
was passing by.
38 Then he called out, Jesus, Son of
David, have pity on me.Luke 18.39–19.5
104
39 The people in front told him to hold
his tongue; but he shouted all the more,
Son of David, have pity on me.
40 Jesus stopped and ordered the man
to be brought to him. When he came up
Jesus asked him,
41 What do you want me to do for you?
Sir, I want my sight back, he answered.
42 Jesus said to him, Have back your
sight; your faith has healed you.
43 He recovered his sight instantly and
followed Jesus, praising God. And all the
people gave praise to God for what they
had seen.
1 Entering Jericho he made his
way through the city.
2 There was a man there named
Zacchaeus; he was superintendent of
taxes and very rich.
3 He was eager to see what Jesus looked
like; but, being a little man, he could not
see him for the crowd.
4 So he ran on ahead and climbed a
sycomore tree in order to see him, for
he was to pass that way.
5 When Jesus came to the place, he
looked up and said, Zacchaeus, be quick
19Luke 19.6–13
105
and come down, for I must stay at your
house today.
6 He climbed down as quickly as he
could and welcomed him gladly.
7 At this there was a general murmur
of disapproval. He has gone in to be the
guest of a sinner, they said.
8 But Zacchaeus stood there and said to
the Lord, Here and now, sir, I give half
my possessions to charity; and if I have
defrauded anyone, I will repay him four
times over.
9 Jesus said to him, Today salvation has
come to this house -- for this man too is
a son of Abraham.
10 The Son of Man has come to seek
and to save what is lost.
11 While they were listening to this, he
went on to tell them a parable, because
he was now close to Jerusalem and they
thought the kingdom of God might dawn
at any moment.
12 He said, A man of noble birth went on
a long journey abroad, to have himself
appointed king and then return.
13 But first he called ten of his servants
and gave them each a sum of money,
saying, Trade with this while I am away.Luke 19.14–22
106
14 His fellow-citizens hated him and
sent a delegation after him to say, We do
not want this man as our king.
15 He returned however as king, and
sent for the servants to whom he had
given the money, to find out what profit
each had made.
16 The first came and said, Your money,
sir, has increased tenfold.
17 Well done, he replied; you are a
good servant. Because you have shown
yourself trustworthy in a very small
matter, you shall have charge of ten
cities.
18 The second came and said, Your
money, sir, has increased fivefold;
19 and he was told, You shall be in
charge of five cities.
20 The third came and said, Here is your
money, sir; I kept it wrapped up in a
handkerchief.
21 I was afraid of you, because you are
a hard man: you draw out what you did
not put in and reap what you did not
sow.
22 You scoundrel! he replied. I will
condemn you out of your own mouth.
You knew me to be a hard man, did you,Luke 19.23–31
107
drawing out what I never put in, and
reaping what I did not sow?
23 Then why did you not put my money
on deposit, and I could have claimed it
with interest when I came back?
24 Turning to his attendants he said,
Take the money from him and give it to
the man with the most.
25 But, sir, they replied, he has ten
times as much already.
26 I tell you, he said, everyone who has
will be given more; but whoever has
nothing will forfeit even what he has.
27 But as for those enemies of mine
who did not want me for their king, bring
them here and slaughter them in my
presence.
28 WITH that Jesus set out on the ascent
to Jerusalem.
29 As he approached Bethphage and
Bethany at the hill called Olivet, he sent
off two of the disciples,
30 telling them: Go into the village
opposite; as you enter it you will find
tethered there a colt which no one has
yet ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
31 If anyone asks why you are untying
it, say, The Master needs it.Luke 19.32–41
108
32 The two went on their errand and
found everything just as he had told
them.
33 As they were untying the colt, its
owners asked, Why are you untying that
colt?
34 They answered, The Master needs it.
35 So they brought the colt to Jesus,
and threw their cloaks on it for Jesus to
mount.
36 As he went along people laid their
cloaks on the road.
37 And when he reached the descent
from the mount of Olives, the whole
company of his disciples in their joy
began to sing aloud the praises of God
for all the great things they had seen:
38 Blessed is he who comes as king in
the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven,
glory in highest heaven!
39 Some Pharisees in the crowd said to
him, Teacher, restrain your disciples.
40 He answered, I tell you, if my
disciples are silent the stones will shout
aloud.
41 When he came in sight of the city, he
wept over itLuke 19.42–20.1
109
42 and said, If only you had known this
day the way that leads to peace! But no;
it is hidden from your sight.
43 For a time will come upon you, when
your enemies will set up siege-works
against you; they will encircle you and
hem you in at every point;
44 they will bring you to the ground,
you and your children within your walls,
and not leave you one stone standing on
another, because you did not recognize
the time of God's visitation.
45 Then he went into the temple and
began driving out the traders,
46 with these words: Scripture says, My
house shall be a house of prayer; but
you have made it a bandits cave.'
47 Day by day he taught in the temple.
The chief priests and scribes, with the
support of the leading citizens, wanted
to bring about his death,
48 but found they were helpless,
because the people all hung on his
words.
1 ONE day, as he was teaching the
people in the temple and telling
them the good news, the chief priests
20Luke 20.2–10
110
and scribes, accompanied by the elders,
confronted him.
2 Tell us, they said, by what authority
you are acting like this; who gave you
this authority?
3 He answered them, I also have a
question for you: tell me,
4 was the baptism of John from God or
from man?
5 This set them arguing among
themselves: If we say, From God, he will
say, Why did you not believe him?
6 And if we say, From man, the people
will all stone us, for they are convinced
that John was a prophet.
7 So they answered that they could not
tell.
8 And Jesus said to them, Then neither
will I tell you by what authority I act.
9 He went on to tell the people this
parable: A man planted a vineyard, let it
out to vine-growers, and went abroad
for a long time.
10 When the season came, he sent a
servant to the tenants to collect from
them his share of the produce; but the
tenants thrashed him and sent him away
empty-handed.Luke 20.11–18
111
11 He tried again and sent a second
servant; but they thrashed him too,
treated him outrageously, and sent him
away empty-handed.
12 He tried once more and sent a third;
him too they wounded and flung out.
13 Then the owner of the vineyard said,
What am I to do? I will send my beloved
son; perhaps they will respect him.
14 But when the tenants saw him they
discussed what they should do. This is
the heir, they said; let us kill him so that
the inheritance may come to us.
15 So they flung him out of the vineyard
and killed him. What, therefore, will the
owner of the vineyard do to them?
16 He will come and put those tenants
to death and give the vineyard to others.
When they heard this, they said, God
forbid!
17 But he looked straight at them
and said, Then what does this text of
scripture mean: The stone which the
builders rejected has become the main
corner-stone?
18 Everyone who falls on that stone will
be dashed to pieces; anyone on whom it
falls will be crushed.Luke 20.19–26
112
19 The scribes and chief priests wanted
to seize him there and then, for they saw
that this parable was aimed at them; but
they were afraid of the people.
20 So they watched their opportunity
and sent agents in the guise of honest
men, to seize on some word of his that
they could use as a pretext for handing
him over to the authority and jurisdiction
of the governor.
21 They put a question to him: Teacher,
they said, we know that what you speak
and teach is sound; you pay deference
to no one, but teach in all sincerity the
way of life that God requires.
22 Are we or are we not permitted to
pay taxes to the Roman emperor?
23 He saw through their trick and said,
24 Show me a silver piece. Whose head
does it bear, and whose inscription?
Caesar's, they replied.
25 Very well then, he said, pay to Caesar
what belongs to Caesar, and to God what
belongs to God.
26 Thus their attempt to catch him out
in public failed, and, taken aback by his
reply, they fell silent.Luke 20.27–36
113
27 Then some Sadducees, who deny that
there is a resurrection, came forward
and asked:
28 Teacher, Moses laid it down for us
that if there are brothers, and one dies
leaving a wife but no child, then the next
should marry the widow and provide an
heir for his brother.
29 Now, there were seven brothers: the
first took a wife and died childless;
30 then the second married her,
31 then the third. In this way the seven
of them died leaving no children.
32 Last of all the woman also died.
33 At the resurrection, therefore, whose
wife is she to be, since all seven had
married her?
34 Jesus said to them, The men and
women of this world marry;
35 but those who have been judged
worthy of a place in the other world, and
of the resurrection from the dead, do not
marry,
36 for they are no longer subject to
death. They are like angels; they are
children of God, because they share in
the resurrection.Luke 20.37–46
114
37 That the dead are raised to life again
is shown by Moses himself in the story of
the burning bush, when he calls the Lord
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
the God of Jacob.
38 God is not God of the dead but of the
living; in his sight all are alive.
39 At this some of the scribes said, Well
spoken, Teacher.
40 And nobody dared put any further
question to him.
41 He said to them, How can they say
that the Messiah is David's son?
42 For David himself says in the book of
Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at
my right hand
43 until I make your enemies your
footstool.
44 Thus David calls him Lord; how then
can he be David's son?'
45 In the hearing of all the people Jesus
said to his disciples:
46 Beware of the scribes, who like to
walk up and down in long robes, and love
to be greeted respectfully in the street,
to have the chief seats in synagogues
and places of honour at feasts.Luke 20.47–21.8
115
47 These are the men who eat up the
property of widows, while for appearance
sake they say long prayers; the sentence
they receive will be all the more severe.'
1 AS JESUS looked up and saw
rich people dropping their gifts
into the chest of the temple treasury,
2 he noticed a poor widow putting in
two tiny coins.
3 I tell you this, he said: this poor widow
has given more than any of them;
4 for those others who have given had
more than enough, but she, with less
than enough, has given all she had to
live on.
5 SOME people were talking about the
temple and the beauty of its fine stones
and ornaments. He said,
6 These things you are gazing at -- the
time will come when not one stone will
be left upon another; they will all be
thrown down.
7 Teacher, they asked, when will that
be? What will be the sign that these
things are about to happen?
8 He said, Take care that you are not
misled. For many will come claiming my
21Luke 21.9–16
116
name and saying, I am he, and, The
time has come. Do not follow them.
9 And when you hear of wars and
insurrections, do not panic. These things
are bound to happen first; but the end
does not follow at once.
10 Then he added, Nation will go to
war against nation, kingdom against
kingdom;
11 there will be severe earthquakes,
famines and plagues in many places, and
in the sky terrors and great portents.
12 But before all this happens they will
seize you and persecute you. You will
be handed over to synagogues and put
in prison; you will be haled before kings
and governors for your allegiance to me.
13 This will be your opportunity to
testify.
14 So resolve not to prepare your
defence beforehand,
15 because I myself will give you such
words and wisdom as no opponent can
resist or refute.
16 Even your parents and brothers, your
relations and friends, will betray you.
Some of you will be put to death;Luke 21.17–25
117
17 and everyone will hate you for your
allegiance to me.
18 But not a hair of your head will be
lost.
19 By standing firm you will win
yourselves life.
20 But when you see Jerusalem encircled
by armies, then you may be sure that
her devastation is near.
21 Then those who are in Judaea must
take to the hills; those who are in the
city itself must leave it, and those who
are out in the country must not return;
22 because this is the time of retribution,
when all that stands written is to be
fulfilled.
23 Alas for women with child in those
days, and for those who have children at
the breast! There will be great distress
in the land and a terrible judgement on
this people.
24 They will fall by the sword; they will
be carried captive into all countries; and
Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by
Gentiles until the day of the Gentiles has
run its course.
25 Portents will appear in sun and moon
and stars. On earth nations will standLuke 21.26–34
118
helpless, not knowing which way to turn
from the roar and surge of the sea.
26 People will faint with terror at the
thought of all that is coming upon the
world; for the celestial powers will be
shaken.
27 Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great
glory.
28 When all this begins to happen,
stand upright and hold your heads high,
because your liberation is near.
29 He told them a parable: Look at the
fig tree, or at any other tree.
30 As soon as it buds, you can see for
yourselves that summer is near.
31 In the same way, when you see all
this happening, you may know that the
kingdom of God is near.
32 Truly I tell you: the present
generation will live to see it all.
33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will never pass away.
34 Be on your guard; do not let your
minds be dulled by dissipation and
drunkenness and worldly cares so that
the great day catches you suddenlyLuke 21.35–22.5
119
35 like a trap; for that day will come on
everyone, the whole world over.
36 Be on the alert, praying at all times
for strength to pass safely through
all that is coming and to stand in the
presence of the Son of Man.
37 His days were given to teaching in
the temple; every evening he would
leave the city and spend the night on the
hill called Olivet.
38 And in the early morning the people
flocked to listen to him in the temple.
1 THE festival of Unleavened
Bread, known as Passover, was
approaching,
2 and the chief priests and the scribes
were trying to devise some means of
doing away with him; for they were
afraid of the people.
3 Then Satan entered into Judas, who
was called Iscariot, one of the Twelve;
4 and he went to the chief priests
and temple guards to discuss ways of
betraying Jesus to them.
5 They were glad and undertook to pay
him a sum of money.
22Luke 22.6–14
120
6 He agreed, and began to look for
an opportunity to betray him to them
without collecting a crowd.
7 Then came the day of Unleavened
Bread, on which the Passover lambs had
to be slaughtered,
8 and Jesus sent off Peter and John,
saying, Go and prepare the Passover
supper for us.
9 Where would you like us to make the
preparations? they asked.
10 He replied, As soon as you set foot in
the city a man will meet you carrying a
jar of water. Follow him into the house
that he enters
11 and give this message to the
householder: The Teacher says, Where
is the room in which I am to eat the
Passover with my disciples?
12 He will show you a large room upstairs
all set out: make the preparations there.'
13 They went and found everything
as he had said. So they prepared for
Passover.
14 When the hour came he took his
place at table, and the apostles with
him;Luke 22.15–24
121
15 and he said to them, How I have
longed to eat this Passover with you
before my death!
16 For I tell you, never again shall I
eat it until the time when it finds its
fulfilment in the kingdom of God.
17 Then he took a cup, and after giving
thanks he said, Take this and share it
among yourselves;
18 for I tell you, from this moment
I shall not drink the fruit of the vine
until the time when the kingdom of God
comes.
19 Then he took bread, and after giving
thanks he broke it, and gave it to them
with the words: This is my body.
20 [[EMPTY]]
21 Even now my betrayer is here, his
hand with mine on the table.
22 For the Son of Man is going his
appointed way; but alas for that man by
whom he is betrayed!
23 At that they began to ask among
themselves which of them it could
possibly be who was to do this.
24 Then a dispute began as to which of
them should be considered the greatest.Luke 22.25–33
122
25 But he said, Among the Gentiles,
kings lord it over their subjects; and
those in authority are given the title
Benefactor.
26 Not so with you: on the contrary, the
greatest among you must bear himself
like the youngest, the one who rules like
one who serves.
27 For who is greater -- the one who
sits at table or the servant who waits on
him? Surely the one who sits at table.
Yet I am among you like a servant.
28 You have stood firmly by me in my
times of trial;
29 and I now entrust to you the kingdom
which my Father entrusted to me;
30 in my kingdom you shall eat and
drink at my table and sit on thrones as
judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.
31 Simon, Simon, take heed: Satan has
been given leave to sift all of you like
wheat;
32 but I have prayed for you, Simon,
that your faith may not fail; and when
you are restored, give strength to your
brothers.
33 Lord, he replied, I am ready to go
with you to prison and to death.Luke 22.34–41
123
34 Jesus said, I tell you, Peter, the cock
will not crow tonight until you have
denied three times over that you know
me.
35 He said to them, When I sent you
out barefoot without purse or pack, were
you ever short of anything? No, they
answered.
36 It is different now, he said; whoever
has a purse had better take it with him,
and his pack too; and if he has no sword,
let him sell his cloak to buy one.
37 For scripture says, And he was
reckoned among transgressors, and this,
I tell you, must be fulfilled in me; indeed,
all that is written of me is reaching its
fulfilment.
38 Lord, they said, we have two swords
here. Enough! he replied.
39 THEN he went out and made his
way as usual to the mount of Olives,
accompanied by the disciples.
40 When he reached the place he said to
them, Pray that you may be spared the
test.
41 He himself withdrew from them about
a stone's throw, knelt down, and began
to pray:Luke 22.42–50
124
42 Father, if it be your will, take this cup
from me. Yet not my will but yours be
done.
43 And now there appeared to him
an angel from heaven bringing him
strength,
44 and in anguish of spirit he prayed the
more urgently; and his sweat was like
drops of blood falling to the ground.
45 When he rose from prayer and came
to the disciples he found them asleep,
worn out by grief.
46 Why are you sleeping? he said. Rise
and pray that you may be spared the
test.
47 WHILE he was still speaking a crowd
appeared with the man called Judas, one
of the Twelve, at their head. He came up
to Jesus to kiss him;
48 but Jesus said, Judas, would you
betray the Son of Man with a kiss?
49 When his followers saw what was
coming, they said, Lord, shall we use our
swords?
50 And one of them struck at the high
priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.Luke 22.51–58
125
51 But Jesus answered, Stop! No more
of that! Then he touched the man's ear
and healed him.
52 Turning to the chief priests, the
temple guards, and the elders, who had
come to seize him, he said, Do you take
me for a robber, that you have come out
with swords and cudgels?
53 Day after day, I have been with you
in the temple, and you did not raise a
hand against me. But this is your hour --
when darkness reigns.
54 Then they arrested him and led him
away. They brought him to the high
priest's house, and Peter followed at a
distance.
55 They lit a fire in the middle of the
courtyard and sat round it, and Peter sat
among them.
56 A serving-maid who saw him sitting
in the firelight stared at him and said,
This man was with him too.
57 But he denied it: I do not know him,
he said.
58 A little later a man noticed him and
said, You also are one of them. But Peter
said to him, No, I am not.Luke 22.59–67
126
59 About an hour passed and someone
else spoke more strongly still: Of course
he was with him. He must have been; he
is a Galilean.
60 But Peter said, I do not know what
you are talking about. At that moment,
while he was still speaking, a cock
crowed;
61 and the Lord turned and looked at
Peter. Peter remembered the Lord's
words, Tonight before the cock crows
you will disown me three times.
62 And he went outside, and wept
bitterly.
63 The men who were guarding Jesus
mocked him. They beat him,
64 they blindfolded him, and kept asking
him, If you are a prophet, tell us who hit
you.
65 And so they went on heaping insults
upon him.
66 AS SOON as it was day, the elders
of the people, chief priests, and scribes
assembled, and he was brought before
their Council.
67 Tell us, they said, are you the
Messiah? If I tell you, he replied, you will
not believe me;Luke 22.68–23.5
127
68 and if I ask questions, you will not
answer.
69 But from now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of Almighty
God.
70 You are the Son of God, then? they
all said, and he replied, It is you who say
I am.
71 At that they said, What further
evidence do we need? We have heard
this ourselves from his own lips.
1 With that the whole assembly
rose and brought him before
Pilate.
2 They opened the case against him by
saying, We found this man subverting
our nation, opposing the payment of
taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be
Messiah, a king.
3 Pilate asked him, Are you the king
of the Jews? He replied, The words are
yours.
4 Pilate then said to the chief priests
and the crowd, I find no case for this
man to answer.
5 But they insisted: His teaching is
causing unrest among the people all
23Luke 23.6–13
128
over Judaea. It started from Galilee and
now has spread here.
6 When Pilate heard this, he asked if the
man was a Galilean,
7 and on learning that he belonged to
Herod's jurisdiction he remitted the case
to him, for Herod was also in Jerusalem
at that time.
8 When Herod saw Jesus he was greatly
pleased; he had heard about him and
had long been wanting to see him in
the hope of witnessing some miracle
performed by him.
9 He questioned him at some length
without getting any reply;
10 but the chief priests and scribes
appeared and pressed the case against
him vigorously.
11 Then Herod and his troops treated
him with contempt and ridicule, and sent
him back to Pilate dressed in a gorgeous
robe.
12 That same day Herod and Pilate
became friends; till then there had been
a feud between them.
13 Pilate now summoned the chief
priests, councillors, and people,Luke 23.14–22
129
14 and said to them, You brought
this man before me on a charge of
subversion. But, as you see, I have
myself examined him in your presence
and found nothing in him to support your
charges.
15 No more did Herod, for he has
referred him back to us. Clearly he has
done nothing to deserve death.
16 I therefore propose to flog him and
let him go.
17 [[EMPTY]]
18 But there was a general outcry. Away
with him! Set Barabbas free!
19 (Now Barabbas had been put in
prison for his part in a rising in the city
and for murder.)
20 Pilate addressed them again, in his
desire to release Jesus,
21 but they shouted back, Crucify him,
crucify him!
22 For the third time he spoke to them:
Why, what wrong has he done? I have
not found him guilty of any capital
offence. I will therefore flog him and let
him go.Luke 23.23–30
130
23 But they persisted with their demand,
shouting that Jesus should be crucified.
Their shouts prevailed,
24 and Pilate decided that they should
have their way.
25 He released the man they asked for,
the man who had been put in prison for
insurrection and murder, and gave Jesus
over to their will.
26 AS THEY led him away to execution
they took hold of a man called Simon,
from Cyrene, on his way in from the
country; putting the cross on his back
they made him carry it behind Jesus.
27 Great numbers of people followed,
among them many women who mourned
and lamented over him.
28 Jesus turned to them and said,
Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep
for me; weep for yourselves and your
children.
29 For the days are surely coming when
people will say, Happy are the barren,
the wombs that never bore a child, the
breasts that never fed one.
30 Then they will begin to say to the
mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills,
Cover us.Luke 23.31–39
131
31 For if these things are done when the
wood is green, what will happen when it
is dry?
32 There were two others with him,
criminals who were being led out to
execution;
33 and when they reached the place
called The Skull, they crucified him
there, and the criminals with him, one
on his right and the other on his left.
34 Jesus said, Father, forgive them; they
do not know what they are doing. They
shared out his clothes by casting lots.
35 The people stood looking on, and
their rulers jeered at him: He saved
others: now let him save himself, if this
is God's Messiah, his Chosen.
36 The soldiers joined in the mockery
and came forward offering him sour
wine.
37 If you are the king of the Jews, they
said, save yourself.
38 There was an inscription above his
head which ran: This is the king of the
Jews.
39 One of the criminals hanging there
taunted him: Are not you the Messiah?
Save yourself, and us.Luke 23.40–49
132
40 But the other rebuked him: Have you
no fear of God? You are under the same
sentence as he is.
41 In our case it is plain justice; we are
paying the price for our misdeeds. But
this man has done nothing wrong.
42 And he said, Jesus, remember me
when you come to your throne.
43 Jesus answered, Truly I tell you:
today you will be with me in Paradise.
44 By now it was about midday and a
darkness fell over the whole land, which
lasted until three in the afternoon:
45 the sun's light failed. And the curtain
of the temple was torn in two.
46 Then Jesus uttered a loud cry and
said, Father, into your hands I commit
my spirit; and with these words he died.
47 When the centurion saw what had
happened, he gave praise to God.
Beyond all doubt, he said, this man was
innocent.
48 The crowd who had assembled for
the spectacle, when they saw what had
happened, went home beating their
breasts.
49 HIS friends had all been standing
at a distance; the women who hadLuke 23.50–56
133
accompanied him from Galilee stood
with them and watched it all.
50 Now there was a man called Joseph,
a member of the Council, a good and
upright man,
51 who had dissented from their policy
and the action they had taken. He came
from the Judaean town of Arimathaea,
and he was one who looked forward to
the kingdom of God.
52 This man now approached Pilate and
asked for the body of Jesus.
53 Taking it down from the cross, he
wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid it in
a tomb cut out of the rock, in which no
one had been laid before.
54 It was the day of preparation, and
the sabbath was about to begin.
55 The women who had accompanied
Jesus from Galilee followed; they took
note of the tomb and saw his body laid
in it.
56 Then they went home and prepared
spices and perfumes; and on the
sabbath they rested in obedience to the
commandment.Luke 24.1–10
134
1 BUT very early on the first day of
24 the week they came to the tomb
bringing the spices they had prepared.
2 They found that the stone had been
rolled away from the tomb,
3 but when they went inside, they did
not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
4 While they stood utterly at a loss,
suddenly two men in dazzling garments
were at their side.
5 They were terrified, and stood with
eyes cast down, but the men said, Why
search among the dead for one who is
alive?
6 Remember how he told you, while he
was still in Galilee,
7 that the Son of Man must be given into
the power of sinful men and be crucified,
and must rise again on the third day.
8 Then they recalled his words
9 and, returning from the tomb, they
reported everything to the eleven and all
the others.
10 The women were Mary of Magdala,
Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,
and they, with the other women, told
these things to the apostles.Luke 24.11–19
135
11 But the story appeared to them to be
nonsense, and they would not believe
them.
12 [[EMPTY]]
13 THAT same day two of them were on
their way to a village called Emmaus,
about seven miles from Jerusalem,
14 talking together about all that had
happened.
15 As they talked and argued, Jesus
himself came up and walked with them;
16 but something prevented them from
recognizing him.
17 He asked them, What is it you are
debating as you walk? They stood still,
their faces full of sadness,
18 and one, called Cleopas, answered,
Are you the only person staying in
Jerusalem not to have heard the news of
what has happened there in the last few
days?
19 What news? he said. About Jesus of
Nazareth, they replied, who, by deeds
and words of power, proved himself a
prophet in the sight of God and the
whole people;Luke 24.20–27
136
20 and how our chief priests and rulers
handed him over to be sentenced to
death, and crucified him.
21 But we had been hoping that he
was to be the liberator of Israel. What
is more, this is the third day since it
happened,
22 and now some women of our
company have astounded us: they went
early to the tomb,
23 but failed to find his body, and
returned with a story that they had seen
a vision of angels who told them he was
alive.
24 Then some of our people went to
the tomb and found things just as the
women had said; but him they did not
see.
25 How dull you are! he answered. How
slow to believe all that the prophets said!
26 Was not the Messiah bound to suffer
in this way before entering upon his
glory?
27 Then, starting from Moses and all
the prophets, he explained to them in
the whole of scripture the things that
referred to himself.Luke 24.28–35
137
28 By this time they had reached the
village to which they were going, and he
made as if to continue his journey.
29 But they pressed him: Stay with us,
for evening approaches, and the day is
almost over. So he went in to stay with
them.
30 And when he had sat down with
them at table, he took bread and said
the blessing; he broke the bread, and
offered it to them.
31 Then their eyes were opened, and
they recognized him; but he vanished
from their sight.
32 They said to one another, Were not
our hearts on fire as he talked with us on
the road and explained the scriptures to
us?
33 Without a moment's delay they set
out and returned to Jerusalem. There
they found that the eleven and the rest
of the company had assembled,
34 and were saying, It is true: the Lord
has risen; he has appeared to Simon.
35 Then they described what had
happened on their journey and told how
he had made himself known to them in
the breaking of the bread.Luke 24.36–45
138
36 As they were talking about all this,
there he was, standing among them.
37 Startled and terrified, they thought
they were seeing a ghost.
38 But he said, Why are you so
perturbed? Why do doubts arise in your
minds?
39 Look at my hands and feet. It is I
myself. Touch me and see; no ghost has
flesh and bones as you can see that I
have.
40 [[EMPTY]]
41 They were still incredulous, still
astounded, for it seemed too good to
be true. So he asked them, Have you
anything here to eat?
42 They offered him a piece of fish they
had cooked,
43 which he took and ate before their
eyes.
44 And he said to them, This is what I
meant by saying, while I was still with
you, that everything written about me
in the law of Moses and in the prophets
and psalms was bound to be fulfilled.
45 Then he opened their minds to
understand the scriptures.Luke 24.46–53
139
46 So you see, he said, that scripture
foretells the sufferings of the Messiah
and his rising from the dead on the third
day,
47 and declares that in his name
repentance bringing the forgiveness of
sins is to be proclaimed to all nations
beginning from Jerusalem.
48 You are to be witnesses to it all.
49 I am sending on you the gift promised
by my Father; wait here in this city until
you are armed with power from above.
50 Then he led them out as far as
Bethany, and blessed them with uplifted
hands;
51 and in the act of blessing he parted
from them.
52 And they returned to Jerusalem full
of joy,
53 and spent all their time in the temple
praising God.John
1 IN the beginning the Word already
1 was. The Word was in God's
presence, and what God was, the Word
was.
2 He was with God at the beginning,
3 and through him all things came to
be; without him no created thing came
into being.
4 In him was life, and that life was the
light of mankind.
5 The light shines in the darkness, and
the darkness has never mastered it.
6 There appeared a man named John.
He was sent from God,
7 and came as a witness to testify to
the light, so that through him all might
become believers.
8 He was not himself the light; he came
to bear witness to the light.
9 The true light which gives light to
everyone was even then coming into the
world.John 1.10–18
2
10 He was in the world; but the world,
though it owed its being to him, did not
recognize him.
11 He came to his own, and his own
people would not accept him.
12 But to all who did accept him, to
those who put their trust in him, he gave
the right to become children of God,
13 born not of human stock, by the
physical desire of a human father, but of
God.
14 So the Word became flesh; he made
his home among us, and we saw his
glory, such glory as befits the Father's
only Son, full of grace and truth.
15 John bore witness to him and
proclaimed: This is the man of whom
I said, He comes after me, but ranks
ahead of me; before I was born, he
already was.
16 From his full store we have all
received grace upon grace;
17 for the law was given through Moses,
but grace and truth came through Jesus
Christ.
18 No one has ever seen God; God's only
Son, he who is nearest to the Father's
heart, has made him known.John 1.19–27
3
19 THIS is the testimony John gave
when the Jews of Jerusalem sent a
deputation of priests and Levites to ask
him who he was.
20 He readily acknowledged, I am not
the Messiah.
21 What then? Are you Elijah? I am not,
he replied. Are you the Prophet? No, he
said.
22 Then who are you? they asked.
We must give an answer to those who
sent us. What account do you give of
yourself?
23 He answered in the words of the
prophet Isaiah: I am a voice crying in
the wilderness, Make straight the way
for the Lord.
24 Some Pharisees who were in the
deputation
25 asked him, If you are not the
Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet,
then why are you baptizing?
26 I baptize in water, John replied, but
among you, though you do not know
him, stands the one
27 who is to come after me. I am not
worthy to unfasten the strap of his
sandal.John 1.28–36
4
28 This took place at Bethany beyond
Jordan, where John was baptizing.
29 The next day he saw Jesus coming
towards him. There is the Lamb of God,
he said, who takes away the sin of the
world.
30 He it is of whom I said, After me
there comes a man who ranks ahead of
me; before I was born, he already was.
31 I did not know who he was; but the
reason why I came, baptizing in water,
was that he might be revealed to Israel.
32 John testified again: I saw the Spirit
come down from heaven like a dove and
come to rest on him.
33 I did not know him; but he who sent
me to baptize in water had told me,
The man on whom you see the Spirit
come down and rest is the one who is to
baptize in Holy Spirit.
34 I have seen it and have borne
witness: this is God's Chosen One.
35 The next day again, John was
standing with two of his disciples
36 when Jesus passed by. John looked
towards him and said, There is the Lamb
of God!John 1.37–45
5
37 When the two disciples heard what
he said, they followed Jesus.
38 He turned and saw them following;
What are you looking for? he asked.
They said, Rabbi, (which means Teacher)
where are you staying?
39 Come and see, he replied. So they
went and saw where he was staying, and
spent the rest of the day with him. It
was about four in the afternoon.
40 One of the two who followed Jesus
after hearing what John said was
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
41 The first thing he did was to find his
brother Simon and say to him, We have
found the Messiah (which is the Hebrew
for Christ).
42 He brought Simon to Jesus, who
looked at him and said, You are Simon
son of John; you shall be called Cephas
(that is, Peter, the Rock).
43 The next day Jesus decided to leave
for Galilee. He met Philip, who, like
Andrew and Peter, came from Bethsaida,
and said to him, Follow me.
44 (1:43)
45 Philip went to find Nathanael and
told him, We have found the man ofJohn 1.46–2.2
6
whom Moses wrote in the law, the man
foretold by the prophets: it is Jesus son
of Joseph, from Nazareth.
46 Nazareth! Nathanael exclaimed. Can
anything good come from Nazareth?
Philip said, Come and see.
47 When Jesus saw Nathanael coming
towards him, he said, Here is an Israelite
worthy of the name; there is nothing
false in him.
48 Nathanael asked him, How is it you
know me? Jesus replied, I saw you under
the fig tree before Philip spoke to you.
49 Rabbi, said Nathanael, you are the
Son of God; you are king of Israel.
50 Jesus answered, Do you believe this
because I told you I saw you under the
fig tree? You will see greater things than
that.
51 Then he added, In very truth I
tell you all: you will see heaven wide
open and God's angels ascending and
descending upon the Son of Man.
1 TWO DAYS later there was a
wedding at Cana-in-Galilee. The
mother of Jesus was there,
2 and Jesus and his disciples were also
among the guests.
2John 2.3–11
7
3 The wine gave out, so Jesus's mother
said to him, They have no wine left.
4 He answered, That is no concern of
mine. My hour has not yet come.
5 His mother said to the servants, Do
whatever he tells you.
6 There were six stone water-jars
standing near, of the kind used for
Jewish rites of purification; each held
from twenty to thirty gallons.
7 Jesus said to the servants, Fill the jars
with water, and they filled them to the
brim.
8 Now draw some off, he ordered, and
take it to the master of the feast; and
they did so.
9 The master tasted the water now
turned into wine, not knowing its source,
though the servants who had drawn the
water knew. He hailed the bridegroom
10 and said, Everyone else serves the
best wine first, and the poorer only when
the guests have drunk freely; but you
have kept the best wine till now.
11 So Jesus performed at Cana-in-
Galilee the first of the signs which
revealed his glory and led his disciples to
believe in him.John 2.12–20
8
12 AFTER this he went down to
Capernaum with his mother, his
brothers, and his disciples, and they
stayed there a few days.
13 As it was near the time of the Jewish
Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
14 In the temple precincts he found the
dealers in cattle, sheep, and pigeons,
and the money-changers seated at their
tables.
15 He made a whip of cords and drove
them out of the temple, sheep, cattle,
and all. He upset the tables of the
money-changers, scattering their coins.
16 Then he turned on the dealers in
pigeons: Take them out of here, he said;
do not turn my Father's house into a
market.
17 His disciples recalled the words
of scripture: Zeal for your house will
consume me.
18 The Jews challenged Jesus: What
sign can you show to justify your action?
19 Destroy this temple, Jesus replied,
and in three days I will raise it up again.
20 The Jews said, It has taken forty-six
years to build this temple. Are you going
to raise it up again in three days?John 2.21–3.4
9
21 But the temple he was speaking of
was his body.
22 After his resurrection his disciples
recalled what he had said, and they
believed the scripture and the words that
Jesus had spoken.
23 WHILE he was in Jerusalem for
Passover many put their trust in him
when they saw the signs that he
performed.
24 But Jesus for his part would not trust
himself to them. He knew them all,
25 and had no need of evidence from
others about anyone, for he himself
could tell what was in people.
1 ONE of the Pharisees, called
Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish
Council,
2 came to Jesus by night. Rabbi, he
said, we know that you are a teacher
sent by God; no one could perform these
signs of yours unless God were with him.
3 Jesus answered, In very truth I tell
you, no one can see the kingdom of God
unless he has been born again.
4 But how can someone be born when
he is old? asked Nicodemus. Can he
3John 3.5–13
10
enter his mother's womb a second time
and be born?
5 Jesus answered, In very truth I tell
you, no one can enter the kingdom of
God without being born from water and
spirit.
6 Flesh can give birth only to flesh; it is
spirit that gives birth to spirit.
7 You ought not to be astonished when I
say, You must all be born again.
8 The wind blows where it wills; you
hear the sound of it, but you do not
know where it comes from or where it is
going. So it is with everyone who is born
from the Spirit.
9 How is this possible? asked Nicodemus.
10 You a teacher of Israel and ignorant
of such things! said Jesus.
11 In very truth I tell you, we speak of
what we know, and testify to what we
have seen, and yet you all reject our
testimony.
12 If you do not believe me when I talk
to you about earthly things, how are
you to believe if I should talk about the
things of heaven?
13 No one has gone up into heaven
except the one who came down fromJohn 3.14–20
11
heaven, the Son of Man who is in
heaven.
14 Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in
the wilderness, so the Son of Man must
be lifted up,
15 in order that everyone who has faith
may in him have eternal life.
16 God so loved the world that he gave
his only Son, that everyone who has
faith in him may not perish but have
eternal life.
17 It was not to judge the world that
God sent his Son into the world, but that
through him the world might be saved.
18 No one who puts his faith in him
comes under judgement; but the
unbeliever has already been judged
because he has not put his trust in God's
only Son.
19 This is the judgement: the light
has come into the world, but people
preferred darkness to light because their
deeds were evil.
20 Wrongdoers hate the light and avoid
it, for fear their misdeeds should be
exposed.John 3.21–29
12
21 Those who live by the truth come to
the light so that it may be clearly seen
that God is in all they do.
22 AFTER this Jesus went with his
disciples into Judaea; he remained there
with them and baptized.
23 John too was baptizing at Aenon,
near Salim, because water was plentiful
in that region; and all the time people
were coming for baptism.
24 This was before John's imprisonment.
25 John's disciples were engaged
in a debate with some Jews about
purification;
26 so they came to John and said, Rabbi,
there was a man with you on the other
side of the Jordan, to whom you bore
your witness. Now he is baptizing, and
everyone is flocking to him.
27 John replied: One can have only what
is given one from Heaven.
28 You yourselves can testify that I said,
I am not the Messiah; I have been sent
as his forerunner.
29 It is the bridegroom who marries
the bride. The bridegroom's friend, who
stands by and listens to him, is overjoyedJohn 3.30–4.1
13
at hearing the bridegroom's voice. This
is my joy and now it is complete.
30 He must grow greater; I must
become less.
31 He who comes from above is above
all others; he who is from the earth
belongs to the earth and uses earthly
speech. He who comes from heaven
32 bears witness to what he has seen
and heard, even though no one accepts
his witness.
33 To accept his witness is to affirm that
God speaks the truth;
34 for he whom God sent utters the
words of God, so measureless is God's
gift of the Spirit.
35 The Father loves the Son and has
entrusted him with complete authority.
36 Whoever puts his faith in the Son has
eternal life. Whoever disobeys the Son
will not see that life; God's wrath rests
upon him.
1 NEWS now reached the Pharisees
that Jesus was winning and baptizing
more disciples than John; although,
in fact, it was his disciples who were
baptizing, not Jesus himself. When Jesus
heard this,
4John 4.2–11
14
2 (4:1)
3 he left Judaea and set out once more
for Galilee.
4 He had to pass through Samaria,
5 and on his way came to a Samaritan
town called Sychar, near the plot of
ground which Jacob gave to his son
Joseph;
6 Jacob's well was there. It was about
noon, and Jesus, tired after his journey,
was sitting by the well.
7 Meanwhile a Samaritan woman came
to draw water, and Jesus said to her,
Give me a drink.
8 His disciples had gone into the town to
buy food.
9 The woman said, What! You, a Jew,
ask for a drink from a Samaritan woman?
(Jews do not share drinking vessels with
Samaritans.)
10 Jesus replied, If only you knew what
God gives, and who it is that is asking
you for a drink, you would have asked
him and he would have given you living
water.
11 Sir, the woman said, you have no
bucket and the well is deep, so where
can you get living water?John 4.12–20
15
12 Are you greater than Jacob our
ancestor who gave us the well and drank
from it himself, he and his sons and his
cattle too?
13 Jesus answered, Everyone who drinks
this water will be thirsty again;
14 but whoever drinks the water I shall
give will never again be thirsty. The
water that I shall give will be a spring
of water within him, welling up and
bringing eternal life.
15 Sir, said the woman, give me this
water, and then I shall not be thirsty, nor
have to come all this way to draw water.
16 Go and call your husband, said Jesus,
and come back here.
17 She answered, I have no husband.
Jesus said, You are right in saying that
you have no husband,
18 for though you have had five
husbands, the man you are living with
now is not your husband. You have
spoken the truth!
19 Sir, replied the woman, I can see you
are a prophet.
20 Our fathers worshipped on this
mountain, but you Jews say that theJohn 4.21–27
16
place where God must be worshipped is
in Jerusalem.
21 Believe me, said Jesus, the time
is coming when you will worship the
Father neither on this mountain nor in
Jerusalem.
22 You Samaritans worship you know
not what; we worship what we know. It
is from the Jews that salvation comes.
23 But the time is coming, indeed it is
already here, when true worshippers will
worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
These are the worshippers the Father
wants.
24 God is spirit, and those who worship
him must worship in spirit and in truth.
25 The woman answered, I know that
Messiah (that is, Christ) is coming. When
he comes he will make everything clear
to us.
26 Jesus said to her, I am he, I who am
speaking to you.
27 At that moment his disciples
returned, and were astonished to find
him talking with a woman; but none of
them said, What do you want? or, Why
are you talking with her?John 4.28–37
17
28 The woman left her water-jar and
went off to the town, where she said to
the people,
29 Come and see a man who has told
me everything I ever did. Could this be
the Messiah?
30 They left the town and made their
way towards him.
31 MEANWHILE the disciples were urging
him, Rabbi, have something to eat.
32 But he said, I have food to eat of
which you know nothing.
33 At this the disciples said to one
another, Can someone have brought him
food?
34 But Jesus said, For me it is meat and
drink to do the will of him who sent me
until I have finished his work.
35 Do you not say, Four months more
and then comes harvest? But look, I tell
you, look around at the fields: they are
already white, ripe for harvesting.
36 The reaper is drawing his pay and
harvesting a crop for eternal life, so that
sower and reaper may rejoice together.
37 That is how the saying comes true:
One sows, another reaps.John 4.38–45
18
38 I sent you to reap a crop for which
you have not laboured. Others laboured
and you have come in for the harvest of
their labour.
39 Many Samaritans of that town came
to believe in him because of the woman's
testimony: He told me everything I ever
did.
40 So when these Samaritans came to
him they pressed him to stay with them;
and he stayed there two days.
41 Many more became believers because
of what they heard from his own lips.
42 They told the woman, It is no longer
because of what you said that we believe,
for we have heard him ourselves; and
we are convinced that he is the Saviour
of the world.
43 WHEN the two days were over Jesus
left for Galilee;
44 for he himself had declared that a
prophet is without honour in his own
country.
45 On his arrival the Galileans made him
welcome, because they had seen all he
did at the festival in Jerusalem; they had
been at the festival themselves.John 4.46–53
19
46 Once again he visited Cana-in-
Galilee, where he had turned the water
into wine. An officer in the royal service
was there, whose son was lying ill at
Capernaum.
47 When he heard that Jesus had come
from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him
and begged him to go down and cure his
son, who was at the point of death.
48 Jesus said to him, Will none of you
ever believe without seeing signs and
portents?
49 The officer pleaded with him, Sir,
come down before my boy dies.
50 Return home, said Jesus; your son
will live. The man believed what Jesus
said and started for home.
51 While he was on his way down his
servants met him with the news that his
child was going to live.
52 So he asked them at what time he
had begun to recover, and they told him,
It was at one o'clock yesterday afternoon
that the fever left him.
53 The father realized that this was the
time at which Jesus had said to him,
Your son will live, and he and all his
household became believers.John 4.54–5.10
20
54 This was the second sign which Jesus
performed after coming from Judaea into
Galilee.
1 SOME time later, Jesus went up
to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish
festivals.
2 Now at the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem
there is a pool whose Hebrew name is
Bethesda. It has five colonnades
3 and in them lay a great number of sick
people, blind, lame, and paralysed.
4 [[EMPTY]]
5 Among them was a man who had been
crippled for thirty-eight years.
6 Jesus saw him lying there, and
knowing that he had been ill a long time
he asked him, Do you want to get well?
7 Sir, he replied, I have no one to put me
in the pool when the water is disturbed;
while I am getting there, someone else
steps into the pool before me.
8 Jesus answered, Stand up, take your
bed and walk.
9 The man recovered instantly; he took
up his bed, and began to walk. That day
was a sabbath.
10 So the Jews said to the man who
had been cured, It is the sabbath. It is
5John 5.11–18
21
against the law for you to carry your
bed.
11 He answered, The man who cured
me, he told me, Take up your bed and
walk.
12 They asked him, Who is this man who
told you to take it up and walk?
13 But the man who had been cured did
not know who it was; for the place was
crowded and Jesus had slipped away.
14 A little later Jesus found him in the
temple and said to him, Now that you
are well, give up your sinful ways, or
something worse may happen to you.
15 The man went off and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had cured him.
16 It was for doing such things on the
sabbath that the Jews began to take
action against Jesus.
17 He defended himself by saying, My
Father continues to work, and I must
work too.
18 This made the Jews all the more
determined to kill him, because not
only was he breaking the sabbath but,
by calling God his own Father, he was
claiming equality with God.John 5.19–25
22
19 To this charge Jesus replied, In very
truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing
by himself; he does only what he sees
the Father doing: whatever the Father
does, the Son does.
20 For the Father loves the Son and
shows him all that he himself is doing,
and will show him even greater deeds,
to fill you with wonder.
21 As the Father raises the dead and
gives them life, so the Son gives life as
he chooses.
22 Again, the Father does not judge
anyone, but has given full jurisdiction to
the Son;
23 it is his will that all should pay the
same honour to the Son as to the Father.
To deny honour to the Son is to deny it
to the Father who sent him.
24 In very truth I tell you, whoever
heeds what I say and puts his trust in
him who sent me has eternal life; he
does not come to judgement, but has
already passed from death to life.
25 In very truth I tell you, the time is
coming, indeed it is already here, when
the dead shall hear the voice of the SonJohn 5.26–34
23
of God, and those who hear shall come
to life.
26 For as the Father has life in himself,
so by his gift the Son also has life in
himself.
27 As Son of Man he has also been given
authority to pass judgement.
28 Do not be surprised at this, because
the time is coming when all who are in
the grave shall hear his voice
29 and come out: those who have done
right will rise to life; those who have
done wrong will rise to judgement.
30 I cannot act by myself; I judge as
I am bidden, and my sentence is just,
because I seek to do not my own will,
but the will of him who sent me.
31 If I testify on my own behalf, that
testimony is not valid.
32 There is another who bears witness
for me, and I know that his testimony
about me is valid.
33 You sent messengers to John, and he
has testified to the truth.
34 Not that I rely on human testimony,
but I remind you of it for your own
salvation.John 5.35–43
24
35 John was a brightly burning lamp,
and for a time you were ready to exult in
his light.
36 But I rely on a testimony higher than
John's: the work my Father has given
me to do and to finish, the very work I
have in hand, testifies that the Father
has sent me.
37 And the Father who has sent me has
borne witness on my behalf. His voice
you have never heard, his form you have
never seen;
38 his word has found no home in you,
because you do not believe the one
whom he sent.
39 You study the scriptures diligently,
supposing that in having them you have
eternal life; their testimony points to me,
40 yet you refuse to come to me to
receive that life.
41 I do not look to men for honour.
42 But I know that with you it is
different, for you have no love of God in
you.
43 I have come accredited by my Father,
and you have no welcome for me; but
let someone self-accredited come, and
you will give him a welcome.John 5.44–6.5
25
44 How can you believe when you accept
honour from one another, and care
nothing for the honour that comes from
him who alone is God?
45 Do not imagine that I shall be your
accuser at the Father's tribunal. Your
accuser is Moses, the very Moses on
whom you have set your hope.
46 If you believed him you would believe
me, for it was of me that he wrote.
47 But if you do not believe what he
wrote, how are you to believe what I
say?
1 SOME time later Jesus withdrew to
the farther shore of the sea of Galilee
(or Tiberias),
2 and a large crowd of people followed
him because they had seen the signs he
performed in healing the sick.
3 Jesus went up the hillside and sat
down with his disciples.
4 It was near the time of Passover, the
great Jewish festival.
5 Looking up and seeing a large crowd
coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip,
Where are we to buy bread to feed these
people?
6John 6.6–14
26
6 He said this to test him; Jesus himself
knew what he meant to do.
7 Philip replied, We would need two
hundred denarii to buy enough bread for
each of them to have a little.
8 One of his disciples, Andrew, the
brother of Simon Peter, said to him,
9 There is a boy here who has five
barley loaves and two fish; but what is
that among so many?
10 Jesus said, Make the people sit down.
There was plenty of grass there, so the
men sat down, about five thousand of
them.
11 Then Jesus took the loaves, gave
thanks, and distributed them to the
people as they sat there. He did the
same with the fish, and they had as
much as they wanted.
12 When everyone had had enough, he
said to his disciples, Gather up the pieces
left over, so that nothing is wasted.
13 They gathered them up, and filled
twelve baskets with the pieces of the five
barley loaves that were left uneaten.
14 When the people saw the sign Jesus
had performed, the word went round,John 6.15–22
27
Surely this must be the Prophet who was
to come into the world.
15 Jesus, realizing that they meant to
come and seize him to proclaim him
king, withdrew again to the hills by
himself.
16 At nightfall his disciples went down to
the sea,
17 and set off by boat to cross to
Capernaum. Though darkness had fallen,
Jesus had not yet joined them;
18 a strong wind was blowing and the
sea grew rough.
19 When they had rowed about three
or four miles they saw Jesus walking on
the sea and approaching the boat. They
were terrified,
20 but he called out, It is I; do not be
afraid.
21 With that they were ready to take
him on board, and immediately the boat
reached the land they were making for.
22 NEXT morning the crowd was still on
the opposite shore. They had seen only
one boat there, and Jesus, they knew,
had not embarked with his disciples, who
had set off by themselves.John 6.23–29
28
23 Boats from Tiberias, however, had
come ashore near the place where the
people had eaten the bread over which
the Lord gave thanks.
24 When the crowd saw that Jesus had
gone as well as his disciples, they went
on board these boats and made for
Capernaum in search of him.
25 They found him on the other side.
Rabbi, they asked, when did you come
here?
26 Jesus replied, In very truth I tell you,
it is not because you saw signs that
you came looking for me, but because
you ate the bread and your hunger was
satisfied.
27 You should work, not for this
perishable food, but for the food that
lasts, the food of eternal life. This food
the Son of Man will give you, for on him
God the Father has set the seal of his
authority.
28 Then what must we do, they asked
him, if our work is to be the work of
God?
29 Jesus replied, This is the work that
God requires: to believe in the one whom
he has sent.John 6.30–38
29
30 They asked, What sign can you give
us, so that we may see it and believe
you? What is the work you are doing?
31 Our ancestors had manna to eat in
the desert; as scripture says, He gave
them bread from heaven to eat.
32 Jesus answered, In very truth I tell
you, it was not Moses who gave you the
bread from heaven; it is my Father who
gives you the true bread from heaven.
33 The bread that God gives comes
down from heaven and brings life to the
world.
34 Sir, they said to him, give us this
bread now and always.
35 Jesus said to them, I am the bread of
life. Whoever comes to me will never be
hungry, and whoever believes in me will
never be thirsty.
36 But you, as I said, have seen and yet
you do not believe.
37 All that the Father gives me will come
to me, and anyone who comes to me I
will never turn away.
38 I have come down from heaven, to
do not my own will, but the will of him
who sent me.John 6.39–47
30
39 It is his will that I should not lose
even one of those he has given me, but
should raise them all up on the last day.
40 For it is my Father's will that everyone
who sees the Son and has faith in him
should have eternal life; and I will raise
them up on the last day.
41 At this the Jews began to grumble
because he said, I am the bread which
came down from heaven.
42 They said, Surely this is Jesus,
Joseph's son! We know his father and
mother. How can he say, I have come
down from heaven?
43 Stop complaining among yourselves,
Jesus told them.
44 No one can come to me unless he is
drawn by the Father who sent me; and I
will raise him up on the last day.
45 It is written in the prophets: They will
all be taught by God. Everyone who has
listened to the Father and learned from
him comes to me.
46 I do not mean that anyone has seen
the Father; he who has come from God
has seen the Father, and he alone.
47 In very truth I tell you, whoever
believes has eternal life.John 6.48–57
31
48 I am the bread of life.
49 Your ancestors ate manna in the
wilderness, yet they are dead.
50 I am speaking of the bread that
comes down from heaven; whoever eats
it will never die.
51 I am the living bread that has come
down from heaven; if anyone eats this
bread, he will live for ever. The bread
which I shall give is my own flesh, given
for the life of the world.
52 This led to a fierce dispute among the
Jews. How can this man give us his flesh
to eat? they protested.
53 Jesus answered them, In very truth I
tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the
Son of Man and drink his blood you can
have no life in you.
54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks
my blood has eternal life, and I will raise
him up on the last day.
55 My flesh is real food; my blood is real
drink.
56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood dwells in me and I in him.
57 As the living Father sent me, and I
live because of the Father, so whoever
eats me will live because of me.John 6.58–66
32
58 This is the bread which came down
from heaven; it is not like the bread
which our fathers ate; they are dead, but
whoever eats this bread will live for ever.
59 JESUS said these things in the
synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.
60 On hearing them, many of his
disciples exclaimed, This is more than
we can stand! How can anyone listen to
such talk?
61 Jesus was aware that his disciples
were grumbling about it and asked them,
Does this shock you?
62 Then what if you see the Son of Man
ascending to where he was before?
63 It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh
can achieve nothing; the words I have
spoken to you are both spirit and life.
64 Yet there are some of you who have
no faith. For Jesus knew from the outset
who were without faith and who was to
betray him.
65 So he said, This is why I told you that
no one can come to me unless it has
been granted to him by the Father.
66 From that moment many of his
disciples drew back and no longer went
about with him.John 6.67–7.4
33
67 So Jesus asked the Twelve, Do you
also want to leave?
68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to
whom shall we go? Your words are words
of eternal life.
69 We believe and know that you are
God's Holy One.
70 Jesus answered, Have I not chosen
the twelve of you? Yet one of you is a
devil.
71 He meant Judas son of Simon
Iscariot. It was he who would betray
him, and he was one of the Twelve.
1 AFTER that Jesus travelled around
within Galilee; he decided to avoid
Judaea because the Jews were looking
for a chance to kill him.
2 But when the Jewish feast of
Tabernacles was close at hand,
3 his brothers said to him, You should
leave here and go into Judaea, so that
your disciples may see the great things
you are doing.
4 No one can hope for recognition if he
works in obscurity. If you can really do
such things as these, show yourself to
the world.
7John 7.5–14
34
5 For even his brothers had no faith in
him.
6 Jesus answered: The right time for me
has not yet come, but any time is right
for you.
7 The world cannot hate you; but it
hates me for exposing the wickedness of
its ways.
8 Go up to the festival yourselves. I am
not going to this festival, because the
right time for me has not yet come.
9 So saying he stayed behind in Galilee.
10 Later, when his brothers had gone to
the festival, he went up too, not openly,
but in secret.
11 At the festival the Jews were looking
for him and asking where he was,
12 and there was much murmuring
about him in the crowds. He is a good
man, said some. No, said others, he is
leading the people astray.
13 No one talked freely about him,
however, for fear of the Jews.
14 WHEN the festival was already half
over, Jesus went up to the temple and
began to teach.John 7.15–23
35
15 The Jews were astonished: How is it,
they said, that this untrained man has
such learning?
16 Jesus replied, My teaching is not my
own but his who sent me.
17 Whoever chooses to do the will of
God will know whether my teaching
comes from him or is merely my own.
18 Anyone whose teaching is merely his
own seeks his own glory; but if anyone
seeks the glory of him who sent him, he
is sincere and there is nothing false in
him.
19 Did not Moses give you the law? Yet
not one of you keeps it. Why are you
trying to kill me?
20 The crowd answered, You are
possessed! Who wants to kill you?
21 Jesus replied, I did one good deed,
and you are all taken aback.
22 But consider: Moses gave you the law
of circumcision (not that it originated
with Moses, but with the patriarchs) and
you circumcise even on the sabbath.
23 Well then, if someone can be
circumcised on the sabbath to avoid
breaking the law of Moses, why are youJohn 7.24–31
36
indignant with me for making someone's
whole body well on the sabbath?
24 Stop judging by appearances; be just
in your judgements.
25 This prompted some of the people of
Jerusalem to say, Is not this the man
they want to put to death?
26 Yet here he is, speaking in public,
and they say not one word to him. Can it
be that our rulers have decided that this
is the Messiah?
27 Yet we know where this man comes
from; when the Messiah appears no one
is to know where he comes from.
28 Jesus responded to this as he taught
in the temple: Certainly you know me,
he declared, and you know where I come
from. Yet I have not come of my own
accord; I was sent by one who is true,
and him you do not know.
29 I know him because I come from
him, and he it is who sent me.
30 At this they tried to seize him, but no
one could lay hands on him because his
appointed hour had not yet come.
31 Among the people many believed
in him. When the Messiah comes, theyJohn 7.32–38
37
said, is it likely that he will perform more
signs than this man?
32 The Pharisees overheard these
mutterings about him among the people,
so the chief priests and the Pharisees
sent temple police to arrest him.
33 Then Jesus said, For a little longer I
shall be with you; then I am going away
to him who sent me.
34 You will look for me, but you will not
find me; and where I am, you cannot
come.
35 So the Jews said to one another,
Where does he intend to go, that we
should not be able to find him? Will he
go to the Dispersion among the Gentiles,
and teach Gentiles?
36 What does he mean by saying, You
will look for me, but you will not find me;
and where I am, you cannot come?
37 ON the last and greatest day of the
festival Jesus stood and declared, If
anyone is thirsty, let him come to me
and drink.
38 Whoever believes in me, as scripture
says, Streams of living water shall flow
from within him.John 7.39–49
38
39 He was speaking of the Spirit which
believers in him would later receive;
for the Spirit had not yet been given,
because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
40 On hearing his words some of the
crowd said, This must certainly be the
Prophet.
41 Others said, This is the Messiah. But
others argued, Surely the Messiah is not
to come from Galilee?
42 Does not scripture say that the
Messiah is to be of the family of David,
from David's village of Bethlehem?
43 Thus he was the cause of a division
among the people.
44 Some were for arresting him, but no
one laid hands on him.
45 The temple police went back to the
chief priests and Pharisees, who asked
them, Why have you not brought him?
46 No one ever spoke as this man
speaks, they replied.
47 The Pharisees retorted, Have you too
been misled?
48 Has a single one of our rulers believed
in him, or any of the Pharisees?
49 As for this rabble, which cares
nothing for the law, a curse is on them.John 7.50–8.6
39
50 Then one of their number, Nicodemus
(the man who once visited Jesus),
intervened.
51 Does our law, he asked them, permit
us to pass judgement on someone
without first giving him a hearing and
learning the facts?
52 Are you a Galilean too? they retorted.
Study the scriptures and you will find
that the Prophet does not come from
Galilee.
53 AND they all went home,
1 while Jesus went to the mount of
Olives.
2 At daybreak he appeared again in
the temple, and all the people gathered
round him. He had taken his seat and
was engaged in teaching them
3 when the scribes and the Pharisees
brought in a woman caught committing
adultery. Making her stand in the middle
4 they said to him, Teacher, this woman
was caught in the very act of adultery.
5 In the law Moses has laid down that
such women are to be stoned. What do
you say about it?
6 They put the question as a test,
hoping to frame a charge against him.
8John 8.7–14
40
Jesus bent down and wrote with his
finger on the ground.
7 When they continued to press their
question he sat up straight and said, Let
whichever of you is free from sin throw
the first stone at her.
8 Then once again he bent down and
wrote on the ground.
9 When they heard what he said, one by
one they went away, the eldest first; and
Jesus was left alone, with the woman
still standing there.
10 Jesus again sat up and said to the
woman, Where are they? Has no one
condemned you?
11 She answered, No one, sir. Neither
do I condemn you, Jesus said. Go; do
not sin again.
12 ONCE again Jesus addressed the
people: I am the light of the world. No
follower of mine shall walk in darkness;
he shall have the light of life.
13 The Pharisees said to him, You
are witness in your own cause; your
testimony is not valid.
14 Jesus replied, My testimony is valid,
even though I do testify on my own
behalf; because I know where I comeJohn 8.15–22
41
from, and where I am going. But you
know neither where I come from nor
where I am going.
15 You judge by worldly standards; I
pass judgement on no one.
16 If I do judge, my judgement is valid
because it is not I alone who judge, but
I and he who sent me.
17 In your own law it is written that the
testimony of two witnesses is valid.
18 I am a witness in my own cause, and
my other witness is the Father who sent
me.
19 Where is your father? they asked
him. Jesus replied, You do not know me
or my Father; if you knew me you would
know my Father too.
20 Jesus was teaching near the treasury
in the temple when he said this; but no
one arrested him, because his hour had
not yet come.
21 Again he said to them, I am going
away. You will look for me, but you will
die in your sin; where I am going, you
cannot come.
22 At this the Jews said, Perhaps he will
kill himself: is that what he means whenJohn 8.23–30
42
he says, Where I am going, you cannot
come?
23 Jesus continued, You belong to this
world below, I to the world above. Your
home is in this world, mine is not.
24 That is why I told you that you would
die in your sins; and you will die in your
sins unless you believe that I am what I
am.
25 And who are you? they asked him.
Jesus answered, What I have told you all
along.
26 I have much to say about you --
and in judgement. But he who sent me
speaks the truth, and what I heard from
him I report to the world.
27 They did not understand that he was
speaking to them about the Father.
28 So Jesus said to them, When you
have lifted up the Son of Man you will
know that I am what I am. I do nothing
on my own authority, but in all I say, I
have been taught by my Father.
29 He who sent me is present with me,
and has not left me on my own; for I
always do what is pleasing to him.
30 As he said this, many put their faith
in him.John 8.31–39
43
31 Turning to the Jews who had believed
him, Jesus said, If you stand by my
teaching, you are truly my disciples;
32 you will know the truth, and the truth
will set you free.
33 We are Abraham's descendants, they
replied; we have never been in slavery
to anyone. What do you mean by saying,
You will become free?
34 In very truth I tell you, said Jesus,
that everyone who commits sin is a
slave.
35 The slave has no permanent standing
in the household, but the son belongs to
it for ever.
36 If then the Son sets you free, you will
indeed be free.
37 I know that you are descended from
Abraham, yet you are bent on killing me
because my teaching makes no headway
with you.
38 I tell what I have seen in my Father's
presence; you do what you have learned
from your father.
39 They retorted, Abraham is our father.
If you were Abraham's children, Jesus
replied, you would do as Abraham did.John 8.40–46
44
40 As it is, you are bent on killing me,
because I have told you the truth, which
I heard from God. That is not how
Abraham acted.
41 You are doing your own father's work.
They said, We are not illegitimate; God
is our father, and God alone.
42 Jesus said to them, If God were your
father, you would love me, for God is
the source of my being, and from him
I come. I have not come of my own
accord; he sent me.
43 Why do you not understand what I
am saying? It is because my teaching is
beyond your grasp.
44 Your father is the devil and you
choose to carry out your father's desires.
He was a murderer from the beginning,
and is not rooted in the truth; there is
no truth in him. When he tells a lie he is
speaking his own language, for he is a
liar and the father of lies.
45 But because I speak the truth, you
do not believe me.
46 Which of you can convict me of sin?
If what I say is true, why do you not
believe me?John 8.47–54
45
47 He who has God for his father listens
to the words of God. You are not God's
children, and that is why you do not
listen.
48 The Jews answered, Are we not right
in saying that you are a Samaritan, and
that you are possessed?
49 I am not possessed, said Jesus; I am
honouring my Father, but you dishonour
me.
50 I do not care about my own glory;
there is one who does care, and he is
judge.
51 In very truth I tell you, if anyone
obeys my teaching he will never see
death.
52 The Jews said, Now we are certain
that you are possessed. Abraham is dead
and so are the prophets; yet you say, If
anyone obeys my teaching he will never
taste death.
53 Are you greater than our father
Abraham? He is dead and the prophets
too are dead. Who do you claim to be?
54 Jesus replied, If I glorify myself,
that glory of mine is worthless. It is the
Father who glorifies me, he of whom you
say, He is our God,John 8.55–9.5
46
55 though you do not know him. But I
know him; if I were to say that I did not
know him I should be a liar like you. I do
know him and I obey his word.
56 Your father Abraham was overjoyed
to see my day; he saw it and was glad.
57 The Jews protested, You are not yet
fifty years old. How can you have seen
Abraham?
58 Jesus said, In very truth I tell you,
before Abraham was born, I am.
59 They took up stones to throw at him,
but he was not to be seen; and he left
the temple.
1 AS HE went on his way Jesus saw a
man who had been blind from birth.
2 His disciples asked him, Rabbi, why
was this man born blind? Who sinned,
this man or his parents?
3 It is not that he or his parents sinned,
Jesus answered; he was born blind so
that God's power might be displayed in
curing him.
4 While daylight lasts we must carry on
the work of him who sent me; night is
coming, when no one can work.
5 While I am in the world I am the light
of the world.
9John 9.6–14
47
6 With these words he spat on the
ground and made a paste with the
spittle; he spread it on the man's eyes,
7 and said to him, Go and wash in the
pool of Siloam. (The name means Sent.)
The man went off and washed, and came
back able to see.
8 His neighbours and those who were
accustomed to see him begging said, Is
not this the man who used to sit and
beg?
9 Some said, Yes, it is. Others said, No,
but it is someone like him. He himself
said, I am the man.
10 They asked him, How were your eyes
opened?
11 He replied, The man called Jesus
made a paste and smeared my eyes
with it, and told me to go to Siloam and
wash. So I went and washed, and found
I could see.
12 Where is he? they asked. I do not
know, he said.
13 The man who had been blind was
brought before the Pharisees.
14 As it was a sabbath day when Jesus
made the paste and opened his eyes,John 9.15–22
48
15 the Pharisees too asked him how he
had gained his sight. The man told them,
He spread a paste on my eyes; then I
washed, and now I can see.
16 Some of the Pharisees said, This man
cannot be from God; he does not keep
the sabbath. Others said, How could
such signs come from a sinful man? So
they took different sides.
17 Then they continued to question him:
What have you to say about him? It was
your eyes he opened. He answered, He
is a prophet.
18 The Jews would not believe that the
man had been blind and had gained
his sight, until they had summoned his
parents
19 and questioned them: Is this your
son? Do you say that he was born blind?
How is it that he can see now?
20 The parents replied, We know that he
is our son, and that he was born blind.
21 But how it is that he can now see, or
who opened his eyes, we do not know.
Ask him; he is of age; let him speak for
himself.
22 His parents gave this answer because
they were afraid of the Jews; for theJohn 9.23–30
49
Jewish authorities had already agreed
that anyone who acknowledged Jesus
as Messiah should be banned from the
synagogue.
23 That is why the parents said, He is of
age; ask him.
24 So for the second time they
summoned the man who had been blind,
and said, Speak the truth before God.
We know that this man is a sinner.
25 Whether or not he is a sinner, I do
not know, the man replied. All I know is
this: I was blind and now I can see.
26 What did he do to you? they asked.
How did he open your eyes?
27 I have told you already, he retorted,
but you took no notice. Why do you want
to hear it again? Do you also want to
become his disciples?
28 Then they became abusive. You are
that man's disciple, they said, but we
are disciples of Moses.
29 We know that God spoke to Moses,
but as for this man, we do not know
where he comes from.
30 The man replied, How extraordinary!
Here is a man who has opened my eyes,John 9.31–40
50
yet you do not know where he comes
from!
31 We know that God does not listen
to sinners; he listens to anyone who is
devout and obeys his will.
32 To open the eyes of a man born blind
-- that is unheard of since time began.
33 If this man was not from God he
could do nothing.
34 Who are you to lecture us? they
retorted. You were born and bred in sin.
Then they turned him out.
35 Hearing that they had turned him
out, Jesus found him and asked, Have
you faith in the Son of Man?
36 The man answered, Tell me who he
is, sir, that I may put my faith in him.
37 You have seen him, said Jesus;
indeed, it is he who is speaking to you.
38 Lord, I believe, he said, and fell on
his knees before him.
39 Jesus said, It is for judgement that I
have come into this world -- to give sight
to the sightless and to make blind those
who see.
40 Some Pharisees who were present
asked, Do you mean that we are blind?John 9.41–10.8
51
41 If you were blind, said Jesus, you
would not be guilty, but because you
claim to see, your guilt remains.
1 IN very truth I tell you, the man
who does not enter the sheepfold
by the door, but climbs in some other
way, is nothing but a thief and a robber.
2 He who enters by the door is the
shepherd in charge of the sheep.
3 The door-keeper admits him, and the
sheep hear his voice; he calls his own
sheep by name, and leads them out.
4 When he has brought them all out,
he goes ahead of them and the sheep
follow, because they know his voice.
5 They will not follow a stranger; they
will run away from him, because they do
not recognize the voice of strangers.
6 This was a parable that Jesus told
them, but they did not understand what
he meant by it.
7 So Jesus spoke again: In very truth I
tell you, I am the door of the sheepfold.
8 The sheep paid no heed to any who
came before me, for they were all
thieves and robbers.
10John 10.9–16
52
9 I am the door; anyone who comes into
the fold through me will be safe. He will
go in and out and find pasture.
10 A thief comes only to steal, kill, and
destroy; I have come that they may have
life, and may have it in all its fullness.
11 I am the good shepherd; the good
shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep.
12 The hired man, when he sees the wolf
coming, abandons the sheep and runs
away, because he is not the shepherd
and the sheep are not his. Then the wolf
harries the flock and scatters the sheep.
13 The man runs away because he is
a hired man and cares nothing for the
sheep.
14 I am the good shepherd; I know my
own and my own know me,
15 as the Father knows me and I know
the Father; and I lay down my life for
the sheep.
16 But there are other sheep of mine,
not belonging to this fold; I must lead
them as well, and they too will listen to
my voice. There will then be one flock,
one shepherd.John 10.17–26
53
17 The Father loves me because I lay
down my life, to receive it back again.
18 No one takes it away from me; I am
laying it down of my own free will. I have
the right to lay it down, and I have the
right to receive it back again; this charge
I have received from my Father.
19 These words once again caused a
division among the Jews.
20 Many of them said, He is possessed,
he is out of his mind. Why listen to him?
21 Others said, No one possessed by
a demon could speak like this. Could a
demon open the eyes of the blind?
22 IT was winter, and the festival of the
Dedication was being held in Jerusalem.
23 As Jesus was walking in the temple
precincts, in Solomon's Portico,
24 the Jews gathered round him and
asked: How long are you going to keep
us in suspense? Tell us plainly: are you
the Messiah?
25 I have told you, said Jesus, and you
do not believe. My deeds done in my
Father's name are my credentials,
26 but because you are not sheep of my
flock you do not believe.John 10.27–36
54
27 My own sheep listen to my voice; I
know them and they follow me.
28 I give them eternal life and they will
never perish; no one will snatch them
from my care.
29 My Father who has given them to
me is greater than all, and no one can
snatch them out of the Father's care.
30 The Father and I are one.
31 Once again the Jews picked up stones
to stone him.
32 At this Jesus said to them, By the
Father's power I have done many good
deeds before your eyes; for which of
these are you stoning me?
33 We are not stoning you for any
good deed, the Jews replied, but for
blasphemy: you, a man, are claiming to
be God.
34 Jesus answered, Is it not written in
your law, I said: You are gods?
35 It is those to whom God's word came
who are called gods -- and scripture
cannot be set aside.
36 Then why do you charge me with
blasphemy for saying, I am God's son, I
whom the Father consecrated and sent
into the world?John 10.37–11.3
55
37 If my deeds are not the deeds of my
Father, do not believe me.
38 But if they are, then even if you do
not believe me, believe the deeds, so
that you may recognize and know that
the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
39 This provoked them to make another
attempt to seize him, but he escaped
from their clutches.
40 JESUS withdrew again across the
Jordan, to the place where John had
been baptizing earlier, and stayed there
41 while crowds came to him. John gave
us no miraculous sign, they said, but all
that he told us about this man was true.
42 And many came to believe in him
there.
1 There was a man named Lazarus
who had fallen ill. His home was
at Bethany, the village of Mary and her
sister Martha.
2 This Mary, whose brother Lazarus had
fallen ill, was the woman who anointed
the Lord with ointment and wiped his
feet with her hair.
3 The sisters sent a message to him: Sir,
you should know that your friend lies ill.
11John 11.4–13
56
4 When Jesus heard this he said, This
illness is not to end in death; through
it God's glory is to be revealed and the
Son of God glorified.
5 Therefore, though he loved Martha
and her sister and Lazarus,
6 he stayed where he was for two days
after hearing of Lazarus's illness.
7 He then said to his disciples, Let us go
back to Judaea.
8 Rabbi, his disciples said, it is not long
since the Jews there were wanting to
stone you. Are you going there again?
9 Jesus replied, Are there not twelve
hours of daylight? Anyone can walk in
the daytime without stumbling, because
he has this world's light to see by.
10 But if he walks after nightfall he
stumbles, because the light fails him.
11 After saying this he added, Our friend
Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I shall go
and wake him.
12 The disciples said, Master, if he is
sleeping he will recover.
13 Jesus had been speaking of Lazarus's
death, but they thought that he meant
natural sleep.John 11.14–23
57
14 Then Jesus told them plainly: Lazarus
is dead.
15 I am glad for your sake that I was
not there; for it will lead you to believe.
But let us go to him.
16 Thomas, called the Twin, said to his
fellow-disciples, Let us also go and die
with him.
17 ON his arrival Jesus found that
Lazarus had already been four days in
the tomb.
18 Bethany was just under two miles
from Jerusalem,
19 and many of the Jews had come from
the city to visit Martha and Mary and
condole with them about their brother.
20 As soon as Martha heard that Jesus
was on his way, she went to meet him,
and left Mary sitting at home.
21 Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had
been here my brother would not have
died.
22 Even now I know that God will grant
you whatever you ask of him.
23 Jesus said, Your brother will rise
again.John 11.24–32
58
24 I know that he will rise again, said
Martha, at the resurrection on the last
day.
25 Jesus said, I am the resurrection and
the life. Whoever has faith in me shall
live, even though he dies;
26 and no one who lives and has faith in
me shall ever die. Do you believe this?
27 I do, Lord, she answered; I believe
that you are the Messiah, the Son of God
who was to come into the world.
28 So saying she went to call her sister
Mary and, taking her aside, she said,
The Master is here and is asking for you.
29 As soon as Mary heard this she rose
and went to him.
30 Jesus had not yet entered the village,
but was still at the place where Martha
had met him.
31 When the Jews who were in the house
condoling with Mary saw her hurry out,
they went after her, assuming that she
was going to the tomb to weep there.
32 Mary came to the place where Jesus
was, and as soon as she saw him she
fell at his feet and said, Lord, if you had
been here my brother would not have
died.John 11.33–42
59
33 When Jesus saw her weeping and the
Jews who had come with her weeping,
he was moved with indignation and
deeply distressed.
34 Where have you laid him? he asked.
They replied, Come and see.
35 Jesus wept.
36 The Jews said, How dearly he must
have loved him!
37 But some of them said, Could not this
man, who opened the blind man's eyes,
have done something to keep Lazarus
from dying?
38 Jesus, again deeply moved, went to
the tomb. It was a cave, with a stone
placed against it.
39 Jesus said, Take away the stone.
Martha, the dead man's sister, said to
him, Sir, by now there will be a stench;
he has been there four days.
40 Jesus said, Did I not tell you that if
you have faith you will see the glory of
God?
41 Then they removed the stone. Jesus
looked upwards and said, Father, I thank
you for hearing me.
42 I know that you always hear me, but
I have spoken for the sake of the peopleJohn 11.43–50
60
standing round, that they may believe it
was you who sent me.
43 Then he raised his voice in a great
cry: Lazarus, come out.
44 The dead man came out, his hands
and feet bound with linen bandages,
his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said,
Loose him; let him go.
45 MANY of the Jews who had come to
visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did,
put their faith in him.
46 But some of them went off to the
Pharisees and reported what he had
done.
47 Thereupon the chief priests and the
Pharisees convened a meeting of the
Council. This man is performing many
signs, they said, and what action are we
taking?
48 If we let him go on like this the whole
populace will believe in him, and then
the Romans will come and sweep away
our temple and our nation.
49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was
high priest that year, said, You have no
grasp of the situation at all;
50 you do not realize that it is more to
your interest that one man should die forJohn 11.51–57
61
the people, than that the whole nation
should be destroyed.
51 He did not say this of his own accord,
but as the high priest that year he was
prophesying that Jesus would die for the
nation,
52 and not for the nation alone but to
gather together the scattered children of
God.
53 So from that day on they plotted his
death.
54 Accordingly Jesus no longer went
about openly among the Jews, but
withdrew to a town called Ephraim, in
the country bordering on the desert, and
stayed there with his disciples.
55 THE Jewish Passover was now at
hand, and many people went up from
the country to Jerusalem to purify
themselves before the festival.
56 They looked out for Jesus, and as
they stood in the temple they asked one
another, What do you think? Perhaps he
is not coming to the festival.
57 Now the chief priests and the
Pharisees had given orders that anyone
who knew where he was must report it,
so that they might arrest him.John 12.1–9
62
1 SIX days before the Passover
12 festival Jesus came to Bethany,
the home of Lazarus whom he had raised
from the dead.
2 They gave a supper in his honour, at
which Martha served, and Lazarus was
among the guests with Jesus.
3 Then Mary brought a pound of very
costly perfume, pure oil of nard, and
anointed Jesus's feet and wiped them
with her hair, till the house was filled
with the fragrance.
4 At this, Judas Iscariot, one of his
disciples -- the one who was to betray
him -- protested,
5 Could not this perfume have been sold
for three hundred denarii and the money
given to the poor?
6 He said this, not out of any concern
for the poor, but because he was a thief;
he had charge of the common purse and
used to pilfer the money kept in it.
7 Leave her alone, said Jesus. Let her
keep it for the day of my burial.
8 The poor you have always among you,
but you will not always have me.
9 Learning he was there the Jews came
in large numbers, not only because ofJohn 12.10–16
63
Jesus but also to see Lazarus whom he
had raised from the dead.
10 The chief priests then resolved to do
away with Lazarus as well,
11 since on his account many Jews were
going over to Jesus and putting their
faith in him.
12 THE next day the great crowd of
pilgrims who had come for the festival,
hearing that Jesus was on the way to
Jerusalem,
13 went out to meet him with palm
branches in their hands, shouting,
Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king
of Israel!
14 Jesus found a donkey and mounted
it, in accordance with the words of
scripture:
15 Fear no more, daughter of Zion;
see, your king is coming, mounted on a
donkey's colt.
16 At the time his disciples did not
understand this, but after Jesus had
been glorified they remembered that this
had been written about him, and that it
had happened to him.John 12.17–26
64
17 The people who were present when
he called Lazarus out of the tomb and
raised him from the dead kept telling
what they had seen and heard.
18 That is why the crowd went to meet
him: they had heard of this sign that he
had performed.
19 The Pharisees said to one another,
You can see we are getting nowhere; all
the world has gone after him!
20 AMONG those who went up to worship
at the festival were some Gentiles.
21 They approached Philip, who was
from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to
him, Sir, we should like to see Jesus.
22 Philip went and told Andrew, and the
two of them went to tell Jesus.
23 Jesus replied: The hour has come for
the Son of Man to be glorified.
24 In very truth I tell you, unless a grain
of wheat falls into the ground and dies,
it remains that and nothing more; but if
it dies, it bears a rich harvest.
25 Whoever loves himself is lost, but he
who hates himself in this world will be
kept safe for eternal life.
26 If anyone is to serve me, he must
follow me; where I am, there will myJohn 12.27–35
65
servant be. Whoever serves me will be
honoured by the Father.
27 Now my soul is in turmoil, and what
am I to say? Father, save me from this
hour? No, it was for this that I came to
this hour.
28 Father, glorify your name. A voice
came from heaven: I have glorified it,
and I will glorify it again.
29 The crowd standing by said it was
thunder they heard, while others said,
An angel has spoken to him.
30 Jesus replied, This voice spoke for
your sake, not mine.
31 Now is the hour of judgement for this
world; now shall the prince of this world
be driven out.
32 And when I am lifted up from the
earth I shall draw everyone to myself.
33 This he said to indicate the kind of
death he was to die.
34 The people answered, Our law
teaches us that the Messiah remains for
ever. What do you mean by saying that
the Son of Man must be lifted up? What
Son of Man is this?
35 Jesus answered them: The light is
among you still, but not for long. Go onJohn 12.36–42
66
your way while you have the light, so
that darkness may not overtake you. He
who journeys in the dark does not know
where he is going.
36 Trust to the light while you have it, so
that you may become children of light.
After these words Jesus went away from
them into hiding.'
37 IN spite of the many signs which
Jesus had performed in their presence
they would not believe in him,
38 for the prophet Isaiah's words had
to be fulfilled: Lord, who has believed
what we reported, and to whom has the
power of the Lord been revealed?
39 And there is another saying of Isaiah
which explains why they could not
believe:
40 He has blinded their eyes and dulled
their minds, lest they should see with
their eyes, and perceive with their
minds, and turn to me to heal them.
41 Isaiah said this because he saw his
glory and spoke about him.
42 For all that, even among those in
authority many believed in him, but
would not acknowledge him on accountJohn 12.43–50
67
of the Pharisees, for fear of being banned
from the synagogue.
43 For they valued human reputation
rather than the honour which comes
from God.
44 JESUS proclaimed: To believe in me,
is not to believe in me but in him who
sent me;
45 to see me, is to see him who sent
me.
46 I have come into the world as light,
so that no one who has faith in me
should remain in darkness.
47 But if anyone hears my words and
disregards them, I am not his judge; I
have not come to judge the world, but to
save the world.
48 There is a judge for anyone who
rejects me and does not accept my
words; the word I have spoken will be
his judge on the last day.
49 I do not speak on my own authority,
but the Father who sent me has himself
commanded me what to say and how to
speak.
50 I know that his commands are eternal
life. What the Father has said to me,
therefore -- that is what I speak.John 13.1–8
68
1 IT was before the Passover
13 festival, and Jesus knew that his
hour had come and that he must leave
this world and go to the Father. He had
always loved his own who were in the
world, and he loved them to the end.
2 The devil had already put it into the
mind of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to
betray him. During supper,
3 Jesus, well aware that the Father had
entrusted everything to him, and that he
had come from God and was going back
to God,
4 rose from the supper table, took off
his outer garment and, taking a towel,
tied it round him.
5 Then he poured water into a basin,
and began to wash his disciples' feet and
to wipe them with the towel.
6 When he came to Simon Peter, Peter
said to him, You, Lord, washing my feet?
7 Jesus replied, You do not understand
now what I am doing, but one day you
will.
8 Peter said, I will never let you wash
my feet. If I do not wash you, Jesus
replied, you have no part with me.John 13.9–18
69
9 Then, Lord, said Simon Peter, not my
feet only; wash my hands and head as
well!
10 Jesus said to him, Anyone who has
bathed needs no further washing; he is
clean all over; and you are clean, though
not every one of you.
11 He added the words not every one of
you because he knew who was going to
betray him.
12 After washing their feet he put on his
garment and sat down again. Do you
understand what I have done for you?
he asked.
13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and
rightly so, for that is what I am.
14 Then if I, your Lord and Teacher,
have washed your feet, you also ought
to wash one another's feet.
15 I have set you an example: you are
to do as I have done for you.
16 In very truth I tell you, a servant
is not greater than his master, nor a
messenger than the one who sent him.
17 If you know this, happy are you if
you act upon it.
18 I am not speaking about all of you; I
know whom I have chosen. But there isJohn 13.19–26
70
a text of scripture to be fulfilled: He who
eats bread with me has turned against
me.
19 I tell you this now, before the event,
so that when it happens you may believe
that I am what I am.
20 In very truth I tell you, whoever
receives any messenger of mine receives
me; and receiving me, he receives the
One who sent me.
21 After saying this, Jesus exclaimed in
deep distress, In very truth I tell you,
one of you is going to betray me.
22 The disciples looked at one another
in bewilderment: which of them could he
mean?
23 One of them, the disciple he loved,
was reclining close beside Jesus.
24 Simon Peter signalled to him to find
out which one he meant.
25 That disciple leaned back close to
Jesus and asked, Lord, who is it?
26 Jesus replied, It is the one to whom
I give this piece of bread when I have
dipped it in the dish. Then he took it,
dipped it in the dish, and gave it to Judas
son of Simon Iscariot.John 13.27–35
71
27 As soon as Judas had received it
Satan entered him. Jesus said to him,
Do quickly what you have to do.
28 No one at the table understood what
he meant by this.
29 Some supposed that, as Judas was in
charge of the common purse, Jesus was
telling him to buy what was needed for
the festival, or to make some gift to the
poor.
30 As soon as Judas had received the
bread he went out. It was night.
31 WHEN he had gone out, Jesus said,
Now the Son of Man is glorified, and in
him God is glorified.
32 If God is glorified in him, God will
also glorify him in himself; and he will
glorify him now.
33 My children, I am to be with you for
a little longer; then you will look for me,
and, as I told the Jews, I tell you now:
where I am going you cannot come.
34 I give you a new commandment: love
one another; as I have loved you, so you
are to love one another.
35 If there is this love among you, then
everyone will know that you are my
disciples.John 13.36–14.6
72
36 Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where
are you going? Jesus replied, I am going
where you cannot follow me now, but
one day you will.
37 Peter said, Lord, why cannot I follow
you now? I will lay down my life for you.
38 Jesus answered, Will you really lay
down your life for me? In very truth I tell
you, before the cock crows you will have
denied me three times.
1 Set your troubled hearts at rest.
Trust in God always; trust also in
me.
2 There are many dwelling-places in my
Father's house; if it were not so I should
have told you; for I am going to prepare
a place for you.
3 And if I go and prepare a place for
you, I shall come again and take you to
myself, so that where I am you may be
also;
4 and you know the way I am taking.
5 Thomas said, Lord, we do not know
where you are going, so how can we
know the way?
6 Jesus replied, I am the way, the truth,
and the life; no one comes to the Father
except by me.
14John 14.7–14
73
7 If you knew me you would know my
Father too. From now on you do know
him; you have seen him.
8 Philip said to him, Lord, show us the
Father; we ask no more.
9 Jesus answered, Have I been all this
time with you, Philip, and still you do not
know me? Anyone who has seen me has
seen the Father. Then how can you say,
Show us the Father?
10 Do you not believe that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me? I am not
myself the source of the words I speak
to you: it is the Father who dwells in me
doing his own work.
11 Believe me when I say that I am
in the Father and the Father in me; or
else accept the evidence of the deeds
themselves.
12 In very truth I tell you, whoever has
faith in me will do what I am doing;
indeed he will do greater things still
because I am going to the Father.
13 Anything you ask in my name I will
do, so that the Father may be glorified in
the Son.
14 If you ask anything in my name I will
do it.John 14.15–22
74
15 If you love me you will obey my
commands;
16 and I will ask the Father, and he will
give you another to be your advocate,
who will be with you for ever --
17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot
accept him, because the world neither
sees nor knows him; but you know him,
because he dwells with you and will be
in you.
18 I will not leave you bereft; I am
coming back to you.
19 In a little while the world will see me
no longer, but you will see me; because
I live, you too will live.
20 When that day comes you will know
that I am in my Father, and you in me
and I in you.
21 Anyone who has received my
commands and obeys them -- he it is
who loves me; and he who loves me will
be loved by my Father; and I will love
him and disclose myself to him.
22 Judas said -- the other Judas, not
Iscariot -- Lord, how has it come about
that you mean to disclose yourself to us
and not to the world?John 14.23–29
75
23 Jesus replied, Anyone who loves me
will heed what I say; then my Father will
love him, and we will come to him and
make our dwelling with him;
24 but whoever does not love me does
not heed what I say. And the word you
hear is not my own: it is the word of the
Father who sent me.
25 I have told you these things while I
am still with you;
26 but the advocate, the Holy Spirit
whom the Father will send in my name,
will teach you everything and remind
you of all that I have told you.
27 Peace is my parting gift to you, my
own peace, such as the world cannot
give. Set your troubled hearts at rest,
and banish your fears.
28 You heard me say, I am going away,
and I am coming back to you. If you
loved me you would be glad that I am
going to the Father; for the Father is
greater than I am.
29 I have told you now, before it
happens, so that when it does happen
you may have faith.John 14.30–15.6
76
30 I shall not talk much longer with you,
for the prince of this world approaches.
He has no rights over me;
31 but the world must be shown that I
love the Father and am doing what he
commands; come, let us go!
1 I AM the true vine, and my
Father is the gardener.
2 Any branch of mine that is barren he
cuts away; and any fruiting branch he
prunes clean, to make it more fruitful
still.
3 You are already clean because of the
word I have spoken to you.
4 Dwell in me, as I in you. No branch
can bear fruit by itself, but only if it
remains united with the vine; no more
can you bear fruit, unless you remain
united with me.
5 I am the vine; you are the branches.
Anyone who dwells in me, as I dwell in
him, bears much fruit; apart from me
you can do nothing.
6 Anyone who does not dwell in me is
thrown away like a withered branch.
The withered branches are gathered up,
thrown on the fire, and burnt.
15John 15.7–16
77
7 If you dwell in me, and my words
dwell in you, ask whatever you want,
and you shall have it.
8 This is how my Father is glorified: you
are to bear fruit in plenty and so be my
disciples.
9 As the Father has loved me, so I have
loved you. Dwell in my love.
10 If you heed my commands, you will
dwell in my love, as I have heeded my
Father's commands and dwell in his love.
11 I have spoken thus to you, so that
my joy may be in you, and your joy
complete.
12 This is my commandment: love one
another, as I have loved you.
13 There is no greater love than this,
that someone should lay down his life for
his friends.
14 You are my friends, if you do what I
command you.
15 No longer do I call you servants, for a
servant does not know what his master is
about. I have called you friends, because
I have disclosed to you everything that I
heard from my Father.
16 You did not choose me: I chose you.
I appointed you to go on and bear fruit,John 15.17–24
78
fruit that will last; so that the Father may
give you whatever you ask in my name.
17 This is my commandment to you:
love one another.
18 If the world hates you, it hated me
first, as you know well.
19 If you belonged to the world, the
world would love its own; but you do
not belong to the world, now that I have
chosen you out of the world, and for that
reason the world hates you.
20 Remember what I said: A servant
is not greater than his master. If they
persecuted me, they will also persecute
you; if they have followed my teaching,
they will follow yours.
21 All this will they do to you on my
account, because they do not know the
One who sent me.
22 If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would not be guilty of sin;
but now they have no excuse for their
sin:
23 whoever hates me, hates my Father
also.
24 If I had not done such deeds among
them as no one else has ever done, they
would not be guilty of sin; but now theyJohn 15.25–16.5
79
have seen and hated both me and my
Father.
25 This text in their law had to come
true: They hated me without reason.
26 When the advocate has come, whom
I shall send you from the Father -- the
Spirit of truth that issues from the Father
-- he will bear witness to me.
27 And you also are my witnesses,
because you have been with me from
the first.
1 I have told you all this to guard
you against the breakdown of
your faith.
2 They will ban you from the synagogue;
indeed, the time is coming when anyone
who kills you will suppose that he is
serving God.
3 They will do these things because they
did not know either the Father or me.
4 I have told you all this so that when
the time comes for it to happen you may
remember my warning. I did not tell you
this at first, because then I was with
you;
5 but now I am going away to him who
sent me. None of you asks me, Where
are you going?
16John 16.6–14
80
6 Yet you are plunged into grief at what
I have told you.
7 Nevertheless I assure you that it is in
your interest that I am leaving you. If I
do not go, the advocate will not come,
whereas if I go, I will send him to you.
8 When he comes, he will prove the
world wrong about sin, justice, and
judgement:
9 about sin, because they refuse to
believe in me;
10 about justice, because I go to the
Father when I pass from your sight;
11 about judgement, because the prince
of this world stands condemned.
12 There is much more that I could say
to you, but the burden would be too
great for you now.
13 However, when the Spirit of truth
comes, he will guide you into all the
truth; for he will not speak on his own
authority, but will speak only what he
hears; and he will make known to you
what is to come.
14 He will glorify me, for he will take
what is mine and make it known to you.John 16.15–21
81
15 All that the Father has is mine, and
that is why I said, He will take what is
mine and make it known to you.
16 A LITTLE while, and you see me no
more; again a little while, and you will
see me.
17 Some of his disciples said to one
another, What does he mean by this: A
little while, and you will not see me, and
again a little while, and you will see me,
and by this: Because I am going to the
Father?
18 So they asked, What is this little
while that he is talking about? We do not
know what he means.
19 Jesus knew that they were wanting
to question him, and said, Are you
discussing that saying of mine: A little
while, and you will not see me, and again
a little while, and you will see me?
20 In very truth I tell you, you will weep
and mourn, but the world will be glad.
But though you will be plunged in grief,
your grief will be turned to joy.
21 A woman in labour is in pain because
her time has come; but when her baby
is born she forgets the anguish in her joy
that a child has been born into the world.John 16.22–29
82
22 So it is with you: for the moment you
are sad; but I shall see you again, and
then you will be joyful, and no one shall
rob you of your joy.
23 When that day comes you will ask me
nothing more. In very truth I tell you, if
you ask the Father for anything in my
name, he will give it you.
24 So far you have asked nothing in my
name. Ask and you will receive, that
your joy may be complete.
25 Till now I have been using figures of
speech; a time is coming when I shall
no longer use figures, but tell you of the
Father in plain words.
26 When that day comes you will make
your request in my name, and I do not
say that I shall pray to the Father for
you,
27 for the Father loves you himself,
because you have loved me and believed
that I came from God.
28 I came from the Father and have
come into the world; and now I am
leaving the world again and going to the
Father.
29 His disciples said, Now you are
speaking plainly, not in figures of speech!John 16.30–17.4
83
30 We are certain now that you know
everything, and do not need to be asked;
because of this we believe that you have
come from God.
31 Jesus answered, Do you now believe?
32 I warn you, the hour is coming, has
indeed already come, when you are to
be scattered, each to his own home,
leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone, for
the Father is with me.
33 I have told you all this so that in me
you may find peace. In the world you will
have suffering. But take heart! I have
conquered the world.
1 THEN Jesus looked up to heaven
and said: Father, the hour has
come. Glorify your Son, that the Son
may glorify you.
2 For you have made him sovereign
over all mankind, to give eternal life to
all whom you have given him.
3 This is eternal life: to know you the
only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
you have sent.
4 I have glorified you on earth by
finishing the work which you gave me to
do;
17John 17.5–11
84
5 and now, Father, glorify me in your
own presence with the glory which I had
with you before the world began.
6 I have made your name known to
the men whom you gave me out of the
world. They were yours and you gave
them to me, and they have obeyed your
command.
7 Now they know that all you gave me
has come from you;
8 for I have taught them what I learned
from you, and they have received it:
they know with certainty that I came
from you, and they have believed that
you sent me.
9 I pray for them; I am not praying for
the world but for those whom you have
given me, because they belong to you.
10 All that is mine is yours, and what is
yours is mine; and through them is my
glory revealed.
11 I am no longer in the world; they
are still in the world, but I am coming
to you. Holy Father, protect them by the
power of your name, the name you have
given me, that they may be one, as we
are one.John 17.12–20
85
12 While I was with them, I protected
them by the power of your name which
you gave me, and kept them safe. Not
one of them is lost except the man
doomed to be lost, for scripture has to
be fulfilled.
13 Now I am coming to you; but while I
am still in the world I speak these words,
so that they may have my joy within
them in full measure.
14 I have delivered your word to them,
and the world hates them because they
are strangers in the world, as I am.
15 I do not pray you to take them out
of the world, but to keep them from the
evil one.
16 They are strangers in the world, as I
am.
17 Consecrate them by the truth; your
word is truth.
18 As you sent me into the world, I have
sent them into the world,
19 and for their sake I consecrate myself,
that they too may be consecrated by the
truth.
20 It is not for these alone that I pray,
but for those also who through their
words put their faith in me.John 17.21–18.1
86
21 May they all be one; as you, Father,
are in me, and I in you, so also may they
be in us, that the world may believe that
you sent me.
22 The glory which you gave me I have
given to them, that they may be one, as
we are one;
23 I in them and you in me, may they be
perfectly one. Then the world will know
that you sent me, and that you loved
them as you loved me.
24 Father, they are your gift to me;
and my desire is that they may be with
me where I am, so that they may look
upon my glory, which you have given me
because you loved me before the world
began.
25 Righteous Father, although the world
does not know you, I know you, and
they know that you sent me.
26 I made your name known to them,
and will make it known, so that the love
you had for me may be in them, and I in
them.
1 AFTER this prayer, Jesus went
out with his disciples across the
Kedron ravine. There was a garden
18John 18.2–10
87
there, and he and his disciples went into
it.
2 The place was known to Judas, his
betrayer, because Jesus had often met
there with his disciples.
3 So Judas made his way there with a
detachment of soldiers, and with temple
police provided by the chief priests and
the Pharisees; they were equipped with
lanterns, torches, and weapons.
4 Jesus, knowing everything that was
to happen to him, stepped forward and
asked them, Who is it you want?
5 Jesus of Nazareth, they answered.
Jesus said, I am he. And Judas the traitor
was standing there with them.
6 When Jesus said, I am he, they drew
back and fell to the ground.
7 Again he asked, Who is it you want?
Jesus of Nazareth, they repeated.
8 I have told you that I am he, Jesus
answered. If I am the man you want, let
these others go.
9 (This was to make good his words, I
have not lost one of those you gave me.)
10 Thereupon Simon Peter drew the
sword he was wearing and struck at theJohn 18.11–18
88
high priest's servant, cutting off his right
ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
11 Jesus said to Peter, Put away your
sword. This is the cup the Father has
given me; shall I not drink it?
12 THE troops with their commander,
and the Jewish police, now arrested
Jesus and secured him.
13 They took him first to Annas,
father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest
for that year --
14 the same Caiaphas who had advised
the Jews that it would be to their interest
if one man died for the people.
15 Jesus was followed by Simon Peter
and another disciple. This disciple, who
was known to the high priest, went with
Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,
16 but Peter stayed outside at the door.
So the other disciple, the high priest's
acquaintance, went back and spoke to
the girl on duty at the door, and brought
Peter in.
17 The girl said to Peter, Are you another
of this man's disciples? I am not, he said.
18 As it was cold, the servants and
the police had made a charcoal fire,
and were standing round it warmingJohn 18.19–26
89
themselves. Peter too was standing with
them, sharing the warmth.
19 The high priest questioned Jesus
about his disciples and about his
teaching.
20 Jesus replied, I have spoken openly
for all the world to hear; I have always
taught in synagogues or in the temple,
where all Jews congregate; I have said
nothing in secret.
21 Why are you questioning me?
Question those who heard me; they
know what I said.
22 When he said this, one of the police
standing near him struck him on the
face. Is that the way to answer the high
priest? he demanded.
23 Jesus replied, If I was wrong to speak
what I did, produce evidence to prove it;
if I was right, why strike me?
24 So Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas
the high priest.
25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter stood
warming himself, he was asked, Are you
another of his disciples? But he denied
it: I am not, he said.
26 One of the high priest's servants, a
relation of the man whose ear Peter hadJohn 18.27–33
90
cut off, insisted, Did I not see you with
him in the garden?
27 Once again Peter denied it; and at
that moment a cock crowed.
28 FROM Caiaphas Jesus was led into
the governor's headquarters. It was now
early morning, and the Jews themselves
stayed outside the headquarters to avoid
defilement, so that they could eat the
Passover meal.
29 So Pilate came out to them and
asked, What charge do you bring against
this man?
30 If he were not a criminal, they
replied, we would not have brought him
before you.
31 Pilate said, Take him yourselves and
try him by your own law. The Jews
answered, We are not allowed to put
anyone to death.
32 Thus they ensured the fulfilment of
the words by which Jesus had indicated
the kind of death he was to die.
33 Pilate then went back into his
headquarters and summoned Jesus. So
you are the king of the Jews? he said.John 18.34–39
91
34 Jesus replied, Is that your own
question, or have others suggested it to
you?
35 Am I a Jew? said Pilate. Your own
nation and their chief priests have
brought you before me. What have you
done?
36 Jesus replied, My kingdom does
not belong to this world. If it did, my
followers would be fighting to save
me from the clutches of the Jews. My
kingdom belongs elsewhere.
37 You are a king, then? said Pilate.
Jesus answered, King is your word. My
task is to bear witness to the truth. For
this I was born; for this I came into the
world, and all who are not deaf to truth
listen to my voice.
38 Pilate said, What is truth? With those
words he went out again to the Jews and
said, For my part I find no case against
him.
39 But you have a custom that I release
one prisoner for you at Passover. Would
you like me to release the king of the
Jews?John 18.40–19.7
92
40 At this they shouted back: Not him;
we want Barabbas! Barabbas was a
bandit.
1 Pilate now took Jesus and had
him flogged;
2 and the soldiers plaited a crown of
thorns and placed it on his head, and
robed him in a purple cloak.
3 Then one after another they came up
to him, crying, Hail, king of the Jews!
and struck him on the face.
4 Once more Pilate came out and said to
the Jews, Here he is; I am bringing him
out to let you know that I find no case
against him;
5 and Jesus came out, wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple cloak.
Here is the man, said Pilate.
6 At the sight of him the chief priests
and the temple police shouted, Crucify!
Crucify! Take him yourselves and crucify
him, said Pilate; for my part I find no
case against him.
7 The Jews answered, We have a law;
and according to that law he ought to
die, because he has claimed to be God's
Son.
19John 19.8–14
93
8 When Pilate heard that, he was more
afraid than ever,
9 and going back into his headquarters
he asked Jesus, Where have you come
from? But Jesus gave him no answer.
10 Do you refuse to speak to me? said
Pilate. Surely you know that I have
authority to release you, and authority
to crucify you?
11 You would have no authority at all
over me, Jesus replied, if it had not been
granted you from above; and therefore
the deeper guilt lies with the one who
handed me over to you.
12 From that moment Pilate tried hard to
release him; but the Jews kept shouting,
If you let this man go, you are no friend
to Caesar; anyone who claims to be a
king is opposing Caesar.
13 When Pilate heard what they were
saying, he brought Jesus out and took
his seat on the tribunal at the place
known as The Pavement (in Hebrew,
Gabbatha).
14 It was the day of preparation for the
Passover, about noon. Pilate said to the
Jews, Here is your king.John 19.15–23
94
15 They shouted, Away with him! Away
with him! Crucify him! Am I to crucify
your king? said Pilate. We have no king
but Caesar, replied the chief priests.
16 Then at last, to satisfy them, he
handed Jesus over to be crucified. JESUS
was taken away,
17 and went out, carrying the cross
himself, to the place called The Skull (in
Hebrew, Golgotha);
18 there they crucified him, and with
him two others, one on either side, with
Jesus in between.
19 Pilate had an inscription written and
fastened to the cross; it read, Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews.
20 This inscription, in Hebrew, Latin, and
Greek, was read by many Jews, since
the place where Jesus was crucified was
not far from the city.
21 So the Jewish chief priests said to
Pilate, You should not write King of the
Jews, but rather He claimed to be king of
the Jews.
22 Pilate replied, What I have written, I
have written.
23 When the soldiers had crucified
Jesus they took his clothes and, leavingJohn 19.24–29
95
aside the tunic, divided them into four
parts, one for each soldier. The tunic
was seamless, woven in one piece
throughout;
24 so they said to one another, We must
not tear this; let us toss for it. Thus the
text of scripture came true: They shared
my garments among them, and cast lots
for my clothing. That is what the soldiers
did.
25 Meanwhile near the cross on which
Jesus hung, his mother was standing
with her sister, Mary wife of Clopas, and
Mary of Magdala.
26 Seeing his mother, with the disciple
whom he loved standing beside her,
Jesus said to her, Mother, there is your
son;
27 and to the disciple, There is your
mother; and from that moment the
disciple took her into his home.
28 After this, Jesus, aware that all had
now come to its appointed end, said in
fulfilment of scripture, I am thirsty.
29 A jar stood there full of sour wine;
so they soaked a sponge with the wine,
fixed it on hyssop, and held it up to his
lips.John 19.30–37
96
30 Having received the wine, he said,
It is accomplished! Then he bowed his
head and gave up his spirit.
31 Because it was the eve of the
sabbath, the Jews were anxious that the
bodies should not remain on the crosses,
since that sabbath was a day of great
solemnity; so they requested Pilate to
have the legs broken and the bodies
taken down.
32 The soldiers accordingly came to the
men crucified with Jesus and broke the
legs of each in turn,
33 but when they came to Jesus and
found he was already dead, they did not
break his legs.
34 But one of the soldiers thrust a lance
into his side, and at once there was a
flow of blood and water.
35 This is vouched for by an eyewitness,
whose evidence is to be trusted. He
knows that he speaks the truth, so that
you too may believe;
36 for this happened in fulfilment of the
text of scripture: No bone of his shall be
broken.
37 And another text says, They shall
look on him whom they pierced.John 19.38–20.1
97
38 AFTER that, Joseph of Arimathaea,
a disciple of Jesus, but a secret disciple
for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate for
permission to remove the body of Jesus.
He consented; so Joseph came and
removed the body.
39 He was joined by Nicodemus (the
man who had visited Jesus by night),
who brought with him a mixture of
myrrh and aloes, more than half a
hundredweight.
40 They took the body of Jesus and
following Jewish burial customs they
wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of
linen cloth.
41 Near the place where he had been
crucified there was a garden, and in the
garden a new tomb, not yet used for
burial;
42 and there, since it was the eve of the
Jewish sabbath and the tomb was near
at hand, they laid Jesus.
1 EARLY on the first day of the
week, while it was still dark, Mary
of Magdala came to the tomb. She saw
that the stone had been moved away
from the entrance,
20John 20.2–10
98
2 and ran to Simon Peter and the other
disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. They
have taken the Lord out of the tomb, she
said, and we do not know where they
have laid him.
3 So Peter and the other disciple set out
and made their way to the tomb.
4 They ran together, but the other
disciple ran faster than Peter and
reached the tomb first.
5 He peered in and saw the linen
wrappings lying there, but he did not
enter.
6 Then Simon Peter caught up with him
and went into the tomb. He saw the linen
wrappings lying there,
7 and the napkin which had been round
his head, not with the wrappings but
rolled up in a place by itself.
8 Then the disciple who had reached the
tomb first also went in, and he saw and
believed;
9 until then they had not understood the
scriptures, which showed that he must
rise from the dead.
10 So the disciples went home again;John 20.11–17
99
11 but Mary stood outside the tomb
weeping. And as she wept, she peered
into the tomb,
12 and saw two angels in white sitting
there, one at the head, and one at the
feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
13 They asked her, Why are you
weeping? She answered, They have
taken my Lord away, and I do not know
where they have laid him.
14 With these words she turned round
and saw Jesus standing there, but she
did not recognize him.
15 Jesus asked her, Why are you
weeping? Who are you looking for?
Thinking it was the gardener, she said, If
it is you, sir, who removed him, tell me
where you have laid him, and I will take
him away.
16 Jesus said, Mary! She turned and
said to him, Rabbuni! (which is Hebrew
for Teacher).
17 Do not cling to me, said Jesus, for I
have not yet ascended to the Father. But
go to my brothers, and tell them that
I am ascending to my Father and your
Father, to my God and your God.John 20.18–26
100
18 Mary of Magdala went to tell the
disciples. I have seen the Lord! she said,
and gave them his message.
19 Late that same day, the first day
of the week, when the disciples were
together behind locked doors for fear of
the Jews, Jesus came and stood among
them. Peace be with you! he said;
20 then he showed them his hands and
his side. On seeing the Lord the disciples
were overjoyed.
21 Jesus said again, Peace be with you!
As the Father sent me, so I send you.
22 Then he breathed on them, saying,
Receive the Holy Spirit!
23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they
are forgiven; if you pronounce them
unforgiven, unforgiven they remain.
24 One of the Twelve, Thomas the Twin,
was not with the rest when Jesus came.
25 So the others kept telling him, We
have seen the Lord. But he said, Unless
I see the mark of the nails on his hands,
unless I put my finger into the place
where the nails were, and my hand into
his side, I will never believe it.
26 A week later his disciples were once
again in the room, and Thomas was withJohn 20.27–21.2
101
them. Although the doors were locked,
Jesus came and stood among them,
saying, Peace be with you!
27 Then he said to Thomas, Reach your
finger here; look at my hands. Reach
your hand here and put it into my side.
Be unbelieving no longer, but believe.
28 Thomas said, My Lord and my God!
29 Jesus said to him, Because you have
seen me you have found faith. Happy are
they who find faith without seeing me.
30 There were indeed many other signs
that Jesus performed in the presence of
his disciples, which are not recorded in
this book.
31 Those written here have been
recorded in order that you may believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
and that through this faith you may have
life by his name.
1 SOME time later, Jesus showed
himself to his disciples once
again, by the sea of Tiberias. This is how
it happened.
2 Simon Peter was with Thomas the
Twin, Nathanael from Cana-in-Galilee,
the sons of Zebedee, and two other
disciples.
21John 21.3–9
102
3 I am going out fishing, said Simon
Peter. We will go with you, said the
others. So they set off and got into the
boat; but that night they caught nothing.
4 Morning came, and Jesus was standing
on the beach, but the disciples did not
know that it was Jesus.
5 He called out to them, Friends,
have you caught anything? No, they
answered.
6 He said, Throw out the net to
starboard, and you will make a catch.
They did so, and found they could not
haul the net on board, there were so
many fish in it.
7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, It is the Lord! As soon as
Simon Peter heard him say, It is the
Lord, he fastened his coat about him (for
he had stripped) and plunged into the
sea.
8 The rest of them came on in the boat,
towing the net full of fish. They were
only about a hundred yards from land.
9 When they came ashore, they saw a
charcoal fire there with fish laid on it,
and some bread.John 21.10–17
103
10 Jesus said, Bring some of the fish you
have caught.
11 Simon Peter went on board and
hauled the net to land; it was full of big
fish, a hundred and fifty-three in all; and
yet, many as they were, the net was not
torn.
12 Jesus said, Come and have breakfast.
None of the disciples dared to ask Who
are you? They knew it was the Lord.
13 Jesus came, took the bread and gave
it to them, and the fish in the same way.
14 This makes the third time that
Jesus appeared to his disciples after his
resurrection from the dead.
15 After breakfast Jesus said to Simon
Peter, Simon son of John, do you love
me more than these others? Yes, Lord,
he answered, you know that I love you.
Then feed my lambs, he said.
16 A second time he asked, Simon son
of John, do you love me? Yes, Lord, you
know I love you. Then tend my sheep.
17 A third time he said, Simon son of
John, do you love me? Peter was hurt
that he asked him a third time, Do
you love me? Lord, he said, you knowJohn 21.18–23
104
everything; you know I love you. Jesus
said, Then feed my sheep.
18 In very truth I tell you: when you
were young you fastened your belt about
you and walked where you chose; but
when you are old you will stretch out
your arms, and a stranger will bind you
fast, and carry you where you have no
wish to go.
19 He said this to indicate the manner of
death by which Peter was to glorify God.
Then he added, Follow me.
20 Peter looked round, and saw the
disciple whom Jesus loved following --
the one who at supper had leaned back
close to him to ask the question, Lord,
who is it that will betray you?
21 When he saw him, Peter asked, Lord,
what about him?
22 Jesus said, If it should be my will that
he stay until I come, what is it to you?
Follow me.
23 That saying of Jesus became current
among his followers, and was taken to
mean that that disciple would not die.
But in fact Jesus did not say he would
not die; he only said, If it should be myJohn 21.24–25
105
will that he stay until I come, what is it
to you?
24 It is this same disciple who vouches
for what has been written here. He it
is who wrote it, and we know that his
testimony is true.
25 There is much else that Jesus did.
If it were all to be recorded in detail, I
suppose the world could not hold the
books that would be written.Acts
1 IN the first part of my work,
1 Theophilus, I gave an account of
all that Jesus did and taught from the
beginning
2 until the day when he was taken up to
heaven, after giving instructions through
the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he
had chosen.
3 To these men he showed himself after
his death and gave ample proof that he
was alive: he was seen by them over a
period of forty days and spoke to them
about the kingdom of God.
4 While he was in their company he
directed them not to leave Jerusalem.
You must wait, he said, for the gift
promised by the Father, of which I told
you;
5 John, as you know, baptized with
water, but within the next few days you
will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
6 When they were all together, they
asked him, Lord, is this the time at which
you are to restore sovereignty to Israel?Acts 1.7–13
2
7 He answered, It is not for you to know
about dates or times which the Father
has set within his own control.
8 But you will receive power when the
Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will
bear witness for me in Jerusalem, and
throughout all Judaea and Samaria, and
even in the farthest corners of the earth.
9 After he had said this, he was lifted up
before their very eyes, and a cloud took
him from their sight.
10 They were gazing intently into the
sky as he went, and all at once there
stood beside them two men robed in
white,
11 who said, Men of Galilee, why stand
there looking up into the sky? This Jesus
who has been taken from you up to
heaven will come in the same way as
you have seen him go.
12 THEY then returned to Jerusalem
from the hill called Olivet, which is near
the city, no farther than a sabbath day's
journey.
13 On their arrival they went to the
upstairs room where they were lodging:
Peter and John and James and Andrew,
Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew andActs 1.14–20
3
Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon
the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
14 All these with one accord were
constantly at prayer, together with a
group of women, and Mary the mother
of Jesus, and his brothers.
15 It was during this time that
Peter stood up before the assembled
brotherhood, about one hundred and
twenty in all, and said:
16 My friends, the prophecy in scripture,
which the Holy Spirit uttered concerning
Judas through the mouth of David, was
bound to come true; Judas acted as
guide to those who arrested Jesus --
17 he was one of our number and had
his place in this ministry.
18 (After buying a plot of land with
the price of his villainy, this man fell
headlong and burst open so that all his
entrails spilled out;
19 everyone in Jerusalem came to hear
of this, and in their own language they
named the plot Akeldama, which means
Blood Acre.)
20 The words I have in mind, Peter
continued, are in the book of Psalms:
Let his homestead fall desolate; let thereActs 1.21–2.2
4
be none to inhabit it. And again, Let his
charge be given to another.
21 Therefore one of those who bore us
company all the while the Lord Jesus
was going about among us,
22 from his baptism by John until the
day when he was taken up from us
-- one of those must now join us as a
witness to his resurrection.
23 Two names were put forward: Joseph,
who was known as Barsabbas and bore
the added name of Justus, and Matthias.
24 Then they prayed and said, You know
the hearts of everyone, Lord; declare
which of these two you have chosen
25 to receive this office of ministry and
apostleship which Judas abandoned to
go where he belonged.
26 They drew lots, and the lot fell to
Matthias; so he was elected to be an
apostle with the other eleven.
1 THE day of Pentecost had come,
and they were all together in one
place.
2 Suddenly there came from the sky
what sounded like a strong, driving wind,
a noise which filled the whole house
where they were sitting.
2Acts 2.3–11
5
3 And there appeared to them flames
like tongues of fire distributed among
them and coming to rest on each one.
4 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit
and began to talk in other tongues, as
the Spirit gave them power of utterance.
5 Now there were staying in Jerusalem
devout Jews drawn from every nation
under heaven.
6 At this sound a crowd of them
gathered, and were bewildered because
each one heard his own language
spoken;
7 they were amazed and in astonishment
exclaimed, Surely these people who are
speaking are all Galileans!
8 How is it that each of us can hear
them in his own native language?
9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites;
inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea
and Cappadocia, of Pontus and Asia,
10 of Phrygia and Pamphylia, of Egypt
and the districts of Libya around Cyrene;
visitors from Rome, both Jews and
proselytes;
11 Cretans and Arabs -- all of us hear
them telling in our own tongues the
great things God has done.Acts 2.12–20
6
12 They were all amazed and perplexed,
saying to one another, What can this
mean?
13 Others said contemptuously, They
have been drinking!
14 But Peter stood up with the eleven,
and in a loud voice addressed the
crowd: Fellow-Jews, and all who live in
Jerusalem, listen and take note of what I
say.
15 These people are not drunk, as you
suppose; it is only nine in the morning!
16 No, this is what the prophet Joel
spoke of:
17 In the last days, says God, I will pour
out my Spirit on all mankind; and your
sons and daughters shall prophesy; your
young men shall see visions, and your
old men shall dream dreams.
18 Yes, on my servants and my
handmaids I will pour out my Spirit in
those days, and they shall prophesy.
19 I will show portents in the sky above,
and signs on the earth below -- blood
and fire and a pall of smoke.
20 The sun shall be turned to darkness,
and the moon to blood, before thatActs 2.21–27
7
great, resplendent day, the day of the
Lord, shall come.
21 Everyone who calls on the name of
the Lord on that day shall be saved.
22 Men of Israel, hear me: I am speaking
of Jesus of Nazareth, singled out by
God and made known to you through
miracles, portents, and signs, which God
worked among you through him, as you
well know.
23 By the deliberate will and plan of God
he was given into your power, and you
killed him, using heathen men to crucify
him.
24 But God raised him to life again,
setting him free from the pangs of death,
because it could not be that death should
keep him in its grip.
25 For David says of him: I foresaw
that the Lord would be with me for ever,
with him at my right hand I cannot be
shaken;
26 therefore my heart is glad and my
tongue rejoices; moreover, my flesh
shall dwell in hope,
27 for you will not abandon me to
death, nor let your faithful servant suffer
corruption.Acts 2.28–36
8
28 You have shown me the paths of life;
your presence will fill me with joy.
29 My friends, nobody can deny that the
patriarch David died and was buried; we
have his tomb here to this very day.
30 It is clear therefore that he spoke
as a prophet who knew that God had
sworn to him that one of his own direct
descendants should sit on his throne;
31 and when he said he was not
abandoned to death, and his flesh
never saw corruption, he spoke with
foreknowledge of the resurrection of the
Messiah.
32 Now Jesus has been raised by God,
and of this we are all witnesses.
33 Exalted at God's right hand he
received from the Father the promised
Holy Spirit, and all that you now see and
hear flows from him.
34 For it was not David who went up to
heaven; his own words are: The Lord
said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand
35 until I make your enemies your
footstool.
36 Let all Israel then accept as certain
that God has made this same Jesus,Acts 2.37–43
9
whom you crucified, both Lord and
Messiah.'
37 When they heard this they were cut
to the heart, and said to Peter and the
other apostles, Friends, what are we to
do?
38 Repent, said Peter, and be baptized,
every one of you, in the name of Jesus
the Messiah; then your sins will be
forgiven and you will receive the gift of
the Holy Spirit.
39 The promise is to you and to your
children and to all who are far away, to
everyone whom the Lord our God may
call.
40 He pressed his case with many other
arguments and pleaded with them: Save
yourselves from this crooked age.
41 Those who accepted what he said
were baptized, and some three thousand
were added to the number of believers
that day.
42 They met constantly to hear the
apostles teach and to share the common
life, to break bread, and to pray.
43 A sense of awe was felt by everyone,
and many portents and signs were
brought about through the apostles.Acts 2.44–3.5
10
44 All the believers agreed to hold
everything in common:
45 they began to sell their property and
possessions and distribute to everyone
according to his need.
46 One and all they kept up their daily
attendance at the temple, and, breaking
bread in their homes, they shared their
meals with unaffected joy,
47 as they praised God and enjoyed the
favour of the whole people. And day by
day the Lord added new converts to their
number.
1 ONE day at three in the afternoon,
the hour of prayer, Peter and John
were on their way up to the temple.
2 Now a man who had been a cripple
from birth used to be carried there and
laid every day by the temple gate called
Beautiful to beg from people as they
went in.
3 When he saw Peter and John on their
way into the temple, he asked for alms.
4 They both fixed their eyes on him, and
Peter said, Look at us.
5 Expecting a gift from them, the man
was all attention.
3Acts 3.6–13
11
6 Peter said, I have no silver or gold;
but what I have I give you: in the name
of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and
walk.
7 Then, grasping him by the right hand
he helped him up; and at once his feet
and ankles grew strong;
8 he sprang to his feet, and started to
walk. He entered the temple with them,
leaping and praising God as he went.
9 Everyone saw him walking and
praising God,
10 and when they recognized him as the
man who used to sit begging at Beautiful
Gate they were filled with wonder and
amazement at what had happened to
him.
11 While he still clung to Peter and
John all the people came running in
astonishment towards them in Solomon's
Portico, as it is called.
12 Peter saw them coming and met
them with these words: Men of Israel,
why be surprised at this? Why stare at
us as if we had made this man walk by
some power or godliness of our own?
13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, the God of our fathers, has givenActs 3.14–20
12
the highest honour to his servant Jesus,
whom you handed over for trial and
disowned in Pilate's court -- disowned
the holy and righteous one when Pilate
had decided to release him. You asked
for the reprieve of a murderer,
14 (3:13)
15 and killed the Prince of life. But God
raised him from the dead; of that we are
witnesses.
16 The name of Jesus, by awakening
faith, has given strength to this man
whom you see and know, and this faith
has made him completely well as you
can all see.
17 Now, my friends, I know quite well
that you acted in ignorance, as did your
rulers;
18 but this is how God fulfilled what he
had foretold through all the prophets:
that his Messiah would suffer.
19 Repent, therefore, and turn to God,
so that your sins may be wiped out.
Then the Lord may grant you a time of
recovery
20 and send the Messiah appointed for
you, that is, Jesus.Acts 3.21–4.1
13
21 He must be received into heaven
until the time comes for the universal
restoration of which God has spoken
through his holy prophets from the
beginning.
22 Moses said, The Lord God will raise
up for you a prophet like me from among
yourselves. Listen to everything he says
to you,
23 for anyone who refuses to listen to
that prophet must be cut off from the
people.
24 From Samuel onwards, every prophet
who spoke predicted this present time.
25 You are the heirs of the prophets, and
of that covenant which God made with
your fathers when he said to Abraham,
And in your offspring all the families on
earth shall find blessing.
26 When God raised up his servant,
he sent him to you first, to bring you
blessing by turning every one of you
from your wicked ways.
1 They were still addressing the
people when the chief priests,
together with the controller of the temple
and the Sadducees, broke in on them,
4Acts 4.2–10
14
2 annoyed because they were
proclaiming the resurrection from the
dead by teaching the people about Jesus.
3 They were arrested and, as it was
already evening, put in prison for the
night.
4 But many of those who had heard the
message became believers, bringing the
number of men to about five thousand.
5 Next day the Jewish rulers, elders,
and scribes met in Jerusalem.
6 There were present Annas the high
priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and
all who were of the high-priestly family.
7 They brought the apostles before the
court and began to interrogate them.
By what power, they asked, or by what
name have such men as you done this?
8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,
answered, Rulers of the people and
elders,
9 if it is about help given to a sick man
that we are being questioned today, and
the means by which he was cured,
10 this is our answer to all of you and
to all the people of Israel: it was by the
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom
you crucified, and whom God raised fromActs 4.11–17
15
the dead; through him this man stands
here before you fit and well.
11 This Jesus is the stone, rejected by
you the builders, which has become the
corner-stone.
12 There is no salvation through anyone
else; in all the world no other name has
been granted to mankind by which we
can be saved.
13 Observing that Peter and John
were uneducated laymen, they were
astonished at their boldness and took
note that they had been companions of
Jesus;
14 but with the man who had been cured
standing in full view beside them, they
had nothing to say in reply.
15 So they ordered them to leave
the court, and then conferred among
themselves.
16 What are we to do with these men?
they said. It is common knowledge in
Jerusalem that a notable miracle has
come about through them; and we
cannot deny it.
17 But to stop this from spreading
farther among the people, we had betterActs 4.18–24
16
caution them never again to speak to
anyone in this name.
18 They then called them in and ordered
them to refrain from all public speaking
and teaching in the name of Jesus.
19 But Peter and John replied: Is it right
in the eyes of God for us to obey you
rather than him? Judge for yourselves.
20 We cannot possibly give up speaking
about what we have seen and heard.
21 With a repeated caution the court
discharged them. They could not see
how they were to punish them, because
the people were all giving glory to God
for what had happened.
22 The man upon whom this miracle of
healing had been performed was over
forty years old.
23 As soon as they were discharged
the apostles went back to their friends
and told them everything that the chief
priests and elders had said.
24 When they heard it, they raised their
voices with one accord and called upon
God. Sovereign Lord, Maker of heaven
and earth and sea and of everything in
them,Acts 4.25–31
17
25 you said by the Holy Spirit, through
the mouth of David your servant, Why
did the Gentiles rage and the peoples
hatch their futile plots?
26 The kings of the earth took their
stand and the rulers made common
cause against the Lord and against his
Messiah.
27 They did indeed make common cause
in this very city against your holy servant
Jesus whom you anointed as Messiah.
Herod and Pontius Pilate conspired with
the Gentiles and with the peoples of
Israel
28 to do all the things which, under
your hand and by your decree, were
foreordained.
29 And now, O Lord, mark their threats,
and enable those who serve you to speak
your word with all boldness.
30 Stretch out your hand to heal and
cause signs and portents to be done
through the name of your holy servant
Jesus.
31 When they had ended their prayer,
the building where they were assembled
rocked, and all were filled with theActs 4.32–5.2
18
Holy Spirit and spoke God's word with
boldness.
32 THE whole company of believers was
united in heart and soul. Not one of them
claimed any of his possessions as his
own; everything was held in common.
33 With great power the apostles bore
witness to the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus, and all were held in high esteem.
34 There was never a needy person
among them, because those who had
property in land or houses would sell it,
bring the proceeds of the sale,
35 and lay them at the feet of the
apostles, to be distributed to any who
were in need.
36 For instance Joseph, surnamed by
the apostles Barnabas (which means
Son of Encouragement), a Levite and by
birth a Cypriot,
37 sold an estate which he owned; he
brought the money and laid it at the
apostles' feet.
1 But a man called Ananias sold a
property,
2 and with the connivance of his
wife Sapphira kept back some of the
5Acts 5.3–9
19
proceeds, and brought part only to lay at
the apostles' feet.
3 Peter said, Ananias, how was it that
Satan so possessed your mind that you
lied to the Holy Spirit by keeping back
part of the price of the land?
4 While it remained unsold, did it not
remain yours? Even after it was turned
into money, was it not still at your own
disposal? What made you think of doing
this? You have lied not to men but to
God.
5 When Ananias heard these words he
dropped dead; and all who heard were
awestruck.
6 The younger men rose and covered
his body, then carried him out and buried
him.
7 About three hours passed, and his
wife came in, unaware of what had
happened.
8 Peter asked her, Tell me, were you
paid such and such a price for the land?
Yes, she replied, that was the price.
9 Peter said, Why did the two of you
conspire to put the Spirit of the Lord to
the test? Those who buried your husbandActs 5.10–16
20
are there at the door, and they will carry
you away.
10 At once she dropped dead at his feet.
When the young men came in, they
found her dead; and they carried her out
and buried her beside her husband.
11 Great awe fell on the whole church
and on all who heard of this.
12 Many signs and wonders were done
among the people by the apostles. All
the believers used to meet by common
consent in Solomon's Portico;
13 no one from outside their number
ventured to join them, yet people in
general spoke highly of them.
14 An ever-increasing number of men
and women who believed in the Lord
were added to their ranks.
15 As a result the sick were carried out
into the streets and laid there on beds
and stretchers, so that at least Peter's
shadow might fall on one or another as
he passed by;
16 and the people from the towns round
Jerusalem flocked in, bringing those who
were ill or harassed by unclean spirits,
and all were cured.Acts 5.17–24
21
17 Then the high priest and his
colleagues, the Sadducean party, were
goaded by jealousy
18 to arrest the apostles and put them
in official custody.
19 But during the night, an angel of the
Lord opened the prison doors, led them
out, and said,
20 Go, stand in the temple and tell the
people all about this new life.
21 Accordingly they entered the temple
at daybreak and went on with their
teaching. When the high priest arrived
with his colleagues they summoned
the Sanhedrin, the full Council of the
Israelite nation, and sent to the jail for
the prisoners.
22 The officers who went to the prison
failed to find them there, so they
returned and reported,
23 We found the jail securely locked at
every point, with the warders at their
posts by the doors, but on opening them
we found no one inside.
24 When they heard this, the controller
of the temple and the chief priests
were at a loss to know what could have
become of them,Acts 5.25–33
22
25 until someone came and reported:
The men you put in prison are standing
in the temple teaching the people.
26 Then the controller went off with the
officers and fetched them, but without
use of force, for fear of being stoned by
the people.
27 When they had been brought in and
made to stand before the Council, the
high priest began his examination.
28 We gave you explicit orders, he said,
to stop teaching in that name; and what
has happened? You have filled Jerusalem
with your teaching, and you are trying to
hold us responsible for that man's death.
29 Peter replied for the apostles: We
must obey God rather than men.
30 The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus; after you had put him to death by
hanging him on a gibbet,
31 God exalted him at his right hand
as leader and saviour, to grant Israel
repentance and forgiveness of sins.
32 And we are witnesses to all this, as is
the Holy Spirit who is given by God to
those obedient to him.
33 This touched them on the raw, and
they wanted to put them to death.Acts 5.34–40
23
34 But a member of the Council rose to
his feet, a Pharisee called Gamaliel, a
teacher of the law held in high regard
by all the people. He had the men put
outside for a while,
35 and then said, Men of Israel, be very
careful in deciding what to do with these
men.
36 Some time ago Theudas came
forward, making claims for himself, and
a number of our people, about four
hundred, joined him. But he was killed
and his whole movement was destroyed
and came to nothing.
37 After him came Judas the Galilean at
the time of the census; he induced some
people to revolt under his leadership, but
he too perished and his whole movement
was broken up.
38 Now, my advice to you is this: keep
clear of these men; let them alone. For
if what is being planned and done is
human in origin, it will collapse;
39 but if it is from God, you will never be
able to stamp it out, and you risk finding
yourselves at war with God.
40 Convinced by this, they sent for the
apostles and had them flogged; thenActs 5.41–6.4
24
they ordered them to give up speaking
in the name of Jesus, and discharged
them.
41 The apostles went out from the
Council rejoicing that they had been
found worthy to suffer humiliation for
the sake of the name.
42 And every day they went steadily on
with their teaching in the temple and in
private houses, telling the good news of
Jesus the Messiah.
1 DURING this period, when disciples
were growing in number, a grievance
arose on the part of those who spoke
Greek, against those who spoke the
language of the Jews; they complained
that their widows were being overlooked
in the daily distribution.
2 The Twelve called the whole company
of disciples together and said, It would
not be fitting for us to neglect the word of
God in order to assist in the distribution.
3 Therefore, friends, pick seven men of
good repute from your number, men full
of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will
appoint them for this duty;
4 then we can devote ourselves to
prayer and to the ministry of the word.
6Acts 6.5–11
25
5 This proposal proved acceptable
to the whole company. They elected
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the
Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus,
Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas
of Antioch, who had been a convert to
Judaism,
6 and presented them to the apostles,
who prayed and laid their hands on
them.
7 The word of God spread more and
more widely; the number of disciples in
Jerusalem was increasing rapidly, and
very many of the priests adhered to the
faith.
8 Stephen, full of grace and power,
began to do great wonders and signs
among the people.
9 Some members of the synagogue
called the Synagogue of Freedmen,
comprising Cyrenians and Alexandrians
and people from Cilicia and Asia, came
forward and argued with Stephen,
10 but could not hold their own against
the inspired wisdom with which he
spoke.
11 They then put up men to allege that
they had heard him make blasphemousActs 6.12–7.3
26
statements against Moses and against
God.
12 They stirred up the people and the
elders and scribes, set upon him and
seized him, and brought him before the
Council.
13 They produced false witnesses who
said, This fellow is for ever saying things
against this holy place and against the
law.
14 For we have heard him say this Jesus
of Nazareth will destroy this place and
alter the customs handed down to us by
Moses.
15 All who were sitting in the Council
fixed their eyes on him, and his face
seemed to them like the face of an angel.
1 Then the high priest asked him, Is
this true?
2 He replied, My brothers, fathers of this
nation, listen to me. The God of glory
appeared to Abraham our ancestor while
he was in Mesopotamia, before he had
settled in Harran,
3 and said: Leave your country and your
kinsfolk, and come away to a land that I
will show you.
7Acts 7.4–9
27
4 Thereupon he left the land of the
Chaldaeans and settled in Harran. From
there, after his father's death, God led
him to migrate to this land where you
now live.
5 He gave him no foothold in it, nothing
to call his own, but promised to give it as
a possession for ever to him and to his
descendants after him, though he was
then childless.
6 This is what God said: Abraham's
descendants shall live as aliens in
a foreign land, held in slavery and
oppression for four hundred years.
7 And I will pass judgement, he said, on
the nation whose slaves they are; and
after that they shall escape and worship
me in this place.
8 God gave Abraham the covenant
of circumcision, and so, when his son
Isaac was born, he circumcised him
on the eighth day; and Isaac was the
father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve
patriarchs.
9 The patriarchs out of jealousy sold
Joseph into slavery in Egypt, but God
was with himActs 7.10–17
28
10 and rescued him from all his
troubles. He gave him wisdom which
so commended him to Pharaoh king of
Egypt that he appointed him governor of
Egypt and of the whole royal household.
11 When famine struck all Egypt and
Canaan, causing great distress, and our
ancestors could find nothing to eat,
12 Jacob heard that there was food in
Egypt and sent our fathers there. This
was their first visit.
13 On the second visit Joseph made
himself known to his brothers, and his
ancestry was disclosed to Pharaoh.
14 Joseph sent for his father Jacob and
the whole family, seventy-five persons in
all;
15 and Jacob went down into Egypt.
There he and our fathers ended their
days.
16 Their remains were later removed
to Shechem and buried in the tomb for
which Abraham paid a sum of money to
the sons of Hamor at Shechem.
17 Now as the time approached for God
to fulfil the promise he had made to
Abraham, our people in Egypt grew and
increased in numbers.Acts 7.18–25
29
18 At length another king, who knew
nothing of Joseph, ascended the throne
of Egypt.
19 He employed cunning to harm our
race, and forced our ancestors to expose
their children so that they should not
survive.
20 It was at this time that Moses was
born. He was a fine child, and pleasing
to God. For three months he was nursed
in his father's house;
21 then when he was exposed, Pharaoh's
daughter adopted him and brought him
up as her own son.
22 So Moses was trained in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians, a powerful
speaker and a man of action.
23 He was approaching the age of forty,
when it occurred to him to visit his
fellow-countrymen the Israelites.
24 Seeing one of them being ill-treated,
he went to his aid, and avenged the
victim by striking down the Egyptian.
25 He thought his countrymen would
understand that God was offering them
deliverance through him, but they did
not understand.Acts 7.26–34
30
26 The next day he came upon two of
them fighting, and tried to persuade
them to make up their quarrel. Men,
you are brothers! he said. Why are you
ill-treating one another?
27 But the man who was at fault pushed
him away. Who made you ruler and
judge over us? he said.
28 Are you going to kill me as you killed
the Egyptian yesterday?
29 At this Moses fled the country and
settled in Midianite territory. There two
sons were born to him.
30 After forty years had passed, an
angel appeared to him in the flame of a
burning bush in the desert near Mount
Sinai.
31 Moses was amazed at the sight, and
as he approached to look more closely,
the voice of the Lord came to him:
32 I am the God of your fathers, the God
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses
was terrified and did not dare to look.
33 Then the Lord said to him, Take off
your sandals; the place where you are
standing is holy ground.
34 I have indeed seen how my people
are oppressed in Egypt and have heardActs 7.35–40
31
their groans; and I have come down to
rescue them. Come now, I will send you
to Egypt.
35 This Moses, whom they had rejected
with the words, Who made you ruler
and judge? -- this very man was
commissioned as ruler and liberator by
God himself, speaking through the angel
who appeared to him in the bush.
36 It was Moses who led them out, doing
signs and wonders in Egypt, at the Red
Sea, and for forty years in the desert.
37 It was he who said to the Israelites,
God will raise up for you from among
yourselves a prophet like me.
38 It was he again who, in the assembly
in the desert, kept company with the
angel, who spoke to him on Mount Sinai,
and with our forefathers, and received
the living utterances of God to pass on
to us.
39 Our forefathers would not accept his
leadership but thrust him aside. They
wished themselves back in Egypt,
40 and said to Aaron, Make us gods to
go before us. As for this fellow Moses,
who brought us out of Egypt, we do not
know what has become of him.Acts 7.41–46
32
41 That was when they made the
bull-calf and offered sacrifice to the idol,
and held festivities in honour of what
their hands had made.
42 So God turned away from them and
gave them over to the worship of the
host of heaven, as it stands written in
the book of the prophets: Did you bring
me victims and offerings those forty
years in the desert, you people of Israel?
43 No, you carried aloft the shrine of
Moloch and the star of the god Rephan,
the images which you had made for
your adoration. I will banish you beyond
Babylon.
44 Our forefathers had the Tent of
the Testimony in the desert, as God
commanded when he told Moses to make
it after the pattern which he had seen.
45 In the next generation, our fathers
under Joshua brought it with them when
they dispossessed the nations whom
God drove out before them, and so it
was until the time of David.
46 David found favour with God and
begged leave to provide a dwelling-place
for the God of Jacob;Acts 7.47–55
33
47 but it was Solomon who built him a
house.
48 However, the Most High does not live
in houses made by men; as the prophet
says:
49 Heaven is my throne and earth my
footstool. What kind of house will you
build for me, says the Lord; where shall
my resting-place be?
50 Are not all these things of my own
making?
51 How stubborn you are, heathen still
at heart and deaf to the truth! You
always resist the Holy Spirit. You are just
like your fathers!
52 Was there ever a prophet your fathers
did not persecute? They killed those who
foretold the coming of the righteous one,
and now you have betrayed him and
murdered him.
53 You received the law given by God's
angels and yet you have not kept it.
54 This touched them on the raw, and
they ground their teeth with fury.
55 But Stephen, filled with the Holy
Spirit, and gazing intently up to heaven,
saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
at God's right hand.Acts 7.56–8.3
34
56 Look! he said. I see the heavens
opened and the Son of Man standing at
the right hand of God.
57 At this they gave a great shout,
and stopped their ears; they made a
concerted rush at him,
58 threw him out of the city, and set
about stoning him. The witnesses laid
their coats at the feet of a young man
named Saul.
59 As they stoned him Stephen called
out, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
60 He fell on his knees and cried aloud,
Lord, do not hold this sin against them,
and with that he died.
1 Saul was among those who
approved of his execution. THAT
day was the beginning of a time of
violent persecution for the church in
Jerusalem; and all except the apostles
were scattered over the country districts
of Judaea and Samaria.
2 Stephen was given burial by devout
men, who made a great lamentation for
him.
3 Saul, meanwhile, was harrying the
church; he entered house after house,
8Acts 8.4–11
35
seizing men and women and sending
them to prison.
4 As for those who had been scattered,
they went through the country preaching
the word.
5 Philip came down to a city in Samaria
and began proclaiming the Messiah
there.
6 As the crowds heard Philip and saw
the signs he performed, everyone paid
close attention to what he had to say.
7 In many cases of possession the
unclean spirits came out with a loud cry,
and many paralysed and crippled folk
were cured;
8 and there was great rejoicing in that
city.
9 A man named Simon had been in the
city for some time and had captivated
the Samaritans with his magical arts,
making large claims for himself.
10 Everybody, high and low, listened
intently to him. This man, they said, is
that power of God which is called The
Great Power.
11 They listened because they had for
so long been captivated by his magic.Acts 8.12–18
36
12 But when they came to believe Philip,
with his good news about the kingdom of
God and the name of Jesus Christ, men
and women alike were baptized.
13 Even Simon himself believed, and
after his baptism was constantly in
Philip's company. He was captivated
when he saw the powerful signs and
miracles that were taking place.
14 When the apostles in Jerusalem
heard that Samaria had accepted the
word of God, they sent off Peter and
John,
15 who went down there and prayed
for the converts, asking that they might
receive the Holy Spirit.
16 Until then the Spirit had not come
upon any of them; they had been
baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus,
that and nothing more.
17 So Peter and John laid their hands on
them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
18 When Simon observed that the Spirit
was bestowed through the laying on of
the apostles' hands, he offered them
moneyActs 8.19–27
37
19 and said, Give me too the same
power, so that anyone I lay my hands on
will receive the Holy Spirit.
20 Peter replied, You thought God's gift
was for sale? Your money can go with
you to damnation!
21 You have neither part nor share in
this, for you are corrupt in the eyes of
God.
22 Repent of this wickedness of yours
and pray the Lord to forgive you for
harbouring such a thought.
23 I see that bitter gall and the chains of
sin will be your fate.
24 Simon said to them, Pray to the Lord
for me, and ask that none of the things
you have spoken of may befall me.
25 After giving their testimony and
speaking the word of the Lord, they took
the road back to Jerusalem, bringing the
good news to many Samaritan villages
on the way.
26 Then the angel of the Lord said to
Philip, Start out and go south to the road
that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
(This is the desert road.)
27 He set out and was on his way when
he caught sight of an Ethiopian. ThisActs 8.28–34
38
man was a eunuch, a high official of
the Kandake, or queen, of Ethiopia, in
charge of all her treasure; he had been
to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage
28 and was now returning home, sitting
in his carriage and reading aloud from
the prophet Isaiah.
29 The Spirit said to Philip, Go and meet
the carriage.
30 When Philip ran up he heard him
reading from the prophet Isaiah and
asked, Do you understand what you are
reading?
31 He said, How can I without someone
to guide me? and invited Philip to get in
and sit beside him.
32 The passage he was reading was this:
He was led like a sheep to the slaughter;
like a lamb that is dumb before the
shearer, he does not open his mouth.
33 He has been humiliated and has no
redress. Who will be able to speak of
his posterity? For he is cut off from the
world of the living.
34 Please tell me, said the eunuch
to Philip, who it is that the prophet
is speaking about here: himself or
someone else?Acts 8.35–9.2
39
35 Then Philip began and, starting from
this passage, he told him the good news
of Jesus.
36 As they were going along the road,
they came to some water. Look, said the
eunuch, here is water: what is to prevent
my being baptized?
37 [[EMPTY]]
38 and he ordered the carriage to stop.
Then they both went down into the
water, Philip and the eunuch, and he
baptized him.
39 When they came up from the water
the Spirit snatched Philip away; the
eunuch did not see him again, but went
on his way rejoicing.
40 Philip appeared at Azotus, and toured
the country, preaching in all the towns
till he reached Caesarea.
1 SAUL, still breathing murderous
threats against the Lord's disciples,
went to the high priest
2 and applied for letters to the
synagogues at Damascus authorizing
him to arrest any followers of the new
way whom he found, men or women,
and bring them to Jerusalem.
9Acts 9.3–11
40
3 While he was still on the road and
nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from
the sky flashed all around him.
4 He fell to the ground and heard a
voice saying, Saul, Saul, why are you
persecuting me?
5 Tell me, Lord, he said, who you are.
The voice answered, I am Jesus, whom
you are persecuting.
6 But now get up and go into the city,
and you will be told what you have to do.
7 Meanwhile the men who were
travelling with him stood speechless;
they heard the voice but could see no
one.
8 Saul got up from the ground, but when
he opened his eyes he could not see;
they led him by the hand and brought
him into Damascus.
9 He was blind for three days, and took
no food or drink.
10 There was in Damascus a disciple
named Ananias. He had a vision in which
he heard the Lord say: Ananias! Here I
am, Lord, he answered.
11 The Lord said to him, Go to Straight
Street, to the house of Judas, and askActs 9.12–18
41
for a man from Tarsus named Saul. You
will find him at prayer;
12 he has had a vision of a man named
Ananias coming in and laying hands on
him to restore his sight.
13 Ananias answered, Lord, I have often
heard about this man and all the harm
he has done your people in Jerusalem.
14 Now he is here with authority from
the chief priests to arrest all who invoke
your name.
15 But the Lord replied, You must go,
for this man is my chosen instrument
to bring my name before the nations
and their kings, and before the people of
Israel.
16 I myself will show him all that he
must go through for my name's sake.
17 So Ananias went and, on entering the
house, laid his hands on him and said,
Saul, my brother, the Lord Jesus, who
appeared to you on your way here, has
sent me to you so that you may recover
your sight and be filled with the Holy
Spirit.
18 Immediately it was as if scales had
fallen from his eyes, and he regained his
sight. He got up and was baptized,Acts 9.19–26
42
19 and when he had eaten his strength
returned. He stayed some time with the
disciples in Damascus.
20 Without delay he proclaimed Jesus
publicly in the synagogues, declaring
him to be the Son of God.
21 All who heard were astounded. Is
not this the man, they said, who was
in Jerusalem hunting down those who
invoke this name? Did he not come here
for the sole purpose of arresting them
and taking them before the chief priests?
22 But Saul went from strength to
strength, and confounded the Jews of
Damascus with his cogent proofs that
Jesus was the Messiah.
23 When some time had passed, the
Jews hatched a plot against his life;
24 but their plans became known to
Saul. They kept watch on the city gates
day and night so that they might murder
him;
25 but one night some disciples took
him and, lowering him in a basket, let
him down over the wall.
26 On reaching Jerusalem he tried to
join the disciples, but they were all afraidActs 9.27–33
43
of him, because they did not believe that
he really was a disciple.
27 Barnabas, however, took him and
introduced him to the apostles; he
described to them how on his journey
Saul had seen the Lord and heard his
voice, and how at Damascus he had
spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus.
28 Saul now stayed with them, moving
about freely in Jerusalem.
29 He spoke out boldly and openly in the
name of the Lord, talking and debating
with the Greek-speaking Jews. But they
planned to murder him,
30 and when the brethren discovered
this they escorted him down to Caesarea
and sent him away to Tarsus.
31 MEANWHILE the church, throughout
Judaea, Galilee, and Samaria, was left
in peace to build up its strength, and to
live in the fear of the Lord. Encouraged
by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers.
32 In the course of a tour Peter was
making throughout the region he went
down to visit God's people at Lydda.
33 There he found a man named Aeneas
who had been bedridden with paralysis
for eight years.Acts 9.34–40
44
34 Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus
Christ cures you; get up and make your
bed! and immediately he stood up.
35 All who lived in Lydda and Sharon
saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
36 In Joppa there was a disciple named
Tabitha (in Greek, Dorcas, meaning
Gazelle), who filled her days with acts of
kindness and charity.
37 At that time she fell ill and died; and
they washed her body and laid it in a
room upstairs.
38 As Lydda was near Joppa, the
disciples, who had heard that Peter was
there, sent two men to him with the
urgent request, Please come over to us
without delay.
39 At once Peter went off with them.
When he arrived he was taken up to
the room, and all the widows came and
stood round him in tears, showing him
the shirts and coats that Dorcas used to
make while she was with them.
40 Peter sent them all outside, and knelt
down and prayed; then, turning towards
the body, he said, Tabitha, get up. She
opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up.Acts 9.41–10.5
45
41 He gave her his hand and helped her
to her feet. Then he called together the
members of the church and the widows
and showed her to them alive.
42 News of it spread all over Joppa, and
many came to believe in the Lord.
43 Peter stayed on in Joppa for some
time at the house of a tanner named
Simon.
1 At Caesarea there was a man
named Cornelius, a centurion in
the Italian Cohort, as it was called.
2 He was a devout man, and he and
his whole family joined in the worship
of God; he gave generously to help the
Jewish people, and was regular in his
prayers to God.
3 One day about three in the afternoon
he had a vision in which he clearly saw
an angel of God come into his room and
say, Cornelius!
4 Cornelius stared at him in terror. What
is it, my lord? he asked. The angel said,
Your prayers and acts of charity have
gone up to heaven to speak for you
before God.
5 Now send to Joppa for a man named
Simon, also called Peter:
10Acts 10.6–14
46
6 he is lodging with another Simon, a
tanner, whose house is by the sea.
7 When the angel who spoke to him
had gone, he summoned two of his
servants and a military orderly who was
a religious man,
8 told them the whole story, and ordered
them to Joppa.
9 Next day about noon, while they were
still on their way and approaching the
city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
10 He grew hungry and wanted
something to eat, but while they were
getting it ready, he fell into a trance.
11 He saw heaven opened, and
something coming down that looked like
a great sheet of sailcloth; it was slung by
the four corners and was being lowered
to the earth,
12 and in it he saw creatures of every
kind, four-footed beasts, reptiles, and
birds.
13 There came a voice which said to
him, Get up, Peter, kill and eat.
14 But Peter answered, No, Lord! I
have never eaten anything profane or
unclean.Acts 10.15–22
47
15 The voice came again, a second time:
It is not for you to call profane what God
counts clean.
16 This happened three times, and then
the thing was taken up into heaven.
17 While Peter was still puzzling over
the meaning of the vision he had seen,
the messengers from Cornelius had been
asking the way to Simon's house, and
now arrived at the entrance.
18 They called out and asked if Simon
Peter was lodging there.
19 Peter was thinking over the vision,
when the Spirit said to him, Some men
are here looking for you;
20 get up and go downstairs. You may
go with them without any misgiving, for
it was I who sent them.
21 Peter came down to the men and
said, You are looking for me? Here I am.
What brings you here?
22 We are from the centurion Cornelius,
they replied, a good and religious man,
acknowledged as such by the whole
Jewish nation. He was directed by a holy
angel to send for you to his house and
hear what you have to say.Acts 10.23–30
48
23 So Peter asked them in and gave
them a night's lodging. Next day he set
out with them, accompanied by some
members of the congregation at Joppa,
24 and on the following day arrived at
Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them
and had called together his relatives and
close friends.
25 When Peter arrived, Cornelius came
to meet him, and bowed to the ground
in deep reverence.
26 But Peter raised him to his feet and
said, Stand up; I am only a man like
you.
27 Still talking with him he went in and
found a large gathering.
28 He said to them, I need not tell you
that a Jew is forbidden by his religion to
visit or associate with anyone of another
race. Yet God has shown me clearly
that I must not call anyone profane or
unclean;
29 that is why I came here without
demur when you sent for me. May I ask
what was your reason for doing so?
30 Cornelius said, Three days ago, just
about this time, I was in the house here
saying the afternoon prayers, whenActs 10.31–38
49
suddenly a man in shining robes stood
before me.
31 He said: Cornelius, your prayer has
been heard and your acts of charity have
spoken for you before God.
32 Send to Simon Peter at Joppa, and
ask him to come; he is lodging in the
house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.
33 I sent to you there and then, and
you have been good enough to come. So
now we are all met here before God, to
listen to everything that the Lord has
instructed you to say.
34 Peter began: I now understand how
true it is that God has no favourites,
35 but that in every nation those who
are god-fearing and do what is right are
acceptable to him.
36 He sent his word to the Israelites and
gave the good news of peace through
Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
37 I need not tell you what has happened
lately all over the land of the Jews,
starting from Galilee after the baptism
proclaimed by John.
38 You know how God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with
power. Because God was with him heActs 10.39–45
50
went about doing good and healing all
who were oppressed by the devil.
39 And we can bear witness to all that
he did in the Jewish countryside and
in Jerusalem. They put him to death,
hanging him on a gibbet;
40 but God raised him to life on the third
day, and allowed him to be clearly seen,
41 not by the whole people, but by
witnesses whom God had chosen in
advance -- by us, who ate and drank
with him after he rose from the dead.
42 He commanded us to proclaim him to
the people, and affirm that he is the one
designated by God as judge of the living
and the dead.
43 It is to him that all the prophets
testify, declaring that everyone who
trusts in him receives forgiveness of sins
through his name.
44 Peter was still speaking when the
Holy Spirit came upon all who were
listening to the message.
45 The believers who had come with
Peter, men of Jewish birth, were amazed
that the gift of the Holy Spirit should
have been poured out even on Gentiles,Acts 10.46–11.5
51
46 for they could hear them speaking in
tongues of ecstasy and acclaiming the
greatness of God. Then Peter spoke:
47 Is anyone prepared to withhold the
water of baptism from these persons,
who have received the Holy Spirit just as
we did?
48 Then he ordered them to be baptized
in the name of Jesus Christ. After that
they asked him to stay on with them for
a time.
1 News came to the apostles and
the members of the church in
Judaea that Gentiles too had accepted
the word of God;
2 and when Peter came up to Jerusalem
those who were of Jewish birth took
issue with him.
3 You have been visiting men who are
uncircumcised, they said, and sitting at
table with them!
4 Peter began by laying before them the
facts as they had happened.
5 I was at prayer in the city of Joppa,
he said, and while in a trance I had a
vision: I saw something coming down
that looked like a great sheet of sailcloth,
11Acts 11.6–14
52
slung by the four corners and lowered
from heaven till it reached me.
6 I looked intently to make out what
was in it and I saw four-footed beasts,
wild animals, reptiles, and birds.
7 Then I heard a voice saying to me,
Get up, Peter, kill and eat.
8 But I said, No, Lord! Nothing profane
or unclean has ever entered my mouth.
9 A voice from heaven came a second
time: It is not for you to call profane
what God counts clean.
10 This happened three times, and
then they were all drawn up again into
heaven.
11 At that very moment three men who
had been sent to me from Caesarea
arrived at the house where I was staying;
12 and the Spirit told me to go with
them. My six companions here came
with me and we went into the man's
house.
13 He told us how he had seen an angel
standing in his house who said, Send to
Joppa for Simon Peter.
14 He will speak words that will bring
salvation to you and all your household.Acts 11.15–20
53
15 Hardly had I begun speaking, when
the Holy Spirit came upon them, just as
upon us at the beginning,
16 and I recalled what the Lord had
said: John baptized with water, but you
will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
17 God gave them no less a gift than he
gave us when we came to believe in the
Lord Jesus Christ. How could I stand in
God's way?
18 When they heard this their doubts
were silenced, and they gave praise to
God. This means, they said, that God
has granted life-giving repentance to the
Gentiles also.
19 MEANWHILE those who had been
scattered after the persecution that
arose over Stephen made their way to
Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, bringing
the message to Jews only and to no
others.
20 But there were some natives of
Cyprus and Cyrene among them, and
these, when they arrived at Antioch,
began to speak to Gentiles as well,
telling them the good news of the Lord
Jesus.Acts 11.21–28
54
21 The power of the Lord was with them,
and a great many became believers and
turned to the Lord.
22 The news reached the ears of the
church in Jerusalem; and they sent
Barnabas to Antioch.
23 When he arrived and saw the
divine grace at work, he rejoiced and
encouraged them all to hold fast to the
Lord with resolute hearts,
24 for he was a good man, full of
the Holy Spirit and of faith. And large
numbers were won over to the Lord.
25 He then went off to Tarsus to look for
Saul;
26 and when he had found him, he
brought him to Antioch. For a whole year
the two of them lived in fellowship with
the church there, and gave instruction to
large numbers. It was in Antioch that the
disciples first got the name of Christians.
27 During this period some prophets
came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,
28 and one of them, Agabus by name,
was inspired to stand up and predict a
severe and world-wide famine, which in
fact occurred in the reign of Claudius.Acts 11.29–12.6
55
29 So the disciples agreed to make
a contribution, each according to
his means, for the relief of their
fellow-Christians in Judaea.
30 This they did, and sent it off to the
elders, entrusting it to Barnabas and
Saul.
1 IT was about this time that King
Herod launched an attack on
certain members of the church.
2 He beheaded James, the brother of
John,
3 and, when he saw that the Jews
approved, proceeded to arrest Peter
also. This happened during the festival
of Unleavened Bread.
4 Having secured him, he put him in
prison under a military guard, four
squads of four men each, meaning to
produce him in public after Passover.
5 So, while Peter was held in prison, the
church kept praying fervently to God for
him.
6 On the very night before Herod had
planned to produce him, Peter was
asleep between two soldiers, secured
by two chains, while outside the doors
sentries kept guard over the prison.
12Acts 12.7–12
56
7 All at once an angel of the Lord stood
there, and the cell was ablaze with light.
He tapped Peter on the shoulder to wake
him. Quick! Get up! he said, and the
chains fell away from Peter's wrists.
8 The angel said, Do up your belt and
put on your sandals. He did so. Now
wrap your cloak round you and follow
me.
9 Peter followed him out, with no idea
that the angel's intervention was real:
he thought it was just a vision.
10 They passed the first guard-post,
then the second, and reached the iron
gate leading out into the city. This
opened for them of its own accord; they
came out and had walked the length of
one street when suddenly the angel left
him.
11 Then Peter came to himself. Now I
know it is true, he said: the Lord has
sent his angel and rescued me from
Herod's clutches and from all that the
Jewish people were expecting.
12 Once he had realized this, he made
for the house of Mary, the mother of
John Mark, where a large company was
at prayer.Acts 12.13–19
57
13 He knocked at the outer door and
a maidservant called Rhoda came to
answer it.
14 She recognized Peter's voice and was
so overjoyed that instead of opening
the door she ran in and announced that
Peter was standing outside.
15 You are crazy, they told her; but she
insisted that it was so. Then they said, It
must be his angel.
16 Peter went on knocking, and when
they opened the door and saw him, they
were astounded.
17 He motioned to them with his hand
to keep quiet, and described to them
how the Lord had brought him out of
prison. Tell James and the members of
the church, he said. Then he left the
house and went off elsewhere.
18 When morning came, there was
consternation among the soldiers: what
could have become of Peter?
19 Herod made careful search, but
failed to find him, so he interrogated
the guards and ordered their execution.
Afterwards Herod left Judaea to reside
for a while at Caesarea.Acts 12.20–13.1
58
20 He had for some time been very
angry with the people of Tyre and
Sidon, who now by common agreement
presented themselves at his court.
There they won over Blastus the royal
chamberlain, and sued for peace,
because their country drew its supplies
from the king's territory.
21 On an appointed day Herod, attired
in his royal robes and seated on the
rostrum, addressed the populace;
22 they responded, It is a god speaking,
not a man!
23 Instantly an angel of the Lord struck
him down, because he had usurped the
honour due to God; he was eaten up
with worms and so died.
24 Meanwhile the word of God continued
to grow and spread;
25 and Barnabas and Saul, their task
fulfilled, returned from Jerusalem, taking
John Mark with them.
1 THERE were in the church at
Antioch certain prophets and
teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger,
Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, a close friend
of Prince Herod, and Saul.
13Acts 13.2–9
59
2 While they were offering worship to
the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me, to
do the work to which I have called them.
3 Then, after further fasting and prayer,
they laid their hands on them and sent
them on their way.
4 These two, sent out on their mission by
the Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia,
and from there sailed to Cyprus.
5 Arriving at Salamis, they declared the
word of God in the Jewish synagogues;
they had John with them as their
assistant.
6 They went through the whole island
as far as Paphos, and there they came
upon a sorcerer, a Jew who posed as a
prophet, Barjesus by name.
7 He was in the retinue of the governor,
Sergius Paulus, a learned man, who had
sent for Barnabas and Saul and wanted
to hear the word of God.
8 This Elymas the sorcerer (so his name
may be translated) opposed them, trying
to turn the governor away from the faith.
9 But Saul, also known as Paul, filled
with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on
himActs 13.10–15
60
10 and said, You are a swindler, an
out-and-out fraud! You son of the devil
and enemy of all goodness, will you
never stop perverting the straight ways
of the Lord?
11 Look now, the hand of the Lord
strikes: you shall be blind, and for a time
you shall not see the light of the sun. At
once mist and darkness came over his
eyes, and he groped about for someone
to lead him by the hand.
12 When the governor saw what had
happened he became a believer, deeply
impressed by what he learnt about the
Lord.
13 Sailing from Paphos, Paul and his
companions went to Perga in Pamphylia;
John, however, left them and returned to
Jerusalem.
14 From Perga they continued their
journey as far as Pisidian Antioch. On
the sabbath they went to synagogue and
took their seats;
15 and after the readings from the law
and the prophets, the officials of the
synagogue sent this message to them:
Friends, if you have anything to say toActs 13.16–22
61
the people by way of exhortation, let us
hear it.
16 Paul stood up, raised his hand for
silence, and began. Listen, men of Israel
and you others who worship God!
17 The God of this people, Israel, chose
our forefathers. When they were still
living as aliens in Egypt, he made
them into a great people and, with arm
outstretched, brought them out of that
country.
18 For some forty years he bore with
their conduct in the desert.
19 Then in the Canaanite country, after
overthrowing seven nations, whose lands
he gave them to be their heritage
20 for some four hundred and fifty
years, he appointed judges for them
until the time of the prophet Samuel.
21 It was then that they asked for a
king, and God gave them Saul son of
Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin. He
reigned for forty years
22 before God removed him and
appointed David as their king, with this
commendation: I have found David the
son of Jesse to be a man after my own
heart; he will carry out all my purposes.Acts 13.23–29
62
23 This is the man from whose
descendants God, as he promised, has
brought Israel a saviour, Jesus.
24 John had made ready for his coming
by proclaiming a baptism in token of
repentance to the whole people of Israel;
25 and, nearing the end of his earthly
course, John said, I am not the one
you think I am. No, after me comes
one whose sandals I am not worthy to
unfasten.
26 My brothers, who come of Abraham's
stock, and others among you who
worship God, we are the people to whom
this message of salvation has been sent.
27 The people of Jerusalem and
their rulers did not recognize Jesus,
or understand the words of the
prophets which are read sabbath by
sabbath; indeed, they fulfilled them by
condemning him.
28 Though they failed to find grounds
for the sentence of death, they asked
Pilate to have him executed.
29 When they had carried out all that
the scriptures said about him, they took
him down from the gibbet and laid him
in a tomb.Acts 13.30–37
63
30 But God raised him from the dead;
31 and over a period of many days he
appeared to those who had come up with
him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they
are now his witnesses before our people.
32 We are here to give you the good
news that God, who made the promise
to the fathers,
33 has fulfilled it for the children by
raising Jesus from the dead, as indeed it
stands written in the second Psalm: You
are my son; this day I have begotten
you.
34 Again, that he raised him from
the dead, never to be subjected to
corruption, he declares in these words:
I will give you the blessings promised to
David, holy and sure.
35 This is borne out by another passage:
You will not let your faithful servant
suffer corruption.
36 As for David, when he had served the
purpose of God in his own generation,
he died and was gathered to his fathers,
and suffered corruption;
37 but the one whom God raised up did
not suffer corruption.Acts 13.38–45
64
38 You must understand, my brothers, it
is through him that forgiveness of sins is
now being proclaimed to you.
39 It is through him that everyone who
has faith is acquitted of everything for
which there was no acquittal under the
law of Moses.
40 Beware, then, lest you bring down
upon yourselves the doom proclaimed
by the prophets:
41 See this, you scoffers, marvel, and
begone; for I am doing a deed in your
days, a deed which you will never believe
when you are told of it.
42 As they were leaving the synagogue
they were asked to come again and
speak on these subjects next sabbath;
43 and after the congregation had
dispersed, many Jews and gentile
worshippers went with Paul and
Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged
them to hold fast to the grace of God.
44 On the following sabbath almost the
whole city gathered to hear the word of
God.
45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they
were filled with jealous resentment, andActs 13.46–50
65
contradicted what Paul had said with
violent abuse.
46 But Paul and Barnabas were
outspoken in their reply. It was
necessary, they said, that the word of
God should be declared to you first. But
since you reject it and judge yourselves
unworthy of eternal life, we now turn to
the Gentiles.
47 For these are our instructions from
the Lord: I have appointed you to be a
light for the Gentiles, and a means of
salvation to earth's farthest bounds.
48 When the Gentiles heard this, they
were overjoyed and thankfully acclaimed
the word of the Lord, and those who
were marked out for eternal life became
believers.
49 Thus the word of the Lord spread
throughout the region.
50 But the Jews stirred up feeling among
those worshippers who were women of
standing, and among the leading men of
the city; a campaign of persecution was
started against Paul and Barnabas, and
they were expelled from the district.Acts 13.51–14.6
66
51 They shook the dust off their feet
in protest against them and went to
Iconium.
52 And the disciples were filled with joy
and with the Holy Spirit.
1 At Iconium they went together
into the Jewish synagogue
and spoke to such purpose that Jews
and Greeks in large numbers became
believers.
2 But the unconverted Jews stirred up
the Gentiles and poisoned their minds
against the Christians.
3 So Paul and Barnabas stayed on for
some time, and spoke boldly and openly
in reliance on the Lord, who confirmed
the message of his grace by enabling
them to work signs and miracles.
4 The populace was divided, some siding
with the Jews, others with the apostles.
5 A move was made by Gentiles and
Jews together, with the connivance of
the city authorities, to maltreat them
and stone them,
6 and when they became aware of
this, they made their escape to the
Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and
the surrounding country.
14Acts 14.7–15
67
7 There they continued to spread the
good news.
8 At Lystra a cripple, lame from birth,
who had never walked in his life,
9 sat listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul
fixed his eyes on him and, seeing that he
had the faith to be cured,
10 said in a loud voice, Stand up straight
on your feet; and he sprang up and
began to walk.
11 When the crowds saw what Paul
had done, they shouted, in their native
Lycaonian, The gods have come down to
us in human form!
12 They called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul
they called Hermes, because he was the
spokesman.
13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was
just outside the city, brought oxen and
garlands to the gates, and he and the
people were about to offer sacrifice.
14 But when the apostles Barnabas and
Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes
and rushed into the crowd shouting,
15 Men, why are you doing this? We
are human beings, just like you. The
good news we bring tells you to turn
from these follies to the living God, whoActs 14.16–22
68
made heaven and earth and sea and
everything in them.
16 In past ages he has allowed all
nations to go their own way;
17 and yet he has not left you without
some clue to his nature, in the benefits
he bestows: he sends you rain from
heaven and the crops in their seasons,
and gives you food in plenty and keeps
you in good heart.
18 Even with these words they barely
managed to prevent the crowd from
offering sacrifice to them.
19 Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium
came on the scene and won over the
crowds. They stoned Paul, and dragged
him out of the city, thinking him dead.
20 The disciples formed a ring round
him, and he got to his feet and went into
the city. Next day he left with Barnabas
for Derbe.
21 After bringing the good news to that
town and gaining many converts, they
returned to Lystra, then to Iconium, and
then to Antioch,
22 strengthening the disciples and
encouraging them to be true to the faith.
They warned them that to enter theActs 14.23–15.2
69
kingdom of God we must undergo many
hardships.
23 They also appointed for them elders
in each congregation, and with prayer
and fasting committed them to the Lord
in whom they had put their trust.
24 They passed through Pisidia and
came into Pamphylia.
25 When they had delivered the message
at Perga, they went down to Attalia,
26 and from there sailed to Antioch,
where they had originally been
commended to the grace of God for the
task which they had now completed.
27 On arrival there, they called the
congregation together and reported all
that God had accomplished through
them, and how he had thrown open the
gates of faith to the Gentiles.
28 And they stayed for some time with
the disciples there.
1 SOME people who had come
down from Judaea began to teach
the brotherhood that those who were not
circumcised in accordance with Mosaic
practice could not be saved.
2 That brought them into fierce
dissension and controversy with Paul
15Acts 15.3–7
70
and Barnabas, and it was arranged that
these two and some others from Antioch
should go up to Jerusalem to see the
apostles and elders about this question.
3 They were sent on their way by the
church, and travelled through Phoenicia
and Samaria, telling the full story of the
conversion of the Gentiles, and causing
great rejoicing among all the Christians.
4 When they reached Jerusalem they
were welcomed by the church and the
apostles and elders, and they reported
all that God had accomplished through
them.
5 But some of the Pharisaic party who
had become believers came forward
and declared, Those Gentiles must be
circumcised and told to keep the law of
Moses.
6 The apostles and elders met to look
into this matter,
7 and, after a long debate, Peter rose
to address them. My friends, he said, in
the early days, as you yourselves know,
God made his choice among you: from
my lips the Gentiles were to hear and
believe the message of the gospel.Acts 15.8–15
71
8 And God, who can read human hearts,
showed his approval by giving the Holy
Spirit to them as he did to us.
9 He made no difference between them
and us; for he purified their hearts by
faith.
10 Then why do you now try God's
patience by laying on the shoulders of
these converts a yoke which neither we
nor our forefathers were able to bear?
11 For our belief is that we are saved in
the same way as they are: by the grace
of the Lord Jesus.
12 At that the whole company fell silent
and listened to Barnabas and Paul as
they described all the signs and portents
that God had worked among the Gentiles
through them.
13 When they had finished speaking,
James summed up: My friends, he said,
listen to me.
14 Simon has described how it first
happened that God, in his providence,
chose from among the Gentiles a people
to bear his name.
15 This agrees with the words of the
prophets: as scripture has it,Acts 15.16–22
72
16 Thereafter I will return and rebuild
the fallen house of David; I will rebuild
its ruins and set it up again,
17 that the rest of mankind may seek
the Lord, all the Gentiles whom I have
claimed for my own. Thus says the Lord,
who is doing this
18 as he made known long ago.
19 In my judgement, therefore, we
should impose no irksome restrictions on
those of the Gentiles who are turning to
God;
20 instead we should instruct them by
letter to abstain from things polluted by
contact with idols, from fornication, from
anything that has been strangled, and
from blood.
21 Moses, after all, has never lacked
spokesmen in every town for generations
past; he is read in the synagogues
sabbath by sabbath.
22 Then, with the agreement of the
whole church, the apostles and elders
resolved to choose representatives and
send them to Antioch with Paul and
Barnabas. They chose two leading men
in the community, Judas Barsabbas and
Silas,Acts 15.23–30
73
23 and gave them this letter to deliver:
From the apostles and elders to our
brothers of gentile origin in Antioch,
Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings!
24 We have heard that some of our
number, without any instructions from
us, have disturbed you with their talk
and unsettled your minds.
25 In consequence, we have resolved
unanimously to send to you our chosen
representatives with our well-beloved
Barnabas and Paul,
26 who have given up their lives to the
cause of our Lord Jesus Christ;
27 so we are sending Judas and Silas,
who will, by word of mouth, confirm
what is written in this letter.
28 It is the decision of the Holy Spirit,
and our decision, to lay no further burden
upon you beyond these essentials:
29 you are to abstain from meat that has
been offered to idols, from blood, from
anything that has been strangled, and
from fornication. If you keep yourselves
free from these things you will be doing
well. Farewell.
30 So they took their leave and travelled
down to Antioch, where they called theActs 15.31–38
74
congregation together and delivered the
letter.
31 When it was read, all rejoiced at the
encouragement it brought,
32 and Judas and Silas, who were
themselves prophets, said much to
encourage and strengthen the members.
33 After spending some time there, they
took their leave with the good wishes of
the brethren, to return to those who had
sent them.
34 [[EMPTY]]
35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed on at
Antioch, where, along with many others,
they taught and preached the word of
the Lord.
36 AFTER a while Paul said to Barnabas,
Let us go back and see how our brothers
are getting on in the various towns
where we proclaimed the word of the
Lord.
37 Barnabas wanted to take John Mark
with them;
38 but Paul insisted that the man who
had deserted them in Pamphylia and had
not gone on to share in their work was
not the man to take with them now.Acts 15.39–16.6
75
39 The dispute was so sharp that they
parted company. Barnabas took Mark
with him and sailed for Cyprus.
40 Paul chose Silas and started on his
journey, commended by the brothers to
the grace of the Lord.
41 He travelled through Syria and Cilicia
bringing new strength to the churches.
1 He went on to Derbe and then to
Lystra, where he found a disciple
named Timothy, the son of a Jewish
Christian mother and a gentile father,
2 well spoken of by the Christians at
Lystra and Iconium.
3 Paul wanted to take him with him
when he left, so he had him circumcised
out of consideration for the Jews who
lived in those parts, for they all knew
that his father was a Gentile.
4 As they made their way from town to
town they handed on the decisions taken
by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem
and enjoined their observance.
5 So, day by day, the churches grew
stronger in faith and increased in
numbers.
6 They travelled through the Phrygian
and Galatian region, prevented by the
16Acts 16.7–13
76
Holy Spirit from delivering the message
in the province of Asia.
7 When they approached the Mysian
border they tried to enter Bithynia, but,
as the Spirit of Jesus would not allow
them,
8 they passed through Mysia and
reached the coast at Troas.
9 During the night a vision came to Paul:
a Macedonian stood there appealing to
him, Cross over to Macedonia and help
us.
10 As soon as he had seen this vision,
we set about getting a passage to
Macedonia, convinced that God had
called us to take the good news there.
11 We sailed from Troas and made a
straight run to Samothrace, the next day
to Neapolis,
12 and from there to Philippi, a leading
city in that district of Macedonia and a
Roman colony. Here we stayed for some
days,
13 and on the sabbath we went outside
the city gate by the riverside, where
we thought there would be a place of
prayer; we sat down and talked to the
women who had gathered there.Acts 16.14–19
77
14 One of those listening was called
Lydia, a dealer in purple fabric, who
came from the city of Thyatira; she was a
worshipper of God, and the Lord opened
her heart to respond to what Paul said.
15 She was baptized, and her household
with her, and then she urged us, Now
that you have accepted me as a believer
in the Lord, come and stay at my house.
And she insisted on our going.
16 Once, on our way to the place of
prayer, we met a slave-girl who was
possessed by a spirit of divination and
brought large profits to her owners by
telling fortunes.
17 She followed Paul and the rest of us,
shouting, These men are servants of the
Most High God, and are declaring to you
a way of salvation.
18 She did this day after day, until, in
exasperation, Paul rounded on the spirit.
I command you in the name of Jesus
Christ to come out of her, he said, and it
came out instantly.
19 When the girl's owners saw that their
hope of profit had gone, they seized Paul
and Silas and dragged them to the city
authorities in the main square;Acts 16.20–27
78
20 bringing them before the magistrates,
they alleged, These men are causing a
disturbance in our city; they are Jews,
21 and they are advocating practices
which it is illegal for us Romans to adopt
and follow.
22 The mob joined in the attack; and the
magistrates had the prisoners stripped
and gave orders for them to be flogged.
23 After a severe beating they were
flung into prison and the jailer was
ordered to keep them under close guard.
24 In view of these orders, he put them
into the inner prison and secured their
feet in the stocks.
25 About midnight Paul and Silas, at
their prayers, were singing praises
to God, and the other prisoners were
listening,
26 when suddenly there was such a
violent earthquake that the foundations
of the jail were shaken; the doors burst
open and all the prisoners found their
fetters unfastened.
27 The jailer woke up to see the prison
doors wide open and, assuming that the
prisoners had escaped, drew his sword
intending to kill himself.Acts 16.28–36
79
28 But Paul shouted, Do yourself no
harm; we are all here.
29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in,
and threw himself down before Paul and
Silas, trembling with fear.
30 He then escorted them out and said,
Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
31 They answered, Put your trust in the
Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you
and your household,
32 and they imparted the word of the
Lord to him and to everyone in his house.
33 At that late hour of the night the jailer
took them and washed their wounds,
and there and then he and his whole
family were baptized.
34 He brought them up into his house,
set out a meal, and rejoiced with his
whole household in his new-found faith
in God.
35 When daylight came, the magistrates
sent their officers with the order, Release
those men.
36 The jailer reported these instructions
to Paul: The magistrates have sent an
order for your release. Now you are free
to go in peace.Acts 16.37–17.3
80
37 But Paul said to the officers: We are
Roman citizens! They gave us a public
flogging and threw us into prison without
trial. Are they now going to smuggle
us out by stealth? No indeed! Let them
come in person and escort us out.
38 The officers reported his words to the
magistrates. Alarmed to hear that they
were Roman citizens,
39 they came and apologized to them,
and then escorted them out and
requested them to go away from the city.
40 On leaving the prison, they went
to Lydia's house, where they met their
fellow-Christians and spoke words of
encouragement to them, and then they
took their departure.
1 THEY now travelled by way of
Amphipolis and Apollonia and
came to Thessalonica, where there was
a Jewish synagogue.
2 Following his usual practice Paul went
to their meetings; and for the next three
sabbaths he argued with them, quoting
texts of scripture
3 which he expounded and applied to
show that the Messiah had to suffer and
rise from the dead. And this Jesus, he
17Acts 17.4–10
81
said, whom I am proclaiming to you is
the Messiah.
4 Some of them were convinced and
joined Paul and Silas, as did a great
number of godfearing Gentiles and a
good many influential women.
5 The Jews in their jealousy recruited
some ruffians from the dregs of society
to gather a mob. They put the city in an
uproar, and made for Jason's house with
the intention of bringing Paul and Silas
before the town assembly.
6 Failing to find them, they dragged
Jason himself and some members of the
congregation before the magistrates,
shouting, The men who have made
trouble the whole world over have now
come here,
7 and Jason has harboured them. All
of them flout the emperor's laws, and
assert there is a rival king, Jesus.
8 These words alarmed the mob and the
magistrates also,
9 who took security from Jason and the
others before letting them go.
10 As soon as darkness fell, the
members of the congregation sent PaulActs 17.11–16
82
and Silas off to Beroea; and, on arrival,
they made their way to the synagogue.
11 The Jews here were more fair-
minded than those at Thessalonica:
they received the message with great
eagerness, studying the scriptures every
day to see whether it was true.
12 Many of them therefore became
believers, and so did a fair number of
Gentiles, women of standing as well as
men.
13 But when the Thessalonian Jews
learnt that the word of God had now
been proclaimed by Paul in Beroea, they
followed him there to stir up trouble and
rouse the rabble.
14 At once the members of the
congregation sent Paul down to the
coast, while Silas and Timothy both
stayed behind.
15 Paul's escort brought him as far as
Athens, and came away with instructions
for Silas and Timothy to rejoin him with
all speed.
16 While Paul was waiting for them at
Athens, he was outraged to see the city
so full of idols.Acts 17.17–22
83
17 He argued in the synagogue with the
Jews and gentile worshippers, and also
in the city square every day with casual
passers-by.
18 Moreover, some of the Epicurean
and Stoic philosophers joined issue with
him. Some said, What can this charlatan
be trying to say? and others, He would
appear to be a propagandist for foreign
deities -- this because he was preaching
about Jesus and the Resurrection.
19 They brought him to the Council
of the Areopagus and asked, May we
know what this new doctrine is that you
propound?
20 You are introducing ideas that sound
strange to us, and we should like to
know what they mean.
21 Now, all the Athenians and the
resident foreigners had time for nothing
except talking or hearing about the latest
novelty.
22 Paul stood up before the Council
of the Areopagus and began: Men of
Athens, I see that in everything that
concerns religion you are uncommonly
scrupulous.Acts 17.23–29
84
23 As I was going round looking at
the objects of your worship, I noticed
among other things an altar bearing the
inscription To an Unknown God. What
you worship but do not know -- this is
what I now proclaim.
24 The God who created the world
and everything in it, and who is Lord
of heaven and earth, does not live in
shrines made by human hands.
25 It is not because he lacks anything
that he accepts service at our hands, for
he is himself the universal giver of life
and breath -- indeed of everything.
26 He created from one stock every
nation of men to inhabit the whole
earth's surface. He determined their eras
in history and the limits of their territory.
27 They were to seek God in the hope
that, groping after him, they might find
him; though indeed he is not far from
each one of us,
28 for in him we live and move, in him
we exist; as some of your own poets
have said, We are also his offspring.
29 Being God's offspring, then, we ought
not to suppose that the deity is like anActs 17.30–18.2
85
image in gold or silver or stone, shaped
by human craftsmanship and design.
30 God has overlooked the age of
ignorance; but now he commands men
and women everywhere to repent,
31 because he has fixed the day on
which he will have the world judged,
and justly judged, by a man whom he
has designated; of this he has given
assurance to all by raising him from the
dead.
32 When they heard about the raising of
the dead, some scoffed; others said, We
will hear you on this subject some other
time.
33 So Paul left the assembly.
34 Some men joined him and became
believers, including Dionysius, a member
of the Council of the Areopagus; and also
a woman named Damaris, with others
besides.
1 After this he left Athens and
went to Corinth.
2 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a
native of Pontus, and his wife Priscilla;
they had recently arrived from Italy
because Claudius had issued an edict
18Acts 18.3–8
86
that all Jews should leave Rome. Paul
approached them
3 and, because he was of the same
trade, he made his home with them;
they were tentmakers and Paul worked
with them.
4 He also held discussions in the
synagogue sabbath by sabbath, trying to
convince both Jews and Gentiles.
5 Then Silas and Timothy came
down from Macedonia, and Paul
devoted himself entirely to preaching,
maintaining before the Jews that the
Messiah is Jesus.
6 When, however, they opposed him and
resorted to abuse, he shook out the folds
of his cloak and declared, Your blood
be on your own heads! My conscience
is clear! From now on I shall go to the
Gentiles.
7 With that he left, and went to the
house of a worshipper of God named
Titius Justus, who lived next door to the
synagogue.
8 Crispus, the president of the
synagogue, became a believer in the
Lord, as did all his household; and aActs 18.9–15
87
number of Corinthians who heard him
believed and were baptized.
9 One night in a vision the Lord said
to Paul, Have no fear: go on with your
preaching and do not be silenced.
10 I am with you, and no attack shall
harm you, for I have many in this city
who are my people.
11 So he settled there for eighteen
months, teaching the word of God
among them.
12 But when Gallio was proconsul of
Achaia, the Jews made a concerted
attack on Paul and brought him before
the court.
13 This man, they said, is inducing
people to worship God in ways that are
against the law.
14 Paul was just about to speak when
Gallio declared, If it had been a question
of crime or grave misdemeanour, I
should, of course, have given you Jews a
patient hearing,
15 but if it is some bickering about
words and names and your Jewish law,
you may settle it yourselves. I do not
intend to be a judge of these matters.Acts 18.16–23
88
16 And he dismissed them from the
court.
17 Then they all attacked Sosthenes, the
president of the synagogue, and beat
him up in full view of the tribunal. But all
this left Gallio quite unconcerned.
18 Paul stayed on at Corinth for some
time, and then took leave of the
congregation. Accompanied by Priscilla
and Aquila, he sailed for Syria, having
had his hair cut off at Cenchreae in
fulfilment of a vow.
19 They put in at Ephesus, where he
parted from his companions; he himself
went into the synagogue and held a
discussion with the Jews.
20 He was asked to stay longer, but he
declined
21 and set sail from Ephesus, promising,
as he took leave of them, I shall come
back to you if it is God's will.
22 On landing at Caesarea, he went up
and greeted the church; and then went
down to Antioch.
23 After some time there he set out
again on a journey through the Galatian
country and then through Phrygia,
bringing new strength to all the disciples.Acts 18.24–19.1
89
24 THERE arrived at Ephesus a Jew
named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth,
an eloquent man, powerful in his use of
the scriptures.
25 He had been instructed in the way
of the Lord and was full of spiritual
fervour; and in his discourses he taught
accurately the facts about Jesus, though
the only baptism he knew was John's.
26 He now began to speak boldly in the
synagogue, where Priscilla and Aquila
heard him; they took him in hand and
expounded the way to him in greater
detail.
27 Finding that he wanted to go across
to Achaia, the congregation gave him
their support, and wrote to the disciples
there to make him welcome. From the
time of his arrival, he was very helpful to
those who had by God's grace become
believers,
28 for he strenuously confuted the
Jews, demonstrating publicly from the
scriptures that the Messiah is Jesus.
1 While Apollos was at Corinth,
Paul travelled through the inland
regions till he came to Ephesus, where
he found a number of disciples.
19Acts 19.2–9
90
2 When he asked them, Did you receive
the Holy Spirit when you became
believers? they replied, No, we were not
even told that there is a Holy Spirit.
3 He asked, Then what baptism
were you given? John's baptism, they
answered.
4 Paul said, The baptism that John gave
was a baptism in token of repentance,
and he told the people to put their trust
in one who was to come after him, that
is, in Jesus.
5 On hearing this they were baptized
into the name of the Lord Jesus;
6 and when Paul had laid his hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came upon them
and they spoke in tongues of ecstasy
and prophesied.
7 There were about a dozen men in all.
8 During the next three months he
attended the synagogue and with
persuasive argument spoke boldly about
the kingdom of God.
9 When some proved obdurate and
would not believe, speaking evil of
the new way before the congregation,
he withdrew from them, taking the
disciples with him, and continued to holdActs 19.10–16
91
discussions daily in the lecture hall of
Tyrannus.
10 This went on for two years, with the
result that the whole population of the
province of Asia, both Jews and Gentiles,
heard the word of the Lord.
11 God worked extraordinary miracles
through Paul:
12 when handkerchiefs and scarves
which had been in contact with his skin
were carried to the sick, they were cured
of their diseases, and the evil spirits
came out of them.
13 Some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried
their hand at using the name of the Lord
Jesus on those possessed by evil spirits;
they would say, I adjure you by Jesus
whom Paul proclaims.
14 There were seven sons of Sceva, a
Jewish chief priest, who were doing this,
15 when the evil spirit responded, Jesus
I recognize, Paul I know, but who are
you?
16 The man with the evil spirit flew
at them, overpowered them all, and
handled them with such violence that
they ran out of the house battered and
naked.Acts 19.17–23
92
17 Everybody in Ephesus, Jew and
Gentile alike, got to know of it, and all
were awestruck, while the name of the
Lord Jesus gained in honour.
18 Moreover many of those who had
become believers came and openly
confessed that they had been using
magical spells.
19 A good many of those who formerly
practised magic collected their books
and burnt them publicly, and when the
total value was reckoned up it came to
fifty thousand pieces of silver.
20 In such ways the word of the Lord
showed its power, spreading more and
more widely and effectively.
21 When matters had reached this
stage, Paul made up his mind to visit
Macedonia and Achaia and then go on to
Jerusalem. After I have been there, he
said, I must see Rome also.
22 He sent two of his assistants, Timothy
and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he
himself stayed some time longer in the
province of Asia.
23 It was about this time that the
Christian movement gave rise to a
serious disturbance.Acts 19.24–29
93
24 There was a man named Demetrius,
a silversmith who made silver shrines
of Artemis, and provided considerable
employment for the craftsmen.
25 He called a meeting of them and
of the workers in allied trades, and
addressed them: As you men know, our
prosperity depends on this industry.
26 But this fellow Paul, as you can see
and hear for yourselves, has perverted
crowds of people with his propaganda,
not only at Ephesus but also in practically
the whole of the province of Asia; he
tells them that gods made by human
hands are not gods at all.
27 There is danger for us here; it is not
only that our line of business will be
discredited, but also that the sanctuary
of the great goddess Artemis will cease
to command respect; and then it will not
be long before she who is worshipped by
all Asia and the civilized world is brought
down from her divine pre-eminence.
28 On hearing this, they were enraged,
and began to shout, Great is Artemis of
the Ephesians!
29 The whole city was in an uproar; they
made a concerted rush into the theatre,Acts 19.30–35
94
hustling along with them Paul's travelling
companions, the Macedonians Gaius and
Aristarchus.
30 Paul wanted to appear before the
assembly but the other Christians would
not let him.
31 Even some of the dignitaries of the
province, who were friendly towards
him, sent a message urging him not to
venture into the theatre.
32 Meanwhile some were shouting one
thing, some another, for the assembly
was in an uproar and most of them did
not know what they had all come for.
33 Some of the crowd explained the
trouble to Alexander, whom the Jews had
pushed to the front, and he, motioning
for silence, attempted to make a defence
before the assembly.
34 But when they recognized that he
was a Jew, one shout arose from them
all: Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
and they kept it up for about two hours.
35 The town clerk, however, quietened
the crowd. Citizens of Ephesus, he said,
all the world knows that our city of
Ephesus is temple warden of the greatActs 19.36–20.1
95
Artemis and of that image of her which
fell from heaven.
36 Since these facts are beyond dispute,
your proper course is to keep calm and
do nothing rash.
37 These men whom you have brought
here as offenders have committed no
sacrilege and uttered no blasphemy
against our goddess.
38 If, therefore, Demetrius and his
craftsmen have a case against anyone,
there are assizes and there are
proconsuls; let the parties bring their
charges and countercharges.
39 But if it is a larger question you
are raising, it will be dealt with in the
statutory assembly.
40 We certainly run the risk of being
charged with riot for this day's work.
There is no justification for it, and it
would be impossible for us to give any
explanation of this turmoil.
41 With that he dismissed the assembly.
1 WHEN the disturbance was over,
Paul sent for the disciples and,
after encouraging them, said goodbye
and set out on his journey to Macedonia.
20Acts 20.2–9
96
2 He travelled through that region,
constantly giving encouragement to the
Christians, and finally reached Greece.
3 When he had spent three months
there and was on the point of embarking
for Syria, a plot was laid against him by
the Jews, so he decided to return by way
of Macedonia.
4 He was accompanied by Sopater son
of Pyrrhus from Beroea, Aristarchus
and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius
of Derbe, and Timothy, and from Asia
Tychicus and Trophimus.
5 These went ahead and waited for us
at Troas;
6 we ourselves sailed from Philippi after
the Passover season, and five days later
rejoined them at Troas, where we spent
a week.
7 On the Saturday night, when we
gathered for the breaking of bread, Paul,
who was to leave next day, addressed
the congregation and went on speaking
until midnight.
8 Now there were many lamps in the
upstairs room where we were assembled,
9 and a young man named Eutychus,
who was sitting on the window-ledge,Acts 20.10–16
97
grew more and more drowsy as Paul
went on talking, until, completely
overcome by sleep, he fell from the third
storey to the ground, and was picked up
dead.
10 Paul went down, threw himself upon
him, and clasped him in his arms. Do not
distress yourselves, he said to them; he
is alive.
11 He then went upstairs, broke bread
and ate, and after much conversation,
which lasted until dawn, he departed.
12 And they took the boy home, greatly
relieved that he was alive.
13 We went on ahead to the ship and
embarked for Assos, where we were
to take Paul aboard; this was the
arrangement he had made, since he was
going to travel by road.
14 When he met us at Assos, we took
him aboard and proceeded to Mitylene.
15 We sailed from there and next day
arrived off Chios. On the second day we
made Samos, and the following day we
reached Miletus.
16 Paul had decided to bypass Ephesus
and so avoid having to spend time in the
province of Asia; he was eager to be inActs 20.17–24
98
Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, if
that were possible.
17 He did, however, send from Miletus
to Ephesus and summon the elders of
the church.
18 When they joined him, he spoke to
them as follows. You know how, from the
day that I first set foot in the province of
Asia, I spent my whole time with you,
19 serving the Lord in all humility amid
the sorrows and trials that came upon
me through the intrigues of the Jews.
20 You know that I kept back nothing
that was for your good: I delivered the
message to you, and taught you, in
public and in your homes;
21 with Jews and Gentiles alike I insisted
on repentance before God and faith in
our Lord Jesus.
22 Now, as you see, I am constrained by
the Spirit to go to Jerusalem. I do not
know what will befall me there,
23 except that in city after city the Holy
Spirit assures me that imprisonment and
hardships await me.
24 For myself, I set no store by life; all I
want is to finish the race, and complete
the task which the Lord Jesus assignedActs 20.25–32
99
to me, that of bearing my testimony to
the gospel of God's grace.
25 One thing more: I have gone about
among you proclaiming the kingdom,
but now I know that none of you will
ever see my face again.
26 That being so, I here and now declare
that no one's fate can be laid at my
door; I have kept back nothing;
27 I have disclosed to you the whole
purpose of God.
28 Keep guard over yourselves and over
all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has
given you charge, as shepherds of the
church of the Lord, which he won for
himself by his own blood.
29 I know that when I am gone, savage
wolves will come in among you and will
not spare the flock.
30 Even from your own number men will
arise who will distort the truth in order
to get the disciples to break away and
follow them.
31 So be on the alert; remember how
with tears I never ceased to warn each
one of you night and day for three years.
32 And now I commend you to God
and to the word of his grace, which hasActs 20.33–21.1
100
power to build you up and give you your
heritage among all those whom God has
made his own.
33 I have not wanted anyone's money
or clothes for myself;
34 you all know that these hands of
mine earned enough for the needs of
myself and my companions.
35 All along I showed you that it is our
duty to help the weak in this way, by
hard work, and that we should keep in
mind the words of the Lord Jesus, who
himself said, Happiness lies more in
giving than in receiving.
36 As he finished speaking, he knelt
down with them all and prayed.
37 There were loud cries of sorrow from
them all, as they folded Paul in their
arms and kissed him;
38 what distressed them most was his
saying that they would never see his
face again. Then they escorted him to
the ship.
1 We tore ourselves away from
them and, putting to sea, made a
straight run and came to Cos; next day
to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.
21Acts 21.2–8
101
2 There we found a ship bound for
Phoenicia, so we went aboard and sailed
in her.
3 We came in sight of Cyprus and,
leaving it to port, we continued our
voyage to Syria and put in at Tyre, where
the ship was to unload her cargo.
4 We sought out the disciples and stayed
there a week. Warned by the Spirit,
they urged Paul to abandon his visit to
Jerusalem.
5 But when our time ashore was ended,
we left and continued our journey; and
they and their wives and children all
escorted us out of the city. We knelt
down on the beach and prayed,
6 and then bade each other goodbye;
we went on board, and they returned
home.
7 We made the passage from Tyre and
reached Ptolemais, where we greeted
the brotherhood and spent a day with
them.
8 Next day we left and came to
Caesarea, where we went to the home of
Philip the evangelist, who was one of the
Seven, and stayed with him.Acts 21.9–16
102
9 He had four unmarried daughters,
who possessed the gift of prophecy.
10 When we had been there several
days, a prophet named Agabus arrived
from Judaea.
11 He came to us, took Paul's belt,
bound his own feet and hands with it,
and said, These are the words of the Holy
Spirit: Thus will the Jews in Jerusalem
bind the man to whom this belt belongs,
and hand him over to the Gentiles.
12 When we heard this, we and the local
people begged and implored Paul to
abandon his visit to Jerusalem.
13 Then Paul gave his answer: Why
all these tears? Why are you trying to
weaken my resolution? I am ready, not
merely to be bound, but even to die
at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord
Jesus.
14 So, as he would not be dissuaded,
we gave up and said, The Lord's will be
done.
15 At the end of our stay we packed
our baggage and took the road up to
Jerusalem.
16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea
came along with us, to direct us to aActs 21.17–23
103
Cypriot named Mnason, a Christian from
the early days, with whom we were to
spend the night.
17 On our arrival at Jerusalem, the
congregation welcomed us gladly.
18 Next day Paul paid a visit to James;
we accompanied him, and all the elders
were present.
19 After greeting them, he described in
detail all that God had done among the
Gentiles by means of his ministry.
20 When they heard this, they gave
praise to God. Then they said to
Paul: You observe, brother, how many
thousands of converts we have among
the Jews, all of them staunch upholders
of the law.
21 Now they have been given certain
information about you: it is said that you
teach all the Jews in the gentile world to
turn their backs on Moses, and tell them
not to circumcise their children or follow
our way of life.
22 What is to be done, then? They are
sure to hear that you have arrived.
23 Our proposal is this: we have four
men here who are under a vow;Acts 21.24–28
104
24 take them with you and go through
the ritual of purification together, and
pay their expenses, so that they may
have their heads shaved; then everyone
will know that there is nothing in the
reports they have heard about you, but
that you are yourself a practising Jew
and observe the law.
25 As for the gentile converts, we sent
them our decision that they should
abstain from meat that has been offered
to idols, from blood, from anything that
has been strangled, and from fornication.
26 So Paul took the men, and next
day, after going through the ritual of
purification with them, he went into the
temple to give notice of the date when
the period of purification would end and
the offering be made for each of them.
27 BUT just before the seven days were
up, the Jews from the province of Asia
saw him in the temple. They stirred up
all the crowd and seized him,
28 shouting, Help us, men of Israel! This
is the fellow who attacks our people, our
law, and this sanctuary, and spreads his
teaching the whole world over. What isActs 21.29–34
105
more, he has brought Gentiles into the
temple and profaned this holy place.
29 They had previously seen Trophimus
the Ephesian with him in the city, and
assumed that Paul had brought him into
the temple.
30 The whole city was in a turmoil, and
people came running from all directions.
They seized Paul and dragged him out of
the temple, and at once the doors were
shut.
31 They were bent on killing him, but
word came to the officer commanding
the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an
uproar.
32 He immediately took a force of
soldiers with their centurions and came
down at the double to deal with the riot.
When the crowd saw the commandant
and his troops, they stopped beating
Paul.
33 As soon as the commandant could
reach Paul, he arrested him and ordered
him to be shackled with two chains; he
enquired who he was and what he had
been doing.
34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing,
some another, and as the commandantActs 21.35–22.1
106
could not get at the truth because of the
hubbub, he ordered him to be taken to
the barracks.
35 When Paul reached the steps, he
found himself carried up by the soldiers
because of the violence of the mob;
36 for the whole crowd was at their
heels yelling, Kill him!
37 Just before he was taken into the
barracks Paul said to the commandant,
May I have a word with you? The
commandant said, So you speak Greek?
38 Then you are not the Egyptian who
started a revolt some time ago and led a
force of four thousand terrorists out into
the desert?
39 Paul replied, I am a Jew from Tarsus
in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. May
I have your permission to speak to the
people?
40 When this was given, Paul stood on
the steps and raised his hand to call for
the attention of the people. As soon as
quiet was restored, he addressed them
in the Jewish language:
1 Brothers and fathers, give me
a hearing while I put my case to
you.
22Acts 22.2–7
107
2 When they heard him speaking to
them in their own language, they
listened more quietly.
3 I am a true-born Jew, he began, a
native of Tarsus in Cilicia. I was brought
up in this city, and as a pupil of Gamaliel
I was thoroughly trained in every point
of our ancestral law. I have always been
ardent in God's service, as you all are
today.
4 And so I persecuted this movement to
the death, arresting its followers, men
and women alike, and committing them
to prison,
5 as the high priest and the whole
Council of Elders can testify. It was they
who gave me letters to our fellow-Jews
at Damascus, and I was on my way to
make arrests there also and bring the
prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.
6 What happened to me on my journey
was this: when I was nearing Damascus,
about midday, a great light suddenly
flashed from the sky all around me.
7 I fell to the ground, and heard a voice
saying: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute
me?Acts 22.8–15
108
8 I answered, Tell me, Lord, who you
are. I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you
are persecuting, he said.
9 My companions saw the light, but did
not hear the voice that spoke to me.
10 What shall I do, Lord? I asked, and he
replied, Get up, and go on to Damascus;
there you will be told all that you are
appointed to do.
11 As I had been blinded by the brilliance
of that light, my companions led me by
the hand, and so I came to Damascus.
12 There a man called Ananias, a devout
observer of the law and well spoken of
by all the Jews who lived there,
13 came and stood beside me, and said,
Saul, my brother, receive your sight
again! Instantly I recovered my sight
and saw him.
14 He went on: The God of our fathers
appointed you to know his will and to
see the Righteous One and to hear him
speak,
15 because you are to be his witness to
tell the world what you have seen and
heard.Acts 22.16–24
109
16 Do not delay. Be baptized at once
and wash away your sins, calling on his
name.
17 After my return to Jerusalem, as I
was praying in the temple I fell into a
trance
18 and saw him there, speaking to
me. Make haste, he said, and leave
Jerusalem quickly, for they will not
accept your testimony about me.
19 But surely, Lord, I answered, they
know that I imprisoned those who
believe in you and flogged them in every
synagogue;
20 when the blood of Stephen your
witness was shed I stood by, approving,
and I looked after the clothes of those
who killed him.
21 He said to me, Go, for I mean to send
you far away to the Gentiles.
22 Up to this point the crowd had given
him a hearing; but now they began to
shout, Down with the scoundrel! He is
not fit to be alive!
23 And as they were yelling and waving
their cloaks and flinging dust in the air,
24 the commandant ordered him to be
brought into the barracks, and gaveActs 22.25–30
110
instructions that he should be examined
under the lash, to find out what reason
there was for such an outcry against
him.
25 But when they tied him up for the
flogging, Paul said to the centurion who
was standing there, Does the law allow
you to flog a Roman citizen, and an
unconvicted one at that?
26 When the centurion heard this, he
went and reported to the commandant:
What are you about? This man is a
Roman citizen.
27 The commandant came to Paul and
asked, Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?
Yes, said he.
28 The commandant rejoined,
Citizenship cost me a large sum of
money. Paul said, It was mine by birth.
29 Then those who were about to
examine him promptly withdrew; and
the commandant himself was alarmed
when he realized that Paul was a Roman
citizen and that he had put him in irons.
30 THE following day, wishing to be
quite sure what charge the Jews were
bringing against Paul, he released him
and ordered the chief priests and theActs 23.1–6
111
entire Council to assemble. He then
brought Paul down to stand before them.
1 With his eyes steadily fixed
on the Council, Paul said, My
brothers, all my life to this day I have
lived with a perfectly clear conscience
before God.
2 At this the high priest Ananias ordered
his attendants to strike him on the
mouth.
3 Paul retorted, God will strike you, you
whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge
me in accordance with the law; then, in
defiance of the law, you order me to be
struck!
4 The attendants said, Would you insult
God's high priest?
5 Brothers, said Paul, I had no idea he
was high priest; scripture, I know, says:
You shall not abuse the ruler of your
people.
6 Well aware that one section of them
were Sadducees and the other Pharisees,
Paul called out in the Council, My
brothers, I am a Pharisee, a Pharisee
born and bred; and the issue in this trial
is our hope of the resurrection of the
dead.
23Acts 23.7–14
112
7 At these words the Pharisees and
Sadducees fell out among themselves,
and the assembly was divided.
8 (The Sadducees deny that there is any
resurrection or angel or spirit, but the
Pharisees believe in all three.)
9 A great uproar ensued; and some of
the scribes belonging to the Pharisaic
party openly took sides and declared,
We find no fault with this man; perhaps
an angel or spirit has spoken to him.
10 In the mounting dissension, the
commandant was afraid that Paul would
be torn to pieces, so he ordered the
troops to go down, pull him out of the
crowd, and bring him into the barracks.
11 The following night the Lord appeared
to him and said, Keep up your courage!
You have affirmed the truth about me in
Jerusalem, and you must do the same in
Rome.
12 When day broke, the Jews banded
together and took an oath not to eat or
drink until they had killed Paul.
13 There were more than forty in the
conspiracy;
14 they went to the chief priests
and elders and said, We have boundActs 23.15–20
113
ourselves by a solemn oath not to taste
food until we have killed Paul.
15 It is now up to you and the rest of
the Council to apply to the commandant
to have him brought down to you on the
pretext of a closer investigation of his
case; we have arranged to make away
with him before he reaches you.
16 The son of Paul's sister, however,
learnt of the plot and, going to the
barracks, obtained entry, and reported it
to Paul,
17 who called one of the centurions
and said, Take this young man to the
commandant; he has something to
report.
18 The centurion brought him to
the commandant and explained, The
prisoner Paul sent for me and asked me
to bring this young man to you; he has
something to tell you.
19 The commandant took him by the
arm, drew him aside, and asked him,
What is it you have to report?
20 He replied, The Jews have agreed on
a plan: they will request you to bring
Paul down to the Council tomorrow onActs 23.21–27
114
the pretext of obtaining more precise
information about him.
21 Do not listen to them; for a party
more than forty strong are lying in wait
for him, and they have sworn not to eat
or drink until they have done away with
him. They are now ready, waiting only
for your consent.
22 The commandant dismissed the
young man, with orders not to let
anyone know that he had given him this
information.
23 He then summoned two of his
centurions and gave them these orders:
Have two hundred infantry ready to
proceed to Caesarea, together with
seventy cavalrymen and two hundred
light-armed troops; parade them three
hours after sunset,
24 and provide mounts for Paul so that
he may be conducted under safe escort
to Felix the governor.
25 And he wrote a letter to this effect:
26 From Claudius Lysias to His Excellency
the Governor Felix. Greeting.
27 This man was seized by the Jews
and was on the point of being murdered
when I intervened with the troops, and,Acts 23.28–34
115
on discovering that he was a Roman
citizen, I removed him to safety.
28 As I wished to ascertain the ground
of their charge against him, I brought
him down to their Council.
29 I found that their case had to do with
controversial matters of their law, but
there was no charge against him which
merited death or imprisonment.
30 Information, however, has now been
brought to my notice of an attempt to be
made on the man's life, so I am sending
him to you without delay, and have
instructed his accusers to state their
case against him before you.
31 Acting on their orders, the infantry
took custody of Paul and brought him by
night to Antipatris.
32 Next day they returned to their
barracks, leaving the cavalry to escort
him the rest of the way.
33 When the cavalry reached Caesarea,
they delivered the letter to the governor,
and handed Paul over to him.
34 He read the letter, and asked him
what province he was from; and learning
that he was from CiliciaActs 23.35–24.6
116
35 he said, I will hear your case when
your accusers arrive. He ordered him to
be held in custody at his headquarters in
Herod's palace.
1 FIVE days later the high priest
Ananias came down, accompanied
by some of the elders and an advocate
named Tertullus, to lay before the
governor their charge against Paul.
2 When the prisoner was called, Tertullus
opened the case. Your excellency, he said
to Felix, we owe it to you that we enjoy
unbroken peace, and it is due to your
provident care that, in all kinds of ways
and in all sorts of places, improvements
are being made for the good of this
nation. We appreciate this, and are most
grateful to you.
3 (24:2)
4 And now, not to take up too much of
your time, I crave your indulgence for a
brief statement of our case.
5 We have found this man to be a pest,
a fomenter of discord among the Jews all
over the world, a ringleader of the sect
of the Nazarenes.
6 He made an attempt to profane the
temple and we arrested him.
24Acts 24.7–15
117
7 [[EMPTY]]
8 If you examine him yourself you can
ascertain the truth of all the charges we
bring against him.
9 The Jews supported the charge,
alleging that the facts were as he stated.
10 The governor then motioned to Paul
to speak, and he replied as follows:
Knowing as I do that for many years you
have administered justice to this nation,
I make my defence with confidence.
11 As you can ascertain for yourself, it is
not more than twelve days since I went
up to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage.
12 They did not find me in the temple
arguing with anyone or collecting a
crowd, or in the synagogues or anywhere
else in the city;
13 and they cannot make good the
charges they now bring against me.
14 But this much I will admit: I am a
follower of the new way (the sect they
speak of), and it is in that manner that
I worship the God of our fathers; for I
believe all that is written in the law and
the prophets,
15 and in reliance on God I hold the
hope, which my accusers too accept,Acts 24.16–22
118
that there is to be a resurrection of good
and wicked alike.
16 Accordingly I, no less than they,
train myself to keep at all times a clear
conscience before God and man.
17 After an absence of several years
I came to bring charitable gifts to my
nation and to offer sacrifices.
18 I was ritually purified and engaged
in this service when they found me in
the temple; I had no crowd with me,
and there was no disturbance. But some
Jews from the province of Asia were
there,
19 and if they had any charge against
me, it is they who ought to have been in
court to state it.
20 Failing that, it is for these persons
here present to say what crime they
discovered when I was brought before
the Council,
21 apart from this one declaration which
I made as I stood there: The issue in my
trial before you today is the resurrection
of the dead.
22 Then Felix, who was well informed
about the new way, adjourned the
hearing. I will decide your case whenActs 24.23–25.1
119
Lysias the commanding officer comes
down, he said.
23 He gave orders to the centurion to
keep Paul under open arrest and not to
prevent any of his friends from making
themselves useful to him.
24 Some days later Felix came with his
wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, and
sent for Paul. He let him talk to him
about faith in Christ Jesus,
25 but when the discourse turned to
questions of morals, self-control, and
the coming judgement, Felix became
alarmed and exclaimed, Enough for now!
When I find it convenient I will send for
you again.
26 He also had hopes of a bribe from
Paul, so he sent for him frequently and
talked with him.
27 When two years had passed, Felix
was succeeded by Porcius Festus.
Wishing to curry favour with the Jews,
Felix left Paul in custody.
1 THREE days after taking up his
appointment, Festus went up
from Caesarea to Jerusalem,
25Acts 25.2–9
120
2 where the chief priests and the Jewish
leaders laid before him their charge
against Paul.
3 They urged Festus to support them
in their case and have Paul sent to
Jerusalem, for they were plotting to kill
him on the way.
4 Festus, however, replied, Paul is in
safe custody at Caesarea, and I shall be
leaving Jerusalem shortly myself;
5 so let your leading men come down
with me, and if the man is at fault in any
way, let them prosecute him.
6 After spending eight or ten days at
most in Jerusalem, he went down to
Caesarea, and next day he took his seat
in court and ordered Paul to be brought
before him.
7 When he appeared, the Jews who had
come down from Jerusalem stood round
bringing many grave charges, which
they were unable to prove.
8 Paul protested: I have committed
no offence against the Jewish law,
or against the temple, or against the
emperor.
9 Festus, anxious to ingratiate himself
with the Jews, turned to Paul and asked,Acts 25.10–15
121
Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem
and stand trial on these charges before
me there?
10 But Paul said, I am now standing
before the emperor's tribunal; that
is where I ought to be tried. I have
committed no offence against the Jews,
as you very well know.
11 If I am guilty of any capital crime, I
do not ask to escape the death penalty;
if, however, there is no substance in the
charges which these men bring against
me, it is not open to anyone to hand me
over to them. I appeal to Caesar!
12 Then Festus, after conferring with his
advisers, replied, You have appealed to
Caesar: to Caesar you shall go!
13 Some days later King Agrippa
and Bernice arrived at Caesarea on a
courtesy visit to Festus.
14 They spent some time there, and
during their stay Festus raised Paul's
case with the king. There is a man here,
he said, left in custody by Felix;
15 and when I was in Jerusalem the chief
priests and elders of the Jews brought
a charge against him, demanding his
condemnation.Acts 25.16–21
122
16 I replied that it was not Roman
practice to hand a man over before he
had been confronted with his accusers
and given an opportunity of answering
the charge.
17 So when they had come here with
me I lost no time, but took my seat in
court the very next day and ordered the
man to be brought before me.
18 When his accusers rose to speak,
they brought none of the charges I was
expecting;
19 they merely had certain points of
disagreement with him about their
religion, and about someone called
Jesus, a dead man whom Paul alleged to
be alive.
20 Finding myself out of my depth in
such discussions, I asked if he was
willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial
there on these issues.
21 But Paul appealed to be remanded
in custody for his imperial majesty's
decision, and I ordered him to be
detained until I could send him to the
emperor.Acts 25.22–27
123
22 Agrippa said to Festus, I should
rather like to hear the man myself. You
shall hear him tomorrow, he answered.
23 Next day Agrippa and Bernice came
in full state and entered the audience-
chamber accompanied by high-ranking
officers and prominent citizens; and on
the orders of Festus, Paul was brought
in.
24 Then Festus said, King Agrippa, and
all you who are in attendance, you see
this man: the whole body of the Jews
approached me both in Jerusalem and
here, loudly insisting that he had no
right to remain alive.
25 It was clear to me, however, that he
had committed no capital crime, and
when he himself appealed to his imperial
majesty, I decided to send him.
26 As I have nothing definite about him
to put in writing for our sovereign, I
have brought him before you all and
particularly before you, King Agrippa,
so that as a result of this preliminary
enquiry I may have something to report.
27 There is no sense, it seems to me, in
sending on a prisoner without indicating
the charges against him.Acts 26.1–7
124
1 Agrippa said to Paul: You have
26 our permission to give an account
of yourself. Then Paul stretched out his
hand and began his defence.
2 I consider myself fortunate, King
Agrippa, that it is before you I am
to make my defence today on all the
charges brought against me by the Jews,
3 particularly as you are expert in all
our Jewish customs and controversies. I
beg you therefore to give me a patient
hearing.
4 My life from my youth up, a life spent
from the first among my nation and in
Jerusalem, is familiar to all Jews.
5 Indeed they have known me long
enough to testify, if they would, that I
belonged to the strictest group in our
religion: I was a Pharisee.
6 It is the hope based on the promise
God made to our forefathers that has led
to my being on trial today.
7 Our twelve tribes worship with intense
devotion night and day in the hope of
seeing the fulfilment of that promise;
and for this very hope I am accused,
your majesty, and accused by Jews.Acts 26.8–14
125
8 Why should Jews find it incredible that
God should raise the dead?
9 I myself once thought it my duty to
work actively against the name of Jesus
of Nazareth;
10 and I did so in Jerusalem. By
authority obtained from the chief priests,
I sent many of God's people to prison,
and when they were condemned to
death, my vote was cast against them.
11 In all the synagogues I tried by
repeated punishment to make them
commit blasphemy; indeed my fury
rose to such a pitch that I extended my
persecution to foreign cities.
12 On one such occasion I was travelling
to Damascus with authority and
commission from the chief priests;
13 and as I was on my way, your
majesty, at midday I saw a light from the
sky, more brilliant than the sun, shining
all around me and my companions.
14 We all fell to the ground, and I
heard a voice saying to me in the
Jewish language, Saul, Saul, why do you
persecute me? It hurts to kick like this
against the goad.Acts 26.15–21
126
15 I said, Tell me, Lord, who you are,
and the Lord replied, I am Jesus, whom
you are persecuting.
16 But now, get to your feet. I have
appeared to you for a purpose: to
appoint you my servant and witness, to
tell what you have seen and what you
shall yet see of me.
17 I will rescue you from your own
people and from the Gentiles to whom I
am sending you.
18 You are to open their eyes and to
turn them from darkness to light, from
the dominion of Satan to God, so that
they may obtain forgiveness of sins and
a place among those whom God has
made his own through faith in me.
19 So, King Agrippa, I did not disobey
the heavenly vision.
20 I preached first to the inhabitants
of Damascus, and then to Jerusalem
and all the country of Judaea, and to
the Gentiles, calling on them to repent
and turn to God, and to prove their
repentance by their deeds.
21 That is why the Jews seized me in the
temple and tried to do away with me.Acts 26.22–29
127
22 But I have had God's help to this very
day, and here I stand bearing witness
to the great and to the lowly. I assert
nothing beyond what was foretold by the
prophets and by Moses:
23 that the Messiah would suffer and
that, as the first to rise from the dead,
he would announce the dawn both to the
Jewish people and to the Gentiles.
24 While Paul was thus making his
defence, Festus shouted at the top of his
voice, Paul, you are raving; too much
study is driving you mad.
25 I am not mad, your excellency, said
Paul; what I am asserting is sober truth.
26 The king is well versed in these
matters, and I can speak freely to him. I
do not believe that he can be unaware of
any of these facts, for this has been no
hole-and-corner business.
27 King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know you do.
28 Agrippa said to Paul, With a little
more of your persuasion you will make a
Christian of me.
29 Little or much, said Paul, I wish to
God that not only you, but all those whoActs 26.30–27.4
128
are listening to me today, might become
what I am -- apart from these chains!
30 With that the king rose, and with him
the governor, Bernice, and the rest of
the company,
31 and after they had withdrawn they
talked it over. This man, they agreed,
is doing nothing that deserves death or
imprisonment.
32 Agrippa said to Festus, The fellow
could have been discharged, if he had
not appealed to the emperor.
1 WHEN it was decided that we
should sail for Italy, Paul and
some other prisoners were handed over
to a centurion named Julius, of the
Augustan Cohort.
2 We embarked in a ship of
Adramyttium, bound for ports in
the province of Asia, and put out to
sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from
Thessalonica, came with us.
3 Next day we landed at Sidon, and
Julius very considerately allowed Paul to
go to his friends to be cared for.
4 Leaving Sidon we sailed under the lee
of Cyprus because of the head winds,
27Acts 27.5–12
129
5 then across the open sea off the coast
of Cilicia and Pamphylia, and so reached
Myra in Lycia.
6 There the centurion found an
Alexandrian vessel bound for Italy and
put us on board.
7 For a good many days we made little
headway, and we were hard put to it
to reach Cnidus. Then, as the wind
continued against us, off Salmone we
began to sail under the lee of Crete,
8 and, hugging the coast, struggled on
to a place called Fair Havens, not far
from the town of Lasea.
9 By now much time had been lost,
and with the Fast already over, it was
dangerous to go on with the voyage. So
Paul gave them this warning:
10 I can see, gentlemen, that this
voyage will be disastrous; it will mean
heavy loss, not only of ship and cargo
but also of life.
11 But the centurion paid more attention
to the captain and to the owner of the
ship than to what Paul said;
12 and as the harbour was unsuitable
for wintering, the majority were in
favour of putting to sea, hoping, if theyActs 27.13–19
130
could get so far, to winter at Phoenix, a
Cretan harbour facing south-west and
north-west.
13 When a southerly breeze sprang up,
they thought that their purpose was as
good as achieved, and, weighing anchor,
they sailed along the coast of Crete
hugging the land.
14 But before very long a violent wind,
the Northeaster as they call it, swept
down from the landward side.
15 It caught the ship and, as it was
impossible to keep head to wind, we had
to give way and run before it.
16 As we passed under the lee of a small
island called Cauda, we managed with
a struggle to get the ship's boat under
control.
17 When they had hoisted it on board,
they made use of tackle to brace the
ship. Then, afraid of running on to the
sandbanks of Syrtis, they put out a
sea-anchor and let her drift.
18 Next day, as we were making very
heavy weather, they began to lighten the
ship;
19 and on the third day they jettisoned
the ship's gear with their own hands.Acts 27.20–27
131
20 For days on end there was no sign of
either sun or stars, the storm was raging
unabated, and our last hopes of coming
through alive began to fade.
21 When they had gone for a long time
without food, Paul stood up among them
and said, You should have taken my
advice, gentlemen, not to put out from
Crete: then you would have avoided this
damage and loss.
22 But now I urge you not to lose heart;
not a single life will be lost, only the ship.
23 Last night there stood by me an
angel of the God whose I am and whom
I worship.
24 Do not be afraid, Paul, he said;
it is ordained that you shall appear
before Caesar; and, be assured, God
has granted you the lives of all who are
sailing with you.
25 So take heart, men! I trust God: it
will turn out as I have been told;
26 we are to be cast ashore on an island.
27 The fourteenth night came and we
were still drifting in the Adriatic Sea. At
midnight the sailors felt that land was
getting nearer,Acts 27.28–35
132
28 so they took a sounding and found
twenty fathoms. Sounding again after a
short interval they found fifteen fathoms;
29 then, fearing that we might be cast
ashore on a rugged coast, they let go
four anchors from the stern and prayed
for daylight to come.
30 The sailors tried to abandon ship;
they had already lowered the ship's
boat, pretending they were going to lay
out anchors from the bows,
31 when Paul said to the centurion and
the soldiers, Unless these men stay on
board you cannot reach safety.
32 At that the soldiers cut the ropes of
the boat and let it drop away.
33 Shortly before daybreak Paul urged
them all to take some food. For the last
fourteen days, he said, you have lived
in suspense and gone hungry; you have
eaten nothing.
34 So have something to eat, I beg you;
your lives depend on it. Remember, not
a hair of your heads will be lost.
35 With these words, he took bread,
gave thanks to God in front of them all,
broke it, and began eating.Acts 27.36–43
133
36 Then they plucked up courage, and
began to take food themselves.
37 All told there were on board two
hundred and seventy-six of us.
38 After they had eaten as much as
they wanted, they lightened the ship by
dumping the grain into the sea.
39 When day broke, they did not
recognize the land, but they sighted a
bay with a sandy beach, on which they
decided, if possible, to run ashore.
40 So they slipped the anchors and let
them go; at the same time they loosened
the lashings of the steering-paddles, set
the foresail to the wind, and let her drive
to the beach.
41 But they found themselves caught
between cross-currents and ran the ship
aground, so that the bow stuck fast and
remained immovable, while the stern
was being pounded to pieces by the
breakers.
42 The soldiers thought they had better
kill the prisoners for fear that any should
swim away and escape;
43 but the centurion was determined to
bring Paul safely through, and prevented
them from carrying out their plan. HeActs 27.44–28.6
134
gave orders that those who could swim
should jump overboard first and get to
land;
44 the rest were to follow, some on
planks, some on parts of the ship. And
thus it was that all came safely to land.
1 Once we had made our way to
safety, we identified the island as
Malta.
2 The natives treated us with uncommon
kindness: because it had started to rain
and was cold they lit a bonfire and made
us all welcome.
3 Paul had got together an armful of
sticks and put them on the fire, when a
viper, driven out by the heat, fastened
on his hand.
4 The natives, seeing the snake hanging
on to his hand, said to one another, The
man must be a murderer; he may have
escaped from the sea, but divine justice
would not let him live.
5 Paul, however, shook off the snake
into the fire and was none the worse.
6 They still expected him to swell up
or suddenly drop down dead, but after
waiting a long time without seeing
anything out of the way happen to him,
28Acts 28.7–13
135
they changed their minds and said, He is
a god.
7 In that neighbourhood there were
lands belonging to the chief magistrate of
the island, whose name was Publius. He
took us in and entertained us hospitably
for three days.
8 It so happened that this man's father
was in bed suffering from recurrent
bouts of fever and dysentery. Paul visited
him and, after prayer, laid his hands on
him and healed him;
9 whereupon the other sick people on
the island came and were cured.
10 They honoured us with many marks
of respect, and when we were leaving
they put on board the supplies we
needed.
11 Three months had passed when we
put to sea in a ship which had wintered
in the island; she was the Castor and
Pollux of Alexandria.
12 We landed at Syracuse and spent
three days there;
13 then we sailed up the coast and
arrived at Rhegium. Next day a south
wind sprang up and we reached Puteoli
in two days.Acts 28.14–19
136
14 There we found fellow-Christians and
were invited to stay a week with them.
And so to Rome.
15 The Christians there had had news
of us and came out to meet us as far as
Appii Forum and the Three Taverns, and
when Paul saw them, he gave thanks to
God and took courage.
16 WHEN we entered Rome Paul was
allowed to lodge privately, with a soldier
in charge of him.
17 Three days later he called together
the local Jewish leaders, and when they
were assembled, he said to them: My
brothers, I never did anything against
our people or against the customs of
our forefathers; yet I was arrested
in Jerusalem and handed over to the
Romans.
18 They examined me and would have
liked to release me because there was
no capital charge against me;
19 but the Jews objected, and I had no
option but to appeal to Caesar; not that
I had any accusation to bring against my
own people.Acts 28.20–25
137
20 This is why I have asked to see and
talk to you; it is for loyalty to the hope
of Israel that I am in these chains.
21 They replied, We have had no
communication about you from Judaea,
nor has any countryman of ours arrived
with any report or gossip to your
discredit.
22 We should like to hear from you what
your views are; all we know about this
sect is that no one has a good word to
say for it.
23 So they fixed a day, and came in
large numbers to his lodging. From dawn
to dusk he put his case to them; he
spoke urgently of the kingdom of God
and sought to convince them about
Jesus by appealing to the law of Moses
and the prophets.
24 Some were won over by his
arguments; others remained
unconvinced.
25 Without reaching any agreement
among themselves they began to
disperse, but not before Paul had spoken
this final word: How well the Holy
Spirit spoke to your fathers through the
prophet IsaiahActs 28.26–31
138
26 when he said, Go to this people and
say: You may listen and listen, but you
will never understand; you may look and
look, but you will never see.
27 For this people's mind has become
dull; they have stopped their ears and
closed their eyes. Otherwise, their eyes
might see, their ears hear, and their
mind understand, and then they might
turn again, and I would heal them.
28 Therefore take note that this salvation
of God has been sent to the Gentiles;
the Gentiles will listen.
29 [[EMPTY]]
30 He stayed there two full years at his
own expense, with a welcome for all who
came to him;
31 he proclaimed the kingdom of God
and taught the facts about the Lord
Jesus Christ quite openly and without
hindrance.Romans
1 FROM Paul, servant of Christ Jesus,
1 called by God to be an apostle and
set apart for the service of his gospel.
2 This gospel God announced
beforehand in sacred scriptures through
his prophets.
3 It is about his Son: on the human level
he was a descendant of David, but on
the level of the spirit -- the Holy Spirit --
he was proclaimed Son of God by an act
of power that raised him from the dead:
it is about Jesus Christ our Lord.
4 (1:3)
5 Through him I received the privilege of
an apostolic commission to bring people
of all nations to faith and obedience in
his name,
6 including you who have heard the call
and belong to Jesus Christ.
7 I send greetings to all of you in Rome,
who are loved by God and called to
be his people. Grace and peace to you
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.Romans 1.8–15
2
8 Let me begin by thanking my God,
through Jesus Christ, for you all, because
the story of your faith is being told all
over the world.
9 God is my witness, to whom I offer
the service of my spirit by preaching
the gospel of his Son: God knows that
I make mention of you in my prayers
continually,
10 and am always asking that by his will
I may, somehow or other, at long last
succeed in coming to visit you.
11 For I long to see you; I want to bring
you some spiritual gift to make you
strong;
12 or rather, I want us to be encouraged
by one another's faith when I am with
you, I by yours and you by mine.
13 Brothers and sisters, I should like
you to know that I have often planned to
come, though so far without success, in
the hope of achieving something among
you, as I have in the rest of the gentile
world.
14 I have an obligation to Greek and
non-Greek, to learned and simple;
15 hence my eagerness to declare the
gospel to you in Rome as well.Romans 1.16–21
3
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel.
It is the saving power of God for
everyone who has faith -- the Jew first,
but the Greek also --
17 because in it the righteousness of
God is seen at work, beginning in faith
and ending in faith; as scripture says,
Whoever is justified through faith shall
gain life.
18 DIVINE retribution is to be seen at
work, falling from heaven on all the
impiety and wickedness of men and
women who in their wickedness suppress
the truth.
19 For all that can be known of God
lies plain before their eyes; indeed God
himself has disclosed it to them.
20 Ever since the world began his
invisible attributes, that is to say his
everlasting power and deity, have been
visible to the eye of reason, in the things
he has made. Their conduct, therefore,
is indefensible;
21 knowing God, they have refused to
honour him as God, or to render him
thanks. Hence all their thinking has
ended in futility, and their misguided
minds are plunged in darkness.Romans 1.22–28
4
22 They boast of their wisdom, but they
have made fools of themselves,
23 exchanging the glory of the immortal
God for an image shaped like mortal
man, even for images like birds, beasts,
and reptiles.
24 For this reason God has given them
up to their own vile desires, and the
consequent degradation of their bodies.
25 They have exchanged the truth of
God for a lie, and have offered reverence
and worship to created things instead
of to the Creator. Blessed is he for ever,
Amen.
26 As a result God has given them up to
shameful passions. Among them women
have exchanged natural intercourse for
unnatural,
27 and men too, giving up natural
relations with women, burn with lust for
one another; males behave indecently
with males, and are paid in their
own persons the fitting wage of such
perversion.
28 Thus, because they have not seen
fit to acknowledge God, he has given
them up to their own depraved way ofRomans 1.29–2.3
5
thinking, and this leads them to break all
rules of conduct.
29 They are filled with every kind of
wickedness, villainy, greed, and malice;
they are one mass of envy, murder,
rivalry, treachery, and malevolence;
gossips
30 and scandalmongers; and
blasphemers, insolent, arrogant,
and boastful; they invent new kinds of
vice, they show no respect to parents,
31 they are without sense or fidelity,
without natural affection or pity.
32 They know well enough the just
decree of God, that those who behave
like this deserve to die; yet they not only
do these things themselves but approve
such conduct in others.
1 You have no defence, then, whoever
you may be, when you sit in
judgement -- for in judging others you
condemn yourself, since you, the judge,
are equally guilty.
2 We all know that God's judgement on
those who commit such crimes is just;
3 and do you imagine -- you that
pass judgement on the guilty while
committing the same crimes yourself --
2Romans 2.4–11
6
do you imagine that you, any more than
they, will escape the judgement of God?
4 Or do you despise his wealth of
kindness and tolerance and patience,
failing to see that God's kindness is
meant to lead you to repentance?
5 In the obstinate impenitence of your
heart you are laying up for yourself a
store of retribution against the day of
retribution, when God's just judgement
will be revealed,
6 and he will pay everyone for what he
has done.
7 To those who pursue glory, honour,
and immortality by steady persistence in
well-doing, he will give eternal life;
8 but the retribution of his wrath awaits
those who are governed by selfish
ambition, who refuse obedience to truth
and take evil for their guide.
9 There will be affliction and distress for
every human being who is a wrongdoer,
for the Jew first and for the Greek also;
10 but for everyone who does right there
will be glory, honour, and peace, for the
Jew first and also for the Greek.
11 God has no favourites.Romans 2.12–19
7
12 Those who have sinned outside the
pale of the law of Moses will perish
outside the law, and all who have sinned
under that law will be judged by it.
13 None will be justified before God by
hearing the law, but by doing it.
14 When Gentiles who do not possess
the law carry out its precepts by the light
of nature, then, although they have no
law, they are their own law;
15 they show that what the law requires
is inscribed on their hearts, and to
this their conscience gives supporting
witness, since their own thoughts argue
the case, sometimes against them,
sometimes even for them.
16 So it will be on the day when,
according to my gospel, God will judge
the secrets of human hearts through
Christ Jesus.
17 BUT as for you who bear the name of
Jew and rely on the law: you take pride
in your God;
18 you know his will; taught by the law,
you know what really matters;
19 you are confident that you are a
guide to the blind, a light to those in
darkness,Romans 2.20–27
8
20 an instructor of the foolish, and a
teacher of the immature, because you
possess in the law the embodiment of
knowledge and truth.
21 You teach others, then; do you not
teach yourself? You proclaim, Do not
steal; but are you yourself a thief?
22 You say, Do not commit adultery; but
are you an adulterer? You abominate
false gods; but do you rob shrines?
23 While you take pride in the law, you
dishonour God by breaking it.
24 As scripture says, Because of you
the name of God is profaned among the
Gentiles.
25 Circumcision has value, provided you
keep the law; but if you break the law,
then your circumcision is as if it had
never been.
26 Equally, if an uncircumcised man
keeps the precepts of the law, will he not
count as circumcised?
27 He may be physically uncircumcised,
but by fulfilling the law he will pass
judgement on you who break it, for all
your written code and your circumcision.Romans 2.28–3.6
9
28 It is not externals that make a Jew,
nor an external mark in the flesh that
makes circumcision.
29 The real Jew is one who is inwardly
a Jew, and his circumcision is of the
heart, spiritual not literal; he receives his
commendation not from men but from
God.
1 Then what advantage has the Jew?
What is the value of circumcision?
2 Great, in every way. In the first place,
the Jews were entrusted with the oracles
of God.
3 What if some of them were unfaithful?
Will their faithlessness cancel the
faithfulness of God?
4 Certainly not! God must be true
though all men be proved liars; for
we read in scripture, When you speak
you will be vindicated; when you are
accused, you will win the case.
5 Another question: if our injustice
serves to confirm God's justice, what are
we to say? Is it unjust of God (I speak of
him in human terms) to bring retribution
upon us?
6 Certainly not! If God were unjust, how
could he judge the world?
3Romans 3.7–17
10
7 Again, if the truth of God is displayed
to his greater glory through my
falsehood, why should I any longer be
condemned as a sinner?
8 Why not indeed do evil that good may
come, as some slanderously report me
as saying? To condemn such men as
these is surely just.
9 Well then, are we Jews any better off?
No, not at all! For we have already drawn
up the indictment that all, Jews and
Greeks alike, are under the power of sin.
10 Scripture says: There is no one
righteous; no, not one;
11 no one who understands, no one who
seeks God.
12 All have swerved aside, all alike have
become debased; there is no one to
show kindness: no, not one.
13 Their throats are open tombs, they
use their tongues for treachery, adders'
venom is on their lips,
14 and their mouths are full of bitter
curses.
15 Their feet hasten to shed blood,
16 ruin and misery mark their tracks,
17 they are strangers to the path of
peace,Romans 3.18–25
11
18 and reverence for God does not enter
their thoughts.
19 Now all the words of the law are
addressed, as we know, to those who
are under the law, so that no one may
have anything to say in self-defence,
and the whole world may be exposed to
God's judgement.
20 For no human being can be justified
in the sight of God by keeping the law:
law brings only the consciousness of sin.
21 But now, quite independently of law,
though with the law and the prophets
bearing witness to it, the righteousness
of God has been made known;
22 it is effective through faith in Christ
for all who have such faith -- all, without
distinction.
23 For all alike have sinned, and are
deprived of the divine glory;
24 and all are justified by God's free
grace alone, through his act of liberation
in the person of Christ Jesus.
25 For God designed him to be the
means of expiating sin by his death,
effective through faith. God meant by
this to demonstrate his justice, becauseRomans 3.26–4.2
12
in his forbearance he had overlooked the
sins of the past --
26 to demonstrate his justice now in the
present, showing that he is himself just
and also justifies anyone who puts his
faith in Jesus.
27 What room then is left for human
pride? It is excluded. And on what
principle? The keeping of the law would
not exclude it, but faith does.
28 For our argument is that people are
justified by faith quite apart from any
question of keeping the law.
29 Do you suppose God is the God of
the Jews alone? Is he not the God of
Gentiles also? Certainly, of Gentiles also.
30 For if the Lord is indeed one, he will
justify the circumcised by their faith and
the uncircumcised through their faith.
31 Does this mean that we are using
faith to undermine the law? By no
means: we are upholding the law.
1 WHAT, then, are we to say about
Abraham, our ancestor by natural
descent?
2 If Abraham was justified by anything
he did, then he has grounds for pride.
But not in the eyes of God!
4Romans 4.3–10
13
3 For what does scripture say? Abraham
put his faith in God, and that faith was
counted to him as righteousness.
4 Now if someone does a piece of work,
his wages are not counted to be a gift;
they are paid as his due.
5 But if someone without any work to
his credit simply puts his faith in him
who acquits the wrongdoer, then his
faith is indeed counted as righteousness.
6 In the same sense David speaks of
the happiness of the man whom God
counts as righteous, apart from any
good works:
7 Happy are they, he says, whose
lawless deeds are forgiven, whose sins
are blotted out;
8 happy is the man whose sin the Lord
does not count against him.
9 Is this happiness confined to
the circumcised, or is it for the
uncircumcised also? We have just been
saying: Abraham's faith was counted as
righteousness.
10 In what circumstances was it so
counted? Was he circumcised at the
time, or not? He was not yet circumcised,
but uncircumcised;Romans 4.11–16
14
11 he received circumcision later as the
sign and hallmark of that righteousness
which faith had given him while he
was still uncircumcised. It follows that
he is the father of all who have faith
when uncircumcised, and so have
righteousness counted to them;
12 and at the same time he is the father
of the circumcised, provided they are not
merely circumcised, but also follow that
path of faith which our father Abraham
trod while he was still uncircumcised.
13 It was not through law that Abraham
and his descendants were given the
promise that the world should be their
inheritance, but through righteousness
that came from faith.
14 If the heirs are those who hold by the
law, then faith becomes pointless and
the promise goes for nothing;
15 law can bring only retribution, and
where there is no law there can be no
breach of law.
16 The promise was made on the ground
of faith in order that it might be a matter
of sheer grace, and that it might be valid
for all Abraham's descendants, not only
for those who hold by the law, but alsoRomans 4.17–24
15
for those who have Abraham's faith. For
he is the father of us all,
17 as scripture says: I have appointed
you to be father of many nations. In the
presence of God, the God who makes
the dead live and calls into being things
that are not, Abraham had faith.
18 When hope seemed hopeless, his
faith was such that he became father
of many nations, in fulfilment of the
promise, So shall your descendants be.
19 His faith did not weaken when he
considered his own body, which was
as good as dead (for he was about a
hundred years old), and the deadness of
Sarah's womb;
20 no distrust made him doubt God's
promise, but, strong in faith, he gave
glory to God,
21 convinced that what he had promised
he was able to do.
22 And that is why Abraham's faith was
counted to him as righteousness.
23 The words counted to him were
meant to apply not only to Abraham
24 but to us; our faith too is to be
counted, the faith in the God who raised
Jesus our Lord from the dead;Romans 4.25–5.8
16
25 for he was given up to death for
our misdeeds, and raised to life for our
justification.
1 THEREFORE, now that we have
been justified through faith, we are
at peace with God through our Lord
Jesus Christ,
2 who has given us access to that grace
in which we now live; and we exult in
the hope of the divine glory that is to be
ours.
3 More than this: we even exult in our
present sufferings, because we know
that suffering is a source of endurance,
4 endurance of approval, and approval
of hope.
5 Such hope is no fantasy; through the
Holy Spirit he has given us, God's love
has flooded our hearts.
6 It was while we were still helpless
that, at the appointed time, Christ died
for the wicked.
7 Even for a just man one of us would
hardly die, though perhaps for a good
man one might actually brave death;
8 but Christ died for us while we were
yet sinners, and that is God's proof of
his love towards us.
5Romans 5.9–14
17
9 And so, since we have now been
justified by Christ's sacrificial death, we
shall all the more certainly be saved
through him from final retribution.
10 For if, when we were God's enemies,
we were reconciled to him through the
death of his Son, how much more, now
that we have been reconciled, shall we
be saved by his life!
11 But that is not all: we also exult in
God through our Lord Jesus, through
whom we have now been granted
reconciliation.
12 What does this imply? It was through
one man that sin entered the world,
and through sin death, and thus death
pervaded the whole human race,
inasmuch as all have sinned.
13 For sin was already in the world
before there was law; and although in
the absence of law no reckoning is kept
of sin,
14 death held sway from Adam to Moses,
even over those who had not sinned
as Adam did, by disobeying a direct
command -- and Adam foreshadows the
man who was to come.Romans 5.15–19
18
15 But God's act of grace is out of all
proportion to Adam's wrongdoing. For if
the wrongdoing of that one man brought
death upon so many, its effect is vastly
exceeded by the grace of God and the
gift that came to so many by the grace
of the one man, Jesus Christ.
16 And again, the gift of God is not
to be compared in its effect with that
one man's sin; for the judicial action,
following on the one offence, resulted in
a verdict of condemnation, but the act of
grace, following on so many misdeeds,
resulted in a verdict of acquittal.
17 If, by the wrongdoing of one man,
death established its reign through that
one man, much more shall those who in
far greater measure receive grace and
the gift of righteousness live and reign
through the one man, Jesus Christ.
18 It follows, then, that as the result of
one misdeed was condemnation for all
people, so the result of one righteous act
is acquittal and life for all.
19 For as through the disobedience of
one man many were made sinners, so
through the obedience of one man many
will be made righteous.Romans 5.20–6.6
19
20 Law intruded into this process to
multiply law-breaking. But where sin
was multiplied, grace immeasurably
exceeded it,
21 in order that, as sin established
its reign by way of death, so God's
grace might establish its reign in
righteousness, and result in eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 WHAT are we to say, then? Shall we
persist in sin, so that there may be
all the more grace?
2 Certainly not! We died to sin: how can
we live in it any longer?
3 Have you forgotten that when we were
baptized into union with Christ Jesus we
were baptized into his death?
4 By that baptism into his death we
were buried with him, in order that, as
Christ was raised from the dead by the
glorious power of the Father, so also we
might set out on a new life.
5 For if we have become identified
with him in his death, we shall also be
identified with him in his resurrection.
6 We know that our old humanity
has been crucified with Christ, for the
6Romans 6.7–13
20
destruction of the sinful self, so that we
may no longer be slaves to sin,
7 because death cancels the claims of
sin.
8 But if we thus died with Christ, we
believe that we shall also live with him,
9 knowing as we do that Christ, once
raised from the dead, is never to
die again: he is no longer under the
dominion of death.
10 When he died, he died to sin, once
for all, and now that he lives, he lives to
God.
11 In the same way you must regard
yourselves as dead to sin and alive to
God, in union with Christ Jesus.
12 Therefore sin must no longer reign in
your mortal body, exacting obedience to
the body's desires.
13 You must no longer put any part of
it at sin's disposal, as an implement for
doing wrong. Put yourselves instead at
the disposal of God; think of yourselves
as raised from death to life, and yield
your bodies to God as implements for
doing right.Romans 6.14–19
21
14 Sin shall no longer be your master,
for you are no longer under law, but
under grace.
15 What then? Are we to sin, because
we are not under law but under grace?
Of course not!
16 You know well enough that if you
bind yourselves to obey a master, you
are slaves of the master you obey; and
this is true whether the master is sin and
the outcome death, or obedience and
the outcome righteousness.
17 Once you were slaves of sin, but
now, thank God, you have yielded
wholehearted obedience to that pattern
of teaching to which you were made
subject;
18 emancipated from sin, you have
become slaves of righteousness
19 (to use language that suits your
human weakness). As you once yielded
your bodies to the service of impurity
and lawlessness, making for moral
anarchy, so now you must yield them to
the service of righteousness, making for
a holy life.Romans 6.20–7.3
22
20 When you were slaves of sin,
you were free from the control of
righteousness.
21 And what gain did that bring you?
Things that now make you ashamed, for
their end is death.
22 But now, freed from the commands
of sin and bound to the service of God,
you have gains that lead to holiness, and
the end is eternal life.
23 For sin pays a wage, and the wage is
death, but God gives freely, and his gift
is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus
our Lord.
1 YOU must be aware, my friends --
I am sure you have some knowledge
of law -- that a person is subject to the
law only so long as he is alive.
2 For example, a married woman is by
law bound to her husband while he lives;
but if the husband dies, she is released
from the marriage bond.
3 If, therefore, in her husband's lifetime
she gives herself to another man, she
will be held to be an adulteress; but if
the husband dies, she is free of the law
and she does not commit adultery by
giving herself to another man.
7Romans 7.4–9
23
4 So too, my friends, through the body
of Christ you died to the law and were
set free to give yourselves to another, to
him who rose from the dead so that we
may bear fruit for God.
5 While we lived on the level of mere
human nature, the sinful passions
evoked by the law were active in our
bodies, and bore fruit for death.
6 But now, having died to that which
held us bound, we are released from the
law, to serve God in a new way, the way
of the spirit in contrast to the old way of
a written code.
7 What follows? Is the law identical with
sin? Of course not! Yet had it not been
for the law I should never have become
acquainted with sin. For example, I
should never have known what it was to
covet, if the law had not said, You shall
not covet.
8 Through that commandment sin found
its opportunity, and produced in me all
kinds of wrong desires. In the absence
of law, sin is devoid of life.
9 There was a time when, in the absence
of law, I was fully alive; but when theRomans 7.10–16
24
commandment came, sin sprang to life
and I died.
10 The commandment which should
have led to life proved in my experience
to lead to death,
11 because in the commandment sin
found its opportunity to seduce me, and
through the commandment killed me.
12 So then, the law in itself is holy and
the commandment is holy and just and
good.
13 Are we therefore to say that this good
thing caused my death? Of course not!
It was sin that killed me, and thereby
sin exposed its true character: it used
a good thing to bring about my death,
and so, through the commandment, sin
became more sinful than ever.
14 We know that the law is spiritual;
but I am not: I am unspiritual, sold as a
slave to sin.
15 I do not even acknowledge my own
actions as mine, for what I do is not
what I want to do, but what I detest.
16 But if what I do is against my will,
then clearly I agree with the law and
hold it to be admirable.Romans 7.17–24
25
17 This means that it is no longer I who
perform the action, but sin that dwells in
me.
18 For I know that nothing good dwells
in me -- my unspiritual self, I mean --
for though the will to do good is there,
the ability to effect it is not.
19 The good which I want to do, I fail to
do; but what I do is the wrong which is
against my will;
20 and if what I do is against my will,
clearly it is no longer I who am the
agent, but sin that has its dwelling in
me.
21 I discover this principle, then: that
when I want to do right, only wrong is
within my reach.
22 In my inmost self I delight in the law
of God,
23 but I perceive in my outward actions
a different law, fighting against the law
that my mind approves, and making me
a prisoner under the law of sin which
controls my conduct.
24 Wretched creature that I am, who
is there to rescue me from this state of
death?Romans 7.25–8.6
26
25 Who but God? Thanks be to him
through Jesus Christ our Lord! To sum
up then: left to myself I serve God's law
with my mind, but with my unspiritual
nature I serve the law of sin.
1 IT follows that there is now no
condemnation for those who are
united with Christ Jesus.
2 In Christ Jesus the life-giving law of
the Spirit has set you free from the law
of sin and death.
3 What the law could not do, because
human weakness robbed it of all potency,
God has done: by sending his own Son
in the likeness of our sinful nature and to
deal with sin, he has passed judgement
against sin within that very nature,
4 so that the commandment of the law
may find fulfilment in us, whose conduct
is no longer controlled by the old nature,
but by the Spirit.
5 Those who live on the level of the old
nature have their outlook formed by it,
and that spells death; but those who
live on the level of the spirit have the
spiritual outlook, and that is life and
peace.
6 (8:5)
8Romans 8.7–13
27
7 For the outlook of the unspiritual
nature is enmity with God; it is not
subject to the law of God and indeed it
cannot be;
8 those who live under its control cannot
please God.
9 But you do not live like that. You live
by the spirit, since God's Spirit dwells in
you; and anyone who does not possess
the Spirit of Christ does not belong to
Christ.
10 But if Christ is in you, then although
the body is dead because of sin, yet the
Spirit is your life because you have been
justified.
11 Moreover, if the Spirit of him who
raised Jesus from the dead dwells in
you, then the God who raised Christ
Jesus from the dead will also give new
life to your mortal bodies through his
indwelling Spirit.
12 It follows, my friends, that our old
nature has no claim on us; we are not
obliged to live in that way.
13 If you do so, you must die. But if
by the Spirit you put to death the base
pursuits of the body, then you will live.Romans 8.14–21
28
14 For all who are led by the Spirit of
God are sons of God.
15 The Spirit you have received is not a
spirit of slavery, leading you back into
a life of fear, but a Spirit of adoption,
enabling us to cry Abba! Father!
16 The Spirit of God affirms to our spirit
that we are God's children;
17 and if children, then heirs, heirs of
God and fellow-heirs with Christ; but we
must share his sufferings if we are also
to share his glory.
18 For I reckon that the sufferings we
now endure bear no comparison with
the glory, as yet unrevealed, which is in
store for us.
19 The created universe is waiting with
eager expectation for God's sons to be
revealed.
20 It was made subject to frustration,
not of its own choice but by the will of
him who subjected it, yet with the hope
21 that the universe itself is to be freed
from the shackles of mortality and is to
enter upon the glorious liberty of the
children of God.Romans 8.22–28
29
22 Up to the present, as we know, the
whole created universe in all its parts
groans as if in the pangs of childbirth.
23 What is more, we also, to whom the
Spirit is given as the firstfruits of the
harvest to come, are groaning inwardly
while we look forward eagerly to our
adoption, our liberation from mortality.
24 It was with this hope that we were
saved. Now to see something is no
longer to hope: why hope for what is
already seen?
25 But if we hope for something we do
not yet see, then we look forward to it
eagerly and with patience.
26 In the same way the Spirit comes to
the aid of our weakness. We do not even
know how we ought to pray, but through
our inarticulate groans the Spirit himself
is pleading for us,
27 and God who searches our inmost
being knows what the Spirit means,
because he pleads for God's people as
God himself wills;
28 and in everything, as we know, he
co-operates for good with those who
love God and are called according to his
purpose.Romans 8.29–36
30
29 For those whom God knew before
ever they were, he also ordained to
share the likeness of his Son, so that he
might be the eldest among a large family
of brothers;
30 and those whom he foreordained, he
also called, and those whom he called
he also justified, and those whom he
justified he also glorified.
31 With all this in mind, what are we to
say? If God is on our side, who is against
us?
32 He did not spare his own Son, but
gave him up for us all; how can he fail to
lavish every other gift upon us?
33 Who will bring a charge against those
whom God has chosen? Not God, who
acquits!
34 Who will pronounce judgement? Not
Christ, who died, or rather rose again;
not Christ, who is at God's right hand
and pleads our cause!
35 Then what can separate us from the
love of Christ? Can affliction or hardship?
Can persecution, hunger, nakedness,
danger, or sword?
36 We are being done to death for your
sake all day long, as scripture says;Romans 8.37–9.4
31
we have been treated like sheep for
slaughter --
37 and yet, throughout it all,
overwhelming victory is ours through
him who loved us.
38 For I am convinced that there is
nothing in death or life, in the realm of
spirits or superhuman powers, in the
world as it is or the world as it shall be,
in the forces of the universe,
39 in heights or depths -- nothing in all
creation that can separate us from the
love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 I AM speaking the truth as
a Christian; my conscience,
enlightened by the Holy Spirit, assures
me that I do not lie when I tell you
2 that there is great grief and unceasing
sorrow in my heart.
3 I would even pray to be an outcast
myself, cut off from Christ, if it would
help my brothers, my kinsfolk by natural
descent.
4 They are descendants of Israel,
chosen to be God's sons; theirs is the
glory of the divine presence, theirs the
covenants, the law, the temple worship,
and the promises.
9Romans 9.5–11
32
5 The patriarchs are theirs, and from
them by natural descent came the
Messiah. May God, supreme above all,
be blessed for ever! Amen.
6 It cannot be that God's word has
proved false. Not all the offspring of
Israel are truly Israel,
7 nor does being Abraham's descendants
make them all his true children; but,
in the words of scripture, It is through
the line of Isaac's descendants that your
name will be traced.
8 That is to say, it is not the children
of Abraham by natural descent who are
children of God; it is the children born
through God's promise who are reckoned
as Abraham's descendants.
9 For the promise runs: In due season I
will come, and Sarah shall have a son.
10 And that is not all: Rebecca's children
had one and the same father, our
ancestor Isaac;
11 yet, even before they were born,
when they as yet had done nothing,
whether good or ill, in order that the
purpose of God, which is a matter of his
choice, might stand firm, based not on
human deeds but on the call of God,Romans 9.12–21
33
12 she was told, The elder shall be
servant to the younger.
13 That accords with the text of
scripture, Jacob I loved and Esau I
hated.
14 What shall we say to that? Is God to
be charged with injustice? Certainly not!
15 He says to Moses, I will show mercy
to whom I will show mercy, and have
pity on whom I will have pity.
16 Thus it does not depend on human
will or effort, but on God's mercy.
17 For in scripture Pharaoh is told, I
have raised you up for this very purpose,
to exhibit my power in my dealings with
you, and to spread my fame over all the
earth.
18 Thus he not only shows mercy as he
chooses, but also makes stubborn as he
chooses.
19 You will say, Then why does God find
fault, if no one can resist his will?
20 Who do you think you are to answer
God back? Can the pot say to the potter,
Why did you make me like this??
21 Surely the potter can do what he likes
with the clay. Is he not free to make twoRomans 9.22–28
34
vessels out of the same lump, one to be
treasured, the other for common use?
22 But if it is indeed God's purpose to
display his retribution and to make his
power known, can it be that he has
with great patience tolerated vessels
that were objects of retribution due for
destruction,
23 precisely in order to make known the
full wealth of his glory on vessels that
were objects of mercy, prepared from
the first for glory?
24 We are those objects of mercy, whom
he has called from among Jews and
Gentiles alike,
25 as he says in Hosea: Those who were
not my people I will call my people, and
the unloved I will call beloved.
26 In the very place where they were
told, You are no people of mine, they
shall be called sons of the living God.
27 But about Israel Isaiah makes this
proclamation: Though the Israelites be
countless as the sands of the sea, only a
remnant shall be saved,
28 for the Lord's sentence on the land
will be summary and final;Romans 9.29–10.3
35
29 as also he said previously, If the Lord
of Hosts had not left us descendants, we
should have become like Sodom, and no
better than Gomorrah.
30 Then what are we to say? That
Gentiles, who made no effort after
righteousness, nevertheless achieved it,
a righteousness based on faith;
31 whereas Israel made great efforts
after a law of righteousness, but never
attained to it.
32 Why was this? Because their efforts
were not based on faith but, mistakenly,
on deeds. They tripped over the stone
33 mentioned in scripture: Here I lay
in Zion a stone to trip over, a rock to
stumble against; but he who has faith in
it will not be put to shame.
1 Friends, my heart's desire and
my prayer to God is for their
salvation.
2 To their zeal for God I can testify; but
it is an ill-informed zeal.
3 For they ignore God's way of
righteousness, and try to set up
their own, and therefore they have
not submitted themselves to God's
righteousness;
10Romans 10.4–12
36
4 for Christ is the end of the law and
brings righteousness for everyone who
has faith.
5 Of righteousness attained through the
law Moses writes, Anyone who keeps it
shall have life by it.
6 But the righteousness that comes by
faith says, Do not say to yourself, Who
can go up to heaven? (that is, to bring
Christ down)
7 or, Who can go down to the abyss? (to
bring Christ up from the dead).
8 And what does it say next? The word
is near you: it is on your lips and in your
heart; and that means the word of faith
which we proclaim.
9 If the confession Jesus is Lord is on
your lips, and the faith that God raised
him from the dead is in your heart, you
will find salvation.
10 For faith in the heart leads to
righteousness, and confession on the
lips leads to salvation.
11 Scripture says, No one who has faith
in him will be put to shame:
12 there is no distinction between Jew
and Greek, because the same Lord isRomans 10.13–19
37
Lord of all, and has riches enough for all
who call on him.
13 For Everyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved.
14 But how could they call on him
without having faith in him? And how
could they have faith without having
heard of him? And how could they hear
without someone to spread the news?
15 And how could anyone spread the
news without being sent? As scripture
says, How welcome are the feet of the
messengers of good news!
16 It is true that not all have responded
to the good news; as Isaiah says, Lord,
who believed when they heard us?
17 So then faith does come from
hearing, and hearing through the word
of Christ.
18 I ask, then: Can it be that they never
heard? Of course they did: Their voice
has sounded all over the world, and their
words to the ends of the earth.
19 I ask again: Can it be that Israel
never understood? Listen first to Moses:
I will use a nation that is no nation to
stir you to envy, and a foolish nation to
rouse your anger.Romans 10.20–11.5
38
20 Isaiah is still more daring: I was
found, he says, by those who were not
looking for me; I revealed myself to
those who never asked about me;
21 while of Israel he says, All day long
I have stretched out my hands to a
disobedient and defiant people.
1 I ASK, then: Has God rejected
his people? Of course not! I am an
Israelite myself, of the stock of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God has not rejected the people he
acknowledged of old as his own. Surely
you know what scripture says in the
story of Elijah -- how he pleads with God
against Israel:
3 Lord, they have killed your prophets,
they have torn down your altars, and I
alone am left, and they are seeking my
life.
4 But what was the divine word to him?
I have left myself seven thousand men
who have not knelt to Baal.
5 In just the same way at the present
time a remnant has come into being,
chosen by the grace of God.
11Romans 11.6–12
39
6 But if it is by grace, then it does not
rest on deeds, or grace would cease to
be grace.
7 What follows? What Israel sought,
Israel has not attained, but the chosen
few have attained it. The rest were
hardened,
8 as it stands written: God has dulled
their senses; he has given them blind
eyes and deaf ears, and so it is to this
day.
9 Similarly David says: May their table
be a snare and a trap, their downfall and
their retribution!
10 May their eyes become darkened and
blind! Bow down their backs unceasingly!
11 I ask, then: When they stumbled,
was their fall final? Far from it! Through
a false step on their part salvation has
come to the Gentiles, and this in turn
will stir them to envy.
12 If their false step means the
enrichment of the world, if their falling
short means the enrichment of the
Gentiles, how much more will their
coming to full strength mean!Romans 11.13–20
40
13 It is to you Gentiles that I am
speaking. As an apostle to the Gentiles,
I make much of that ministry,
14 yet always in the hope of stirring
those of my own race to envy, and so
saving some of them.
15 For if their rejection has meant the
reconciliation of the world, what will their
acceptance mean? Nothing less than life
from the dead!
16 If the first loaf is holy, so is the whole
batch. If the root is holy, so are the
branches.
17 But if some of the branches have
been lopped off, and you, a wild olive,
have been grafted in among them, and
have come to share the same root and
sap as the olive,
18 do not make yourself superior to the
branches. If you do, remember that you
do not sustain the root: the root sustains
you.
19 You will say, Branches were lopped
off so that I might be grafted in.
20 Very well: they were lopped off for
lack of faith, and by faith you hold your
place. Put away your pride, and be on
your guard;Romans 11.21–26
41
21 for if God did not spare the natural
branches, no more will he spare you.
22 Observe the kindness and the
severity of God -- severity to those
who fell away, divine kindness to you
provided that you remain within its
scope; otherwise you too will be cut off,
23 whereas they, if they do not continue
faithless, will be grafted in, since it is in
God's power to graft them in again.
24 For if you were cut from your native
wild olive and against nature grafted
into the cultivated olive, how much
more readily will they, the natural olive
branches, be grafted into their native
stock!
25 There is a divine secret here, my
friends, which I want to share with you,
to keep you from thinking yourselves
wise: this partial hardening has come on
Israel only until the Gentiles have been
admitted in full strength;
26 once that has happened, the whole
of Israel will be saved, in accordance
with scripture: From Zion shall come the
Deliverer; he shall remove wickedness
from Jacob.Romans 11.27–35
42
27 And this is the covenant I will grant
them, when I take away their sins.
28 Judged by their response to the
gospel, they are God's enemies for your
sake; but judged by his choice, they
are dear to him for the sake of the
patriarchs;
29 for the gracious gifts of God and his
calling are irrevocable.
30 Just as formerly you were disobedient
to God, but now have received mercy
because of their disobedience,
31 so now, because of the mercy shown
to you, they have proved disobedient,
but only in order that they too may
receive mercy.
32 For in shutting all mankind in the
prison of their disobedience, God's
purpose was to show mercy to all
mankind.
33 How deep are the wealth and the
wisdom and the knowledge of God!
How inscrutable his judgements, how
unsearchable his ways!
34 Who knows the mind of the Lord?
Who has been his counsellor?
35 Who has made a gift to him first, and
earned a gift in return?Romans 11.36–12.5
43
36 From him and through him and for
him all things exist -- to him be glory for
ever! Amen.
1 THEREFORE, my friends, I
implore you by God's mercy
to offer your very selves to him: a
living sacrifice, dedicated and fit for his
acceptance, the worship offered by mind
and heart.
2 Conform no longer to the pattern of
this present world, but be transformed
by the renewal of your minds. Then you
will be able to discern the will of God,
and to know what is good, acceptable,
and perfect.
3 By authority of the grace God has
given me I say to everyone among you:
do not think too highly of yourself, but
form a sober estimate based on the
measure of faith that God has dealt to
each of you.
4 For just as in a single human body
there are many limbs and organs, all
with different functions,
5 so we who are united with Christ,
though many, form one body, and belong
to one another as its limbs and organs.
12Romans 12.6–16
44
6 Let us use the different gifts allotted
to each of us by God's grace: the gift of
inspired utterance, for example, let us
use in proportion to our faith;
7 the gift of administration to administer,
the gift of teaching to teach,
8 the gift of counselling to counsel.
If you give to charity, give without
grudging; if you are a leader, lead
with enthusiasm; if you help others in
distress, do it cheerfully.
9 Love in all sincerity, loathing evil and
holding fast to the good.
10 Let love of the Christian community
show itself in mutual affection. Esteem
others more highly than yourself.
11 With unflagging zeal, aglow with the
Spirit, serve the Lord.
12 Let hope keep you joyful; in trouble
stand firm; persist in prayer;
13 contribute to the needs of God's
people, and practise hospitality.
14 Call down blessings on your
persecutors -- blessings, not curses.
15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep
with those who weep.
16 Live in agreement with one another.
Do not be proud, but be ready toRomans 12.17–13.2
45
mix with humble people. Do not keep
thinking how wise you are.
17 Never pay back evil for evil. Let your
aims be such as all count honourable.
18 If possible, so far as it lies with you,
live at peace with all.
19 My dear friends, do not seek
revenge, but leave a place for divine
retribution; for there is a text which
reads, Vengeance is mine, says the Lord,
I will repay.
20 But there is another text: If your
enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is
thirsty, give him a drink; by doing this
you will heap live coals on his head.
21 Do not let evil conquer you, but use
good to conquer evil.
1 Every person must submit to
the authorities in power, for all
authority comes from God, and the
existing authorities are instituted by
him.
2 It follows that anyone who rebels
against authority is resisting a divine
institution, and those who resist have
themselves to thank for the punishment
they will receive.
13Romans 13.3–9
46
3 Governments hold no terrors for the
law-abiding but only for the criminal. You
wish to have no fear of the authorities?
Then continue to do right and you will
have their approval,
4 for they are God's agents working
for your good. But if you are doing
wrong, then you will have cause to fear
them; it is not for nothing that they hold
the power of the sword, for they are
God's agents of punishment bringing
retribution on the offender.
5 That is why you are obliged to submit.
It is an obligation imposed not merely by
fear of retribution but by conscience.
6 That is also why you pay taxes. The
authorities are in God's service and it is
to this they devote their energies.
7 Discharge your obligations to
everyone; pay tax and levy, reverence
and respect, to those to whom they are
due.
8 Leave no debt outstanding, but
remember the debt of love you owe one
another. He who loves his neighbour has
met every requirement of the law.
9 The commandments, You shall not
commit adultery, you shall not commitRomans 13.10–14.1
47
murder, you shall not steal, you shall
not covet, and any other commandment
there may be, are all summed up in
the one rule, Love your neighbour as
yourself.
10 Love cannot wrong a neighbour;
therefore love is the fulfilment of the
law.
11 Always remember that this is the
hour of crisis: it is high time for you
to wake out of sleep, for deliverance is
nearer to us now than it was when first
we believed.
12 It is far on in the night; day is near.
Let us therefore throw off the deeds of
darkness and put on the armour of light.
13 Let us behave with decency as
befits the day: no drunken orgies, no
debauchery or vice, no quarrels or
jealousies!
14 Let Christ Jesus himself be the
armour that you wear; give your
unspiritual nature no opportunity to
satisfy its desires.
1 ACCEPT anyone who is weak
in faith without debate about his
misgivings.
14Romans 14.2–7
48
2 For instance, one person may have
faith strong enough to eat all kinds of
food, while another who is weaker eats
only vegetables.
3 Those who eat meat must not look
down on those who do not, and those
who do not eat meat must not pass
judgement on those who do; for God has
accepted them.
4 Who are you to pass judgement
on someone else's servant? Whether
he stands or falls is his own Master's
business; and stand he will, because
his Master has power to enable him to
stand.
5 Again, some make a distinction
between this day and that; others regard
all days alike. Everyone must act on his
own convictions.
6 Those who honour the day honour
the Lord, and those who eat meat also
honour the Lord, since when they eat
they give thanks to God; and those who
abstain have the Lord in mind when
abstaining, since they too give thanks to
God.
7 For none of us lives, and equally none
of us dies, for himself alone.Romans 14.8–15
49
8 If we live, we live for the Lord; and if
we die, we die for the Lord. So whether
we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
9 This is why Christ died and lived again,
to establish his lordship over both dead
and living.
10 You, then, why do you pass
judgement on your fellow-Christian?
And you, why do you look down on
your fellow-Christian? We shall all stand
before God's tribunal;
11 for we read in scripture, As I live,
says the Lord, to me every knee shall
bow and every tongue acknowledge God.
12 So, you see, each of us will be
answerable to God.
13 Let us therefore cease judging one
another, but rather make up our minds
to place no obstacle or stumbling block
in a fellow-Christian's way.
14 All that I know of the Lord Jesus
convinces me that nothing is impure
in itself; only, if anyone considers
something impure, then for him it is
impure.
15 If your fellow-Christian is outraged
by what you eat, then you are no longerRomans 14.16–23
50
guided by love. Do not by your eating be
the ruin of one for whom Christ died!
16 You must not let what you think good
be brought into disrepute;
17 for the kingdom of God is not eating
and drinking, but justice, peace, and joy,
inspired by the Holy Spirit.
18 Everyone who shows himself a
servant of Christ in this way is acceptable
to God and approved by men.
19 Let us, then, pursue the things that
make for peace and build up the common
life.
20 Do not destroy the work of God for
the sake of food. Everything is pure in
itself, but it is wrong to eat if by eating
you cause another to stumble.
21 It is right to abstain from eating
meat or drinking wine or from anything
else which causes a fellow-Christian to
stumble.
22 If you have some firm conviction,
keep it between yourself and God.
Anyone who can make his decision
without misgivings is fortunate.
23 But anyone who has misgivings and
yet eats is guilty, because his action does
not arise from conviction, and anythingRomans 15.1–7
51
which does not arise from conviction is
sin.
1 Those of us who are strong must
accept as our own burden the
tender scruples of the weak, and not just
please ourselves.
2 Each of us must consider his neighbour
and think what is for his good and will
build up the common life.
3 Christ too did not please himself; to
him apply the words of scripture, The
reproaches of those who reproached you
fell on me.
4 The scriptures written long ago were
all written for our instruction, in order
that through the encouragement they
give us we may maintain our hope with
perseverance.
5 And may God, the source of all
perseverance and all encouragement,
grant that you may agree with one
another after the manner of Christ Jesus,
6 and so with one mind and one voice
may praise the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
7 In a word, accept one another as
Christ accepted us, to the glory of God.
15Romans 15.8–14
52
8 Remember that Christ became a
servant of the Jewish people to maintain
the faithfulness of God by making good
his promises to the patriarchs,
9 and by giving the Gentiles cause to
glorify God for his mercy. As scripture
says, Therefore I will praise you among
the Gentiles and sing hymns to your
name;
10 and again, Gentiles, join in
celebration with his people;
11 and yet again, All Gentiles, praise the
Lord; let all peoples praise him.
12 Once again, Isaiah says, The Scion
of Jesse shall come, a ruler who rises to
govern the Gentiles; on him shall they
set their hope.
13 And may God, who is the ground of
hope, fill you with all joy and peace as
you lead the life of faith until, by the
power of the Holy Spirit, you overflow
with hope.
14 MY friends, I have no doubt in my
own mind that you yourselves are full of
goodness and equipped with knowledge
of every kind, well able to give advice to
one another;Romans 15.15–20
53
15 nevertheless I have written to refresh
your memory, and written somewhat
boldly at times, in virtue of the gift I
have from God.
16 His grace has made me a minister
of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles; and in
the service of the gospel of God it is my
priestly task to offer the Gentiles to him
as an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated
by the Holy Spirit.
17 In Christ Jesus I have indeed grounds
for pride in the service of God.
18 I will venture to speak only of what
Christ has done through me to bring the
Gentiles into his allegiance, by word and
deed,
19 by the power of signs and portents,
and by the power of the Holy Spirit. I
have completed the preaching of the
gospel of Christ from Jerusalem as far
round as Illyricum.
20 But I have always made a point of
taking the gospel to places where the
name of Christ has not been heard,
not wanting to build on another man's
foundation;Romans 15.21–28
54
21 as scripture says, Those who had no
news of him shall see, and those who
never heard of him shall understand.
22 That is why I have been prevented all
this time from coming to you.
23 But now I have no further scope in
these parts, and I have been longing for
many years to visit you
24 on my way to Spain; for I hope to
see you in passing, and to be sent on my
way there with your support after having
enjoyed your company for a while.
25 But at the moment I am on my way
to Jerusalem, on an errand to God's
people there.
26 For Macedonia and Achaia have
resolved to raise a fund for the benefit
of the poor among God's people at
Jerusalem.
27 They have resolved to do so, and
indeed they are under an obligation
to them. For if the Jewish Christians
shared their spiritual treasures with the
Gentiles, the Gentiles have a clear duty
to contribute to their material needs.
28 So when I have finished this business
and seen the proceeds safely deliveredRomans 15.29–16.2
55
to them, I shall set out for Spain and
visit you on the way;
29 I am sure that when I come it will
be with a full measure of the blessing of
Christ.
30 I implore you by our Lord Jesus Christ
and by the love that the Spirit inspires,
be my allies in the fight; pray to God for
me
31 that I may be saved from unbelievers
in Judaea and that my errand to
Jerusalem may find acceptance with
God's people,
32 in order that by his will I may come
to you in a happy frame of mind and
enjoy a time of rest with you.
33 The God of peace be with you all.
Amen.
1 I COMMEND to you Phoebe, a
fellow-Christian who is a minister
in the church at Cenchreae.
2 Give her, in the fellowship of the Lord,
a welcome worthy of God's people, and
support her in any business in which she
may need your help, for she has herself
been a good friend to many, including
myself.
16Romans 16.3–11
56
3 Give my greetings to Prisca and
Aquila, my fellow-workers in Christ
Jesus.
4 They risked their necks to save my
life, and not I alone but all the gentile
churches are grateful to them.
5 Greet also the church that meets at
their house. Give my greetings to my
dear friend Epaenetus, the first convert
to Christ in Asia,
6 and to Mary, who worked so hard for
you.
7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my
fellow-countrymen and comrades in
captivity, who are eminent among the
apostles and were Christians before I
was.
8 Greetings to Ampliatus, my dear friend
in the fellowship of the Lord,
9 to Urban my comrade in Christ, and to
my dear Stachys.
10 My greetings to Apelles, well proved
in Christ's service, to the household of
Aristobulus,
11 to my countryman Herodion, and to
those of the household of Narcissus who
are in the Lord's fellowship.Romans 16.12–19
57
12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who
work hard in the Lord's service, and
dear Persis who has worked hard in his
service for so long.
13 Give my greetings to Rufus, an
outstanding follower of the Lord, and to
his mother, whom I call mother too.
14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes,
Patrobas, Hermas, and any other
Christians who are with them.
15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus
and his sister, and Olympas, and all
God's people who are with them.
16 Greet one another with the kiss of
peace. All Christ's churches send you
their greetings.
17 I implore you, my friends, keep
an eye on those who stir up quarrels
and lead others astray, contrary to the
teaching you received. Avoid them;
18 such people are servants not of Christ
our Lord but of their own appetites, and
they seduce the minds of simple people
with smooth and specious words.
19 The fame of your obedience has
spread everywhere, and this makes
me happy about you. I want you to be
expert in goodness, but innocent of evil,Romans 16.20–27
58
20 and the God of peace will soon crush
Satan beneath your feet. The grace of
our Lord Jesus be with you!
21 Greetings to you from my colleague
Timothy, and from Lucius, Jason, and
Sosipater my fellow-countrymen.
22 (I Tertius, who took this letter down,
add my Christian greetings.)
23 Greetings also from Gaius, my host
and host of the whole congregation, and
from Erastus, treasurer of this city, and
our brother Quartus.
24 [[EMPTY]]
25 To him who has power to make
you stand firm, according to my gospel
and the proclamation of Jesus Christ,
according to the revelation of that divine
secret kept in silence for long ages
26 but now disclosed, and by the eternal
God's command made known to all
nations through prophetic scriptures, to
bring them to faith and obedience --
27 to the only wise God through Jesus
Christ be glory for endless ages! Amen.1 Corinthians
1 FROM Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus
1 by God's call and by his will, together
with our colleague Sosthenes,
2 to God's church at Corinth, dedicated
to him in Christ Jesus, called to be his
people, along with all who invoke the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ wherever
they may be -- their Lord as well as ours.
3 Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I am always thanking God for you. I
thank him for his grace given to you in
Christ Jesus;
5 I thank him for all the enrichment that
has come to you in Christ. You possess
full knowledge and you can give full
expression to it,
6 because what we testified about Christ
has been confirmed in your experience.
7 There is indeed no single gift you lack,
while you wait expectantly for our Lord
Jesus Christ to reveal himself.1 Corinthians 1.8– 16
2
8 He will keep you firm to the end,
without reproach on the day of our Lord
Jesus.
9 It is God himself who called you to
share in the life of his Son Jesus Christ
our Lord; and God keeps faith.
10 I APPEAL to you, my friends, in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ: agree
among yourselves, and avoid divisions;
let there be complete unity of mind and
thought.
11 My friends, it has been brought to my
notice by Chloe's people that there are
quarrels among you.
12 What I mean is this: each of you is
saying, I am for Paul, or I am for Apollos;
I am for Cephas, or I am for Christ.
13 Surely Christ has not been divided!
Was it Paul who was crucified for you?
Was it in Paul's name that you were
baptized?
14 Thank God, I never baptized any of
you, except Crispus and Gaius;
15 no one can say you were baptized in
my name.
16 I did of course baptize the household
of Stephanas; I cannot think of anyone
else.1 Corinthians 1.17– 24
3
17 Christ did not send me to baptize,
but to proclaim the gospel; and to do it
without recourse to the skills of rhetoric,
lest the cross of Christ be robbed of its
effect.
18 The message of the cross is sheer
folly to those on the way to destruction,
but to us, who are on the way to
salvation, it is the power of God.
19 Scripture says, I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing
the cleverness of the clever.
20 Where is your wise man now, your
man of learning, your subtle debater
of this present age? God has made the
wisdom of this world look foolish!
21 As God in his wisdom ordained, the
world failed to find him by its wisdom,
and he chose by the folly of the gospel
to save those who have faith.
22 Jews demand signs, Greeks look for
wisdom,
23 but we proclaim Christ nailed to the
cross; and though this is an offence to
Jews and folly to Gentiles,
24 yet to those who are called, Jews and
Greeks alike, he is the power of God and
the wisdom of God.1 Corinthians 1.25–2.1
4
25 The folly of God is wiser than human
wisdom, and the weakness of God
stronger than human strength.
26 My friends, think what sort of people
you are, whom God has called. Few of
you are wise by any human standard,
few powerful or of noble birth.
27 Yet, to shame the wise, God has
chosen what the world counts folly, and
to shame what is strong, God has chosen
what the world counts weakness.
28 He has chosen things without rank or
standing in the world, mere nothings, to
overthrow the existing order.
29 So no place is left for any human
pride in the presence of God.
30 By God's act you are in Christ Jesus;
God has made him our wisdom, and
in him we have our righteousness, our
holiness, our liberation.
31 Therefore, in the words of scripture,
If anyone must boast, let him boast of
the Lord.
1 So it was, my friends, that I came
to you, without any pretensions to
eloquence or wisdom in declaring the
truth about God.
21 Corinthians 2.2 –9
5
2 I resolved that while I was with you
I would not claim to know anything but
Jesus Christ -- Christ nailed to the cross.
3 I came before you in weakness, in
fear, in great trepidation.
4 The word I spoke, the gospel I
proclaimed, did not sway you with clever
arguments; it carried conviction by
spiritual power,
5 so that your faith might be built not on
human wisdom but on the power of God.
6 Among the mature I do speak words of
wisdom, though not a wisdom belonging
to this present age or to its governing
powers, already in decline;
7 I speak God's hidden wisdom, his
secret purpose framed from the very
beginning to bring us to our destined
glory.
8 None of the powers that rule the world
has known that wisdom; if they had,
they would not have crucified the Lord of
glory.
9 Scripture speaks of things beyond our
seeing, things beyond our hearing, things
beyond our imagining, all prepared by
God for those who love him;1 Corinthians 2.10– 16
6
10 and these are what God has revealed
to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit
explores everything, even the depths of
God's own nature.
11 Who knows what a human being is
but the human spirit within him? In the
same way, only the Spirit of God knows
what God is.
12 And we have received this Spirit from
God, not the spirit of the world, so that
we may know all that God has lavished
on us;
13 and, because we are interpreting
spiritual truths to those who have the
Spirit, we speak of these gifts of God
in words taught us not by our human
wisdom but by the Spirit.
14 An unspiritual person refuses what
belongs to the Spirit of God; it is folly
to him; he cannot grasp it, because it
needs to be judged in the light of the
Spirit.
15 But a spiritual person can judge the
worth of everything, yet is not himself
subject to judgement by others.
16 Scripture indeed asks, Who can know
the mind of the Lord or be his counsellor?
Yet we possess the mind of Christ.1 Corinthians 3.1 –8
7
1 BUT I could not talk to you, my
3 friends, as people who have the
Spirit; I had to deal with you on the
natural plane, as infants in Christ.
2 I fed you on milk, instead of solid
food, for which you were not yet ready.
Indeed, you are still not ready for it;
3 you are still on the merely natural
plane. Can you not see that as long as
there is jealousy and strife among you,
you are unspiritual, living on the purely
human level?
4 When one declares, I am for Paul, and
another, I am for Apollos, are you not all
too human?
5 After all, what is Apollos? What is
Paul? Simply God's agents in bringing
you to faith. Each of us performed the
task which the Lord assigned to him:
6 I planted the seed, and Apollos
watered it; but God made it grow.
7 It is not the gardeners with their
planting and watering who count, but
God who makes it grow.
8 Whether they plant or water, they
work as a team, though each will get his
own pay for his own labour.1 Corinthians 3.9– 17
8
9 We are fellow-workers in God's
service; and you are God's garden. Or
again, you are God's building.
10 God gave me the privilege of laying
the foundation like a skilled master
builder; others put up the building. Let
each take care how he builds.
11 There can be no other foundation
than the one already laid: I mean Jesus
Christ himself.
12 If anyone builds on that foundation
with gold, silver, and precious stones, or
with wood, hay, and straw,
13 the work that each does will at last be
brought to light; the day of judgement
will expose it. For that day dawns in fire,
and the fire will test the worth of each
person's work.
14 If anyone's building survives, he will
be rewarded;
15 if it burns down, he will have to bear
the loss; yet he will escape with his life,
though only by passing through the fire.
16 Surely you know that you are God's
temple, where the Spirit of God dwells.
17 Anyone who destroys God's temple
will himself be destroyed by God,1 Corinthians 3.18–4.3
9
because the temple of God is holy; and
you are that temple.
18 Make no mistake about this: if there
is anyone among you who fancies himself
wise -- wise, I mean, by the standards
of this age -- he must become a fool if
he is to be truly wise.
19 For the wisdom of this world is folly
in God's sight. Scripture says, He traps
the wise in their own cunning,
20 and again, The Lord knows that the
arguments of the wise are futile.
21 So never make any human being
a cause for boasting. For everything
belongs to you --
22 Paul, Apollos, and Cephas, the world,
life, and death, the present and the
future, all are yours --
23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ
to God.
1 We are to be regarded as Christ's
subordinates and as stewards of the
secrets of God.
2 Now stewards are required to show
themselves trustworthy.
3 To me it matters not at all if I am
called to account by you or by any
41 Corinthians 4.4 –8
10
human court. Nor do I pass judgement
on myself,
4 for I have nothing on my conscience;
but that does not prove me innocent. My
judge is the Lord.
5 So pass no premature judgement;
wait until the Lord comes. He will bring
to light what darkness hides and disclose
our inward motives; then will be the time
for each to receive commendation from
God.
6 My friends, I have applied all this
to Apollos and myself for your benefit,
so that you may take our case as an
example, and learn the true meaning
of nothing beyond what stands written,
and may not be inflated with pride as
you take sides in support of one against
another.
7 My friend, who makes you so
important? What do you possess that
was not given you? And if you received it
as a gift, why take the credit to yourself?
8 No doubt you already have all you
could desire; you have come into your
fortune already! Without us you have
come into your kingdom. How I wish you1 Corinthians 4.9– 15
11
had indeed come into your kingdom;
then you might share it with us!
9 For it seems to me God has made us
apostles the last act in the show, like
men condemned to death in the arena,
a spectacle to the whole universe -- to
angels as well as men.
10 We are fools for Christ's sake,
while you are sensible Christians! We
are weak; you are powerful! You are
honoured; we are in disgrace!
11 To this day we go hungry and thirsty
and in rags; we are beaten up; we
wander from place to place;
12 we wear ourselves out earning a
living with our own hands. People curse
us, and we bless; they persecute us, and
we submit;
13 they slander us, and we try to be
conciliatory. To this day we are treated
as the scum of the earth, as the dregs of
humanity.
14 I am not writing this to shame you,
but to bring you to reason; for you are
my dear children.
15 You may have thousands of tutors in
Christ, but you have only one father; for
in Christ Jesus you are my offspring, and1 Corinthians 4.16–5.2
12
mine alone, through the preaching of the
gospel.
16 I appeal to you therefore to follow
my example.
17 That is why I have sent Timothy, who
is a dear son to me and a trustworthy
Christian, to remind you of my way of life
in Christ, something I teach everywhere
in all the churches.
18 There are certain persons who are
filled with self-importance because they
think I am not coming to Corinth.
19 I shall come very soon, if it is the
Lord's will; and then I shall take the
measure of these self-important people,
not by what they say, but by what they
can do,
20 for the kingdom of God is not a
matter of words, but of power.
21 Choose, then: am I to come to you
with a rod in my hand, or with love and
a gentle spirit?
1 I ACTUALLY hear reports of sexual
immorality among you, immorality
such as even pagans do not tolerate: the
union of a man with his stepmother.
2 And you are proud of yourselves!
You ought to have gone into mourning;
51 Corinthians 5.3 –8
13
anyone who behaves like that should be
turned out of your community.
3 For my part, though I am absent in
body, I am present in spirit, and have
already reached my judgement on the
man who did this thing, as if I were
indeed present:
4 when you are all assembled in the
name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with
you in spirit, through the power of our
Lord Jesus you are
5 to consign this man to Satan for the
destruction of his body, so that his spirit
may be saved on the day of the Lord.
6 Your self-satisfaction ill becomes you.
Have you never heard the saying, A little
leaven leavens all the dough?
7 Get rid of the old leaven and then you
will be a new batch of unleavened dough.
Indeed you already are, because Christ
our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.
8 So we who observe the festival must
not use the old leaven, the leaven of
depravity and wickedness, but only the
unleavened bread which is sincerity and
truth.1 Corinthians 5.9–6.2
14
9 In my letter I wrote that you must
have nothing to do with those who are
sexually immoral.
10 I was not, of course, referring to
people in general who are immoral or
extortioners or swindlers or idolaters; to
avoid them you would have to withdraw
from society altogether.
11 I meant that you must have nothing
to do with any so-called Christian who
leads an immoral life, or is extortionate,
idolatrous, a slanderer, a drunkard, or
a swindler; with anyone like that you
should not even eat.
12 What business of mine is it to judge
outsiders? God is their judge. But within
the fellowship, you are the judges: Root
out the wrongdoer from your community.
13 (5:12)
1 IF one of your number has a dispute
with another, does he have the face
to go to law before a pagan court instead
of before God's people?
2 It is God's people who are to judge the
world; surely you know that. And if the
world is subject to your judgement, are
you not competent to deal with these
trifling cases?
61 Corinthians 6.3– 10
15
3 Are you not aware that we are to
judge angels, not to mention day to day
affairs?
4 If therefore you have such everyday
disputes, how can you entrust jurisdiction
to outsiders with no standing in the
church?
5 I write this to shame you. Can it be
that there is not among you a single
person wise enough to give a decision in
a fellow-Christian's cause?
6 Must Christian go to law with Christian
-- and before unbelievers at that?
7 Indeed, you suffer defeat by going
to law with one another at all. Why not
rather submit to wrong? Why not let
yourself be defrauded?
8 But instead, it is you who are wronging
and defrauding, and fellow-Christians at
that!
9 Surely you know that wrongdoers will
never possess the kingdom of God. Make
no mistake: no fornicator or idolater, no
adulterer or sexual pervert,
10 no thief, extortioner, drunkard,
slanderer, or swindler will possess the
kingdom of God.1 Corinthians 6.11– 17
16
11 Such were some of you; but you
have been washed clean, you have
been dedicated to God, you have been
justified through the name of the Lord
Jesus and through the Spirit of our God.
12 I am free to do anything, you say.
Yes, but not everything does good. No
doubt I am free to do anything, but I for
one will not let anything make free with
me.
13 Food is for the belly and the belly for
food, you say. True; and one day God
will put an end to both. But the body is
not for fornication; it is for the Lord --
and the Lord for the body.
14 God not only raised our Lord from the
dead; he will also raise us by his power.
15 Do you not know that your bodies are
limbs and organs of Christ? Shall I then
take parts of Christ's body and make
them over to a prostitute? Never!
16 You surely know that anyone who
joins himself to a prostitute becomes
physically one with her, for scripture
says, The two shall become one flesh;
17 but anyone who joins himself to the
Lord is one with him spiritually.1 Corinthians 6.18–7.5
17
18 Have nothing to do with fornication.
Every other sin that one may commit is
outside the body; but the fornicator sins
against his own body.
19 Do you not know that your body is a
temple of the indwelling Holy Spirit, and
the Spirit is God's gift to you? You do not
belong to yourselves;
20 you were bought at a price. Then
honour God in your body.
1 NOW FOR the matters you wrote
about. You say, It is a good thing for
a man not to have intercourse with a
woman.
2 Rather, in the face of so much
immorality, let each man have his own
wife and each woman her own husband.
3 The husband must give the wife what
is due to her, and equally the wife must
give the husband his due.
4 The wife cannot claim her body as her
own; it is her husband's. Equally, the
husband cannot claim his body as his
own; it is his wife's.
5 Do not deny yourselves to one
another, except when you agree to
devote yourselves to prayer for a time,
and to come together again afterwards;
71 Corinthians 7.6– 12
18
otherwise, through lack of self-control,
you may be tempted by Satan.
6 I say this by way of concession, not
command.
7 I should like everyone to be as I
myself am; but each person has the gift
God has granted him, one this gift and
another that.
8 To the unmarried and to widows I say
this: it is a good thing if like me they
stay as they are;
9 but if they do not have self-control,
they should marry. It is better to be
married than burn with desire.
10 To the married I give this ruling,
which is not mine but the Lord's: a
wife must not separate herself from her
husband --
11 if she does, she must either remain
unmarried or be reconciled to her
husband -- and the husband must not
divorce his wife.
12 To the rest I say this, as my own
word, not as the Lord's: if a Christian
has a wife who is not a believer, and she
is willing to live with him, he must not
divorce her;1 Corinthians 7.13– 18
19
13 and if a woman has a husband who
is not a believer, and he is willing to live
with her, she must not divorce him.
14 For the husband now belongs to
God through his Christian wife, and the
wife through her Christian husband.
Otherwise your children would not
belong to God, whereas in fact they do.
15 If however the unbelieving partner
wishes for a separation, it should be
granted; in such cases the Christian
husband or wife is not bound by the
marriage. God's call is a call to live in
peace.
16 But remember: a wife may save her
husband; and a husband may save his
wife.
17 However that may be, each one
should accept the lot which the Lord has
assigned him and continue as he was
when God called him. That is the rule I
give in all the churches.
18 Was a man called with the marks of
circumcision on him? Let him not remove
them. Was he uncircumcised when he
was called? Let him not be circumcised.1 Corinthians 7.19– 26
20
19 Circumcision or uncircumcision is
neither here nor there; what matters is
to keep God's commands.
20 Everyone should remain in the
condition in which he was called.
21 Were you a slave when you were
called? Do not let that trouble you;
though if a chance of freedom should
come, by all means take it.
22 Anyone who received his call to be
a Christian while a slave is the Lord's
freedman, and, equally, every free man
who has received the call is a slave in
the service of Christ.
23 You were bought at a price; do not
become slaves of men.
24 So, my friends, everyone is to remain
before God in the condition in which he
received his call.
25 About the unmarried, I have no
instructions from the Lord, but I give my
opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy
is fit to be trusted.
26 I think the best way for a man to live
in a time of stress like the present is this
-- to remain as he is.1 Corinthians 7.27– 34
21
27 Are you bound in marriage? Do not
seek a dissolution. Has your marriage
been dissolved? Do not seek a wife.
28 But if you do marry, you are not
doing anything wrong, nor does a girl if
she marries; it is only that those who
marry will have hardships to endure, and
my aim is to spare you.
29 What I mean, my friends, is this: the
time we live in will not last long. While it
lasts, married men should be as if they
had no wives;
30 mourners should be as if they had
nothing to grieve them, the joyful as
if they did not rejoice; those who buy
should be as if they possessed nothing,
31 and those who use the world's wealth
as if they did not have full use of it. For
the world as we know it is passing away.
32 I want you to be free from anxious
care. An unmarried man is concerned
with the Lord's business; his aim is to
please the Lord.
33 But a married man is concerned with
worldly affairs; his aim is to please his
wife,
34 and he is pulled in two directions. The
unmarried woman or girl is concerned1 Corinthians 7.35– 39
22
with the Lord's business; her aim is to
be dedicated to him in body as in spirit.
But the married woman is concerned
with worldly affairs; her aim is to please
her husband.
35 In saying this I am thinking simply of
your own good. I have no wish to keep
you on a tight rein; I only want you to
be beyond criticism and be free from
distraction in your devotion to the Lord.
36 But if a man feels that he is not
behaving properly towards the girl to
whom he is betrothed, if his passions
are strong and something must be done,
let him carry out his intention by getting
married; there is nothing wrong in it.
37 But if a man is steadfast in his
purpose and under no obligation, if he is
free to act at his own discretion, and has
decided in his own mind to respect her
virginity, he will do well.
38 Thus he who marries his betrothed
does well, and he who does not marry
does better.
39 A wife is bound to her husband as
long as he lives. But if the husband
dies, she is free to marry whom she1 Corinthians 7.40–8.6
23
will, provided the marriage is within the
Lord's fellowship.
40 But she is better off as she is; that is
my opinion, and I believe that I too have
the Spirit of God.
1 NOW ABOUT meat consecrated to
heathen deities. Of course We all
have knowledge, as you say. Knowledge
inflates a man, whereas love builds him
up.
2 If anyone fancies that he has some
kind of knowledge, he does not yet know
in the true sense of knowing.
3 But if anyone loves God, he is known
by God.
4 Well then, about eating this
consecrated meat: of course, as you say,
A false god has no real existence, and
there is no god but one.
5 Even though there be so-called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth -- and
indeed there are many such gods and
many such lords --
6 yet for us there is one God, the Father,
from whom are all things, and we exist
for him; there is one Lord, Jesus Christ,
through whom are all things, and we
exist through him.
81 Corinthians 8.7– 13
24
7 But not everyone possesses this
knowledge. There are some who have
been so accustomed to idolatry that they
still think of this meat as consecrated
to the idol, and their conscience, being
weak, is defiled by eating it.
8 Certainly food will not bring us into
God's presence: if we do not eat, we are
none the worse, and if we do eat, we are
none the better.
9 But be careful that this liberty of yours
does not become a pitfall for the weak.
10 If one of them sees you sitting down
to a meal in a heathen temple -- you with
your knowledge -- will not his conscience
be emboldened to eat meat consecrated
to the heathen deity?
11 This knowledge of yours destroys
the weak, the fellow-Christian for whom
Christ died.
12 In sinning against your brothers and
sisters in this way and wounding their
conscience, weak as it is, you sin against
Christ.
13 Therefore, if food be the downfall of
a fellow-Christian, I will never eat meat
again, for I will not be the cause of a
fellow-Christian's downfall.1 Corinthians 9.1 –9
25
1 AM I not free? Am I not an apostle?
9 Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are
not you my own handiwork in the Lord?
2 If others do not accept me as an
apostle, you at least are bound to do so,
for in the Lord you are the very seal of
my apostleship.
3 To those who would call me to account,
this is my defence:
4 Have I no right to eat and drink?
5 Have I not the right to take a Christian
wife about with me, like the rest of the
apostles and the Lord's brothers and
Cephas?
6 Are only Barnabas and I bound to
work for our living?
7 Did you ever hear of a man serving
in the army at his own expense? Or
planting a vineyard without eating the
fruit? Or tending a flock without using
the milk?
8 My case does not rest on these human
analogies, for the law says the same;
9 in the law of Moses we read, You shall
not muzzle an ox while it is treading out
the grain. Do you suppose God's concern
is with oxen?1 Corinthians 9.10– 16
26
10 Must not the saying refer to us? Of
course it does: the ploughman should
plough and the thresher thresh in hope
of sharing the produce.
11 If we have sown a spiritual crop for
you, is it too much to expect from you a
material harvest?
12 If you allow others those rights, have
not we a stronger claim? But I have
never availed myself of any such right.
On the contrary, I put up with all that
comes my way rather than offer any
hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
13 You must know that those who are
engaged in temple service eat the temple
offerings, and those who officiate at the
altar claim their share of the sacrifice.
14 In the same way the Lord gave
instructions that those who preach the
gospel should get their living by the
gospel.
15 But I have never taken advantage of
any such right, nor do I intend to claim
it in this letter. I had rather die! No one
shall make my boast an empty boast.
16 Even if I preach the gospel, I can
claim no credit for it; I cannot help1 Corinthians 9.17– 23
27
myself; it would be agony for me not to
preach.
17 If I did it of my own choice, I should
be earning my pay; but since I have no
choice, I am simply discharging a trust.
18 Then what is my pay? It is the
satisfaction of preaching the gospel
without expense to anyone; in other
words, of waiving the rights my
preaching gives me.
19 I am free and own no master; but I
have made myself everyone's servant,
to win over as many as possible.
20 To Jews I behaved like a Jew, to win
Jews; that is, to win those under the law
I behaved as if under the law, though
not myself subject to the law.
21 To win those outside that law, I
behaved as if outside the law, though
not myself outside God's law, but subject
to the law of Christ.
22 To the weak I became weak, to win
the weak. To them all I have become
everything in turn, so that in one way or
another I may save some.
23 All this I do for the sake of the gospel,
to have a share in its blessings.1 Corinthians 9.24–10.5
28
24 At the games, as you know, all the
runners take part, though only one wins
the prize.
25 You also must run to win. Every
athlete goes into strict training. They do
it to win a fading garland; we, to win a
garland that never fades.
26 For my part, I am no aimless runner;
I am not a boxer who beats the air.
27 I do not spare my body, but bring it
under strict control, for fear that after
preaching to others I should find myself
disqualified.
1 Let me remind you, my friends,
that our ancestors were all under
the cloud, and all of them passed
through the Red Sea;
2 so they all received baptism into the
fellowship of Moses in cloud and sea.
3 They all ate the same supernatural
food,
4 and all drank the same supernatural
drink; for they drank from the
supernatural rock that accompanied
their travels -- and that rock was Christ.
5 Yet most of them were not accepted
by God, for the wilderness was strewn
with their corpses.
101 Corinthians 10.6– 14
29
6 These events happened as warnings
to us not to set our desires on evil things
as they did.
7 Do not be idolaters, like some of
them; as scripture says, The people sat
down to feast and rose up to revel.
8 Let us not commit fornication; some
of them did, and twenty-three thousand
died in one day.
9 Let us not put the Lord to the test as
some of them did; they were destroyed
by the snakes.
10 Do not grumble as some of them did;
they were destroyed by the Destroyer.
11 All these things that happened to
them were symbolic, and were recorded
as a warning for us, upon whom the end
of the ages has come.
12 If you think you are standing firm,
take care, or you may fall.
13 So far you have faced no trial beyond
human endurance; God keeps faith and
will not let you be tested beyond your
powers, but when the test comes he will
at the same time provide a way out and
so enable you to endure.
14 SO THEN, my dear friends, have
nothing to do with idolatry.1 Corinthians 10.15–22
30
15 I appeal to you as sensible people;
form your own judgement on what I say.
16 When we bless the cup of blessing, is
it not a means of sharing in the blood
of Christ? When we break the bread, is
it not a means of sharing in the body of
Christ?
17 Because there is one loaf, we, though
many, are one body; for it is one loaf of
which we all partake.
18 Consider Jewish practice: are not
those who eat the sacrificial meal
partners in the altar?
19 What do I imply by this? That meat
consecrated to an idol is anything more
than meat, or that an idol is anything
more than an idol?
20 No, I mean that pagan sacrifices are
offered (in the words of scripture) to
demons and to that which is not God;
and I will not have you become partners
with demons.
21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons. You cannot
partake of the Lord's table and the table
of demons.
22 Are we to provoke the Lord? Are we
stronger than he is?1 Corinthians 10.23–30
31
23 We are free to do anything, you say.
Yes, but not everything is good for us.
We are free to do anything, but not
everything builds up the community.
24 You should each look after the
interests of others, not your own.
25 You may eat anything sold in the
meat market without raising questions
of conscience;
26 for the earth is the Lord's and all that
is in it.
27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal
and you accept, eat whatever is put
before you, without raising questions of
conscience.
28 But if somebody says to you, This
food has been offered in sacrifice, then,
out of consideration for him and for
conscience' sake, do not eat it --
29 not your conscience, I mean, but
his. What? you say. Is my freedom
to be called in question by another's
conscience?
30 If I partake with thankfulness, why
am I blamed for eating food over which I
have said grace?1 Corinthians 10.31– 11.6
32
31 You may eat or drink, or do anything
else, provided it is all done to the glory
of God;
32 give no offence to Jews, or Greeks,
or to the church of God.
33 For my part I always try to be
considerate to everyone, not seeking my
own good but the good of the many, so
that they may be saved.
1 Follow my example as I follow
Christ's.
2 I COMMEND you for always keeping
me in mind, and maintaining the tradition
I handed on to you.
3 But I wish you to understand that,
while every man has Christ for his head,
a woman's head is man, as Christ's head
is God.
4 A man who keeps his head covered
when he prays or prophesies brings
shame on his head;
5 but a woman brings shame on
her head if she prays or prophesies
bareheaded; it is as bad as if her head
were shaved.
6 If a woman does not cover her head
she might as well have her hair cut
off; but if it is a disgrace for her to be
111 Corinthians 11.7– 16
33
cropped and shaved, then she should
cover her head.
7 A man must not cover his head,
because man is the image of God, and
the mirror of his glory, whereas a woman
reflects the glory of man.
8 For man did not originally spring from
woman, but woman was made out of
man;
9 and man was not created for woman's
sake, but woman for the sake of man;
10 and therefore a woman must have
the sign of her authority on her head,
out of regard for the angels.
11 Yet in the Lord's fellowship woman is
as essential to man as man to woman.
12 If woman was made out of man, it is
through woman that man now comes to
be; and God is the source of all.
13 Judge for yourselves: is it fitting for a
woman to pray to God bareheaded?
14 Does not nature herself teach you
that while long hair disgraces a man,
15 it is a woman's glory? For her hair
was given as a covering.
16 And if anyone still insists on arguing,
there is no such custom among us, or1 Corinthians 11.17–23
34
in any of the congregations of God's
people.
17 In giving you these instructions I
come to something I cannot commend:
your meetings tend to do more harm
than good.
18 To begin with, I am told that when
you meet as a congregation you fall into
sharply divided groups. I believe there is
some truth in it,
19 for divisions are bound to arise
among you if only to show which of your
members are genuine.
20 The result is that when you meet as a
congregation, it is not the Lord's Supper
you eat; when it comes to eating,
21 each of you takes his own supper,
one goes hungry and another has too
much to drink.
22 Have you no homes of your own
to eat and drink in? Or are you so
contemptuous of the church of God that
you shame its poorer members? What
am I to say? Can I commend you? On
this point, certainly not!
23 For the tradition which I handed on to
you came to me from the Lord himself:1 Corinthians 11.24–31
35
that on the night of his arrest the Lord
Jesus took bread,
24 and after giving thanks to God broke
it and said: This is my body, which is for
you; do this in memory of me.
25 In the same way, he took the cup
after supper, and said: This cup is
the new covenant sealed by my blood.
Whenever you drink it, do this in memory
of me.
26 For every time you eat this bread and
drink the cup, you proclaim the death of
the Lord, until he comes.
27 It follows that anyone who eats the
bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
unworthily will be guilty of offending
against the body and blood of the Lord.
28 Everyone must test himself before
eating from the bread and drinking from
the cup.
29 For he who eats and drinks eats and
drinks judgement on himself if he does
not discern the body.
30 That is why many of you are feeble
and sick, and a number have died.
31 But if we examined ourselves, we
should not fall under judgement.1 Corinthians 11.32– 12.5
36
32 When, however, we do fall under the
Lord's judgement, he is disciplining us to
save us from being condemned with the
rest of the world.
33 Therefore, my friends, when you
meet for this meal, wait for one another.
34 If you are hungry, eat at home, so
that in meeting together you may not
fall under judgement. The other matters
I will settle when I come.
1 ABOUT gifts of the Spirit, my
friends, I want there to be no
misunderstanding.
2 You know how, in the days when you
were still pagan, you used to be carried
away by some impulse or other to those
dumb heathen gods.
3 For this reason I must impress upon
you that no one who says A curse
on Jesus! can be speaking under the
influence of the Spirit of God; and no
one can say Jesus is Lord! except under
the influence of the Holy Spirit.
4 There are varieties of gifts, but the
same Spirit.
5 There are varieties of service, but the
same Lord.
121 Corinthians 12.6– 13
37
6 There are varieties of activity, but in
all of them and in everyone the same
God is active.
7 In each of us the Spirit is seen to be
at work for some useful purpose.
8 One, through the Spirit, has the gift of
wise speech, while another, by the power
of the same Spirit, can put the deepest
knowledge into words.
9 Another, by the same Spirit, is granted
faith; another, by the one Spirit, gifts of
healing,
10 and another miraculous powers;
another has the gift of prophecy, and
another the ability to distinguish true
spirits from false; yet another has the
gift of tongues of various kinds, and
another the ability to interpret them.
11 But all these gifts are the activity of
one and the same Spirit, distributing
them to each individual at will.
12 Christ is like a single body with its
many limbs and organs, which, many as
they are, together make up one body;
13 for in the one Spirit we were all
brought into one body by baptism,
whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free;
we were all given that one Spirit to drink.1 Corinthians 12.14–23
38
14 A body is not a single organ, but
many.
15 Suppose the foot were to say,
Because I am not a hand, I do not belong
to the body, it belongs to the body none
the less.
16 Suppose the ear were to say, Because
I am not an eye, I do not belong to the
body, it still belongs to the body.
17 If the body were all eye, how could it
hear? If the body were all ear, how could
it smell?
18 But, in fact, God appointed each limb
and organ to its own place in the body
as he chose.
19 If the whole were a single organ,
there would not be a body at all;
20 in fact, however, there are many
different organs, but one body.
21 The eye cannot say to the hand, I do
not need you, or the head to the feet, I
do not need you.
22 Quite the contrary: those parts of the
body which seem to be more frail than
others are indispensable,
23 and those parts of the body which we
regard as less honourable are treated
with special honour. The parts we are1 Corinthians 12.24–31
39
modest about are treated with special
respect,
24 whereas our respectable parts have
no such need. But God has combined the
various parts of the body, giving special
honour to the humbler parts,
25 so that there might be no division in
the body, but that all its parts might feel
the same concern for one another.
26 If one part suffers, all suffer together;
if one flourishes, all rejoice together.
27 Now you are Christ's body, and each
of you a limb or organ of it.
28 Within our community God has
appointed in the first place apostles,
in the second place prophets, thirdly
teachers; then miracle-workers, then
those who have gifts of healing, or ability
to help others or power to guide them,
or the gift of tongues of various kinds.
29 Are all apostles? All prophets? All
teachers? Do all work miracles?
30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all
speak in tongues of ecstasy? Can all
interpret them?
31 The higher gifts are those you should
prize. But I can show you an even better
way.1 Corinthians 13.1– 9
40
1 I may speak in tongues of men
13 or of angels, but if I have no love,
I am a sounding gong or a clanging
cymbal.
2 I may have the gift of prophecy
and the knowledge of every hidden
truth; I may have faith enough to move
mountains; but if I have no love, I am
nothing.
3 I may give all I possess to the needy,
I may give my body to be burnt, but if I
have no love, I gain nothing by it.
4 Love is patient and kind. Love
envies no one, is never boastful, never
conceited,
5 never rude; love is never selfish,
never quick to take offence. Love keeps
no score of wrongs,
6 takes no pleasure in the sins of others,
but delights in the truth.
7 There is nothing love cannot face;
there is no limit to its faith, its hope, its
endurance.
8 Love will never come to an end.
Prophecies will cease; tongues of ecstasy
will fall silent; knowledge will vanish.
9 For our knowledge and our prophecy
alike are partial,1 Corinthians 13.10– 14.3
41
10 and the partial vanishes when
wholeness comes.
11 When I was a child I spoke like a
child, thought like a child, reasoned like
a child; but when I grew up I finished
with childish things.
12 At present we see only puzzling
reflections in a mirror, but one day we
shall see face to face. My knowledge
now is partial; then it will be whole, like
God's knowledge of me.
13 There are three things that last for
ever: faith, hope, and love; and the
greatest of the three is love.
1 Make love your aim; then be
eager for the gifts of the Spirit,
above all for prophecy.
2 If anyone speaks in tongues he is
talking with God, not with men and
women; no one understands him, for he
speaks divine mysteries in the Spirit.
3 On the other hand, if anyone
prophesies, he is talking to men and
women, and his words have power
to build; they stimulate and they
encourage.
141 Corinthians 14.4– 10
42
4 Speaking in tongues may build up the
speaker himself, but it is prophecy that
builds up a Christian community.
5 I am happy for you all to speak in
tongues, but happier still for you to
prophesy. The prophet is worth more
than one who speaks in tongues -- unless
indeed he can explain its meaning, and
so help to build up the community.
6 Suppose, my friends, that when I
come to you I speak in tongues: what
good shall I do you unless what I say
contains something by way of revelation,
or enlightenment, or prophecy, or
instruction?
7 Even with inanimate things that
produce sounds -- a flute, say, or a lyre
-- unless their notes are distinct, how
can you tell what tune is being played?
8 Or again, if the trumpet-call is not
clear, who will prepare for battle?
9 In the same way, if what you say in
tongues yields no precise meaning, how
can anyone tell what is being said? You
will be talking to empty air.
10 There are any number of different
languages in the world; nowhere is
without language.1 Corinthians 14.11–19
43
11 If I do not know the speaker's
language, his words will be gibberish to
me, and mine to him.
12 You are, I know, eager for gifts of the
Spirit; then aspire above all to excel in
those which build up the church.
13 Anyone who speaks in tongues should
pray for the ability to interpret.
14 If I use such language in prayer, my
spirit prays, but my mind is barren.
15 What then? I will pray with my spirit,
but also with my mind; I will sing hymns
with my spirit, but with my mind as well.
16 Suppose you are praising God with
the spirit alone: how will an ordinary
person who is present be able to say
Amen to your thanksgiving, when he
does not know what you are saying?
17 Your prayer of thanksgiving may be
splendid, but it is no help to the other
person.
18 Thank God, I am more gifted in
tongues than any of you,
19 but in the congregation I would
rather speak five intelligible words, for
the benefit of others as well as myself,
than thousands of words in the language
of ecstasy.1 Corinthians 14.20–26
44
20 Do not be children in your thinking,
my friends; be infants in evil, but in your
thinking be grown-up.
21 We read in the law: I will speak to
this people through strange tongues,
and by the lips of foreigners; and even
so they will not heed me, says the Lord.
22 Clearly then these strange tongues
are not intended as a sign for believers,
but for unbelievers, whereas prophecy
is designed not for unbelievers but for
believers.
23 So if the whole congregation is
assembled and all are using the
strange tongues of ecstasy, and some
uninstructed persons or unbelievers
should enter, will they not think you are
mad?
24 But if all are uttering prophecies,
the visitor, when he enters, hears from
everyone something that searches his
conscience and brings conviction,
25 and the secrets of his heart are laid
bare. So he will fall down and worship
God, declaring, God is certainly among
you!
26 To sum up, my friends: when
you meet for worship, each of you1 Corinthians 14.27–34
45
contributing a hymn, some instruction,
a revelation, an ecstatic utterance, or its
interpretation, see that all of these aim
to build up the church.
27 If anyone speaks in tongues, only
two should speak, or at most three, one
at a time, and someone must interpret.
28 If there is no interpreter, they should
keep silent and speak to themselves and
to God.
29 Of the prophets, two or three may
speak, while the rest exercise their
judgement upon what is said.
30 If someone else present receives a
revelation, let the first speaker stop.
31 You can all prophesy, one at a time,
so that all may receive instruction and
encouragement.
32 It is for prophets to control prophetic
inspiration,
33 for God is not a God of disorder but
of peace. As in all congregations of God's
people,
34 women should keep silent at the
meeting. They have no permission to
talk, but should keep their place as the
law directs.1 Corinthians 14.35– 15.2
46
35 If there is something they want to
know, they can ask their husbands at
home. It is a shocking thing for a woman
to talk at the meeting.
36 Did the word of God originate with
you? Or are you the only people to whom
it came?
37 If anyone claims to be inspired or a
prophet, let him recognize that what I
write has the Lord's authority.
38 If he does not acknowledge this, his
own claim cannot be acknowledged.
39 In short, my friends, be eager to
prophesy; do not forbid speaking in
tongues;
40 but let all be done decently and in
order.
1 AND now, my friends, I must
remind you of the gospel that I
preached to you; the gospel which you
received, on which you have taken your
stand,
2 and which is now bringing you
salvation. Remember the terms in which
I preached the gospel to you -- for I
assume that you hold it fast and that
your conversion was not in vain.
151 Corinthians 15.3– 11
47
3 First and foremost, I handed on to you
the tradition I had received: that Christ
died for our sins, in accordance with the
scriptures;
4 that he was buried; that he was raised
to life on the third day, in accordance
with the scriptures;
5 and that he appeared to Cephas, and
afterwards to the Twelve.
6 Then he appeared to over five hundred
of our brothers at once, most of whom
are still alive, though some have died.
7 Then he appeared to James, and
afterwards to all the apostles.
8 Last of all he appeared to me too; it
was like a sudden, abnormal birth.
9 For I am the least of the apostles,
indeed not fit to be called an apostle,
because I had persecuted the church of
God.
10 However, by God's grace I am what I
am, and his grace to me has not proved
vain; in my labours I have outdone them
all -- not I, indeed, but the grace of God
working with me.
11 But no matter whether it was I or
they! This is what we all proclaim, and
this is what you believed.1 Corinthians 15.12–20
48
12 Now if this is what we proclaim, that
Christ was raised from the dead, how can
some of you say there is no resurrection
of the dead?
13 If there is no resurrection, then Christ
was not raised;
14 and if Christ was not raised, then our
gospel is null and void, and so too is
your faith;
15 and we turn out to have given false
evidence about God, because we bore
witness that he raised Christ to life,
whereas, if the dead are not raised, he
did not raise him.
16 For if the dead are not raised, it
follows that Christ was not raised;
17 and if Christ was not raised, your
faith has nothing to it and you are still in
your old state of sin.
18 It follows also that those who have
died within Christ's fellowship are utterly
lost.
19 If it is for this life only that Christ has
given us hope, we of all people are most
to be pitied.
20 But the truth is, Christ was raised to
life -- the firstfruits of the harvest of the
dead.1 Corinthians 15.21–29
49
21 For since it was a man who brought
death into the world, a man also brought
resurrection of the dead.
22 As in Adam all die, so in Christ all will
be brought to life;
23 but each in proper order: Christ the
firstfruits, and afterwards, at his coming,
those who belong to Christ.
24 Then comes the end, when he
delivers up the kingdom to God the
Father, after deposing every sovereignty,
authority, and power.
25 For he is destined to reign until God
has put all enemies under his feet;
26 and the last enemy to be deposed is
death.
27 Scripture says, He has put all things
in subjection under his feet. But in saying
all things, it clearly means to exclude
God who made all things subject to him;
28 and when all things are subject to
him, then the Son himself will also be
made subject to God who made all things
subject to him, and thus God will be all
in all.
29 Again, there are those who receive
baptism on behalf of the dead. What do
you suppose they are doing? If the dead1 Corinthians 15.30–38
50
are not raised to life at all, what do they
mean by being baptized on their behalf?
30 And why do we ourselves face danger
hour by hour?
31 Every day I die: I swear it by my
pride in you, my friends -- for in Christ
Jesus our Lord I am proud of you.
32 With no more than human hopes,
what would have been the point of my
fighting those wild beasts at Ephesus? If
the dead are never raised to life, Let us
eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
33 Make no mistake: Bad company ruins
good character.
34 Wake up, be sober, and stop sinning:
some of you have no knowledge of God
-- to your shame I say it.
35 But, you may ask, how are the dead
raised? In what kind of body?
36 What stupid questions! The seed you
sow does not come to life unless it has
first died;
37 and what you sow is not the body
that shall be, but a bare grain, of wheat
perhaps, or something else;
38 and God gives it the body of his
choice, each seed its own particular
body.1 Corinthians 15.39–46
51
39 All flesh is not the same: there is
human flesh, flesh of beasts, of birds,
and of fishes -- all different.
40 There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies; and the splendour of
the heavenly bodies is one thing, the
splendour of the earthly another.
41 The sun has a splendour of its own,
the moon another splendour, and the
stars yet another; and one star differs
from another in brightness.
42 So it is with the resurrection of the
dead: what is sown as a perishable thing
is raised imperishable.
43 Sown in humiliation, it is raised in
glory; sown in weakness, it is raised in
power;
44 sown a physical body, it is raised a
spiritual body. If there is such a thing as
a physical body, there is also a spiritual
body.
45 It is in this sense that scripture says,
The first man, Adam, became a living
creature, whereas the last Adam has
become a life-giving spirit.
46 Observe, the spiritual does not come
first; the physical body comes first, and
then the spiritual.1 Corinthians 15.47–54
52
47 The first man is from earth, made of
dust: the second man is from heaven.
48 The man made of dust is the pattern
of all who are made of dust, and the
heavenly man is the pattern of all the
heavenly.
49 As we have worn the likeness of the
man made of dust, so we shall wear the
likeness of the heavenly man.
50 What I mean, my friends, is this:
flesh and blood can never possess the
kingdom of God, the perishable cannot
possess the imperishable.
51 Listen! I will unfold a mystery: we
shall not all die, but we shall all be
changed
52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet-call. For the
trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise
imperishable, and we shall be changed.
53 This perishable body must be clothed
with the imperishable, and what is
mortal with immortality.
54 And when this perishable body has
been clothed with the imperishable and
our mortality has been clothed with
immortality, then the saying of scripture1 Corinthians 15.55– 16.4
53
will come true: Death is swallowed up;
victory is won!
55 O Death, where is your victory? O
Death, where is your sting?
56 The sting of death is sin, and sin
gains its power from the law.
57 But thanks be to God! He gives us
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
58 Therefore, my dear friends, stand
firm and immovable, and work for the
Lord always, work without limit, since
you know that in the Lord your labour
cannot be lost.
1 NOW ABOUT the collection in aid
of God's people: you should follow
the instructions I gave to our churches
in Galatia.
2 Every Sunday each of you is to put
aside and keep by him whatever he
can afford, so that there need be no
collecting when I come.
3 When I arrive, I will give letters of
introduction to persons approved by
you, and send them to carry your gift to
Jerusalem.
4 If it seems right for me to go as well,
they can travel with me.
161 Corinthians 16.5– 12
54
5 I shall come to Corinth after passing
through Macedonia -- for I am travelling
by way of Macedonia --
6 and I may stay some time with you,
perhaps even for the whole winter;
and then you can help me on my way
wherever I go next.
7 I do not want this to be a flying visit;
I hope to spend some time with you, if
the Lord permits.
8 But I shall remain at Ephesus until
Pentecost,
9 for a great opportunity has opened
for effective work, and there is much
opposition.
10 If Timothy comes, see that you put
him at his ease; for it is the Lord's work
that he is engaged on, as I am myself;
11 so no one must slight him. Speed him
on his way with your blessing; for he is
to join me, and I am waiting for him with
our friends.
12 As for our friend Apollos, I urged him
strongly to go to Corinth with the others,
but he was quite determined not to go
at present; he will go when the time is
right.1 Corinthians 16.13–21
55
13 Be on the alert; stand firm in the
faith; be valiant, be strong.
14 Let everything you do be done in
love.
15 One thing more, my friends. You
know that the Stephanas family were
the first converts in Achaia, and have
devoted themselves to the service of
God's people.
16 I urge you to accept the leadership of
people like them, of anyone who labours
hard at our common task.
17 It is a great pleasure to me that
Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus
have arrived, because they have done
what you had no chance to do;
18 they have raised my spirits -- and no
doubt yours too. Such people deserve
recognition.
19 Greetings from the churches of Asia.
Many greetings in the Lord from Aquila
and Prisca and the church that meets in
their house.
20 Greetings from the whole
brotherhood. Greet one another
with the kiss of peace.
21 This greeting is in my own hand --
Paul.1 Corinthians 16.22–24
56
22 If anyone does not love the Lord, let
him be outcast. Marana tha -- Come,
Lord!
23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with
you.
24 My love to you all in Christ Jesus.2 Corinthians
1 FROM Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus
1 by God's will, and our colleague
Timothy, to God's church at Corinth,
together with all God's people throughout
the whole of Achaia.
2 Grace and peace to you from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Praise be to the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the all-merciful Father,
the God whose consolation never fails
us!
4 He consoles us in all our troubles, so
that we in turn may be able to console
others in any trouble of theirs and to
share with them the consolation we
ourselves receive from God.
5 As Christ's suffering exceeds all
measure and extends to us, so too it is
through Christ that our consolation has
no limit.
6 If distress is our lot, it is the price
we pay for your consolation and your
salvation; if our lot is consolation, it is
to help us to bring you consolation, and2 Corinthians 1.7– 12
2
strength to face with fortitude the same
sufferings we now endure.
7 And our hope for you is firmly
grounded; for we know that if you share
in the suffering, you share also in the
consolation.
8 In saying this, my friends, we should
like you to know how serious was
the trouble that came upon us in the
province of Asia. The burden of it was far
too heavy for us to bear, so heavy that
we even despaired of life.
9 Indeed, we felt in our hearts that we
had received a death sentence. This was
meant to teach us to place reliance not
on ourselves, but on God who raises the
dead.
10 From such mortal peril God delivered
us; and he will deliver us again, he on
whom our hope is fixed. Yes, he will
continue to deliver us,
11 while you co-operate by praying for
us. Then, with so many people praying
for our deliverance, there will be many
to give thanks on our behalf for God's
gracious favour towards us.
12 THERE is one thing we are proud
of: our conscience shows us that in our2 Corinthians 1.13– 17
3
dealings with others, and above all in
our dealings with you, our conduct has
been governed by a devout and godly
sincerity, by the grace of God and not by
worldly wisdom.
13 There is nothing in our letters to you
but what you can read and understand.
You do understand us in some measure,
but I hope you will come to understand
fully that you have as much reason to be
proud of us, as we of you, on the day of
our Lord Jesus.
14 (1:13)
15 It was because I felt so confident
about all this that I had intended to
come first of all to you and give you the
benefit of a double visit:
16 I meant to visit you on my way to
Macedonia and, after leaving Macedonia,
to return to you, and you could then
have sent me on my way to Judaea.
17 That was my intention; did I lightly
change my mind? Or do I, when framing
my plans, frame them as a worldly man
might, first saying Yes, yes and then No,
no?2 Corinthians 1.18– 24
4
18 God is to be trusted, and therefore
what we tell you is not a mixture of Yes
and No.
19 The Son of God, Christ Jesus,
proclaimed among you by us (by
Silvanus and Timothy, I mean, as well as
myself), was not a mixture of Yes and
No. With him it is always Yes;
20 for all the promises of God have their
Yes in him. That is why, when we give
glory to God, it is through Christ Jesus
that we say Amen.
21 And if you and we belong to Christ,
guaranteed as his and anointed, it is all
God's doing;
22 it is God also who has set his seal
upon us and, as a pledge of what is to
come, has given the Spirit to dwell in our
hearts.
23 I appeal to God as my witness and
stake my life upon it: it was out of
consideration for you that I did not after
all come to Corinth.
24 It is not that we have control of your
faith; rather we are working with you
for your happiness. For it is by that faith
that you stand.2 Corinthians 2.1 –7
5
1 So I made up my mind that my
2 next visit to you must not be another
painful one.
2 If I cause pain to you, who is left to
cheer me up, except you whom I have
offended?
3 This is precisely the point I made
in my letter: I did not want, I said, to
come and be made miserable by the
very people who ought to have made me
happy; and I had sufficient confidence in
you all to know that for me to be happy
is for all of you to be happy.
4 That letter I sent you came out of
great distress and anxiety; how many
tears I shed as I wrote it! Not because
I wanted to cause you pain; rather I
wanted you to know the love, the more
than ordinary love, that I have for you.
5 Any injury that has been done has not
been done to me; to some extent (I do
not want to make too much of it) it has
been done to you all.
6 The penalty on which the general
meeting has agreed has met the offence
well enough.
7 Something very different is called for
now: you must forgive the offender and2 Corinthians 2.8– 14
6
put heart into him; the man's distress
must not be made so severe as to
overwhelm him.
8 I urge you therefore to reassure him
of your love for him.
9 I wrote, I may say, to see how
you stood the test, whether you fully
accepted my authority.
10 But anyone who has your forgiveness
has mine too; and when I speak of
forgiving (so far as there is anything
for me to forgive), I mean that as the
representative of Christ I have forgiven
him for your sake.
11 For Satan must not be allowed to get
the better of us; we know his wiles all
too well.
12 When I came to Troas, where I was to
preach the gospel of Christ, and where
an opening awaited me for serving the
Lord,
13 I still found no relief of mind, for my
colleague Titus was not there to meet
me; so I took leave of the people and
went off to Macedonia.
14 But thanks be to God, who continually
leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal
procession, and uses us to spread2 Corinthians 2.15–3.3
7
abroad the fragrance of the knowledge
of himself!
15 We are indeed the incense offered by
Christ to God, both among those who
are on the way to salvation, and among
those who are on the way to destruction:
16 to the latter it is a deadly fume that
kills, to the former a vital fragrance
that brings life. Who is equal to such a
calling?
17 We are not adulterating the word of
God for profit as so many do; when we
declare the word we do it in sincerity,
as from God and in God's sight, as
members of Christ.
1 ARE we beginning all over again to
produce our credentials? Do we, like
some people, need letters of introduction
to you, or from you?
2 No, you are all the letter we need,
a letter written on our heart; anyone
can see it for what it is and read it for
himself.
3 And as for you, it is plain that you are
a letter that has come from Christ, given
to us to deliver; a letter written not with
ink but with the Spirit of the living God,
32 Corinthians 3.4– 10
8
written not on stone tablets but on the
pages of the human heart.
4 It is in full reliance upon God, through
Christ, that we make such claims.
5 There is no question of our having
sufficient power in ourselves: we cannot
claim anything as our own. The power
we have comes from God;
6 it is he who has empowered us
as ministers of a new covenant, not
written but spiritual; for the written law
condemns to death, but the Spirit gives
life.
7 The ministry that brought death, and
that was engraved in written form on
stone, was inaugurated with such glory
that the Israelites could not keep their
eyes on Moses, even though the glory on
his face was soon to fade.
8 How much greater, then, must be the
glory of the ministry of the Spirit!
9 If glory accompanied the ministry that
brought condemnation, how much richer
in glory must be the ministry that brings
acquittal!
10 Indeed, the glory that once was is
now no glory at all; it is outshone by a
still greater glory.2 Corinthians 3.11– 18
9
11 For if what was to fade away had its
glory, how much greater is the glory of
what endures!
12 With such a hope as this we speak
out boldly;
13 it is not for us to do as Moses did:
he put a veil over his face to keep the
Israelites from gazing at the end of what
was fading away.
14 In any case their minds had become
closed, for that same veil is there to this
very day when the lesson is read from
the old covenant; and it is never lifted,
because only in Christ is it taken away.
15 Indeed to this very day, every time
the law of Moses is read, a veil lies over
the mind of the hearer.
16 But (as scripture says) Whenever he
turns to the Lord the veil is removed.
17 Now the Lord of whom this passage
speaks is the Spirit; and where the Spirit
of the Lord is, there is liberty.
18 And because for us there is no
veil over the face, we all see as in a
mirror the glory of the Lord, and we are
being transformed into his likeness with
ever-increasing glory, through the power
of the Lord who is the Spirit.2 Corinthians 4.1 –7
10
1 SINCE God in his mercy has given
4 us this ministry, we never lose heart.
2 We have renounced the deeds that
people hide for very shame; we do not
practise cunning or distort the word of
God. It is by declaring the truth openly
that we recommend ourselves to the
conscience of our fellow-men in the sight
of God.
3 If our gospel is veiled at all, it is veiled
only for those on the way to destruction;
4 their unbelieving minds are so blinded
by the god of this passing age that the
gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the
image of God, cannot dawn upon them
and bring them light.
5 It is not ourselves that we proclaim;
we proclaim Christ Jesus as Lord, and
ourselves as your servants for Jesus's
sake.
6 For the God who said, Out of darkness
light shall shine, has caused his light to
shine in our hearts, the light which is
knowledge of the glory of God in the face
of Jesus Christ.
7 But we have only earthenware jars to
hold this treasure, and this proves that2 Corinthians 4.8– 15
11
such transcendent power does not come
from us; it is God's alone.
8 We are hard pressed, but never
cornered; bewildered, but never at our
wits' end;
9 hunted, but never abandoned to our
fate; struck down, but never killed.
10 Wherever we go we carry with us in
our body the death that Jesus died, so
that in this body also the life that Jesus
lives may be revealed.
11 For Jesus's sake we are all our life
being handed over to death, so that the
life of Jesus may be revealed in this
mortal body of ours.
12 Thus death is at work in us, but life
in you.
13 But scripture says, I believed, and
therefore I spoke out, and we too, in
the same spirit of faith, believe and
therefore speak out;
14 for we know that he who raised the
Lord Jesus to life will with Jesus raise us
too, and bring us to his presence, and
you with us.
15 Indeed, all this is for your sake, so
that, as the abounding grace of God is
shared by more and more, the greater2 Corinthians 4.16–5.4
12
may be the chorus of thanksgiving that
rises to the glory of God.
16 No wonder we do not lose heart!
Though our outward humanity is in
decay, yet day by day we are inwardly
renewed.
17 Our troubles are slight and short-
lived, and their outcome is an eternal
glory which far outweighs them,
18 provided our eyes are fixed, not on
the things that are seen, but on the
things that are unseen; for what is seen
is transient, what is unseen is eternal.
1 We know that if the earthly frame
that houses us today is demolished,
we possess a building which God has
provided -- a house not made by human
hands, eternal and in heaven.
2 In this present body we groan,
yearning to be covered by our heavenly
habitation put on over this one,
3 in the hope that, being thus clothed,
we shall not find ourselves naked.
4 We groan indeed, we who are enclosed
within this earthly frame; we are
oppressed because we do not want to
have the old body stripped off. What we
want is to be covered by the new body
52 Corinthians 5.5– 12
13
put on over it, so that our mortality may
be absorbed into life immortal.
5 It is for this destiny that God himself
has been shaping us; and as a pledge of
it he has given us the Spirit.
6 Therefore we never cease to be
confident. We know that so long as we
are at home in the body we are exiles
from the Lord;
7 faith is our guide, not sight.
8 We are confident, I say, and would
rather be exiled from the body and make
our home with the Lord.
9 That is why it is our ambition,
wherever we are, at home or in exile, to
be acceptable to him.
10 For we must all have our lives laid
open before the tribunal of Christ, where
each must receive what is due to him for
his conduct in the body, good or bad.
11 WITH this fear of the Lord before our
eyes we address our appeal to men and
women. To God our lives lie open, and I
hope that in your heart of hearts they lie
open to you also.
12 This is not another attempt to
recommend ourselves to you: we are
rather giving you a chance to show2 Corinthians 5.13– 18
14
yourselves proud of us; then you will
have something to say to those whose
pride is all in outward show and not in
inward worth.
13 If these are mad words, take them
as addressed to God; if sound sense, as
addressed to you.
14 For the love of Christ controls us once
we have reached the conclusion that
one man died for all and therefore all
mankind has died.
15 He died for all so that those who live
should cease to live for themselves, and
should live for him who for their sake
died and was raised to life.
16 With us therefore worldly standards
have ceased to count in our estimate of
anyone; even if once they counted in our
understanding of Christ, they do so now
no longer.
17 For anyone united to Christ, there is
a new creation: the old order has gone;
a new order has already begun.
18 All this has been the work of God.
He has reconciled us to himself through
Christ, and has enlisted us in this
ministry of reconciliation:2 Corinthians 5.19–6.4
15
19 God was in Christ reconciling the
world to himself, no longer holding
people's misdeeds against them, and
has entrusted us with the message of
reconciliation.
20 We are therefore Christ's
ambassadors. It is as if God were
appealing to you through us: we implore
you in Christ's name, be reconciled to
God!
21 Christ was innocent of sin, and yet for
our sake God made him one with human
sinfulness, so that in him we might be
made one with the righteousness of God.
1 Sharing in God's work, we make
this appeal: you have received the
grace of God; do not let it come to
nothing.
2 He has said: In the hour of my favour I
answered you; on the day of deliverance
I came to your aid. This is the hour of
favour, this the day of deliverance.
3 Lest our ministry be brought into
discredit, we avoid giving any offence in
anything.
4 As God's ministers, we try
to recommend ourselves in all
circumstances by our steadfast
62 Corinthians 6.5– 13
16
endurance: in affliction, hardship, and
distress;
5 when flogged, imprisoned, mobbed;
overworked, sleepless, starving.
6 We recommend ourselves by innocent
behaviour and grasp of truth, by patience
and kindliness, by gifts of the Holy Spirit,
by unaffected love,
7 by declaring the truth, by the power
of God. We wield the weapons of
righteousness in right hand and left.
8 Honour and dishonour, praise and
blame, are alike our lot: we are the
impostors who speak the truth,
9 the unknown men whom all men
know; dying we still live on; disciplined
by suffering, we are not done to death;
10 in our sorrows we have always cause
for joy; poor ourselves, we bring wealth
to many; penniless, we own the world.
11 We have spoken very frankly to you,
friends in Corinth; we have opened our
heart to you.
12 There is no constraint on our part;
any constraint there may be is in you.
13 In fair exchange then (if I may speak
to you like a father) open your hearts to
us.2 Corinthians 6.14–7.2
17
14 DO NOT team up with unbelievers.
What partnership can righteousness have
with wickedness? Can light associate
with darkness?
15 Can Christ agree with Belial, or a
believer join with an unbeliever?
16 Can there be a compact between the
temple of God and idols? And the temple
of the living God is what we are. God's
own words are: I will live and move
about among them; I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.
17 And therefore, Come away and leave
them, separate yourselves, says the
Lord; touch nothing unclean. Then I will
accept you,
18 says the Lord Almighty; I will be a
father to you, and you shall be my sons
and daughters.
1 Such are the promises that have
been made to us, dear friends. Let us
therefore cleanse ourselves from all that
can defile flesh or spirit and, in the fear
of God, let us complete our consecration.
2 MAKE a place for us in your hearts!
We have wronged no one, ruined no one,
exploited no one.
72 Corinthians 7.3 –9
18
3 My words are no reflection on you. I
have told you before that, come death,
come life, your place in our hearts is
secure.
4 I am speaking to you with great
frankness, but my pride in you is just as
great. In all our many troubles my cup
is full of consolation and overflows with
joy.
5 Even when we reached Macedonia we
still found no relief; instead trouble met
us at every turn, fights without and fears
within.
6 But God, who brings comfort to the
downcast, has comforted us by the
arrival of Titus,
7 and not merely by his arrival, but by
his being so greatly encouraged about
you. He has told us how you long for
me, how sorry you are, and how eager
to take my side; and that has made me
happier still.
8 Even if I did hurt you by the letter I
sent, I do not now regret it. I did regret
it; but now that I see the letter gave you
pain, though only for a time,
9 I am happy -- not because of the pain
but because the pain led to a change of2 Corinthians 7.10– 13
19
heart. You bore the pain as God would
have you bear it, and so you came to no
harm from what we did.
10 Pain borne in God's way brings no
regrets but a change of heart leading to
salvation; pain borne in the world's way
brings death.
11 You bore your pain in God's way, and
just look at the results: it made you
take the matter seriously and vindicate
yourselves; it made you indignant and
apprehensive; it aroused your longing for
me, your devotion, and your eagerness
to see justice done! At every point you
have cleared yourselves of blame.
12 And so, although I did send you that
letter, it was not the offender or his
victim that most concerned me. My aim
in writing was to help to make plain to
you, in the sight of God, how truly you
are devoted to us.
13 That is why we have been so
encouraged. But besides being
encouraged ourselves, we have also
been delighted beyond everything by
seeing how happy Titus is: you have
all helped to set his mind completely at
rest.2 Corinthians 7.14–8.4
20
14 Anything I may have said to him to
show my pride in you has been justified.
Every word we addressed to you bore
the mark of truth, and the same holds of
the proud boast we made in the presence
of Titus; that also has proved true.
15 His heart warms all the more to you
as he recalls how ready you all were to
do what he asked, meeting him as you
did in fear and trembling.
16 How happy I am now to have
complete confidence in you!
1 WE must tell you, friends, about
the grace that God has given to the
churches in Macedonia.
2 The troubles they have been through
have tried them hard, yet in all this
they have been so exuberantly happy
that from the depths of their poverty
they have shown themselves lavishly
open-handed.
3 Going to the limit of their resources,
as I can testify, and even beyond that
limit,
4 they begged us most insistently, and
on their own initiative, to be allowed to
share in this generous service to their
fellow-Christians.
82 Corinthians 8.5– 11
21
5 And their giving surpassed our
expectations; for first of all they gave
themselves to the Lord and, under God,
to us.
6 The upshot is that we have asked
Titus, since he has already made a
beginning, to bring your share in this
further work of generosity also to
completion.
7 You are so rich in everything -- in
faith, speech, knowledge, and diligence
of every kind, as well as in the love you
have for us -- that you should surely
show yourselves equally lavish in this
generous service!
8 This is not meant as an order; by
telling you how keen others are I am
putting your love to the test.
9 You know the generosity of our Lord
Jesus Christ: he was rich, yet for your
sake he became poor, so that through
his poverty you might become rich.
10 Here is my advice, and I have your
interests at heart. You made a good
beginning last year both in what you did
and in your willingness to do it.
11 Now go on and finish it. Be as eager
to complete the scheme as you were2 Corinthians 8.12– 19
22
to adopt it, and give according to your
means.
12 If we give eagerly according to our
means, that is acceptable to God; he
does not ask for what we do not have.
13 There is no question of relieving
others at the cost of hardship to
yourselves;
14 it is a question of equality. At the
moment your surplus meets their need,
but one day your need may be met from
their surplus. The aim is equality;
15 as scripture has it, Those who
gathered more did not have too much,
and those who gathered less did not
have too little.
16 I thank God that he has made Titus
as keen on your behalf as we are!
17 So keen is he that he not only
welcomed our request; it is by his own
choice he is now leaving to come to you.
18 With him we are sending one of
our company whose reputation for his
services to the gospel among all the
churches is high.
19 Moreover they have duly appointed
him to travel with us and help in this
beneficent work, by which we do honour2 Corinthians 8.20–9.2
23
to the Lord himself and show our own
eagerness to serve.
20 We want to guard against any
criticism of our handling of these large
sums;
21 for our aims are entirely honourable,
not only in the Lord's eyes, but also in
the eyes of men and women.
22 We are sending with them another
of our company whose enthusiasm we
have had repeated opportunities of
testing, and who is now all the more
keen because of the great confidence he
has in you.
23 If there is any question about Titus,
he is my partner and my fellow-worker
in dealings with you; as for the others,
they are delegates of the churches and
bring honour to Christ.
24 So give them, and through them the
churches, clear evidence of your love
and justify our pride in you.
1 About this aid for God's people, it is
superfluous for me to write to you.
2 I know how eager you are to help
and I speak of it with pride to the
Macedonians, telling them that Achaia
had everything ready last year; and
92 Corinthians 9.3 –8
24
most of them have been fired by your
zeal.
3 My purpose in sending these friends is
to ensure that what we have said about
you in this matter should not prove to
be an empty boast. I want you to be
prepared, as I told them you were;
4 for if I bring men from Macedonia with
me and they find you are not prepared,
what a disgrace it will be to us, let alone
to you, after all the confidence we have
shown!
5 I have accordingly thought it
necessary to ask these friends to go
on ahead to Corinth, to see that your
promised bounty is in order before I
come; it will then be awaiting me as
genuine bounty, and not as an extortion.
6 Remember: sow sparingly, and you
will reap sparingly; sow bountifully, and
you will reap bountifully.
7 Each person should give as he has
decided for himself; there should be no
reluctance, no sense of compulsion; God
loves a cheerful giver.
8 And it is in God's power to provide you
with all good gifts in abundance, so that,
with every need always met to the full,2 Corinthians 9.9– 14
25
you may have something to spare for
every good cause;
9 as scripture says: He lavishes his gifts
on the needy; his benevolence lasts for
ever.
10 Now he who provides seed for sowing
and bread for food will provide the seed
for you to sow; he will multiply it and
swell the harvest of your benevolence,
11 and you will always be rich enough to
be generous. Through our action such
generosity will issue in thanksgiving to
God,
12 for as a piece of willing service this
is not only a contribution towards the
needs of God's people; more than that,
it overflows in a flood of thanksgiving to
God.
13 For with the proof which this aid
affords, those who receive it will give
honour to God when they see how
humbly you obey him and how faithfully
you confess the gospel of Christ; and
they will thank him for your liberal
contribution to their need and to the
general good.
14 And as they join in prayer on your
behalf, their hearts will go out to you2 Corinthians 9.15–10.5
26
because of the richness of the grace
which God has given you.
15 Thanks be to God for his gift which is
beyond all praise!
1 (I, PAUL), appeal to you by
the gentleness and magnanimity
of Christ -- I who am so timid (you
say) when face to face with you, so
courageous when I am away from you.
2 Spare me when I come, I beg
you, the need for that courage and
self-assurance, which I reckon I could
confidently display against those who
assume my behaviour to be dictated by
human weakness.
3 Weak and human we may be, but that
does not dictate the way we fight our
battles.
4 The weapons we wield are not merely
human; they are strong enough with
God's help to demolish strongholds.
5 We demolish sophistries and all
that rears its proud head against
the knowledge of God; we compel
every human thought to surrender in
obedience to Christ;
102 Corinthians 10.6– 12
27
6 and we are prepared to punish any
disobedience once your own obedience
is complete.
7 Look facts in the face. Is someone
convinced that he belongs to Christ?
Let him think again and reflect that we
belong to Christ as much as he does.
8 Indeed, if I am boasting too much
about our authority -- an authority given
by the Lord to build your faith, not pull it
down -- I shall make good my boast.
9 So you must not think of me as one
who tries to scare you by the letters he
writes.
10 His letters, so it is said, are weighty
and powerful; but when he is present he
is unimpressive, and as a speaker he is
beneath contempt.
11 People who talk in that way should
reckon with this: my actions when I
come will show the same man as my
letters showed while I was absent.
12 We should not dare to class ourselves
or compare ourselves with any of those
who commend themselves. What fools
they are to measure themselves on their
own, to find in themselves their standard
of comparison!2 Corinthians 10.13–18
28
13 As for us, our boasting will not go
beyond the proper limits; and our sphere
is determined by the limit God laid down
for us, which permitted us to come as
far as Corinth.
14 We are not overstretching our
commission, as we would be if we had
never come to you; but we were the first
to reach as far as Corinth in the work of
the gospel of Christ.
15 And we do not boast of work done
where others have laboured, work
beyond our proper sphere. Our hope is
rather that, as your faith grows, we may
attain a position among you greater than
ever before, but still within the limits of
our sphere.
16 Then we can carry the gospel to
lands that lie beyond you, never priding
ourselves on work already done in
anyone else's sphere.
17 If anyone would boast, let him boast
of the Lord.
18 For it is not the one who recommends
himself, but the one whom the Lord
recommends, who is to be accepted.2 Corinthians 11.1– 7
29
1 I SHOULD like you to bear with
11 me in a little foolishness; please
bear with me.
2 I am jealous for you, with the jealousy
of God; for I betrothed you to Christ,
thinking to present you as a chaste virgin
to her true and only husband.
3 Now I am afraid that, as the serpent in
his cunning seduced Eve, your thoughts
may be corrupted and you may lose your
single-hearted devotion to Christ.
4 For if some newcomer proclaims
another Jesus, not the Jesus whom we
proclaimed, or if you receive a spirit
different from the Spirit already given
to you, or a gospel different from the
gospel you have already accepted, you
put up with that well enough.
5 I am not aware of being in any way
inferior to those super-apostles.
6 I may be no speaker, but knowledge
I do have; at all times we have made
known to you the full truth.
7 Or was this my offence, that I made
no charge for preaching the gospel of
God, humbling myself in order to exalt
you?2 Corinthians 11.8– 16
30
8 I robbed other churches -- by
accepting support from them to serve
you.
9 If I ran short while I was with you,
I did not become a charge on anyone;
my needs were fully met by friends from
Macedonia; I made it a rule, as I always
shall, never to be a burden to you.
10 As surely as the truth of Christ is in
me, nothing shall bar me from boasting
about this throughout Achaia.
11 Why? Because I do not love you? God
knows I do.
12 And I shall go on doing as I am doing
now, to cut the ground from under those
who would seize any chance to put their
vaunted apostleship on the same level
as ours.
13 Such people are sham apostles,
confidence tricksters masquerading as
apostles of Christ.
14 And no wonder! Satan himself
masquerades as an angel of light,
15 so it is easy enough for his agents to
masquerade as agents of good. But their
fate will match their deeds.
16 I repeat: let no one take me for a
fool; but if you must, then give me the2 Corinthians 11.17–25
31
privilege of a fool, and let me have my
little boast like others.
17 In boasting so confidently I am not
speaking like a Christian, but like a fool.
18 So many people brag of their earthly
distinctions that I shall do so too.
19 How gladly you put up with fools,
being yourselves so wise!
20 If someone tyrannizes over you,
exploits you, gets you in his clutches,
puts on airs, and hits you in the face,
you put up with it.
21 And you call me a weakling! I admit
the reproach. But if there is to be
bravado (and I am still speaking as a
fool), I can indulge in it too.
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I.
Israelites? So am I. Abraham's
descendants? So am I.
23 Are they servants of Christ? I am mad
to speak like this, but I can outdo them:
more often overworked, more often
imprisoned, scourged more severely,
many a time face to face with death.
24 Five times the Jews have given me
the thirty-nine strokes;
25 three times I have been beaten
with rods; once I was stoned; three2 Corinthians 11.26–31
32
times I have been shipwrecked, and for
twenty-four hours I was adrift on the
open sea.
26 I have been constantly on the
road; I have met dangers from rivers,
dangers from robbers, dangers from
my fellow-countrymen, dangers from
foreigners, dangers in the town, dangers
in the wilderness, dangers at sea,
dangers from false Christians.
27 I have toiled and drudged and often
gone without sleep; I have been hungry
and thirsty and have often gone without
food; I have suffered from cold and
exposure.
28 Apart from these external things,
there is the responsibility that weighs on
me every day, my anxious concern for
all the churches.
29 Is anyone weak? I share his
weakness. If anyone brings about the
downfall of another, does my heart not
burn with anger?
30 If boasting there must be, I will boast
of the things that show up my weakness.
31 He who is blessed for ever, the God
and Father of the Lord Jesus, knows that
what I say is true.2 Corinthians 11.32– 12.6
33
32 When I was in Damascus, the
commissioner of King Aretas kept the
city under observation to have me
arrested;
33 and I was let down in a basket,
through a window in the wall, and so
escaped his clutches.
1 IT may do no good, but I must
go on with my boasting; I come
now to visions and revelations granted
by the Lord.
2 I know a Christian man who fourteen
years ago (whether in the body or out of
the body, I do not know -- God knows)
was caught up as far as the third heaven.
3 And I know that this same man
(whether in the body or apart from the
body, I do not know -- God knows)
4 was caught up into paradise, and
heard words so secret that human lips
may not repeat them.
5 About such a man I am ready to
boast; but I will not boast on my own
account, except of my weaknesses.
6 If I chose to boast, it would not be the
boast of a fool, for I should be speaking
the truth. But I refrain, because I do not
want anyone to form an estimate of me
122 Corinthians 12.7– 12
34
which goes beyond the evidence of his
own eyes and ears.
7 To keep me from being unduly elated
by the magnificence of such revelations,
I was given a thorn in my flesh, a
messenger of Satan sent to buffet me;
this was to save me from being unduly
elated.
8 Three times I begged the Lord to rid
me of it,
9 but his answer was: My grace is all
you need; power is most fully seen in
weakness. I am therefore happy to boast
of my weaknesses, because then the
power of Christ will rest upon me.
10 So I am content with a life of
weakness, insult, hardship, persecution,
and distress, all for Christ's sake; for
when I am weak, then I am strong.
11 I AM being very foolish, but it
was you who drove me to it; my
credentials should have come from you.
In nothing did I prove inferior to those
super-apostles, even if I am a nobody.
12 The signs of an apostle were there in
the work I did among you, marked by
unfailing endurance, by signs, portents,
and miracles.2 Corinthians 12.13–19
35
13 Is there any way in which you were
treated worse than the other churches --
except this, that I was never a charge on
you? Forgive me for being so unfair!
14 I am now getting ready to pay you a
third visit; and I am not going to be a
charge on you. It is you I want, not your
money; parents should make provision
for their children, not children for their
parents.
15 I would gladly spend everything for
you -- yes, and spend myself to the limit.
If I love you overmuch, am I to be loved
the less?
16 All very well, you say; I did not
myself prove a burden to you, but I did
use a confidence trick to take you in.
17 Was it one of the men I sent to you
that I used to exploit you?
18 I begged Titus to visit you, and I sent
our friend with him. Did Titus exploit
you? Have we not both been guided by
the same Spirit, and followed the same
course?
19 Perhaps you have been thinking
all this time that it is to you we
are addressing our defence. No; we
are speaking in God's sight, and as2 Corinthians 12.20– 13.3
36
Christians. Our whole aim, dear friends,
is to build you up.
20 I fear that when I come I may find
you different from what I wish, and you
may find me to be what you do not wish.
I fear I may find quarrelling and jealousy,
angry tempers and personal rivalries,
backbiting and gossip, arrogance and
general disorder.
21 I am afraid that when I come my
God may humiliate me again in your
presence, that I may have cause to
grieve over many who were sinning
before and have not repented of their
unclean lives, their fornication and
sensuality.
1 This will be my third visit to you.
As scripture says, Every charge
must be established on the evidence of
two or three witnesses:
2 to those who sinned before, and to
everyone else, I repeat the warning I
gave last time; on my second visit I
gave it in person, and now I give it while
absent. It is that when I come this time,
I will show no leniency.
3 Then you will have the proof you seek
of the Christ who speaks through me,
132 Corinthians 13.4– 10
37
the Christ who, far from being weak with
you, makes his power felt among you.
4 True, he died on the cross in weakness,
but he lives by the power of God; so you
will find that we who share his weakness
shall live with him by the power of God.
5 Examine yourselves: are you living the
life of faith? Put yourselves to the test.
Surely you recognize that Jesus Christ is
among you? If not, you have failed the
test.
6 I hope you will come to see that we
have not failed.
7 Our prayer to God is that you may
do no wrong, not that we should win
approval; we want you to do what is
right, even if we should seem failures.
8 We have no power to act against the
truth, but only for it.
9 We are happy to be weak at any time
if only you are strong. Our prayer, then,
is for your amendment.
10 In writing this letter before I come,
my aim is to spare myself, when I do
come, any sharp exercise of authority
-- authority which the Lord gave me for
building up and not for pulling down.2 Corinthians 13.11–14
38
11 And now, my friends, farewell. Mend
your ways; take our appeal to heart;
agree with one another; live in peace;
and the God of love and peace will be
with you.
12 Greet one another with the kiss of
peace.
13 All God's people send you greetings.
14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God, and the fellowship
of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.Galatians
1 FROM
Paul, an apostle
commissioned not by any human
authority or human act, but by Jesus
Christ and God the Father who raised
him from the dead.
2 I and all the friends now with me send
greetings to the churches of Galatia.
3 Grace to you and peace from God the
Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
4 who gave himself for our sins, to
rescue us out of the present wicked age
as our God and Father willed;
5 to him be glory for ever and ever!
Amen.
6 I AM astonished to find you turning
away so quickly from him who called
you by grace, and following a different
gospel.
7 Not that it is in fact another gospel;
only there are some who unsettle your
minds by trying to distort the gospel of
Christ.
8 But should anyone, even I myself or
an angel from heaven, preach a gospel
1Galatians 1.9–15
2
other than the gospel I preached to you,
let him be banned!
9 I warned you in the past and now
I warn you again: if anyone preaches
a gospel other than the gospel you
received, let him be banned!
10 Now do I sound as if I were asking
for human approval and not for God's
alone? Am I currying favour with men?
If I were still seeking human favour, I
should be no servant of Christ.
11 I must make it clear to you, my
friends, that the gospel you heard me
preach is not of human origin.
12 I did not take it over from anyone; no
one taught it me; I received it through a
revelation of Jesus Christ.
13 You have heard what my manner of
life was when I was still a practising Jew:
how savagely I persecuted the church of
God and tried to destroy it;
14 and how in the practice of our
national religion I outstripped most
of my Jewish contemporaries by my
boundless devotion to the traditions of
my ancestors.
15 But then in his good pleasure God,
who from my birth had set me apart, andGalatians 1.16–24
3
who had called me through his grace,
chose
16 to reveal his Son in and through
me, in order that I might proclaim
him among the Gentiles. Immediately,
without consulting a single person,
17 without going up to Jerusalem to
see those who were apostles before me,
I went off to Arabia, and afterwards
returned to Damascus.
18 Three years later I did go up to
Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I
stayed two weeks with him.
19 I saw none of the other apostles,
except James, the Lord's brother.
20 What I write is plain truth; God
knows I am not lying!
21 Then I left for the regions of Syria
and Cilicia.
22 I was still unknown by sight to the
Christian congregations in Judaea;
23 they had simply heard it said, Our
former persecutor is preaching the good
news of the faith which once he tried to
destroy,
24 and they praised God for what had
happened to me.Galatians 2.1–6
4
1 Fourteen years later, I went up
2 again to Jerusalem with Barnabas,
and we took Titus with us.
2 I went in response to a revelation from
God; I explained, at a private interview
with those of repute, the gospel which
I preach to the Gentiles, to make sure
that the race I had run and was running
should not be in vain.
3 Not even my companion Titus, Greek
though he is, was compelled to be
circumcised.
4 That course was urged only as a
concession to certain sham Christians,
intruders who had sneaked in to spy on
the liberty we enjoy in the fellowship of
Christ Jesus. These men wanted to bring
us into bondage,
5 but not for one moment did I yield to
their dictation; I was determined that
the full truth of the gospel should be
maintained for you.
6 As for those reputed to be something
(not that their importance matters
to me: God does not recognize these
personal distinctions) -- these men of
repute, I say, imparted nothing further
to me.Galatians 2.7–13
5
7 On the contrary, they saw that I had
been entrusted to take the gospel to
the Gentiles as surely as Peter had been
entrusted to take it to the Jews;
8 for the same God who was at work in
Peter's mission to the Jews was also at
work in mine to the Gentiles.
9 Recognizing, then, the privilege
bestowed on me, those who are reputed
to be pillars of the community, James,
Cephas, and John, accepted Barnabas
and myself as partners and shook hands
on it: the agreement was that we should
go to the Gentiles, while they went to
the Jews.
10 All they asked was that we should
keep in mind the poor, the very thing I
have always made it my business to do.
11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I
opposed him to his face, because he was
clearly in the wrong.
12 For until some messengers came
from James, he was taking his meals
with gentile Christians; but after they
came he drew back and began to hold
aloof, because he was afraid of the Jews.
13 The other Jewish Christians showed
the same lack of principle; evenGalatians 2.14–18
6
Barnabas was carried away and played
false like the rest.
14 But when I saw that their conduct did
not square with the truth of the gospel,
I said to Cephas in front of the whole
congregation, If you, a Jew born and
bred, live like a Gentile, and not like a
Jew, how can you insist that Gentiles
must live like Jews?
15 We ourselves are Jews by birth, not
gentile sinners;
16 yet we know that no one is ever
justified by doing what the law requires,
but only through faith in Christ Jesus.
So we too have put our faith in Jesus
Christ, in order that we might be justified
through this faith, and not through
actions dictated by law; for no human
being can be justified by keeping the
law.
17 If then, in seeking to be justified in
Christ, we ourselves no less than the
Gentiles turn out to be sinners, does that
mean that Christ is a promoter of sin? Of
course not!
18 On the contrary, it is only if I start
building up again all I have pulled downGalatians 2.19–3.5
7
that I prove to be one who breaks the
law.
19 For through the law I died to law --
to live for God.
20 I have been crucified with Christ: the
life I now live is not my life, but the life
which Christ lives in me; and my present
mortal life is lived by faith in the Son of
God, who loved me and gave himself up
for me.
21 I will not nullify the grace of God; if
righteousness comes by law, then Christ
died for nothing.
1 YOU STUPID Galatians! You must
have been bewitched -- you before
whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly
displayed on the cross!
2 Answer me one question: did you
receive the Spirit by keeping the law or
by believing the gospel message?
3 Can you really be so stupid? You
started with the spiritual; do you now
look to the material to make you perfect?
4 Is all you have experienced to come to
nothing -- surely not!
5 When God gives you the Spirit and
works miracles among you, is it because
3Galatians 3.6–12
8
you keep the law, or is it because you
have faith in the gospel message?
6 Look at Abraham: he put his faith in
God, and that faith was counted to him
as righteousness.
7 You may take it, then, that it is those
who have faith who are Abraham's sons.
8 And scripture, foreseeing that God
would justify the Gentiles through
faith, declared the gospel to Abraham
beforehand: In you all nations shall find
blessing.
9 Thus it is those with faith who share
the blessing with faithful Abraham.
10 On the other hand, those who rely
on obedience to the law are under a
curse; for scripture says, Cursed is
everyone who does not persevere in
doing everything that is written in the
book of the law.
11 It is evident that no one is ever
justified before God by means of the law,
because we read, He shall gain life who
is justified through faith.
12 Now the law does not operate on the
basis of faith, for we read, He who does
this shall gain life by what he does.Galatians 3.13–18
9
13 Christ bought us freedom from the
curse of the law by coming under the
curse for our sake; for scripture says,
Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a
gibbet.
14 The purpose of this was that the
blessing of Abraham should in Jesus
Christ be extended to the Gentiles, so
that we might receive the promised
Spirit through faith.
15 My friends, let me give you an
illustration. When a man's will and
testament has been duly executed, no
one else can set it aside or add a codicil.
16 Now, the promises were pronounced
to Abraham and to his issue. It does not
say issues in the plural, but your issue
in the singular; and by issue is meant
Christ.
17 My point is this: a testament, or
covenant, had already been validated by
God; a law made four hundred and thirty
years later cannot invalidate it and so
render its promises ineffective.
18 If the inheritance is by legal right,
then it is not by promise; but it was by
promise that God bestowed it as a free
gift on Abraham.Galatians 3.19–26
10
19 Then what of the law? It was added
to make wrongdoing a legal offence; it
was an interim measure pending the
arrival of the issue to whom the promise
was made. It was promulgated through
angels, and there was an intermediary;
20 but an intermediary is not needed for
one party acting alone, and God is one.
21 Does the law, then, contradict the
promises? Of course not! If a law had
been given which had power to bestow
life, then righteousness would indeed
have come from keeping the law.
22 But scripture has declared the whole
world to be prisoners in subjection to
sin, so that faith in Jesus Christ should
be the ground on which the promised
blessing is given to those who believe.
23 Before this faith came, we were close
prisoners in the custody of law, pending
the revelation of faith.
24 The law was thus put in charge of
us until Christ should come, when we
should be justified through faith;
25 and now that faith has come, its
charge is at an end.
26 It is through faith that you are all
sons of God in union with Christ Jesus.Galatians 3.27–4.6
11
27 Baptized into union with him, you
have all put on Christ like a garment.
28 There is no such thing as Jew and
Greek, slave and freeman, male and
female; for you are all one person in
Christ Jesus.
29 So if you belong to Christ, you are
the issue of Abraham and heirs by virtue
of the promise.
1 THIS is what I mean: so long as
the heir is a minor, he is no better
off than a slave, even though the whole
estate is his;
2 he is subject to guardians and trustees
until the date set by his father.
3 So it was with us: during our minority
we were slaves, subject to the elemental
spirits of the universe,
4 but when the appointed time came,
God sent his Son, born of a woman, born
under the law,
5 to buy freedom for those who were
under the law, in order that we might
attain the status of sons.
6 To prove that you are sons, God has
sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son,
crying Abba, Father!
4Galatians 4.7–14
12
7 You are therefore no longer a slave
but a son, and if a son, an heir by God's
own act.
8 Formerly, when you did not know God,
you were slaves to gods who are not
gods at all.
9 But now that you do acknowledge
God -- or rather, now that he has
acknowledged you -- how can you
turn back to those feeble and bankrupt
elemental spirits? Why do you propose
to enter their service all over again?
10 You keep special days and months
and seasons and years.
11 I am afraid that all my hard work on
you may have been wasted.
12 PUT yourselves in my place, my
friends, I beg you, as I put myself in
yours. You never did me any wrong:
13 it was bodily illness, as you will
remember, that originally led to my
bringing you the gospel,
14 and you resisted any temptation to
show scorn or disgust at my physical
condition; on the contrary you welcomed
me as if I were an angel of God, as
you might have welcomed Christ Jesus
himself.Galatians 4.15–23
13
15 What has become of the happiness
you felt then? I believe you would have
torn out your eyes and given them to
me, had that been possible!
16 Have I now made myself your enemy
by being frank with you?
17 Others are lavishing attention on you,
but without sincerity: what they really
want is to isolate you so that you may
lavish attention on them.
18 To be the object of sincere attentions
is always good, and not just when I am
with you.
19 You are my own children, and I am in
labour with you all over again until you
come to have the form of Christ.
20 How I wish I could be with you now,
for then I could modify my tone; as it is,
I am at my wits' end about you.
21 TELL me now, you that are so anxious
to be under law, will you not listen to
what the law says?
22 It is written there that Abraham had
two sons, the one by a slave, the other
by a free-born woman.
23 The slave's son was born in the
ordinary course of nature, but the free
woman's through God's promise.Galatians 4.24–31
14
24 This is an allegory: the two women
stand for two covenants. The one
covenant comes from Mount Sinai; that
is Hagar, and her children are born into
slavery.
25 Sinai is a mountain in Arabia and
represents the Jerusalem of today, for
she and her children are in slavery.
26 But the heavenly Jerusalem is the
free woman; she is our mother.
27 For scripture says, Rejoice, O barren
woman who never bore a child; break
into a shout of joy, you who have never
been in labour; for the deserted wife will
have more children than she who lives
with her husband.
28 Now you, my friends, like Isaac, are
children of God's promise,
29 but just as in those days the
natural-born son persecuted the spiritual
son, so it is today.
30 Yet what does scripture say? Drive
out the slave and her son, for the son of
the slave shall not share the inheritance
with the son of the free woman.
31 You see, then, my friends, we are no
slave's children; our mother is the free
woman.Galatians 5.1–9
15
1 It is for freedom that Christ set
5 us free. Stand firm, therefore, and
refuse to submit again to the yoke of
slavery.
2 Mark my words: I, Paul, say to you
that if you get yourself circumcised
Christ will benefit you no more.
3 I impress on you once again that
every man who accepts circumcision is
under obligation to keep the entire law.
4 When you seek to be justified by way
of law, you are cut off from Christ: you
have put yourselves outside God's grace.
5 For it is by the Spirit and through faith
that we hope to attain that righteousness
which we eagerly await.
6 If we are in union with Christ Jesus,
circumcision makes no difference at all,
nor does the lack of it; the only thing
that counts is faith expressing itself
through love.
7 You were running well; who was it
hindered you from following the truth?
8 Whatever persuasion was used, it did
not come from God who called you.
9 A little leaven, remember, leavens all
the dough.Galatians 5.10–17
16
10 The Lord gives me confidence that
you will not adopt the wrong view; but
whoever it is who is unsettling your
minds must bear God's judgement.
11 As for me, my friends, if I am still
advocating circumcision, then why am I
still being persecuted? To do that would
be to strip the cross of all offence.
12 Those agitators had better go
the whole way and make eunuchs of
themselves!
13 (YOU, MY) friends, were called to
be free; only beware of turning your
freedom into licence for your unspiritual
nature. Instead, serve one another in
love;
14 for the whole law is summed up
in a single commandment: Love your
neighbour as yourself.
15 But if you go on fighting one another,
tooth and nail, all you can expect is
mutual destruction.
16 What I mean is this: be guided by the
Spirit and you will not gratify the desires
of your unspiritual nature.
17 That nature sets its desires against
the Spirit, while the Spirit fights againstGalatians 5.18–25
17
it. They are in conflict with one another
so that you cannot do what you want.
18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you
are not subject to law.
19 Anyone can see the behaviour that
belongs to the unspiritual nature:
fornication, indecency, and debauchery;
20 idolatry and sorcery; quarrels, a
contentious temper, envy, fits of rage,
selfish ambitions, dissensions, party
intrigues,
21 and jealousies; drinking bouts,
orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I
warned you before, that no one who
behaves like that will ever inherit the
kingdom of God.
22 But the harvest of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, fidelity,
23 gentleness, and self-control. Against
such things there is no law.
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus
have crucified the old nature with its
passions and desires.
25 If the Spirit is the source of our life,
let the Spirit also direct its course.Galatians 5.26–6.8
18
26 We must not be conceited, inciting
one another to rivalry, jealous of one
another.
1 If anyone is caught doing something
wrong, you, my friends, who live by
the Spirit must gently set him right. Look
to yourself, each one of you: you also
may be tempted.
2 Carry one another's burdens, and in
this way you will fulfil the law of Christ.
3 If anyone imagines himself to be
somebody when he is nothing, he is
deluding himself.
4 Each of you should examine his own
conduct, and then he can measure his
achievement by comparing himself with
himself and not with anyone else;
5 for everyone has his own burden to
bear.
6 When anyone is under instruction in
the faith, he should give his teacher a
share of whatever good things he has.
7 Make no mistake about this: God is
not to be fooled; everyone reaps what
he sows.
8 If he sows in the field of his unspiritual
nature, he will reap from it a harvest of
corruption; but if he sows in the field of
6Galatians 6.9–15
19
the Spirit, he will reap from it a harvest
of eternal life.
9 Let us never tire of doing good, for if
we do not slacken our efforts we shall in
due time reap our harvest.
10 Therefore, as opportunity offers, let
us work for the good of all, especially
members of the household of the faith.
11 LOOK how big the letters are, now
that I am writing to you in my own hand.
12 It is those who want to be outwardly
in good standing who are trying to force
circumcision on you; their sole object is
to escape persecution for the cross of
Christ.
13 Even those who do accept
circumcision are not thoroughgoing
observers of the law; they want you to
be circumcised just in order to boast of
your submission to that outward rite.
14 God forbid that I should boast of
anything but the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, through which the world is
crucified to me and I to the world!
15 Circumcision is nothing;
uncircumcision is nothing; the only
thing that counts is new creation!Galatians 6.16–18
20
16 All who take this principle for their
guide, peace and mercy be upon them,
the Israel of God!
17 In future let no one make trouble
for me, for I bear the marks of Jesus
branded on my body.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you, my friends. Amen.Ephesians
1 FROM Paul, by the will of God
1 apostle of Christ Jesus, to God's
people at Ephesus, to the faithful,
incorporate in Christ Jesus.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 BLESSED be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has conferred
on us in Christ every spiritual blessing in
the heavenly realms.
4 Before the foundation of the world he
chose us in Christ to be his people, to be
without blemish in his sight, to be full of
love;
5 and he predestined us to be adopted
as his children through Jesus Christ. This
was his will and pleasure
6 in order that the glory of his gracious
gift, so graciously conferred on us in his
Beloved, might redound to his praise.
7 In Christ our release is secured and
our sins forgiven through the shedding
of his blood. In the richness of his graceEphesians 1.8–15
2
8 God has lavished on us all wisdom and
insight.
9 He has made known to us his secret
purpose, in accordance with the plan
which he determined beforehand in
Christ,
10 to be put into effect when the time
was ripe: namely, that the universe,
everything in heaven and on earth,
might be brought into a unity in Christ.
11 In Christ indeed we have been
given our share in the heritage, as was
decreed in his design whose purpose is
everywhere at work; for it was his will
12 that we, who were the first to set our
hope on Christ, should cause his glory to
be praised.
13 And in Christ you also -- once you
had heard the message of the truth, the
good news of your salvation, and had
believed it -- in him you were stamped
with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit;
14 and that Spirit is a pledge of the
inheritance which will be ours when God
has redeemed what is his own, to his
glory and praise.
15 Because of all this, now that I have
heard of your faith in the Lord JesusEphesians 1.16–21
3
and the love you bear towards all God's
people,
16 I never cease to give thanks for you
when I mention you in my prayers.
17 I pray that the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the all-glorious Father,
may confer on you the spiritual gifts of
wisdom and vision, with the knowledge
of him that they bring.
18 I pray that your inward eyes may
be enlightened, so that you may know
what is the hope to which he calls you,
how rich and glorious is the share he
offers you among his people in their
inheritance,
19 and how vast are the resources of his
power open to us who have faith. His
mighty strength was seen at work
20 when he raised Christ from the dead,
and enthroned him at his right hand in
the heavenly realms,
21 far above all government and
authority, all power and dominion, and
any title of sovereignty that commands
allegiance, not only in this age but also
in the age to come.Ephesians 1.22–2.7
4
22 He put all things in subjection
beneath his feet, and gave him as head
over all things to the church
23 which is his body, the fullness of him
who is filling the universe in all its parts.
1 YOU ONCE were dead because of
your sins and wickedness;
2 you followed the ways of this present
world order, obeying the commander of
the spiritual powers of the air, the spirit
now at work among God's rebel subjects.
3 We too were once of their number: we
were ruled by our physical desires, and
did what instinct and evil imagination
suggested. In our natural condition we
lay under the condemnation of God like
the rest of mankind.
4 But God is rich in mercy, and because
of his great love for us,
5 he brought us to life with Christ when
we were dead because of our sins; it is
by grace you are saved.
6 And he raised us up in union with
Christ Jesus and enthroned us with him
in the heavenly realms,
7 so that he might display in the ages to
come how immense are the resources of
2Ephesians 2.8–14
5
his grace, and how great his kindness to
us in Christ Jesus.
8 For it is by grace you are saved
through faith; it is not your own doing.
It is God's gift,
9 not a reward for work done. There is
nothing for anyone to boast of;
10 we are God's handiwork, created in
Christ Jesus for the life of good deeds
which God designed for us.
11 Remember then your former
condition, Gentiles as you are by birth,
the uncircumcised as you are called
by those who call themselves the
circumcised because of a physical rite.
12 You were at that time separate from
Christ, excluded from the community of
Israel, strangers to God's covenants and
the promise that goes with them. Yours
was a world without hope and without
God.
13 Once you were far off, but now in
union with Christ Jesus you have been
brought near through the shedding of
Christ's blood.
14 For he is himself our peace. Gentiles
and Jews, he has made the two one, and
in his own body of flesh and blood hasEphesians 2.15–22
6
broken down the barrier of enmity which
separated them;
15 for he annulled the law with its rules
and regulations, so as to create out
of the two a single new humanity in
himself, thereby making peace.
16 This was his purpose, to reconcile the
two in a single body to God through the
cross, by which he killed the enmity.
17 So he came and proclaimed the good
news: peace to you who were far off,
and peace to those who were near;
18 for through him we both alike have
access to the Father in the one Spirit.
19 Thus you are no longer aliens in
a foreign land, but fellow-citizens
with God's people, members of God's
household.
20 You are built on the foundation of the
apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus
himself as the corner-stone.
21 In him the whole building is bonded
together and grows into a holy temple in
the Lord.
22 In him you also are being built with
all the others into a spiritual dwelling for
God.Ephesians 3.1–8
7
1 WITH this in mind I pray for you, I,
3 Paul, who for the sake of you Gentiles
am now the prisoner of Christ Jesus --
2 for surely you have heard how God's
gift of grace to me was designed for your
benefit.
3 It was by a revelation that his secret
purpose was made known to me. I have
already written you a brief account of
this,
4 and by reading it you can see that I
understand the secret purpose of Christ.
5 In former generations that secret was
not disclosed to mankind; but now by
inspiration it has been revealed to his
holy apostles and prophets,
6 that through the gospel the Gentiles
are joint heirs with the Jews, part of
the same body, sharers together in the
promise made in Christ Jesus.
7 Such is the gospel of which I was
made a minister by God's unmerited gift,
so powerfully at work in me.
8 To me, who am less than the least
of all God's people, he has granted the
privilege of proclaiming to the Gentiles
the good news of the unfathomable
riches of Christ,Ephesians 3.9–17
8
9 and of bringing to light how this
hidden purpose was to be put into effect.
It lay concealed for long ages with God
the Creator of the universe,
10 in order that now, through the
church, the wisdom of God in its infinite
variety might be made known to the
rulers and authorities in the heavenly
realms.
11 This accords with his age-long
purpose, which he accomplished in
Christ Jesus our Lord,
12 in whom we have freedom of access
to God, with the confidence born of trust
in him.
13 I beg you, then, not to lose heart
over my sufferings for you; indeed, they
are your glory.
14 With this in mind, then, I kneel in
prayer to the Father,
15 from whom every family in heaven
and on earth takes its name,
16 that out of the treasures of his glory
he may grant you inward strength and
power through his Spirit,
17 that through faith Christ may dwell in
your hearts in love. With deep roots and
firm foundationsEphesians 3.18–4.5
9
18 may you, in company with all God's
people, be strong to grasp what is the
breadth and length and height and depth
19 of Christ's love, and to know it,
though it is beyond knowledge. So may
you be filled with the very fullness of
God.
20 Now to him who is able through the
power which is at work among us to do
immeasurably more than all we can ask
or conceive,
21 to him be glory in the church and
in Christ Jesus from generation to
generation for evermore! Amen.
1 I IMPLORE you then -- I, a prisoner
for the Lord's sake: as God has called
you, live up to your calling.
2 Be humble always and gentle, and
patient too, putting up with one another's
failings in the spirit of love.
3 Spare no effort to make fast with
bonds of peace the unity which the Spirit
gives.
4 There is one body and one Spirit, just
as there is one hope held out in God's
call to you;
5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
4Ephesians 4.6–14
10
6 one God and Father of all, who is over
all and through all and in all.
7 But each of us has been given a
special gift, a particular share in the
bounty of Christ.
8 That is why scripture says: He
ascended into the heights; he took
captives into captivity; he gave gifts to
men.
9 Now, the word ascended implies that
he also descended to the lowest level,
down to the very earth.
10 He who descended is none other than
he who ascended far above all heavens,
so that he might fill the universe.
11 And it is he who has given some
to be apostles, some prophets, some
evangelists, some pastors and teachers,
12 to equip God's people for work in his
service, for the building up of the body
of Christ,
13 until we all attain to the unity inherent
in our faith and in our knowledge of
the Son of God -- to mature manhood,
measured by nothing less than the full
stature of Christ.
14 We are no longer to be children,
tossed about by the waves and whirledEphesians 4.15–21
11
around by every fresh gust of teaching,
dupes of cunning rogues and their
deceitful schemes.
15 Rather we are to maintain the truth
in a spirit of love; so shall we fully grow
up into Christ. He is the head,
16 and on him the whole body depends.
Bonded and held together by every
constituent joint, the whole frame grows
through the proper functioning of each
part, and builds itself up in love.
17 Here then is my word to you, and I
urge it on you in the Lord's name: give
up living as pagans do with their futile
notions.
18 Their minds are closed, they are
alienated from the life that is in God,
because ignorance prevails among them
and their hearts have grown hard as
stone.
19 Dead to all feeling, they have
abandoned themselves to vice, and there
is no indecency that they do not practise.
20 But that is not how you learned
Christ.
21 For were you not told about him,
were you not as Christians taught the
truth as it is in Jesus?Ephesians 4.22–30
12
22 Renouncing your former way of life,
you must lay aside the old human nature
which, deluded by its desires, is in
process of decay:
23 you must be renewed in mind and
spirit,
24 and put on the new nature created in
God's likeness, which shows itself in the
upright and devout life called for by the
truth.
25 Then have done with falsehood and
speak the truth to each other, for we
belong to one another as parts of one
body.
26 If you are angry, do not be led into
sin; do not let sunset find you nursing
your anger;
27 and give no foothold to the devil.
28 The thief must give up stealing,
and work hard with his hands to earn
an honest living, so that he may have
something to share with the needy.
29 Let no offensive talk pass your lips,
only what is good and helpful to the
occasion, so that it brings a blessing to
those who hear it.
30 Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
for that Spirit is the seal with whichEphesians 4.31–5.6
13
you were marked for the day of final
liberation.
31 Have done with all spite and bad
temper, with rage, insults, and slander,
with evil of any kind.
32 Be generous to one another, tender-
hearted, forgiving one another as God in
Christ forgave you.
1 In a word, as God's dear children,
you must be like him.
2 Live in love as Christ loved you and
gave himself up on your behalf, an
offering and sacrifice whose fragrance is
pleasing to God.
3 Fornication and indecency of any kind,
or ruthless greed, must not be so much
as mentioned among you, as befits the
people of God.
4 No coarse, stupid, or flippant talk:
these things are out of place; you should
rather be thanking God.
5 For be very sure of this: no one given
to fornication or vice, or the greed which
makes an idol of gain, has any share in
the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no one deceive you with shallow
arguments; it is for these things that
5Ephesians 5.7–17
14
divine retribution falls on God's rebel
subjects.
7 Have nothing to do with them.
8 Though you once were darkness,
now as Christians you are light. Prove
yourselves at home in the light,
9 for where light is, there is a harvest of
goodness, righteousness, and truth.
10 Learn to judge for yourselves what is
pleasing to the Lord;
11 take no part in the barren deeds of
darkness, but show them up for what
they are.
12 It would be shameful even to mention
what is done in secret.
13 But everything is shown up by being
exposed to the light, and whatever is
exposed to the light itself becomes light.
14 That is why it is said: Awake, sleeper,
rise from the dead, and Christ will shine
upon you.
15 Take great care, then, how you
behave: act sensibly, not like simpletons.
16 Use the present opportunity to the
full, for these are evil days.
17 Do not be foolish, but understand
what the will of the Lord is.Ephesians 5.18–27
15
18 Do not give way to drunkenness and
the ruin that goes with it, but let the
Holy Spirit fill you:
19 speak to one another in psalms,
hymns, and songs; sing and make music
from your heart to the Lord;
20 and in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ give thanks every day for
everything to our God and Father.
21 BE subject to one another out of
reverence for Christ.
22 Wives, be subject to your husbands
as though to the Lord;
23 for the man is the head of the
woman, just as Christ is the head of the
church. Christ is, indeed, the saviour of
that body;
24 but just as the church is subject to
Christ, so must women be subject to
their husbands in everything.
25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ
loved the church and gave himself up for
it,
26 to consecrate and cleanse it by water
and word,
27 so that he might present the church
to himself all glorious, with no stain orEphesians 5.28–6.2
16
wrinkle or anything of the sort, but holy
and without blemish.
28 In the same way men ought to love
their wives, as they love their own
bodies. In loving his wife a man loves
himself.
29 For no one ever hated his own body;
on the contrary, he keeps it nourished
and warm, and that is how Christ treats
the church,
30 because it is his body, of which we
are living parts.
31 This is why (in the words of scripture)
a man shall leave his father and mother
and be united to his wife, and the two
shall become one flesh.
32 There is hidden here a great truth,
which I take to refer to Christ and to the
church.
33 But it applies also to each one of
you: the husband must love his wife as
his very self, and the wife must show
reverence for her husband.
1 Children, obey your parents; for it
is only right that you should.
2 Honour your father and your mother
is the first commandment to carry a
promise with it:
6Ephesians 6.3–12
17
3 that it may be well with you and that
you may live long on the earth.
4 Fathers, do not goad your children to
resentment, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.
5 Slaves, give single-minded obedience
to your earthly masters with fear and
trembling, as if to Christ.
6 Do it not merely to catch their eye or
curry favour with them, but as slaves of
Christ do the will of God wholeheartedly.
7 Give cheerful service, as slaves of the
Lord rather than of men.
8 You know that whatever good anyone
may do, slave or free, will be repaid by
the Lord.
9 Masters, treat your slaves in the
same spirit: give up using threats, and
remember that you both have the same
Master in heaven; there is no favouritism
with him.
10 FINALLY, find your strength in the
Lord, in his mighty power.
11 Put on the full armour provided by
God, so that you may be able to stand
firm against the stratagems of the devil.
12 For our struggle is not against human
foes, but against cosmic powers, againstEphesians 6.13–19
18
the authorities and potentates of this
dark age, against the superhuman forces
of evil in the heavenly realms.
13 Therefore, take up the armour of
God; then you will be able to withstand
them on the evil day and, after doing
your utmost, to stand your ground.
14 Stand fast, I say. Fasten on the belt of
truth; for a breastplate put on integrity;
15 let the shoes on your feet be the
gospel of peace, to give you firm footing;
16 and, with all these, take up the great
shield of faith, with which you will be
able to quench all the burning arrows of
the evil one.
17 Accept salvation as your helmet, and
the sword which the Spirit gives you, the
word of God.
18 Constantly ask God's help in prayer,
and pray always in the power of the
Spirit. To this end keep watch and
persevere, always interceding for all
God's people.
19 Pray also for me, that I may be
granted the right words when I speak,
and may boldly and freely make known
the hidden purpose of the gospel,Ephesians 6.20–24
19
20 for which I am an ambassador --
in chains. Pray that I may speak of it
boldly, as is my duty.
21 YOU WILL want to know how I am
and what I am doing; Tychicus will give
you all the news. He is our dear brother
and trustworthy helper in the Lord's
work.
22 I am sending him to you on purpose
to let you have news of us and to put
fresh heart into you.
23 Peace to the community and love
with faith, from God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.
24 God's grace be with all who love our
Lord Jesus Christ with undying love.Philippians
1 FROM Paul and Timothy, servants
1 of Christ Jesus, to all God's people
at Philippi, who are incorporate in Christ
Jesus, with the bishops and deacons.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 I thank my God every time I think of
you;
4 whenever I pray for you all, my
prayers are always joyful,
5 because of the part you have taken in
the work of the gospel from the first day
until now.
6 Of this I am confident, that he who
started the good work in you will bring it
to completion by the day of Christ Jesus.
7 It is only natural that I should feel
like this about you all, because I have
great affection for you, knowing that,
both while I am kept in prison and when
I am called on to defend the truth of the
gospel, you all share in this privilege of
mine.Philippians 1.8–15
2
8 God knows how I long for you all
with the deep yearning of Christ Jesus
himself.
9 And this is my prayer, that your love
may grow ever richer in knowledge and
insight of every kind,
10 enabling you to learn by experience
what things really matter. Then on the
day of Christ you will be flawless and
without blame,
11 yielding the full harvest of
righteousness that comes through Jesus
Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
12 MY friends, I want you to understand
that the progress of the gospel has
actually been helped by what has
happened to me.
13 It has become common knowledge
throughout the imperial guard, and
indeed among the public at large, that
my imprisonment is in Christ's cause;
14 and my being in prison has given
most of our fellow-Christians confidence
to speak the word of God fearlessly and
with extraordinary courage.
15 Some, it is true, proclaim Christ in a
jealous and quarrelsome spirit, but some
do it in goodwill.Philippians 1.16–23
3
16 These are moved by love, knowing
that it is to defend the gospel that I am
where I am;
17 the others are moved by selfish
ambition and present Christ from mixed
motives, meaning to cause me distress
as I lie in prison.
18 What does it matter? One way or
another, whether sincerely or not, Christ
is proclaimed; and for that I rejoice. Yes,
and I shall go on rejoicing;
19 for I know well that the issue will be
my deliverance, because you are praying
for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is
given me for support.
20 It is my confident hope that nothing
will daunt me or prevent me from
speaking boldly; and that now as always
Christ will display his greatness in me,
whether the verdict be life or death.
21 For to me life is Christ, and death is
gain.
22 If I am to go on living in the body
there is fruitful work for me to do. Which
then am I to choose? I cannot tell.
23 I am pulled two ways: my own desire
is to depart and be with Christ -- that is
better by far;Philippians 1.24–2.1
4
24 but for your sake the greater need is
for me to remain in the body.
25 This convinces me: I am sure I shall
remain, and stand by you all to ensure
your progress and joy in the faith,
26 so that on my account you may have
even more cause for pride in Christ Jesus
-- through seeing me restored to you.
27 WHATEVER happens, let your conduct
be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that
whether or not I come and see you for
myself I may hear that you are standing
firm, united in spirit and in mind, side
by side in the struggle to advance the
gospel faith,
28 meeting your opponents without so
much as a tremor. This is a sure sign
to them that destruction is in store for
them and salvation for you, a sign from
God himself;
29 for you have been granted the
privilege not only of believing in Christ
but also of suffering for him.
30 Your conflict is the same as mine;
once you saw me in it, and now you hear
I am in it still.
1 If then our common life in Christ
yields anything to stir the heart, any
2Philippians 2.2–10
5
consolation of love, any participation in
the Spirit, any warmth of affection or
compassion,
2 fill up my cup of happiness by thinking
and feeling alike, with the same love for
one another and a common attitude of
mind.
3 Leave no room for selfish ambition
and vanity, but humbly reckon others
better than yourselves.
4 Look to each other's interests and not
merely to your own.
5 Take to heart among yourselves what
you find in Christ Jesus:
6 He was in the form of God; yet he laid
no claim to equality with God,
7 but made himself nothing, assuming
the form of a slave. Bearing the human
likeness,
8 sharing the human lot, he humbled
himself, and was obedient, even to the
point of death, death on a cross!
9 Therefore God raised him to the
heights and bestowed on him the name
above all names,
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow -- in heaven, on earth, and
in the depths --Philippians 2.11–18
6
11 and every tongue acclaim, Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.
12 So you too, my friends, must be
obedient, as always; even more, now
that I am absent, than when I was
with you. You must work out your own
salvation in fear and trembling;
13 for it is God who works in you,
inspiring both the will and the deed, for
his own chosen purpose.
14 Do everything without grumbling or
argument.
15 Show yourselves innocent and above
reproach, faultless children of God in a
crooked and depraved generation, in
which you shine like stars in a dark world
16 and proffer the word of life. Then you
will be my pride on the day of Christ,
proof that I did not run my race in vain
or labour in vain.
17 But if my life-blood is to be poured
out to complete the sacrifice and offering
up of your faith, I rejoice and share my
joy with you all.
18 You too must rejoice and share your
joy with me.Philippians 2.19–28
7
19 I HOPE, in the Lord Jesus, to send
Timothy to you soon; it will cheer me up
to have news of you.
20 I have no one else here like him, who
has a genuine concern for your affairs;
21 they are all bent on their own
interests, not on those of Christ Jesus.
22 But Timothy's record is known to
you: you know that he has been at my
side in the service of the gospel like a
son working under his father.
23 So he is the one I mean to send as
soon as I see how things go with me;
24 and I am confident, in the Lord, that
I shall be coming myself before long.
25 I have decided I must also send our
brother Epaphroditus, my fellow-worker
and comrade, whom you commissioned
to attend to my needs.
26 He has been missing you all, and was
upset because you heard he was ill.
27 Indeed he was dangerously ill, but
God was merciful to him; and not only to
him but to me, to spare me one sorrow
on top of another.
28 For this reason I am all the more
eager to send him and give you thePhilippians 2.29–3.5
8
happiness of seeing him again; that will
relieve my anxiety as well.
29 Welcome him then in the fellowship
of the Lord with wholehearted delight.
You should honour people like him;
30 in Christ's cause he came near to
death, risking his life to render me the
service you could not give.
1 And now, my friends, I wish you
joy in the Lord. TO REPEAT what I
have written to you before is no trouble
to me, and it is a safeguard for you.
2 Be on your guard against those dogs,
those who do nothing but harm and who
insist on mutilation -- circumcision I will
not call it;
3 we are the circumcision, we who
worship by the Spirit of God, whose
pride is in Christ Jesus, and who put no
confidence in the physical.
4 It is not that I am myself without
grounds for such confidence. If anyone
makes claims of that kind, I can make a
stronger case for myself:
5 circumcised on my eighth day, Israelite
by race, of the tribe of Benjamin, a
Hebrew born and bred; in my practice of
the law a Pharisee,
3Philippians 3.6–12
9
6 in zeal for religion a persecutor of
the church, by the law's standard of
righteousness without fault.
7 But all such assets I have written off
because of Christ.
8 More than that, I count everything
sheer loss, far outweighed by the gain of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose
sake I did in fact forfeit everything. I
count it so much rubbish, for the sake of
gaining Christ
9 and finding myself in union with
him, with no righteousness of my own
based on the law, nothing but the
righteousness which comes from faith in
Christ, given by God in response to faith.
10 My one desire is to know Christ
and the power of his resurrection,
and to share his sufferings in growing
conformity with his death,
11 in hope of somehow attaining the
resurrection from the dead.
12 It is not that I have already achieved
this. I have not yet reached perfection,
but I press on, hoping to take hold of
that for which Christ once took hold of
me.Philippians 3.13–20
10
13 My friends, I do not claim to have
hold of it yet. What I do say is this:
forgetting what is behind and straining
towards what lies ahead,
14 I press towards the finishing line, to
win the heavenly prize to which God has
called me in Christ Jesus.
15 We who are mature should keep to
this way of thinking. If on any point you
think differently, this also God will make
plain to you.
16 Only let our conduct be consistent
with what we have already attained.
17 Join together, my friends, in following
my example. You have us for a model;
imitate those whose way of life conforms
to it.
18 As I have often told you, and now tell
you with tears, there are many whose
way of life makes them enemies of the
cross of Christ.
19 They are heading for destruction,
they make appetite their god, they take
pride in what should bring shame; their
minds are set on earthly things.
20 We, by contrast, are citizens of
heaven, and from heaven we expect our
deliverer to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.Philippians 3.21–4.7
11
21 He will transfigure our humble bodies,
and give them a form like that of his
own glorious body, by that power which
enables him to make all things subject
to himself.
1 This, my dear friends, whom I love
and long for, my joy and crown, this
is what it means to stand firm in the
Lord.
2 Euodia and Syntyche, I appeal to you
both: agree together in the Lord.
3 Yes, and you too, my loyal comrade,
I ask you to help these women, who
shared my struggles in the cause of
the gospel, with Clement and my other
fellow-workers, who are enrolled in the
book of life.
4 I wish you joy in the Lord always.
Again I say: all joy be yours.
5 Be known to everyone for your
consideration of others. The Lord is near;
6 do not be anxious, but in everything
make your requests known to God in
prayer and petition with thanksgiving.
7 Then the peace of God, which is
beyond all understanding, will guard
your hearts and your thoughts in Christ
Jesus.
4Philippians 4.8–15
12
8 And now, my friends, all that is true,
all that is noble, all that is just and
pure, all that is lovable and attractive,
whatever is excellent and admirable --
fill your thoughts with these things.
9 Put into practice the lessons I taught
you, the tradition I have passed on, all
that you heard me say or saw me do;
and the God of peace will be with you.
10 IT is a great joy to me in the Lord
that after so long your care for me has
now revived. I know you always cared;
it was opportunity you lacked.
11 Not that I am speaking of want,
for I have learned to be self-sufficient
whatever my circumstances.
12 I know what it is to have nothing, and
I know what it is to have plenty. I have
been thoroughly initiated into fullness
and hunger, plenty and poverty.
13 I am able to face anything through
him who gives me strength.
14 All the same, it was kind of you to
share the burden of my troubles.
15 You Philippians are aware that, when
I set out from Macedonia in the early
days of my mission, yours was the onlyPhilippians 4.16–23
13
church to share with me in the giving
and receiving;
16 more than once you contributed to
my needs, even at Thessalonica.
17 Do not think I set my heart on the
gift; all I care for is the interest mounting
up in your account.
18 I have been paid in full; I have all I
need and more, now that I have received
from Epaphroditus what you sent. It is a
fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice,
pleasing to God.
19 And my God will supply all your needs
out of the magnificence of his riches in
Christ Jesus.
20 To our God and Father be glory for
ever and ever! Amen.
21 Give my greetings, in the fellowship
of Christ Jesus, to each one of God's
people. My colleagues send their
greetings to you,
22 and so do all God's people here,
particularly those in the emperor's
service.
23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit.Colossians
1 FROM Paul, by the will of God
1 apostle of Christ Jesus, and our
colleague Timothy,
2 to God's people at Colossae, our
fellow-believers in Christ. Grace to you
and peace from God our Father.
3 In all our prayers to God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank him for
you,
4 because we have heard of your faith
in Christ Jesus and the love you bear
towards all God's people;
5 both spring from that hope stored up
for you in heaven of which you learned
when the message of the true gospel
first
6 came to you. That same gospel is
bearing fruit and making new growth the
whole world over, as it does among you
and has done since the day when you
heard of God's grace and learned what it
truly is.Colossians 1.7–14
2
7 It was Epaphras, our dear fellow-
servant and a trusted worker for Christ
on our behalf, who taught you this,
8 and it is he who has brought us news
of the love the Spirit has awakened in
you.
9 THIS is why, ever since we first heard
about you, we have not ceased to pray
for you. We ask God that you may
receive from him full insight into his will,
all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
10 so that your manner of life may be
worthy of the Lord and entirely pleasing
to him. We pray that you may bear fruit
in active goodness of every kind, and
grow in knowledge of God.
11 In his glorious might may he give you
ample strength to meet with fortitude
and patience whatever comes;
12 and to give joyful thanks to the
Father who has made you fit to share the
heritage of God's people in the realm of
light.
13 He rescued us from the domain
of darkness and brought us into the
kingdom of his dear Son,
14 through whom our release is secured
and our sins are forgiven.Colossians 1.15–21
3
15 He is the image of the invisible God;
his is the primacy over all creation.
16 In him everything in heaven and on
earth was created, not only things visible
but also the invisible orders of thrones,
sovereignties, authorities, and powers:
the whole universe has been created
through him and for him.
17 He exists before all things, and all
things are held together in him.
18 He is the head of the body, the
church. He is its origin, the first to return
from the dead, to become in all things
supreme.
19 For in him God in all his fullness
chose to dwell,
20 and through him to reconcile all
things to himself, making peace through
the shedding of his blood on the cross
-- all things, whether on earth or in
heaven.
21 Formerly you yourselves were
alienated from God, his enemies in heart
and mind, as your evil deeds showed.
But now by Christ's death in his body
of flesh and blood God has reconciled
you to himself, so that he may bring youColossians 1.22–28
4
into his own presence, holy and without
blame or blemish.
22 (1:21)
23 Yet you must persevere in faith, firm
on your foundations and never to be
dislodged from the hope offered in the
gospel you accepted. This is the gospel
which has been proclaimed in the whole
creation under heaven, the gospel of
which I, Paul, became a minister.
24 It is now my joy to suffer for you; for
the sake of Christ's body, the church,
I am completing what still remains for
Christ to suffer in my own person.
25 I became a servant of the church by
virtue of the task assigned to me by God
for your benefit: to put God's word into
full effect,
26 that secret purpose hidden for long
ages and through many generations, but
now disclosed to God's people.
27 To them he chose to make known
what a wealth of glory is offered to the
Gentiles in this secret purpose: Christ in
you, the hope of glory.
28 He it is whom we proclaim. We teach
everyone and instruct everyone in all
the ways of wisdom, so as to presentColossians 1.29–2.7
5
each one of you as a mature member of
Christ's body.
29 To this end I am toiling strenuously
with all the energy and power of Christ
at work in me.
1 I want you to know how strenuous
are my exertions for you and the
Laodiceans, and for all who have never
set eyes on me.
2 My aim is to keep them in good heart
and united in love, so that they may
come to the full wealth of conviction
which understanding brings, and grasp
God's secret, which is Christ himself,
3 in whom lie hidden all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.
4 I tell you this to make sure no
one talks you into error by specious
arguments.
5 I may be absent in body, but in spirit
I am with you, and rejoice to see your
unbroken ranks and the solid front which
your faith in Christ presents.
6 THEREFORE, since you have accepted
Christ Jesus as Lord, live in union with
him.
7 Be rooted in him, be built in him,
grow strong in the faith as you were
2Colossians 2.8–14
6
taught; let your hearts overflow with
thankfulness.
8 Be on your guard; let no one capture
your minds with hollow and delusive
speculations, based on traditions of
human teaching and centred on the
elemental spirits of the universe and not
on Christ.
9 For it is in Christ that the Godhead in
all its fullness dwells embodied,
10 it is in him you have been brought to
fulfilment. Every power and authority in
the universe is subject to him as head.
11 In him also you were circumcised, not
in a physical sense, but by the stripping
away of the old nature, which is Christ's
way of circumcision.
12 For you were buried with him in
baptism, and in that baptism you were
also raised to life with him through your
faith in the active power of God, who
raised him from the dead.
13 And although you were dead because
of your sins and your uncircumcision, he
has brought you to life with Christ. For
he has forgiven us all our sins;
14 he has cancelled the bond which was
outstanding against us with its legalColossians 2.15–20
7
demands; he has set it aside, nailing it
to the cross.
15 There he disarmed the cosmic powers
and authorities and made a public
spectacle of them, leading them as
captives in his triumphal procession.
16 ALLOW no one, therefore, to take
you to task about what you eat or drink,
or over the observance of festival, new
moon, or sabbath.
17 These are no more than a shadow of
what was to come; the reality is Christ's.
18 You are not to be disqualified by
the decision of people who go in for
self-mortification and angel-worship and
access to some visionary world. Such
people, bursting with the futile conceit of
worldly minds,
19 lose their hold upon the head; yet it
is from the head that the whole body,
with all its joints and ligaments, has its
needs supplied, and thus knit together
grows according to God's design.
20 Did you not die with Christ and pass
beyond reach of the elemental spirits
of the universe? Then why behave as
though you were still living the life of the
world? Why let people dictate to you:Colossians 2.21–3.6
8
21 Do not handle this, do not taste that,
do not touch the other --
22 referring to things that must all
perish as they are used? That is to follow
human rules and regulations.
23 Such conduct may have an air
of wisdom, with its forced piety, its
self-mortification, and its severity to
the body; but it is of no use at all in
combating sensuality.
1 Were you not raised to life with
Christ? Then aspire to the realm
above, where Christ is, seated at God's
right hand,
2 and fix your thoughts on that higher
realm, not on this earthly life.
3 You died; and now your life lies hidden
with Christ in God.
4 When Christ, who is our life, is
revealed, then you too will be revealed
with him in glory.
5 SO PUT to death those parts of you
which belong to the earth -- fornication,
indecency, lust, evil desires, and the
ruthless greed which is nothing less than
idolatry;
6 on these divine retribution falls.
3Colossians 3.7–15
9
7 This is the way you yourselves once
lived;
8 but now have done with rage, bad
temper, malice, slander, filthy talk --
banish them all from your lips!
9 Do not lie to one another, now that you
have discarded the old human nature
and the conduct that goes with it,
10 and have put on the new nature
which is constantly being renewed in
the image of its Creator and brought to
know God.
11 There is no question here of Greek
and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised,
barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman;
but Christ is all, and is in all.
12 Put on, then, garments that suit God's
chosen and beloved people: compassion,
kindness, humility, gentleness, patience.
13 Be tolerant with one another and
forgiving, if any of you has cause for
complaint: you must forgive as the Lord
forgave you.
14 Finally, to bind everything together
and complete the whole, there must be
love.
15 Let Christ's peace be arbiter in your
decisions, the peace to which you wereColossians 3.16–22
10
called as members of a single body.
Always be thankful.
16 Let the gospel of Christ dwell among
you in all its richness; teach and instruct
one another with all the wisdom it
gives you. With psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, sing from the heart in
gratitude to God.
17 Let every word and action, everything
you do, be in the name of the Lord Jesus,
and give thanks through him to God the
Father.
18 WIVES, be subject to your husbands;
that is your Christian duty.
19 Husbands, love your wives and do
not be harsh with them.
20 Children, obey your parents in
everything, for that is pleasing to God
and is the Christian way.
21 Fathers, do not exasperate your
children, in case they lose heart.
22 Slaves, give entire obedience to your
earthly masters, not merely to catch
their eye or curry favour with them, but
with single-mindedness, out of reverence
for the Lord.Colossians 3.23–4.7
11
23 Whatever you are doing, put your
whole heart into it, as if you were doing
it for the Lord and not for men,
24 knowing that there is a master who
will give you an inheritance as a reward
for your service. Christ is the master you
must serve.
25 Wrongdoers will pay for the wrong
they do; there will be no favouritism.
1 Masters, be just and fair to your
slaves, knowing that you too have a
master in heaven.
2 Persevere in prayer, with minds alert
and with thankful hearts;
3 and include us in your prayers, asking
God to provide an opening for the gospel,
that we may proclaim the secret of
Christ, for which indeed I am in prison.
4 Pray that I may make the secret plain,
as it is my duty to do.
5 Be wise in your dealings with
outsiders, but use your opportunities to
the full.
6 Let your words always be gracious,
never insipid; learn how best to respond
to each person you meet.
7 YOU WILL hear all my news from
Tychicus, our dear brother and
4Colossians 4.8–13
12
trustworthy helper and fellow-servant in
the Lord's work.
8 I am sending him to you for this
purpose, to let you know how we are
and to put fresh heart into you.
9 With him comes Onesimus, our
trustworthy and dear brother, who is one
of yourselves. They will tell you all that
has happened here.
10 Aristarchus, Christ's captive like
myself, sends his greetings; so does
Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (you have
had instructions about him; if he comes,
make him welcome),
11 and Jesus Justus. Of the Jewish
Christians, these are the only ones
working with me for the kingdom of God,
and they have been a great comfort to
me.
12 Greetings from Epaphras, servant
of Christ, who is one of yourselves. He
prays hard for you all the time, that you
may stand fast, as mature Christians,
fully determined to do the will of God.
13 I can vouch for him, that he works
tirelessly for you and the people at
Laodicea and Hierapolis.Colossians 4.14–18
13
14 Greetings to you from our dear friend
Luke, the doctor, and from Demas.
15 Give our greetings to the Christians
at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the
congregation that meets at her house.
16 Once this letter has been read among
you, see that it is read also to the church
at Laodicea, and that you in turn read
my letter to Laodicea.
17 Give Archippus this message:
See that you carry out fully the duty
entrusted to you in the Lord's service.
18 I add this greeting in my own hand --
Paul. Remember I am in prison. Grace
be with you.1 Thessalonians
1 FROM Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy
1 to the church of the Thessalonians
who belong to God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and
peace.
2 We always thank God for you all, and
mention you in our prayers.
3 We continually call to mind, before
our God and Father, how your faith
has shown itself in action, your love in
labour, and your hope of our Lord Jesus
Christ in perseverance.
4 My dear friends, beloved by God, we
are certain that he has chosen you,
5 because when we brought you the
gospel we did not bring it in mere words
but in the power of the Holy Spirit and
with strong conviction. You know what
we were like for your sake when we were
with you.
6 You, in turn, followed the example set
by us and by the Lord; the welcome you
gave the message meant grave suffering1 Thessalonians 1.7– 2.3
2
for you, yet you rejoiced in the Holy
Spirit;
7 and so you have become a model for
all believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
8 From you the word of the Lord rang
out; and not in Macedonia and Achaia
alone, but everywhere your faith in God
has become common knowledge. No
words of ours are needed;
9 everyone is spreading the story of our
visit to you: how you turned from idols
to be servants of the true and living God,
10 and to wait expectantly for his Son
from heaven, whom he raised from
the dead, Jesus our deliverer from the
retribution to come.
1 YOU KNOW for yourselves, my
friends, that our visit to you was not
fruitless.
2 Far from it! After all the injury and
outrage which as you know we had
suffered at Philippi, by the help of our
God we declared the gospel of God to
you frankly and fearlessly in face of great
opposition.
3 The appeal we make does not spring
from delusion or sordid motive or from
any attempt to deceive;
21 Thessalonians 2.4– 10
3
4 but God has approved us as fit to
be entrusted with the gospel. So when
we preach, we do not curry favour with
men; we seek only the favour of God,
who is continually testing our hearts.
5 We have never resorted to flattery, as
you have cause to know; nor, as God is
our witness, have our words ever been a
cloak for greed.
6 We have never sought honour from
men, not from you or from anyone else,
7 although as Christ's own envoys we
might have made our weight felt; but
we were as gentle with you as a nurse
caring for her children.
8 Our affection was so deep that we
were determined to share with you not
only the gospel of God but our very
selves; that is how dear you had become
to us!
9 You remember, my friends, our toil
and drudgery; night and day we worked
for a living, rather than be a burden to
any of you while we proclaimed to you
the good news of God.
10 We call you to witness, yes and
God himself, how devout and just and1 Thessalonians 2.11 –16
4
blameless was our conduct towards you
who are believers.
11 As you well know, we dealt with each
one of you as a father deals with his
children;
12 we appealed to you, we encouraged
you, we urged you, to live lives worthy of
the God who calls you into his kingdom
and glory.
13 We have reason to thank God
continually because, when we handed on
God's message, you accepted it, not as
the word of men, but as what it truly is,
the very word of God at work in you who
are believers.
14 You, my friends, have followed the
example of the Christians in the churches
of God in Judaea: you have been treated
by your own countrymen as they were
treated by the Jews,
15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the
prophets and drove us out, and are so
heedless of God's will and such enemies
of their fellow-men
16 that they hinder us from telling the
Gentiles how they may be saved. All
this time they have been making up
the full measure of their guilt. But now1 Thessalonians 2.17– 3.4
5
retribution has overtaken them for good
and all!
17 MY friends, when for a short spell you
were lost to us -- out of sight but not out
of mind -- we were exceedingly anxious
to see you again.
18 So we made up our minds to visit you
-- I, Paul, more than once -- but Satan
thwarted us.
19 For what hope or joy or triumphal
crown is there for us when we stand
before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
What indeed but you?
20 You are our glory and our joy.
1 So when we could bear it no longer,
we decided to stay on alone at
Athens,
2 and sent Timothy, our colleague and a
fellow-worker with God in the service of
the gospel of Christ, to encourage you to
stand firm for the faith
3 and under all these hardships remain
unshaken. You know that this is our
appointed lot,
4 for when we were with you we warned
you that we were bound to suffer
hardship; and so it has turned out, as
you have found.
31 Thessalonians 3.5– 12
6
5 This was why I could bear it no longer
and sent to find out about your faith; I
was afraid that the tempter might have
tempted you and our labour might be
wasted.
6 But now Timothy has just returned
from his visit to you, bringing good news
of your faith and love. He tells us that
you always think kindly of us, and are as
anxious to see us as we are to see you.
7 So amid all our difficulties and
hardships we are reassured, my friends,
by the news of your faith.
8 It is the breath of life to us to know
that you stand firm in the Lord.
9 What thanks can we give to God in
return for you? What thanks for all the
joy you have brought us, making us
rejoice before our God
10 while we pray most earnestly night
and day to be allowed to see you again
and to make good whatever is lacking in
your faith?
11 May our God and Father himself, and
our Lord Jesus, open the way for us to
come to you;
12 and may the Lord make your love
increase and overflow to one another1 Thessalonians 3.13– 4.6
7
and to everyone, as our love does to
you.
13 May he make your hearts firm, so
that you may stand before our God and
Father holy and faultless when our Lord
Jesus comes with all those who are his
own.
1 AND now, friends, we have one
thing to ask of you, as fellow-
Christians. We passed on to you the
tradition of the way we must live if
we are to please God; you are indeed
already following it, but we beg you to
do so yet more thoroughly.
2 You know the rules we gave you in the
name of the Lord Jesus.
3 This is the will of God, that you
should be holy: you must abstain from
fornication;
4 each one of you must learn to gain
mastery over his body, to hallow and
honour it,
5 not giving way to lust like the pagans
who know nothing of God;
6 no one must do his fellow-Christian
wrong in this matter, or infringe his
rights. As we impressed on you before,
the Lord punishes all such offences.
41 Thessalonians 4.7– 14
8
7 For God called us to holiness, not to
impurity.
8 Anyone therefore who flouts these
rules is flouting not man but the God
who bestows on you his Holy Spirit.
9 About love of the brotherhood you
need no words of mine, for you are
yourselves taught by God to love one
another,
10 and you are in fact practising this rule
of love towards all your fellow-Christians
throughout Macedonia. Yet we appeal to
you, friends, to do better still.
11 Let it be your ambition to live quietly
and attend to your own business; and to
work with your hands, as we told you,
12 so that you may command the
respect of those outside your own
number, and at the same time never be
in want.
13 WE wish you not to remain in
ignorance, friends, about those who
sleep in death; you should not grieve like
the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
14 We believe that Jesus died and rose
again; so too will God bring those who
died as Christians to be with Jesus.1 Thessalonians 4.15– 5.4
9
15 This we tell you as a word from the
Lord: those of us who are still alive when
the Lord comes will have no advantage
over those who have died;
16 when the command is given, when
the archangel's voice is heard, when
God's trumpet sounds, then the Lord
himself will descend from heaven; first
the Christian dead will rise,
17 then we who are still alive shall join
them, caught up in clouds to meet the
Lord in the air. Thus we shall always be
with the Lord.
18 Console one another, then, with these
words.
1 About dates and times, my friends,
there is no need to write to you,
2 for you yourselves know perfectly well
that the day of the Lord comes like a
thief in the night.
3 While they are saying, All is peaceful,
all secure, destruction is upon them,
sudden as the pangs that come on a
woman in childbirth; and there will be no
escape.
4 But you, friends, are not in the dark;
the day will not come upon you like a
thief.
51 Thessalonians 5.5– 13
10
5 You are all children of light, children
of day. We do not belong to night and
darkness,
6 and we must not sleep like the rest,
but keep awake and sober.
7 Sleepers sleep at night, and drunkards
get drunk at night,
8 but we, who belong to the daylight,
must keep sober, armed with the
breastplate of faith and love, and the
hope of salvation for a helmet.
9 God has not destined us for retribution,
but for the full attainment of salvation
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
10 He died for us so that awake or
asleep we might live in company with
him.
11 Therefore encourage one another,
build one another up -- as indeed you
do.
12 WE beg you, friends, to acknowledge
those who are working so hard among
you, and are your leaders and counsellors
in the Lord's fellowship.
13 Hold them in the highest esteem and
affection for the work they do. Live at
peace among yourselves.1 Thessalonians 5.14 –26
11
14 We urge you, friends, to rebuke
the idle, encourage the faint-hearted,
support the weak, and be patient with
everyone.
15 See to it that no one pays back wrong
for wrong, but always aim at what is
best for each other and for all.
16 Always be joyful;
17 pray continually;
18 give thanks whatever happens; for
this is what God wills for you in Christ
Jesus.
19 Do not stifle inspiration
20 or despise prophetic utterances,
21 but test them all; keep hold of what
is good
22 and avoid all forms of evil.
23 May God himself, the God of peace,
make you holy through and through, and
keep you sound in spirit, soul, and body,
free of any fault when our Lord Jesus
Christ comes.
24 He who calls you keeps faith; he will
do it.
25 Friends, pray for us also.
26 Greet all our fellow-Christians with
the kiss of peace.1 Thessalonians 5.27 –28
12
27 I adjure you by the Lord to have this
letter read to them all.
28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you!2 Thessalonians
1 FROM Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy
1 to the church of the Thessalonians
who belong to God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Grace to you and peace from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Friends, we are always bound to
thank God for you, and it is right that
we should, because your faith keeps on
increasing and the love you all have for
each other grows ever greater.
4 Indeed we boast about you among
the churches of God, because your
faith remains so steadfast under all the
persecutions and troubles you endure.
5 This points to the justice of God's
judgement; you will be proved worthy
of the kingdom of God, for which indeed
you are suffering.
6 It is just that God should balance the
account by sending affliction to those
who afflict you,
7 and relief to you who are afflicted,
and to us as well, when the Lord Jesus2 Thessalonians 1.8– 2.1
2
is revealed from heaven with his mighty
angels
8 in blazing fire. Then he will mete
out punishment to those who refuse to
acknowledge God and who will not obey
the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
9 They will suffer the penalty of eternal
destruction, cut off from the presence of
the Lord and the splendour of his might,
10 when on the great day he comes
to reveal his glory among his own and
his majesty among all believers; and
therefore among you, since you believed
the testimony we brought you.
11 With this in mind we pray for you
always, that our God may count you
worthy of your calling, and that his
power may bring to fulfilment every
good purpose and every act inspired by
faith,
12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus
may be glorified in you, and you in him,
according to the grace of our God and
the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 NOW ABOUT the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, when he is to gather us
to himself: I beg you, my friends,
22 Thessalonians 2.2 –8
3
2 do not suddenly lose your heads,
do not be alarmed by any prophetic
utterance, any pronouncement, or any
letter purporting to come from us,
alleging that the day of the Lord is
already here.
3 Let no one deceive you in any way.
That day cannot come before the final
rebellion against God, when wickedness
will be revealed in human form, the man
doomed to destruction.
4 He is the adversary who raises himself
up against every so-called god or object
of worship, and even enthrones himself
in God's temple claiming to be God.
5 Do you not remember that I told you
this while I was still with you?
6 You know, too, about the restraining
power which ensures that he will be
revealed only at his appointed time;
7 for already the secret forces of
wickedness are at work, secret only for
the present until the restraining hand is
removed from the scene.
8 Then he will be revealed, the wicked
one whom the Lord Jesus will destroy
with the breath of his mouth and2 Thessalonians 2.9– 14
4
annihilate by the radiance of his
presence.
9 The coming of the wicked one is the
work of Satan; it will be attended by
all the powerful signs and miracles that
falsehood can devise,
10 all the deception that sinfulness can
impose on those doomed to destruction,
because they did not open their minds to
love of the truth and so find salvation.
11 That is why God puts them under a
compelling delusion, which makes them
believe what is false,
12 so that all who have not believed the
truth but made sinfulness their choice
may be brought to judgement.
13 WE are always bound to thank God
for you, my friends beloved by the Lord.
From the beginning of time God chose
you to find salvation in the Spirit who
consecrates you and in the truth you
believe.
14 It was for this that he called you
through the gospel we brought, so
that you might come to possess the
splendour of our Lord Jesus Christ.2 Thessalonians 2.15– 3.6
5
15 Stand firm then, my friends, and hold
fast to the traditions which you have
learned from us by word or by letter.
16 And may our Lord Jesus Christ
himself and God our Father, who has
shown us such love, and in his grace has
given us such unfailing encouragement
and so sure a hope,
17 still encourage and strengthen you in
every good deed and word.
1 AND now, friends, pray for us,
that the word of the Lord may
have everywhere the swift and glorious
success it has had among you,
2 and that we may be rescued from
wrong-headed and wicked people; for
not all have faith.
3 But the Lord keeps faith, and he will
strengthen you and guard you from the
evil one;
4 and in the Lord we have confidence
about you, that you are doing and will
continue to do what we tell you.
5 May the Lord direct your hearts
towards God's love and the steadfastness
of Christ.
6 These are our instructions to you,
friends, in the name of our Lord Jesus
32 Thessalonians 3.7– 14
6
Christ: hold aloof from every Christian
who falls into idle habits, and disregards
the tradition you received from us.
7 You yourselves know how you ought
to follow our example: you never saw us
idling;
8 we did not accept free hospitality
from anyone; night and day in toil and
drudgery we worked for a living, rather
than be a burden to any of you --
9 not because we do not have the right
to maintenance, but to set an example
for you to follow.
10 Already during our stay with you we
laid down this rule: anyone who will not
work shall not eat.
11 We mention this because we hear
that some of you are idling their time
away, minding everybody's business but
their own.
12 We instruct and urge such people in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to
settle down to work and earn a living.
13 My friends, you must never tire of
doing right.
14 If anyone disobeys the instructions
given in my letter, single him out, and2 Thessalonians 3.15 –18
7
have nothing to do with him until he is
ashamed of himself.
15 I do not mean treat him as an enemy,
but admonish him as one of the family.
16 May the Lord of peace himself give
you peace at all times and in all ways.
The Lord be with you all.
17 This greeting is in my own
handwriting; all genuine letters of mine
bear the same signature -- Paul.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all.1 Timothy
1 FROM Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus
1 by command of God our Saviour and
Christ Jesus our hope,
2 to Timothy his true-born son in the
faith. Grace, mercy, and peace to you
from God the Father and Christ Jesus
our Lord.
3 WHEN I was starting for Macedonia,
I urged you to stay on at Ephesus. You
were to instruct certain people to give
up teaching erroneous doctrines
4 and devoting themselves to
interminable myths and genealogies,
which give rise to mere speculation, and
do not further God's plan for us, which
works through faith.
5 This instruction has love as its goal,
the love which springs from a pure heart,
a good conscience, and a genuine faith.
6 Through lack of these some people
have gone astray into a wilderness of
words.
7 They set out to be teachers of the law,
although they do not understand either1 Timothy 1.8–14
2
the words they use or the subjects about
which they are so dogmatic.
8 We all know that the law is an
admirable thing, provided we treat it as
law,
9 recognizing that it is designed not
for good citizens, but for the lawless
and unruly, the impious and sinful, the
irreligious and worldly, for parricides and
matricides, murderers
10 and fornicators, perverts, kidnappers,
liars, perjurers -- in fact all whose
behaviour flouts the sound teaching
11 which conforms with the gospel
entrusted to me, the gospel which tells
of the glory of the ever-blessed God.
12 I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord,
who has made me equal to the task; I
thank him for judging me worthy of trust
and appointing me to his service --
13 although in the past I had met him
with abuse and persecution and outrage.
But because I acted in the ignorance of
unbelief I was dealt with mercifully;
14 the grace of our Lord was lavished
upon me, along with the faith and love
which are ours in Christ Jesus.1 Timothy 1.15– 20
3
15 Here is a saying you may trust, one
that merits full acceptance: Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners; and
among them I stand first.
16 But I was mercifully dealt with for
this very purpose, that Jesus Christ
might find in me the first occasion for
displaying his inexhaustible patience,
and that I might be typical of all who
were in future to have faith in him and
gain eternal life.
17 To the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, the only God, be honour and
glory for ever and ever! Amen.
18 In laying this charge upon you,
Timothy my son, I am guided by those
prophetic utterances which first directed
me to you. Encouraged by them, fight
the good fight
19 with faith and a clear conscience. It
was through spurning conscience that
certain persons made shipwreck of their
faith,
20 among them Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I consigned to Satan,
in the hope that through this discipline
they might learn not to be blasphemous.1 Timothy 2.1–9
4
1 FIRST of all, then, I urge that
2 petitions, prayers, intercessions, and
thanksgivings be offered for everyone,
2 for sovereigns and for all in high office
so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet
life, free to practise our religion with
dignity.
3 Such prayer is right, and approved by
God our Saviour,
4 whose will it is that all should find
salvation and come to know the truth.
5 For there is one God, and there is one
mediator between God and man, Christ
Jesus, himself man,
6 who sacrificed himself to win freedom
for all mankind, revealing God's purpose
at God's good time;
7 of this I was appointed herald and
apostle (this is no lie, it is the truth), to
instruct the Gentiles in the true faith.
8 It is my desire, therefore, that
everywhere prayers be said by the
men of the congregation, who shall lift
up their hands with a pure intention,
without anger or argument.
9 Women must dress in becoming
manner, modestly and soberly, not with1 Timothy 2.10–3.3
5
elaborate hair-styles, not adorned with
gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
10 but with good deeds, as befits women
who claim to be religious.
11 Their role is to learn, listening quietly
and with due submission.
12 I do not permit women to teach or
dictate to the men; they should keep
quiet.
13 For Adam was created first, and Eve
afterwards;
14 moreover it was not Adam who
was deceived; it was the woman who,
yielding to deception, fell into sin.
15 But salvation for the woman will be
in the bearing of children, provided she
continues in faith, love, and holiness,
with modesty.
1 Here is a saying you may trust: To
aspire to leadership is an honourable
ambition.
2 A bishop, therefore, must be above
reproach, husband of one wife, sober,
temperate, courteous, hospitable, and a
good teacher;
3 he must not be given to drink
or brawling, but be of a forbearing
31 Timothy 3.4–10
6
disposition, avoiding quarrels, and not
avaricious.
4 He must be one who manages his own
household well and controls his children
without losing his dignity,
5 for if a man does not know how to
manage his own family, how can he
take charge of a congregation of God's
people?
6 He should not be a recent convert;
conceit might bring on him the devil's
punishment.
7 He must moreover have a good
reputation with the outside world, so
that he may not be exposed to scandal
and be caught in the devil's snare.
8 Deacons, likewise, must be dignified,
not indulging in double talk, given
neither to excessive drinking nor to
money-grubbing.
9 They must be men who combine a
clear conscience with a firm hold on the
mystery of the faith.
10 And they too must first undergo
scrutiny, and only if they are of
unimpeachable character may they serve
as deacons.1 Timothy 3.11–4.1
7
11 Women in this office must likewise
be dignified, not scandalmongers, but
sober, and trustworthy in every way.
12 A deacon must be the husband of one
wife, and good at managing his children
and his own household.
13 For deacons with a good record of
service are entitled to high standing and
the right to be heard on matters of the
Christian faith.
14 I am hoping to come to you before
long, but I write this
15 in case I am delayed, to let you
know what is proper conduct in God's
household, that is, the church of the
living God, the pillar and bulwark of the
truth.
16 And great beyond all question
is the mystery of our religion: He
was manifested in flesh, vindicated
in spirit, seen by angels; he was
proclaimed among the nations, believed
in throughout the world, raised to
heavenly glory.
1 THE Spirit explicitly warns us that
in time to come some will forsake
the faith and surrender their minds to
41 Timothy 4.2–8
8
subversive spirits and demon-inspired
doctrines,
2 through the plausible falsehoods of
those whose consciences have been
permanently branded.
3 They will forbid marriage, and insist on
abstinence from foods which God created
to be enjoyed with thanksgiving by
believers who have come to knowledge
of the truth.
4 Everything that God has created is
good, and nothing is to be rejected
provided it is accepted with thanksgiving,
5 for it is then made holy by God's word
and by prayer.
6 By offering such advice as this to the
brotherhood you will prove to be a good
servant of Christ Jesus, nurtured in the
precepts of our faith and of the sound
instruction which you have followed.
7 Have nothing to do with superstitious
myths, mere old wives' tales. Keep
yourself in training for the practice of
religion;
8 for while the training of the body
brings limited benefit, the benefits of
religion are without limit, since it holds1 Timothy 4.9–16
9
out promise not only for this life but also
for the life to come.
9 Here is a saying you may trust, one
that merits full acceptance.
10 This is why we labour and struggle,
because we have set our hope on the
living God, who is the Saviour of all --
the Saviour, above all, of believers.
11 Insist on these things in your
teaching.
12 Let no one underrate you because
you are young, but be to believers an
example in speech and behaviour, in
love, fidelity, and purity.
13 Until I arrive devote yourself to
the public reading of the scriptures, to
exhortation, and to teaching.
14 Do not neglect the spiritual
endowment given you when, under the
guidance of prophecy, the elders laid
their hands on you.
15 Make these matters your business,
make them your absorbing interest, so
that your progress may be plain to all.
16 Persevere in them, keeping close
watch on yourself and on your teaching;
by doing so you will save both yourself
and your hearers.1 Timothy 5.1–8
10
1 NEVER be harsh with an older
5 man; appeal to him as if he were
your father. Treat the younger men as
brothers,
2 the older women as mothers, and the
younger as your sisters, in all purity.
3 Enrol as widows only those who are
widows in the fullest sense.
4 If a widow has children or
grandchildren, they should learn
as their first duty to show loyalty to the
family and so repay what they owe to
their parents and grandparents; for that
has God's approval.
5 But a widow in the full sense, one
who is alone in the world, puts all her
trust in God, and regularly, night and
day, attends the meetings for prayer and
worship.
6 A widow given to self-indulgence,
however, is as good as dead.
7 Add these instructions to the rest, so
that the widows may be above reproach.
8 And if anyone does not make provision
for his relations, and especially for
members of his own household, he has
denied the faith and is worse than an
unbeliever.1 Timothy 5.9–14
11
9 A widow under sixty years of age
should not be put on the roll. An enrolled
widow must have been the wife of one
husband,
10 and must have gained a reputation
for good deeds, by taking care of
children, by showing hospitality, by
washing the feet of God's people, by
supporting those in distress -- in short,
by doing good at every opportunity.
11 Do not admit younger widows to the
roll; for if they let their passions distract
them from Christ's service they will want
to marry again,
12 and so be guilty of breaking their
earlier vow to him.
13 Besides, in going round from house
to house they would learn to be idle,
indeed worse than idle, gossips and
busybodies, speaking of things better
left unspoken.
14 For that reason it is my wish that
young widows should marry again, have
children, and manage a household; then
they will give the enemy no occasion for
scandal.1 Timothy 5.15– 22
12
15 For there have in fact been some who
have taken the wrong turning and gone
over to Satan.
16 If a Christian woman has widows in
her family, she must support them; the
congregation must be relieved of the
burden, so that it may be free to support
those who are widows in the full sense.
17 Elders who give good service as
leaders should be reckoned worthy of a
double stipend, in particular those who
work hard at preaching and teaching.
18 For scripture says, You shall not
muzzle an ox while it is treading out the
grain; besides, The worker earns his pay.
19 Do not entertain a charge against an
elder unless it is supported by two or
three witnesses.
20 Those who do commit sins you must
rebuke in public, to put fear into the
others.
21 Before God and Christ Jesus and the
angels who are his chosen, I solemnly
charge you: maintain these rules, never
prejudging the issue, but acting with
strict impartiality.
22 Do not be over-hasty in the laying
on of hands, or you may find yourself1 Timothy 5.23–6.3
13
implicated in other people's misdeeds;
keep yourself above reproach.
23 Stop drinking only water; in view of
your frequent ailments take a little wine
to help your digestion.
24 There are people whose offences are
so obvious that they precede them into
court, and others whose offences have
not yet caught up with them.
25 So too with good deeds; they may be
obvious, but, even if they are not, they
cannot be concealed for ever.
1 All who wear the yoke of slavery
must consider their masters worthy
of all respect, so that the name of
God and the Christian teaching are not
brought into disrepute.
2 Slaves of Christian masters must not
take liberties with them just because
they are their brothers. Quite the
contrary: they must do their work all
the better because those who receive
the benefit of their service are one with
them in faith and love. THIS is what you
are to teach and preach.
3 Anyone who teaches otherwise,
and does not devote himself to sound
precepts -- that is, those of our Lord
61 Timothy 6.4–10
14
Jesus Christ -- and to good religious
teaching,
4 is a pompous ignoramus with a morbid
enthusiasm for mere speculations and
quibbles. These give rise to jealousy,
quarrelling, slander, base suspicions,
5 and endless wrangles -- all typical
of those whose minds are corrupted
and who have lost their grip of the
truth. They think religion should yield
dividends;
6 and of course religion does yield high
dividends, but only to those who are
content with what they have.
7 We brought nothing into this world,
and we can take nothing out;
8 if we have food and clothing let us rest
content.
9 Those who want to be rich fall into
temptations and snares and into many
foolish and harmful desires which plunge
people into ruin and destruction.
10 The love of money is the root of
all evil, and in pursuit of it some have
wandered from the faith and spiked
themselves on many a painful thorn.1 Timothy 6.11– 17
15
11 But you, man of God, must shun all
that, and pursue justice, piety, integrity,
love, fortitude, and gentleness.
12 Run the great race of faith and take
hold of eternal life, for to this you were
called, when you confessed your faith
nobly before many witnesses.
13 Now in the presence of God, who
gives life to all things, and of Jesus
Christ, who himself made that noble
confession in his testimony before
Pontius Pilate, I charge you
14 to obey your orders without fault or
failure until the appearance of our Lord
Jesus Christ
15 which God will bring about in his own
good time. He is the blessed and only
Sovereign, King of kings and Lord of
lords;
16 he alone possesses immortality,
dwelling in unapproachable light; him no
one has ever seen or can ever see; to
him be honour and dominion for ever!
Amen.
17 Instruct those who are rich in this
world's goods not to be proud, and to
fix their hopes not on so uncertain a1 Timothy 6.18– 21
16
thing as money, but on God, who richly
provides all things for us to enjoy.
18 They are to do good and to be
rich in well-doing, to be ready to give
generously and to share with others,
19 and so acquire a treasure which will
form a good foundation for the future.
Then they will grasp the life that is life
indeed.
20 Timothy, keep safe what has been
entrusted to you. Turn a deaf ear to
empty and irreligious chatter, and the
contradictions of knowledge so-called,
21 for by laying claim to it some have
strayed far from the faith. Grace be with
you all!2 Timothy
1 FROM Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus
1 by the will of God, whose promise of
life is fulfilled in Christ Jesus,
2 to Timothy his dear son. Grace, mercy,
and peace to you from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3 I give thanks to the God of my
forefathers, whom I worship with a clear
conscience, when I mention you in my
prayers as I do constantly night and day;
4 when I remember the tears you shed,
I long to see you again and so make my
happiness complete.
5 I am reminded of the sincerity of your
faith, a faith which was alive in Lois your
grandmother and Eunice your mother
before you, and which, I am confident,
now lives in you.
6 THAT is why I remind you to stir into
flame the gift from God which is yours
through the laying on of my hands.
7 For the spirit that God gave us is no
cowardly spirit, but one to inspire power,
love, and self-discipline.2 Timothy 1.8–13
2
8 So never be ashamed of your
testimony to our Lord, nor of me
imprisoned for his sake, but through the
power that comes from God accept your
share of suffering for the sake of the
gospel.
9 It is he who has brought us salvation
and called us to a dedicated life, not
for any merit of ours but for his own
purpose and of his own grace, granted
to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,
10 and now at length disclosed by the
appearance on earth of our Saviour
Jesus Christ. He has broken the power of
death and brought life and immortality
to light through the gospel.
11 Of this gospel I have been appointed
herald, apostle, and teacher.
12 That is the reason for my present
plight; but I am not ashamed of it,
because I know whom I have trusted,
and am confident of his power to keep
safe what he has put into my charge
until the great day.
13 Hold to the outline of sound teaching
which you heard from me, living by the
faith and love which are ours in Christ
Jesus.2 Timothy 1.14–2.4
3
14 Keep safe the treasure put into our
charge, with the help of the Holy Spirit
dwelling within us.
15 As you are aware, everyone in the
province of Asia deserted me, including
Phygelus and Hermogenes.
16 But may the Lord's mercy rest on
the house of Onesiphorus! He has often
relieved me in my troubles; he was not
ashamed to visit a prisoner,
17 but when he came to Rome took
pains to search me out until he found
me.
18 The Lord grant that he find mercy
from the Lord on the great day! You
know as well as anyone the many
services he rendered at Ephesus.
1 TAKE strength, my son, from the
grace of God which is ours in Christ
Jesus.
2 You heard my teaching in the presence
of many witnesses; hand on that
teaching to reliable men who in turn will
be qualified to teach others.
3 Take your share of hardship, like a
good soldier of Christ Jesus.
4 A soldier on active service must not
let himself be involved in the affairs of
22 Timothy 2.5–14
4
everyday life if he is to give satisfaction
to his commanding officer.
5 Again, no athlete wins a prize unless
he abides by the rules.
6 The farmer who does the work has
first claim on the crop.
7 Reflect on what I am saying, and the
Lord will help you to full understanding.
8 Remember the theme of my gospel:
Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, born
of David's line.
9 For preaching this I am exposed to
hardship, even to the point of being
fettered like a criminal; but the word of
God is not fettered.
10 All this I endure for the sake of God's
chosen ones, in the hope that they too
may attain the glorious and eternal
salvation which is in Christ Jesus.
11 Here is a saying you may trust: If we
died with him, we shall live with him;
12 if we endure, we shall reign with him;
if we disown him, he will disown us;
13 if we are faithless, he remains
faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
14 Keep on reminding people of this,
and charge them solemnly before God to2 Timothy 2.15– 21
5
stop disputing about mere words; it does
no good, and only ruins those who listen.
15 Try hard to show yourself worthy
of God's approval, as a worker with no
cause for shame; keep strictly to the
true gospel,
16 avoiding empty and irreligious
chatter; those who indulge in it will stray
farther and farther into godless ways,
17 and the infection of their teaching
will spread like gangrene. Such are
Hymenaeus and Philetus;
18 in saying that our resurrection has
already taken place they are wide of the
truth and undermine people's faith.
19 But God has laid a foundation-
stone, and it stands firm, bearing this
inscription: The Lord knows his own and
Everyone who takes the Lord's name
upon his lips must forsake wickedness.
20 Now in any great house there are
not only utensils of gold and silver, but
also others of wood or earthenware; the
former are valued, the latter held cheap.
21 Anyone who cleanses himself from all
this wickedness will be a vessel valued
and dedicated, a thing useful to the2 Timothy 2.22–3.2
6
master of the house, and fit for any
honourable purpose.
22 Turn from the wayward passions of
youth, and pursue justice, integrity, love,
and peace together with all who worship
the Lord in singleness of mind;
23 have nothing to do with foolish and
wild speculations. You know they breed
quarrels,
24 and a servant of the Lord must not
be quarrelsome; he must be kindly
towards all. He should be a good teacher,
tolerant,
25 and gentle when he must discipline
those who oppose him. God may then
grant them a change of heart and lead
them to recognize the truth;
26 thus they may come to their senses
and escape from the devil's snare in
which they have been trapped and held
at his will.
1 Remember, the final age of this
world is to be a time of turmoil!
2 People will love nothing but self and
money; they will be boastful, arrogant,
and abusive; disobedient to parents,
devoid of gratitude, piety,
32 Timothy 3.3–10
7
3 and natural affection; they will
be implacable in their hatreds,
scandalmongers, uncontrolled and
violent, hostile to all goodness,
4 perfidious, foolhardy, swollen with
self-importance. They will love their
pleasures more than their God.
5 While preserving the outward form of
religion, they are a standing denial of its
power. Keep clear of them.
6 They are the sort that insinuate
themselves into private houses and
there get silly women into their clutches,
women burdened with sins and carried
away by all kinds of desires,
7 always wanting to be taught but
incapable of attaining to a knowledge of
the truth.
8 As Jannes and Jambres opposed
Moses, so these men oppose the truth;
their warped minds disqualify them from
grasping the faith.
9 Their successes will be short-lived;
like those opponents of Moses, they will
come to be recognized by everyone for
the fools they are.
10 But you, my son, have observed
closely my teaching and manner of life,2 Timothy 3.11– 16
8
my resolution, my faithfulness, patience,
and spirit of love, and my fortitude
11 under persecution and suffering -- all
I went through at Antioch, at Iconium, at
Lystra, and the persecutions I endured;
and from all of them the Lord rescued
me.
12 Persecution will indeed come to
everyone who wants to live a godly life
as a follower of Christ Jesus,
13 whereas evildoers and charlatans will
progress from bad to worse, deceiving
and deceived.
14 But for your part, stand by the truths
you have learned and are assured of.
Remember from whom you learned
them;
15 remember that from early childhood
you have been familiar with the sacred
writings which have power to make you
wise and lead you to salvation through
faith in Christ Jesus.
16 All inspired scripture has its use for
teaching the truth and refuting error, or
for reformation of manners and discipline
in right living,2 Timothy 3.17–4.8
9
17 so that the man of God may be
capable and equipped for good work of
every kind.
1 Before God, and before Christ Jesus
who is to judge the living and the
dead, I charge you solemnly by his
coming appearance and his reign,
2 proclaim the message, press it home
in season and out of season, use
argument, reproof, and appeal, with all
the patience that teaching requires.
3 For the time will come when people
will not stand sound teaching, but each
will follow his own whim and gather a
crowd of teachers to tickle his fancy.
4 They will stop their ears to the truth
and turn to fables.
5 But you must keep your head
whatever happens; put up with hardship,
work to spread the gospel, discharge all
the duties of your calling.
6 As for me, my life is already being
poured out on the altar, and the hour for
my departure is upon me.
7 I have run the great race, I have
finished the course, I have kept the faith.
8 And now there awaits me the garland
of righteousness which the Lord, the
42 Timothy 4.9–16
10
righteous Judge, will award to me on the
great day, and not to me alone, but to all
who have set their hearts on his coming
appearance.
9 DO YOUR best to join me soon.
10 Demas, his heart set on this present
world, has deserted me and gone to
Thessalonica; Crescens is away in
Galatia, Titus in Dalmatia; apart from
Luke
11 I have no one with me. Get hold of
Mark and bring him with you; he is a
great help to me.
12 Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
13 When you come, bring the cloak I left
with Carpus at Troas, and the books,
particularly my notebooks.
14 Alexander the coppersmith did me a
great deal of harm. The Lord will deal
with him as he deserves,
15 but you had better be on your guard
against him, for he is bitterly opposed to
everything we teach.
16 At the first hearing of my case no one
came into court to support me; they all
left me in the lurch; I pray that it may
not be counted against them.2 Timothy 4.17– 22
11
17 But the Lord stood by me and
lent me strength, so that I might
be his instrument in making the full
proclamation of the gospel for the whole
pagan world to hear; and thus I was
rescued from the lion's jaws.
18 The Lord will rescue me from every
attempt to do me harm, and bring me
safely into his heavenly kingdom. Glory
to him for ever and ever! Amen.
19 Greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and
the household of Onesiphorus.
20 Erastus stayed behind at Corinth, and
Trophimus I left ill at Miletus.
21 Do try to get here before winter.
Greetings from Eubulus, Pudens,
Linus, and Claudia, and from all the
brotherhood here.
22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace
be with you all!Titus
1 FROM Paul, servant of God and
1 apostle of Jesus Christ, marked
as such by the faith of God's chosen
people and the knowledge of the truth
enshrined in our religion
2 with its hope of eternal life, which
God, who does not lie, promised long
ages ago,
3 and now in his own good time has
openly declared in the proclamation
entrusted to me by command of God our
Saviour.
4 To Titus, my true-born son in the faith
which we share. Grace and peace to you
from God the Father and Jesus Christ
our Saviour.
5 MY intention in leaving you behind in
Crete was that you should deal with any
outstanding matters, and in particular
should appoint elders in each town in
accordance with the principles I have
laid down:
6 Are they men of unimpeachable
character? Is each the husband of oneTitus 1.7–12
2
wife? Are their children believers, not
open to any charge of dissipation or
indiscipline?
7 For as God's steward a bishop must
be a man of unimpeachable character.
He must not be overbearing or short-
tempered or given to drink; no brawler,
no money-grubber,
8 but hospitable, right-minded,
temperate, just, devout, and self-
controlled.
9 He must keep firm hold of the true
doctrine, so that he may be well able
both to appeal to his hearers with sound
teaching and to refute those who raise
objections.
10 There are many, especially among
Jewish converts, who are undisciplined,
who talk wildly and lead others astray.
11 Such men must be muzzled, because
they are ruining whole families by
teaching what they should not, and all
for sordid gain.
12 It was a Cretan prophet, one of their
own countrymen, who said, Cretans
were ever liars, vicious brutes, lazy
gluttons --Titus 1.13–2.5
3
13 and how truly he spoke! All the more
reason why you should rebuke them
sharply, so that they may be restored to
a sound faith,
14 instead of paying heed to Jewish
myths and to human commandments,
the work of those who turn their backs
on the truth.
15 To the pure all things are pure; but
nothing is pure to tainted disbelievers,
tainted both in reason and in conscience.
16 They profess to know God but by their
actions deny him; they are detestable
and disobedient, disqualified for any
good work.
1 For your part, what you say must
be in keeping with sound doctrine.
2 The older men should be sober,
dignified, and temperate, sound in faith,
love, and fortitude.
3 The older women, similarly, should
be reverent in their demeanour, not
scandalmongers or slaves to excessive
drinking; they must set a high standard,
4 and so teach the younger women to
be loving wives and mothers,
5 to be temperate, chaste, busy at
home, and kind, respecting the authority
2Titus 2.6–12
4
of their husbands. Then the gospel will
not be brought into disrepute.
6 Urge the younger men, similarly, to be
temperate
7 in all things, and set them an example
of good conduct yourself. In your
teaching you must show integrity and
seriousness,
8 and offer sound instruction to which
none can take exception. Any opponent
will be at a loss when he finds nothing to
say to our discredit.
9 Slaves are to respect their masters'
authority in everything and to give them
satisfaction; they are not to answer
back,
10 nor to pilfer, but are to show
themselves absolutely trustworthy. In all
this they will add lustre to the doctrine
of God our Saviour.
11 For the grace of God has dawned
upon the world with healing for all
mankind;
12 and by it we are disciplined to
renounce godless ways and worldly
desires, and to live a life of temperance,
honesty, and godliness in the present
age,Titus 2.13–3.4
5
13 looking forward to the happy
fulfilment of our hope when the
splendour of our great God and Saviour
Christ Jesus will appear.
14 He it is who sacrificed himself for us,
to set us free from all wickedness and to
make us his own people, pure and eager
to do good.
15 These are your themes; urge them
and argue them with an authority which
no one can disregard.
1 Remind everyone to be submissive
to the government and the
authorities, and to obey them; to be
ready for any honourable work;
2 to slander no one, to avoid quarrels,
and always to show forbearance and a
gentle disposition to all.
3 There was a time when we too were
lost in folly and disobedience and were
slaves to passions and pleasures of every
kind. Our days were passed in malice
and envy; hateful ourselves, we loathed
one another.
4 But when the kindness and generosity
of God our Saviour dawned upon the
world,
3Titus 3.5–12
6
5 then, not for any good deeds of our
own, but because he was merciful, he
saved us through the water of rebirth
and the renewing power of the Holy
Spirit,
6 which he lavished upon us through
Jesus Christ our Saviour,
7 so that, justified by his grace, we
might in hope become heirs to eternal
life.
8 That is a saying you may trust. SUCH
are the points I want you to insist on, so
that those who have come to believe in
God may be sure to devote themselves
to good works. These precepts are good
in themselves and also useful to society.
9 But avoid foolish speculations,
genealogies, quarrels, and controversies
over the law; they are unprofitable and
futile.
10 If someone is contentious, he should
be allowed a second warning; after that,
have nothing more to do with him,
11 recognizing that anyone like that
has a distorted mind and stands
self-condemned in his sin.
12 Once I have sent Artemas or Tychicus
to you, join me at Nicopolis as soon asTitus 3.13–15
7
you can, for that is where I have decided
to spend the winter.
13 Do your utmost to help Zenas the
lawyer and Apollos on their travels, and
see that they are not short of anything.
14 And our own people must be taught
to devote themselves to good works to
meet urgent needs; they must not be
unproductive.
15 All who are with me send you
greetings. My greetings to our friends in
the faith. Grace be with you all!Philemon
1 FROM Paul, a prisoner of Christ
1 Jesus, and our colleague Timothy,
to Philemon our dear friend and
fellow-worker,
2 together with Apphia our sister, and
Archippus our comrade-in-arms, and the
church that meets at your house.
3 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I thank my God always when I
mention you in my prayers,
5 for I hear of your love and faith
towards the Lord Jesus and for all God's
people.
6 My prayer is that the faith you hold
in common with us may deepen your
understanding of all the blessings which
belong to us as we are brought closer to
Christ.
7 Your love has brought me much joy
and encouragement; through you God's
people have been much refreshed.Philemon 1.8–16
2
8 ACCORDINGLY, although in Christ I
might feel free to dictate where your
duty lies,
9 yet, because of that same love, I
would rather appeal to you. Ambassador
as I am of Christ Jesus, and now his
prisoner,
10 I, Paul, appeal to you about my child,
whose father I have become in this
prison. I mean Onesimus,
11 once so useless to you, but now
useful indeed, both to you and to me.
12 In sending him back to you I am
sending my heart.
13 I should have liked to keep him with
me, to look after me on your behalf, here
in prison for the gospel,
14 but I did not want to do anything
without your consent, so that your
kindness might be a matter not of
compulsion, but of your own free will.
15 Perhaps this is why you lost him for a
time to receive him back for good --
16 no longer as a slave, but as more
than a slave: as a dear brother, very
dear to me, and still dearer to you, both
as a man and as a Christian.Philemon 1.17–25
3
17 If, then, you think of me as your
partner in the faith, welcome him as you
would welcome me.
18 If he did you any wrong and owes
you anything, put it down to my account.
19 Here is my signature: Paul. I will
repay you -- not to mention that you
owe me your very self.
20 Yes, brother, I am asking this favour
of you as a fellow-Christian; set my mind
at rest.
21 I write to you confident that you will
meet my wishes; I know that you will in
fact do more than I ask.
22 And one last thing: have a room
ready for me, for I hope through the
prayers of you all to be restored to you.
23 Epaphras, a captive of Christ Jesus
like myself, sends you greetings.
24 So do my fellow-workers Mark,
Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke.
25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit!Hebrews
1 WHEN in times past God spoke to
1 our forefathers, he spoke in many
and varied ways through the prophets.
2 But in this the final age he has spoken
to us in his Son, whom he has appointed
heir of all things; and through him he
created the universe.
3 He is the radiance of God's glory,
the stamp of God's very being, and
he sustains the universe by his word
of power. When he had brought about
purification from sins, he took his seat at
the right hand of God's Majesty on high,
4 raised as far above the angels as the
title he has inherited is superior to theirs.
5 To which of the angels did God ever
say, You are my son; today I have
become your father, or again, I shall be
his father, and he will be my son?
6 Again, when he presents the firstborn
to the world, he says, Let all God's
angels pay him homage.Hebrews 1.7–2.1
2
7 Of the angels he says: He makes his
angels winds, and his ministers flames
of fire;
8 but of the Son: Your throne, O God, is
for ever and ever, and the sceptre of his
kingdom is the sceptre of justice.
9 You have loved right and hated wrong;
therefore, O God, your God has set you
above your fellows by anointing you with
oil, the token of joy.
10 And again: By you, Lord, were earth's
foundations laid of old, and the heavens
are the work of your hands.
11 They will perish, but you remain; like
clothes they will all wear out.
12 You will fold them up like a cloak,
they will be changed like any garment.
But you are the same, and your years
will have no end.
13 To which of the angels has he ever
said, Sit at my right hand until I make
your enemies your footstool?
14 Are they not all ministering spirits
sent out in God's service, for the sake of
those destined to receive salvation?
1 That is why we are bound to pay all
the more heed to what we have been
told, for fear of drifting from our course.
2Hebrews 2.2–8
3
2 For if God's word spoken through
angels had such force that any violation
of it, or any disobedience, met with its
proper penalty,
3 what escape can there be for us if
we ignore so great a deliverance? This
deliverance was first announced through
the Lord, and those who heard him
confirmed it to us,
4 God himself adding his testimony by
signs and wonders, by miracles of many
kinds, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit
distributed at his own will.
5 For it is not to angels that he has
subjected the world to come, which is
our theme.
6 There is somewhere this solemn
assurance: What is man, that you should
remember him, a man, that you should
care for him?
7 You made him for a short while
subordinate to the angels; with glory
and honour you crowned him;
8 you put everything in subjection
beneath his feet. For in subjecting
everything to him, God left nothing that
is not made subject. But in fact we doHebrews 2.9–14
4
not yet see everything in subjection to
man.
9 What we do see is Jesus, who for a
short while was made subordinate to
the angels, crowned now with glory and
honour because he suffered death, so
that, by God's gracious will, he should
experience death for all mankind.
10 In bringing many sons to glory it was
fitting that God, for whom and through
whom all things exist, should make the
pioneer of their salvation perfect through
sufferings;
11 for he who consecrates and those
who are consecrated are all of one stock.
That is why he does not shrink from
calling men his brothers,
12 when he says, I will make your fame
known to my brothers; in the midst of
the assembly I will praise you;
13 and again, I will keep my trust fixed
on him; and again, Here am I, and the
children whom God has given me.
14 Since the children share in flesh and
blood, he too shared in them, so that by
dying he might break the power of him
who had death at his command, that is,
the devil,Hebrews 2.15–3.4
5
15 and might liberate those who all their
life had been in servitude through fear of
death.
16 Clearly they are not angels whom he
helps, but the descendants of Abraham.
17 Therefore he had to be made like his
brothers in every way, so that he might
be merciful and faithful as their high
priest before God, to make expiation for
the sins of the people.
18 Because he himself has passed
through the test of suffering, he is able
to help those who are in the midst of
their test.
1 (THEREFORE,) brothers in the
family of God, partners in a heavenly
calling, think of Jesus, the apostle and
high priest of the faith we profess:
2 he was faithful to God who appointed
him, as Moses also was faithful in God's
household;
3 but Jesus has been counted worthy
of greater honour than Moses, as the
founder of a house enjoys more honour
than his household.
4 Every house has its founder; and the
founder of all is God.
3Hebrews 3.5–13
6
5 Moses indeed was faithful as a servant
in God's whole household; his task was
to bear witness to the words that God
would speak;
6 but Christ is faithful as a son, set
over the household. And we are that
household, if only we are fearless and
keep our hope high.
7 TODAY, therefore, as the Holy Spirit
says -- Today if you hear his voice,
8 do not grow stubborn as in the
rebellion, at the time of testing in the
desert,
9 where your forefathers tried me and
tested me, though for forty years they
saw the things I did.
10 Therefore I was incensed with that
generation and said, Their hearts are for
ever astray; they would not discern my
ways;
11 so I vowed in my anger, they shall
never enter my rest.
12 See to it, my friends, that no one
among you has the wicked and faithless
heart of a deserter from the living God.
13 Rather, day by day, as long as
that word today sounds in your ears,Hebrews 3.14–4.2
7
encourage one another, so that no one of
you is made stubborn by the wiles of sin.
14 For we have become partners with
Christ, if only we keep our initial
confidence firm to the end.
15 When scripture says, Today if you
hear his voice, do not grow stubborn as
in the rebellion,
16 who was it that heard and yet
rebelled? All those, surely, whom Moses
had led out of Egypt.
17 And with whom was God indignant
for forty years? With those, surely, who
had sinned, whose bodies lay where they
fell in the desert.
18 And to whom did he vow that they
should not enter his rest, if not to those
who had refused to believe?
19 We see, then, it was unbelief that
prevented their entering.
1 What we must fear, therefore, is
that, while the promise of entering
his rest remains open, any one of you
should be found to have missed his
opportunity.
2 For indeed we have had the good
news preached to us, just as they had.
But the message they heard did them no
4Hebrews 4.3–10
8
good, for it was not combined with faith
in those who heard it.
3 Because we have faith, it is we who
enter that rest of which he has said:
As I vowed in my anger, they shall
never enter my rest. Yet God's work had
been finished ever since the world was
created.
4 Scripture somewhere says of the
seventh day: God rested from all his
work on the seventh day --
5 and in the passage above we read:
They shall never enter my rest.
6 This implies that some are to enter it,
and since those who first heard the good
news failed to enter through unbelief,
7 once more God sets a day. Today,
he says, speaking so many years later
in the words already quoted from the
Psalms: Today if you hear his voice, do
not grow stubborn.
8 If Joshua had given them rest, God
would not have spoken afterwards of
another day.
9 Therefore, a sabbath rest still awaits
the people of God;
10 anyone who enters God's rest, rests
from his own work, as God did from his.Hebrews 4.11–5.1
9
11 Let us, then, make every effort to
enter that rest, so that no one may fall
by following the old example of unbelief.
12 The word of God is alive and active.
It cuts more keenly than any two-edged
sword, piercing so deeply that it divides
soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it
discriminates among the purposes and
thoughts of the heart.
13 Nothing in creation can hide from
him; everything lies bare and exposed to
the eyes of him to whom we must render
account.
14 Since therefore we have a great
high priest who has passed through the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold fast to the faith we profess.
15 Ours is not a high priest unable to
sympathize with our weaknesses, but
one who has been tested in every way
as we are, only without sinning.
16 Let us therefore boldly approach the
throne of grace, in order that we may
receive mercy and find grace to give us
timely help.
1 FOR every high priest is taken from
among men and appointed their
5Hebrews 5.2–8
10
representative before God, to offer gifts
and sacrifices for sins.
2 He is able to bear patiently with the
ignorant and erring, since he too is beset
by weakness;
3 and because of this he is bound to
make sin-offerings for himself as well as
for the people.
4 Moreover nobody assumes the office
on his own authority: he is called by
God, just as Aaron was.
5 So it is with Christ: he did not confer
on himself the glory of becoming high
priest; it was granted by God, who said
to him, You are my son; today I have
become your father;
6 as also in another place he says, You
are a priest for ever, in the order of
Melchizedek.
7 In the course of his earthly life he
offered up prayers and petitions, with
loud cries and tears, to God who was
able to deliver him from death. Because
of his devotion his prayer was heard:
8 son though he was, he learned
obedience through his sufferings,Hebrews 5.9–6.1
11
9 and, once perfected, he became the
source of eternal salvation for all who
obey him,
10 and by God he was designated high
priest in the order of Melchizedek.
11 ABOUT Melchizedek we have much to
say, much that is difficult to explain to
you, now that you have proved so slow
to learn.
12 By this time you ought to be teachers,
but instead you need someone to teach
you the ABC of God's oracles over again.
It comes to this: you need milk instead
of solid food.
13 Anyone who lives on milk is still an
infant, with no experience of what is
right.
14 Solid food is for adults, whose
perceptions have been trained by long
use to discriminate between good and
evil.
1 Let us stop discussing the rudiments
of Christianity. We ought not to be
laying the foundation all over again:
repentance from the deadness of our
former ways and faith in God, by
means of instruction about cleansing
rites and the laying on of hands, the
6Hebrews 6.2–9
12
resurrection of the dead and eternal
judgement. Instead, let us advance
towards maturity;
2 (6:1)
3 and so we shall, if God permits.
4 For when people have once been
enlightened, when they have tasted the
heavenly gift and have shared in the
Holy Spirit,
5 when they have experienced the
goodness of God's word and the spiritual
power of the age to come,
6 and then after all this have fallen
away, it is impossible to bring them
afresh to repentance; for they are
crucifying to their own hurt the Son of
God and holding him up to mockery.
7 When the soil drinks in the rain that
falls often upon it, and yields a crop
for the use of those who cultivate it, it
receives its blessing from God;
8 but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is
worthless and a curse hangs over it; it
ends by being burnt.
9 Yet although we speak as we do, we
are convinced that you, dear friends, are
in a better state, which makes for your
salvation.Hebrews 6.10–18
13
10 For God is not so unjust as to forget
what you have done for love of his name
in rendering service to his people, as you
still do.
11 But we should dearly like each one of
you to show the same keenness to the
end, until your hope is fully realized.
12 We want you not to be lax, but
to imitate those who, through faith
and patience, receive the promised
inheritance.
13 When God made his promise to
Abraham, because he had no one greater
to swear by he swore by himself:
14 I vow that I will bless you abundantly
and multiply your descendants.
15 Thus it was that Abraham, after
patient waiting, obtained the promise.
16 People swear by what is greater than
themselves, and making a statement on
oath sets a limit to what can be called in
question;
17 and so, since God desired to show
even more clearly to the heirs of his
promise how immutable was his purpose,
he guaranteed it by an oath.
18 Here, then, are two irrevocable acts
in which God could not possibly play usHebrews 6.19–7.4
14
false. They give powerful encouragement
to us, who have laid claim to his
protection by grasping the hope set
before us.
19 We have that hope as an anchor for
our lives, safe and secure. It enters the
sanctuary behind the curtain,
20 where Jesus has entered on our
behalf as forerunner, having become
high priest for ever in the order of
Melchizedek.
1 THIS Melchizedek, king of Salem,
priest of God Most High, met
Abraham returning from the defeat of
the kings and blessed him;
2 and Abraham gave him a tithe of
everything as his share. His name, in the
first place, means king of righteousness;
next he is king of Salem, that is, king of
peace.
3 He has no father, no mother, no
ancestors; his life has no beginning and
no end. Bearing the likeness of the Son
of God, he remains a priest for all time.
4 Consider now how great he must be
for the patriarch Abraham to give him
his tithe from the finest of the spoil.
7Hebrews 7.5–11
15
5 The descendants of Levi who succeed
to the priestly office are required by the
law to tithe the people, that is, their
fellow-countrymen, although they too
are descendants of Abraham.
6 But Melchizedek, though he does not
share their ancestry, tithed Abraham
himself and gave his blessing to the man
who had been given the promises;
7 and, beyond all dispute, it is always
the lesser who is blessed by the greater.
8 Moreover, in the one instance tithes
are received by men who must die; but
in the other, by one whom scripture
affirms to be alive.
9 It might even be said that Levi, the
receiver of tithes, was himself tithed
through Abraham;
10 for he was still in his ancestor's loins
when Melchizedek met him.
11 Now if perfection had been attainable
through the levitical priesthood (on the
basis of which the people were given the
law), there would have been no need for
another kind of priest to arise, described
as being in the order of Melchizedek,
instead of in the order of Aaron.Hebrews 7.12–20
16
12 But a change of priesthood must
mean a change of law;
13 for he who is spoken of here belongs
to a different tribe, no member of which
has ever served at the altar.
14 It is beyond all doubt that our Lord
is sprung from Judah, a tribe to which
Moses made no reference in speaking of
priests.
15 What makes this still clearer is
that a new priest has arisen, one like
Melchizedek;
16 he owes his priesthood not to a
system of rules relating to descent but
to the power of a life that cannot be
destroyed.
17 For here is the testimony: You
are a priest for ever, in the order of
Melchizedek.
18 The earlier rules are repealed as
ineffective and useless,
19 since the law brought nothing
to perfection; and a better hope is
introduced, through which we draw near
to God.
20 Notice also that no oath was sworn
when the other men were made priests;
but for this priest an oath was swornHebrews 7.21–28
17
in the words addressed to him: The
Lord has sworn and will not go back on
his word, You are a priest for ever. In
the same way, God's oath shows how
superior is the covenant which Jesus
guarantees.
21 (7:20)
22 (7:20)
23 There have been many levitical
priests, because death prevents them
from continuing in office;
24 but Jesus holds a perpetual
priesthood, because he remains for ever.
25 That is why he is able to save
completely those who approach God
through him, since he is always alive to
plead on their behalf.
26 Such a high priest is indeed suited to
our need: he is holy, innocent, undefiled,
set apart from sinners, and raised high
above the heavens.
27 He has no need to offer sacrifices
daily, as the high priests do, first for
their own sins and then for those of the
people; he did this once for all when he
offered up himself.
28 The high priests appointed by the law
are men in all their weakness; but theHebrews 8.1–6
18
priest appointed by the words of the oath
which supersedes the law is the Son,
who has been made perfect for ever.
1 MY main point is: this is the kind
of high priest we have, and he has
taken his seat at the right hand of the
throne of Majesty in heaven,
2 a minister in the real sanctuary, the
tent set up by the Lord, not by man.
3 Every high priest is appointed to offer
gifts and sacrifices; hence, of necessity,
this one too had something to offer.
4 If he were on earth, he would not be
a priest at all, since there are already
priests to offer the gifts prescribed by
the law,
5 although the sanctuary in which they
minister is only a shadowy symbol of
the heavenly one. This is why Moses,
when he was about to put up the tent,
was instructed by God: See to it that
you make everything according to the
pattern shown you on the mountain.
6 But in fact the ministry which Jesus
has been given is superior to theirs, for
he is the mediator of a better covenant,
established on better promises.
8Hebrews 8.7–13
19
7 Had that first covenant been faultless,
there would have been no occasion to
look for a second to replace it.
8 But God finds fault with his people
when he says, The time is coming, says
the Lord, when I shall conclude a new
covenant with the house of Israel and
the house of Judah.
9 It will not be like the covenant I made
with their forefathers when I took them
by the hand to lead them out of Egypt;
because they did not abide by the terms
of that covenant, and so I abandoned
them, says the Lord.
10 For this is the covenant I shall
make with Israel after those days, says
the Lord: I shall set my laws in their
understanding and write them on their
hearts; I shall be their God, and they will
be my people.
11 They will not teach one another,
each saying to his fellow-citizen and his
brother, Know the Lord! For all of them
will know me, high and low alike;
12 I shall pardon their wicked deeds,
and their sins I shall remember no more.
13 By speaking of a new covenant, he
has pronounced the first one obsolete;Hebrews 9.1–7
20
and anything that is becoming obsolete
and growing old will shortly disappear.
1 THE first covenant had its
ordinances governing divine service
and its sanctuary, but it was an earthly
sanctuary.
2 An outer tent, called the Holy Place,
was set up to contain the lampstand, the
table, and the Bread of the Presence.
3 Beyond the second curtain was the
tent called the Most Holy Place.
4 Here were a gold incense-altar and
the Ark of the Covenant plated all over
with gold, in which were kept a gold jar
containing the manna, and Aaron's staff
which once budded, and the tablets of
the covenant;
5 and above the Ark were the cherubim
of God's glory, overshadowing the place
of expiation. These we need not discuss
in detail now.
6 Under this arrangement, the priests
are continually entering the first tent in
the performance of their duties;
7 but the second tent is entered by the
high priest alone, and that only once a
year. He takes with him the blood which
9Hebrews 9.8–13
21
he offers for himself and for the people's
inadvertent sins.
8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that
so long as the outer tent still stands,
the way into the sanctuary has not been
opened up.
9 All this is symbolic, pointing to
the present time. It means that the
prescribed offerings and sacrifices cannot
give the worshipper a clear conscience
and so bring him to perfection;
10 they are concerned only with food
and drink and various rites of cleansing
-- external ordinances in force until the
coming of the new order.
11 But now Christ has come, high priest
of good things already in being. The tent
of his priesthood is a greater and more
perfect one, not made by human hands,
that is, not belonging to this created
world;
12 the blood of his sacrifice is his own
blood, not the blood of goats and calves;
and thus he has entered the sanctuary
once for all and secured an eternal
liberation.
13 If sprinkling the blood of goats
and bulls and the ashes of a heiferHebrews 9.14–19
22
consecrates those who have been defiled
and restores their ritual purity,
14 how much greater is the power
of the blood of Christ; through the
eternal Spirit he offered himself without
blemish to God. His blood will cleanse
our conscience from the deadness of our
former ways to serve the living God.
15 That is why the new covenant or
testament of which he is mediator took
effect once a death had occurred, to
bring liberation from sins committed
under the former covenant; its purpose
is to enable those whom God has called
to receive the eternal inheritance he has
promised them.
16 Now where there is a testament it is
necessary for the death of the testator
to be established;
17 for a testament takes effect only
when a death has occurred: it has no
force while the testator is still alive.
18 Even the former covenant itself was
not inaugurated without blood,
19 for when Moses had told the
assembled people all the commandments
as set forth in the law, he took the blood
of calves, with water, scarlet wool, andHebrews 9.20–26
23
marjoram, and sprinkled the law book
itself and all the people,
20 saying, This is the blood of the
covenant which God commanded you to
keep.
21 In the same way he sprinkled the
blood over the tent and all the vessels of
divine service.
22 Indeed, under the law, it might almost
be said that everything is cleansed by
blood, and without the shedding of blood
there is no forgiveness.
23 IF, then, the symbols of heavenly
things required those sacrifices to
cleanse them, the heavenly things
themselves required still better
sacrifices;
24 for Christ has not entered a sanctuary
made by human hands which is only a
pointer to the reality; he has entered
heaven itself, to appear now before God
on our behalf.
25 It was not his purpose to offer himself
again and again, as the high priest
enters the sanctuary year after year with
blood not his own;
26 for then he would have had to suffer
repeatedly since the world was created.Hebrews 9.27–10.5
24
But as it is, he has appeared once for all
at the climax of history to abolish sin by
the sacrifice of himself.
27 Just as it is our human lot to die
once, with judgement to follow,
28 so Christ was offered once to bear
the sins of mankind, and will appear a
second time, not to deal with sin, but
to bring salvation to those who eagerly
await him.
1 THE law contains but a shadow
of the good things to come, not
the true picture. With the same sacrifices
offered year after year for all time,
it can never bring the worshippers to
perfection.
2 If it could, these sacrifices would
surely have ceased to be offered,
because the worshippers, cleansed once
for all, would no longer have any sense
of sin.
3 Instead, by these sacrifices sins are
brought to mind year after year,
4 because they can never be removed
by the blood of bulls and goats.
5 That is why, at Christ's coming into the
world, he says: Sacrifice and offering you
10Hebrews 10.6–13
25
did not desire, but you have prepared a
body for me.
6 Whole-offerings and sin-offerings you
did not delight in.
7 Then I said, Here I am: as it is written
of me in the scroll, I have come, O God,
to do your will.
8 First he says, Sacrifices and offerings,
whole-offerings and sin-offerings, you
did not desire or delight in, although the
law prescribes them.
9 Then he adds, Here I am: I have come
to do your will. He thus abolishes the
former to establish the latter.
10 And it is by the will of God that we
have been consecrated, through the
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once
for all.
11 Daily every priest stands performing
his service and time after time offering
the same sacrifices, which can never
remove sins.
12 Christ, having offered for all time a
single sacrifice for sins, took his seat at
God's right hand,
13 where he now waits until his enemies
are made his footstool.Hebrews 10.14–23
26
14 So by one offering he has perfected
for ever those who are consecrated by it.
15 To this the Holy Spirit also adds his
witness. First he says,
16 This is the covenant which I will make
with them after those days, says the
Lord: I will set my laws in their hearts
and write them on their understanding;
17 then he adds, and their sins and
wicked deeds I will remember no more.
18 And where these have been forgiven,
there are no further offerings for sin.
19 SO NOW, my friends, the blood
of Jesus makes us free to enter the
sanctuary with confidence
20 by the new and living way which he
has opened for us through the curtain,
the way of his flesh.
21 We have a great priest set over the
household of God;
22 so let us make our approach in
sincerity of heart and the full assurance
of faith, inwardly cleansed from a guilty
conscience, and outwardly washed with
pure water.
23 Let us be firm and unswerving in the
confession of our hope, for the giver of
the promise is to be trusted.Hebrews 10.24–30
27
24 We ought to see how each of us may
best arouse others to love and active
goodness.
25 We should not stay away from
our meetings, as some do, but rather
encourage one another, all the more
because we see the day of the Lord
drawing near.
26 For if we deliberately persist in sin
after receiving the knowledge of the
truth, there can be no further sacrifice
for sins; there remains
27 only a terrifying expectation of
judgement, of a fierce fire which will
consume God's enemies.
28 Anyone who flouts the law of Moses
is put to death without mercy on the
evidence of two or three witnesses.
29 Think how much more severe a
penalty will be deserved by anyone who
has trampled underfoot the Son of God,
profaned the blood of the covenant by
which he was consecrated, and insulted
God's gracious Spirit!
30 For we know who it is that said,
Justice is mine: I will repay; and again,
The Lord will judge his people.Hebrews 10.31–39
28
31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.
32 Remember those early days when,
newly enlightened, you met the test of
great suffering and held firm.
33 Some of you were publicly exposed to
abuse and tormented, while others stood
loyally by those who were so treated.
34 For indeed you shared the sufferings
of those who were in prison, and you
cheerfully accepted the seizure of your
possessions, knowing that you had a
better, more lasting possession.
35 Do not, therefore, throw away your
confidence, for it carries a great reward.
36 You need endurance in order to do
God's will and win what he has promised.
37 For, in the words of scripture, very
soon he who is to come will come; he
will not delay;
38 and by faith my righteous servant
shall find life; but if anyone shrinks back,
I take no pleasure in him.
39 But we are not among those who
shrink back and are lost; we have the
faith to preserve our life.Hebrews 11.1–7
29
1 FAITH gives substance to our
11 hopes and convinces us of
realities we do not see.
2 It was for their faith that the people of
old won God's approval.
3 By faith we understand that the
universe was formed by God's command,
so that the visible came forth from the
invisible.
4 By faith Abel offered a greater sacrifice
than Cain's; because of his faith God
approved his offerings and attested his
goodness; and through his faith, though
he is dead, he continues to speak.
5 By faith Enoch was taken up to another
life without passing through death; he
was not to be found, because God had
taken him, and it is the testimony of
scripture that before he was taken he
had pleased God.
6 But without faith it is impossible to
please him, for whoever comes to God
must believe that he exists and rewards
those who seek him.
7 By faith Noah took good heed of the
divine warning about the unseen future,
and built an ark to save his household.
Through his faith he put the whole worldHebrews 11.8–13
30
in the wrong, and made good his own
claim to the righteousness which comes
of faith.
8 By faith Abraham obeyed the call to
leave his home for a land which he was
to receive as a possession; he went away
without knowing where he was to go.
9 By faith he settled as an alien in the
land which had been promised him,
living in tents with Isaac and Jacob,
who were heirs with him to the same
promise.
10 For he was looking forward to a city
with firm foundations, whose architect
and builder is God.
11 By faith even Sarah herself was
enabled to conceive, though she was
past the age, because she judged that
God who had promised would keep faith.
12 Therefore from one man, a man as
good as dead, there sprang descendants
as numerous as the stars in the heavens
or the countless grains of sand on the
seashore.
13 All these died in faith. Although they
had not received the things promised,
yet they had seen them far ahead and
welcomed them, and acknowledgedHebrews 11.14–21
31
themselves to be strangers and aliens
without fixed abode on earth.
14 Those who speak in that way show
plainly that they are looking for a country
of their own.
15 If their thoughts had been with the
country they had left, they could have
found opportunity to return.
16 Instead, we find them longing for a
better country, a heavenly one. That is
why God is not ashamed to be called
their God; for he has a city ready for
them.
17 By faith Abraham, when put to the
test, offered up Isaac: he had received
the promises, and yet he was ready to
offer his only son,
18 of whom he had been told, Through
the line of Isaac your descendants shall
be traced.
19 For he reckoned that God had power
even to raise from the dead -- and it
was from the dead, in a sense, that he
received him back.
20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
and spoke of things to come.
21 By faith Jacob, as he was dying,
blessed each of Joseph's sons, andHebrews 11.22–28
32
bowed in worship over the top of his
staff.
22 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life,
spoke of the departure of Israel from
Egypt, and gave instructions about his
burial.
23 By faith, when Moses was born,
his parents hid him for three months,
because they saw what a fine child he
was; they were not intimidated by the
king's edict.
24 By faith Moses, when he grew up,
refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's
daughter,
25 preferring to share hardship with
God's people rather than enjoy the
transient pleasures of sin.
26 He considered the stigma that rests
on God's Anointed greater wealth than
the treasures of Egypt, for his eyes were
fixed on the coming reward.
27 By faith he left Egypt, with no fear of
the king's anger; for he was resolute, as
one who saw the invisible God.
28 By faith he celebrated the Passover
and the sprinkling of blood, so that the
destroying angel might not touch the
firstborn of Israel.Hebrews 11.29–36
33
29 By faith they crossed the Red Sea as
though it were dry land, whereas the
Egyptians, when they attempted the
crossing, were engulfed.
30 By faith the walls of Jericho were
made to fall after they had been encircled
on seven successive days.
31 By faith the prostitute Rahab escaped
the fate of the unbelievers, because she
had given the spies a kindly welcome.
32 Need I say more? Time is too short
for me to tell the stories of Gideon,
Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, of David
and Samuel and the prophets.
33 Through faith they overthrew
kingdoms, established justice, saw God's
promises fulfilled. They shut the mouths
of lions,
34 quenched the fury of fire, escaped
death by the sword. Their weakness was
turned to strength, they grew powerful
in war, they put foreign armies to rout.
35 Women received back their dead
raised to life. Others were tortured
to death, refusing release, to win
resurrection to a better life.
36 Others, again, had to face jeers and
flogging, even fetters and prison bars.Hebrews 11.37–12.2
34
37 They were stoned to death, they
were sawn in two, they were put to the
sword, they went about clothed in skins
of sheep or goats, deprived, oppressed,
ill-treated.
38 The world was not worthy of them.
They were refugees in deserts and on
the mountains, hiding in caves and holes
in the ground.
39 All these won God's approval because
of their faith; and yet they did not
receive what was promised,
40 because, with us in mind, God had
made a better plan, that only with us
should they reach perfection.
1 WITH this great cloud
of witnesses around us,
therefore, we too must throw off every
encumbrance and the sin that all
too readily restricts us, and run with
resolution the race which lies ahead of
us,
2 our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer
and perfecter of faith. For the sake of the
joy that lay ahead of him, he endured
the cross, ignoring its disgrace, and has
taken his seat at the right hand of the
throne of God.
12Hebrews 12.3–10
35
3 Think of him who submitted to such
opposition from sinners: that will help
you not to lose heart and grow faint.
4 In the struggle against sin, you have
not yet resisted to the point of shedding
your blood.
5 You have forgotten the exhortation
which addresses you as sons: My son, do
not think lightly of the Lord's discipline,
or be discouraged when he corrects you;
6 for whom the Lord loves he
disciplines; he chastises every son whom
he acknowledges.
7 You must endure it as discipline: God
is treating you as sons. Can anyone be a
son and not be disciplined by his father?
8 If you escape the discipline in which
all sons share, you must be illegitimate
and not true sons.
9 Again, we paid due respect to our
human fathers who disciplined us;
should we not submit even more readily
to our spiritual Father, and so attain life?
10 They disciplined us for a short time
as they thought best; but he does so for
our true welfare, so that we may share
his holiness.Hebrews 12.11–18
36
11 Discipline, to be sure, is never
pleasant; at the time it seems painful,
but afterwards those who have been
trained by it reap the harvest of a
peaceful and upright life.
12 So brace your drooping arms and
shaking knees,
13 and keep to a straight path; then the
weakened limb will not be put out of
joint, but will regain its former powers.
14 AIM at peace with everyone and a
holy life, for without that no one will see
the Lord.
15 Take heed that there is no one among
you who forfeits the grace of God, no
bitter, noxious weed growing up to
contaminate the rest,
16 no immoral person, no one worldly-
minded like Esau. He sold his birthright
for a single meal,
17 and you know that afterwards,
although he wanted to claim the
blessing, he was rejected; though he
begged for it to the point of tears, he
found no way open for a change of mind.
18 IT is not to the tangible, blazing fire
of Sinai that you have come, with its
darkness, gloom, and whirlwind,Hebrews 12.19–26
37
19 its trumpet-blast and oracular voice,
which the people heard and begged to
hear no more;
20 for they could not bear the command,
If even an animal touches the mountain,
it must be stoned to death.
21 So appalling was the sight that Moses
said, I shudder with fear.
22 No, you have come to Mount Zion,
the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, to myriads of angels,
23 to the full concourse and assembly of
the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven,
and to God the judge of all, and to the
spirits of good men made perfect,
24 and to Jesus the mediator of a new
covenant, whose sprinkled blood has
better things to say than the blood of
Abel.
25 See that you do not refuse to hear the
voice that speaks. Those who refused to
hear the oracle speaking on earth found
no escape; still less shall we escape if
we reject him who speaks from heaven.
26 Then indeed his voice shook the
earth, but now he has promised, Once
again I will shake not only the earth, but
the heavens also.Hebrews 12.27–13.5
38
27 The words once again point to the
removal of all created things, of all that
is shaken, so that what cannot be shaken
may remain.
28 The kingdom we are given is
unshakeable; let us therefore give
thanks to God for it, and so worship
God as he would be worshipped, with
reverence and awe;
29 for our God is a devouring fire.
1 NEVER cease to love your
fellow-Christians.
2 Do not neglect to show hospitality;
by doing this, some have entertained
angels unawares.
3 Remember those in prison, as if you
were there with them, and those who are
being maltreated, for you are vulnerable
too.
4 Marriage must be honoured by all, and
the marriage bond be kept inviolate; for
God's judgement will fall on fornicators
and adulterers.
5 Do not live for money; be content with
what you have, for God has said, I will
never leave you or desert you.
13Hebrews 13.6–13
39
6 So we can take courage and say, The
Lord is my helper, I will not fear; what
can man do to me?
7 Remember your leaders, who spoke
God's message to you. Keep before you
the outcome of their life and follow the
example of their faith.
8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
today, and for ever.
9 So do not be swept off your course
by all sorts of outlandish teachings; it is
good that we should gain inner strength
from the grace of God, and not from
rules about food, which have never
benefited those who observed them.
10 Our altar is one from which the
priests of the sacred tent have no right
to eat.
11 As you know, the animals whose
blood is brought by the high priest into
the sanctuary as a sin-offering have their
bodies burnt outside the camp.
12 Therefore, to consecrate the people
by his own blood, Jesus also suffered
outside the gate.
13 Let us then go to him outside the
camp, bearing the stigma that he bore.Hebrews 13.14–21
40
14 For here we have no lasting city, but
we are seekers after the city which is to
come.
15 Through Jesus let us continually offer
up to God a sacrifice of praise, that is,
the tribute of lips which acknowledge his
name.
16 Never neglect to show kindness and
to share what you have with others;
for such are the sacrifices which God
approves.
17 Obey your leaders and submit to their
authority; for they are tireless in their
care for you, as those who must render
an account. See that their work brings
them happiness, not pain and grief, for
that would be no advantage to you.
18 Pray for us. We are sure that our
conscience is clear, and our desire is
always to do what is right.
19 I specially ask for your prayers, so
that I may be restored to you the sooner.
20 May the God of peace, who brought
back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the
great Shepherd of the sheep, through
the blood of an eternal covenant,
21 make you perfect in all goodness so
that you may do his will; and may heHebrews 13.22–25
41
create in us what is pleasing to him,
through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
for ever and ever! Amen.
22 I beg you, friends, bear with my
appeal; for this is after all a short letter.
23 I have news for you: our friend
Timothy has been released; and if he
comes in time he will be with me when I
see you.
24 Greet all your leaders and all God's
people. Greetings to you from our Italian
friends.
25 God's grace be with you all!James
1 FROM James, a servant of God and
1 the Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to
the twelve tribes dispersed throughout
the world.
2 MY friends, whenever you have to
face all sorts of trials, count yourselves
supremely happy
3 in the knowledge that such testing of
your faith makes for strength to endure.
4 Let endurance perfect its work in you
that you may become perfected, sound
throughout, lacking in nothing.
5 If any of you lacks wisdom, he should
ask God and it will be given him, for God
is a generous giver who neither grudges
nor reproaches anyone.
6 But he who asks must ask in faith,
with never a doubt in his mind; for the
doubter is like a wave of the sea tossed
hither and thither by the wind.
7 A man like that should not think he
will receive anything from the Lord.
8 He is always in two minds and unstable
in all he does.James 1.9–17
2
9 The church member in humble
circumstances does well to take pride in
being exalted;
10 the wealthy member must find his
pride in being brought low, for the rich
man will disappear like a wild flower;
11 once the sun is up with its scorching
heat, it parches the plant, its flower
withers, and what was lovely to look at is
lost for ever. So shall the rich man fade
away as he goes about his business.
12 Happy is the man who stands up to
trial! Having passed that test he will
receive in reward the life which God has
promised to those who love him.
13 No one when tempted should say,
I am being tempted by God; for God
cannot be tempted by evil and does not
himself tempt anyone.
14 Temptation comes when anyone is
lured and dragged away by his own
desires;
15 then desire conceives and gives birth
to sin, and sin when it is full-grown
breeds death.
16 Make no mistake, my dear friends.
17 Every good and generous action and
every perfect gift come from above,James 1.18–25
3
from the Father who created the lights of
heaven. With him there is no variation,
no play of passing shadows.
18 Of his own choice, he brought us to
birth by the word of truth to be a kind of
firstfruits of his creation.
19 Of that you may be certain, my dear
friends. But everyone should be quick
to listen, slow to speak, and slow to be
angry.
20 For human anger does not promote
God's justice.
21 Then discard everything sordid, and
every wicked excess, and meekly accept
the message planted in your hearts, with
its power to save you.
22 Only be sure you act on the message,
and do not merely listen and so deceive
yourselves.
23 Anyone who listens to the message
but does not act on it is like somebody
looking in a mirror at the face nature
gave him;
24 he glances at himself and goes his
way, and promptly forgets what he
looked like.
25 But he who looks into the perfect law,
the law that makes us free, and does notJames 1.26–2.4
4
turn away, remembers what he hears;
he acts on it, and by so acting he will
find happiness.
26 If anyone thinks he is religious
but does not bridle his tongue, he is
deceiving himself; that man's religion is
futile.
27 A pure and faultless religion in the
sight of God the Father is this: to look
after orphans and widows in trouble
and to keep oneself untarnished by the
world.
1 MY friends, you believe in our Lord
Jesus Christ who reigns in glory and
you must always be impartial.
2 For instance, two visitors may enter
your meeting, one a well-dressed man
with gold rings, and the other a poor
man in grimy clothes.
3 Suppose you pay special attention to
the well-dressed man and say to him,
Please take this seat, while to the poor
man you say, You stand over there, or
sit here on the floor by my footstool,
4 do you not see that you are
discriminating among your members and
judging by wrong standards?
2James 2.5–11
5
5 Listen, my dear friends: has not God
chosen those who are poor in the eyes
of the world to be rich in faith and to
possess the kingdom he has promised to
those who love him?
6 And yet you have humiliated the poor
man. Moreover, are not the rich your
oppressors? Is it not they who drag you
into court
7 and pour contempt on the honoured
name by which God has claimed you?
8 If, however, you are observing the
sovereign law laid down in scripture,
Love your neighbour as yourself, that is
excellent.
9 But if you show partiality, you are
committing a sin and you stand convicted
by the law as offenders.
10 For if a man breaks just one
commandment and keeps all the others,
he is guilty of breaking all of them.
11 For he who said, You shall not commit
adultery, said also, You shall not commit
murder. If you commit murder you are a
breaker of the law, even if you do not
commit adultery as well.James 2.12–19
6
12 Always speak and act as men who are
to be judged under a law which makes
them free.
13 In that judgement there will be no
mercy for the man who has shown none.
Mercy triumphs over judgement.
14 WHAT good is it, my friends, for
someone to say he has faith when his
actions do nothing to show it? Can that
faith save him?
15 Suppose a fellow-Christian, whether
man or woman, is in rags with not
enough food for the day,
16 and one of you says, Goodbye, keep
warm, and have a good meal, but does
nothing to supply their bodily needs,
what good is that?
17 So with faith; if it does not lead to
action, it is by itself a lifeless thing.
18 But someone may say: One chooses
faith, another action. To which I reply:
Show me this faith you speak of with no
actions to prove it, while I by my actions
will prove to you my faith.
19 You have faith and believe that there
is one God. Excellent! Even demons
have faith like that, and it makes them
tremble.James 2.20–3.1
7
20 Do you have to be told, you fool, that
faith divorced from action is futile?
21 Was it not by his action, in offering
his son Isaac upon the altar, that our
father Abraham was justified?
22 Surely you can see faith was at work
in his actions, and by these actions his
faith was perfected?
23 Here was fulfilment of the words of
scripture: Abraham put his faith in God,
and that faith was counted to him as
righteousness, and he was called God's
friend.
24 You see then it is by action and not
by faith alone that a man is justified.
25 The same is true also of the prostitute
Rahab. Was she not justified by her
action in welcoming the messengers into
her house and sending them away by a
different route?
26 As the body is dead when there is no
breath left in it, so faith divorced from
action is dead.
1 MY friends, not many of you should
become teachers, for you may be
certain that we who teach will ourselves
face severer judgement.
3James 3.2–8
8
2 All of us go wrong again and again;
a man who never says anything wrong
is perfect and is capable of controlling
every part of his body.
3 When we put a bit into a horse's
mouth to make it obey our will, we can
direct the whole animal.
4 Or think of a ship: large though it may
be and driven by gales, it can be steered
by a very small rudder on whatever
course the helmsman chooses.
5 So with the tongue; it is small, but
its pretensions are great. What a vast
amount of timber can be set ablaze by
the tiniest spark!
6 And the tongue is a fire, representing
in our body the whole wicked world.
It pollutes our whole being, it sets the
whole course of our existence alight, and
its flames are fed by hell.
7 Beasts and birds of every kind,
creatures that crawl on the ground or
swim in the sea, can be subdued and
have been subdued by man;
8 but no one can subdue the tongue.
It is an evil thing, restless and charged
with deadly venom.James 3.9–16
9
9 We use it to praise our Lord and
Father; then we use it to invoke curses
on our fellow-men, though they are
made in God's likeness.
10 Out of the same mouth come praise
and curses. This should not be so, my
friends.
11 Does a fountain flow with both fresh
and brackish water from the same
outlet?
12 My friends, can a fig tree produce
olives, or a grape vine produce figs? No
more can salt water produce fresh.
13 WHICH of you is wise or learned? Let
him give practical proof of it by his right
conduct, with the modesty that comes of
wisdom.
14 But if you are harbouring bitter
jealousy and the spirit of rivalry in your
hearts, stop making false claims in
defiance of the truth.
15 This is not the wisdom that comes
from above; it is earth-bound, sensual,
demonic.
16 For with jealousy and rivalry come
disorder and the practice of every kind
of evil.James 3.17–4.5
10
17 But the wisdom from above is in the
first place pure; and then peace-loving,
considerate, and open-minded; it is
straightforward and sincere, rich in
compassion and in deeds of kindness
that are its fruit.
18 Peace is the seed-bed of
righteousness, and the peacemakers will
reap its harvest.
1 What causes fighting and quarrels
among you? Is not their origin the
appetites that war in your bodies?
2 You want what you cannot have,
so you murder; you are envious, and
cannot attain your ambition, so you
quarrel and fight. You do not get what
you want, because you do not pray for it.
3 Or, if you do, your requests are not
granted, because you pray from wrong
motives, in order to squander what you
get on your pleasures.
4 Unfaithful creatures! Surely you know
that love of the world means enmity to
God? Whoever chooses to be the world's
friend makes himself God's enemy.
5 Or do you suppose that scripture has
no point when it says that the spirit
4James 4.6–13
11
which God implanted in us is filled with
envious longings?
6 But the grace he gives is stronger;
thus scripture says, God opposes the
arrogant and gives grace to the humble.
7 Submit then to God. Stand up to the
devil, and he will turn and run.
8 Come close to God, and he will draw
close to you. Sinners, make your hands
clean; you whose motives are mixed,
see that your hearts are pure.
9 Be sorrowful, mourn, and weep. Turn
your laughter into mourning and your
gaiety into gloom.
10 Humble yourselves before the Lord,
and he will exalt you.
11 Friends, you must never speak ill
of one another. He who speaks ill of a
brother or passes judgement on him
speaks ill of the law and judges the law.
But if you judge the law, you are not
keeping it but sitting in judgement upon
it.
12 There is only one lawgiver and judge:
he who is able to save life or destroy it.
So who are you to judge your neighbour?
13 NOW A word with all who say, Today
or the next day we will go off to suchJames 4.14–5.4
12
and such a town and spend a year there
trading and making money.
14 Yet you have no idea what tomorrow
will bring. What is your life after all? You
are no more than a mist, seen for a little
while and then disappearing.
15 What you ought to say is: If it be the
Lord's will, we shall live to do so and so.
16 But instead, you boast and brag, and
all such boasting is wrong.
17 What it comes to is that anyone who
knows the right thing to do and does not
do it is a sinner.
1 Next a word to you who are rich.
Weep and wail over the miserable
fate overtaking you:
2 your riches have rotted away; your
fine clothes are moth-eaten;
3 your silver and gold have corroded,
and their corrosion will be evidence
against you and consume your flesh like
fire. You have piled up wealth in an age
that is near its close.
4 The wages you never paid to the
men who mowed your fields are crying
aloud against you, and the outcry of the
reapers has reached the ears of the Lord
of Hosts.
5James 5.5–12
13
5 You have lived on the land in wanton
luxury, gorging yourselves -- and that on
the day appointed for your slaughter.
6 You have condemned and murdered
the innocent one, who offers no
resistance.
7 YOU MUST be patient, my friends,
until the Lord comes. Consider: the
farmer looking for the precious crop from
his land can only wait in patience until
the early and late rains have fallen.
8 You too must be patient and stout-
hearted, for the coming of the Lord is
near.
9 My friends, do not blame your troubles
on one another, or you will fall under
judgement; and there at the door stands
the Judge.
10 As a pattern of patience under
ill-treatment, take the prophets who
spoke in the name of the Lord.
11 We count those happy who stood
firm. You have heard how Job stood firm,
and you have seen how the Lord treated
him in the end, for the Lord is merciful
and compassionate.
12 ABOVE all things, my friends, do not
use oaths, whether by heaven or byJames 5.13–18
14
earth or by anything else. When you
say Yes or No, let it be plain Yes or No,
for fear you draw down judgement on
yourselves.
13 Is anyone among you in trouble? Let
him pray. Is anyone in good heart? Let
him sing praises.
14 Is one of you ill? Let him send for the
elders of the church to pray over him
and anoint him with oil in the name of
the Lord;
15 the prayer offered in faith will heal
the sick man, the Lord will restore him
to health, and if he has committed sins
they will be forgiven.
16 Therefore confess your sins to one
another, and pray for one another, that
you may be healed. A good man's prayer
is very powerful and effective.
17 Elijah was a man just like us; yet
when he prayed fervently that there
should be no rain, the land had no rain
for three and a half years;
18 when he prayed again, the rain
poured down and the land bore crops
once more.James 5.19–20
15
19 My friends, if one of you strays
from the truth and another succeeds in
bringing him back,
20 you may be sure of this: the one who
brings a sinner back from his erring ways
will be rescuing a soul from death and
cancelling a multitude of sins.1 Peter
1 FROM Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ,
1 to the scattered people of God
now living as aliens in Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
2 chosen in the foreknowledge of God
the Father, by the consecrating work
of the Holy Spirit, for obedience to
Jesus Christ and sprinkling with his
blood. Grace and peace to you in fullest
measure.
3 PRAISED be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead, he gave us new birth into a living
hope,
4 the hope of an inheritance, reserved
in heaven for you, which nothing can
destroy or spoil or wither.
5 Because you put your faith in God, you
are under the protection of his power
until the salvation now in readiness is
revealed at the end of time.1 Peter 1.6–12
2
6 This is cause for great joy, even
though for a little while you may have
had to suffer trials of many kinds.
7 Even gold passes through the
assayer's fire, and much more precious
than perishable gold is faith which
stands the test. These trials come so
that your faith may prove itself worthy of
all praise, glory, and honour when Jesus
Christ is revealed.
8 You have not seen him, yet you love
him; and trusting in him now without
seeing him, you are filled with a glorious
joy too great for words,
9 while you are reaping the harvest of
your faith, that is, salvation for your
souls.
10 THIS salvation was the subject of
intense search by the prophets who
prophesied about the grace of God
awaiting you.
11 They tried to find out the time and
the circumstances to which the spirit of
Christ in them pointed, when it foretold
the sufferings in Christ's cause and the
glories to follow.
12 It was disclosed to them that these
matters were not for their benefit but1 Peter 1.13–18
3
for yours. Now they have been openly
announced to you through preachers
who brought you the gospel in the power
of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.
These are things that angels long to
glimpse.
13 Your minds must therefore be
stripped for action and fully alert. Fix
your hopes on the grace which is to be
yours when Jesus Christ is revealed.
14 Be obedient to God your Father, and
do not let your characters be shaped any
longer by the desires you cherished in
your days of ignorance.
15 He who called you is holy; like him,
be holy in all your conduct.
16 Does not scripture say, You shall be
holy, for I am holy?
17 If you say Father to him who judges
everyone impartially on the basis of what
they have done, you must live in awe of
him during your time on earth.
18 You know well that it was nothing of
passing value, like silver or gold, that
bought your freedom from the futility of
your traditional ways.1 Peter 1.19–25
4
19 You were set free by Christ's precious
blood, blood like that of a lamb without
mark or blemish.
20 He was predestined before the
foundation of the world, but in this last
period of time he has been revealed for
your sake.
21 Through him you have come to trust
in God who raised him from the dead
and gave him glory, and so your faith
and hope are fixed on God.
22 Now that you have purified your
souls by obedience to the truth until
you feel sincere affection towards your
fellow-Christians, love one another
wholeheartedly with all your strength.
23 You have been born again, not of
mortal but of immortal parentage,
through the living and enduring word of
God.
24 As scripture says: All mortals are like
grass; all their glory like the flower of the
field; the grass withers, the flower falls;
25 but the word of the Lord endures for
evermore. And this word is the gospel
which was preached to you.1 Peter 2.1–8
5
1 Then away with all wickedness and
2 deceit, hypocrisy and jealousy and
malicious talk of any kind!
2 Like the newborn infants you are,
you should be craving for pure spiritual
milk so that you may thrive on it and be
saved; for
3 surely you have tasted that the Lord
is good.
4 So come to him, to the living stone
which was rejected by men but chosen
by God and of great worth to him.
5 You also, as living stones, must be
built up into a spiritual temple, and
form a holy priesthood to offer spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God through
Jesus Christ.
6 For you will find in scripture: I am
laying in Zion a chosen corner-stone of
great worth. Whoever has faith in it will
not be put to shame.
7 So for you who have faith it has great
worth; but for those who have no faith
the stone which the builders rejected has
become the corner-stone,
8 and also a stone to trip over, a rock to
stumble against. They trip because they1 Peter 2.9–14
6
refuse to believe the word; this is the
fate appointed for them.
9 But you are a chosen race, a royal
priesthood, a dedicated nation, a people
claimed by God for his own, to proclaim
the glorious deeds of him who has called
you out of darkness into his marvellous
light.
10 Once you were not a people at all;
but now you are God's people. Once you
were outside his mercy; but now you are
outside no longer.
11 DEAR friends, I appeal to you, as
aliens in a foreign land, to avoid bodily
desires which make war on the soul.
12 Let your conduct among unbelievers
be so good that, although they now
malign you as wrongdoers, reflection on
your good deeds will lead them to give
glory to God on the day when he comes
in judgement.
13 Submit yourselves for the sake of the
Lord to every human authority, whether
to the emperor as supreme,
14 or to governors as his deputies for
the punishment of those who do wrong
and the commendation of those who do
right.1 Peter 2.15–21
7
15 For it is God's will that by doing
right you should silence ignorance and
stupidity.
16 Live as those who are free; not
however as though your freedom
provided a cloak for wrongdoing, but as
slaves in God's service.
17 Give due honour to everyone: love
your fellow-Christians, reverence God,
honour the emperor.
18 Servants, submit to your masters
with all due respect, not only to those
who are kind and forbearing, but even to
those who are unjust.
19 It is a sign of grace if, because God
is in his thoughts, someone endures the
pain of undeserved suffering.
20 What credit is there in enduring the
beating you deserve when you have
done wrong? On the other hand, when
you have behaved well and endured
suffering for it, that is a sign of grace in
the sight of God.
21 It is your vocation because Christ
himself suffered on your behalf, and left
you an example in order that you should
follow in his steps.1 Peter 2.22–3.4
8
22 He committed no sin, he was guilty
of no falsehood.
23 When he was abused he did not
retaliate, when he suffered he uttered
no threats, but delivered himself up to
him who judges justly.
24 He carried our sins in his own person
on the gibbet, so that we might cease
to live for sin and begin to live for
righteousness. By his wounds you have
been healed.
25 You were straying like sheep, but now
you have turned towards the Shepherd
and Guardian of your souls.
1 In the same way you women must
submit to your husbands, so that if
there are any of them who disbelieve the
gospel they may be won over without a
word being said,
2 by observing your chaste and
respectful behaviour.
3 Your beauty should lie, not in outward
adornment -- braiding the hair, wearing
gold ornaments, or dressing up in fine
clothes --
4 but in the inmost self, with its
imperishable quality of a gentle, quiet
31 Peter 3.5–10
9
spirit, which is of high value in the sight
of God.
5 This is how in past days the women of
God's people, whose hope was in him,
used to make themselves attractive,
submitting to their husbands.
6 Such was Sarah, who obeyed Abraham
and called him master. By doing good
and showing no fear, you have become
her daughters.
7 In the same way, you husbands must
show understanding in your married
life: treat your wives with respect, not
only because they are physically weaker,
but also because God's gift of life is
something you share together. Then
your prayers will not be impeded.
8 Finally, be united, all of you, in thought
and feeling; be full of brotherly affection,
kindly and humble.
9 Do not repay wrong with wrong, or
abuse with abuse; on the contrary,
respond with blessing, for a blessing is
what God intends you to receive. As
scripture says:
10 If anyone wants to love life and see
good days he must restrain his tongue
from evil and his lips from deceit;1 Peter 3.11–18
10
11 he must turn from wrong and do
good, seek peace and pursue it.
12 The Lord has eyes for the righteous,
and ears open to their prayers; but
the face of the Lord is set against
wrongdoers.
13 Who is going to do you harm if you
are devoted to what is good?
14 Yet if you should suffer for doing
right you may count yourselves happy.
Have no fear of other people: do not be
perturbed,
15 but hold Christ in your hearts in
reverence as Lord. Always be ready
to make your defence when anyone
challenges you to justify the hope which
is in you. But do so with courtesy and
respect,
16 keeping your conscience clear, so
that when you are abused, those who
malign your Christian conduct may be
put to shame.
17 It is better to suffer for doing right, if
such should be the will of God, than for
doing wrong.
18 Christ too suffered for our sins once
and for all, the just for the unjust, that
he might bring us to God; put to death1 Peter 3.19–4.1
11
in the body, he was brought to life in the
spirit.
19 In the spirit also he went and made
his proclamation to the imprisoned
spirits,
20 those who had refused to obey in the
past, while God waited patiently in the
days when Noah was building the ark; in
it a few people, eight in all, were brought
to safety through the water.
21 This water symbolized baptism,
through which you are now brought to
safety. Baptism is not the washing away
of bodily impurities but the appeal made
to God from a good conscience; and it
brings salvation through the resurrection
of Jesus Christ,
22 who is now at the right hand of God,
having entered heaven and received the
submission of angels, authorities, and
powers.
1 SINCE Christ endured bodily
suffering, you also must arm
yourselves with the same disposition.
When anyone has endured bodily
suffering he has finished with sin,
41 Peter 4.2–9
12
2 so that for the rest of his days on
earth he may live, not to satisfy human
appetites, but to do what God wills.
3 You have spent time enough in the
past doing what pagans like to do. You
lived then in licence and debauchery,
drunkenness, orgies and carousal, and
the forbidden worship of idols.
4 Now, when you no longer plunge
with the pagans into all this reckless
dissipation, they cannot understand it
and start abusing you;
5 but they will have to give account of
themselves to him who is ready to pass
judgement on the living and the dead.
6 That was why the gospel was preached
even to the dead: in order that, although
in the body they were condemned to die
as everyone dies, yet in the spirit they
might live as God lives.
7 The end of all things is upon us;
therefore to help you to pray you must
lead self-controlled and sober lives.
8 Above all, maintain the fervour of
your love for one another, because love
cancels a host of sins.
9 Be hospitable to one another without
grumbling.1 Peter 4.10–15
13
10 As good stewards of the varied gifts
given you by God, let each use the gift
he has received in service to others.
11 Are you a speaker? Speak as one
who utters God's oracles. Do you give
service? Give it in the strength which
God supplies. In all things let God be
glorified through Jesus Christ; to him
belong glory and power for ever and
ever. Amen.
12 DEAR friends, do not be taken aback
by the fiery ordeal which has come to
test you, as though it were something
extraordinary.
13 On the contrary, in so far as it gives
you a share in Christ's sufferings, you
should rejoice; and then when his glory
is revealed, your joy will be unbounded.
14 If you are reviled for being Christians,
count yourselves happy, because the
Spirit of God in all his glory rests upon
you.
15 If you do suffer, it must not be
for murder, theft, or any other crime,
nor should it be for meddling in other
people's business.1 Peter 4.16–5.3
14
16 But if anyone suffers as a Christian,
he should feel it no disgrace, but confess
that name to the honour of God.
17 The time has come for the judgement
to begin; it is beginning with God's own
household. And if it is starting with us,
how will it end for those who refuse to
obey the gospel of God?
18 Scripture says: It is hard enough for
the righteous to be saved; what then will
become of the impious and sinful?
19 So let those who suffer according to
God's will entrust their souls to him while
continuing to do good; their Maker will
not fail them.
1 NOW I APPEAL to the elders of your
community, as a fellow-elder and a
witness to Christ's sufferings, and as
one who has shared in the glory to be
revealed:
2 look after the flock of God whose
shepherds you are; do it, not under
compulsion, but willingly, as God would
have it; not for gain but out of sheer
devotion;
3 not lording it over your charges, but
setting an example to the flock.
51 Peter 5.4–11
15
4 So when the chief shepherd appears,
you will receive glory, a crown that never
fades.
5 In the same way the younger men
should submit to the older. You should all
clothe yourselves with humility towards
one another, because God sets his face
against the arrogant but shows favour to
the humble.
6 Humble yourselves, then, under God's
mighty hand, and in due time he will lift
you up.
7 He cares for you, so cast all your
anxiety on him.
8 Be on the alert! Wake up! Your enemy
the devil, like a roaring lion, prowls
around looking for someone to devour.
9 Stand up to him, firm in your faith, and
remember that your fellow-Christians in
this world are going through the same
kinds of suffering.
10 After your brief suffering, the God of
all grace, who called you to his eternal
glory in Christ, will himself restore,
establish, and strengthen you on a firm
foundation.
11 All power belongs to him for ever and
ever! Amen.1 Peter 5.12–14
16
12 I WRITE you this brief letter
through Silvanus, whom I know to be a
trustworthy colleague, to encourage you
and to testify that this is the true grace
of God; in this stand fast.
13 Greetings from your sister church in
Babylon, and from my son Mark.
14 Greet one another with a loving kiss.
Peace to you all who belong to Christ!2 Peter
1 FROM Simeon Peter, servant and
1 apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who
share equally with us in the privileges of
faith through the righteousness of our
God and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2 Grace and peace be yours in fullest
measure, through knowledge of God and
of Jesus our Lord.
3 GOD'S divine power has bestowed on
us everything that makes for life and
true religion, through our knowledge of
him who called us by his own glory and
goodness.
4 In this way he has given us his
promises, great beyond all price, so
that through them you may escape the
corruption with which lust has infected
the world, and may come to share in the
very being of God.
5 With all this in view, you should make
every effort to add virtue to your faith,
knowledge to virtue,
6 self-control to knowledge, fortitude to
self-control, piety to fortitude,2 Peter 1.7–16
2
7 brotherly affection to piety, and love
to brotherly affection.
8 If you possess and develop these gifts,
you will grow actively and effectively in
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 Whoever lacks them is wilfully blind;
he has forgotten that his past sins were
washed away.
10 All the more then, my friends, do
your utmost to establish that God has
called and chosen you. If you do this,
you will never stumble,
11 and there will be rich provision for
your entry into the eternal kingdom of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
12 I shall keep reminding you of all
this, although you know it and are well
grounded in the truth you possess;
13 yet I think it right to keep on
reminding you as long as I still lodge in
this body.
14 I know I must soon leave it, as our
Lord Jesus Christ told me.
15 But I will do my utmost to ensure
that after I am gone you will always be
able to call these things to mind.
16 It was not on tales, however cleverly
concocted, that we relied when we told2 Peter 1.17–2.1
3
you about the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ and his coming; rather with our
own eyes we had witnessed his majesty.
17 He was invested with honour and
glory by God the Father, and there came
to him from the sublime Presence a voice
which said: This is my Son, my Beloved,
on whom my favour rests.
18 We ourselves heard this voice when
it came from heaven, for we were with
him on the sacred mountain.
19 All this confirms for us the message
of the prophets, to which you will do
well to attend; it will go on shining like a
lamp in a murky place, until day breaks
and the morning star rises to illuminate
your minds.
20 BUT first note this: no prophetic
writing is a matter for private
interpretation.
21 It was not on any human initiative
that prophecy came; rather, it was under
the compulsion of the Holy Spirit that
people spoke as messengers of God.
1 IN the past there were also false
prophets among the people, just as
you also will have false teachers among
you. They will introduce their destructive
22 Peter 2.2–7
4
views, disowning the very Master who
redeemed them, and bringing swift
destruction on their own heads.
2 They will gain many adherents to
their dissolute practices, through whom
the way of truth will be brought into
disrepute.
3 In their greed for money they will
trade on your credulity with sheer
fabrications. But judgement has long
been in preparation for them; destruction
waits for them with unsleeping eyes.
4 God did not spare the angels who
sinned, but consigned them to the dark
pits of hell, where they are held for
judgement.
5 Nor did he spare the world in ancient
times (except for Noah, who proclaimed
righteousness, and was preserved with
seven others), but brought the flood
upon that world with its godless people.
6 God reduced the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah to ashes, condemning them
to total ruin as an object-lesson for the
ungodly in future days.
7 But he rescued Lot, a good man
distressed by the dissolute habits of the
lawless society in which he lived;2 Peter 2.8–14
5
8 day after day every sight and sound of
their evil ways tortured that good man's
heart.
9 The Lord knows how to rescue the
godly from their trials, and to keep the
wicked under punishment until the day
of judgement.
10 Above all he will punish those who
follow their abominable lusts and flout
authority. Reckless and headstrong, they
are not afraid to insult celestial beings,
11 whereas angels, for all their superior
strength and power, employ no insults in
seeking judgement against them before
the Lord.
12 These men are like brute beasts,
mere creatures of instinct, born to be
caught and killed. They pour abuse upon
things they do not understand; they will
perish like the beasts,
13 suffering hurt for the hurt they have
inflicted. To carouse in broad daylight
is their idea of pleasure; while they sit
with you at table they are an ugly blot
on your company, because they revel in
their deceits.
14 They have eyes for nothing but loose
women, eyes never resting from sin.2 Peter 2.15–20
6
They lure the unstable to their ruin;
experts in mercenary greed, God's curse
is on them!
15 They have abandoned the straight
road and gone astray. They have
followed in the steps of Balaam son of
Bosor, who eagerly accepted payment
for doing wrong,
16 but had his offence brought home to
him when a dumb beast spoke with a
human voice and checked the prophet's
madness.
17 These men are springs that give no
water, mists driven by a storm; the place
reserved for them is blackest darkness.
18 They utter empty bombast; they use
sensual lusts and debauchery as a bait to
catch people who have only just begun
to escape from their pagan associates.
19 They promise them freedom, but
are themselves slaves of corruption; for
people are the slaves of whatever has
mastered them.
20 If they escaped the world's
defilements through coming to know
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and
entangled themselves in them again,2 Peter 2.21–3.4
7
and were mastered by them, their last
state would be worse than the first.
21 Better for them never to have known
the right way, than, having known it,
to turn back and abandon the sacred
commandment entrusted to them!
22 In their case the proverb has proved
true: The dog returns to its vomit, and
The washed sow wallows in the mud
again.
1 (THIS,) dear friends, is now my
second letter to you. In both I have
been recalling to you what you already
know, to rouse you to honest thought.
2 Remember the predictions made
by God's own prophets, and the
commandment given by the Lord and
Saviour through your apostles.
3 First of all, note this: in the last
days there will come scoffers who live
self-indulgent lives; they will mock you
and say:
4 What has happened to his promised
coming? Our fathers have been laid to
rest, but still everything goes on exactly
as it always has done since the world
began.
32 Peter 3.5–11
8
5 In maintaining this they forget that
there were heavens and earth long ago,
created by God's word out of water and
with water;
6 and that the first world was destroyed
by water, the water of the flood.
7 By God's word the present heavens
and earth are being reserved for
burning; they are being kept until the
day of judgement when the godless will
be destroyed.
8 Here is something, dear friends, which
you must not forget: in the Lord's sight
one day is like a thousand years and a
thousand years like one day.
9 It is not that the Lord is slow in
keeping his promise, as some suppose,
but that he is patient with you. It is not
his will that any should be lost, but that
all should come to repentance.
10 But the day of the Lord will come
like a thief. On that day the heavens will
disappear with a great rushing sound,
the elements will be dissolved in flames,
and the earth with all that is in it will be
brought to judgement.
11 Since the whole universe is to
dissolve in this way, think what sort of2 Peter 3.12–17
9
people you ought to be, what devout and
dedicated lives you should live!
12 Look forward to the coming of the
day of God, and work to hasten it on;
that day will set the heavens ablaze
until they fall apart, and will melt the
elements in flames.
13 Relying on his promise we look
forward to new heavens and a new
earth, in which justice will be established.
14 In expectation of all this, my friends,
do your utmost to be found at peace with
him, unblemished and above reproach.
15 Bear in mind that our Lord's patience
is an opportunity for salvation, as Paul,
our dear friend and brother, said when
he wrote to you with the wisdom God
gave him.
16 He does the same in all his other
letters, wherever he speaks about this,
though they contain some obscure
passages, which the ignorant and
unstable misinterpret to their own ruin,
as they do the other scriptures.
17 So, dear friends, you have been
forewarned. Take care not to let these
unprincipled people seduce you with2 Peter 3.18
10
their errors; do not lose your own safe
foothold.
18 But grow in grace and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ. To him be glory both now and for
all eternity!1 John
1 IT was there from the beginning;
1 we have heard it; we have seen it
with our own eyes; we looked upon
it, and felt it with our own hands: our
theme is the Word which gives life.
2 This life was made visible; we have
seen it and bear our testimony; we
declare to you the eternal life which was
with the Father and was made visible to
us.
3 It is this which we have seen and
heard that we declare to you also, in
order that you may share with us in a
common life, that life which we share
with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ.
4 We are writing this in order that our
joy may be complete.
5 HERE is the message we have heard
from him and pass on to you: God is
light, and in him there is no darkness at
all.
6 If we claim to be sharing in his life
while we go on living in darkness, our
words and our lives are a lie.1 John 1.7–2.5
2
7 But if we live in the light as he himself
is in the light, then we share a common
life, and the blood of Jesus his Son
cleanses us from all sin.
8 If we claim to be sinless, we are
self-deceived and the truth is not in us.
9 If we confess our sins, he is just
and may be trusted to forgive our sins
and cleanse us from every kind of
wrongdoing.
10 If we say we have committed no sin,
we make him out to be a liar and his
word has no place in us.
1 My children, I am writing this to you
so that you should not commit sin.
But if anybody does, we have in Jesus
Christ one who is acceptable to God and
will plead our cause with the Father.
2 He is himself a sacrifice to atone for
our sins, and not ours only but the sins
of the whole world.
3 It is by keeping God's commands that
we can be sure we know him.
4 Whoever says, I know him, but does
not obey his commands, is a liar and the
truth is not in him;
5 but whoever is obedient to his word,
in him the love of God is truly made
21 John 2.6–13
3
perfect. This is how we can be sure that
we are in him:
6 whoever claims to be dwelling in him
must live as Christ himself lived.
7 Dear friends, it is no new command
that I am sending you, but an old
command which you have had from
the beginning; the old command is
the instruction which you have already
received.
8 Yet because the darkness is passing
away and the true light already shining,
it is a new command that I write and it
is true in Christ's life and in yours.
9 Whoever says, I am in the light, but
hates his fellow-Christian, is still in
darkness.
10 He who loves his fellow-Christian
dwells in light: there is no cause of
stumbling in him.
11 But anyone who hates his fellow is in
darkness; he walks in the dark and has
no idea where he is going, because the
darkness has made him blind.
12 I write to you, children, because your
sins have been forgiven for his sake.
13 I write to you, fathers, because you
know him who is and has been from the1 John 2.14–19
4
beginning. I write to you, young men,
because you have conquered the evil
one. I have written to you, children,
because you know the Father.
14 I have written to you, fathers,
because you know him who is and has
been from the beginning. I have written
to you, young men, because you are
strong; God's word remains in you, and
you have conquered the evil one.
15 Do not set your hearts on the world
or what is in it. Anyone who loves the
world does not love the Father.
16 Everything in the world, all that
panders to the appetites or entices the
eyes, all the arrogance based on wealth,
these spring not from the Father but
from the world.
17 That world with all its allurements is
passing away, but those who do God's
will remain for ever.
18 CHILDREN, this is the last hour! You
were told that an antichrist was to come.
Well, many antichrists have already
appeared, proof to us that this is indeed
the last hour.
19 They left our ranks, but never really
belonged to us; if they had, they would1 John 2.20–26
5
have stayed with us. They left so that it
might be clear that none of them belong
to us.
20 What is more, you have been
anointed by the Holy One, and so you all
have knowledge.
21 It is not because you are ignorant of
the truth that I have written to you, but
because you do know it, and know that
lies never come from the truth.
22 Anyone who denies that Jesus is the
Christ is nothing but a liar. He is the
antichrist, for he denies both the Father
and the Son:
23 to deny the Son is to be without the
Father; to acknowledge the Son is to
have the Father too.
24 You must therefore keep hold of what
you heard at the beginning; if what you
heard then still dwells in you, you will
yourselves dwell both in the Son and in
the Father.
25 And this is the promise that he
himself gave us, the promise of eternal
life.
26 So much for those who would mislead
you.1 John 2.27–3.4
6
27 But as for you, the anointing which
you received from him remains with you;
you need no other teacher, but you learn
all you need to know from his anointing,
which is true and no lie. Dwell in him as
he taught you to do.
28 Even now, children, dwell in him,
so that when he appears we may be
confident and unashamed before him at
his coming.
29 You know that God is righteous; then
recognize that everyone who does what
is right is his child.
1 CONSIDER how great is the love
which the Father has bestowed on us
in calling us his children! For that is what
we are. The reason why the world does
not recognize us is that it has not known
him.
2 Dear friends, we are now God's
children; what we shall be has not yet
been disclosed, but we know that when
Christ appears we shall be like him,
because we shall see him as he is.
3 As he is pure, everyone who has
grasped this hope makes himself pure.
4 To commit sin is to break God's law:
for sin is lawlessness.
31 John 3.5–12
7
5 You know that Christ appeared in
order to take away sins, and in him there
is no sin.
6 No one who dwells in him sins any
more; the sinner has neither seen him
nor known him.
7 Children, do not be misled: anyone
who does what is right is righteous, just
as Christ is righteous;
8 anyone who sins is a child of the devil,
for the devil has been a sinner from the
first; and the Son of God appeared for
the very purpose of undoing the devil's
work.
9 No child of God commits sin, because
the divine seed remains in him; indeed
because he is God's child he cannot sin.
10 This is what shows who are God's
children and who are the devil's: anyone
who fails to do what is right or love his
fellow-Christians is not a child of God.
11 The message you have heard from
the beginning is that we should love one
another.
12 Do not be like Cain, who was a child
of the evil one and murdered his brother.
And why did he murder him? Because1 John 3.13–19
8
his own actions were wrong, and his
brother's were right.
13 Friends, do not be surprised if the
world hates you.
14 We know we have crossed over
from death to life, because we love our
fellow-Christians. Anyone who does not
love is still in the realm of death,
15 for everyone who hates a fellow-
Christian is a murderer, and murderers,
as you know, do not have eternal life
dwelling within them.
16 This is how we know what love is:
Christ gave his life for us. And we in
our turn must give our lives for our
fellow-Christians.
17 But if someone who possesses
the good things of this world sees a
fellow-Christian in need and withholds
compassion from him, how can it be said
that the love of God dwells in him?
18 Children, love must not be a matter
of theory or talk; it must be true love
which shows itself in action.
19 This is how we shall know that
we belong to the realm of truth, and
reassure ourselves in his sight1 John 3.20–4.3
9
20 where conscience condemns us; for
God is greater than our conscience and
knows all.
21 My dear friends, if our conscience
does not condemn us, then we can
approach God with confidence,
22 and obtain from him whatever
we ask, because we are keeping his
commands and doing what he approves.
23 His command is that we should give
our allegiance to his Son Jesus Christ and
love one another, as Christ commanded
us.
24 Those who keep his commands dwell
in him and he dwells in them. And our
certainty that he dwells in us comes from
the Spirit he has given us.
1 MY dear friends, do not trust every
spirit, but test the spirits, to see
whether they are from God; for there are
many false prophets about in the world.
2 The way to recognize the Spirit of God
is this: every spirit which acknowledges
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
from God,
3 and no spirit is from God which does
not acknowledge Jesus. This is the spirit
of antichrist; you have been warned that
41 John 4.4–10
10
it was to come, and now here it is, in the
world already!
4 Children, you belong to God's family,
and you have the mastery over these
false prophets, because God who inspires
you is greater than the one who inspires
the world.
5 They belong to that world, and so
does their teaching; that is why the
world listens to them.
6 But we belong to God and whoever
knows God listens to us, while whoever
does not belong to God refuses to listen
to us. That is how we can distinguish the
spirit of truth from the spirit of error.
7 MY dear friends, let us love one
another, because the source of love is
God. Everyone who loves is a child of
God and knows God,
8 but the unloving know nothing of God,
for God is love.
9 This is how he showed his love among
us: he sent his only Son into the world
that we might have life through him.
10 This is what love really is: not that
we have loved God, but that he loved us
and sent his Son as a sacrifice to atone
for our sins.1 John 4.11–18
11
11 If God thus loved us, my dear friends,
we also must love one another.
12 God has never been seen by anyone,
but if we love one another, he himself
dwells in us; his love is brought to
perfection within us.
13 This is how we know that we dwell in
him and he dwells in us: he has imparted
his Spirit to us.
14 Moreover, we have seen for ourselves,
and we are witnesses, that the Father
has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the
world.
15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is
God's Son, God dwells in him and he in
God.
16 Thus we have come to know and
believe in the love which God has for
us. God is love; he who dwells in love is
dwelling in God, and God in him.
17 This is how love has reached its
perfection among us, so that we
may have confidence on the day of
judgement; and this we can have,
because in this world we are as he is.
18 In love there is no room for fear;
indeed perfect love banishes fear. For
fear has to do with punishment, and1 John 4.19–5.5
12
anyone who is afraid has not attained to
love in its perfection.
19 We love because he loved us first.
20 But if someone says, I love God,
while at the same time hating his
fellow-Christian, he is a liar. If he does
not love a fellow-Christian whom he
has seen, he is incapable of loving God
whom he has not seen.
21 We have this command from Christ:
whoever loves God must love his
fellow-Christian too.
1 EVERYONE who believes that Jesus
is the Christ is a child of God. To love
the parent means to love his child.
2 It follows that when we love God and
obey his commands we love his children
too.
3 For to love God is to keep his
commands; and these are not
burdensome,
4 because every child of God overcomes
the world. Now, the victory by which the
world is overcome is our faith,
5 for who is victor over the world but
he who believes that Jesus is the Son of
God?
51 John 5.6–13
13
6 This is he whose coming was with
water and blood: Jesus Christ. He came,
not by the water alone, but both by the
water and by the blood; and to this the
Spirit bears witness, because the Spirit
is truth.
7 In fact there are three witnesses, the
Spirit, the water, and the blood, and
these three are in agreement.
8 (5:7)
9 We accept human testimony, but
surely the testimony of God is stronger,
and the testimony of God is the witness
he has borne to his Son.
10 He who believes in the Son of God
has the testimony in his own heart, but
he who does not believe God makes him
out to be a liar by refusing to accept
God's witness to his Son.
11 This is the witness: God has given us
eternal life, and this life is found in his
Son.
12 He who possesses the Son possesses
life; he who does not possess the Son of
God does not possess life.
13 YOU HAVE given your allegiance to
the Son of God; this letter is to assure
you that you have eternal life.1 John 5.14–20
14
14 We can approach God with this
confidence: if we make requests which
accord with his will, he listens to us;
15 and if we know that our requests are
heard, we also know that all we ask of
him is ours.
16 If anyone sees a fellow-Christian
committing a sin which is not a deadly
sin, he should intercede for him, and
God will grant him life -- that is, to those
who are not guilty of deadly sin. There is
such a thing as deadly sin, and I do not
suggest that he should pray about that.
17 Although all wrongdoing is sin, not all
sin is deadly sin.
18 We know that no child of God
commits sin; he is kept safe by the Son
of God, and the evil one cannot touch
him.
19 We know that we are of God's family,
but that the whole world lies in the
power of the evil one.
20 We know that the Son of God has
come and given us understanding to
know the true God; indeed we are in
him who is true, since we are in his Son
Jesus Christ. He is the true God and
eternal life.1 John 5.21
15
21 Children, be on your guard against
idols.2 John
1 THE Elder to the Lady chosen by
1 God and to her children whom I love
in the truth, and not I alone but all who
know the truth.
2 We love you for the sake of the truth
that dwells among us and will be with us
for ever.
3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with
us from God the Father and from Jesus
Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and
love.
4 I was very glad to find that some of
your children are living by the truth, in
accordance with the command we have
received from the Father.
5 And now, Lady, I have a request to
make of you. Do not think I am sending
a new command; I am recalling the one
we have had from the beginning: I ask
that we love one another.
6 What love means is to live according
to the commands of God. This is the
command that was given you from the
beginning, to be your rule of life.2 John 1.7–13
2
7 Many deceivers have gone out into the
world, people who do not acknowledge
Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh.
Any such person is the deceiver and
antichrist.
8 See to it that you do not lose what we
have worked for, but receive your reward
in full.
9 Anyone who does not stand by the
teaching about Christ, but goes beyond
it, does not possess God; he who stands
by it possesses both the Father and the
Son.
10 If anyone comes to you who does not
bring this teaching, do not admit him to
your house or give him any greeting;
11 for he who greets him becomes an
accomplice in his evil deeds.
12 I have much to write to you, but I do
not care to put it down on paper. Rather,
I hope to visit you and talk with you face
to face, so that our joy may be complete.
13 The children of your Sister, chosen by
God, send you greetings.3 John
1 THE Elder to dear Gaius, whom I
1 love in the truth.
2 Dear friend, above all I pray that
things go well with you, and that you
may enjoy good health: I know it is well
with your soul.
3 I was very glad when some fellow-
Christians arrived and told me of your
faithfulness to the truth; indeed you live
by the truth.
4 Nothing gives me greater joy than to
hear that my children are living by the
truth.
5 Dear friend, you show a fine loyalty
in what you do for our fellow-Christians,
though they are strangers to you.
6 They have testified to your kindness
before the congregation here. Please
help them on their journey in a manner
worthy of the God we serve.
7 It was for love of Christ's name that
they went out; and they would accept
nothing from unbelievers.3 John 1.8–14
2
8 Therefore we ought to support such
people, and so play our part in spreading
the truth.
9 I wrote to the congregation, but
Diotrephes, who enjoys taking the lead,
will have nothing to do with us.
10 So when I come, I will draw attention
to the things he is doing: he lays
nonsensical and spiteful charges against
us; not content with that, he refuses to
receive fellow-Christians himself, and
interferes with those who would receive
them, and tries to expel them from the
congregation.
11 Dear friend, follow good examples,
not bad ones. The well-doer is a child of
God; the evildoer has never seen God.
12 Demetrius is well spoken of by
everyone, and even by the truth itself. I
add my testimony, and you know that
my testimony is true.
13 I had much to write to you, but I do
not care to set it down with pen and ink.
14 I hope to see you very soon, when we
will talk face to face. Peace be with you.
Your friends here send you greetings.
Greet each of our friends by name.Jude
1 FROM Jude, servant of Jesus Christ
1 and brother of James, to those whom
God has called, who live in the love of
God the Father and are kept safe for the
coming of Jesus Christ.
2 Mercy, peace, and love be yours in
fullest measure.
3 My friends, I was fully intending to
write to you about the salvation we
share, when I found it necessary to
take up my pen and urge you to join
in the struggle for that faith which God
entrusted to his people once for all.
4 Certain individuals have wormed
their way in, the very people whom
scripture long ago marked down for
the sentence they are now incurring.
They are enemies of religion; they
pervert the free favour of our God into
licentiousness, disowning Jesus Christ,
our only Master and Lord.
5 You already know all this, but let
me remind you how the Lord, having
once for all delivered his people out ofJude 1.6–10
2
Egypt, later destroyed those who did not
believe.
6 Remember too those angels who were
not content to maintain the dominion
assigned to them, but abandoned their
proper dwelling-place; God is holding
them, bound in darkness with everlasting
chains, for judgement on the great day.
7 Remember Sodom and Gomorrah and
the neighbouring towns; like the angels,
they committed fornication and indulged
in unnatural lusts; and in eternal fire
they paid the penalty, a warning for all.
8 In the same way these deluded
dreamers continue to defile their bodies,
flout authority, and insult celestial
beings.
9 Not even the archangel Michael, when
he was disputing with the devil for
possession of Moses' body, presumed
to condemn him in insulting words, but
said, May the Lord rebuke you!
10 But these people pour abuse on
whatever they do not understand; the
things that, like brute beasts, they do
understand by their senses prove their
undoing.Jude 1.11–16
3
11 Alas for them! They have followed the
way of Cain; for profit they have plunged
into Balaam's error; they have rebelled
like Korah, and they share his fate.
12 These people are a danger at
your love-feasts with their shameless
carousals. They are shepherds who take
care only of themselves. They are clouds
carried along by a wind without giving
rain, trees fruitless in autumn, dead
twice over and pulled up by the roots.
13 They are wild sea waves, foaming
with disgraceful deeds; they are stars
that have wandered from their courses,
and the place reserved for them is an
eternity of blackest darkness.
14 It was against them that Enoch,
the seventh in descent from Adam,
prophesied when he said: I saw the Lord
come with his myriads of angels,
15 to bring all mankind to judgement
and to convict all the godless of every
godless deed they had committed, and
of every defiant word they had spoken
against him, godless sinners that they
are.
16 They are a set of grumblers and
malcontents. They follow their lusts.Jude 1.17–24
4
Bombast comes rolling from their lips,
and they court favour to gain their ends.
17 But you, my friends, should
remember the predictions made by the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
18 They said to you: In the final age
there will be those who mock at religion
and follow their own ungodly lusts.
19 These people create divisions; they
are worldly and unspiritual.
20 But you, my friends, must make your
most sacred faith the foundation of your
lives. Continue to pray in the power of
the Holy Spirit.
21 Keep yourselves in the love of God,
and look forward to the day when our
Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy will give
eternal life.
22 There are some doubting souls who
need your pity.
23 Others you should save by snatching
them from the flames. For others your
pity must be mixed with fear; hate the
very clothing that is contaminated with
sensuality.
24 Now to the One who can keep you
from falling and set you in the presence
of his glory, jubilant and above reproach,Jude 1.25
5
25 to the only God our Saviour, be
glory and majesty, power and authority,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all
time, now, and for evermore. Amen.Revelation
1 THIS is the revelation of Jesus
1 Christ, which God gave him so that
he might show his servants what must
soon take place. He made it known by
sending his angel to his servant John,
2 who in telling all that he saw has
borne witness to the word of God and to
the testimony of Jesus Christ.
3 Happy is the one who reads aloud the
words of this prophecy, and happy those
who listen if they take to heart what is
here written; for the time of fulfilment is
near.
4 JOHN, to the seven churches in the
province of Asia. Grace be to you and
peace, from him who is, who was, and
who is to come, from the seven spirits
before his throne,
5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful
witness, the firstborn from the dead and
ruler of the kings of the earth. To him
who loves us and has set us free from
our sins with his blood,Revelation 1.6–11
2
6 who has made of us a royal house
to serve as the priests of his God and
Father -- to him be glory and dominion
for ever! Amen.
7 Look, he is coming with the clouds;
everyone shall see him, including those
who pierced him; and all the peoples of
the world shall lament in remorse. So it
shall be. Amen.
8 I am the Alpha and the Omega, says
the Lord God, who is, who was, and who
is to come, the sovereign Lord of all.
9 I, John, your brother, who share with
you in the suffering, the sovereignty, and
the endurance which are ours in Jesus,
was on the island called Patmos because
I had preached God's word and borne
my testimony to Jesus.
10 On the Lord's day the Spirit came
upon me; and I heard behind me a loud
voice, like the sound of a trumpet,
11 which said, Write down in a
book what you see and send it to
the seven churches: to Ephesus,
Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis,
Philadelphia, and Laodicea.Revelation 1.12– 20
3
12 I turned to see whose voice it was
that spoke to me; and when I turned I
saw seven lampstands of gold.
13 Among the lamps was a figure like
a man, in a robe that came to his feet,
with a golden girdle round his breast.
14 His hair was as white as snow-white
wool, and his eyes flamed like fire;
15 his feet were like burnished bronze
refined in a furnace, and his voice was
like the sound of a mighty torrent.
16 In his right hand he held seven
stars, and from his mouth came a sharp,
two-edged sword; his face shone like the
sun in full strength.
17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as
though I were dead. But he laid his right
hand on me and said, Do not be afraid. I
am the first and the last,
18 and I am the living One; I was dead
and now I am alive for evermore, and I
hold the keys of death and Hades.
19 Write down therefore what you have
seen, what is now, and what is to take
place hereafter.
20 This is the secret meaning of the
seven stars you saw in my right hand,
and of the seven gold lamps: theRevelation 2.1– 7
4
seven stars are the angels of the seven
churches, and the seven lamps are the
seven churches themselves.
1 TO THE angel of the church at
Ephesus write: These are the words
of the One who holds the seven stars
in his right hand, who walks among the
seven gold lamps:
2 I know what you are doing, how you
toil and endure. I know you cannot abide
wicked people; you have put to the test
those who claim to be apostles but are
not, and you have found them to be
false.
3 Endurance you have; you have borne
up in my cause and have never become
weary.
4 However, I have this against you: the
love you felt at first you have now lost.
5 Think from what a height you have
fallen; repent, and do as once you did.
If you do not, I will come to you and
remove your lamp from its place.
6 Yet you have this much in your favour:
you detest as I do the practices of the
Nicolaitans.
7 You have ears, so hear what the Spirit
says to the churches! To those who are
2Revelation 2.8–13
5
victorious I will give the right to eat from
the tree of life that stands in the garden
of God.
8 To the angel of the church at Smyrna
write: These are the words of the First
and the Last, who was dead and came to
life again:
9 I know how hard pressed and poor
you are, but in reality you are rich. I
know how you are slandered by those
who claim to be Jews but are not; they
are really a synagogue of Satan.
10 Do not be afraid of the sufferings to
come. The devil will throw some of you
into prison, to be put to the test, and for
ten days you will be hard pressed. Be
faithful till death, and I will give you the
crown of life.
11 You have ears, so hear what the
Spirit says to the churches! Those who
are victorious cannot be harmed by the
second death.
12 To the angel of the church at
Pergamum write: These are the words of
the One who has the sharp, two-edged
sword:
13 I know where you live; it is where
Satan is enthroned. Yet you are holdingRevelation 2.14– 18
6
fast to my cause, and did not deny
your faith in me even at the time when
Antipas, my faithful witness, was put to
death in your city, where Satan has his
home.
14 But I have a few matters to bring
against you. You have in Pergamum some
that hold to the teaching of Balaam, who
taught Balak to put temptation in the
way of the Israelites; he encouraged
them to eat food sacrificed to idols and
to commit fornication.
15 In the same way you also have
some who hold to the teaching of the
Nicolaitans.
16 So repent! If you do not, I will come
to you quickly and make war on them
with the sword that comes out of my
mouth.
17 You have ears, so hear what the
Spirit says to the churches! To anyone
who is victorious I will give some of the
hidden manna; I will also give him a
white stone, and on it will be written
a new name, known only to him who
receives it.
18 To the angel of the church at Thyatira
write: These are the words of the SonRevelation 2.19– 24
7
of God, whose eyes flame like fire, and
whose feet are like burnished bronze:
19 I know what you are doing, your love
and faithfulness, your service and your
endurance; indeed of late you have done
even better than you did at first.
20 But I have this against you: you
tolerate that Jezebel, the woman who
claims to be a prophetess, whose
teaching lures my servants into
fornication and into eating food sacrificed
to idols.
21 I have given her time to repent, but
she refuses to repent of her fornication.
22 So I will throw her on a bed of pain,
and I will plunge her lovers into terrible
suffering, unless they renounce what she
is doing;
23 and her children I will kill with
pestilence. This will teach all the
churches that I am the searcher of men's
hearts and minds, and that I will give to
each of you what his deeds deserve.
24 And now I speak to the rest of you
in Thyatira, all who do not accept this
teaching and have had no experience of
what they call the deep secrets of Satan.
On you I impose no further burden;Revelation 2.25–3.3
8
25 only hold fast to what you have, until
I come.
26 To him who is victorious, to him who
perseveres in doing my will to the end, I
will give authority over the nations --
27 that same authority which I received
from my Father -- and he will rule them
with a rod of iron, smashing them to
pieces like earthenware;
28 and I will give him the star of dawn.
29 You have ears, so hear what the
Spirit says to the churches!
1 To the angel of the church at Sardis
write: These are the words of the
One who has the seven spirits of God
and the seven stars: I know what you
are doing; people say you are alive, but
in fact you are dead.
2 Wake up, and put some strength into
what you still have, because otherwise it
must die! For I have not found any work
of yours brought to completion in the
sight of my God.
3 Remember therefore the teaching you
received; observe it, and repent. If you
do not wake up, I will come upon you
like a thief, and you will not know the
moment of my coming.
3Revelation 3.4– 9
9
4 Yet you have a few people in Sardis
who have not polluted their clothing, and
they will walk with me in white, for so
they deserve.
5 Anyone who is victorious will be robed
in white like them, and I shall never
strike his name off the roll of the living;
in the presence of my Father and his
angels I shall acknowledge him as mine.
6 You have ears, so hear what the Spirit
says to the churches!
7 To the angel of the church at
Philadelphia write: These are the words
of the Holy One, the True One, who has
David's key, so that when he opens the
door, no one can shut it, and when he
shuts it, no one can open it:
8 I know what you are doing. I have set
before you an open door which no one
can shut. I know your strength is small,
yet you have observed my command
and have not disowned my name.
9 As for those of Satan's synagogue,
who falsely claim to be Jews, I will make
them come and fall at your feet; and
they will know that you are my beloved
people.Revelation 3.10– 16
10
10 Because you have kept my command
to stand firm, I will also keep you from
the ordeal that is to fall upon the whole
world to test its inhabitants.
11 I am coming soon; hold fast to what
you have, and let no one rob you of your
crown.
12 Those who are victorious I shall make
pillars in the temple of my God; they
will remain there for ever. I shall write
on them the name of my God, and the
name of the city of my God, that new
Jerusalem which is coming down out of
heaven from my God, and my own new
name.
13 You have ears, so hear what the
Spirit says to the churches!
14 To the angel of the church at Laodicea
write: These are the words of the Amen,
the faithful and true witness, the source
of God's creation:
15 I know what you are doing; you are
neither cold nor hot. How I wish you
were either cold or hot!
16 Because you are neither one nor the
other, but just lukewarm, I will spit you
out of my mouth.Revelation 3.17–4.1
11
17 You say, How rich I am! What a
fortune I have made! I have everything I
want. In fact, though you do not realize
it, you are a pitiful wretch, poor, blind,
and naked.
18 I advise you to buy from me gold
refined in the fire to make you truly rich,
and white robes to put on to hide the
shame of your nakedness, and ointment
for your eyes so that you may see.
19 All whom I love I reprove and
discipline. Be wholehearted therefore in
your repentance.
20 Here I stand knocking at the door; if
anyone hears my voice and opens the
door, I will come in and he and I will eat
together.
21 To anyone who is victorious I will
grant a place beside me on my throne,
as I myself was victorious and sat down
with my Father on his throne.
22 You have ears, so hear what the
Spirit says to the churches!
1 AFTER this I had a vision: a door
stood open in heaven, and the voice
that I had first heard speaking to me
like a trumpet said, Come up here, and
4Revelation 4.2– 8
12
I will show you what must take place
hereafter.
2 At once the Spirit came upon me.
There in heaven stood a throne. On it sat
One
3 whose appearance was like jasper or
cornelian, and round it was a rainbow,
bright as an emerald.
4 In a circle about this throne were
twenty-four other thrones, and on them
were seated twenty-four elders, robed in
white and wearing gold crowns.
5 From the throne came flashes of
lightning and peals of thunder. Burning
before the throne were seven flaming
torches, the seven spirits of God,
6 and in front of it stretched what looked
like a sea of glass or a sheet of ice. In
the centre, round the throne itself, were
four living creatures, covered with eyes
in front and behind.
7 The first creature was like a lion, the
second like an ox, the third had a human
face, and the fourth was like an eagle in
flight.
8 Each of the four living creatures
had six wings, and eyes all round and
inside them. Day and night unceasinglyRevelation 4.9–5.3
13
they sing: Holy, holy, holy is God the
sovereign Lord of all, who was, and is,
and is to come!
9 Whenever the living creatures give
glory and honour and thanks to the One
who sits on the throne, who lives for
ever and ever,
10 the twenty-four elders prostrate
themselves before the One who sits on
the throne and they worship him who
lives for ever and ever. As they lay their
crowns before the throne they cry:
11 You are worthy, O Lord our God, to
receive glory and honour and power,
because you created all things; by your
will they were created and have their
being!
1 I saw in the right hand of the One
who sat on the throne a scroll with
writing on both sides, and sealed with
seven seals.
2 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming
in a loud voice, Who is worthy to break
the seals and open the scroll?
3 But there was no one in heaven or on
earth or under the earth able to open
the scroll to look inside it.
5Revelation 5.4– 9
14
4 And because no one was found worthy
to open the scroll and look inside, I wept
bitterly.
5 One of the elders said to me: Do not
weep; the Lion from the tribe of Judah,
the shoot growing from David's stock,
has won the right to open the scroll and
its seven seals.
6 Then I saw a Lamb with the marks
of sacrifice on him, standing with the
four living creatures between the throne
and the elders. He had seven horns
and seven eyes, the eyes which are the
seven spirits of God sent to every part of
the world.
7 The Lamb came and received the
scroll from the right hand of the One
who sat on the throne.
8 As he did so, the four living creatures
and the twenty-four elders prostrated
themselves before the Lamb. Each of
the elders had a harp; they held golden
bowls full of incense, the prayers of
God's people,
9 and they were singing a new song:
You are worthy to receive the scroll and
break its seals, for you were slain and by
your blood you bought for God peopleRevelation 5.10–6.2
15
of every tribe and language, nation and
race.
10 You have made them a royal house of
priests for our God, and they shall reign
on earth.
11 As I looked I heard, all round the
throne and the living creatures and
the elders, the voices of many angels,
thousands on thousands, myriads on
myriads.
12 They proclaimed with loud voices:
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to
receive power and wealth, wisdom and
might, honour and glory and praise!
13 Then I heard all created things, in
heaven, on earth, under the earth, and
in the sea, crying: Praise and honour,
glory and might, to him who sits on the
throne and to the Lamb for ever!
14 The four living creatures said, Amen,
and the elders prostrated themselves in
worship.
1 I WATCHED as the Lamb broke the
first of the seven seals, and I heard
one of the four living creatures say in a
voice like thunder, Come!
2 There before my eyes was a white
horse, and its rider held a bow. He
6Revelation 6.3– 8
16
was given a crown, and he rode forth,
conquering and to conquer.
3 The Lamb broke the second seal, and
I heard the second creature say, Come!
4 Out came another horse, which was
red. Its rider was given power to take
away peace from the earth that men
might slaughter one another; and he
was given a great sword.
5 He broke the third seal, and I heard
the third creature say, Come! There, as I
looked, was a black horse, and its rider
was holding in his hand a pair of scales.
6 I heard what sounded like a voice from
among the four living creatures; it said,
A day's wage for a quart of flour, a day's
wage for three quarts of barley-meal!
But do not damage the olive and the
vine!
7 He broke the fourth seal, and I heard
the fourth creature say, Come!
8 There, as I looked, was another horse,
sickly pale; its rider's name was Death,
and Hades followed close behind. To
them was given power over a quarter
of the earth, power to kill by sword and
famine, by pestilence and wild beasts.Revelation 6.9–15
17
9 He broke the fifth seal, and I saw
beneath the altar the souls of those who
had been slaughtered for God's word
and for the testimony they bore.
10 They gave a great cry: How long,
sovereign Lord, holy and true, must
it be before you will vindicate us and
avenge our death on the inhabitants of
the earth?
11 They were each given a white robe,
and told to rest a little longer, until the
number should be complete of all their
brothers in Christ's service who were to
be put to death, as they themselves had
been.
12 I watched as the Lamb broke the sixth
seal. There was a violent earthquake;
the sun turned black as a funeral pall
and the moon all red as blood;
13 the stars in the sky fell to the earth,
like figs blown off a tree in a gale;
14 the sky vanished like a scroll being
rolled up, and every mountain and island
was dislodged from its place.
15 The kings of the earth, the nobles
and the commanders, the rich and the
powerful, and all men, slave or free, hidRevelation 6.16–7.5
18
themselves in caves and under mountain
crags;
16 and they called out to the mountains
and the crags, Fall on us, hide us from
the One who sits on the throne and from
the wrath of the Lamb,
17 for the great day of their wrath has
come, and who can stand?
1 After that I saw four angels
stationed at the four corners of the
earth, holding back its four winds so that
no wind should blow on land or sea or on
any tree.
2 I saw another angel rising from the
east, bearing the seal of the living God.
To the four angels who had been given
the power to ravage land and sea, he
cried out:
3 Do no damage to land or sea or to the
trees until we have set the seal of our
God upon the foreheads of his servants.
4 I heard how many had been marked
with the seal -- a hundred and forty-four
thousand from all the tribes of Israel:
5 twelve thousand from the tribe of
Judah, twelve thousand from the tribe of
Reuben, twelve thousand from the tribe
of Gad,
7Revelation 7.6–12
19
6 twelve thousand from the tribe of
Asher, twelve thousand from the tribe of
Naphtali, twelve thousand from the tribe
of Manasseh,
7 twelve thousand from the tribe of
Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe
of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe
of Issachar,
8 twelve thousand from the tribe of
Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe
of Joseph, and twelve thousand from the
tribe of Benjamin.
9 After that I looked and saw a vast
throng, which no one could count,
from all races and tribes, nations and
languages, standing before the throne
and the Lamb. They were robed in white
and had palm branches in their hands,
10 and they shouted aloud: Victory to
our God who sits on the throne, and to
the Lamb!
11 All the angels who stood round the
throne and round the elders and the four
living creatures prostrated themselves
before the throne and worshipped God,
12 crying: Amen! Praise and glory and
wisdom, thanksgiving and honour, power
and might, be to our God for ever! Amen.Revelation 7.13–8.2
20
13 One of the elders turned to me and
asked, Who are these all robed in white,
and where do they come from?
14 I answered, My lord, it is you who
know. He said to me, They are those who
have passed through the great ordeal;
they have washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb.
15 That is why they stand before the
throne of God and worship him day and
night in his temple; and he who sits on
the throne will protect them with his
presence.
16 Never again shall they feel hunger or
thirst; never again shall the sun beat on
them or any scorching heat,
17 because the Lamb who is at the
centre of the throne will be their
shepherd and will guide them to springs
of the water of life; and God will wipe
every tear from their eyes.
1 Now when the Lamb broke the
seventh seal, there was silence in
heaven for about half an hour.
2 I SAW the seven angels who stand in
the presence of God: they were given
seven trumpets.
8Revelation 8.3– 9
21
3 Another angel came and stood at the
altar, holding a golden censer. He was
given much incense to offer with the
prayers of all God's people on the golden
altar in front of the throne,
4 and the smoke of the incense from the
angel's hand went up before God with
his people's prayers.
5 The angel took the censer, filled it with
fire from the altar, and threw it down
on the earth; and there came peals
of thunder, lightning-flashes, and an
earthquake.
6 THE seven angels who held the seven
trumpets prepared to blow them.
7 The first angel blew his trumpet. There
came hail and fire mingled with blood,
and this was hurled upon the earth; a
third of the earth was burnt, a third of
the trees, and all the green grass.
8 The second angel blew his trumpet.
What looked like a great mountain
flaming with fire was hurled into the sea;
a third of the sea was turned to blood,
9 a third of the living creatures in it
died, and a third of the ships on it were
destroyed.Revelation 8.10–9.2
22
10 The third angel blew his trumpet. A
great star shot from the sky, flaming like
a torch, and fell on a third of the rivers
and springs;
11 the name of the star was Wormwood.
A third of the water turned to wormwood,
and great numbers of people died from
drinking the water because it had been
made bitter.
12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A
third part of the sun was struck, a third
of the moon, and a third of the stars, so
that a third part of them turned dark and
a third of the light failed to appear by
day or by night.
13 As I looked, I heard an eagle calling
with a loud cry as it flew in mid-heaven:
Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the
earth at the sound of the other trumpets
which the next three angels must now
blow!
1 The fifth angel blew his trumpet.
I saw a star that had fallen from
heaven to earth, and the star was given
the key to the shaft of the abyss.
2 He opened it, and smoke came up
from it like smoke from a great furnace
and darkened the sun and the air.
9Revelation 9.3–10
23
3 Out of the smoke came locusts over
the earth, and they were given the
powers of scorpions.
4 They were told not to do damage to
the grass or to any plant or tree, but only
to those people who had not received
God's seal on their foreheads.
5 They were given permission to
torment them for five months with
torment like a scorpion's sting; but they
were not to kill them.
6 During that time people will seek
death, but will not find it; they will long
to die, but death will elude them.
7 In appearance the locusts were like
horses equipped for battle. On their
heads were what looked like gold
crowns; their faces were like human
faces
8 and their hair like women's hair; they
had teeth like lions' teeth
9 and chests like iron breastplates; the
sound of their wings was like the noise
of many horses and chariots charging
into battle;
10 they had tails like scorpions, with
stings in them, and in their tails lay their
power to injure people for five months.Revelation 9.11– 17
24
11 They had for their king the angel of
the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is
Abaddon, and in Greek Apollyon, the
Destroyer.
12 The first woe has now passed; but
there are still two more to come.
13 The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I
heard a voice coming from the horns
of the golden altar that stood in the
presence of God.
14 To the sixth angel, who held the
trumpet, the voice said: Release the four
angels held bound at the Great River, the
Euphrates!
15 So the four angels were let loose, to
kill a third of mankind; they had been
held in readiness for this very year,
month, day, and hour.
16 And their squadrons of cavalry
numbered twice ten thousand times ten
thousand; this was the number I heard.
17 This was how I saw the horses and
their riders in my vision: they wore
breastplates, fiery red, turquoise, and
sulphur-yellow; the horses had heads
like lions' heads, and from their mouths
issued fire, smoke, and sulphur.Revelation 9.18–10.2
25
18 By these three plagues, the fire, the
smoke, and the sulphur that came from
their mouths, a third of mankind was
killed.
19 The power of the horses lay in their
mouths and in their tails; for their tails
had heads like serpents, and with them
they inflicted injuries.
20 The rest of mankind who survived
these plagues still did not renounce the
gods their hands had made, or cease
their worship of demons and of idols
fashioned from gold, silver, bronze,
stone, and wood, which cannot see or
hear or walk;
21 nor did they repent of their murders,
their sorcery, their fornication, or their
robberies.
1 I SAW another mighty angel
coming down from heaven. He
was wrapped in cloud, with a rainbow
over his head; his face shone like the
sun and his legs were like pillars of fire.
2 In his hand he held a little scroll which
had been opened. He planted his right
foot on the sea and his left on the land,
10Revelation 10.3–9
26
3 and gave a great shout like the roar
of a lion; when he shouted, the seven
thunders spoke.
4 I was about to write down what the
seven thunders had said, but I heard
a voice from heaven saying, Put under
seal what the seven thunders have said;
do not write it down.
5 Then the angel whom I saw standing
on the sea and the land raised his right
hand towards heaven
6 and swore by him who lives for ever,
who created heaven and earth and the
sea and everything in them: There shall
be no more delay;
7 when the time comes for the seventh
angel to sound his trumpet, the hidden
purpose of God will have been fulfilled,
as he promised to his servants the
prophets.
8 The voice which I had heard from
heaven began speaking to me again; it
said, Go and take the scroll which is open
in the hand of the angel who stands on
the sea and the land.
9 I went to the angel and asked him to
give me the little scroll. He answered,
Take it, and eat it. It will turn yourRevelation 10.10–11.5
27
stomach sour, but in your mouth it will
taste as sweet as honey.
10 I took the scroll from the angel's
hand and ate it, and in my mouth it did
taste as sweet as honey, but when I
swallowed it my stomach turned sour.
11 Then I was told, Once again you must
utter prophecies over many nations,
races, languages, and kings.
1 I was given a long cane to use
as a measuring rod, and was told:
Go and measure the temple of God and
the altar, and count the worshippers.
2 But leave the outer court of the
temple out of your measurements; it has
been given over to the Gentiles, and for
forty-two months they will trample the
Holy City underfoot.
3 I will give my two witnesses authority
to prophesy, dressed in sackcloth, for
those twelve hundred and sixty days.
4 They are the two olive trees and the
two lamps that stand in the presence of
the Lord of the earth.
5 If anyone tries to injure them, fire
issues from their mouths and consumes
their enemies; so shall anyone die who
tries to do them injury.
11Revelation 11.6– 11
28
6 These two have the power to shut up
the sky, so that no rain falls during the
time of their prophesying; and they have
power to turn water into blood and to
afflict the earth with every kind of plague
whenever they like.
7 But when they have completed their
testimony, the beast that comes up from
the abyss will wage war on them and will
overcome and kill them.
8 Their bodies will lie in the street of
the great city, whose name in prophetic
language is Sodom, or Egypt, where also
their Lord was crucified.
9 For three and a half days people from
every nation and tribe, language, and
race, gaze on their corpses and refuse
them burial.
10 The earth's inhabitants gloat over
them; they celebrate and exchange
presents, for these two prophets were a
torment to them.
11 But at the end of the three and a
half days the breath of life from God
came into their bodies, and they rose to
their feet, to the terror of those who saw
them.Revelation 11.12–18
29
12 A loud voice from heaven was heard
saying to them, Come up here! and they
ascended to heaven in a cloud, in full
view of their enemies.
13 At that moment there was a violent
earthquake, and a tenth of the city
collapsed. Seven thousand people were
killed in the earthquake; the rest, filled
with fear, did homage to the God of
heaven.
14 The second woe has now passed; but
the third is soon to come.
15 Then the seventh angel blew his
trumpet. Voices in heaven were heard
crying aloud: Sovereignty over the world
has passed to our Lord and his Christ,
and he shall reign for ever!
16 The twenty-four elders, who sit on
their thrones before God, prostrated
themselves before him in adoration,
17 saying: O Lord God, sovereign over
all, you are and you were; we give you
thanks because you have assumed full
power and entered upon your reign.
18 The nations rose in wrath, but your
day of wrath has come. Now is the
time for the dead to be judged; now
is the time for rewards to be given toRevelation 11.19–12.4
30
your servants the prophets, to your
own people, and to all who honour your
name, both small and great; now is the
time to destroy those who destroy the
earth.
19 God's sanctuary in heaven was
opened, and within his sanctuary was
seen the ark of his covenant. There came
flashes of lightning and peals of thunder,
an earthquake, and a violent hailstorm.
1 AFTER that there appeared a
great sign in heaven: a woman
robed with the sun, beneath her feet
the moon, and on her head a crown of
twelve stars.
2 She was about to bear a child, and in
the anguish of her labour she cried out
to be delivered.
3 Then a second sign appeared in
heaven: a great, fiery red dragon with
seven heads and ten horns. On his heads
were seven diadems,
4 and with his tail he swept down a third
of the stars in the sky and hurled them
to the earth. The dragon stood in front
of the woman who was about to give
birth, so that when her child was born he
might devour it.
12Revelation 12.5– 11
31
5 But when she gave birth to a male
child, who is destined to rule all nations
with a rod of iron, the child was snatched
up to God and to his throne.
6 The woman herself fled into the
wilderness, where she was to be looked
after for twelve hundred and sixty days
in a place prepared for her by God.
7 Then war broke out in heaven; Michael
and his angels fought against the dragon.
The dragon with his angels fought back,
8 but he was too weak, and they lost
their place in heaven.
9 The great dragon was thrown down,
that ancient serpent who led the whole
world astray, whose name is the Devil,
or Satan; he was thrown down to the
earth, and his angels with him.
10 I heard a loud voice in heaven
proclaim: This is the time of victory
for our God, the time of his power and
sovereignty, when his Christ comes to
his rightful rule! For the accuser of our
brothers, he who day and night accused
them before our God, is overthrown.
11 By the sacrifice of the Lamb and
by the witness they bore, they haveRevelation 12.12–17
32
conquered him; faced with death they
did not cling to life.
12 Therefore rejoice, you heavens and
you that dwell in them! But woe to you,
earth and sea, for the Devil has come
down to you in great fury, knowing that
his time is short!
13 When the dragon saw that he had
been thrown down to the earth, he went
in pursuit of the woman who had given
birth to the male child.
14 But she was given the wings of a
mighty eagle, so that she could fly to her
place in the wilderness where she was
to be looked after for three and a half
years, out of reach of the serpent.
15 From his mouth the serpent spewed a
flood of water after the woman to sweep
her away with its spate.
16 But the earth came to her rescue:
it opened its mouth and drank up the
river which the dragon spewed from his
mouth.
17 Furious with the woman, the dragon
went off to wage war on the rest of
her offspring, those who keep God's
commandments and maintain their
witness to Jesus.Revelation 13.1–6
33
1 He took his stand on the
13 seashore. Then I saw a beast
rising out of the sea. It had ten horns
and seven heads; on the horns were
ten diadems, and on each head was a
blasphemous name.
2 The beast I saw resembled a leopard,
but its feet were like a bear's and its
mouth like a lion's. The dragon conferred
on it his own power, his throne, and
great authority.
3 One of the heads seemed to have been
given a death blow, yet its mortal wound
was healed. The whole world went after
the beast in wondering admiration,
4 and worshipped the dragon because
he had conferred his authority on the
beast; they worshipped the beast also.
Who is like the beast? they said. Who
can fight against it?
5 The beast was allowed to mouth
bombast and blasphemy, and was
granted permission to continue for
forty-two months.
6 It uttered blasphemies against God,
reviling his name and his dwelling-place,
that is, those who dwell in heaven.Revelation 13.7– 14
34
7 It was also allowed to wage war on
God's people and to defeat them, and it
was granted authority over every tribe,
nation, language, and race.
8 All the inhabitants of the earth will
worship it, all whose names have not
been written in the book of life of the
Lamb, slain since the foundation of the
world.
9 You have ears, so hear!
10 Whoever is to be made prisoner, to
prison he shall go; whoever is to be slain
by the sword, by the sword he must be
slain. This calls for the endurance and
faithfulness of God's people.
11 Then I saw another beast; it came up
out of the earth, and had two horns like
a lamb's, but spoke like a dragon.
12 It wielded all the authority of the
first beast in its presence, and made the
earth and its inhabitants worship this
first beast, whose mortal wound had
been healed.
13 It worked great miracles, even
making fire come down from heaven to
earth, where people could see it.
14 By the miracles it was allowed to
perform in the presence of the beast itRevelation 13.15–14.2
35
deluded the inhabitants of the earth,
and persuaded them to erect an image
in honour of the beast which had been
wounded by the sword and yet lived.
15 It was allowed to give breath to the
image of the beast, so that it could
even speak and cause all who would not
worship the image to be put to death.
16 It caused everyone, small and great,
rich and poor, free man and slave, to
have a mark put on his right hand or his
forehead,
17 and no one was allowed to buy or sell
unless he bore this beast's mark, either
name or number.
18 (This calls for skill; let anyone who
has intelligence work out the number of
the beast, for the number represents a
man's name, and the numerical value of
its letters is six hundred and sixty-six.)
1 I LOOKED, and there on Mount
Zion stood the Lamb, and with
him were a hundred and forty-four
thousand who had his name and the
name of his Father written on their
foreheads.
2 I heard a sound from heaven like
a mighty torrent or a great peal of
14Revelation 14.3–8
36
thunder; what I heard was like harpists
playing on their harps.
3 They were singing a new song before
the throne and the four living creatures
and the elders, and no one could learn
it except the hundred and forty-four
thousand ransomed from the earth.
4 These are men who have kept
themselves chaste and have not defiled
themselves with women; these follow
the Lamb wherever he goes. They have
been ransomed as the firstfruits of
mankind for God and the Lamb.
5 No lie was found on their lips; they are
without fault.
6 Then I saw an angel flying in
mid-heaven, with an eternal gospel to
proclaim to those on earth, to every
race, tribe, language, and nation.
7 He spoke in a loud voice: Fear God
and pay him homage, for the hour of his
judgement has come! Worship him who
made heaven and earth, the sea and the
springs of water!
8 A second angel followed, saying,
Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who
has made all nations drink the wine of
God's anger roused by her fornication!Revelation 14.9– 14
37
9 A third angel followed, saying in a loud
voice, Whoever worships the beast and
its image and receives its mark on his
forehead or hand,
10 he too shall drink the wine of God's
anger, poured undiluted into the cup
of his wrath. He shall be tormented in
sulphurous flames in the sight of the
holy angels and the Lamb.
11 The smoke of their torment will
rise for ever; there will be no respite
day or night for those who worship the
beast and its image, or for anyone who
receives the mark of its name.
12 This calls for the endurance of
God's people, all those who keep his
commands and remain loyal to Jesus.
13 I heard a voice from heaven say,
Write this: Happy are the dead who
henceforth die in the faith of the Lord!
Yes, says the Spirit, let them rest from
their labours, for the record of their
deeds goes with them.
14 As I looked there appeared a white
cloud, on which was seated a figure like
a man; he had a gold crown on his head
and a sharp sickle in his hand.Revelation 14.15–15.1
38
15 Another angel came out of the temple
and called in a loud voice to him who sat
on the cloud: Put in your sickle and reap,
for harvest time has come and earth's
crop is fully ripe.
16 So the one who sat on the cloud
swept over the earth with his sickle and
the harvest was reaped.
17 Another angel came out of the
heavenly sanctuary, and he also had a
sharp sickle.
18 Then from the altar came yet another,
the angel who has authority over fire,
and he called aloud to the one with the
sharp sickle: Put in your sharp sickle,
and gather in earth's grape harvest, for
its clusters are ripe.
19 So the angel swept over the earth
with his sickle and gathered in its grapes,
and threw them into the great winepress
of God's wrath.
20 The winepress was trodden outside
the city, and for a distance of two
hundred miles blood flowed from the
press to the height of horses' bridles.
1 THEN I saw in heaven another
great and astonishing sign: seven
angels with seven plagues, the last
15Revelation 15.2–7
39
plagues of all, for with them the wrath of
God was completed.
2 I saw what looked like a sea of glass
shot through with fire. Standing beside
it and holding the harps which God had
given them were those who had been
victorious against the beast, its image,
and the number of its name.
3 They were singing the song of Moses,
the servant of God, and the song of the
Lamb: Great and marvellous are your
deeds, O Lord God, sovereign over all;
just and true are your ways, O King of
the ages.
4 Who shall not fear you, Lord, and do
homage to your name? For you alone are
holy. All nations shall come and worship
before you, for your just decrees stand
revealed.
5 After this, as I looked, the sanctuary
of the heavenly Tent of Testimony was
opened,
6 and from it came the seven angels
with the seven plagues. They were robed
in fine linen, pure and shining, and had
golden girdles round their breasts.
7 One of the four living creatures gave
to the seven angels seven golden bowlsRevelation 15.8–16.5
40
full of the wrath of God who lives for
ever.
8 The sanctuary was filled with smoke
from the glory of God and from his
power, so that no one could enter it until
the seven plagues of the seven angels
were completed.
1 I heard a loud voice from the
sanctuary say to the seven
angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls
of God's wrath on the earth.
2 The first angel went and poured out
his bowl on the earth; and foul malignant
sores appeared on the men that wore
the mark of the beast and worshipped
its image.
3 The second angel poured out his bowl
on the sea; and the sea turned to blood
like the blood from a dead body, and
every living thing in it died.
4 The third angel poured out his bowl on
the rivers and springs, and they turned
to blood.
5 And I heard the angel of the
waters say, You are just in these your
judgements, you who are, and were, O
Holy One;
16Revelation 16.6– 13
41
6 for they shed the blood of your people
and your prophets, and blood you have
given them to drink. They have what
they deserve!
7 I heard a voice from the altar cry, Yes,
Lord God, sovereign over all, true and
just are your judgements!
8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl
on the sun; and it was allowed to burn
people with its flames.
9 They were severely burned, and
cursed the name of God who had the
power to inflict such plagues, but they
did not repent and do him homage.
10 The fifth angel poured out his bowl on
the throne of the beast; and its kingdom
was plunged into darkness. Men gnawed
their tongues in agony,
11 and cursed the God of heaven for
their pain and sores, but they would not
repent of what they had done.
12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl
on the Great River, the Euphrates; and
its water was dried up to prepare a way
for the kings from the east.
13 I saw three foul spirits like frogs
coming from the mouths of the dragon,
the beast, and the false prophet.Revelation 16.14–21
42
14 These are demonic spirits with power
to work miracles, sent out to muster all
the kings of the world for the battle on
the great day of God the sovereign Lord.
15 (See, I am coming like a thief! Happy
the man who stays awake, and keeps his
clothes at hand so that he will not have
to go naked and ashamed for all to see!)
16 These spirits assembled the kings at
the place called in Hebrew Armageddon.
17 The seventh angel poured out his
bowl on the air; and out of the sanctuary
came a loud voice from the throne,
which said, It is over!
18 There followed flashes of lightning
and peals of thunder, and a violent
earthquake, so violent that nothing like
it had ever happened in human history.
19 THE great city was split in three, and
the cities of the nations collapsed in ruin.
God did not forget Babylon the great,
but made her drink the cup which was
filled with the fierce wine of his wrath.
20 Every island vanished, and not a
mountain was to be seen.
21 Huge hailstones, weighing as much
as a hundredweight, crashed down from
the sky on the people; and they cursedRevelation 17.1–6
43
God because the plague of hail was so
severe.
1 ONE of the seven angels who
held the seven bowls came and
spoke to me; Come, he said, I will show
you the verdict on the great whore, she
who is enthroned over many waters.
2 The kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her, and people the
world over have made themselves drunk
on the wine of her fornication.
3 He carried me in spirit into the
wilderness, and I saw a woman mounted
on a scarlet beast which was covered
with blasphemous names and had seven
heads and ten horns.
4 The woman was clothed in purple and
scarlet, and decked out with gold and
precious stones and pearls. In her hand
she held a gold cup full of obscenities
and the foulness of her fornication.
5 Written on her forehead was a name
with a secret meaning: Babylon the
great, the mother of whores and of every
obscenity on earth.
6 I saw that the woman was drunk with
the blood of God's people, and with
the blood of those who had borne their
17Revelation 17.7– 11
44
testimony to Jesus. At the sight of her I
was greatly astonished.
7 But the angel said to me, Why are you
astonished? I will tell you the secret of
the woman and of the beast she rides,
with the seven heads and the ten horns.
8 The beast you saw was once alive,
and is alive no longer, but has yet to
ascend out of the abyss before going
to be destroyed. All the inhabitants
of the earth whose names have not
been written in the book of life since
the foundation of the world will be
astonished to see the beast, which once
was alive, and is alive no longer, and has
still to appear.
9 This calls for a mind with insight. The
seven heads are seven hills on which the
woman sits enthroned.
10 They also represent seven kings: five
have already fallen, one is now reigning,
and the other has yet to come. When he
does come, he is to last for only a little
while.
11 As for the beast that once was alive
and is alive no longer, he is an eighth --
and yet he is one of the seven, and he is
going to destruction.Revelation 17.12–17
45
12 The ten horns you saw are ten kings
who have not yet begun to reign, but
who for a brief hour will share royal
authority with the beast.
13 They have a single purpose and will
confer their power and authority on the
beast.
14 They will wage war on the Lamb,
but the Lamb will conquer them, for he
is Lord of lords and King of kings, and
those who are with him are called and
chosen and faithful.
15 He continued: The waters you saw,
where the great whore sat enthroned,
represent nations, populations, races,
and languages.
16 As for the ten horns you saw, and the
beast, they will come to hate the whore.
They will strip her naked and leave her
destitute; they will devour her flesh and
burn her up.
17 For God has put it into their minds
to carry out his purpose, by making
common cause and conferring their
sovereignty on the beast until God's
words are fulfilled.Revelation 17.18–18.6
46
18 The woman you saw is the great city
that holds sway over the kings of the
earth.
1 After this I saw another angel
coming down from heaven; he
possessed great authority and the earth
shone with his splendour.
2 In a mighty voice he proclaimed,
Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She
has become a dwelling for demons, a
haunt for every unclean spirit, for every
unclean and loathsome bird.
3 All the nations have drunk the wine of
God's anger roused by her fornication;
the kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her, and merchants
the world over have grown rich on her
wealth and luxury.
4 I heard another voice from heaven
saying: Come out from her, my people,
lest you have any part in her sins and
you share in her plagues,
5 for her sins are piled high as heaven,
and God has not forgotten her crimes.
6 Pay her back in her own coin, repay
her twice over for her deeds! Give her
a potion twice as strong as the one she
mixed!
18Revelation 18.7– 13
47
7 Measure out torment and grief to
match her pomp and luxury! I am a
queen on my throne! she says to herself.
No widow's weeds for me, no mourning!
8 That is why plagues shall strike her in
a single day, pestilence, bereavement,
and famine, and she shall perish in
flames; for mighty is the Lord God who
has pronounced her doom!
9 The kings of the earth who committed
fornication with her and wallowed in her
luxury will weep and wail over her, as
they see the smoke of her burning.
10 In terror at her torment they will keep
their distance and say, Alas, alas for you
great city, mighty city of Babylon! In a
moment your doom has come upon you!
11 The merchants of the world will weep
and mourn for her, because no one buys
their cargoes any more,
12 cargoes of gold and silver, precious
stones and pearls, purple and scarlet
cloth, silks and fine linens; all sorts of
fragrant wood, and all kinds of objects
made of ivory or of costly woods, bronze,
iron, or marble;
13 cinnamon and spice, incense,
perfumes, and frankincense; wine,Revelation 18.14–19
48
oil, flour and wheat, cattle and sheep,
horses, chariots, slaves, and human
lives.
14 The harvest you longed for, they will
say, is gone from you; all the glitter
and glamour are lost, never to be found
again!
15 The traders in all these goods, who
grew rich on her, will keep their distance
in terror at her torment; weeping and
mourning
16 they will say: Alas, alas for the great
city that was clothed in fine linen and
purple and scarlet, decked out with gold
and precious stones and pearls!
17 So much wealth laid waste in a
moment! All the sea-captains and
voyagers, the sailors and those who
made a living on the sea, stayed at a
distance;
18 as they saw the smoke of her
burning, they cried out, Was there ever
a city like the great city?
19 They threw dust on their heads and,
weeping and mourning, they cried aloud:
Alas, alas for the great city, where all
who had ships at sea grew rich from herRevelation 18.20–19.1
49
prosperity! In a single hour she has been
laid waste!
20 But let heaven exult over her; exult,
God's people, apostles and prophets, for
he has imposed on her the sentence she
passed on you!
21 Then a mighty angel picked up a
stone like a great millstone and hurled it
into the sea, saying, Thus shall Babylon,
the great city, be sent hurtling down,
never to be seen again!
22 The sound of harpists and minstrels,
flute-players and trumpeters, shall no
more be heard in you; no more shall
craftsmen of any trade be found in you,
or the sound of the mill be heard in you;
23 no more shall the light of the lamp
appear in you, no more the voices of the
bridegroom and bride be heard in you!
Your traders were once the merchant
princes of the world, and with your
sorcery you deceived all the nations.
24 The blood of the prophets and of
God's people was found in her, the blood
of all who had been slain on earth.
1 After this I heard what sounded
like a vast throng in heaven
19Revelation 19.2–7
50
shouting: Hallelujah! Victory and glory
and power belong to our God,
2 for true and just are his judgements!
He has condemned the great whore who
corrupted the earth with her fornication;
he has taken vengeance on her for the
blood of his servants.
3 Once more they shouted: Hallelujah!
The smoke from her burning will rise for
ever!
4 The twenty-four elders and the
four living creatures bowed down and
worshipped God who sits on the throne;
they cried: Amen! Hallelujah!
5 THERE came a voice from the throne
saying: Praise our God, all you his
servants, you that fear him, both small
and great!
6 And I heard what sounded like a
vast throng, like the sound of a mighty
torrent or of great peals of thunder, and
they cried: Hallelujah! The Lord our God,
sovereign over all, has entered on his
reign!
7 Let us rejoice and shout for joy and
pay homage to him, for the wedding day
of the Lamb has come! His bride has
made herself ready,Revelation 19.8– 13
51
8 and she has been given fine linen,
shining and clean, to wear. (The fine
linen signifies the righteous deeds of
God's people.)
9 THE angel said to me, Write this:
Happy are those who are invited to the
wedding banquet of the Lamb! He added,
These are the very words of God.
10 I prostrated myself to worship him,
but he said, You must not do that! I
am a fellow-servant with you and your
brothers who bear their witness to Jesus.
It is God you must worship. For those
who bear witness to Jesus have the spirit
of prophecy.
11 I SAW heaven wide open, and a
white horse appeared; its rider's name
was Faithful and True, for he is just in
judgement and just in war.
12 His eyes flamed like fire, and on his
head were many diadems. Written on
him was a name known to none but
himself;
13 he was robed in a garment dyed in
blood, and he was called the Word of
God.Revelation 19.14–20
52
14 The armies of heaven followed him,
riding on white horses and clothed in fine
linen, white and clean.
15 Out of his mouth came a sharp sword
to smite the nations; for it is he who will
rule them with a rod of iron, and tread
the winepress of the fierce wrath of God
the sovereign Lord.
16 On his robe and on his thigh was
written the title: King of kings and Lord
of lords.
17 I saw an angel standing in the sun.
He cried aloud to all the birds flying in
mid-heaven: Come, gather together for
God's great banquet,
18 to eat the flesh of kings, commanders,
and warriors, the flesh of horses and
their riders, the flesh of all, the free and
the slave, the small and the great!
19 I saw the beast and the kings of the
earth with their armies mustered to do
battle against the rider and his army.
20 The beast was taken prisoner, along
with the false prophet who had worked
miracles in its presence and deluded
those who had received the mark of the
beast and worshipped its image. The twoRevelation 19.21–20.4
53
of them were thrown alive into the lake
of fire with its sulphurous flames.
21 The rest were killed by the sword
which came out of the rider's mouth, and
the birds all gorged themselves on their
flesh.
1 I saw an angel coming down
from heaven with the key to the
abyss and a great chain in his hand.
2 He seized the dragon, that ancient
serpent who is the Devil, or Satan, and
chained him up for a thousand years;
3 he threw him into the abyss, shutting
and sealing it over him, so that he might
not seduce the nations again till the
thousand years were ended. After that
he must be let loose for a little while.
4 I saw thrones, and on them sat those
to whom judgement was committed. I
saw the souls of those who, for the sake
of God's word and their witness to Jesus,
had been beheaded, those who had not
worshipped the beast and its image or
received its mark on forehead or hand.
They came to life again and reigned with
Christ for a thousand years,
20Revelation 20.5– 11
54
5 though the rest of the dead did not
come to life until the thousand years
were ended. This is the first resurrection.
6 Blessed and holy are those who share
in this first resurrection! Over them the
second death has no power; but they
shall be priests of God and of Christ, and
shall reign with him for the thousand
years.
7 When the thousand years are ended,
Satan will be let loose from his prison,
8 and he will come out to seduce the
nations in the four quarters of the earth.
He will muster them for war, the hosts of
Gog and Magog, countless as the sands
of the sea.
9 They marched over the breadth of the
land and laid siege to the camp of God's
people and the city that he loves. But
fire came down on them from heaven
and consumed them.
10 Their seducer, the Devil, was flung
into the lake of fire and sulphur, where
the beast and the false prophet had been
flung to be tormented day and night for
ever.
11 I saw a great, white throne, and the
One who sits upon it. From his presenceRevelation 20.12–21.3
55
earth and heaven fled away, and there
was no room for them any more.
12 I saw the dead, great and small,
standing before the throne; and books
were opened. Then another book, the
book of life, was opened. The dead
were judged by what they had done, as
recorded in these books.
13 The sea gave up the dead that were
in it, and Death and Hades gave up the
dead in their keeping. Everyone was
judged on the record of his deeds.
14 Then Death and Hades were flung
into the lake of fire. This lake of fire is
the second death;
15 into it were flung any whose names
were not to be found in the book of life.
1 I SAW a new heaven and a new
earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had vanished, and there was
no longer any sea.
2 I saw the Holy City, new Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God,
made ready like a bride adorned for her
husband.
3 I heard a loud voice proclaiming from
the throne: Now God has his dwelling
with mankind! He will dwell among them
21Revelation 21.4–9
56
and they shall be his people, and God
himself will be with them.
4 He will wipe every tear from their
eyes. There shall be an end to death,
and to mourning and crying and pain,
for the old order has passed away!
5 The One who sat on the throne said,
I am making all things new! (Write
this down, he said, for these words are
trustworthy and true.)
6 Then he said to me, It is done! I am
the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning
and the end. To the thirsty I will give
water from the spring of life as a gift.
7 This is the victors heritage; and I
will be their God and they will be my
children.
8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless,
and the obscene, the murderers,
fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and liars
of every kind, the lake that burns with
sulphurous flames will be their portion,
and that is the second death.'
9 ONE of the seven angels who held
the seven bowls full of the seven last
plagues came and spoke to me. Come,
he said, and I will show you the bride,
the wife of the Lamb.Revelation 21.10–16
57
10 So in the spirit he carried me away to
a great and lofty mountain, and showed
me Jerusalem, the Holy City, coming
down out of heaven from God.
11 It shone with the glory of God; it had
the radiance of some priceless jewel, like
a jasper, clear as crystal.
12 It had a great and lofty wall with
twelve gates, at which were stationed
twelve angels; on the gates were
inscribed the names of the twelve tribes
of Israel.
13 There were three gates to the east,
three to the north, three to the south,
and three to the west.
14 The city wall had twelve foundation-
stones, and on them were the names of
the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
15 The angel who spoke with me carried
a gold measuring rod to measure the
city, its gates, and its wall.
16 The city had four sides, and it was
as wide as it was long. Measured by his
rod, it was twelve thousand furlongs,
its length and breadth and height being
equal.Revelation 21.17–23
58
17 Its wall was one hundred and
forty-four cubits high, by human
measurements, which the angel used.
18 The wall was built of jasper, while
the city itself was of pure gold, bright as
clear glass.
19 The foundations of the city wall were
adorned with precious stones of every
kind, the first of the foundation-stones
being jasper, the second lapis lazuli, the
third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth cornelian,
the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl,
the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase,
the eleventh turquoise, and the twelfth
amethyst.
21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls,
each gate fashioned from a single pearl.
The great street of the city was of pure
gold, like translucent glass.
22 I saw no temple in the city, for its
temple was the sovereign Lord God and
the Lamb.
23 The city did not need the sun or the
moon to shine on it, for the glory of God
gave it light, and its lamp was the Lamb.Revelation 21.24–22.4
59
24 By its light shall the nations walk,
and to it the kings of the earth shall
bring their splendour.
25 The gates of the city shall never be
shut by day, nor will there be any night
there.
26 The splendour and wealth of the
nations shall be brought into it,
27 but nothing unclean shall enter, nor
anyone whose ways are foul or false;
only those shall enter whose names are
inscribed in the Lamb's book of life.
1 Then the angel showed me the
river of the water of life, sparkling
like crystal, flowing from the throne of
God and of the Lamb
2 down the middle of the city's street.
On either side of the river stood a tree of
life, which yields twelve crops of fruit,
one for each month of the year. The
leaves of the trees are for the healing of
the nations.
3 Every accursed thing shall disappear.
The throne of God and of the Lamb will
be there, and his servants shall worship
him;
4 they shall see him face to face and
bear his name on their foreheads.
22Revelation 22.5– 11
60
5 There shall be no more night, nor will
they need the light of lamp or sun, for
the Lord God will give them light; and
they shall reign for ever.
6 HE said to me, These words are
trustworthy and true. The Lord God who
inspires the prophets has sent his angel
to show his servants what must soon
take place.
7 And remember, I am coming soon!
Happy is the man who takes to heart
the words of prophecy contained in this
book!
8 It was I, John, who heard and saw
these things. When I had heard and seen
them, I prostrated myself to worship the
angel who had shown them to me.
9 But he said, You must not do that! I
am a fellow-servant with you and your
brothers the prophets and with those
who take to heart the words of this book.
It is God you must worship.
10 He told me, Do not seal up the words
of the prophecy that are in this book, for
the time of fulfilment is near.
11 Meanwhile, let the evildoers persist in
doing evil and the filthy-minded continue
in their filth, but let the good persevereRevelation 22.12–18
61
in their goodness and the holy continue
in holiness.
12 I am coming soon, and bringing with
me my recompense to repay everyone
according to what he has done!
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
first and the last, the beginning and the
end.
14 Happy are those who wash their
robes clean! They shall be free to eat
from the tree of life and may enter the
city by the gates.
15 Outside are the perverts, the
sorcerers and fornicators, the murderers
and idolaters, and all who love and
practise deceit.
16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to you
with this testimony for the churches.
I am the offspring of David, the shoot
growing from his stock, the bright star of
dawn.
17 Come! say the Spirit and the bride.
Come! let each hearer reply. Let the
thirsty come; let whoever wishes accept
the water of life as a gift.
18 I, John, give this warning to everyone
who is listening to the words of prophecy
in this book: if anyone adds to them, GodRevelation 22.19–21
62
will add to him the plagues described in
this book;
19 if anyone takes away from the words
in this book of prophecy, God will take
away from him his share in the tree
of life and in the Holy City, which are
described in this book.
20 He who gives this testimony says:
Yes, I am coming soon! Amen. Come,
Lord Jesus!
21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with
all.
