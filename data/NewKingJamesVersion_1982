1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus
Christ, the Son of David, the Son of
Abraham:
2 Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot
Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his
brothers.
3 Judah begot Perez and Zerah by
Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron
begot Ram.
4 Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab
begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot
Salmon.
5 Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz
begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,
6 and Jesse begot David the king. David
the king begot Solomon by her who had
been the wife of Uriah.MATTHEW 1
2
7 Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam
begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.
8 Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat
begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.
9 Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot
Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.
10 Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh
begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
11 Josiah begot Jeconiah and his
brothers about the me they were
carried away to Babylon.
12 And a er they were brought to
Babylon, Jeconiah begot Sheal el, and
Sheal el begot Zerubbabel.
13 Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot
Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.
14 Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot
Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.
15 Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot
Ma han, and Ma han begot Jacob.MATTHEW 1
3
16 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband
of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is
called Christ.
17 So all the genera ons from Abraham
to David are fourteen genera ons, from
David un l the cap vity in Babylon are
fourteen genera ons, and from the
cap vity in Babylon un l the Christ are
fourteen genera ons.
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was
as follows: A er His mother Mary was
betrothed to Joseph, before they came
together, she was found with child of the
Holy Spirit.
19 Then Joseph her husband, being a
just man, and not wan ng to make her a
public example, was minded to put her
away secretly.
20 But while he thought about these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying,
"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraidMATTHEW 1 – 2
4
to take to you Mary your wife, for that
which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Spirit.
21 "And she will bring forth a Son, and
you shall call His name JESUS, for He will
save His people from their sins."
22 So all this was done that it might be
fulﬁlled which was spoken by the Lord
through the prophet, saying:
23 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
and bear a Son, and they shall call His
name Immanuel," which is translated,
"God with us."
24 Then Joseph, being aroused from
sleep, did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him and took to him his
wife,
25 and did not know her ll she had
brought forth her ﬁrstborn Son. And he
called His name JESUS.
1 Now a er Jesus was born in
Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
2MATTHEW 2
5
Herod the king, behold, wise men from
the East came to Jerusalem,
2 saying, "Where is He who has been
born King of the Jews? For we have seen
His star in the East and have come to
worship Him."
3 When Herod the king heard this, he
was troubled, and all Jerusalem with
him.
4 And when he had gathered all the
chief priests and scribes of the people
together, he inquired of them where the
Christ was to be born.
5 So they said to him, "In Bethlehem
of Judea, for thus it is wri en by the
prophet:
6 ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of
Judah, Are not the least among the
rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come
a Ruler Who will shepherd My people
Israel.’"MATTHEW 2
6
7 Then Herod, when he had secretly
called the wise men, determined from
them what me the star appeared.
8 And he sent them to Bethlehem and
said, "Go and search carefully for the
young Child, and when you have found
Him, bring back word to me, that I may
come and worship Him also."
9 When they heard the king, they
departed; and behold, the star which
they had seen in the East went before
them, ll it came and stood over where
the young Child was.
10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced
with exceedingly great joy.
11 And when they had come into the
house, they saw the young Child with
Mary His mother, and fell down and
worshiped Him. And when they had
opened their treasures, they presented
gi s to Him: gold, frankincense, and
myrrh.MATTHEW 2
7
12 Then, being divinely warned in a
dream that they should not return to
Herod, they departed for their own
country another way.
13 Now when they had departed,
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise,
take the young Child and His mother,
ﬂee to Egypt, and stay there un l I bring
you word; for Herod will seek the young
Child to destroy Him."
14 When he arose, he took the young
Child and His mother by night and
departed for Egypt,
15 and was there un l the death of
Herod, that it might be fulﬁlled which
was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called
My Son."
16 Then Herod, when he saw that he
was deceived by the wise men, was
exceedingly angry; and he sent forth andMATTHEW 2
8
put to death all the male children who
were in Bethlehem and in all its districts,
from two years old and under, according
to the me which he had determined
from the wise men.
17 Then was fulﬁlled what was spoken
by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
18 "A voice was heard in Ramah,
Lamenta on, weeping, and great
mourning, Rachel weeping for her
children, Refusing to be comforted,
Because they are no more."
19 But when Herod was dead, behold,
an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream
to Joseph in Egypt,
20 saying, "Arise, take the young Child
and His mother, and go to the land of
Israel, for those who sought the young
Child’s life are dead."
21 Then he arose, took the young Child
and His mother, and came into the land
of Israel.MATTHEW 2 – 3
9
22 But when he heard that Archelaus
was reigning over Judea instead of his
father Herod, he was afraid to go there.
And being warned by God in a dream, he
turned aside into the region of Galilee.
23 And he came and dwelt in a city
called Nazareth, that it might be fulﬁlled
which was spoken by the prophets, "He
shall be called a Nazarene."
1 In those days John the Bap st came
preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
2 and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand!"
3 For this is he who was spoken of by
the prophet Isaiah, saying: "The voice of
one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare
the way of the LORD; Make His paths
straight.’"
4 And John himself was clothed in
camel’s hair, with a leather belt around
his waist; and his food was locusts and
wild honey.
3MATTHEW 3
10
5 Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the
region around the Jordan went out to
him
6 and were bap zed by him in the
Jordan, confessing their sins.
7 But when he saw many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his
bap sm, he said to them, "Brood of
vipers! Who warned you to ﬂee from the
wrath to come?
8 "Therefore bear fruits worthy of
repentance,
9 "and do not think to say to yourselves,
‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I
say to you that God is able to raise up
children to Abraham from these stones.
10 "And even now the ax is laid to the
root of the trees. Therefore every tree
which does not bear good fruit is cut
down and thrown into the ﬁre.
11 "I indeed bap ze you with water unto
repentance, but He who is coming a erMATTHEW 3
11
me is migh er than I, whose sandals I
am not worthy to carry. He will bap ze
you with the Holy Spirit and ﬁre.
12 "His winnowing fan is in His hand,
and He will thoroughly clean out His
threshing ﬂoor, and gather His wheat
into the barn; but He will burn up the
chaﬀ with unquenchable ﬁre."
13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John
at the Jordan to be bap zed by him.
14 And John tried to prevent Him,
saying, "I need to be bap zed by You,
and are You coming to me?"
15 But Jesus answered and said to him,
"Permit it to be so now, for thus it is
ﬁ ng for us to fulﬁll all righteousness."
Then he allowed Him.
16 When He had been bap zed, Jesus
came up immediately from the water;
and behold, the heavens were opened
to Him, and He saw the Spirit of GodMATTHEW 3 – 4
12
descending like a dove and aligh ng
upon Him.
17 And suddenly a voice came from
heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased."
1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit
into the wilderness to be tempted by
the devil.
2 And when He had fasted forty days
and forty nights, a erward He was
hungry.
3 Now when the tempter came to Him,
he said, "If You are the Son of God,
command that these stones become
bread."
4 But He answered and said, "It is
wri en, ‘Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceeds
from the mouth of God.’"
5 Then the devil took Him up into the
holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the
temple,
4MATTHEW 4
13
6 and said to Him, "If You are the Son
of God, throw Yourself down. For it is
wri en: ‘He shall give His angels charge
over you,’ and, ‘In their hands they shall
bear you up, Lest you dash your foot
against a stone.’"
7 Jesus said to him, "It is wri en again,
‘You shall not tempt the LORD your
God.’"
8 Again, the devil took Him up on an
exceedingly high mountain, and showed
Him all the kingdoms of the world and
their glory.
9 And he said to Him, "All these things
I will give You if You will fall down and
worship me."
10 Then Jesus said to him, "Away with
you, Satan! For it is wri en, ‘You shall
worship the LORD your God, and Him
only you shall serve.’"
11 Then the devil le Him, and behold,
angels came and ministered to Him.MATTHEW 4
14
12 Now when Jesus heard that John
had been put in prison, He departed to
Galilee.
13 And leaving Nazareth, He came and
dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea,
in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
14 that it might be fulﬁlled which was
spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
15 "The land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali, By the way of the sea, beyond
the Jordan, Galilee of the Gen les:
16 The people who sat in darkness have
seen a great light, And upon those who
sat in the region and shadow of death
Light has dawned."
17 From that me Jesus began to preach
and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand."
18 And Jesus, walking by the Sea
of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon
called Peter, and Andrew his brother,MATTHEW 4
15
cas ng a net into the sea; for they were
ﬁshermen.
19 Then He said to them, "Follow Me,
and I will make you ﬁshers of men."
20 They immediately le their nets and
followed Him.
21 Going on from there, He saw two
other brothers, James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
boat with Zebedee their father, mending
their nets. He called them,
22 and immediately they le the boat
and their father, and followed Him.
23 And Jesus went about all Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, preaching
the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
all kinds of sickness and all kinds of
disease among the people.
24 Then His fame went throughout all
Syria; and they brought to Him all sick
people who were aﬄicted with various
diseases and torments, and those whoMATTHEW 4 – 5
16
were demon–possessed, epilep cs, and
paraly cs; and He healed them.
25 Great mul tudes followed Him–
–from Galilee, and from Decapolis,
Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the
Jordan.
1 And seeing the mul tudes, He went
up on a mountain, and when He was
seated His disciples came to Him.
2 Then He opened His mouth and
taught them, saying:
3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, For
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are those who mourn, For
they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek, For they shall
inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for righteousness, For they shall be
ﬁlled.
7 Blessed are the merciful, For they
shall obtain mercy.
5MATTHEW 5
17
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, For they
shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers, For they
shall be called sons of God.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted
for righteousness’ sake, For theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.
11 "Blessed are you when they revile
and persecute you, and say all kinds of
evil against you falsely for My sake.
12 "Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for
great is your reward in heaven, for so
they persecuted the prophets who were
before you.
13 "You are the salt of the earth; but if
the salt loses its ﬂavor, how shall it be
seasoned? It is then good for nothing
but to be thrown out and trampled
underfoot by men.
14 "You are the light of the world. A city
that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.MATTHEW 5
18
15 "Nor do they light a lamp and put it
under a basket, but on a lampstand, and
it gives light to all who are in the house.
16 "Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works and
glorify your Father in heaven.
17 "Do not think that I came to destroy
the Law or the Prophets. I did not come
to destroy but to fulﬁll.
18 "For assuredly, I say to you, ll
heaven and earth pass away, one jot or
one le will by no means pass from the
law ll all is fulﬁlled.
19 "Whoever therefore breaks one of
the least of these commandments, and
teaches men so, shall be called least in
the kingdom of heaven; but whoever
does and teaches them, he shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 "For I say to you, that unless your
righteousness exceeds the righteousnessMATTHEW 5
19
of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by
no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
21 "You have heard that it was said to
those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and
whoever murders will be in danger of
the judgment.’
22 "But I say to you that whoever is
angry with his brother without a cause
shall be in danger of the judgment. And
whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall
be in danger of the council. But whoever
says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hell
ﬁre.
23 "Therefore if you bring your gi to
the altar, and there remember that your
brother has something against you,
24 "leave your gi there before the altar,
and go your way. First be reconciled to
your brother, and then come and oﬀer
your gi .
25 "Agree with your adversary quickly,
while you are on the way with him, lestMATTHEW 5
20
your adversary deliver you to the judge,
the judge hand you over to the oﬃcer,
and you be thrown into prison.
26 "Assuredly, I say to you, you will by
no means get out of there ll you have
paid the last penny.
27 "You have heard that it was said
to those of old, ‘You shall not commit
adultery.’
28 "But I say to you that whoever looks
at a woman to lust for her has already
commi ed adultery with her in his heart.
29 "If your right eye causes you to sin,
pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is
more proﬁtable for you that one of your
members perish, than for your whole
body to be cast into hell.
30 "And if your right hand causes you to
sin, cut it oﬀ and cast it from you; for it is
more proﬁtable for you that one of your
members perish, than for your whole
body to be cast into hell.MATTHEW 5
21
31 "Furthermore it has been said,
‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give
her a cer ﬁcate of divorce.’
32 "But I say to you that whoever
divorces his wife for any reason except
sexual immorality causes her to commit
adultery; and whoever marries a woman
who is divorced commits adultery.
33 "Again you have heard that it was
said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear
falsely, but shall perform your oaths to
the Lord.’
34 "But I say to you, do not swear at all:
neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;
35 "nor by the earth, for it is His
footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the
city of the great King.
36 "Nor shall you swear by your head,
because you cannot make one hair white
or black.MATTHEW 5
22
37 "But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your
‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than
these is from the evil one.
38 "You have heard that it was said, ‘An
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
39 "But I tell you not to resist an evil
person. But whoever slaps you on your
right cheek, turn the other to him also.
40 "If anyone wants to sue you and take
away your tunic, let him have your cloak
also.
41 "And whoever compels you to go one
mile, go with him two.
42 "Give to him who asks you, and from
him who wants to borrow from you do
not turn away.
43 "You have heard that it was said, ‘You
shall love your neighbor and hate your
enemy.’
44 "But I say to you, love your enemies,
bless those who curse you, do good to
those who hate you, and pray for thoseMATTHEW 5 – 6
23
who spitefully use you and persecute
you,
45 "that you may be sons of your Father
in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on
the evil and on the good, and sends rain
on the just and on the unjust.
46 "For if you love those who love you,
what reward have you? Do not even the
tax collectors do the same?
47 "And if you greet your brethren only,
what do you do more than others? Do
not even the tax collectors do so?
48 "Therefore you shall be perfect, just
as your Father in heaven is perfect.
1 "Take heed that you do not do your
charitable deeds before men, to be
seen by them. Otherwise you have no
reward from your Father in heaven.
2 "Therefore, when you do a charitable
deed, do not sound a trumpet before you
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
and in the streets, that they may have
6MATTHEW 6
24
glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you,
they have their reward.
3 "But when you do a charitable deed,
do not let your le hand know what your
right hand is doing,
4 "that your charitable deed may be
in secret; and your Father who sees in
secret will Himself reward you openly.
5 "And when you pray, you shall not be
like the hypocrites. For they love to pray
standing in the synagogues and on the
corners of the streets, that they may be
seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you,
they have their reward.
6 "But you, when you pray, go into your
room, and when you have shut your
door, pray to your Father who is in the
secret place; and your Father who sees
in secret will reward you openly.
7 "And when you pray, do not use vain
repe ons as the heathen do. For theyMATTHEW 6
25
think that they will be heard for their
many words.
8 "Therefore do not be like them. For
your Father knows the things you have
need of before you ask Him.
9 "In this manner, therefore, pray: Our
Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your
name.
10 Your kingdom come. Your will be
done On earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us this day our daily bread.
12 And forgive us our debts, As we
forgive our debtors.
13 And do not lead us into tempta on,
But deliver us from the evil one. For
Yours is the kingdom and the power and
the glory forever. Amen.
14 "For if you forgive men their
trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you.MATTHEW 6
26
15 "But if you do not forgive men their
trespasses, neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses.
16 "Moreover, when you fast, do not
be like the hypocrites, with a sad
countenance. For they disﬁgure their
faces that they may appear to men to be
fas ng. Assuredly, I say to you, they have
their reward.
17 "But you, when you fast, anoint your
head and wash your face,
18 "so that you do not appear to men to
be fas ng, but to your Father who is in
the secret place; and your Father who
sees in secret will reward you openly.
19 "Do not lay up for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust
destroy and where thieves break in and
steal;
20 "but lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rustMATTHEW 6
27
destroys and where thieves do not break
in and steal.
21 "For where your treasure is, there
your heart will be also.
22 "The lamp of the body is the eye. If
therefore your eye is good, your whole
body will be full of light.
23 "But if your eye is bad, your whole
body will be full of darkness. If therefore
the light that is in you is darkness, how
great is that darkness!
24 "No one can serve two masters; for
either he will hate the one and love the
other, or else he will be loyal to the one
and despise the other. You cannot serve
God and mammon.
25 "Therefore I say to you, do not worry
about your life, what you will eat or
what you will drink; nor about your
body, what you will put on. Is not life
more than food and the body more than
clothing?MATTHEW 6
28
26 "Look at the birds of the air, for they
neither sow nor reap nor gather into
barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds
them. Are you not of more value than
they?
27 "Which of you by worrying can add
one cubit to his stature?
28 "So why do you worry about
clothing? Consider the lilies of the ﬁeld,
how they grow: they neither toil nor
spin;
29 "and yet I say to you that even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these.
30 "Now if God so clothes the grass of
the ﬁeld, which today is, and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven, will He not
much more clothe you, O you of li le
faith?
31 "Therefore do not worry, saying,
‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we
drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’MATTHEW 6 – 7
32 "For a
29
er all these things the Gen les
seek. For your heavenly Father knows
that you need all these things.
33 "But seek ﬁrst the kingdom of God
and His righteousness, and all these
things shall be added to you.
34 "Therefore do not worry about
tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry
about its own things. Suﬃcient for the
day is its own trouble.
1 "Judge not, that you be not judged.
2 "For with what judgment you
judge, you will be judged; and with the
measure you use, it will be measured
back to you.
3 "And why do you look at the speck in
your brother’s eye, but do not consider
the plank in your own eye?
4 "Or how can you say to your brother,
‘Let me remove the speck from your
eye’; and look, a plank is in your own
eye?
7MATTHEW 7
30
5 "Hypocrite! First remove the plank
from your own eye, and then you will
see clearly to remove the speck from
your brother’s eye.
6 "Do not give what is holy to the dogs;
nor cast your pearls before swine, lest
they trample them under their feet, and
turn and tear you in pieces.
7 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek,
and you will ﬁnd; knock, and it will be
opened to you.
8 "For everyone who asks receives, and
he who seeks ﬁnds, and to him who
knocks it will be opened.
9 "Or what man is there among you
who, if his son asks for bread, will give
him a stone?
10 "Or if he asks for a ﬁsh, will he give
him a serpent?
11 "If you then, being evil, know how
to give good gi s to your children, how
much more will your Father who is inMATTHEW 7
31
heaven give good things to those who
ask Him!
12 "Therefore, whatever you want men
to do to you, do also to them, for this is
the Law and the Prophets.
13 "Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is
the gate and broad is the way that leads
to destruc on, and there are many who
go in by it.
14 "Because narrow is the gate and
diﬃcult is the way which leads to life,
and there are few who ﬁnd it.
15 "Beware of false prophets, who come
to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly
they are ravenous wolves.
16 "You will know them by their fruits.
Do men gather grapes from thornbushes
or ﬁgs from thistles?
17 "Even so, every good tree bears good
fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
18 "A good tree cannot bear bad fruit,
nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.MATTHEW 7
32
19 "Every tree that does not bear good
fruit is cut down and thrown into the
ﬁre.
20 "Therefore by their fruits you will
know them.
21 "Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord,
Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven,
but he who does the will of My Father in
heaven.
22 "Many will say to Me in that day,
‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
Your name, cast out demons in Your
name, and done many wonders in Your
name?’
23 "And then I will declare to them, ‘I
never knew you; depart from Me, you
who prac ce lawlessness!’
24 "Therefore whoever hears these
sayings of Mine, and does them, I will
liken him to a wise man who built his
house on the rock:MATTHEW 7 – 8
33
25 "and the rain descended, the ﬂoods
came, and the winds blew and beat on
that house; and it did not fall, for it was
founded on the rock.
26 "But everyone who hears these
sayings of Mine, and does not do them,
will be like a foolish man who built his
house on the sand:
27 "and the rain descended, the ﬂoods
came, and the winds blew and beat on
that house; and it fell. And great was its
fall."
28 And so it was, when Jesus had ended
these sayings, that the people were
astonished at His teaching,
29 for He taught them as one having
authority, and not as the scribes.
1 When He had come down from the
mountain, great mul tudes followed
Him.
8MATTHEW 8
34
2 And behold, a leper came and
worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, if You are
willing, You can make me clean."
3 Then Jesus put out His hand and
touched him, saying, "I am willing; be
cleansed." Immediately his leprosy was
cleansed.
4 And Jesus said to him, "See that you
tell no one; but go your way, show
yourself to the priest, and oﬀer the gi
that Moses commanded, as a tes mony
to them."
5 Now when Jesus had entered
Capernaum, a centurion came to Him,
pleading with Him,
6 saying, "Lord, my servant is lying at
home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented."
7 And Jesus said to him, "I will come
and heal him."
8 The centurion answered and said,
"Lord, I am not worthy that You shouldMATTHEW 8
35
come under my roof. But only speak a
word, and my servant will be healed.
9 "For I also am a man under authority,
having soldiers under me. And I say
to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to
another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to
my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it."
10 When Jesus heard it, He marveled,
and said to those who followed,
"Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found
such great faith, not even in Israel!
11 "And I say to you that many will
come from east and west, and sit down
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
kingdom of heaven.
12 "But the sons of the kingdom will be
cast out into outer darkness. There will
be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go
your way; and as you have believed, so
let it be done for you." And his servant
was healed that same hour.MATTHEW 8
36
14 Now when Jesus had come into
Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother
lying sick with a fever.
15 So He touched her hand, and the
fever le her. And she arose and served
them.
16 When evening had come, they
brought to Him many who were demon–
possessed. And He cast out the spirits
with a word, and healed all who were
sick,
17 that it might be fulﬁlled which was
spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
"He Himself took our inﬁrmi es And
bore our sicknesses."
18 And when Jesus saw great mul tudes
about Him, He gave a command to
depart to the other side.
19 Then a certain scribe came and
said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You
wherever You go."MATTHEW 8
37
20 And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have
holes and birds of the air have nests, but
the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His
head."
21 Then another of His disciples said to
Him, "Lord, let me ﬁrst go and bury my
father."
22 But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me,
and let the dead bury their own dead."
23 Now when He got into a boat, His
disciples followed Him.
24 And suddenly a great tempest arose
on the sea, so that the boat was covered
with the waves. But He was asleep.
25 Then His disciples came to Him and
awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We
are perishing!"
26 But He said to them, "Why are you
fearful, O you of li le faith?" Then He
arose and rebuked the winds and the
sea, and there was a great calm.MATTHEW 8
38
27 So the men marveled, saying, "Who
can this be, that even the winds and the
sea obey Him?"
28 When He had come to the other side,
to the country of the Gergesenes, there
met Him two demon–possessed men,
coming out of the tombs, exceedingly
ﬁerce, so that no one could pass that
way.
29 And suddenly they cried out, saying,
"What have we to do with You, Jesus,
You Son of God? Have You come here to
torment us before the me?"
30 Now a good way oﬀ from them there
was a herd of many swine feeding.
31 So the demons begged Him, saying,
"If You cast us out, permit us to go away
into the herd of swine."
32 And He said to them, "Go." So when
they had come out, they went into the
herd of swine. And suddenly the whole
herd of swine ran violently down theMATTHEW 8 – 9
39
steep place into the sea, and perished in
the water.
33 Then those who kept them ﬂed;
and they went away into the city and
told everything, including what had
happened to the demon–possessed
men.
34 And behold, the whole city came out
to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him,
they begged Him to depart from their
region.
1 So He got into a boat, crossed over,
and came to His own city.
2 Then behold, they brought to Him a
paraly c lying on a bed. When Jesus saw
their faith, He said to the paraly c, "Son,
be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven
you."
3 And at once some of the scribes
said within themselves, "This Man
blasphemes!"
9MATTHEW 9
40
4 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts,
said, "Why do you think evil in your
hearts?
5 "For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins
are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and
walk’?
6 "But that you may know that the Son
of Man has power on earth to forgive
sins" ––then He said to the paraly c,
"Arise, take up your bed, and go to your
house."
7 And he arose and departed to his
house.
8 Now when the mul tudes saw it, they
marveled and gloriﬁed God, who had
given such power to men.
9 As Jesus passed on from there, He saw
a man named Ma hew si ng at the tax
oﬃce. And He said to him, "Follow Me."
So he arose and followed Him.
10 Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the
table in the house, that behold, manyMATTHEW 9
41
tax collectors and sinners came and sat
down with Him and His disciples.
11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they
said to His disciples, "Why does your
Teacher eat with tax collectors and
sinners?"
12 When Jesus heard that, He said to
them, "Those who are well have no need
of a physician, but those who are sick.
13 "But go and learn what this means:
‘I desire mercy and not sacriﬁce.’ For I
did not come to call the righteous, but
sinners, to repentance."
14 Then the disciples of John came
to Him, saying, "Why do we and the
Pharisees fast o en, but Your disciples
do not fast?"
15 And Jesus said to them, "Can the
friends of the bridegroom mourn as long
as the bridegroom is with them? But the
days will come when the bridegroomMATTHEW 9
42
will be taken away from them, and then
they will fast.
16 "No one puts a piece of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment; for the patch
pulls away from the garment, and the
tear is made worse.
17 "Nor do they put new wine into old
wineskins, or else the wineskins break,
the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are
ruined. But they put new wine into new
wineskins, and both are preserved."
18 While He spoke these things to them,
behold, a ruler came and worshiped
Him, saying, "My daughter has just died,
but come and lay Your hand on her and
she will live."
19 So Jesus arose and followed him, and
so did His disciples.
20 And suddenly, a woman who had
a ﬂow of blood for twelve years came
from behind and touched the hem of His
garment.MATTHEW 9
43
21 For she said to herself, "If only I may
touch His garment, I shall be made well."
22 But Jesus turned around, and when
He saw her He said, "Be of good cheer,
daughter; your faith has made you well."
And the woman was made well from
that hour.
23 When Jesus came into the ruler’s
house, and saw the ﬂute players and the
noisy crowd wailing,
24 He said to them, "Make room, for the
girl is not dead, but sleeping." And they
ridiculed Him.
25 But when the crowd was put outside,
He went in and took her by the hand,
and the girl arose.
26 And the report of this went out into
all that land.
27 When Jesus departed from there,
two blind men followed Him, crying out
and saying, "Son of David, have mercy
on us!"MATTHEW 9
44
28 And when He had come into the
house, the blind men came to Him. And
Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that
I am able to do this?" They said to Him,
"Yes, Lord."
29 Then He touched their eyes, saying,
"According to your faith let it be to you."
30 And their eyes were opened. And
Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See
that no one knows it."
31 But when they had departed, they
spread the news about Him in all that
country.
32 As they went out, behold, they
brought to Him a man, mute and
demon–possessed.
33 And when the demon was cast out,
the mute spoke. And the mul tudes
marveled, saying, "It was never seen like
this in Israel!"
34 But the Pharisees said, "He casts out
demons by the ruler of the demons."MATTHEW 9 – 10
45
35 Then Jesus went about all the
ci es and villages, teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the gospel of the
kingdom, and healing every sickness and
every disease among the people.
36 But when He saw the mul tudes, He
was moved with compassion for them,
because they were weary and sca ered,
like sheep having no shepherd.
37 Then He said to His disciples, "The
harvest truly is plen ful, but the laborers
are few.
38 "Therefore pray the Lord of the
harvest to send out laborers into His
harvest."
1 And when He had called His
twelve disciples to Him, He gave
them power over unclean spirits, to
cast them out, and to heal all kinds of
sickness and all kinds of disease.
2 Now the names of the twelve apostles
are these: ﬁrst, Simon, who is called
10MATTHEW 10
46
Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and
Ma hew the tax collector; James the
son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose
surname was Thaddaeus;
4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas
Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
5 These twelve Jesus sent out and
commanded them, saying: "Do not go
into the way of the Gen les, and do not
enter a city of the Samaritans.
6 "But go rather to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.
7 "And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The
kingdom of heaven is at hand.’
8 "Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely
you have received, freely give.
9 "Provide neither gold nor silver nor
copper in your money belts,MATTHEW 10
47
10 "nor bag for your journey, nor two
tunics, nor sandals, nor staﬀs; for a
worker is worthy of his food.
11 "Now whatever city or town you
enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and
stay there ll you go out.
12 "And when you go into a household,
greet it.
13 "If the household is worthy, let your
peace come upon it. But if it is not
worthy, let your peace return to you.
14 "And whoever will not receive you
nor hear your words, when you depart
from that house or city, shake oﬀ the
dust from your feet.
15 "Assuredly, I say to you, it will be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom
and Gomorrah in the day of judgment
than for that city!
16 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in
the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise
as serpents and harmless as doves.MATTHEW 10
48
17 "But beware of men, for they will
deliver you up to councils and scourge
you in their synagogues.
18 "You will be brought before governors
and kings for My sake, as a tes mony to
them and to the Gen les.
19 "But when they deliver you up, do
not worry about how or what you should
speak. For it will be given to you in that
hour what you should speak;
20 "for it is not you who speak, but the
Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
21 "Now brother will deliver up brother
to death, and a father his child; and
children will rise up against parents and
cause them to be put to death.
22 "And you will be hated by all for My
name’s sake. But he who endures to the
end will be saved.
23 "When they persecute you in this
city, ﬂee to another. For assuredly, I say
to you, you will not have gone throughMATTHEW 10
49
the ci es of Israel before the Son of Man
comes.
24 "A disciple is not above his teacher,
nor a servant above his master.
25 "It is enough for a disciple that he be
like his teacher, and a servant like his
master. If they have called the master of
the house Beelzebub, how much more
will they call those of his household!
26 "Therefore do not fear them. For
there is nothing covered that will not be
revealed, and hidden that will not be
known.
27 "Whatever I tell you in the dark,
speak in the light; and what you hear in
the ear, preach on the housetops.
28 "And do not fear those who kill the
body but cannot kill the soul. But rather
fear Him who is able to destroy both soul
and body in hell.
29 "Are not two sparrows sold for a
copper coin? And not one of them fallsMATTHEW 10
50
to the ground apart from your Father’s
will.
30 "But the very hairs of your head are
all numbered.
31 "Do not fear therefore; you are of
more value than many sparrows.
32 "Therefore whoever confesses Me
before men, him I will also confess
before My Father who is in heaven.
33 "But whoever denies Me before men,
him I will also deny before My Father
who is in heaven.
34 "Do not think that I came to bring
peace on earth. I did not come to bring
peace but a sword.
35 "For I have come to ‘set a man
against his father, a daughter against her
mother, and a daughter–in–law against
her mother–in–law’;
36 "and ‘a man’s enemies will be those
of his own household.’MATTHEW 10
51
37 "He who loves father or mother more
than Me is not worthy of Me. And he
who loves son or daughter more than
Me is not worthy of Me.
38 "And he who does not take his cross
and follow a er Me is not worthy of Me.
39 "He who ﬁnds his life will lose it, and
he who loses his life for My sake will ﬁnd
it.
40 "He who receives you receives Me,
and he who receives Me receives Him
who sent Me.
41 "He who receives a prophet in
the name of a prophet shall receive a
prophet’s reward. And he who receives
a righteous man in the name of a
righteous man shall receive a righteous
man’s reward.
42 "And whoever gives one of these
li le ones only a cup of cold water in
the name of a disciple, assuredly, I sayMATTHEW 11
52
to you, he shall by no means lose his
reward."
1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus
ﬁnished commanding His twelve
disciples, that He departed from there to
teach and to preach in their ci es.
2 And when John had heard in prison
about the works of Christ, he sent two of
his disciples
3 and said to Him, "Are You the Coming
One, or do we look for another?"
4 Jesus answered and said to them, "Go
and tell John the things which you hear
and see:
5 "The blind see and the lame walk; the
lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear;
the dead are raised up and the poor
have the gospel preached to them.
6 "And blessed is he who is not oﬀended
because of Me."
7 As they departed, Jesus began to
say to the mul tudes concerning John:
11MATTHEW 11
53
"What did you go out into the wilderness
to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
8 "But what did you go out to see? A
man clothed in so garments? Indeed,
those who wear so clothing are in
kings’ houses.
9 "But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more
than a prophet.
10 "For this is he of whom it is wri en:
‘Behold, I send My messenger before
Your face, Who will prepare Your way
before You.’
11 "Assuredly, I say to you, among those
born of women there has not risen one
greater than John the Bap st; but he
who is least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than he.
12 "And from the days of John the
Bap st un l now the kingdom of heaven
suﬀers violence, and the violent take it
by force.MATTHEW 11
54
13 "For all the prophets and the law
prophesied un l John.
14 "And if you are willing to receive it,
he is Elijah who is to come.
15 "He who has ears to hear, let him
hear!
16 "But to what shall I liken this
genera on? It is like children si ng in
the marketplaces and calling to their
companions,
17 "and saying: ‘We played the ﬂute
for you, And you did not dance; We
mourned to you, And you did not
lament.’
18 "For John came neither ea ng nor
drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
19 "The Son of Man came ea ng
and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a
glu on and a winebibber, a friend of tax
collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is
jus ﬁed by her children."MATTHEW 11
20 Then He began to rebuke the ci
55
es
in which most of His mighty works had
been done, because they did not repent:
21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which
were done in you had been done in Tyre
and Sidon, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
22 "But I say to you, it will be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of
judgment than for you.
23 "And you, Capernaum, who are
exalted to heaven, will be brought down
to Hades; for if the mighty works which
were done in you had been done in
Sodom, it would have remained un l
this day.
24 "But I say to you that it shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the
day of judgment than for you."
25 At that me Jesus answered and said,
"I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven andMATTHEW 11 – 12
56
earth, that You have hidden these things
from the wise and prudent and have
revealed them to babes.
26 "Even so, Father, for so it seemed
good in Your sight.
27 "All things have been delivered to
Me by My Father, and no one knows the
Son except the Father. Nor does anyone
know the Father except the Son, and the
one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
28 "Come to Me, all you who labor and
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
29 "Take My yoke upon you and learn
from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in
heart, and you will ﬁnd rest for your
souls.
30 "For My yoke is easy and My burden
is light."
1 At that me Jesus went through
the grainﬁelds on the Sabbath.
And His disciples were hungry, and
began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
12MATTHEW 12
57
2 And when the Pharisees saw it, they
said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are
doing what is not lawful to do on the
Sabbath!"
3 But He said to them, "Have you
not read what David did when he was
hungry, he and those who were with
him:
4 "how he entered the house of God
and ate the showbread which was not
lawful for him to eat, nor for those who
were with him, but only for the priests?
5 "Or have you not read in the law that
on the Sabbath the priests in the temple
profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?
6 "Yet I say to you that in this place
there is One greater than the temple.
7 "But if you had known what this
means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacriﬁce,’
you would not have condemned the
guiltless.MATTHEW 12
58
8 "For the Son of Man is Lord even of
the Sabbath."
9 Now when He had departed from
there, He went into their synagogue.
10 And behold, there was a man who
had a withered hand. And they asked
Him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath?" ––that they might accuse
Him.
11 Then He said to them, "What man is
there among you who has one sheep,
and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath,
will not lay hold of it and li it out?
12 "Of how much more value then is a
man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful
to do good on the Sabbath."
13 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out
your hand." And he stretched it out, and
it was restored as whole as the other.
14 Then the Pharisees went out and
plo ed against Him, how they might
destroy Him.MATTHEW 12
59
15 But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew
from there. And great mul tudes
followed Him, and He healed them all.
16 Yet He warned them not to make
Him known,
17 that it might be fulﬁlled which was
spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
18 "Behold! My Servant whom I have
chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is
well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon
Him, And He will declare jus ce to the
Gen les.
19 He will not quarrel nor cry out, Nor
will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
20 A bruised reed He will not break, And
smoking ﬂax He will not quench, Till He
sends forth jus ce to victory;
21 And in His name Gen les will trust."
22 Then one was brought to Him who
was demon–possessed, blind and mute;
and He healed him, so that the blind and
mute man both spoke and saw.MATTHEW 12
23 And all the mul
60
tudes were amazed
and said, "Could this be the Son of
David?"
24 Now when the Pharisees heard it
they said, "This fellow does not cast out
demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler
of the demons."
25 But Jesus knew their thoughts, and
said to them: "Every kingdom divided
against itself is brought to desola on,
and every city or house divided against
itself will not stand.
26 "If Satan casts out Satan, he is
divided against himself. How then will
his kingdom stand?
27 "And if I cast out demons by
Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast
them out? Therefore they shall be your
judges.
28 "But if I cast out demons by the Spirit
of God, surely the kingdom of God has
come upon you.MATTHEW 12
61
29 "Or how can one enter a strong man’s
house and plunder his goods, unless he
ﬁrst binds the strong man? And then he
will plunder his house.
30 "He who is not with Me is against
Me, and he who does not gather with
Me sca ers abroad.
31 "Therefore I say to you, every sin and
blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the
blasphemy against the Spirit will not be
forgiven men.
32 "Anyone who speaks a word against
the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him;
but whoever speaks against the Holy
Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either
in this age or in the age to come.
33 "Either make the tree good and its
fruit good, or else make the tree bad
and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by
its fruit.
34 "Brood of vipers! How can you, being
evil, speak good things? For out of theMATTHEW 12
62
abundance of the heart the mouth
speaks.
35 "A good man out of the good treasure
of his heart brings forth good things,
and an evil man out of the evil treasure
brings forth evil things.
36 "But I say to you that for every idle
word men may speak, they will give
account of it in the day of judgment.
37 "For by your words you will be
jus ﬁed, and by your words you will be
condemned."
38 Then some of the scribes and
Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher,
we want to see a sign from You."
39 But He answered and said to them,
"An evil and adulterous genera on seeks
a er a sign, and no sign will be given to
it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40 "For as Jonah was three days and
three nights in the belly of the great ﬁsh,MATTHEW 12
63
so will the Son of Man be three days and
three nights in the heart of the earth.
41 "The men of Nineveh will rise up in
the judgment with this genera on and
condemn it, because they repented at
the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a
greater than Jonah is here.
42 "The queen of the South will rise up
in the judgment with this genera on
and condemn it, for she came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom
of Solomon; and indeed a greater than
Solomon is here.
43 "When an unclean spirit goes out
of a man, he goes through dry places,
seeking rest, and ﬁnds none.
44 "Then he says, ‘I will return to my
house from which I came.’ And when he
comes, he ﬁnds it empty, swept, and put
in order.
45 "Then he goes and takes with him
seven other spirits more wicked thanMATTHEW 12 – 13
64
himself, and they enter and dwell there;
and the last state of that man is worse
than the ﬁrst. So shall it also be with this
wicked genera on."
46 While He was s ll talking to the
mul tudes, behold, His mother and
brothers stood outside, seeking to speak
with Him.
47 Then one said to Him, "Look, Your
mother and Your brothers are standing
outside, seeking to speak with You."
48 But He answered and said to the one
who told Him, "Who is My mother and
who are My brothers?"
49 And He stretched out His hand
toward His disciples and said, "Here are
My mother and My brothers!
50 "For whoever does the will of My
Father in heaven is My brother and sister
and mother."
1 On the same day Jesus went out
of the house and sat by the sea.
13MATTHEW 13
2 And great mul
65
tudes were gathered
together to Him, so that He got into a
boat and sat; and the whole mul tude
stood on the shore.
3 Then He spoke many things to them in
parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went
out to sow.
4 "And as he sowed, some seed fell by
the wayside; and the birds came and
devoured them.
5 "Some fell on stony places, where
they did not have much earth; and they
immediately sprang up because they
had no depth of earth.
6 "But when the sun was up they were
scorched, and because they had no root
they withered away.
7 "And some fell among thorns, and the
thorns sprang up and choked them.
8 "But others fell on good ground and
yielded a crop: some a hundredfold,
some sixty, some thirty.MATTHEW 13
66
9 "He who has ears to hear, let him
hear!"
10 And the disciples came and said to
Him, "Why do You speak to them in
parables?"
11 He answered and said to them,
"Because it has been given to you to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to them it has not been
given.
12 "For whoever has, to him more will
be given, and he will have abundance;
but whoever does not have, even what
he has will be taken away from him.
13 "Therefore I speak to them in
parables, because seeing they do not
see, and hearing they do not hear, nor
do they understand.
14 "And in them the prophecy of Isaiah
is fulﬁlled, which says: ‘Hearing you
will hear and shall not understand, And
seeing you will see and not perceive;MATTHEW 13
67
15 For the hearts of this people have
grown dull. Their ears are hard of
hearing, And their eyes they have closed,
Lest they should see with their eyes and
hear with their ears, Lest they should
understand with their hearts and turn,
So that I should heal them.’
16 "But blessed are your eyes for they
see, and your ears for they hear;
17 "for assuredly, I say to you that many
prophets and righteous men desired to
see what you see, and did not see it, and
to hear what you hear, and did not hear
it.
18 "Therefore hear the parable of the
sower:
19 "When anyone hears the word of the
kingdom, and does not understand it,
then the wicked one comes and snatches
away what was sown in his heart. This is
he who received seed by the wayside.MATTHEW 13
68
20 "But he who received the seed on
stony places, this is he who hears the
word and immediately receives it with
joy;
21 "yet he has no root in himself, but
endures only for a while. For when
tribula on or persecu on arises because
of the word, immediately he stumbles.
22 "Now he who received seed among
the thorns is he who hears the word,
and the cares of this world and the
decei ulness of riches choke the word,
and he becomes unfrui ul.
23 "But he who received seed on the
good ground is he who hears the word
and understands it, who indeed bears
fruit and produces: some a hundredfold,
some sixty, some thirty."
24 Another parable He put forth to
them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is
like a man who sowed good seed in his
ﬁeld;MATTHEW 13
69
25 "but while men slept, his enemy
came and sowed tares among the wheat
and went his way.
26 "But when the grain had sprouted
and produced a crop, then the tares also
appeared.
27 "So the servants of the owner came
and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow
good seed in your ﬁeld? How then does
it have tares?’
28 "He said to them, ‘An enemy has
done this.’ The servants said to him, ‘Do
you want us then to go and gather them
up?’
29 "But he said, ‘No, lest while you
gather up the tares you also uproot the
wheat with them.
30 ‘Let both grow together un l the
harvest, and at the me of harvest I will
say to the reapers, "First gather together
the tares and bind them in bundles toMATTHEW 13
70
burn them, but gather the wheat into
my barn."’"
31 Another parable He put forth to
them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is
like a mustard seed, which a man took
and sowed in his ﬁeld,
32 "which indeed is the least of all the
seeds; but when it is grown it is greater
than the herbs and becomes a tree, so
that the birds of the air come and nest in
its branches."
33 Another parable He spoke to them:
"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,
which a woman took and hid in three
measures of meal ll it was all leavened."
34 All these things Jesus spoke to the
mul tude in parables; and without a
parable He did not speak to them,
35 that it might be fulﬁlled which was
spoken by the prophet, saying: "I will
open My mouth in parables; I will u erMATTHEW 13
71
things kept secret from the founda on
of the world."
36 Then Jesus sent the mul tude away
and went into the house. And His
disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain
to us the parable of the tares of the
ﬁeld."
37 He answered and said to them: "He
who sows the good seed is the Son of
Man.
38 "The ﬁeld is the world, the good
seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but
the tares are the sons of the wicked one.
39 "The enemy who sowed them is the
devil, the harvest is the end of the age,
and the reapers are the angels.
40 "Therefore as the tares are gathered
and burned in the ﬁre, so it will be at the
end of this age.
41 "The Son of Man will send out His
angels, and they will gather out of HisMATTHEW 13
72
kingdom all things that oﬀend, and those
who prac ce lawlessness,
42 "and will cast them into the furnace
of ﬁre. There will be wailing and gnashing
of teeth.
43 "Then the righteous will shine forth
as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
44 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
treasure hidden in a ﬁeld, which a man
found and hid; and for joy over it he goes
and sells all that he has and buys that
ﬁeld.
45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
a merchant seeking beau ful pearls,
46 "who, when he had found one pearl
of great price, went and sold all that he
had and bought it.
47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
a dragnet that was cast into the sea and
gathered some of every kind,MATTHEW 13
73
48 "which, when it was full, they drew to
shore; and they sat down and gathered
the good into vessels, but threw the bad
away.
49 "So it will be at the end of the age.
The angels will come forth, separate the
wicked from among the just,
50 "and cast them into the furnace of
ﬁre. There will be wailing and gnashing
of teeth."
51 Jesus said to them, "Have you
understood all these things?" They said
to Him, "Yes, Lord."
52 Then He said to them, "Therefore
every scribe instructed concerning the
kingdom of heaven is like a householder
who brings out of his treasure things
new and old."
53 Now it came to pass, when Jesus
had ﬁnished these parables, that He
departed from there.MATTHEW 13 – 14
74
54 And when He had come to His
own country, He taught them in their
synagogue, so that they were astonished
and said, "Where did this Man get this
wisdom and these mighty works?
55 "Is this not the carpenter’s son?
Is not His mother called Mary? And
His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and
Judas?
56 "And His sisters, are they not all with
us? Where then did this Man get all
these things?"
57 So they were oﬀended at Him. But
Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not
without honor except in his own country
and in his own house."
58 Now He did not do many mighty
works there because of their unbelief.
1 At that me Herod the tetrarch
heard the report about Jesus
2 and said to his servants, "This is John
the Bap st; he is risen from the dead,
14MATTHEW 14
75
and therefore these powers are at work
in him."
3 For Herod had laid hold of John and
bound him, and put him in prison for
the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s
wife.
4 Because John had said to him, "It is
not lawful for you to have her."
5 And although he wanted to put him to
death, he feared the mul tude, because
they counted him as a prophet.
6 But when Herod’s birthday was
celebrated, the daughter of Herodias
danced before them and pleased Herod.
7 Therefore he promised with an oath
to give her whatever she might ask.
8 So she, having been prompted by her
mother, said, "Give me John the Bap st’s
head here on a pla er."
9 And the king was sorry; nevertheless,
because of the oaths and because ofMATTHEW 14
76
those who sat with him, he commanded
it to be given to her.
10 So he sent and had John beheaded in
prison.
11 And his head was brought on a
pla er and given to the girl, and she
brought it to her mother.
12 Then his disciples came and took
away the body and buried it, and went
and told Jesus.
13 When Jesus heard it, He departed
from there by boat to a deserted place
by Himself. But when the mul tudes
heard it, they followed Him on foot from
the ci es.
14 And when Jesus went out He saw a
great mul tude; and He was moved with
compassion for them, and healed their
sick.
15 When it was evening, His disciples
came to Him, saying, "This is a deserted
place, and the hour is already late. SendMATTHEW 14
77
the mul tudes away, that they may go
into the villages and buy themselves
food."
16 But Jesus said to them, "They do
not need to go away. You give them
something to eat."
17 And they said to Him, "We have here
only ﬁve loaves and two ﬁsh."
18 He said, "Bring them here to Me."
19 Then He commanded the mul tudes
to sit down on the grass. And He took the
ﬁve loaves and the two ﬁsh, and looking
up to heaven, He blessed and broke and
gave the loaves to the disciples; and the
disciples gave to the mul tudes.
20 So they all ate and were ﬁlled, and
they took up twelve baskets full of the
fragments that remained.
21 Now those who had eaten were
about ﬁve thousand men, besides
women and children.MATTHEW 14
78
22 Immediately Jesus made His disciples
get into the boat and go before Him
to the other side, while He sent the
mul tudes away.
23 And when He had sent the mul tudes
away, He went up on the mountain by
Himself to pray. Now when evening
came, He was alone there.
24 But the boat was now in the middle
of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the
wind was contrary.
25 Now in the fourth watch of the night
Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
26 And when the disciples saw Him
walking on the sea, they were troubled,
saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out
for fear.
27 But immediately Jesus spoke to
them, saying, "Be of good cheer! It is I;
do not be afraid."MATTHEW 14
79
28 And Peter answered Him and said,
"Lord, if it is You, command me to come
to You on the water."
29 So He said, "Come." And when Peter
had come down out of the boat, he
walked on the water to go to Jesus.
30 But when he saw that the wind was
boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning
to sink he cried out, saying, "Lord, save
me!"
31 And immediately Jesus stretched out
His hand and caught him, and said to
him, "O you of li le faith, why did you
doubt?"
32 And when they got into the boat, the
wind ceased.
33 Then those who were in the boat
came and worshiped Him, saying, "Truly
You are the Son of God."
34 When they had crossed over, they
came to the land of Gennesaret.MATTHEW 14 – 15
80
35 And when the men of that place
recognized Him, they sent out into all
that surrounding region, brought to Him
all who were sick,
36 and begged Him that they might only
touch the hem of His garment. And as
many as touched it were made perfectly
well.
1 Then the scribes and Pharisees
who were from Jerusalem came
to Jesus, saying,
2 "Why do Your disciples transgress the
tradi on of the elders? For they do not
wash their hands when they eat bread."
3 He answered and said to them,
"Why do you also transgress the
commandment of God because of your
tradi on?
4 "For God commanded, saying, ‘Honor
your father and your mother’; and, ‘He
who curses father or mother, let him be
put to death.’
15MATTHEW 15
81
5 "But you say, ‘Whoever says to his
father or mother, "Whatever proﬁt you
might have received from me is a gi to
God" ––
6 ‘then he need not honor his father
or mother.’ Thus you have made the
commandment of God of no eﬀect by
your tradi on.
7 "Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy
about you, saying:
8 ‘These people draw near to Me with
their mouth, And honor Me with their
lips, But their heart is far from Me.
9 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching
as doctrines the commandments of
men.’"
10 When He had called the mul tude
to Himself, He said to them, "Hear and
understand:
11 "Not what goes into the mouth
deﬁles a man; but what comes out of
the mouth, this deﬁles a man."MATTHEW 15
82
12 Then His disciples came and said to
Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees
were oﬀended when they heard this
saying?"
13 But He answered and said, "Every
plant which My heavenly Father has not
planted will be uprooted.
14 "Let them alone. They are blind
leaders of the blind. And if the blind
leads the blind, both will fall into a
ditch."
15 Then Peter answered and said to
Him, "Explain this parable to us."
16 So Jesus said, "Are you also s ll
without understanding?
17 "Do you not yet understand that
whatever enters the mouth goes into
the stomach and is eliminated?
18 "But those things which proceed out
of the mouth come from the heart, and
they deﬁle a man.MATTHEW 15
83
19 "For out of the heart proceed
evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
fornica ons, the s, false witness,
blasphemies.
20 "These are the things which deﬁle a
man, but to eat with unwashed hands
does not deﬁle a man."
21 Then Jesus went out from there and
departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
22 And behold, a woman of Canaan
came from that region and cried out to
Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord,
Son of David! My daughter is severely
demon–possessed."
23 But He answered her not a word.
And His disciples came and urged Him,
saying, "Send her away, for she cries out
a er us."
24 But He answered and said, "I was
not sent except to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel."MATTHEW 15
84
25 Then she came and worshiped Him,
saying, "Lord, help me!"
26 But He answered and said, "It is not
good to take the children’s bread and
throw it to the li le dogs."
27 And she said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the
li le dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
their masters’ table."
28 Then Jesus answered and said to her,
"O woman, great is your faith! Let it be
to you as you desire." And her daughter
was healed from that very hour.
29 Jesus departed from there, skirted
the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the
mountain and sat down there.
30 Then great mul tudes came to Him,
having with them the lame, blind, mute,
maimed, and many others; and they laid
them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed
them.
31 So the mul tude marveled when
they saw the mute speaking, the maimedMATTHEW 15
85
made whole, the lame walking, and the
blind seeing; and they gloriﬁed the God
of Israel.
32 Now Jesus called His disciples to
Himself and said, "I have compassion on
the mul tude, because they have now
con nued with Me three days and have
nothing to eat. And I do not want to
send them away hungry, lest they faint
on the way."
33 Then His disciples said to Him,
"Where could we get enough bread
in the wilderness to ﬁll such a great
mul tude?"
34 Jesus said to them, "How many
loaves do you have?" And they said,
"Seven, and a few li le ﬁsh."
35 So He commanded the mul tude to
sit down on the ground.
36 And He took the seven loaves and
the ﬁsh and gave thanks, broke themMATTHEW 15 – 16
86
and gave them to His disciples; and the
disciples gave to the mul tude.
37 So they all ate and were ﬁlled, and
they took up seven large baskets full of
the fragments that were le .
38 Now those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and
children.
39 And He sent away the mul tude, got
into the boat, and came to the region of
Magdala.
1 Then the Pharisees and
Sadducees came, and tes ng Him
asked that He would show them a sign
from heaven.
2 He answered and said to them, "When
it is evening you say, ‘It will be fair
weather, for the sky is red’;
3 "and in the morning, ‘It will be foul
weather today, for the sky is red and
threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how
16MATTHEW 16
87
to discern the face of the sky, but you
cannot discern the signs of the mes.
4 "A wicked and adulterous genera on
seeks a er a sign, and no sign shall be
given to it except the sign of the prophet
Jonah." And He le them and departed.
5 Now when His disciples had come to
the other side, they had forgo en to
take bread.
6 Then Jesus said to them, "Take
heed and beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and the Sadducees."
7 And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, "It is because
we have taken no bread."
8 But Jesus, being aware of it, said to
them, "O you of li le faith, why do you
reason among yourselves because you
have brought no bread?
9 "Do you not yet understand, or
remember the ﬁve loaves of the ﬁveMATTHEW 16
88
thousand and how many baskets you
took up?
10 "Nor the seven loaves of the four
thousand and how many large baskets
you took up?
11 "How is it you do not understand
that I did not speak to you concerning
bread? ––but to beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and Sadducees."
12 Then they understood that He did
not tell them to beware of the leaven
of bread, but of the doctrine of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.
13 When Jesus came into the region of
Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples,
saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son
of Man, am?"
14 So they said, "Some say John the
Bap st, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah
or one of the prophets."
15 He said to them, "But who do you say
that I am?"MATTHEW 16
89
16 Simon Peter answered and said, "You
are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
17 Jesus answered and said to him,
"Blessed are you, Simon Bar–Jonah, for
ﬂesh and blood has not revealed this to
you, but My Father who is in heaven.
18 "And I also say to you that you are
Peter, and on this rock I will build My
church, and the gates of Hades shall not
prevail against it.
19 "And I will give you the keys of the
kingdom of heaven, and whatever you
bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
and whatever you loose on earth will be
loosed in heaven."
20 Then He commanded His disciples
that they should tell no one that He was
Jesus the Christ.
21 From that me Jesus began to show
to His disciples that He must go to
Jerusalem, and suﬀer many things from
the elders and chief priests and scribes,MATTHEW 16
90
and be killed, and be raised the third
day.
22 Then Peter took Him aside and began
to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from
You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!"
23 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get
behind Me, Satan! You are an oﬀense to
Me, for you are not mindful of the things
of God, but the things of men."
24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If
anyone desires to come a er Me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross,
and follow Me.
25 "For whoever desires to save his life
will lose it, but whoever loses his life for
My sake will ﬁnd it.
26 "For what proﬁt is it to a man if he
gains the whole world, and loses his
own soul? Or what will a man give in
exchange for his soul?
27 "For the Son of Man will come in the
glory of His Father with His angels, andMATTHEW 16 – 17
91
then He will reward each according to
his works.
28 "Assuredly, I say to you, there are
some standing here who shall not taste
death ll they see the Son of Man
coming in His kingdom."
1 Now a er six days Jesus took
Peter, James, and John his
brother, led them up on a high mountain
by themselves;
2 and He was transﬁgured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and His
clothes became as white as the light.
3 And behold, Moses and Elijah
appeared to them, talking with Him.
4 Then Peter answered and said to
Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be
here; if You wish, let us make here three
tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses,
and one for Elijah."
5 While he was s ll speaking, behold, a
bright cloud overshadowed them; and
17MATTHEW 17
92
suddenly a voice came out of the cloud,
saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased. Hear Him!"
6 And when the disciples heard it, they
fell on their faces and were greatly
afraid.
7 But Jesus came and touched them
and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
8 When they had li ed up their eyes,
they saw no one but Jesus only.
9 Now as they came down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them,
saying, "Tell the vision to no one un l
the Son of Man is risen from the dead."
10 And His disciples asked Him, saying,
"Why then do the scribes say that Elijah
must come ﬁrst?"
11 Jesus answered and said to them,
"Indeed, Elijah is coming ﬁrst and will
restore all things.
12 "But I say to you that Elijah has come
already, and they did not know himMATTHEW 17
93
but did to him whatever they wished.
Likewise the Son of Man is also about to
suﬀer at their hands."
13 Then the disciples understood that
He spoke to them of John the Bap st.
14 And when they had come to the
mul tude, a man came to Him, kneeling
down to Him and saying,
15 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he
is an epilep c and suﬀers severely; for
he o en falls into the ﬁre and o en into
the water.
16 "So I brought him to Your disciples,
but they could not cure him."
17 Then Jesus answered and said, "O
faithless and perverse genera on, how
long shall I be with you? How long shall I
bear with you? Bring him here to Me."
18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and
it came out of him; and the child was
cured from that very hour.MATTHEW 17
94
19 Then the disciples came to Jesus
privately and said, "Why could we not
cast it out?"
20 So Jesus said to them, "Because of
your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you,
if you have faith as a mustard seed, you
will say to this mountain, ‘Move from
here to there,’ and it will move; and
nothing will be impossible for you.
21 "However, this kind does not go out
except by prayer and fas ng."
22 Now while they were staying in
Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of
Man is about to be betrayed into the
hands of men,
23 "and they will kill Him, and the third
day He will be raised up." And they were
exceedingly sorrowful.
24 When they had come to Capernaum,
those who received the temple tax came
to Peter and said, "Does your Teacher
not pay the temple tax?"MATTHEW 17 – 18
95
25 He said, "Yes." And when he had
come into the house, Jesus an cipated
him, saying, "What do you think, Simon?
From whom do the kings of the earth
take customs or taxes, from their sons or
from strangers?"
26 Peter said to Him, "From strangers."
Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are
free.
27 "Nevertheless, lest we oﬀend them,
go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take
the ﬁsh that comes up ﬁrst. And when
you have opened its mouth, you will ﬁnd
a piece of money; take that and give it to
them for Me and you."
1 At that me the disciples came
to Jesus, saying, "Who then is
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
2 Then Jesus called a li le child to Him,
set him in the midst of them,
3 and said, "Assuredly, I say to you,
unless you are converted and become
18MATTHEW 18
96
as li le children, you will by no means
enter the kingdom of heaven.
4 "Therefore whoever humbles himself
as this li le child is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven.
5 "Whoever receives one li le child like
this in My name receives Me.
6 "But whoever causes one of these
li le ones who believe in Me to sin, it
would be be er for him if a millstone
were hung around his neck, and he were
drowned in the depth of the sea.
7 "Woe to the world because of
oﬀenses! For oﬀenses must come, but
woe to that man by whom the oﬀense
comes!
8 "If your hand or foot causes you to
sin, cut it oﬀ and cast it from you. It is
be er for you to enter into life lame
or maimed, rather than having two
hands or two feet, to be cast into the
everlas ng ﬁre.MATTHEW 18
97
9 "And if your eye causes you to sin,
pluck it out and cast it from you. It is
be er for you to enter into life with one
eye, rather than having two eyes, to be
cast into hell ﬁre.
10 "Take heed that you do not despise
one of these li le ones, for I say to you
that in heaven their angels always see
the face of My Father who is in heaven.
11 "For the Son of Man has come to
save that which was lost.
12 "What do you think? If a man has a
hundred sheep, and one of them goes
astray, does he not leave the ninety–nine
and go to the mountains to seek the one
that is straying?
13 "And if he should ﬁnd it, assuredly, I
say to you, he rejoices more over that
sheep than over the ninety–nine that
did not go astray.MATTHEW 18
98
14 "Even so it is not the will of your
Father who is in heaven that one of
these li le ones should perish.
15 "Moreover if your brother sins
against you, go and tell him his fault
between you and him alone. If he hears
you, you have gained your brother.
16 "But if he will not hear, take with you
one or two more, that ‘by the mouth of
two or three witnesses every word may
be established.’
17 "And if he refuses to hear them, tell
it to the church. But if he refuses even to
hear the church, let him be to you like a
heathen and a tax collector.
18 "Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you
bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
and whatever you loose on earth will be
loosed in heaven.
19 "Again I say to you that if two of you
agree on earth concerning anything thatMATTHEW 18
99
they ask, it will be done for them by My
Father in heaven.
20 "For where two or three are gathered
together in My name, I am there in the
midst of them."
21 Then Peter came to Him and said,
"Lord, how o en shall my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him? Up to
seven mes?"
22 Jesus said to him, "I do not say to
you, up to seven mes, but up to seventy
mes seven.
23 "Therefore the kingdom of heaven is
like a certain king who wanted to se le
accounts with his servants.
24 "And when he had begun to se le
accounts, one was brought to him who
owed him ten thousand talents.
25 "But as he was not able to pay, his
master commanded that he be sold,
with his wife and children and all that he
had, and that payment be made.MATTHEW 18
100
26 "The servant therefore fell down
before him, saying, ‘Master, have
pa ence with me, and I will pay you all.’
27 "Then the master of that servant was
moved with compassion, released him,
and forgave him the debt.
28 "But that servant went out and found
one of his fellow servants who owed him
a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on
him and took him by the throat, saying,
‘Pay me what you owe!’
29 "So his fellow servant fell down at
his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have
pa ence with me, and I will pay you all.’
30 "And he would not, but went and
threw him into prison ll he should pay
the debt.
31 "So when his fellow servants saw
what had been done, they were very
grieved, and came and told their master
all that had been done.MATTHEW 18 – 19
32 "Then his master, a
101
er he had called
him, said to him, ‘You wicked servant!
I forgave you all that debt because you
begged me.
33 ‘Should you not also have had
compassion on your fellow servant, just
as I had pity on you?’
34 "And his master was angry, and
delivered him to the torturers un l he
should pay all that was due to him.
35 "So My heavenly Father also will do
to you if each of you, from his heart, does
not forgive his brother his trespasses."
1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus
had ﬁnished these sayings, that
He departed from Galilee and came to
the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
2 And great mul tudes followed Him,
and He healed them there.
3 The Pharisees also came to Him,
tes ng Him, and saying to Him, "Is it
19MATTHEW 19
102
lawful for a man to divorce his wife for
just any reason?"
4 And He answered and said to them,
"Have you not read that He who made
them at the beginning ‘made them male
and female,’
5 "and said, ‘For this reason a man
shall leave his father and mother and
be joined to his wife, and the two shall
become one ﬂesh’?
6 "So then, they are no longer two
but one ﬂesh. Therefore what God has
joined together, let not man separate."
7 They said to Him, "Why then did
Moses command to give a cer ﬁcate of
divorce, and to put her away?"
8 He said to them, "Moses, because of
the hardness of your hearts, permi ed
you to divorce your wives, but from the
beginning it was not so.
9 "And I say to you, whoever divorces his
wife, except for sexual immorality, andMATTHEW 19
103
marries another, commits adultery; and
whoever marries her who is divorced
commits adultery."
10 His disciples said to Him, "If such is
the case of the man with his wife, it is
be er not to marry."
11 But He said to them, "All cannot
accept this saying, but only those to
whom it has been given:
12 "For there are eunuchs who were
born thus from their mother’s womb,
and there are eunuchs who were made
eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs
who have made themselves eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He who is
able to accept it, let him accept it."
13 Then li le children were brought to
Him that He might put His hands on
them and pray, but the disciples rebuked
them.MATTHEW 19
14 But Jesus said, "Let the li
104
le children
come to Me, and do not forbid them; for
of such is the kingdom of heaven."
15 And He laid His hands on them and
departed from there.
16 Now behold, one came and said to
Him, "Good Teacher, what good thing
shall I do that I may have eternal life?"
17 So He said to him, "Why do you call
Me good? No one is good but One, that
is, God. But if you want to enter into life,
keep the commandments."
18 He said to Him, "Which ones?" Jesus
said, "‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall
not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not
steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’
19 ‘Honor your father and your mother,’
and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.’"
20 The young man said to Him, "All
these things I have kept from my youth.
What do I s ll lack?"MATTHEW 19
105
21 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be
perfect, go, sell what you have and give
to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven; and come, follow Me."
22 But when the young man heard that
saying, he went away sorrowful, for he
had great possessions.
23 Then Jesus said to His disciples,
"Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
heaven.
24 "And again I say to you, it is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God."
25 When His disciples heard it, they
were greatly astonished, saying, "Who
then can be saved?"
26 But Jesus looked at them and said to
them, "With men this is impossible, but
with God all things are possible."MATTHEW 19 – 20
106
27 Then Peter answered and said to
Him, "See, we have le all and followed
You. Therefore what shall we have?"
28 So Jesus said to them, "Assuredly
I say to you, that in the regenera on,
when the Son of Man sits on the throne
of His glory, you who have followed Me
will also sit on twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.
29 "And everyone who has le houses
or brothers or sisters or father or mother
or wife or children or lands, for My
name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold,
and inherit eternal life.
30 "But many who are ﬁrst will be last,
and the last ﬁrst.
1 "For the kingdom of heaven is
like a landowner who went out
early in the morning to hire laborers for
his vineyard.
20MATTHEW 20
107
2 "Now when he had agreed with the
laborers for a denarius a day, he sent
them into his vineyard.
3 "And he went out about the third
hour and saw others standing idle in the
marketplace,
4 "and said to them, ‘You also go into
the vineyard, and whatever is right I will
give you.’ So they went.
5 "Again he went out about the sixth
and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
6 "And about the eleventh hour he
went out and found others standing idle,
and said to them, ‘Why have you been
standing here idle all day?’
7 "They said to him, ‘Because no one
hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go
into the vineyard, and whatever is right
you will receive.’
8 "So when evening had come, the
owner of the vineyard said to his
steward, ‘Call the laborers and give themMATTHEW 20
108
their wages, beginning with the last to
the ﬁrst.’
9 "And when those came who were
hired about the eleventh hour, they each
received a denarius.
10 "But when the ﬁrst came, they
supposed that they would receive
more; and they likewise received each a
denarius.
11 "And when they had received it, they
complained against the landowner,
12 "saying, ‘These last men have worked
only one hour, and you made them equal
to us who have borne the burden and
the heat of the day.’
13 "But he answered one of them
and said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no
wrong. Did you not agree with me for a
denarius?
14 ‘Take what is yours and go your way.
I wish to give to this last man the same
as to you.MATTHEW 20
109
15 ‘Is it not lawful for me to do what I
wish with my own things? Or is your eye
evil because I am good?’
16 "So the last will be ﬁrst, and the
ﬁrst last. For many are called, but few
chosen."
17 Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem,
took the twelve disciples aside on the
road and said to them,
18 "Behold, we are going up to
Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be
betrayed to the chief priests and to the
scribes; and they will condemn Him to
death,
19 "and deliver Him to the Gen les to
mock and to scourge and to crucify. And
the third day He will rise again."
20 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons
came to Him with her sons, kneeling
down and asking something from Him.
21 And He said to her, "What do you
wish?" She said to Him, "Grant thatMATTHEW 20
110
these two sons of mine may sit, one on
Your right hand and the other on the
le , in Your kingdom."
22 But Jesus answered and said, "You do
not know what you ask. Are you able to
drink the cup that I am about to drink,
and be bap zed with the bap sm that
I am bap zed with?" They said to Him,
"We are able."
23 So He said to them, "You will indeed
drink My cup, and be bap zed with the
bap sm that I am bap zed with; but to
sit on My right hand and on My le is
not Mine to give, but it is for those for
whom it is prepared by My Father."
24 And when the ten heard it, they
were greatly displeased with the two
brothers.
25 But Jesus called them to Himself and
said, "You know that the rulers of the
Gen les lord it over them, and thoseMATTHEW 20
111
who are great exercise authority over
them.
26 "Yet it shall not be so among you; but
whoever desires to become great among
you, let him be your servant.
27 "And whoever desires to be ﬁrst
among you, let him be your slave––
28 "just as the Son of Man did not come
to be served, but to serve, and to give
His life a ransom for many."
29 Now as they went out of Jericho, a
great mul tude followed Him.
30 And behold, two blind men si ng
by the road, when they heard that Jesus
was passing by, cried out, saying, "Have
mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
31 Then the mul tude warned them
that they should be quiet; but they cried
out all the more, saying, "Have mercy on
us, O Lord, Son of David!"MATTHEW 20 – 21
32 So Jesus stood s
112
ll and called them,
and said, "What do you want Me to do
for you?"
33 They said to Him, "Lord, that our eyes
may be opened."
34 So Jesus had compassion and
touched their eyes. And immediately
their eyes received sight, and they
followed Him.
1 Now when they drew near
Jerusalem, and came to
Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then
Jesus sent two disciples,
2 saying to them, "Go into the village
opposite you, and immediately you will
ﬁnd a donkey ed, and a colt with her.
Loose them and bring them to Me.
3 "And if anyone says anything to you,
you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of
them,’ and immediately he will send
them."
21MATTHEW 21
113
4 All this was done that it might be
fulﬁlled which was spoken by the
prophet, saying:
5 "Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold,
your King is coming to you, Lowly, and
si ng on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a
donkey.’"
6 So the disciples went and did as Jesus
commanded them.
7 They brought the donkey and the colt,
laid their clothes on them, and set Him
on them.
8 And a very great mul tude spread
their clothes on the road; others cut
down branches from the trees and
spread them on the road.
9 Then the mul tudes who went before
and those who followed cried out,
saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David!
‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of
the LORD!’ Hosanna in the highest!"MATTHEW 21
114
10 And when He had come into
Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
saying, "Who is this?"
11 So the mul tudes said, "This is Jesus,
the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee."
12 Then Jesus went into the temple of
God and drove out all those who bought
and sold in the temple, and overturned
the tables of the money changers and
the seats of those who sold doves.
13 And He said to them, "It is wri en,
‘My house shall be called a house of
prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of
thieves.’"
14 Then the blind and the lame came to
Him in the temple, and He healed them.
15 But when the chief priests and
scribes saw the wonderful things that He
did, and the children crying out in the
temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son
of David!" they were indignantMATTHEW 21
115
16 and said to Him, "Do You hear what
these are saying?" And Jesus said to
them, "Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of
the mouth of babes and nursing infants
You have perfected praise’?"
17 Then He le them and went out of
the city to Bethany, and He lodged there.
18 Now in the morning, as He returned
to the city, He was hungry.
19 And seeing a ﬁg tree by the road, He
came to it and found nothing on it but
leaves, and said to it, "Let no fruit grow
on you ever again." Immediately the ﬁg
tree withered away.
20 And when the disciples saw it, they
marveled, saying, "How did the ﬁg tree
wither away so soon?"
21 So Jesus answered and said to them,
"Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith
and do not doubt, you will not only do
what was done to the ﬁg tree, but alsoMATTHEW 21
116
if you say to this mountain, ‘Be removed
and be cast into the sea,’ it will be done.
22 "And whatever things you ask in
prayer, believing, you will receive."
23 Now when He came into the temple,
the chief priests and the elders of
the people confronted Him as He was
teaching, and said, "By what authority
are You doing these things? And who
gave You this authority?"
24 But Jesus answered and said to them,
"I also will ask you one thing, which if
you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by
what authority I do these things:
25 "The bap sm of John––where was
it from? From heaven or from men?"
And they reasoned among themselves,
saying, "If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will
say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe
him?’MATTHEW 21
117
26 "But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear
the mul tude, for all count John as a
prophet."
27 So they answered Jesus and said,
"We do not know." And He said to them,
"Neither will I tell you by what authority
I do these things.
28 "But what do you think? A man
had two sons, and he came to the ﬁrst
and said, ‘Son, go, work today in my
vineyard.’
29 "He answered and said, ‘I will not,’
but a erward he regre ed it and went.
30 "Then he came to the second and
said likewise. And he answered and said,
‘I go, sir,’ but he did not go.
31 "Which of the two did the will of his
father?" They said to Him, "The ﬁrst."
Jesus said to them, "Assuredly, I say to
you that tax collectors and harlots enter
the kingdom of God before you.MATTHEW 21
118
32 "For John came to you in the way of
righteousness, and you did not believe
him; but tax collectors and harlots
believed him; and when you saw it, you
did not a erward relent and believe him.
33 "Hear another parable: There was
a certain landowner who planted a
vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug
a winepress in it and built a tower. And
he leased it to vinedressers and went
into a far country.
34 "Now when vintage– me drew near,
he sent his servants to the vinedressers,
that they might receive its fruit.
35 "And the vinedressers took his
servants, beat one, killed one, and
stoned another.
36 "Again he sent other servants, more
than the ﬁrst, and they did likewise to
them.
37 "Then last of all he sent his son to
them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’MATTHEW 21
119
38 "But when the vinedressers saw the
son, they said among themselves, ‘This
is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize
his inheritance.’
39 "So they took him and cast him out
of the vineyard and killed him.
40 "Therefore, when the owner of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those
vinedressers?"
41 They said to Him, "He will destroy
those wicked men miserably, and lease
his vineyard to other vinedressers who
will render to him the fruits in their
seasons."
42 Jesus said to them, "Have you never
read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone which
the builders rejected Has become the
chief cornerstone. This was the LORD’S
doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes’?
43 "Therefore I say to you, the kingdom
of God will be taken from you and given
to a na on bearing the fruits of it.MATTHEW 21 – 22
120
44 "And whoever falls on this stone will
be broken; but on whomever it falls, it
will grind him to powder."
45 Now when the chief priests and
Pharisees heard His parables, they
perceived that He was speaking of them.
46 But when they sought to lay hands
on Him, they feared the mul tudes,
because they took Him for a prophet.
1 And Jesus answered and spoke
to them again by parables and
said:
2 "The kingdom of heaven is like a
certain king who arranged a marriage for
his son,
3 "and sent out his servants to call those
who were invited to the wedding; and
they were not willing to come.
4 "Again, he sent out other servants,
saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, "See,
I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and
22MATTHEW 22
121
fa ed ca le are killed, and all things are
ready. Come to the wedding."’
5 "But they made light of it and went
their ways, one to his own farm, another
to his business.
6 "And the rest seized his servants,
treated them spitefully, and killed them.
7 "But when the king heard about it, he
was furious. And he sent out his armies,
destroyed those murderers, and burned
up their city.
8 "Then he said to his servants, ‘The
wedding is ready, but those who were
invited were not worthy.
9 ‘Therefore go into the highways,
and as many as you ﬁnd, invite to the
wedding.’
10 "So those servants went out into
the highways and gathered together all
whom they found, both bad and good.
And the wedding hall was ﬁlled with
guests.MATTHEW 22
122
11 "But when the king came in to see
the guests, he saw a man there who did
not have on a wedding garment.
12 "So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did
you come in here without a wedding
garment?’ And he was speechless.
13 "Then the king said to the servants,
‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away,
and cast him into outer darkness; there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
14 "For many are called, but few are
chosen."
15 Then the Pharisees went and plo ed
how they might entangle Him in His talk.
16 And they sent to Him their disciples
with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher,
we know that You are true, and teach
the way of God in truth; nor do You care
about anyone, for You do not regard the
person of men.MATTHEW 22
123
17 "Tell us, therefore, what do You
think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar,
or not?"
18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness,
and said, "Why do you test Me, you
hypocrites?
19 "Show Me the tax money." So they
brought Him a denarius.
20 And He said to them, "Whose image
and inscrip on is this?"
21 They said to Him, "Caesar’s." And
He said to them, "Render therefore to
Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and
to God the things that are God’s."
22 When they had heard these words,
they marveled, and le Him and went
their way.
23 The same day the Sadducees, who
say there is no resurrec on, came to
Him and asked Him,
24 saying: "Teacher, Moses said that
if a man dies, having no children, hisMATTHEW 22
124
brother shall marry his wife and raise up
oﬀspring for his brother.
25 "Now there were with us seven
brothers. The ﬁrst died a er he had
married, and having no oﬀspring, le his
wife to his brother.
26 "Likewise the second also, and the
third, even to the seventh.
27 "Last of all the woman died also.
28 "Therefore, in the resurrec on,
whose wife of the seven will she be? For
they all had her."
29 Jesus answered and said to them,
"You are mistaken, not knowing the
Scriptures nor the power of God.
30 "For in the resurrec on they neither
marry nor are given in marriage, but are
like angels of God in heaven.
31 "But concerning the resurrec on of
the dead, have you not read what was
spoken to you by God, saying,MATTHEW 22
125
32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not
the God of the dead, but of the living."
33 And when the mul tudes heard this,
they were astonished at His teaching.
34 But when the Pharisees heard that
He had silenced the Sadducees, they
gathered together.
35 Then one of them, a lawyer, asked
Him a ques on, tes ng Him, and saying,
36 "Teacher, which is the great
commandment in the law?"
37 Jesus said to him, "‘You shall love the
LORD your God with all your heart, with
all your soul, and with all your mind.’
38 "This is the ﬁrst and great
commandment.
39 "And the second is like it: ‘You shall
love your neighbor as yourself.’
40 "On these two commandments hang
all the Law and the Prophets."MATTHEW 22 – 23
126
41 While the Pharisees were gathered
together, Jesus asked them,
42 saying, "What do you think about the
Christ? Whose Son is He?" They said to
Him, "The Son of David."
43 He said to them, "How then does
David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying:
44 ‘The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My
right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your
footstool"’?
45 "If David then calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is
He his Son?"
46 And no one was able to answer Him
a word, nor from that day on did anyone
dare ques on Him anymore.
1 Then Jesus spoke to the
mul tudes and to His disciples,
2 saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees
sit in Moses’ seat.
3 "Therefore whatever they tell you to
observe, that observe and do, but do not
23MATTHEW 23
127
do according to their works; for they say,
and do not do.
4 "For they bind heavy burdens, hard to
bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders;
but they themselves will not move them
with one of their ﬁngers.
5 "But all their works they do to be seen
by men. They make their phylacteries
broad and enlarge the borders of their
garments.
6 "They love the best places at feasts,
the best seats in the synagogues,
7 "gree ngs in the marketplaces, and to
be called by men, ‘Rabbi, Rabbi.’
8 "But you, do not be called ‘Rabbi’; for
One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you
are all brethren.
9 "Do not call anyone on earth your
father; for One is your Father, He who is
in heaven.
10 "And do not be called teachers; for
One is your Teacher, the Christ.MATTHEW 23
128
11 "But he who is greatest among you
shall be your servant.
12 "And whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and he who humbles himself
will be exalted.
13 "But woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up
the kingdom of heaven against men; for
you neither go in yourselves, nor do you
allow those who are entering to go in.
14 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you devour widows’
houses, and for a pretense make long
prayers. Therefore you will receive
greater condemna on.
15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you travel land and sea
to win one proselyte, and when he is
won, you make him twice as much a son
of hell as yourselves.
16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say,
‘Whoever swears by the temple, it isMATTHEW 23
129
nothing; but whoever swears by the gold
of the temple, he is obliged to perform
it.’
17 "Fools and blind! For which is greater,
the gold or the temple that sanc ﬁes the
gold?
18 "And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar,
it is nothing; but whoever swears by the
gi that is on it, he is obliged to perform
it.’
19 "Fools and blind! For which is greater,
the gi or the altar that sanc ﬁes the
gi ?
20 "Therefore he who swears by the
altar, swears by it and by all things on it.
21 "He who swears by the temple,
swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
22 "And he who swears by heaven,
swears by the throne of God and by Him
who sits on it.
23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you pay the of mint andMATTHEW 23
130
anise and cummin, and have neglected
the weigh er ma ers of the law: jus ce
and mercy and faith. These you ought to
have done, without leaving the others
undone.
24 "Blind guides, who strain out a gnat
and swallow a camel!
25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside
of the cup and dish, but inside they are
full of extor on and self–indulgence.
26 "Blind Pharisee, ﬁrst cleanse the
inside of the cup and dish, that the
outside of them may be clean also.
27 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed
tombs which indeed appear beau ful
outwardly, but inside are full of dead
men’s bones and all uncleanness.
28 "Even so you also outwardly appear
righteous to men, but inside you are full
of hypocrisy and lawlessness.MATTHEW 23
131
29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! Because you build the
tombs of the prophets and adorn the
monuments of the righteous,
30 "and say, ‘If we had lived in the days
of our fathers, we would not have been
partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets.’
31 "Therefore you are witnesses against
yourselves that you are sons of those
who murdered the prophets.
32 "Fill up, then, the measure of your
fathers’ guilt.
33 "Serpents, brood of vipers! How can
you escape the condemna on of hell?
34 "Therefore, indeed, I send you
prophets, wise men, and scribes: some
of them you will kill and crucify, and
some of them you will scourge in your
synagogues and persecute from city to
city,MATTHEW 23 – 24
132
35 "that on you may come all the
righteous blood shed on the earth, from
the blood of righteous Abel to the blood
of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom
you murdered between the temple and
the altar.
36 "Assuredly, I say to you, all these
things will come upon this genera on.
37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one
who kills the prophets and stones those
who are sent to her! How o en I wanted
to gather your children together, as a
hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
but you were not willing!
38 "See! Your house is le to you
desolate;
39 "for I say to you, you shall see Me
no more ll you say, ‘Blessed is He who
comes in the name of the LORD!’"
1 Then Jesus went out and
departed from the temple, and
24MATTHEW 24
133
His disciples came up to show Him the
buildings of the temple.
2 And Jesus said to them, "Do you not
see all these things? Assuredly, I say
to you, not one stone shall be le here
upon another, that shall not be thrown
down."
3 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives,
the disciples came to Him privately,
saying, "Tell us, when will these things
be? And what will be the sign of Your
coming, and of the end of the age?"
4 And Jesus answered and said to them:
"Take heed that no one deceives you.
5 "For many will come in My name,
saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive
many.
6 "And you will hear of wars and rumors
of wars. See that you are not troubled;
for all these things must come to pass,
but the end is not yet.MATTHEW 24
7 "For na
134
on will rise against na on,
and kingdom against kingdom. And
there will be famines, pes lences, and
earthquakes in various places.
8 "All these are the beginning of
sorrows.
9 "Then they will deliver you up to
tribula on and kill you, and you will be
hated by all na ons for My name’s sake.
10 "And then many will be oﬀended,
will betray one another, and will hate
one another.
11 "Then many false prophets will rise
up and deceive many.
12 "And because lawlessness will
abound, the love of many will grow cold.
13 "But he who endures to the end shall
be saved.
14 "And this gospel of the kingdom will
be preached in all the world as a witness
to all the na ons, and then the end will
come.MATTHEW 24
135
15 "Therefore when you see the
‘abomina on of desola on,’ spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, standing in the
holy place" (whoever reads, let him
understand),
16 "then let those who are in Judea ﬂee
to the mountains.
17 "Let him who is on the housetop
not go down to take anything out of his
house.
18 "And let him who is in the ﬁeld not
go back to get his clothes.
19 "But woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who are nursing babies in
those days!
20 "And pray that your ﬂight may not be
in winter or on the Sabbath.
21 "For then there will be great
tribula on, such as has not been since
the beginning of the world un l this
me, no, nor ever shall be.MATTHEW 24
136
22 "And unless those days were
shortened, no ﬂesh would be saved; but
for the elect’s sake those days will be
shortened.
23 "Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look,
here is the Christ!’ or ‘There!’ do not
believe it.
24 "For false christs and false prophets
will rise and show great signs and
wonders to deceive, if possible, even the
elect.
25 "See, I have told you beforehand.
26 "Therefore if they say to you, ‘Look,
He is in the desert!’ do not go out; or
‘Look, He is in the inner rooms!’ do not
believe it.
27 "For as the lightning comes from the
east and ﬂashes to the west, so also will
the coming of the Son of Man be.
28 "For wherever the carcass is, there
the eagles will be gathered together.MATTHEW 24
29 "Immediately a
137
er the tribula on of
those days the sun will be darkened, and
the moon will not give its light; the stars
will fall from heaven, and the powers of
the heavens will be shaken.
30 "Then the sign of the Son of Man will
appear in heaven, and then all the tribes
of the earth will mourn, and they will see
the Son of Man coming on the clouds of
heaven with power and great glory.
31 "And He will send His angels with a
great sound of a trumpet, and they will
gather together His elect from the four
winds, from one end of heaven to the
other.
32 "Now learn this parable from the
ﬁg tree: When its branch has already
become tender and puts forth leaves,
you know that summer is near.
33 "So you also, when you see all these
things, know that it is near––at the
doors!MATTHEW 24
138
34 "Assuredly, I say to you, this
genera on will by no means pass away
ll all these things take place.
35 "Heaven and earth will pass away,
but My words will by no means pass
away.
36 "But of that day and hour no one
knows, not even the angels of heaven,
but My Father only.
37 "But as the days of Noah were, so
also will the coming of the Son of Man
be.
38 "For as in the days before the ﬂood,
they were ea ng and drinking, marrying
and giving in marriage, un l the day that
Noah entered the ark,
39 "and did not know un l the ﬂood
came and took them all away, so also
will the coming of the Son of Man be.
40 "Then two men will be in the ﬁeld:
one will be taken and the other le .MATTHEW 24
139
41 "Two women will be grinding at the
mill: one will be taken and the other le .
42 "Watch therefore, for you do not
know what hour your Lord is coming.
43 "But know this, that if the master
of the house had known what hour
the thief would come, he would have
watched and not allowed his house to
be broken into.
44 "Therefore you also be ready, for the
Son of Man is coming at an hour you do
not expect.
45 "Who then is a faithful and wise
servant, whom his master made ruler
over his household, to give them food in
due season?
46 "Blessed is that servant whom his
master, when he comes, will ﬁnd so
doing.
47 "Assuredly, I say to you that he will
make him ruler over all his goods.MATTHEW 24 – 25
140
48 "But if that evil servant says in his
heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’
49 "and begins to beat his fellow
servants, and to eat and drink with the
drunkards,
50 "the master of that servant will come
on a day when he is not looking for him
and at an hour that he is not aware of,
51 "and will cut him in two and appoint
him his por on with the hypocrites.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.
1 "Then the kingdom of heaven
shall be likened to ten virgins who
took their lamps and went out to meet
the bridegroom.
2 "Now ﬁve of them were wise, and ﬁve
were foolish.
3 "Those who were foolish took their
lamps and took no oil with them,
4 "but the wise took oil in their vessels
with their lamps.
25MATTHEW 25
141
5 "But while the bridegroom was
delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
6 "And at midnight a cry was heard:
‘Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go
out to meet him!’
7 "Then all those virgins arose and
trimmed their lamps.
8 "And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give
us some of your oil, for our lamps are
going out.’
9 "But the wise answered, saying, ‘No,
lest there should not be enough for us
and you; but go rather to those who sell,
and buy for yourselves.’
10 "And while they went to buy, the
bridegroom came, and those who were
ready went in with him to the wedding;
and the door was shut.
11 "A erward the other virgins came
also, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’MATTHEW 25
142
12 "But he answered and said,
‘Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know
you.’
13 "Watch therefore, for you know
neither the day nor the hour in which
the Son of Man is coming.
14 "For the kingdom of heaven is like
a man traveling to a far country, who
called his own servants and delivered his
goods to them.
15 "And to one he gave ﬁve talents, to
another two, and to another one, to
each according to his own ability; and
immediately he went on a journey.
16 "Then he who had received the ﬁve
talents went and traded with them, and
made another ﬁve talents.
17 "And likewise he who had received
two gained two more also.
18 "But he who had received one went
and dug in the ground, and hid his lord’s
money.MATTHEW 25
19 "A
143
er a long me the lord of those
servants came and se led accounts with
them.
20 "So he who had received ﬁve talents
came and brought ﬁve other talents,
saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me ﬁve
talents; look, I have gained ﬁve more
talents besides them.’
21 "His lord said to him, ‘Well done,
good and faithful servant; you were
faithful over a few things, I will make you
ruler over many things. Enter into the
joy of your lord.’
22 "He also who had received two
talents came and said, ‘Lord, you
delivered to me two talents; look, I have
gained two more talents besides them.’
23 "His lord said to him, ‘Well done,
good and faithful servant; you have been
faithful over a few things, I will make you
ruler over many things. Enter into the
joy of your lord.’MATTHEW 25
144
24 "Then he who had received the one
talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you
to be a hard man, reaping where you
have not sown, and gathering where you
have not sca ered seed.
25 ‘And I was afraid, and went and hid
your talent in the ground. Look, there
you have what is yours.’
26 "But his lord answered and said to
him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you
knew that I reap where I have not sown,
and gather where I have not sca ered
seed.
27 ‘So you ought to have deposited
my money with the bankers, and at my
coming I would have received back my
own with interest.
28 ‘Therefore take the talent from him,
and give it to him who has ten talents.
29 ‘For to everyone who has, more will
be given, and he will have abundance;MATTHEW 25
145
but from him who does not have, even
what he has will be taken away.
30 ‘And cast the unproﬁtable servant
into the outer darkness. There will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
31 "When the Son of Man comes in His
glory, and all the holy angels with Him,
then He will sit on the throne of His
glory.
32 "All the na ons will be gathered
before Him, and He will separate them
one from another, as a shepherd divides
his sheep from the goats.
33 "And He will set the sheep on His
right hand, but the goats on the le .
34 "Then the King will say to those on
His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the founda on of the world:
35 ‘for I was hungry and you gave Me
food; I was thirsty and you gave MeMATTHEW 25
146
drink; I was a stranger and you took Me
in;
36 ‘I was naked and you clothed Me;
I was sick and you visited Me; I was in
prison and you came to Me.’
37 "Then the righteous will answer
Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You
hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give
You drink?
38 ‘When did we see You a stranger and
take You in, or naked and clothe You?
39 ‘Or when did we see You sick, or in
prison, and come to You?’
40 "And the King will answer and say to
them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch
as you did it to one of the least of these
My brethren, you did it to Me.’
41 "Then He will also say to those on the
le hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed,
into the everlas ng ﬁre prepared for the
devil and his angels:MATTHEW 25 – 26
147
42 ‘for I was hungry and you gave Me no
food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no
drink;
43 ‘I was a stranger and you did not take
Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me,
sick and in prison and you did not visit
Me.’
44 "Then they also will answer Him,
saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You
hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked
or sick or in prison, and did not minister
to You?’
45 "Then He will answer them, saying,
‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you
did not do it to one of the least of these,
you did not do it to Me.’
46 "And these will go away into
everlas ng punishment, but the
righteous into eternal life."
1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus
had ﬁnished all these sayings,
that He said to His disciples,
26MATTHEW 26
2 "You know that a
148
er two days is the
Passover, and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be cruciﬁed."
3 Then the chief priests, the scribes,
and the elders of the people assembled
at the palace of the high priest, who was
called Caiaphas,
4 and plo ed to take Jesus by trickery
and kill Him.
5 But they said, "Not during the feast,
lest there be an uproar among the
people."
6 And when Jesus was in Bethany at the
house of Simon the leper,
7 a woman came to Him having an
alabaster ﬂask of very costly fragrant oil,
and she poured it on His head as He sat
at the table.
8 But when His disciples saw it, they
were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
9 "For this fragrant oil might have been
sold for much and given to the poor."MATTHEW 26
149
10 But when Jesus was aware of it, He
said to them, "Why do you trouble the
woman? For she has done a good work
for Me.
11 "For you have the poor with you
always, but Me you do not have always.
12 "For in pouring this fragrant oil on
My body, she did it for My burial.
13 "Assuredly, I say to you, wherever
this gospel is preached in the whole
world, what this woman has done will
also be told as a memorial to her."
14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas
Iscariot, went to the chief priests
15 and said, "What are you willing to
give me if I deliver Him to you?" And
they counted out to him thirty pieces of
silver.
16 So from that me he sought
opportunity to betray Him.
17 Now on the ﬁrst day of the Feast
of the Unleavened Bread the disciplesMATTHEW 26
150
came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do
You want us to prepare for You to eat the
Passover?"
18 And He said, "Go into the city to
a certain man, and say to him, ‘The
Teacher says, "My me is at hand; I will
keep the Passover at your house with
My disciples."’"
19 So the disciples did as Jesus had
directed them; and they prepared the
Passover.
20 When evening had come, He sat
down with the twelve.
21 Now as they were ea ng, He said,
"Assuredly, I say to you, one of you will
betray Me."
22 And they were exceedingly sorrowful,
and each of them began to say to Him,
"Lord, is it I?"
23 He answered and said, "He who
dipped his hand with Me in the dish will
betray Me.MATTHEW 26
151
24 "The Son of Man indeed goes just as
it is wri en of Him, but woe to that man
by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It
would have been good for that man if he
had not been born."
25 Then Judas, who was betraying Him,
answered and said, "Rabbi, is it I?" He
said to him, "You have said it."
26 And as they were ea ng, Jesus took
bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it
to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this
is My body."
27 Then He took the cup, and gave
thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
"Drink from it, all of you.
28 "For this is My blood of the new
covenant, which is shed for many for the
remission of sins.
29 "But I say to you, I will not drink of
this fruit of the vine from now on un l
that day when I drink it new with you in
My Father’s kingdom."MATTHEW 26
152
30 And when they had sung a hymn,
they went out to the Mount of Olives.
31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you
will be made to stumble because of Me
this night, for it is wri en: ‘I will strike
the Shepherd, And the sheep of the ﬂock
will be sca ered.’
32 "But a er I have been raised, I will go
before you to Galilee."
33 Peter answered and said to Him,
"Even if all are made to stumble because
of You, I will never be made to stumble."
34 Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I say to
you that this night, before the rooster
crows, you will deny Me three mes."
35 Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to
die with You, I will not deny You!" And so
said all the disciples.
36 Then Jesus came with them to a
place called Gethsemane, and said to
the disciples, "Sit here while I go and
pray over there."MATTHEW 26
153
37 And He took with Him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, and He began to
be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
38 Then He said to them, "My soul is
exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
Stay here and watch with Me."
39 He went a li le farther and fell on His
face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if
it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;
nevertheless, not as I will, but as You
will."
40 Then He came to the disciples and
found them asleep, and said to Peter,
"What? Could you not watch with Me
one hour?
41 "Watch and pray, lest you enter into
tempta on. The spirit indeed is willing,
but the ﬂesh is weak."
42 Again, a second me, He went away
and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this
cup cannot pass away from Me unless I
drink it, Your will be done."MATTHEW 26
154
43 And He came and found them asleep
again, for their eyes were heavy.
44 So He le them, went away again,
and prayed the third me, saying the
same words.
45 Then He came to His disciples and
said to them, "Are you s ll sleeping and
res ng? Behold, the hour is at hand, and
the Son of Man is being betrayed into
the hands of sinners.
46 "Rise, let us be going. See, My
betrayer is at hand."
47 And while He was s ll speaking,
behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a
great mul tude with swords and clubs,
came from the chief priests and elders
of the people.
48 Now His betrayer had given them a
sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the
One; seize Him."
49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and
said, "Gree ngs, Rabbi!" and kissed Him.MATTHEW 26
155
50 But Jesus said to him, "Friend, why
have you come?" Then they came and
laid hands on Jesus and took Him.
51 And suddenly, one of those who
were with Jesus stretched out his hand
and drew his sword, struck the servant
of the high priest, and cut oﬀ his ear.
52 But Jesus said to him, "Put your
sword in its place, for all who take the
sword will perish by the sword.
53 "Or do you think that I cannot now
pray to My Father, and He will provide
Me with more than twelve legions of
angels?
54 "How then could the Scriptures be
fulﬁlled, that it must happen thus?"
55 In that hour Jesus said to the
mul tudes, "Have you come out, as
against a robber, with swords and clubs
to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching
in the temple, and you did not seize Me.MATTHEW 26
156
56 "But all this was done that the
Scriptures of the prophets might be
fulﬁlled." Then all the disciples forsook
Him and ﬂed.
57 And those who had laid hold of
Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high
priest, where the scribes and the elders
were assembled.
58 But Peter followed Him at a distance
to the high priest’s courtyard. And he
went in and sat with the servants to see
the end.
59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and
all the council sought false tes mony
against Jesus to put Him to death,
60 but found none. Even though many
false witnesses came forward, they
found none. But at last two false
witnesses came forward
61 and said, "This fellow said, ‘I am able
to destroy the temple of God and to
build it in three days.’"MATTHEW 26
157
62 And the high priest arose and said to
Him, "Do You answer nothing? What is it
these men tes fy against You?"
63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high
priest answered and said to Him, "I put
You under oath by the living God: Tell us
if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"
64 Jesus said to him, "It is as you said.
Nevertheless, I say to you, herea er you
will see the Son of Man si ng at the
right hand of the Power, and coming on
the clouds of heaven."
65 Then the high priest tore his clothes,
saying, "He has spoken blasphemy!
What further need do we have of
witnesses? Look, now you have heard
His blasphemy!
66 "What do you think?" They answered
and said, "He is deserving of death."
67 Then they spat in His face and beat
Him; and others struck Him with the
palms of their hands,MATTHEW 26
158
68 saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who
is the one who struck You?"
69 Now Peter sat outside in the
courtyard. And a servant girl came to
him, saying, "You also were with Jesus of
Galilee."
70 But he denied it before them all,
saying, "I do not know what you are
saying."
71 And when he had gone out to the
gateway, another girl saw him and said
to those who were there, "This fellow
also was with Jesus of Nazareth."
72 But again he denied with an oath, "I
do not know the Man!"
73 And a li le later those who stood by
came up and said to Peter, "Surely you
also are one of them, for your speech
betrays you."
74 Then he began to curse and swear,
saying, "I do not know the Man!"
Immediately a rooster crowed.MATTHEW 26 – 27
159
75 And Peter remembered the word of
Jesus who had said to him, "Before the
rooster crows, you will deny Me three
mes." So he went out and wept bi erly.
1 When morning came, all the
chief priests and elders of the
people plo ed against Jesus to put Him
to death.
2 And when they had bound Him, they
led Him away and delivered Him to
Pon us Pilate the governor.
3 Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing
that He had been condemned, was
remorseful and brought back the thirty
pieces of silver to the chief priests and
elders,
4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying
innocent blood." And they said, "What is
that to us? You see to it!"
5 Then he threw down the pieces of
silver in the temple and departed, and
went and hanged himself.
27MATTHEW 27
160
6 But the chief priests took the silver
pieces and said, "It is not lawful to put
them into the treasury, because they are
the price of blood."
7 And they consulted together and
bought with them the po er’s ﬁeld, to
bury strangers in.
8 Therefore that ﬁeld has been called
the Field of Blood to this day.
9 Then was fulﬁlled what was spoken by
Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they
took the thirty pieces of silver, the value
of Him who was priced, whom they of
the children of Israel priced,
10 "and gave them for the po er’s ﬁeld,
as the LORD directed me."
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor.
And the governor asked Him, saying,
"Are You the King of the Jews?" So Jesus
said to him, "It is as you say."MATTHEW 27
161
12 And while He was being accused by
the chief priests and elders, He answered
nothing.
13 Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You
not hear how many things they tes fy
against You?"
14 But He answered him not one word,
so that the governor marveled greatly.
15 Now at the feast the governor
was accustomed to releasing to the
mul tude one prisoner whom they
wished.
16 And at that me they had a notorious
prisoner called Barabbas.
17 Therefore, when they had gathered
together, Pilate said to them, "Whom
do you want me to release to you?
Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
18 For he knew that they had handed
Him over because of envy.
19 While he was si ng on the judgment
seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "HaveMATTHEW 27
162
nothing to do with that just Man, for
I have suﬀered many things today in a
dream because of Him."
20 But the chief priests and elders
persuaded the mul tudes that they
should ask for Barabbas and destroy
Jesus.
21 The governor answered and said
to them, "Which of the two do you
want me to release to you?" They said,
"Barabbas!"
22 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I
do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They
all said to him, "Let Him be cruciﬁed!"
23 Then the governor said, "Why, what
evil has He done?" But they cried out all
the more, saying, "Let Him be cruciﬁed!"
24 When Pilate saw that he could not
prevail at all, but rather that a tumult
was rising, he took water and washed
his hands before the mul tude, saying,MATTHEW 27
163
"I am innocent of the blood of this just
Person. You see to it."
25 And all the people answered and
said, "His blood be on us and on our
children."
26 Then he released Barabbas to them;
and when he had scourged Jesus, he
delivered Him to be cruciﬁed.
27 Then the soldiers of the governor
took Jesus into the Praetorium and
gathered the whole garrison around
Him.
28 And they stripped Him and put a
scarlet robe on Him.
29 When they had twisted a crown of
thorns, they put it on His head, and a
reed in His right hand. And they bowed
the knee before Him and mocked Him,
saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
30 Then they spat on Him, and took the
reed and struck Him on the head.MATTHEW 27
164
31 And when they had mocked Him,
they took the robe oﬀ Him, put His own
clothes on Him, and led Him away to be
cruciﬁed.
32 Now as they came out, they found
a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him
they compelled to bear His cross.
33 And when they had come to a place
called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a
Skull,
34 they gave Him sour wine mingled
with gall to drink. But when He had
tasted it, He would not drink.
35 Then they cruciﬁed Him, and divided
His garments, cas ng lots, that it might
be fulﬁlled which was spoken by the
prophet: "They divided My garments
among them, And for My clothing they
cast lots."
36 Si ng down, they kept watch over
Him there.MATTHEW 27
165
37 And they put up over His head the
accusa on wri en against Him: THIS IS
JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
38 Then two robbers were cruciﬁed with
Him, one on the right and another on
the le .
39 And those who passed by
blasphemed Him, wagging their
heads
40 and saying, "You who destroy the
temple and build it in three days, save
Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come
down from the cross."
41 Likewise the chief priests also,
mocking with the scribes and elders,
said,
42 "He saved others; Himself He cannot
save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him
now come down from the cross, and we
will believe Him.MATTHEW 27
166
43 "He trusted in God; let Him deliver
Him now if He will have Him; for He said,
‘I am the Son of God.’"
44 Even the robbers who were cruciﬁed
with Him reviled Him with the same
thing.
45 Now from the sixth hour un l the
ninth hour there was darkness over all
the land.
46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried
out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli,
lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, My
God, why have You forsaken Me?"
47 Some of those who stood there,
when they heard that, said, "This Man is
calling for Elijah!"
48 Immediately one of them ran and
took a sponge, ﬁlled it with sour wine
and put it on a reed, and oﬀered it to
Him to drink.
49 The rest said, "Let Him alone; let us
see if Elijah will come to save Him."MATTHEW 27
167
50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud
voice, and yielded up His spirit.
51 Then, behold, the veil of the temple
was torn in two from top to bo om; and
the earth quaked, and the rocks were
split,
52 and the graves were opened; and
many bodies of the saints who had fallen
asleep were raised;
53 and coming out of the graves a er
His resurrec on, they went into the holy
city and appeared to many.
54 So when the centurion and those
with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw
the earthquake and the things that had
happened, they feared greatly, saying,
"Truly this was the Son of God!"
55 And many women who followed
Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,
were there looking on from afar,MATTHEW 27
168
56 among whom were Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of James and Joses,
and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
57 Now when evening had come, there
came a rich man from Arimathea, named
Joseph, who himself had also become a
disciple of Jesus.
58 This man went to Pilate and asked
for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
commanded the body to be given to
him.
59 When Joseph had taken the body, he
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
60 and laid it in his new tomb which he
had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled
a large stone against the door of the
tomb, and departed.
61 And Mary Magdalene was there,
and the other Mary, si ng opposite the
tomb.MATTHEW 27 – 28
169
62 On the next day, which followed the
Day of Prepara on, the chief priests and
Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,
63 saying, "Sir, we remember, while He
was s ll alive, how that deceiver said,
‘A er three days I will rise.’
64 "Therefore command that the tomb
be made secure un l the third day, lest
His disciples come by night and steal
Him away, and say to the people, ‘He
has risen from the dead.’ So the last
decep on will be worse than the ﬁrst."
65 Pilate said to them, "You have a
guard; go your way, make it as secure as
you know how."
66 So they went and made the tomb
secure, sealing the stone and se ng the
guard.
1 Now a er the Sabbath, as the
ﬁrst day of the week began to
dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary came to see the tomb.
28MATTHEW 28
170
2 And behold, there was a great
earthquake; for an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven, and came and
rolled back the stone from the door, and
sat on it.
3 His countenance was like lightning,
and his clothing as white as snow.
4 And the guards shook for fear of him,
and became like dead men.
5 But the angel answered and said to
the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know
that you seek Jesus who was cruciﬁed.
6 "He is not here; for He is risen, as He
said. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay.
7 "And go quickly and tell His disciples
that He is risen from the dead, and
indeed He is going before you into
Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I
have told you."MATTHEW 28
171
8 So they went out quickly from the
tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to
bring His disciples word.
9 And as they went to tell His disciples,
behold, Jesus met them, saying,
"Rejoice!" So they came and held Him by
the feet and worshiped Him.
10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be
afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to
Galilee, and there they will see Me."
11 Now while they were going, behold,
some of the guard came into the city
and reported to the chief priests all the
things that had happened.
12 When they had assembled with the
elders and consulted together, they gave
a large sum of money to the soldiers,
13 saying, "Tell them, ‘His disciples came
at night and stole Him away while we
slept.’MATTHEW 28
172
14 "And if this comes to the governor’s
ears, we will appease him and make you
secure."
15 So they took the money and did as
they were instructed; and this saying
is commonly reported among the Jews
un l this day.
16 Then the eleven disciples went away
into Galilee, to the mountain which
Jesus had appointed for them.
17 When they saw Him, they worshiped
Him; but some doubted.
18 And Jesus came and spoke to them,
saying, "All authority has been given to
Me in heaven and on earth.
19 "Go therefore and make disciples of
all the na ons, bap zing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit,
20 "teaching them to observe all things
that I have commanded you; and lo, I amMATTHEW 28
173
with you always, even to the end of the
age." Amen.Mark
1
1 The beginning of the gospel of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
2 As it is wri en in the Prophets:
"Behold, I send My messenger before
Your face, Who will prepare Your way
before You."
3 "The voice of one crying in the
wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the
LORD; Make His paths straight.’"
4 John came bap zing in the wilderness
and preaching a bap sm of repentance
for the remission of sins.
5 Then all the land of Judea, and those
from Jerusalem, went out to him and
were all bap zed by him in the Jordan
River, confessing their sins.MARK 1
2
6 Now John was clothed with camel’s
hair and with a leather belt around his
waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
7 And he preached, saying, "There
comes One a er me who is migh er
than I, whose sandal strap I am not
worthy to stoop down and loose.
8 "I indeed bap zed you with water, but
He will bap ze you with the Holy Spirit."
9 It came to pass in those days that
Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee,
and was bap zed by John in the Jordan.
10 And immediately, coming up from
the water, He saw the heavens par ng
and the Spirit descending upon Him like
a dove.
11 Then a voice came from heaven, "You
are My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased."
12 Immediately the Spirit drove Him
into the wilderness.MARK 1
3
13 And He was there in the wilderness
forty days, tempted by Satan, and was
with the wild beasts; and the angels
ministered to Him.
14 Now a er John was put in prison,
Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the
gospel of the kingdom of God,
15 and saying, "The me is fulﬁlled, and
the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent,
and believe in the gospel."
16 And as He walked by the Sea of
Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his
brother cas ng a net into the sea; for
they were ﬁshermen.
17 Then Jesus said to them, "Follow Me,
and I will make you become ﬁshers of
men."
18 They immediately le their nets and
followed Him.
19 When He had gone a li le farther
from there, He saw James the son ofMARK 1
4
Zebedee, and John his brother, who also
were in the boat mending their nets.
20 And immediately He called them,
and they le their father Zebedee in the
boat with the hired servants, and went
a er Him.
21 Then they went into Capernaum, and
immediately on the Sabbath He entered
the synagogue and taught.
22 And they were astonished at His
teaching, for He taught them as one
having authority, and not as the scribes.
23 Now there was a man in their
synagogue with an unclean spirit. And
he cried out,
24 saying, "Let us alone! What have we
to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did
You come to destroy us? I know who You
are––the Holy One of God!"
25 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be
quiet, and come out of him!"MARK 1
5
26 And when the unclean spirit had
convulsed him and cried out with a loud
voice, he came out of him.
27 Then they were all amazed, so that
they ques oned among themselves,
saying, "What is this? What new doctrine
is this? For with authority He commands
even the unclean spirits, and they obey
Him."
28 And immediately His fame spread
throughout all the region around Galilee.
29 Now as soon as they had come out of
the synagogue, they entered the house
of Simon and Andrew, with James and
John.
30 But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick
with a fever, and they told Him about
her at once.
31 So He came and took her by the hand
and li ed her up, and immediately the
fever le her. And she served them.MARK 1
6
32 At evening, when the sun had set,
they brought to Him all who were sick
and those who were demon–possessed.
33 And the whole city was gathered
together at the door.
34 Then He healed many who were
sick with various diseases, and cast out
many demons; and He did not allow the
demons to speak, because they knew
Him.
35 Now in the morning, having risen a
long while before daylight, He went out
and departed to a solitary place; and
there He prayed.
36 And Simon and those who were with
Him searched for Him.
37 When they found Him, they said to
Him, "Everyone is looking for You."
38 But He said to them, "Let us go into
the next towns, that I may preach there
also, because for this purpose I have
come forth."MARK 1
7
39 And He was preaching in their
synagogues throughout all Galilee, and
cas ng out demons.
40 Now a leper came to Him, imploring
Him, kneeling down to Him and saying
to Him, "If You are willing, You can make
me clean."
41 Then Jesus, moved with compassion,
stretched out His hand and touched
him, and said to him, "I am willing; be
cleansed."
42 As soon as He had spoken,
immediately the leprosy le him, and he
was cleansed.
43 And He strictly warned him and sent
him away at once,
44 and said to him, "See that you say
nothing to anyone; but go your way,
show yourself to the priest, and oﬀer for
your cleansing those things which Moses
commanded, as a tes mony to them."MARK 1 – 2
8
45 However, he went out and began
to proclaim it freely, and to spread the
ma er, so that Jesus could no longer
openly enter the city, but was outside in
deserted places; and they came to Him
from every direc on.
1 And again He entered Capernaum
a er some days, and it was heard
that He was in the house.
2 Immediately many gathered together,
so that there was no longer room to
receive them, not even near the door.
And He preached the word to them.
3 Then they came to Him, bringing a
paraly c who was carried by four men.
4 And when they could not come
near Him because of the crowd, they
uncovered the roof where He was. So
when they had broken through, they let
down the bed on which the paraly c
was lying.
2MARK 2
9
5 When Jesus saw their faith, He said to
the paraly c, "Son, your sins are forgiven
you."
6 And some of the scribes were si ng
there and reasoning in their hearts,
7 "Why does this Man speak
blasphemies like this? Who can
forgive sins but God alone?"
8 But immediately, when Jesus
perceived in His spirit that they reasoned
thus within themselves, He said to them,
"Why do you reason about these things
in your hearts?
9 "Which is easier, to say to the
paraly c, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’
or to say, ‘Arise, take up your bed and
walk’?
10 "But that you may know that the Son
of Man has power on earth to forgive
sins" ––He said to the paraly c,
11 "I say to you, arise, take up your bed,
and go to your house."MARK 2
10
12 Immediately he arose, took up the
bed, and went out in the presence of
them all, so that all were amazed and
gloriﬁed God, saying, "We never saw
anything like this!"
13 Then He went out again by the sea;
and all the mul tude came to Him, and
He taught them.
14 As He passed by, He saw Levi the son
of Alphaeus si ng at the tax oﬃce. And
He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose
and followed Him.
15 Now it happened, as He was dining
in Levi’s house, that many tax collectors
and sinners also sat together with Jesus
and His disciples; for there were many,
and they followed Him.
16 And when the scribes and Pharisees
saw Him ea ng with the tax collectors
and sinners, they said to His disciples,
"How is it that He eats and drinks with
tax collectors and sinners?"MARK 2
11
17 When Jesus heard it, He said to
them, "Those who are well have no need
of a physician, but those who are sick. I
did not come to call the righteous, but
sinners, to repentance."
18 The disciples of John and of the
Pharisees were fas ng. Then they came
and said to Him, "Why do the disciples
of John and of the Pharisees fast, but
Your disciples do not fast?"
19 And Jesus said to them, "Can the
friends of the bridegroom fast while the
bridegroom is with them? As long as
they have the bridegroom with them
they cannot fast.
20 "But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from
them, and then they will fast in those
days.
21 "No one sews a piece of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment; or else the newMARK 2
12
piece pulls away from the old, and the
tear is made worse.
22 "And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins; or else the new wine bursts
the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and
the wineskins are ruined. But new wine
must be put into new wineskins."
23 Now it happened that He went
through the grainﬁelds on the Sabbath;
and as they went His disciples began to
pluck the heads of grain.
24 And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look,
why do they do what is not lawful on the
Sabbath?"
25 But He said to them, "Have you never
read what David did when he was in
need and hungry, he and those with him:
26 "how he went into the house of God
in the days of Abiathar the high priest,
and ate the showbread, which is not
lawful to eat, except for the priests, andMARK 2 – 3
13
also gave some to those who were with
him?"
27 And He said to them, "The Sabbath
was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath.
28 "Therefore the Son of Man is also
Lord of the Sabbath."
1 And He entered the synagogue
again, and a man was there who had
a withered hand.
2 So they watched Him closely, whether
He would heal him on the Sabbath, so
that they might accuse Him.
3 And He said to the man who had the
withered hand, "Step forward."
4 Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on
the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to
save life or to kill?" But they kept silent.
5 And when He had looked around at
them with anger, being grieved by the
hardness of their hearts, He said to
the man, "Stretch out your hand." And
3MARK 3
14
he stretched it out, and his hand was
restored as whole as the other.
6 Then the Pharisees went out and
immediately plo ed with the Herodians
against Him, how they might destroy
Him.
7 But Jesus withdrew with His disciples
to the sea. And a great mul tude from
Galilee followed Him, and from Judea
8 and Jerusalem and Idumea and
beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre
and Sidon, a great mul tude, when they
heard how many things He was doing,
came to Him.
9 So He told His disciples that a small
boat should be kept ready for Him
because of the mul tude, lest they
should crush Him.
10 For He healed many, so that as many
as had aﬄic ons pressed about Him to
touch Him.MARK 3
15
11 And the unclean spirits, whenever
they saw Him, fell down before Him and
cried out, saying, "You are the Son of
God."
12 But He sternly warned them that
they should not make Him known.
13 And He went up on the mountain and
called to Him those He Himself wanted.
And they came to Him.
14 Then He appointed twelve, that they
might be with Him and that He might
send them out to preach,
15 and to have power to heal sicknesses
and to cast out demons:
16 Simon, to whom He gave the name
Peter;
17 James the son of Zebedee and John
the brother of James, to whom He gave
the name Boanerges, that is, "Sons of
Thunder";
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Ma hew, Thomas, James the sonMARK 3
16
of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the
Cananite;
19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
Him. And they went into a house.
20 Then the mul tude came together
again, so that they could not so much as
eat bread.
21 But when His own people heard
about this, they went out to lay hold
of Him, for they said, "He is out of His
mind."
22 And the scribes who came down from
Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebub,"
and, "By the ruler of the demons He
casts out demons."
23 So He called them to Himself and
said to them in parables: "How can Satan
cast out Satan?
24 "If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand.
25 "And if a house is divided against
itself, that house cannot stand.MARK 3
17
26 "And if Satan has risen up against
himself, and is divided, he cannot stand,
but has an end.
27 "No one can enter a strong man’s
house and plunder his goods, unless he
ﬁrst binds the strong man. And then he
will plunder his house.
28 "Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be
forgiven the sons of men, and whatever
blasphemies they may u er;
29 "but he who blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is
subject to eternal condemna on" ––
30 because they said, "He has an
unclean spirit."
31 Then His brothers and His mother
came, and standing outside they sent to
Him, calling Him.
32 And a mul tude was si ng around
Him; and they said to Him, "Look, Your
mother and Your brothers are outside
seeking You."MARK 3 – 4
18
33 But He answered them, saying, "Who
is My mother, or My brothers?"
34 And He looked around in a circle
at those who sat about Him, and said,
"Here are My mother and My brothers!
35 "For whoever does the will of God is
My brother and My sister and mother."
1 And again He began to teach by
the sea. And a great mul tude was
gathered to Him, so that He got into a
boat and sat in it on the sea; and the
whole mul tude was on the land facing
the sea.
2 Then He taught them many things
by parables, and said to them in His
teaching:
3 "Listen! Behold, a sower went out to
sow.
4 "And it happened, as he sowed, that
some seed fell by the wayside; and the
birds of the air came and devoured it.
4MARK 4
19
5 "Some fell on stony ground, where
it did not have much earth; and
immediately it sprang up because it had
no depth of earth.
6 "But when the sun was up it was
scorched, and because it had no root it
withered away.
7 "And some seed fell among thorns;
and the thorns grew up and choked it,
and it yielded no crop.
8 "But other seed fell on good
ground and yielded a crop that sprang
up, increased and produced: some
thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a
hundred."
9 And He said to them, "He who has
ears to hear, let him hear!"
10 But when He was alone, those
around Him with the twelve asked Him
about the parable.
11 And He said to them, "To you it has
been given to know the mystery of theMARK 4
20
kingdom of God; but to those who are
outside, all things come in parables,
12 "so that ‘Seeing they may see and
not perceive, And hearing they may hear
and not understand; Lest they should
turn, And their sins be forgiven them.’"
13 And He said to them, "Do you not
understand this parable? How then will
you understand all the parables?
14 "The sower sows the word.
15 "And these are the ones by the
wayside where the word is sown. When
they hear, Satan comes immediately and
takes away the word that was sown in
their hearts.
16 "These likewise are the ones sown
on stony ground who, when they hear
the word, immediately receive it with
gladness;
17 "and they have no root in themselves,
and so endure only for a me. A erward,
when tribula on or persecu on arisesMARK 4
21
for the word’s sake, immediately they
stumble.
18 "Now these are the ones sown
among thorns; they are the ones who
hear the word,
19 "and the cares of this world, the
decei ulness of riches, and the desires
for other things entering in choke the
word, and it becomes unfrui ul.
20 "But these are the ones sown on
good ground, those who hear the word,
accept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold,
some sixty, and some a hundred."
21 Also He said to them, "Is a lamp
brought to be put under a basket or
under a bed? Is it not to be set on a
lampstand?
22 "For there is nothing hidden which
will not be revealed, nor has anything
been kept secret but that it should come
to light.MARK 4
22
23 "If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear."
24 Then He said to them, "Take heed
what you hear. With the same measure
you use, it will be measured to you; and
to you who hear, more will be given.
25 "For whoever has, to him more will
be given; but whoever does not have,
even what he has will be taken away
from him."
26 And He said, "The kingdom of God is
as if a man should sca er seed on the
ground,
27 "and should sleep by night and rise
by day, and the seed should sprout and
grow, he himself does not know how.
28 "For the earth yields crops by itself:
ﬁrst the blade, then the head, a er that
the full grain in the head.
29 "But when the grain ripens,
immediately he puts in the sickle,
because the harvest has come."MARK 4
23
30 Then He said, "To what shall we
liken the kingdom of God? Or with what
parable shall we picture it?
31 "It is like a mustard seed which, when
it is sown on the ground, is smaller than
all the seeds on earth;
32 "but when it is sown, it grows up
and becomes greater than all herbs,
and shoots out large branches, so that
the birds of the air may nest under its
shade."
33 And with many such parables He
spoke the word to them as they were
able to hear it.
34 But without a parable He did not
speak to them. And when they were
alone, He explained all things to His
disciples.
35 On the same day, when evening had
come, He said to them, "Let us cross
over to the other side."MARK 4
36 Now when they had le
24
the
mul tude, they took Him along in the
boat as He was. And other li le boats
were also with Him.
37 And a great windstorm arose, and
the waves beat into the boat, so that it
was already ﬁlling.
38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a
pillow. And they awoke Him and said to
Him, "Teacher, do You not care that we
are perishing?"
39 Then He arose and rebuked the wind,
and said to the sea, "Peace, be s ll!" And
the wind ceased and there was a great
calm.
40 But He said to them, "Why are you
so fearful? How is it that you have no
faith?"
41 And they feared exceedingly, and said
to one another, "Who can this be, that
even the wind and the sea obey Him!"MARK 5
5
25
1 Then they came to the other side
of the sea, to the country of the
Gadarenes.
2 And when He had come out of the
boat, immediately there met Him out of
the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
3 who had his dwelling among the
tombs; and no one could bind him, not
even with chains,
4 because he had o en been bound
with shackles and chains. And the chains
had been pulled apart by him, and the
shackles broken in pieces; neither could
anyone tame him.
5 And always, night and day, he was in
the mountains and in the tombs, crying
out and cu ng himself with stones.
6 When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran
and worshiped Him.
7 And he cried out with a loud voice and
said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus,MARK 5
26
Son of the Most High God? I implore You
by God that You do not torment me."
8 For He said to him, "Come out of the
man, unclean spirit!"
9 Then He asked him, "What is your
name?" And he answered, saying, "My
name is Legion; for we are many."
10 Also he begged Him earnestly that He
would not send them out of the country.
11 Now a large herd of swine was
feeding there near the mountains.
12 So all the demons begged Him,
saying, "Send us to the swine, that we
may enter them."
13 And at once Jesus gave them
permission. Then the unclean spirits
went out and entered the swine (there
were about two thousand); and the herd
ran violently down the steep place into
the sea, and drowned in the sea.
14 So those who fed the swine ﬂed, and
they told it in the city and in the country.MARK 5
27
And they went out to see what it was
that had happened.
15 Then they came to Jesus, and saw the
one who had been demon–possessed
and had the legion, si ng and clothed
and in his right mind. And they were
afraid.
16 And those who saw it told them
how it happened to him who had been
demon–possessed, and about the swine.
17 Then they began to plead with Him
to depart from their region.
18 And when He got into the boat,
he who had been demon–possessed
begged Him that he might be with Him.
19 However, Jesus did not permit him,
but said to him, "Go home to your
friends, and tell them what great things
the Lord has done for you, and how He
has had compassion on you."MARK 5
28
20 And he departed and began to
proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had
done for him; and all marveled.
21 Now when Jesus had crossed over
again by boat to the other side, a great
mul tude gathered to Him; and He was
by the sea.
22 And behold, one of the rulers of the
synagogue came, Jairus by name. And
when he saw Him, he fell at His feet
23 and begged Him earnestly, saying,
"My li le daughter lies at the point of
death. Come and lay Your hands on her,
that she may be healed, and she will
live."
24 So Jesus went with him, and a great
mul tude followed Him and thronged
Him.
25 Now a certain woman had a ﬂow of
blood for twelve years,
26 and had suﬀered many things from
many physicians. She had spent all thatMARK 5
29
she had and was no be er, but rather
grew worse.
27 When she heard about Jesus, she
came behind Him in the crowd and
touched His garment.
28 For she said, "If only I may touch His
clothes, I shall be made well."
29 Immediately the fountain of her
blood was dried up, and she felt in
her body that she was healed of the
aﬄic on.
30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in
Himself that power had gone out of Him,
turned around in the crowd and said,
"Who touched My clothes?"
31 But His disciples said to Him, "You
see the mul tude thronging You, and
You say, ‘Who touched Me?’"
32 And He looked around to see her
who had done this thing.
33 But the woman, fearing and
trembling, knowing what had happenedMARK 5
30
to her, came and fell down before Him
and told Him the whole truth.
34 And He said to her, "Daughter, your
faith has made you well. Go in peace,
and be healed of your aﬄic on."
35 While He was s ll speaking, some
came from the ruler of the synagogue’s
house who said, "Your daughter is dead.
Why trouble the Teacher any further?"
36 As soon as Jesus heard the word
that was spoken, He said to the ruler of
the synagogue, "Do not be afraid; only
believe."
37 And He permi ed no one to follow
Him except Peter, James, and John the
brother of James.
38 Then He came to the house of the
ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult
and those who wept and wailed loudly.
39 When He came in, He said to them,
"Why make this commo on and weep?
The child is not dead, but sleeping."MARK 5 – 6
31
40 And they ridiculed Him. But when He
had put them all outside, He took the
father and the mother of the child, and
those who were with Him, and entered
where the child was lying.
41 Then He took the child by the hand,
and said to her, "Talitha, cumi," which is
translated, "Li le girl, I say to you, arise."
42 Immediately the girl arose and
walked, for she was twelve years of age.
And they were overcome with great
amazement.
43 But He commanded them strictly
that no one should know it, and said that
something should be given her to eat.
1 Then He went out from there and
came to His own country, and His
disciples followed Him.
2 And when the Sabbath had come, He
began to teach in the synagogue. And
many hearing Him were astonished,
saying, "Where did this Man get these
6MARK 6
32
things? And what wisdom is this which
is given to Him, that such mighty works
are performed by His hands!
3 "Is this not the carpenter, the Son
of Mary, and brother of James, Joses,
Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters
here with us?" And they were oﬀended
at Him.
4 But Jesus said to them, "A prophet
is not without honor except in his own
country, among his own rela ves, and in
his own house."
5 Now He could do no mighty work
there, except that He laid His hands on a
few sick people and healed them.
6 And He marveled because of their
unbelief. Then He went about the
villages in a circuit, teaching.
7 And He called the twelve to Himself,
and began to send them out two by
two, and gave them power over unclean
spirits.MARK 6

8 He commanded them to take nothing
for the journey except a staﬀ––no bag,
no bread, no copper in their money
belts––
9 but to wear sandals, and not to put on
two tunics.
10 Also He said to them, "In whatever
place you enter a house, stay there ll
you depart from that place.
11 "And whoever will not receive you
nor hear you, when you depart from
there, shake oﬀ the dust under your feet
as a tes mony against them. Assuredly,
I say to you, it will be more tolerable
for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for that city!"
12 So they went out and preached that
people should repent.
13 And they cast out many demons, and
anointed with oil many who were sick,
and healed them.MARK 6
34
14 Now King Herod heard of Him, for His
name had become well known. And he
said, "John the Bap st is risen from the
dead, and therefore these powers are at
work in him."
15 Others said, "It is Elijah." And others
said, "It is the Prophet, or like one of the
prophets."
16 But when Herod heard, he said, "This
is John, whom I beheaded; he has been
raised from the dead!"
17 For Herod himself had sent and laid
hold of John, and bound him in prison
for the sake of Herodias, his brother
Philip’s wife; for he had married her.
18 For John had said to Herod, "It is not
lawful for you to have your brother’s
wife."
19 Therefore Herodias held it against
him and wanted to kill him, but she
could not;MARK 6
35
20 for Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a just and holy man, and
he protected him. And when he heard
him, he did many things, and heard him
gladly.
21 Then an opportune day came when
Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his
nobles, the high oﬃcers, and the chief
men of Galilee.
22 And when Herodias’ daughter herself
came in and danced, and pleased Herod
and those who sat with him, the king
said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you
want, and I will give it to you."
23 He also swore to her, "Whatever you
ask me, I will give you, up to half of my
kingdom."
24 So she went out and said to her
mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said,
"The head of John the Bap st!"
25 Immediately she came in with haste
to the king and asked, saying, "I wantMARK 6
36
you to give me at once the head of John
the Bap st on a pla er."
26 And the king was exceedingly sorry;
yet, because of the oaths and because of
those who sat with him, he did not want
to refuse her.
27 Immediately the king sent an
execu oner and commanded his head to
be brought. And he went and beheaded
him in prison,
28 brought his head on a pla er, and
gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to
her mother.
29 When his disciples heard of it, they
came and took away his corpse and laid
it in a tomb.
30 Then the apostles gathered to Jesus
and told Him all things, both what they
had done and what they had taught.
31 And He said to them, "Come aside by
yourselves to a deserted place and rest a
while." For there were many coming andMARK 6
37
going, and they did not even have me
to eat.
32 So they departed to a deserted place
in the boat by themselves.
33 But the mul tudes saw them
depar ng, and many knew Him and ran
there on foot from all the ci es. They
arrived before them and came together
to Him.
34 And Jesus, when He came out, saw
a great mul tude and was moved with
compassion for them, because they
were like sheep not having a shepherd.
So He began to teach them many things.
35 When the day was now far spent, His
disciples came to Him and said, "This is a
deserted place, and already the hour is
late.
36 "Send them away, that they may go
into the surrounding country and villages
and buy themselves bread; for they have
nothing to eat."MARK 6
38
37 But He answered and said to them,
"You give them something to eat." And
they said to Him, "Shall we go and buy
two hundred denarii worth of bread and
give them something to eat?"
38 But He said to them, "How many
loaves do you have? Go and see." And
when they found out they said, "Five,
and two ﬁsh."
39 Then He commanded them to make
them all sit down in groups on the green
grass.
40 So they sat down in ranks, in
hundreds and in ﬁ ies.
41 And when He had taken the ﬁve
loaves and the two ﬁsh, He looked up to
heaven, blessed and broke the loaves,
and gave them to His disciples to set
before them; and the two ﬁsh He divided
among them all.
42 So they all ate and were ﬁlled.MARK 6
39
43 And they took up twelve baskets full
of fragments and of the ﬁsh.
44 Now those who had eaten the loaves
were about ﬁve thousand men.
45 Immediately He made His disciples
get into the boat and go before Him to
the other side, to Bethsaida, while He
sent the mul tude away.
46 And when He had sent them away,
He departed to the mountain to pray.
47 Now when evening came, the boat
was in the middle of the sea; and He was
alone on the land.
48 Then He saw them straining at
rowing, for the wind was against them.
Now about the fourth watch of the night
He came to them, walking on the sea,
and would have passed them by.
49 And when they saw Him walking on
the sea, they supposed it was a ghost,
and cried out;MARK 6
40
50 for they all saw Him and were
troubled. But immediately He talked
with them and said to them, "Be of good
cheer! It is I; do not be afraid."
51 Then He went up into the boat to
them, and the wind ceased. And they
were greatly amazed in themselves
beyond measure, and marveled.
52 For they had not understood about
the loaves, because their heart was
hardened.
53 When they had crossed over, they
came to the land of Gennesaret and
anchored there.
54 And when they came out of the boat,
immediately the people recognized Him,
55 ran through that whole surrounding
region, and began to carry about on
beds those who were sick to wherever
they heard He was.
56 Wherever He entered into villages,
ci es, or in the country, they laid theMARK 7
41
sick in the marketplaces, and begged
Him that they might just touch the hem
of His garment. And as many as touched
Him were made well.
1 Then the Pharisees and some of
the scribes came together to Him,
having come from Jerusalem.
2 Now when they saw some of His
disciples eat bread with deﬁled, that is,
with unwashed hands, they found fault.
3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do
not eat unless they wash their hands in a
special way, holding the tradi on of the
elders.
4 When they come from the
marketplace, they do not eat unless they
wash. And there are many other things
which they have received and hold, like
the washing of cups, pitchers, copper
vessels, and couches.
5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked
Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk
7MARK 7
42
according to the tradi on of the elders,
but eat bread with unwashed hands?"
6 He answered and said to them, "Well
did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,
as it is wri en: ‘This people honors Me
with their lips, But their heart is far from
Me.
7 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching
as doctrines the commandments of
men.’
8 "For laying aside the commandment
of God, you hold the tradi on of
men––the washing of pitchers and cups,
and many other such things you do."
9 He said to them, "All too well you
reject the commandment of God, that
you may keep your tradi on.
10 "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father
and your mother’; and, ‘He who curses
father or mother, let him be put to
death.’MARK 7
43
11 "But you say, ‘If a man says to his
father or mother, "Whatever proﬁt you
might have received from me is Corban"
––’(that is, a gi to God),
12 "then you no longer let him do
anything for his father or his mother,
13 "making the word of God of no eﬀect
through your tradi on which you have
handed down. And many such things
you do."
14 When He had called all the mul tude
to Himself, He said to them, "Hear Me,
everyone, and understand:
15 "There is nothing that enters a man
from outside which can deﬁle him; but
the things which come out of him, those
are the things that deﬁle a man.
16 "If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear!"
17 When He had entered a house away
from the crowd, His disciples asked Him
concerning the parable.MARK 7
44
18 So He said to them, "Are you thus
without understanding also? Do you not
perceive that whatever enters a man
from outside cannot deﬁle him,
19 "because it does not enter his heart
but his stomach, and is eliminated, thus
purifying all foods?"
20 And He said, "What comes out of a
man, that deﬁles a man.
21 "For from within, out of the heart of
men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries,
fornica ons, murders,
22 "the s, covetousness, wickedness,
deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy,
pride, foolishness.
23 "All these evil things come from
within and deﬁle a man."
24 From there He arose and went to
the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He
entered a house and wanted no one to
know it, but He could not be hidden.MARK 7
45
25 For a woman whose young daughter
had an unclean spirit heard about Him,
and she came and fell at His feet.
26 The woman was a Greek, a Syro–
Phoenician by birth, and she kept asking
Him to cast the demon out of her
daughter.
27 But Jesus said to her, "Let the children
be ﬁlled ﬁrst, for it is not good to take
the children’s bread and throw it to the
li le dogs."
28 And she answered and said to Him,
"Yes, Lord, yet even the li le dogs
under the table eat from the children’s
crumbs."
29 Then He said to her, "For this saying
go your way; the demon has gone out of
your daughter."
30 And when she had come to her
house, she found the demon gone out,
and her daughter lying on the bed.MARK 7
31 Again, depar
46
ng from the region of
Tyre and Sidon, He came through the
midst of the region of Decapolis to the
Sea of Galilee.
32 Then they brought to Him one who
was deaf and had an impediment in his
speech, and they begged Him to put His
hand on him.
33 And He took him aside from the
mul tude, and put His ﬁngers in his ears,
and He spat and touched his tongue.
34 Then, looking up to heaven, He
sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha,"
that is, "Be opened."
35 Immediately his ears were opened,
and the impediment of his tongue was
loosed, and he spoke plainly.
36 Then He commanded them that they
should tell no one; but the more He
commanded them, the more widely they
proclaimed it.MARK 7 – 8
47
37 And they were astonished beyond
measure, saying, "He has done all things
well. He makes both the deaf to hear
and the mute to speak."
1 In those days, the mul tude being
very great and having nothing to eat,
Jesus called His disciples to Him and said
to them,
2 "I have compassion on the mul tude,
because they have now con nued with
Me three days and have nothing to eat.
3 "And if I send them away hungry to
their own houses, they will faint on the
way; for some of them have come from
afar."
4 Then His disciples answered Him,
"How can one sa sfy these people with
bread here in the wilderness?"
5 He asked them, "How many loaves do
you have?" And they said, "Seven."
6 So He commanded the mul tude to
sit down on the ground. And He took
8MARK 8
48
the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke
them and gave them to His disciples
to set before them; and they set them
before the mul tude.
7 They also had a few small ﬁsh; and
having blessed them, He said to set them
also before them.
8 So they ate and were ﬁlled, and they
took up seven large baskets of le over
fragments.
9 Now those who had eaten were about
four thousand. And He sent them away,
10 immediately got into the boat with
His disciples, and came to the region of
Dalmanutha.
11 Then the Pharisees came out and
began to dispute with Him, seeking from
Him a sign from heaven, tes ng Him.
12 But He sighed deeply in His spirit,
and said, "Why does this genera on
seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, no
sign shall be given to this genera on."MARK 8
13 And He le
49
them, and ge ng into
the boat again, departed to the other
side.
14 Now the disciples had forgo en to
take bread, and they did not have more
than one loaf with them in the boat.
15 Then He charged them, saying,
"Take heed, beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
16 And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, "It is because we
have no bread."
17 But Jesus, being aware of it, said
to them, "Why do you reason because
you have no bread? Do you not yet
perceive nor understand? Is your heart
s ll hardened?
18 "Having eyes, do you not see? And
having ears, do you not hear? And do
you not remember?
19 "When I broke the ﬁve loaves for the
ﬁve thousand, how many baskets full ofMARK 8
50
fragments did you take up?" They said to
Him, "Twelve."
20 "Also, when I broke the seven for the
four thousand, how many large baskets
full of fragments did you take up?" And
they said, "Seven."
21 So He said to them, "How is it you do
not understand?"
22 Then He came to Bethsaida; and they
brought a blind man to Him, and begged
Him to touch him.
23 So He took the blind man by the
hand and led him out of the town. And
when He had spit on his eyes and put His
hands on him, He asked him if he saw
anything.
24 And he looked up and said, "I see
men like trees, walking."
25 Then He put His hands on his eyes
again and made him look up. And he was
restored and saw everyone clearly.MARK 8
51
26 Then He sent him away to his house,
saying, "Neither go into the town, nor
tell anyone in the town."
27 Now Jesus and His disciples went out
to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on
the road He asked His disciples, saying to
them, "Who do men say that I am?"
28 So they answered, "John the Bap st;
but some say, Elijah; and others, one of
the prophets."
29 He said to them, "But who do you say
that I am?" Peter answered and said to
Him, "You are the Christ."
30 Then He strictly warned them that
they should tell no one about Him.
31 And He began to teach them that the
Son of Man must suﬀer many things,
and be rejected by the elders and chief
priests and scribes, and be killed, and
a er three days rise again.MARK 8
52
32 He spoke this word openly. And Peter
took Him aside and began to rebuke
Him.
33 But when He had turned around and
looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter,
saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you
are not mindful of the things of God, but
the things of men."
34 When He had called the people to
Himself, with His disciples also, He said
to them, "Whoever desires to come a er
Me, let him deny himself, and take up
his cross, and follow Me.
35 "For whoever desires to save his life
will lose it, but whoever loses his life for
My sake and the gospel’s will save it.
36 "For what will it proﬁt a man if he
gains the whole world, and loses his own
soul?
37 "Or what will a man give in exchange
for his soul?MARK 8 – 9
53
38 "For whoever is ashamed of Me and
My words in this adulterous and sinful
genera on, of him the Son of Man also
will be ashamed when He comes in the
glory of His Father with the holy angels."
1 And He said to them, "Assuredly,
I say to you that there are some
standing here who will not taste death
ll they see the kingdom of God present
with power."
2 Now a er six days Jesus took Peter,
James, and John, and led them up on a
high mountain apart by themselves; and
He was transﬁgured before them.
3 His clothes became shining,
exceedingly white, like snow, such as no
launderer on earth can whiten them.
4 And Elijah appeared to them with
Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
5 Then Peter answered and said to
Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be
here; and let us make three tabernacles:
9MARK 9
54
one for You, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah" ––
6 because he did not know what to say,
for they were greatly afraid.
7 And a cloud came and overshadowed
them; and a voice came out of the cloud,
saying, "This is My beloved Son. Hear
Him!"
8 Suddenly, when they had looked
around, they saw no one anymore, but
only Jesus with themselves.
9 Now as they came down from the
mountain, He commanded them that
they should tell no one the things they
had seen, ll the Son of Man had risen
from the dead.
10 So they kept this word to themselves,
ques oning what the rising from the
dead meant.
11 And they asked Him, saying, "Why
do the scribes say that Elijah must come
ﬁrst?"MARK 9
55
12 Then He answered and told them,
"Indeed, Elijah is coming ﬁrst and
restores all things. And how is it wri en
concerning the Son of Man, that He
must suﬀer many things and be treated
with contempt?
13 "But I say to you that Elijah has also
come, and they did to him whatever
they wished, as it is wri en of him."
14 And when He came to the disciples,
He saw a great mul tude around them,
and scribes dispu ng with them.
15 Immediately, when they saw Him, all
the people were greatly amazed, and
running to Him, greeted Him.
16 And He asked the scribes, "What are
you discussing with them?"
17 Then one of the crowd answered and
said, "Teacher, I brought You my son,
who has a mute spirit.
18 "And wherever it seizes him, it
throws him down; he foams at theMARK 9
56
mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes
rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that
they should cast it out, but they could
not."
19 He answered him and said, "O
faithless genera on, how long shall I be
with you? How long shall I bear with
you? Bring him to Me."
20 Then they brought him to Him. And
when he saw Him, immediately the spirit
convulsed him, and he fell on the ground
and wallowed, foaming at the mouth.
21 So He asked his father, "How long has
this been happening to him?" And he
said, "From childhood.
22 "And o en he has thrown him both
into the ﬁre and into the water to
destroy him. But if You can do anything,
have compassion on us and help us."
23 Jesus said to him, "If you can believe,
all things are possible to him who
believes."MARK 9
57
24 Immediately the father of the child
cried out and said with tears, "Lord, I
believe; help my unbelief!"
25 When Jesus saw that the people
came running together, He rebuked the
unclean spirit, saying to it, "Deaf and
dumb spirit, I command you, come out
of him and enter him no more!"
26 Then the spirit cried out, convulsed
him greatly, and came out of him. And
he became as one dead, so that many
said, "He is dead."
27 But Jesus took him by the hand and
li ed him up, and he arose.
28 And when He had come into the
house, His disciples asked Him privately,
"Why could we not cast it out?"
29 So He said to them, "This kind can
come out by nothing but prayer and
fas ng."MARK 9
58
30 Then they departed from there and
passed through Galilee, and He did not
want anyone to know it.
31 For He taught His disciples and said to
them, "The Son of Man is being betrayed
into the hands of men, and they will kill
Him. And a er He is killed, He will rise
the third day."
32 But they did not understand this
saying, and were afraid to ask Him.
33 Then He came to Capernaum. And
when He was in the house He asked
them, "What was it you disputed among
yourselves on the road?"
34 But they kept silent, for on the road
they had disputed among themselves
who would be the greatest.
35 And He sat down, called the twelve,
and said to them, "If anyone desires to
be ﬁrst, he shall be last of all and servant
of all."MARK 9
36 Then He took a li
59
le child and set him
in the midst of them. And when He had
taken him in His arms, He said to them,
37 "Whoever receives one of these li le
children in My name receives Me; and
whoever receives Me, receives not Me
but Him who sent Me."
38 Now John answered Him, saying,
"Teacher, we saw someone who does
not follow us cas ng out demons in Your
name, and we forbade him because he
does not follow us."
39 But Jesus said, "Do not forbid him,
for no one who works a miracle in My
name can soon a erward speak evil of
Me.
40 "For he who is not against us is on
our side.
41 "For whoever gives you a cup of
water to drink in My name, because you
belong to Christ, assuredly, I say to you,
he will by no means lose his reward.MARK 9
60
42 "But whoever causes one of these
li le ones who believe in Me to stumble,
it would be be er for him if a millstone
were hung around his neck, and he were
thrown into the sea.
43 "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it
oﬀ. It is be er for you to enter into life
maimed, rather than having two hands,
to go to hell, into the ﬁre that shall never
be quenched––
44 "where ‘Their worm does not die,
And the ﬁre is not quenched.’
45 "And if your foot causes you to sin,
cut it oﬀ. It is be er for you to enter life
lame, rather than having two feet, to
be cast into hell, into the ﬁre that shall
never be quenched––
46 "where ‘Their worm does not die,
And the ﬁre is not quenched.’
47 "And if your eye causes you to sin,
pluck it out. It is be er for you to enter
the kingdom of God with one eye, ratherMARK 9 – 10
61
than having two eyes, to be cast into hell
ﬁre––
48 "where ‘Their worm does not die,
And the ﬁre is not quenched.’
49 "For everyone will be seasoned with
ﬁre, and every sacriﬁce will be seasoned
with salt.
50 "Salt is good, but if the salt loses its
ﬂavor, how will you season it? Have salt
in yourselves, and have peace with one
another."
1 Then He arose from there and
came to the region of Judea
by the other side of the Jordan. And
mul tudes gathered to Him again, and
as He was accustomed, He taught them
again.
2 The Pharisees came and asked Him,
"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his
wife?" tes ng Him.
3 And He answered and said to them,
"What did Moses command you?"
10MARK 10
4 They said, "Moses permi
62
ed a man
to write a cer ﬁcate of divorce, and to
dismiss her."
5 And Jesus answered and said to them,
"Because of the hardness of your heart
he wrote you this precept.
6 "But from the beginning of the
crea on, God ‘made them male and
female.’
7 ‘For this reason a man shall leave his
father and mother and be joined to his
wife,
8 ‘and the two shall become one ﬂesh’;
so then they are no longer two, but one
ﬂesh.
9 "Therefore what God has joined
together, let not man separate."
10 In the house His disciples also asked
Him again about the same ma er.
11 So He said to them, "Whoever
divorces his wife and marries another
commits adultery against her.MARK 10
63
12 "And if a woman divorces her
husband and marries another, she
commits adultery."
13 Then they brought li le children to
Him, that He might touch them; but the
disciples rebuked those who brought
them.
14 But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly
displeased and said to them, "Let the
li le children come to Me, and do not
forbid them; for of such is the kingdom
of God.
15 "Assuredly, I say to you, whoever
does not receive the kingdom of God as
a li le child will by no means enter it."
16 And He took them up in His arms, put
His hands on them, and blessed them.
17 Now as He was going out on the
road, one came running, knelt before
Him, and asked Him, "Good Teacher,
what shall I do that I may inherit eternal
life?"MARK 10
64
18 So Jesus said to him, "Why do you
call Me good? No one is good but One,
that is, God.
19 "You know the commandments: ‘Do
not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’
‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’
‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and
your mother.’"
20 And he answered and said to Him,
"Teacher, all these things I have kept
from my youth."
21 Then Jesus, looking at him, loved
him, and said to him, "One thing you
lack: Go your way, sell whatever you
have and give to the poor, and you will
have treasure in heaven; and come, take
up the cross, and follow Me."
22 But he was sad at this word, and
went away sorrowful, for he had great
possessions.
23 Then Jesus looked around and said
to His disciples, "How hard it is for thoseMARK 10
65
who have riches to enter the kingdom of
God!"
24 And the disciples were astonished at
His words. But Jesus answered again and
said to them, "Children, how hard it is
for those who trust in riches to enter the
kingdom of God!
25 "It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of God."
26 And they were greatly astonished,
saying among themselves, "Who then
can be saved?"
27 But Jesus looked at them and said,
"With men it is impossible, but not
with God; for with God all things are
possible."
28 Then Peter began to say to Him, "See,
we have le all and followed You."
29 So Jesus answered and said,
"Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one
who has le house or brothers or sistersMARK 10
66
or father or mother or wife or children
or lands, for My sake and the gospel’s,
30 "who shall not receive a hundredfold
now in this me––houses and brothers
and sisters and mothers and children
and lands, with persecu ons––and in
the age to come, eternal life.
31 "But many who are ﬁrst will be last,
and the last ﬁrst."
32 Now they were on the road, going
up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going
before them; and they were amazed.
And as they followed they were afraid.
Then He took the twelve aside again and
began to tell them the things that would
happen to Him:
33 "Behold, we are going up to
Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be
betrayed to the chief priests and to the
scribes; and they will condemn Him to
death and deliver Him to the Gen les;MARK 10
67
34 "and they will mock Him, and scourge
Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And
the third day He will rise again."
35 Then James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, came to Him, saying, "Teacher,
we want You to do for us whatever we
ask."
36 And He said to them, "What do you
want Me to do for you?"
37 They said to Him, "Grant us that we
may sit, one on Your right hand and the
other on Your le , in Your glory."
38 But Jesus said to them, "You do not
know what you ask. Are you able to drink
the cup that I drink, and be bap zed with
the bap sm that I am bap zed with?"
39 They said to Him, "We are able." So
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed
drink the cup that I drink, and with the
bap sm I am bap zed with you will be
bap zed;MARK 10
68
40 "but to sit on My right hand and on
My le is not Mine to give, but it is for
those for whom it is prepared."
41 And when the ten heard it, they
began to be greatly displeased with
James and John.
42 But Jesus called them to Himself and
said to them, "You know that those who
are considered rulers over the Gen les
lord it over them, and their great ones
exercise authority over them.
43 "Yet it shall not be so among you; but
whoever desires to become great among
you shall be your servant.
44 "And whoever of you desires to be
ﬁrst shall be slave of all.
45 "For even the Son of Man did not
come to be served, but to serve, and to
give His life a ransom for many."
46 Now they came to Jericho. As He
went out of Jericho with His disciples
and a great mul tude, blind Bar maeus,MARK 10
69
the son of Timaeus, sat by the road
begging.
47 And when he heard that it was Jesus
of Nazareth, he began to cry out and
say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on
me!"
48 Then many warned him to be quiet;
but he cried out all the more, "Son of
David, have mercy on me!"
49 So Jesus stood s ll and commanded
him to be called. Then they called the
blind man, saying to him, "Be of good
cheer. Rise, He is calling you."
50 And throwing aside his garment, he
rose and came to Jesus.
51 So Jesus answered and said to him,
"What do you want Me to do for you?"
The blind man said to Him, "Rabboni,
that I may receive my sight."
52 Then Jesus said to him, "Go your
way; your faith has made you well." AndMARK 11
70
immediately he received his sight and
followed Jesus on the road.
1 Now when they drew near
Jerusalem, to Bethphage and
Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent
two of His disciples;
2 and He said to them, "Go into the
village opposite you; and as soon as you
have entered it you will ﬁnd a colt ed,
on which no one has sat. Loose it and
bring it.
3 "And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are
you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need
of it,’ and immediately he will send it
here."
4 So they went their way, and found
the colt ed by the door outside on the
street, and they loosed it.
5 But some of those who stood there
said to them, "What are you doing,
loosing the colt?"
11MARK 11
71
6 And they spoke to them just as Jesus
had commanded. So they let them go.
7 Then they brought the colt to Jesus
and threw their clothes on it, and He sat
on it.
8 And many spread their clothes on
the road, and others cut down leafy
branches from the trees and spread
them on the road.
9 Then those who went before and
those who followed cried out, saying:
"Hosanna! ‘Blessed is He who comes in
the name of the LORD!’
10 Blessed is the kingdom of our father
David That comes in the name of the
Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
11 And Jesus went into Jerusalem and
into the temple. So when He had looked
around at all things, as the hour was
already late, He went out to Bethany
with the twelve.MARK 11
72
12 Now the next day, when they had
come out from Bethany, He was hungry.
13 And seeing from afar a ﬁg tree having
leaves, He went to see if perhaps He
would ﬁnd something on it. When He
came to it, He found nothing but leaves,
for it was not the season for ﬁgs.
14 In response Jesus said to it, "Let no
one eat fruit from you ever again." And
His disciples heard it.
15 So they came to Jerusalem. Then
Jesus went into the temple and began to
drive out those who bought and sold in
the temple, and overturned the tables
of the money changers and the seats of
those who sold doves.
16 And He would not allow anyone to
carry wares through the temple.
17 Then He taught, saying to them, "Is it
not wri en, ‘My house shall be called a
house of prayer for all na ons’? But you
have made it a ‘den of thieves.’"MARK 11
73
18 And the scribes and chief priests
heard it and sought how they might
destroy Him; for they feared Him,
because all the people were astonished
at His teaching.
19 When evening had come, He went
out of the city.
20 Now in the morning, as they passed
by, they saw the ﬁg tree dried up from
the roots.
21 And Peter, remembering, said to
Him, "Rabbi, look! The ﬁg tree which You
cursed has withered away."
22 So Jesus answered and said to them,
"Have faith in God.
23 "For assuredly, I say to you, whoever
says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and
be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt
in his heart, but believes that those
things he says will be done, he will have
whatever he says.MARK 11
74
24 "Therefore I say to you, whatever
things you ask when you pray, believe
that you receive them, and you will have
them.
25 "And whenever you stand praying,
if you have anything against anyone,
forgive him, that your Father in heaven
may also forgive you your trespasses.
26 "But if you do not forgive, neither
will your Father in heaven forgive your
trespasses."
27 Then they came again to Jerusalem.
And as He was walking in the temple,
the chief priests, the scribes, and the
elders came to Him.
28 And they said to Him, "By what
authority are You doing these things?
And who gave You this authority to do
these things?"
29 But Jesus answered and said to them,
"I also will ask you one ques on; thenMARK 11 – 12
75
answer Me, and I will tell you by what
authority I do these things:
30 "The bap sm of John––was it from
heaven or from men? Answer Me."
31 And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, "If we say, ‘From
heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you
not believe him?’
32 "But if we say, ‘From men’" ––they
feared the people, for all counted John
to have been a prophet indeed.
33 So they answered and said to Jesus,
"We do not know." And Jesus answered
and said to them, "Neither will I tell you
by what authority I do these things."
1 Then He began to speak to them
in parables: "A man planted a
vineyard and set a hedge around it,
dug a place for the wine vat and built a
tower. And he leased it to vinedressers
and went into a far country.
12MARK 12
2 "Now at vintage–
76
me he sent a
servant to the vinedressers, that he
might receive some of the fruit of the
vineyard from the vinedressers.
3 "And they took him and beat him and
sent him away empty–handed.
4 "Again he sent them another servant,
and at him they threw stones, wounded
him in the head, and sent him away
shamefully treated.
5 "And again he sent another, and him
they killed; and many others, bea ng
some and killing some.
6 "Therefore s ll having one son, his
beloved, he also sent him to them last,
saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
7 "But those vinedressers said among
themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let
us kill him, and the inheritance will be
ours.’
8 "So they took him and killed him and
cast him out of the vineyard.MARK 12
77
9 "Therefore what will the owner of the
vineyard do? He will come and destroy
the vinedressers, and give the vineyard
to others.
10 "Have you not even read this
Scripture: ‘The stone which the
builders rejected Has become the chief
cornerstone.
11 This was the LORD’S doing, And it is
marvelous in our eyes’?"
12 And they sought to lay hands on Him,
but feared the mul tude, for they knew
He had spoken the parable against them.
So they le Him and went away.
13 Then they sent to Him some of the
Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch
Him in His words.
14 When they had come, they said to
Him, "Teacher, we know that You are
true, and care about no one; for You do
not regard the person of men, but teachMARK 12
78
the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to
pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
15 "Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?"
But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to
them, "Why do you test Me? Bring Me a
denarius that I may see it."
16 So they brought it. And He said to
them, "Whose image and inscrip on is
this?" They said to Him, "Caesar’s."
17 And Jesus answered and said to
them, "Render to Caesar the things that
are Caesar’s, and to God the things that
are God’s." And they marveled at Him.
18 Then some Sadducees, who say there
is no resurrec on, came to Him; and
they asked Him, saying:
19 "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that
if a man’s brother dies, and leaves his
wife behind, and leaves no children, his
brother should take his wife and raise up
oﬀspring for his brother.MARK 12
79
20 "Now there were seven brothers.
The ﬁrst took a wife; and dying, he le
no oﬀspring.
21 "And the second took her, and he
died; nor did he leave any oﬀspring. And
the third likewise.
22 "So the seven had her and le no
oﬀspring. Last of all the woman died
also.
23 "Therefore, in the resurrec on, when
they rise, whose wife will she be? For all
seven had her as wife."
24 Jesus answered and said to them,
"Are you not therefore mistaken,
because you do not know the Scriptures
nor the power of God?
25 "For when they rise from the dead,
they neither marry nor are given in
marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
26 "But concerning the dead, that they
rise, have you not read in the book of
Moses, in the burning bush passage,MARK 12
80
how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob’?
27 "He is not the God of the dead, but
the God of the living. You are therefore
greatly mistaken."
28 Then one of the scribes came, and
having heard them reasoning together,
perceiving that He had answered them
well, asked Him, "Which is the ﬁrst
commandment of all?"
29 Jesus answered him, "The ﬁrst of all
the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel,
the LORD our God, the LORD is one.
30 ‘And you shall love the LORD your
God with all your heart, with all your
soul, with all your mind, and with all your
strength.’ This is the ﬁrst commandment.
31 "And the second, like it, is this: ‘You
shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
There is no other commandment greater
than these."MARK 12
81
32 So the scribe said to Him, "Well said,
Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for
there is one God, and there is no other
but He.
33 "And to love Him with all the heart,
with all the understanding, with all the
soul, and with all the strength, and to
love one’s neighbor as oneself, is more
than all the whole burnt oﬀerings and
sacriﬁces."
34 Now when Jesus saw that he
answered wisely, He said to him, "You
are not far from the kingdom of God."
But a er that no one dared ques on
Him.
35 Then Jesus answered and said, while
He taught in the temple, "How is it that
the scribes say that the Christ is the Son
of David?
36 "For David himself said by the Holy
Spirit: ‘The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit atMARK 12
82
My right hand, Till I make Your enemies
Your footstool."’
37 "Therefore David himself calls Him
‘Lord’; how is He then his Son?" And the
common people heard Him gladly.
38 Then He said to them in His teaching,
"Beware of the scribes, who desire to go
around in long robes, love gree ngs in
the marketplaces,
39 "the best seats in the synagogues,
and the best places at feasts,
40 "who devour widows’ houses, and
for a pretense make long prayers. These
will receive greater condemna on."
41 Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury
and saw how the people put money into
the treasury. And many who were rich
put in much.
42 Then one poor widow came and
threw in two mites, which make a
quadrans.MARK 12 – 13
83
43 So He called His disciples to Himself
and said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you
that this poor widow has put in more
than all those who have given to the
treasury;
44 "for they all put in out of their
abundance, but she out of her poverty
put in all that she had, her whole
livelihood."
1 Then as He went out of the
temple, one of His disciples said
to Him, "Teacher, see what manner of
stones and what buildings are here!"
2 And Jesus answered and said to him,
"Do you see these great buildings? Not
one stone shall be le upon another,
that shall not be thrown down."
3 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives
opposite the temple, Peter, James, John,
and Andrew asked Him privately,
13MARK 13
84
4 "Tell us, when will these things be?
And what will be the sign when all these
things will be fulﬁlled?"
5 And Jesus, answering them, began to
say: "Take heed that no one deceives
you.
6 "For many will come in My name,
saying, ‘I am He,’ and will deceive many.
7 "But when you hear of wars and
rumors of wars, do not be troubled; for
such things must happen, but the end is
not yet.
8 "For na on will rise against na on,
and kingdom against kingdom. And there
will be earthquakes in various places,
and there will be famines and troubles.
These are the beginnings of sorrows.
9 "But watch out for yourselves, for they
will deliver you up to councils, and you
will be beaten in the synagogues. You
will be brought before rulers and kings
for My sake, for a tes mony to them.MARK 13
85
10 "And the gospel must ﬁrst be
preached to all the na ons.
11 "But when they arrest you and deliver
you up, do not worry beforehand, or
premeditate what you will speak. But
whatever is given you in that hour, speak
that; for it is not you who speak, but the
Holy Spirit.
12 "Now brother will betray brother
to death, and a father his child; and
children will rise up against parents and
cause them to be put to death.
13 "And you will be hated by all for My
name’s sake. But he who endures to the
end shall be saved.
14 "So when you see the ‘abomina on
of desola on,’ spoken of by Daniel the
prophet, standing where it ought not"
(let the reader understand), "then let
those who are in Judea ﬂee to the
mountains.MARK 13
86
15 "Let him who is on the housetop not
go down into the house, nor enter to
take anything out of his house.
16 "And let him who is in the ﬁeld not
go back to get his clothes.
17 "But woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who are nursing babies in
those days!
18 "And pray that your ﬂight may not be
in winter.
19 "For in those days there will be
tribula on, such as has not been since
the beginning of the crea on which God
created un l this me, nor ever shall be.
20 "And unless the Lord had shortened
those days, no ﬂesh would be saved; but
for the elect’s sake, whom He chose, He
shortened the days.
21 "Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look,
here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, He is there!’
do not believe it.MARK 13
87
22 "For false christs and false prophets
will rise and show signs and wonders to
deceive, if possible, even the elect.
23 "But take heed; see, I have told you
all things beforehand.
24 "But in those days, a er that
tribula on, the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light;
25 "the stars of heaven will fall, and the
powers in the heavens will be shaken.
26 "Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds with great power
and glory.
27 "And then He will send His angels,
and gather together His elect from the
four winds, from the farthest part of
earth to the farthest part of heaven.
28 "Now learn this parable from the
ﬁg tree: When its branch has already
become tender, and puts forth leaves,
you know that summer is near.MARK 13
88
29 "So you also, when you see these
things happening, know that it is
near––at the doors!
30 "Assuredly, I say to you, this
genera on will by no means pass away
ll all these things take place.
31 "Heaven and earth will pass away,
but My words will by no means pass
away.
32 "But of that day and hour no one
knows, not even the angels in heaven,
nor the Son, but only the Father.
33 "Take heed, watch and pray; for you
do not know when the me is.
34 "It is like a man going to a far country,
who le his house and gave authority to
his servants, and to each his work, and
commanded the doorkeeper to watch.
35 "Watch therefore, for you do not
know when the master of the house is
coming––in the evening, at midnight,MARK 13 – 14
89
at the crowing of the rooster, or in the
morning––
36 "lest, coming suddenly, he ﬁnd you
sleeping.
37 "And what I say to you, I say to all:
Watch!"
1 A er two days it was the
Passover and the Feast of
Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests
and the scribes sought how they might
take Him by trickery and put Him to
death.
2 But they said, "Not during the feast,
lest there be an uproar of the people."
3 And being in Bethany at the house of
Simon the leper, as He sat at the table,
a woman came having an alabaster ﬂask
of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she
broke the ﬂask and poured it on His
head.
14MARK 14
90
4 But there were some who were
indignant among themselves, and said,
"Why was this fragrant oil wasted?
5 "For it might have been sold for more
than three hundred denarii and given
to the poor." And they cri cized her
sharply.
6 But Jesus said, "Let her alone. Why do
you trouble her? She has done a good
work for Me.
7 "For you have the poor with you
always, and whenever you wish you may
do them good; but Me you do not have
always.
8 "She has done what she could. She
has come beforehand to anoint My body
for burial.
9 "Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this
gospel is preached in the whole world,
what this woman has done will also be
told as a memorial to her."MARK 14
91
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the
twelve, went to the chief priests to
betray Him to them.
11 And when they heard it, they were
glad, and promised to give him money.
So he sought how he might conveniently
betray Him.
12 Now on the ﬁrst day of Unleavened
Bread, when they killed the Passover
lamb, His disciples said to Him, "Where
do You want us to go and prepare, that
You may eat the Passover?"
13 And He sent out two of His disciples
and said to them, "Go into the city, and a
man will meet you carrying a pitcher of
water; follow him.
14 "Wherever he goes in, say to the
master of the house, ‘The Teacher says,
"Where is the guest room in which I may
eat the Passover with My disciples?"’MARK 14
92
15 "Then he will show you a large upper
room, furnished and prepared; there
make ready for us."
16 So His disciples went out, and came
into the city, and found it just as He had
said to them; and they prepared the
Passover.
17 In the evening He came with the
twelve.
18 Now as they sat and ate, Jesus said,
"Assuredly, I say to you, one of you who
eats with Me will betray Me."
19 And they began to be sorrowful, and
to say to Him one by one, "Is it I?" And
another said, "Is it I?"
20 He answered and said to them, "It is
one of the twelve, who dips with Me in
the dish.
21 "The Son of Man indeed goes just as
it is wri en of Him, but woe to that man
by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! ItMARK 14
93
would have been good for that man if he
had never been born."
22 And as they were ea ng, Jesus took
bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it
to them and said, "Take, eat; this is My
body."
23 Then He took the cup, and when He
had given thanks He gave it to them, and
they all drank from it.
24 And He said to them, "This is My
blood of the new covenant, which is
shed for many.
25 "Assuredly, I say to you, I will no
longer drink of the fruit of the vine
un l that day when I drink it new in the
kingdom of God."
26 And when they had sung a hymn,
they went out to the Mount of Olives.
27 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you
will be made to stumble because of Me
this night, for it is wri en: ‘I will strikeMARK 14
94
the Shepherd, And the sheep will be
sca ered.’
28 "But a er I have been raised, I will go
before you to Galilee."
29 Peter said to Him, "Even if all are
made to stumble, yet I will not be."
30 Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I say to
you that today, even this night, before
the rooster crows twice, you will deny
Me three mes."
31 But he spoke more vehemently, "If
I have to die with You, I will not deny
You!" And they all said likewise.
32 Then they came to a place which was
named Gethsemane; and He said to His
disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
33 And He took Peter, James, and John
with Him, and He began to be troubled
and deeply distressed.
34 Then He said to them, "My soul is
exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
Stay here and watch."MARK 14
35 He went a li
95
le farther, and fell on
the ground, and prayed that if it were
possible, the hour might pass from Him.
36 And He said, "Abba, Father, all things
are possible for You. Take this cup away
from Me; nevertheless, not what I will,
but what You will."
37 Then He came and found them
sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are
you sleeping? Could you not watch one
hour?
38 "Watch and pray, lest you enter into
tempta on. The spirit indeed is willing,
but the ﬂesh is weak."
39 Again He went away and prayed, and
spoke the same words.
40 And when He returned, He found
them asleep again, for their eyes were
heavy; and they did not know what to
answer Him.
41 Then He came the third me and
said to them, "Are you s ll sleepingMARK 14
96
and res ng? It is enough! The hour has
come; behold, the Son of Man is being
betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 "Rise, let us be going. See, My
betrayer is at hand."
43 And immediately, while He was s ll
speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with
a great mul tude with swords and clubs,
came from the chief priests and the
scribes and the elders.
44 Now His betrayer had given them a
signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is
the One; seize Him and lead Him away
safely."
45 As soon as He had come, immediately
he went up to Him and said to Him,
"Rabbi, Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
46 Then they laid their hands on Him
and took Him.
47 And one of those who stood by drew
his sword and struck the servant of the
high priest, and cut oﬀ his ear.MARK 14
97
48 Then Jesus answered and said to
them, "Have you come out, as against
a robber, with swords and clubs to take
Me?
49 "I was daily with you in the temple
teaching, and you did not seize Me. But
the Scriptures must be fulﬁlled."
50 Then they all forsook Him and ﬂed.
51 Now a certain young man followed
Him, having a linen cloth thrown around
his naked body. And the young men laid
hold of him,
52 and he le the linen cloth and ﬂed
from them naked.
53 And they led Jesus away to the high
priest; and with him were assembled
all the chief priests, the elders, and the
scribes.
54 But Peter followed Him at a distance,
right into the courtyard of the high
priest. And he sat with the servants and
warmed himself at the ﬁre.MARK 14
98
55 Now the chief priests and all the
council sought tes mony against Jesus
to put Him to death, but found none.
56 For many bore false witness against
Him, but their tes monies did not agree.
57 Then some rose up and bore false
witness against Him, saying,
58 "We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy
this temple made with hands, and within
three days I will build another made
without hands.’"
59 But not even then did their tes mony
agree.
60 And the high priest stood up in the
midst and asked Jesus, saying, "Do You
answer nothing? What is it these men
tes fy against You?"
61 But He kept silent and answered
nothing. Again the high priest asked
Him, saying to Him, "Are You the Christ,
the Son of the Blessed?"MARK 14
99
62 Jesus said, "I am. And you will see the
Son of Man si ng at the right hand of
the Power, and coming with the clouds
of heaven."
63 Then the high priest tore his clothes
and said, "What further need do we
have of witnesses?
64 "You have heard the blasphemy!
What do you think?" And they all
condemned Him to be deserving of
death.
65 Then some began to spit on Him,
and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him,
and to say to Him, "Prophesy!" And the
oﬃcers struck Him with the palms of
their hands.
66 Now as Peter was below in the
courtyard, one of the servant girls of the
high priest came.
67 And when she saw Peter warming
himself, she looked at him and said, "You
also were with Jesus of Nazareth."MARK 14
100
68 But he denied it, saying, "I neither
know nor understand what you are
saying." And he went out on the porch,
and a rooster crowed.
69 And the servant girl saw him again,
and began to say to those who stood by,
"This is one of them."
70 But he denied it again. And a li le
later those who stood by said to Peter
again, "Surely you are one of them; for
you are a Galilean, and your speech
shows it."
71 Then he began to curse and swear,
"I do not know this Man of whom you
speak!"
72 A second me the rooster crowed.
Then Peter called to mind the word
that Jesus had said to him, "Before the
rooster crows twice, you will deny Me
three mes." And when he thought
about it, he wept.MARK 15
15
101
1 Immediately, in the morning, the
chief priests held a consulta on
with the elders and scribes and the
whole council; and they bound Jesus, led
Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.
2 Then Pilate asked Him, "Are You the
King of the Jews?" He answered and said
to him, "It is as you say."
3 And the chief priests accused Him of
many things, but He answered nothing.
4 Then Pilate asked Him again, saying,
"Do You answer nothing? See how many
things they tes fy against You!"
5 But Jesus s ll answered nothing, so
that Pilate marveled.
6 Now at the feast he was accustomed
to releasing one prisoner to them,
whomever they requested.
7 And there was one named Barabbas,
who was chained with his fellow rebels;
they had commi ed murder in the
rebellion.MARK 15
8 Then the mul
102
tude, crying aloud,
began to ask him to do just as he had
always done for them.
9 But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do
you want me to release to you the King
of the Jews?"
10 For he knew that the chief priests
had handed Him over because of envy.
11 But the chief priests s rred up the
crowd, so that he should rather release
Barabbas to them.
12 Pilate answered and said to them
again, "What then do you want me to do
with Him whom you call the King of the
Jews?"
13 So they cried out again, "Crucify
Him!"
14 Then Pilate said to them, "Why, what
evil has He done?" But they cried out all
the more, "Crucify Him!"
15 So Pilate, wan ng to gra fy the
crowd, released Barabbas to them; andMARK 15
103
he delivered Jesus, a er he had scourged
Him, to be cruciﬁed.
16 Then the soldiers led Him away into
the hall called Praetorium, and they
called together the whole garrison.
17 And they clothed Him with purple;
and they twisted a crown of thorns, put
it on His head,
18 and began to salute Him, "Hail, King
of the Jews!"
19 Then they struck Him on the head
with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing
the knee, they worshiped Him.
20 And when they had mocked Him,
they took the purple oﬀ Him, put His
own clothes on Him, and led Him out to
crucify Him.
21 Then they compelled a certain
man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of
Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming
out of the country and passing by, to
bear His cross.MARK 15
104
22 And they brought Him to the place
Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a
Skull.
23 Then they gave Him wine mingled
with myrrh to drink, but He did not take
it.
24 And when they cruciﬁed Him, they
divided His garments, cas ng lots for
them to determine what every man
should take.
25 Now it was the third hour, and they
cruciﬁed Him.
26 And the inscrip on of His accusa on
was wri en above: THE KING OF THE
JEWS.
27 With Him they also cruciﬁed two
robbers, one on His right and the other
on His le .
28 So the Scripture was fulﬁlled which
says, "And He was numbered with the
transgressors."MARK 15
105
29 And those who passed by
blasphemed Him, wagging their
heads and saying, "Aha! You who destroy
the temple and build it in three days,
30 "save Yourself, and come down from
the cross!"
31 Likewise the chief priests also,
mocking among themselves with the
scribes, said, "He saved others; Himself
He cannot save.
32 "Let the Christ, the King of Israel,
descend now from the cross, that we
may see and believe." Even those who
were cruciﬁed with Him reviled Him.
33 Now when the sixth hour had come,
there was darkness over the whole land
un l the ninth hour.
34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out
with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?" which is translated, "My
God, My God, why have You forsaken
Me?"MARK 15
106
35 Some of those who stood by, when
they heard that, said, "Look, He is calling
for Elijah!"
36 Then someone ran and ﬁlled a
sponge full of sour wine, put it on a reed,
and oﬀered it to Him to drink, saying,
"Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will
come to take Him down."
37 And Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
and breathed His last.
38 Then the veil of the temple was torn
in two from top to bo om.
39 So when the centurion, who stood
opposite Him, saw that He cried out like
this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly
this Man was the Son of God!"
40 There were also women looking on
from afar, among whom were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James
the Less and of Joses, and Salome,
41 who also followed Him and
ministered to Him when He was inMARK 15
107
Galilee, and many other women who
came up with Him to Jerusalem.
42 Now when evening had come,
because it was the Prepara on Day, that
is, the day before the Sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent
council member, who was himself
wai ng for the kingdom of God, coming
and taking courage, went in to Pilate and
asked for the body of Jesus.
44 Pilate marveled that He was already
dead; and summoning the centurion, he
asked him if He had been dead for some
me.
45 So when he found out from the
centurion, he granted the body to
Joseph.
46 Then he bought ﬁne linen, took Him
down, and wrapped Him in the linen.
And he laid Him in a tomb which had
been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a
stone against the door of the tomb.MARK 15 – 16
108
47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Joses observed where He was
laid.
1 Now when the Sabbath was
past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the
mother of James, and Salome bought
spices, that they might come and anoint
Him.
2 Very early in the morning, on the ﬁrst
day of the week, they came to the tomb
when the sun had risen.
3 And they said among themselves,
"Who will roll away the stone from the
door of the tomb for us?"
4 But when they looked up, they
saw that the stone had been rolled
away––for it was very large.
5 And entering the tomb, they saw a
young man clothed in a long white robe
si ng on the right side; and they were
alarmed.
16MARK 16
109
6 But he said to them, "Do not be
alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth,
who was cruciﬁed. He is risen! He is not
here. See the place where they laid Him.
7 "But go, tell His disciples––and
Peter––that He is going before you into
Galilee; there you will see Him, as He
said to you."
8 So they went out quickly and ﬂed
from the tomb, for they trembled and
were amazed. And they said nothing to
anyone, for they were afraid.
9 Now when He rose early on the ﬁrst
day of the week, He appeared ﬁrst to
Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had
cast seven demons.
10 She went and told those who had
been with Him, as they mourned and
wept.
11 And when they heard that He was
alive and had been seen by her, they did
not believe.MARK 16
12 A
110
er that, He appeared in another
form to two of them as they walked and
went into the country.
13 And they went and told it to the rest,
but they did not believe them either.
14 Later He appeared to the eleven as
they sat at the table; and He rebuked
their unbelief and hardness of heart,
because they did not believe those who
had seen Him a er He had risen.
15 And He said to them, "Go into all the
world and preach the gospel to every
creature.
16 "He who believes and is bap zed will
be saved; but he who does not believe
will be condemned.
17 "And these signs will follow those
who believe: In My name they will cast
out demons; they will speak with new
tongues;
18 "they will take up serpents; and if
they drink anything deadly, it will by noMARK 16
111
means hurt them; they will lay hands on
the sick, and they will recover."
19 So then, a er the Lord had spoken to
them, He was received up into heaven,
and sat down at the right hand of God.
20 And they went out and preached
everywhere, the Lord working with them
and conﬁrming the word through the
accompanying signs. Amen.Luke
1
1 Inasmuch as many have taken in
hand to set in order a narra ve of
those things which have been fulﬁlled
among us,
2 just as those who from the beginning
were eyewitnesses and ministers of the
word delivered them to us,
3 it seemed good to me also, having had
perfect understanding of all things from
the very ﬁrst, to write to you an orderly
account, most excellent Theophilus,
4 that you may know the certainty
of those things in which you were
instructed.
5 There was in the days of Herod, the
king of Judea, a certain priest named
Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. HisLUKE 1
2
wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and
her name was Elizabeth.
6 And they were both righteous before
God, walking in all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
7 But they had no child, because
Elizabeth was barren, and they were
both well advanced in years.
8 So it was, that while he was serving
as priest before God in the order of his
division,
9 according to the custom of the
priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense
when he went into the temple of the
Lord.
10 And the whole mul tude of the
people was praying outside at the hour
of incense.
11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared
to him, standing on the right side of the
altar of incense.LUKE 1
3
12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was
troubled, and fear fell upon him.
13 But the angel said to him, "Do not
be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is
heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear
you a son, and you shall call his name
John.
14 "And you will have joy and gladness,
and many will rejoice at his birth.
15 "For he will be great in the sight
of the Lord, and shall drink neither
wine nor strong drink. He will also be
ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit, even from his
mother’s womb.
16 "And he will turn many of the
children of Israel to the Lord their God.
17 "He will also go before Him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the
hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and
the disobedient to the wisdom of the
just, to make ready a people prepared
for the Lord."LUKE 1
4
18 And Zacharias said to the angel,
"How shall I know this? For I am an old
man, and my wife is well advanced in
years."
19 And the angel answered and said to
him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the
presence of God, and was sent to speak
to you and bring you these glad dings.
20 "But behold, you will be mute and
not able to speak un l the day these
things take place, because you did not
believe my words which will be fulﬁlled
in their own me."
21 And the people waited for Zacharias,
and marveled that he lingered so long in
the temple.
22 But when he came out, he could
not speak to them; and they perceived
that he had seen a vision in the temple,
for he beckoned to them and remained
speechless.LUKE 1
5
23 And so it was, as soon as the days
of his service were completed, that he
departed to his own house.
24 Now a er those days his wife
Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself
ﬁve months, saying,
25 "Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in
the days when He looked on me, to take
away my reproach among people."
26 Now in the sixth month the angel
Gabriel was sent by God to a city of
Galilee named Nazareth,
27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose
name was Joseph, of the house of David.
The virgin’s name was Mary.
28 And having come in, the angel said
to her, "Rejoice, highly favored one, the
Lord is with you; blessed are you among
women!"
29 But when she saw him, she was
troubled at his saying, and considered
what manner of gree ng this was.LUKE 1
6
30 Then the angel said to her, "Do not
be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor
with God.
31 "And behold, you will conceive in
your womb and bring forth a Son, and
shall call His name JESUS.
32 "He will be great, and will be called
the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God
will give Him the throne of His father
David.
33 "And He will reign over the house of
Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there
will be no end."
34 Then Mary said to the angel, "How
can this be, since I do not know a man?"
35 And the angel answered and said
to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon
you, and the power of the Highest will
overshadow you; therefore, also, that
Holy One who is to be born will be called
the Son of God.LUKE 1
36 "Now indeed, Elizabeth your rela
7
ve
has also conceived a son in her old age;
and this is now the sixth month for her
who was called barren.
37 "For with God nothing will be
impossible."
38 Then Mary said, "Behold the
maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me
according to your word." And the angel
departed from her.
39 Now Mary arose in those days and
went into the hill country with haste, to
a city of Judah,
40 and entered the house of Zacharias
and greeted Elizabeth.
41 And it happened, when Elizabeth
heard the gree ng of Mary, that the
babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth
was ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit.
42 Then she spoke out with a loud
voice and said, "Blessed are you amongLUKE 1
8
women, and blessed is the fruit of your
womb!
43 "But why is this granted to me, that
the mother of my Lord should come to
me?
44 "For indeed, as soon as the voice of
your gree ng sounded in my ears, the
babe leaped in my womb for joy.
45 "Blessed is she who believed, for
there will be a fulﬁllment of those things
which were told her from the Lord."
46 And Mary said: "My soul magniﬁes
the Lord,
47 And my spirit has rejoiced in God my
Savior.
48 For He has regarded the lowly state of
His maidservant; For behold, henceforth
all genera ons will call me blessed.
49 For He who is mighty has done great
things for me, And holy is His name.
50 And His mercy is on those who fear
Him From genera on to genera on.LUKE 1
51 He has shown strength with His
arm; He has sca ered the proud in the
imagina on of their hearts.
52 He has put down the mighty from
their thrones, And exalted the lowly.
53 He has ﬁlled the hungry with good
things, And the rich He has sent away
empty.
54 He has helped His servant Israel, In
remembrance of His mercy,
55 As He spoke to our fathers, To
Abraham and to his seed forever."
56 And Mary remained with her about
three months, and returned to her
house.
57 Now Elizabeth’s full me came for
her to be delivered, and she brought
forth a son.
58 When her neighbors and rela ves
heard how the Lord had shown great
mercy to her, they rejoiced with her.
9LUKE 1
10
59 So it was, on the eighth day, that they
came to circumcise the child; and they
would have called him by the name of
his father, Zacharias.
60 His mother answered and said, "No;
he shall be called John."
61 But they said to her, "There is no one
among your rela ves who is called by
this name."
62 So they made signs to his father––
what he would have him called.
63 And he asked for a wri ng tablet, and
wrote, saying, "His name is John." So
they all marveled.
64 Immediately his mouth was opened
and his tongue loosed, and he spoke,
praising God.
65 Then fear came on all who dwelt
around them; and all these sayings were
discussed throughout all the hill country
of Judea.LUKE 1
11
66 And all those who heard them kept
them in their hearts, saying, "What kind
of child will this be?" And the hand of
the Lord was with him.
67 Now his father Zacharias was ﬁlled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied,
saying:
68 "Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, For
He has visited and redeemed His people,
69 And has raised up a horn of salva on
for us In the house of His servant David,
70 As He spoke by the mouth of His
holy prophets, Who have been since the
world began,
71 That we should be saved from our
enemies And from the hand of all who
hate us,
72 To perform the mercy promised to
our fathers And to remember His holy
covenant,
73 The oath which He swore to our
father Abraham:LUKE 1 – 2
12
74 To grant us that we, Being delivered
from the hand of our enemies, Might
serve Him without fear,
75 In holiness and righteousness before
Him all the days of our life.
76 "And you, child, will be called the
prophet of the Highest; For you will go
before the face of the Lord to prepare
His ways,
77 To give knowledge of salva on to His
people By the remission of their sins,
78 Through the tender mercy of our
God, With which the Dayspring from on
high has visited us;
79 To give light to those who sit in
darkness and the shadow of death, To
guide our feet into the way of peace."
80 So the child grew and became strong
in spirit, and was in the deserts ll the
day of his manifesta on to Israel.
1 And it came to pass in those days
that a decree went out from Caesar
2LUKE 2
13
Augustus that all the world should be
registered.
2 This census ﬁrst took place while
Quirinius was governing Syria.
3 So all went to be registered, everyone
to his own city.
4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out
of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the
city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
because he was of the house and lineage
of David,
5 to be registered with Mary, his
betrothed wife, who was with child.
6 So it was, that while they were there,
the days were completed for her to be
delivered.
7 And she brought forth her ﬁrstborn
Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling
cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because
there was no room for them in the inn.LUKE 2
14
8 Now there were in the same country
shepherds living out in the ﬁelds,
keeping watch over their ﬂock by night.
9 And behold, an angel of the Lord
stood before them, and the glory of the
Lord shone around them, and they were
greatly afraid.
10 Then the angel said to them, "Do not
be afraid, for behold, I bring you good
dings of great joy which will be to all
people.
11 "For there is born to you this day in
the city of David a Savior, who is Christ
the Lord.
12 "And this will be the sign to you: You
will ﬁnd a Babe wrapped in swaddling
cloths, lying in a manger."
13 And suddenly there was with the
angel a mul tude of the heavenly host
praising God and saying:
14 "Glory to God in the highest, And on
earth peace, goodwill toward men!"LUKE 2
15
15 So it was, when the angels had gone
away from them into heaven, that the
shepherds said to one another, "Let us
now go to Bethlehem and see this thing
that has come to pass, which the Lord
has made known to us."
16 And they came with haste and found
Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in
a manger.
17 Now when they had seen Him, they
made widely known the saying which
was told them concerning this Child.
18 And all those who heard it marveled
at those things which were told them by
the shepherds.
19 But Mary kept all these things and
pondered them in her heart.
20 Then the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all the
things that they had heard and seen, as
it was told them.LUKE 2
16
21 And when eight days were completed
for the circumcision of the Child, His
name was called JESUS, the name given
by the angel before He was conceived in
the womb.
22 Now when the days of her
puriﬁca on according to the law of
Moses were completed, they brought
Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the
Lord
23 (as it is wri en in the law of the Lord,
"Every male who opens the womb shall
be called holy to the LORD"),
24 and to oﬀer a sacriﬁce according
to what is said in the law of the Lord,
"A pair of turtledoves or two young
pigeons."
25 And behold, there was a man in
Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and
this man was just and devout, wai ng
for the Consola on of Israel, and the
Holy Spirit was upon him.LUKE 2
17
26 And it had been revealed to him by
the Holy Spirit that he would not see
death before he had seen the Lord’s
Christ.
27 So he came by the Spirit into the
temple. And when the parents brought
in the Child Jesus, to do for Him
according to the custom of the law,
28 he took Him up in his arms and
blessed God and said:
29 "Lord, now You are le ng Your
servant depart in peace, According to
Your word;
30 For my eyes have seen Your salva on
31 Which You have prepared before the
face of all peoples,
32 A light to bring revela on to the
Gen les, And the glory of Your people
Israel."
33 And Joseph and His mother marveled
at those things which were spoken of
Him.LUKE 2
18
34 Then Simeon blessed them, and said
to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child
is des ned for the fall and rising of many
in Israel, and for a sign which will be
spoken against
35 "(yes, a sword will pierce through
your own soul also), that the thoughts of
many hearts may be revealed."
36 Now there was one, Anna, a
prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher. She was of a great
age, and had lived with a husband seven
years from her virginity;
37 and this woman was a widow of
about eighty–four years, who did not
depart from the temple, but served God
with fas ngs and prayers night and day.
38 And coming in that instant she gave
thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to
all those who looked for redemp on in
Jerusalem.LUKE 2
19
39 So when they had performed all
things according to the law of the Lord,
they returned to Galilee, to their own
city, Nazareth.
40 And the Child grew and became
strong in spirit, ﬁlled with wisdom; and
the grace of God was upon Him.
41 His parents went to Jerusalem every
year at the Feast of the Passover.
42 And when He was twelve years old,
they went up to Jerusalem according to
the custom of the feast.
43 When they had ﬁnished the days, as
they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered
behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His
mother did not know it;
44 but supposing Him to have been in
the company, they went a day’s journey,
and sought Him among their rela ves
and acquaintances.
45 So when they did not ﬁnd Him, they
returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.LUKE 2
46 Now so it was that a
20
er three days
they found Him in the temple, si ng in
the midst of the teachers, both listening
to them and asking them ques ons.
47 And all who heard Him were
astonished at His understanding and
answers.
48 So when they saw Him, they were
amazed; and His mother said to Him,
"Son, why have You done this to us?
Look, Your father and I have sought You
anxiously."
49 And He said to them, "Why did you
seek Me? Did you not know that I must
be about My Father’s business?"
50 But they did not understand the
statement which He spoke to them.
51 Then He went down with them and
came to Nazareth, and was subject to
them, but His mother kept all these
things in her heart.LUKE 2 – 3
21
52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature, and in favor with God and men.
1 Now in the ﬁ eenth year of the
reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pon us
Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod
being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother
Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region
of Trachoni s, and Lysanias tetrarch of
Abilene,
2 while Annas and Caiaphas were high
priests, the word of God came to John
the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
3 And he went into all the region around
the Jordan, preaching a bap sm of
repentance for the remission of sins,
4 as it is wri en in the book of the
words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: "The
voice of one crying in the wilderness:
‘Prepare the way of the LORD; Make His
paths straight.
5 Every valley shall be ﬁlled And every
mountain and hill brought low; The
3LUKE 3
22
crooked places shall be made straight
And the rough ways smooth;
6 And all ﬂesh shall see the salva on of
God.’"
7 Then he said to the mul tudes that
came out to be bap zed by him, "Brood
of vipers! Who warned you to ﬂee from
the wrath to come?
8 "Therefore bear fruits worthy of
repentance, and do not begin to say to
yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our
father.’ For I say to you that God is able
to raise up children to Abraham from
these stones.
9 "And even now the ax is laid to the
root of the trees. Therefore every tree
which does not bear good fruit is cut
down and thrown into the ﬁre."
10 So the people asked him, saying,
"What shall we do then?"
11 He answered and said to them, "He
who has two tunics, let him give to himLUKE 3
23
who has none; and he who has food, let
him do likewise."
12 Then tax collectors also came to be
bap zed, and said to him, "Teacher,
what shall we do?"
13 And he said to them, "Collect no
more than what is appointed for you."
14 Likewise the soldiers asked him,
saying, "And what shall we do?" So he
said to them, "Do not in midate anyone
or accuse falsely, and be content with
your wages."
15 Now as the people were in
expecta on, and all reasoned in their
hearts about John, whether he was the
Christ or not,
16 John answered, saying to all, "I
indeed bap ze you with water; but One
migh er than I is coming, whose sandal
strap I am not worthy to loose. He will
bap ze you with the Holy Spirit and ﬁre.LUKE 3
24
17 "His winnowing fan is in His hand,
and He will thoroughly clean out His
threshing ﬂoor, and gather the wheat
into His barn; but the chaﬀ He will burn
with unquenchable ﬁre."
18 And with many other exhorta ons he
preached to the people.
19 But Herod the tetrarch, being
rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his
brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils
which Herod had done,
20 also added this, above all, that he
shut John up in prison.
21 When all the people were bap zed,
it came to pass that Jesus also was
bap zed; and while He prayed, the
heaven was opened.
22 And the Holy Spirit descended in
bodily form like a dove upon Him, and
a voice came from heaven which said,
"You are My beloved Son; in You I am
well pleased."LUKE 3
25
23 Now Jesus Himself began His ministry
at about thirty years of age, being (as
was supposed) the son of Joseph, the
son of Heli,
24 the son of Ma hat, the son of Levi,
the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the
son of Joseph,

1 Then Jesus, being ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit, returned from the
Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness,
2 being tempted for forty days by the
devil. And in those days He ate nothing,
and a erward, when they had ended,
He was hungry.
3 And the devil said to Him, "If You are
the Son of God, command this stone to
become bread."
4 But Jesus answered him, saying, "It
is wri en, ‘Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word of God.’"
5 Then the devil, taking Him up on
a high mountain, showed Him all the
4LUKE 4
28
kingdoms of the world in a moment of
me.
6 And the devil said to Him, "All this
authority I will give You, and their glory;
for this has been delivered to me, and I
give it to whomever I wish.
7 "Therefore, if You will worship before
me, all will be Yours."
8 And Jesus answered and said to him,
"Get behind Me, Satan! For it is wri en,
‘You shall worship the LORD your God,
and Him only you shall serve.’"
9 Then he brought Him to Jerusalem,
set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to Him, "If You are the Son of
God, throw Yourself down from here.
10 "For it is wri en: ‘He shall give His
angels charge over you, To keep you,’
11 "and, ‘In their hands they shall bear
you up, Lest you dash your foot against a
stone.’"LUKE 4
29
12 And Jesus answered and said to him,
"It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt
the LORD your God.’"
13 Now when the devil had ended every
tempta on, he departed from Him un l
an opportune me.
14 Then Jesus returned in the power of
the Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him
went out through all the surrounding
region.
15 And He taught in their synagogues,
being gloriﬁed by all.
16 So He came to Nazareth, where He
had been brought up. And as His custom
was, He went into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day, and stood up to read.
17 And He was handed the book of
the prophet Isaiah. And when He had
opened the book, He found the place
where it was wri en:
18 "The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me,
Because He has anointed Me To preachLUKE 4
30
the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me
to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim
liberty to the cap ves And recovery of
sight to the blind, To set at liberty those
who are oppressed;
19 To proclaim the acceptable year of
the LORD."
20 Then He closed the book, and gave
it back to the a endant and sat down.
And the eyes of all who were in the
synagogue were ﬁxed on Him.
21 And He began to say to them, "Today
this Scripture is fulﬁlled in your hearing."
22 So all bore witness to Him, and
marveled at the gracious words which
proceeded out of His mouth. And they
said, "Is this not Joseph’s son?"
23 He said to them, "You will surely
say this proverb to Me, ‘Physician, heal
yourself! Whatever we have heard done
in Capernaum, do also here in Your
country.’"LUKE 4
31
24 Then He said, "Assuredly, I say to
you, no prophet is accepted in his own
country.
25 "But I tell you truly, many widows
were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when
the heaven was shut up three years and
six months, and there was a great famine
throughout all the land;
26 "but to none of them was Elijah sent
except to Zarephath, in the region of
Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
27 "And many lepers were in Israel in
the me of Elisha the prophet, and none
of them was cleansed except Naaman
the Syrian."
28 So all those in the synagogue, when
they heard these things, were ﬁlled with
wrath,
29 and rose up and thrust Him out of
the city; and they led Him to the brow
of the hill on which their city was built,LUKE 4
32
that they might throw Him down over
the cliﬀ.
30 Then passing through the midst of
them, He went His way.
31 Then He went down to Capernaum,
a city of Galilee, and was teaching them
on the Sabbaths.
32 And they were astonished at
His teaching, for His word was with
authority.
33 Now in the synagogue there was
a man who had a spirit of an unclean
demon. And he cried out with a loud
voice,
34 saying, "Let us alone! What have we
to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did
You come to destroy us? I know who You
are––the Holy One of God!"
35 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be
quiet, and come out of him!" And when
the demon had thrown him in theirLUKE 4
33
midst, it came out of him and did not
hurt him.
36 Then they were all amazed and
spoke among themselves, saying, "What
a word this is! For with authority and
power He commands the unclean spirits,
and they come out."
37 And the report about Him went out
into every place in the surrounding
region.
38 Now He arose from the synagogue
and entered Simon’s house. But Simon’s
wife’s mother was sick with a high
fever, and they made request of Him
concerning her.
39 So He stood over her and rebuked the
fever, and it le her. And immediately
she arose and served them.
40 When the sun was se ng, all those
who had any that were sick with various
diseases brought them to Him; and HeLUKE 4 – 5
34
laid His hands on every one of them and
healed them.
41 And demons also came out of
many, crying out and saying, "You are
the Christ, the Son of God!" And He,
rebuking them, did not allow them to
speak, for they knew that He was the
Christ.
42 Now when it was day, He departed
and went into a deserted place. And the
crowd sought Him and came to Him, and
tried to keep Him from leaving them;
43 but He said to them, "I must preach
the kingdom of God to the other ci es
also, because for this purpose I have
been sent."
44 And He was preaching in the
synagogues of Galilee.
1 So it was, as the mul tude pressed
about Him to hear the word of God,
that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,
5LUKE 5
35
2 and saw two boats standing by the
lake; but the ﬁshermen had gone from
them and were washing their nets.
3 Then He got into one of the boats,
which was Simon’s, and asked him to
put out a li le from the land. And He sat
down and taught the mul tudes from
the boat.
4 When He had stopped speaking, He
said to Simon, "Launch out into the deep
and let down your nets for a catch."
5 But Simon answered and said to Him,
"Master, we have toiled all night and
caught nothing; nevertheless at Your
word I will let down the net."
6 And when they had done this, they
caught a great number of ﬁsh, and their
net was breaking.
7 So they signaled to their partners in
the other boat to come and help them.
And they came and ﬁlled both the boats,
so that they began to sink.LUKE 5
36
8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down
at Jesus’ knees, saying, "Depart from
me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"
9 For he and all who were with him
were astonished at the catch of ﬁsh
which they had taken;
10 and so also were James and John,
the sons of Zebedee, who were partners
with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon,
"Do not be afraid. From now on you will
catch men."
11 So when they had brought their
boats to land, they forsook all and
followed Him.
12 And it happened when He was in
a certain city, that behold, a man who
was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell
on his face and implored Him, saying,
"Lord, if You are willing, You can make
me clean."
13 Then He put out His hand and
touched him, saying, "I am willing; beLUKE 5
37
cleansed." Immediately the leprosy le
him.
14 And He charged him to tell no one,
"But go and show yourself to the priest,
and make an oﬀering for your cleansing,
as a tes mony to them, just as Moses
commanded."
15 However, the report went around
concerning Him all the more; and great
mul tudes came together to hear, and
to be healed by Him of their inﬁrmi es.
16 So He Himself o en withdrew into
the wilderness and prayed.
17 Now it happened on a certain day,
as He was teaching, that there were
Pharisees and teachers of the law si ng
by, who had come out of every town of
Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the
power of the Lord was present to heal
them.LUKE 5
38
18 Then behold, men brought on a bed
a man who was paralyzed, whom they
sought to bring in and lay before Him.
19 And when they could not ﬁnd how
they might bring him in, because of the
crowd, they went up on the housetop
and let him down with his bed through
the ling into the midst before Jesus.
20 When He saw their faith, He said to
him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
21 And the scribes and the Pharisees
began to reason, saying, "Who is this
who speaks blasphemies? Who can
forgive sins but God alone?"
22 But when Jesus perceived their
thoughts, He answered and said to
them, "Why are you reasoning in your
hearts?
23 "Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins
are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and
walk’?LUKE 5
39
24 "But that you may know that the Son
of Man has power on earth to forgive
sins" ––He said to the man who was
paralyzed, "I say to you, arise, take up
your bed, and go to your house."
25 Immediately he rose up before them,
took up what he had been lying on, and
departed to his own house, glorifying
God.
26 And they were all amazed, and they
gloriﬁed God and were ﬁlled with fear,
saying, "We have seen strange things
today!"
27 A er these things He went out and
saw a tax collector named Levi, si ng
at the tax oﬃce. And He said to him,
"Follow Me."
28 So he le all, rose up, and followed
Him.
29 Then Levi gave Him a great feast in
his own house. And there were a greatLUKE 5
40
number of tax collectors and others who
sat down with them.
30 And their scribes and the Pharisees
complained against His disciples, saying,
"Why do You eat and drink with tax
collectors and sinners?"
31 Jesus answered and said to them,
"Those who are well have no need of a
physician, but those who are sick.
32 "I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners, to repentance."
33 Then they said to Him, "Why do
the disciples of John fast o en and
make prayers, and likewise those of the
Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?"
34 And He said to them, "Can you make
the friends of the bridegroom fast while
the bridegroom is with them?
35 "But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from
them; then they will fast in those days."LUKE 5 – 6
41
36 Then He spoke a parable to them:
"No one puts a piece from a new
garment on an old one; otherwise the
new makes a tear, and also the piece
that was taken out of the new does not
match the old.
37 "And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins; or else the new wine will
burst the wineskins and be spilled, and
the wineskins will be ruined.
38 "But new wine must be put into new
wineskins, and both are preserved.
39 "And no one, having drunk old wine,
immediately desires new; for he says,
‘The old is be er.’"
1 Now it happened on the second
Sabbath a er the ﬁrst that He went
through the grainﬁelds. And His disciples
plucked the heads of grain and ate them,
rubbing them in their hands.
6LUKE 6
42
2 And some of the Pharisees said to
them, "Why are you doing what is not
lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
3 But Jesus answering them said, "Have
you not even read this, what David did
when he was hungry, he and those who
were with him:
4 "how he went into the house of God,
took and ate the showbread, and also
gave some to those with him, which
is not lawful for any but the priests to
eat?"
5 And He said to them, "The Son of Man
is also Lord of the Sabbath."
6 Now it happened on another Sabbath,
also, that He entered the synagogue and
taught. And a man was there whose
right hand was withered.
7 So the scribes and Pharisees watched
Him closely, whether He would heal on
the Sabbath, that they might ﬁnd an
accusa on against Him.LUKE 6
43
8 But He knew their thoughts, and said
to the man who had the withered hand,
"Arise and stand here." And he arose
and stood.
9 Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask
you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath
to do good or to do evil, to save life or to
destroy?"
10 And when He had looked around at
them all, He said to the man, "Stretch
out your hand." And he did so, and his
hand was restored as whole as the other.
11 But they were ﬁlled with rage, and
discussed with one another what they
might do to Jesus.
12 Now it came to pass in those days
that He went out to the mountain to
pray, and con nued all night in prayer to
God.
13 And when it was day, He called His
disciples to Himself; and from themLUKE 6
44
He chose twelve whom He also named
apostles:
14 Simon, whom He also named Peter,
and Andrew his brother; James and
John; Philip and Bartholomew;
15 Ma hew and Thomas; James the
son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the
Zealot;
16 Judas the son of James, and Judas
Iscariot who also became a traitor.
17 And He came down with them and
stood on a level place with a crowd of
His disciples and a great mul tude of
people from all Judea and Jerusalem,
and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon,
who came to hear Him and be healed of
their diseases,
18 as well as those who were tormented
with unclean spirits. And they were
healed.LUKE 6
19 And the whole mul
45
tude sought to
touch Him, for power went out from Him
and healed them all.
20 Then He li ed up His eyes toward
His disciples, and said: "Blessed are you
poor, For yours is the kingdom of God.
21 Blessed are you who hunger now, For
you shall be ﬁlled. Blessed are you who
weep now, For you shall laugh.
22 Blessed are you when men hate you,
And when they exclude you, And revile
you, and cast out your name as evil, For
the Son of Man’s sake.
23 Rejoice in that day and leap for
joy! For indeed your reward is great in
heaven, For in like manner their fathers
did to the prophets.
24 "But woe to you who are rich, For
you have received your consola on.
25 Woe to you who are full, For you shall
hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, For
you shall mourn and weep.LUKE 6
46
26 Woe to you when all men speak well
of you, For so did their fathers to the
false prophets.
27 "But I say to you who hear: Love your
enemies, do good to those who hate
you,
28 "bless those who curse you, and pray
for those who spitefully use you.
29 "To him who strikes you on the one
cheek, oﬀer the other also. And from
him who takes away your cloak, do not
withhold your tunic either.
30 "Give to everyone who asks of you.
And from him who takes away your
goods do not ask them back.
31 "And just as you want men to do to
you, you also do to them likewise.
32 "But if you love those who love you,
what credit is that to you? For even
sinners love those who love them.LUKE 6
47
33 "And if you do good to those who do
good to you, what credit is that to you?
For even sinners do the same.
34 "And if you lend to those from whom
you hope to receive back, what credit
is that to you? For even sinners lend to
sinners to receive as much back.
35 "But love your enemies, do good,
and lend, hoping for nothing in return;
and your reward will be great, and you
will be sons of the Most High. For He is
kind to the unthankful and evil.
36 "Therefore be merciful, just as your
Father also is merciful.
37 "Judge not, and you shall not be
judged. Condemn not, and you shall not
be condemned. Forgive, and you will be
forgiven.
38 "Give, and it will be given to you:
good measure, pressed down, shaken
together, and running over will be
put into your bosom. For with theLUKE 6
48
same measure that you use, it will be
measured back to you."
39 And He spoke a parable to them:
"Can the blind lead the blind? Will they
not both fall into the ditch?
40 "A disciple is not above his teacher,
but everyone who is perfectly trained
will be like his teacher.
41 "And why do you look at the speck in
your brother’s eye, but do not perceive
the plank in your own eye?
42 "Or how can you say to your brother,
‘Brother, let me remove the speck that
is in your eye,’ when you yourself do
not see the plank that is in your own
eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank
from your own eye, and then you will
see clearly to remove the speck that is in
your brother’s eye.
43 "For a good tree does not bear bad
fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.LUKE 6
49
44 "For every tree is known by its own
fruit. For men do not gather ﬁgs from
thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a
bramble bush.
45 "A good man out of the good
treasure of his heart brings forth good;
and an evil man out of the evil treasure
of his heart brings forth evil. For out of
the abundance of the heart his mouth
speaks.
46 "But why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’
and do not do the things which I say?
47 "Whoever comes to Me, and hears
My sayings and does them, I will show
you whom he is like:
48 "He is like a man building a house,
who dug deep and laid the founda on
on the rock. And when the ﬂood arose,
the stream beat vehemently against that
house, and could not shake it, for it was
founded on the rock.LUKE 6 – 7
50
49 "But he who heard and did nothing
is like a man who built a house on the
earth without a founda on, against
which the stream beat vehemently; and
immediately it fell. And the ruin of that
house was great."
1 Now when He concluded all His
sayings in the hearing of the people,
He entered Capernaum.
2 And a certain centurion’s servant, who
was dear to him, was sick and ready to
die.
3 So when he heard about Jesus, he
sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading
with Him to come and heal his servant.
4 And when they came to Jesus, they
begged Him earnestly, saying that the
one for whom He should do this was
deserving,
5 "for he loves our na on, and has built
us a synagogue."
7LUKE 7
51
6 Then Jesus went with them. And when
He was already not far from the house,
the centurion sent friends to Him, saying
to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself,
for I am not worthy that You should
enter under my roof.
7 "Therefore I did not even think myself
worthy to come to You. But say the
word, and my servant will be healed.
8 "For I also am a man placed under
authority, having soldiers under me. And
I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to
another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to
my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it."
9 When Jesus heard these things, He
marveled at him, and turned around and
said to the crowd that followed Him, "I
say to you, I have not found such great
faith, not even in Israel!"
10 And those who were sent, returning
to the house, found the servant well
who had been sick.LUKE 7
11 Now it happened, the day a
52
er, that
He went into a city called Nain; and
many of His disciples went with Him, and
a large crowd.
12 And when He came near the gate of
the city, behold, a dead man was being
carried out, the only son of his mother;
and she was a widow. And a large crowd
from the city was with her.
13 When the Lord saw her, He had
compassion on her and said to her, "Do
not weep."
14 Then He came and touched the open
coﬃn, and those who carried him stood
s ll. And He said, "Young man, I say to
you, arise."
15 So he who was dead sat up and
began to speak. And He presented him
to his mother.
16 Then fear came upon all, and they
gloriﬁed God, saying, "A great prophetLUKE 7
53
has risen up among us"; and, "God has
visited His people."
17 And this report about Him went
throughout all Judea and all the
surrounding region.
18 Then the disciples of John reported
to him concerning all these things.
19 And John, calling two of his disciples
to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are
You the Coming One, or do we look for
another?"
20 When the men had come to Him,
they said, "John the Bap st has sent us
to You, saying, ‘Are You the Coming One,
or do we look for another?’"
21 And that very hour He cured many
of inﬁrmi es, aﬄic ons, and evil spirits;
and to many blind He gave sight.
22 Jesus answered and said to them,
"Go and tell John the things you have
seen and heard: that the blind see, the
lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, theLUKE 7
54
deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor
have the gospel preached to them.
23 "And blessed is he who is not
oﬀended because of Me."
24 When the messengers of John had
departed, He began to speak to the
mul tudes concerning John: "What did
you go out into the wilderness to see? A
reed shaken by the wind?
25 "But what did you go out to see? A
man clothed in so garments? Indeed
those who are gorgeously appareled and
live in luxury are in kings’ courts.
26 "But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more
than a prophet.
27 "This is he of whom it is wri en:
‘Behold, I send My messenger before
Your face, Who will prepare Your way
before You.’
28 "For I say to you, among those born
of women there is not a greater prophetLUKE 7
55
than John the Bap st; but he who is
least in the kingdom of God is greater
than he."
29 And when all the people heard Him,
even the tax collectors jus ﬁed God,
having been bap zed with the bap sm
of John.
30 But the Pharisees and lawyers
rejected the will of God for themselves,
not having been bap zed by him.
31 And the Lord said, "To what then
shall I liken the men of this genera on,
and what are they like?
32 "They are like children si ng in the
marketplace and calling to one another,
saying: ‘We played the ﬂute for you, And
you did not dance; We mourned to you,
And you did not weep.’
33 "For John the Bap st came neither
ea ng bread nor drinking wine, and you
say, ‘He has a demon.’LUKE 7
34 "The Son of Man has come ea
56
ng
and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a
glu on and a winebibber, a friend of tax
collectors and sinners!’
35 "But wisdom is jus ﬁed by all her
children."
36 Then one of the Pharisees asked Him
to eat with him. And He went to the
Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat.
37 And behold, a woman in the city who
was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus
sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house,
brought an alabaster ﬂask of fragrant oil,
38 and stood at His feet behind Him
weeping; and she began to wash His feet
with her tears, and wiped them with the
hair of her head; and she kissed His feet
and anointed them with the fragrant oil.
39 Now when the Pharisee who had
invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself,
saying, "This man, if He were a prophet,
would know who and what manner ofLUKE 7
57
woman this is who is touching Him, for
she is a sinner."
40 And Jesus answered and said to him,
"Simon, I have something to say to you."
So he said, "Teacher, say it."
41 "There was a certain creditor who
had two debtors. One owed ﬁve hundred
denarii, and the other ﬁ y.
42 "And when they had nothing with
which to repay, he freely forgave them
both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them
will love him more?"
43 Simon answered and said, "I suppose
the one whom he forgave more." And He
said to him, "You have rightly judged."
44 Then He turned to the woman and
said to Simon, "Do you see this woman?
I entered your house; you gave Me no
water for My feet, but she has washed
My feet with her tears and wiped them
with the hair of her head.LUKE 7 – 8
58
45 "You gave Me no kiss, but this woman
has not ceased to kiss My feet since the
me I came in.
46 "You did not anoint My head with oil,
but this woman has anointed My feet
with fragrant oil.
47 "Therefore I say to you, her sins,
which are many, are forgiven, for she
loved much. But to whom li le is
forgiven, the same loves li le."
48 Then He said to her, "Your sins are
forgiven."
49 And those who sat at the table with
Him began to say to themselves, "Who is
this who even forgives sins?"
50 Then He said to the woman, "Your
faith has saved you. Go in peace."
1 Now it came to pass, a erward,
that He went through every city and
village, preaching and bringing the glad
dings of the kingdom of God. And the
twelve were with Him,
8LUKE 8
59
2 and certain women who had been
healed of evil spirits and inﬁrmi es––
Mary called Magdalene, out of whom
had come seven demons,
3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s
steward, and Susanna, and many
others who provided for Him from their
substance.
4 And when a great mul tude had
gathered, and they had come to Him
from every city, He spoke by a parable:
5 "A sower went out to sow his seed.
And as he sowed, some fell by the
wayside; and it was trampled down, and
the birds of the air devoured it.
6 "Some fell on rock; and as soon as it
sprang up, it withered away because it
lacked moisture.
7 "And some fell among thorns, and the
thorns sprang up with it and choked it.

sprang up, and yielded a crop aLUKE 8

hundredfold." When He had said these
things He cried, "He who has ears to
hear, let him hear!"
9 Then His disciples asked Him, saying,
"What does this parable mean?"
10 And He said, "To you it has been given
to know the mysteries of the kingdom
of God, but to the rest it is given in
parables, that ‘Seeing they may not see,
And hearing they may not understand.’
11 "Now the parable is this: The seed is
the word of God.
12 "Those by the wayside are the ones
who hear; then the devil comes and
takes away the word out of their hearts,
lest they should believe and be saved.
13 "But the ones on the rock are those
who, when they hear, receive the
word with joy; and these have no root,
who believe for a while and in me of
tempta on fall away.LUKE 8
61
14 "Now the ones that fell among thorns
are those who, when they have heard,
go out and are choked with cares, riches,
and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit
to maturity.
15 "But the ones that fell on the good
ground are those who, having heard the
word with a noble and good heart, keep
it and bear fruit with pa ence.
16 "No one, when he has lit a lamp,
covers it with a vessel or puts it under
a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, that
those who enter may see the light.
17 "For nothing is secret that will not be
revealed, nor anything hidden that will
not be known and come to light.
18 "Therefore take heed how you hear.
For whoever has, to him more will be
given; and whoever does not have, even
what he seems to have will be taken
from him."LUKE 8
62
19 Then His mother and brothers came
to Him, and could not approach Him
because of the crowd.
20 And it was told Him by some, who
said, "Your mother and Your brothers are
standing outside, desiring to see You."
21 But He answered and said to them,
"My mother and My brothers are these
who hear the word of God and do it."
22 Now it happened, on a certain day,
that He got into a boat with His disciples.
And He said to them, "Let us cross over
to the other side of the lake." And they
launched out.
23 But as they sailed He fell asleep. And
a windstorm came down on the lake,
and they were ﬁlling with water, and
were in jeopardy.
24 And they came to Him and awoke
Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are
perishing!" Then He arose and rebukedLUKE 8
63
the wind and the raging of the water.
And they ceased, and there was a calm.
25 But He said to them, "Where is
your faith?" And they were afraid, and
marveled, saying to one another, "Who
can this be? For He commands even the
winds and water, and they obey Him!"
26 Then they sailed to the country of the
Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
27 And when He stepped out on the
land, there met Him a certain man from
the city who had demons for a long me.
And he wore no clothes, nor did he live
in a house but in the tombs.
28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell
down before Him, and with a loud voice
said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus,
Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do
not torment me!"
29 For He had commanded the unclean
spirit to come out of the man. For it had
o en seized him, and he was kept underLUKE 8
64
guard, bound with chains and shackles;
and he broke the bonds and was driven
by the demon into the wilderness.
30 Jesus asked him, saying, "What is
your name?" And he said, "Legion,"
because many demons had entered him.
31 And they begged Him that He would
not command them to go out into the
abyss.
32 Now a herd of many swine was
feeding there on the mountain. So they
begged Him that He would permit them
to enter them. And He permi ed them.
33 Then the demons went out of the
man and entered the swine, and the
herd ran violently down the steep place
into the lake and drowned.
34 When those who fed them saw what
had happened, they ﬂed and told it in
the city and in the country.
35 Then they went out to see what had
happened, and came to Jesus, and foundLUKE 8
65
the man from whom the demons had
departed, si ng at the feet of Jesus,
clothed and in his right mind. And they
were afraid.
36 They also who had seen it told
them by what means he who had been
demon–possessed was healed.
37 Then the whole mul tude of the
surrounding region of the Gadarenes
asked Him to depart from them, for they
were seized with great fear. And He got
into the boat and returned.
38 Now the man from whom the
demons had departed begged Him that
he might be with Him. But Jesus sent
him away, saying,
39 "Return to your own house, and tell
what great things God has done for you."
And he went his way and proclaimed
throughout the whole city what great
things Jesus had done for him.LUKE 8
66
40 So it was, when Jesus returned, that
the mul tude welcomed Him, for they
were all wai ng for Him.
41 And behold, there came a man
named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the
synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus’
feet and begged Him to come to his
house,
42 for he had an only daughter about
twelve years of age, and she was dying.
But as He went, the mul tudes thronged
Him.
43 Now a woman, having a ﬂow of blood
for twelve years, who had spent all her
livelihood on physicians and could not
be healed by any,
44 came from behind and touched the
border of His garment. And immediately
her ﬂow of blood stopped.
45 And Jesus said, "Who touched Me?"
When all denied it, Peter and those
with him said, "Master, the mul tudesLUKE 8
67
throng and press You, and You say, ‘Who
touched Me?’"
46 But Jesus said, "Somebody touched
Me, for I perceived power going out
from Me."
47 Now when the woman saw that she
was not hidden, she came trembling; and
falling down before Him, she declared to
Him in the presence of all the people the
reason she had touched Him and how
she was healed immediately.
48 And He said to her, "Daughter, be of
good cheer; your faith has made you
well. Go in peace."
49 While He was s ll speaking, someone
came from the ruler of the synagogue’s
house, saying to him, "Your daughter is
dead. Do not trouble the Teacher."
50 But when Jesus heard it, He answered
him, saying, "Do not be afraid; only
believe, and she will be made well."LUKE 8 – 9
68
51 When He came into the house, He
permi ed no one to go in except Peter,
James, and John, and the father and
mother of the girl.
52 Now all wept and mourned for her;
but He said, "Do not weep; she is not
dead, but sleeping."
53 And they ridiculed Him, knowing that
she was dead.
54 But He put them all outside, took her
by the hand and called, saying, "Li le
girl, arise."
55 Then her spirit returned, and she
arose immediately. And He commanded
that she be given something to eat.
56 And her parents were astonished,
but He charged them to tell no one what
had happened.
1 Then He called His twelve disciples
together and gave them power and
authority over all demons, and to cure
diseases.
9LUKE 9
69
2 He sent them to preach the kingdom
of God and to heal the sick.
3 And He said to them, "Take nothing
for the journey, neither staﬀs nor bag
nor bread nor money; and do not have
two tunics apiece.
4 "Whatever house you enter, stay
there, and from there depart.
5 "And whoever will not receive you,
when you go out of that city, shake
oﬀ the very dust from your feet as a
tes mony against them."
6 So they departed and went through
the towns, preaching the gospel and
healing everywhere.
7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of
all that was done by Him; and he was
perplexed, because it was said by some
that John had risen from the dead,
8 and by some that Elijah had appeared,
and by others that one of the old
prophets had risen again.LUKE 9
70
9 Herod said, "John I have beheaded,
but who is this of whom I hear such
things?" So he sought to see Him.
10 And the apostles, when they had
returned, told Him all that they had
done. Then He took them and went
aside privately into a deserted place
belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
11 But when the mul tudes knew it,
they followed Him; and He received
them and spoke to them about the
kingdom of God, and healed those who
had need of healing.
12 When the day began to wear away,
the twelve came and said to Him, "Send
the mul tude away, that they may go
into the surrounding towns and country,
and lodge and get provisions; for we are
in a deserted place here."
13 But He said to them, "You give them
something to eat." And they said, "We
have no more than ﬁve loaves and twoLUKE 9
71
ﬁsh, unless we go and buy food for all
these people."
14 For there were about ﬁve thousand
men. Then He said to His disciples,
"Make them sit down in groups of ﬁ y."
15 And they did so, and made them all
sit down.
16 Then He took the ﬁve loaves and
the two ﬁsh, and looking up to heaven,
He blessed and broke them, and gave
them to the disciples to set before the
mul tude.
17 So they all ate and were ﬁlled, and
twelve baskets of the le over fragments
were taken up by them.
18 And it happened, as He was alone
praying, that His disciples joined Him,
and He asked them, saying, "Who do the
crowds say that I am?"
19 So they answered and said, "John the
Bap st, but some say Elijah; and othersLUKE 9
72
say that one of the old prophets has
risen again."
20 He said to them, "But who do you
say that I am?" Peter answered and said,
"The Christ of God."
21 And He strictly warned and
commanded them to tell this to no one,
22 saying, "The Son of Man must suﬀer
many things, and be rejected by the
elders and chief priests and scribes, and
be killed, and be raised the third day."
23 Then He said to them all, "If anyone
desires to come a er Me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross daily, and
follow Me.
24 "For whoever desires to save his life
will lose it, but whoever loses his life for
My sake will save it.
25 "For what proﬁt is it to a man if he
gains the whole world, and is himself
destroyed or lost?LUKE 9
73
26 "For whoever is ashamed of Me and
My words, of him the Son of Man will
be ashamed when He comes in His own
glory, and in His Father’s, and of the holy
angels.
27 "But I tell you truly, there are some
standing here who shall not taste death
ll they see the kingdom of God."
28 Now it came to pass, about eight
days a er these sayings, that He took
Peter, John, and James and went up on
the mountain to pray.
29 As He prayed, the appearance of His
face was altered, and His robe became
white and glistening.
30 And behold, two men talked with
Him, who were Moses and Elijah,
31 who appeared in glory and spoke
of His decease which He was about to
accomplish at Jerusalem.
32 But Peter and those with him were
heavy with sleep; and when they wereLUKE 9
74
fully awake, they saw His glory and the
two men who stood with Him.
33 Then it happened, as they were
par ng from Him, that Peter said to
Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be
here; and let us make three tabernacles:
one for You, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah" ––not knowing what he said.
34 While he was saying this, a cloud
came and overshadowed them; and they
were fearful as they entered the cloud.
35 And a voice came out of the cloud,
saying, "This is My beloved Son. Hear
Him!"
36 When the voice had ceased, Jesus
was found alone. But they kept quiet,
and told no one in those days any of the
things they had seen.
37 Now it happened on the next day,
when they had come down from the
mountain, that a great mul tude met
Him.LUKE 9
38 Suddenly a man from the mul
75
tude
cried out, saying, "Teacher, I implore You,
look on my son, for he is my only child.
39 "And behold, a spirit seizes him, and
he suddenly cries out; it convulses him
so that he foams at the mouth, and it
departs from him with great diﬃculty,
bruising him.
40 "So I implored Your disciples to cast
it out, but they could not."
41 Then Jesus answered and said, "O
faithless and perverse genera on, how
long shall I be with you and bear with
you? Bring your son here."
42 And as he was s ll coming, the
demon threw him down and convulsed
him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean
spirit, healed the child, and gave him
back to his father.
43 And they were all amazed at the
majesty of God. But while everyoneLUKE 9
76
marveled at all the things which Jesus
did, He said to His disciples,
44 "Let these words sink down into your
ears, for the Son of Man is about to be
betrayed into the hands of men."
45 But they did not understand this
saying, and it was hidden from them so
that they did not perceive it; and they
were afraid to ask Him about this saying.
46 Then a dispute arose among them as
to which of them would be greatest.
47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of
their heart, took a li le child and set him
by Him,
48 and said to them, "Whoever receives
this li le child in My name receives Me;
and whoever receives Me receives Him
who sent Me. For he who is least among
you all will be great."
49 Now John answered and said,
"Master, we saw someone cas ng out
demons in Your name, and we forbadeLUKE 9
77
him because he does not follow with
us."
50 But Jesus said to him, "Do not forbid
him, for he who is not against us is on
our side."
51 Now it came to pass, when the me
had come for Him to be received up,
that He steadfastly set His face to go to
Jerusalem,
52 and sent messengers before His face.
And as they went, they entered a village
of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.
53 But they did not receive Him,
because His face was set for the journey
to Jerusalem.
54 And when His disciples James and
John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You
want us to command ﬁre to come down
from heaven and consume them, just as
Elijah did?"LUKE 9
78
55 But He turned and rebuked them,
and said, "You do not know what manner
of spirit you are of.
56 "For the Son of Man did not come to
destroy men’s lives but to save them."
And they went to another village.
57 Now it happened as they journeyed
on the road, that someone said to Him,
"Lord, I will follow You wherever You go."
58 And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have
holes and birds of the air have nests, but
the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His
head."
59 Then He said to another, "Follow
Me." But he said, "Lord, let me ﬁrst go
and bury my father."
60 Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury
their own dead, but you go and preach
the kingdom of God."
61 And another also said, "Lord, I will
follow You, but let me ﬁrst go and bid
them farewell who are at my house."LUKE 9 – 10
79
62 But Jesus said to him, "No one,
having put his hand to the plow, and
looking back, is ﬁt for the kingdom of
God."
1 A er these things the Lord
appointed seventy others also,
and sent them two by two before His
face into every city and place where He
Himself was about to go.
2 Then He said to them, "The harvest
truly is great, but the laborers are few;
therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to
send out laborers into His harvest.
3 "Go your way; behold, I send you out
as lambs among wolves.
4 "Carry neither money bag, knapsack,
nor sandals; and greet no one along the
road.
5 "But whatever house you enter, ﬁrst
say, ‘Peace to this house.’
10LUKE 10
80
6 "And if a son of peace is there, your
peace will rest on it; if not, it will return
to you.
7 "And remain in the same house,
ea ng and drinking such things as they
give, for the laborer is worthy of his
wages. Do not go from house to house.
8 "Whatever city you enter, and they
receive you, eat such things as are set
before you.
9 "And heal the sick there, and say to
them, ‘The kingdom of God has come
near to you.’
10 "But whatever city you enter, and
they do not receive you, go out into its
streets and say,
11 ‘The very dust of your city which
clings to us we wipe oﬀ against you.
Nevertheless know this, that the
kingdom of God has come near you.’LUKE 10
81
12 "But I say to you that it will be more
tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for
that city.
13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which
were done in you had been done in Tyre
and Sidon, they would have repented
long ago, si ng in sackcloth and ashes.
14 "But it will be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
15 "And you, Capernaum, who are
exalted to heaven, will be brought down
to Hades.
16 "He who hears you hears Me, he
who rejects you rejects Me, and he who
rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me."
17 Then the seventy returned with joy,
saying, "Lord, even the demons are
subject to us in Your name."
18 And He said to them, "I saw Satan fall
like lightning from heaven.LUKE 10
82
19 "Behold, I give you the authority to
trample on serpents and scorpions, and
over all the power of the enemy, and
nothing shall by any means hurt you.
20 "Nevertheless do not rejoice in this,
that the spirits are subject to you, but
rather rejoice because your names are
wri en in heaven."
21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the
Spirit and said, "I thank You, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, that You have
hidden these things from the wise and
prudent and revealed them to babes.
Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in
Your sight.
22 "All things have been delivered to Me
by My Father, and no one knows who
the Son is except the Father, and who
the Father is except the Son, and the one
to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."LUKE 10
83
23 Then He turned to His disciples and
said privately, "Blessed are the eyes
which see the things you see;
24 "for I tell you that many prophets
and kings have desired to see what you
see, and have not seen it, and to hear
what you hear, and have not heard it."
25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood
up and tested Him, saying, "Teacher,
what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
26 He said to him, "What is wri en in
the law? What is your reading of it?"
27 So he answered and said, "‘You shall
love the LORD your God with all your
heart, with all your soul, with all your
strength, and with all your mind,’ and
‘your neighbor as yourself.’"
28 And He said to him, "You have
answered rightly; do this and you will
live."
29 But he, wan ng to jus fy himself,
said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"LUKE 10
84
30 Then Jesus answered and said: "A
certain man went down from Jerusalem
to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who
stripped him of his clothing, wounded
him, and departed, leaving him half
dead.
31 "Now by chance a certain priest
came down that road. And when he saw
him, he passed by on the other side.
32 "Likewise a Levite, when he arrived at
the place, came and looked, and passed
by on the other side.
33 "But a certain Samaritan, as he
journeyed, came where he was. And
when he saw him, he had compassion.
34 "So he went to him and bandaged his
wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he
set him on his own animal, brought him
to an inn, and took care of him.
35 "On the next day, when he departed,
he took out two denarii, gave them to
the innkeeper, and said to him, ‘TakeLUKE 10
85
care of him; and whatever more you
spend, when I come again, I will repay
you.’
36 "So which of these three do you think
was neighbor to him who fell among the
thieves?"
37 And he said, "He who showed mercy
on him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and
do likewise."
38 Now it happened as they went
that He entered a certain village;
and a certain woman named Martha
welcomed Him into her house.
39 And she had a sister called Mary,
who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His
word.
40 But Martha was distracted with
much serving, and she approached Him
and said, "Lord, do You not care that
my sister has le me to serve alone?
Therefore tell her to help me."LUKE 10 – 11
86
41 And Jesus answered and said to her,
"Martha, Martha, you are worried and
troubled about many things.
42 "But one thing is needed, and Mary
has chosen that good part, which will
not be taken away from her."
1 Now it came to pass, as He was
praying in a certain place, when
He ceased, that one of His disciples said
to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John
also taught his disciples."
2 So He said to them, "When you pray,
say: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be
Your name. Your kingdom come. Your
will be done On earth as it is in heaven.
3 Give us day by day our daily bread.
4 And forgive us our sins, For we also
forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
And do not lead us into tempta on, But
deliver us from the evil one."
5 And He said to them, "Which of you
shall have a friend, and go to him at
11LUKE 11
87
midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend
me three loaves;
6 ‘for a friend of mine has come to me
on his journey, and I have nothing to set
before him’;
7 "and he will answer from within and
say, ‘Do not trouble me; the door is now
shut, and my children are with me in
bed; I cannot rise and give to you’?
8 "I say to you, though he will not rise
and give to him because he is his friend,
yet because of his persistence he will
rise and give him as many as he needs.
9 "So I say to you, ask, and it will be
given to you; seek, and you will ﬁnd;
knock, and it will be opened to you.
10 "For everyone who asks receives,
and he who seeks ﬁnds, and to him who
knocks it will be opened.
11 "If a son asks for bread from any
father among you, will he give him aLUKE 11
88
stone? Or if he asks for a ﬁsh, will he give
him a serpent instead of a ﬁsh?
12 "Or if he asks for an egg, will he oﬀer
him a scorpion?
13 "If you then, being evil, know how
to give good gi s to your children, how
much more will your heavenly Father
give the Holy Spirit to those who ask
Him!"
14 And He was cas ng out a demon, and
it was mute. So it was, when the demon
had gone out, that the mute spoke; and
the mul tudes marveled.
15 But some of them said, "He casts out
demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the
demons."
16 Others, tes ng Him, sought from Him
a sign from heaven.
17 But He, knowing their thoughts, said
to them: "Every kingdom divided against
itself is brought to desola on, and a
house divided against a house falls.LUKE 11
89
18 "If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand?
Because you say I cast out demons by
Beelzebub.
19 "And if I cast out demons by
Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast
them out? Therefore they will be your
judges.
20 "But if I cast out demons with the
ﬁnger of God, surely the kingdom of God
has come upon you.
21 "When a strong man, fully armed,
guards his own palace, his goods are in
peace.
22 "But when a stronger than he comes
upon him and overcomes him, he takes
from him all his armor in which he
trusted, and divides his spoils.
23 "He who is not with Me is against
Me, and he who does not gather with
Me sca ers.LUKE 11
90
24 "When an unclean spirit goes out
of a man, he goes through dry places,
seeking rest; and ﬁnding none, he says,
‘I will return to my house from which I
came.’
25 "And when he comes, he ﬁnds it
swept and put in order.
26 "Then he goes and takes with him
seven other spirits more wicked than
himself, and they enter and dwell there;
and the last state of that man is worse
than the ﬁrst."
27 And it happened, as He spoke these
things, that a certain woman from the
crowd raised her voice and said to Him,
"Blessed is the womb that bore You, and
the breasts which nursed You!"
28 But He said, "More than that, blessed
are those who hear the word of God and
keep it!"
29 And while the crowds were thickly
gathered together, He began to say, "ThisLUKE 11
91
is an evil genera on. It seeks a sign, and
no sign will be given to it except the sign
of Jonah the prophet.
30 "For as Jonah became a sign to the
Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be
to this genera on.
31 "The queen of the South will rise up
in the judgment with the men of this
genera on and condemn them, for she
came from the ends of the earth to hear
the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a
greater than Solomon is here.
32 "The men of Nineveh will rise up in
the judgment with this genera on and
condemn it, for they repented at the
preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater
than Jonah is here.
33 "No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts
it in a secret place or under a basket, but
on a lampstand, that those who come in
may see the light.LUKE 11
92
34 "The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore, when your eye is good, your
whole body also is full of light. But when
your eye is bad, your body also is full of
darkness.
35 "Therefore take heed that the light
which is in you is not darkness.
36 "If then your whole body is full of
light, having no part dark, the whole
body will be full of light, as when the
bright shining of a lamp gives you light."
37 And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee
asked Him to dine with him. So He went
in and sat down to eat.
38 When the Pharisee saw it, he
marveled that He had not ﬁrst washed
before dinner.
39 Then the Lord said to him, "Now you
Pharisees make the outside of the cup
and dish clean, but your inward part is
full of greed and wickedness.LUKE 11
93
40 "Foolish ones! Did not He who made
the outside make the inside also?
41 "But rather give alms of such things
as you have; then indeed all things are
clean to you.
42 "But woe to you Pharisees! For you
the mint and rue and all manner of
herbs, and pass by jus ce and the love
of God. These you ought to have done,
without leaving the others undone.
43 "Woe to you Pharisees! For you love
the best seats in the synagogues and
gree ngs in the marketplaces.
44 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you are like graves which
are not seen, and the men who walk
over them are not aware of them."
45 Then one of the lawyers answered
and said to Him, "Teacher, by saying
these things You reproach us also."
46 And He said, "Woe to you also,
lawyers! For you load men with burdensLUKE 11
94
hard to bear, and you yourselves do
not touch the burdens with one of your
ﬁngers.
47 "Woe to you! For you build the tombs
of the prophets, and your fathers killed
them.
48 "In fact, you bear witness that you
approve the deeds of your fathers; for
they indeed killed them, and you build
their tombs.
49 "Therefore the wisdom of God also
said, ‘I will send them prophets and
apostles, and some of them they will kill
and persecute,’
50 "that the blood of all the prophets
which was shed from the founda on
of the world may be required of this
genera on,
51 "from the blood of Abel to the blood
of Zechariah who perished between the
altar and the temple. Yes, I say to you, it
shall be required of this genera on.LUKE 11 – 12
95
52 "Woe to you lawyers! For you have
taken away the key of knowledge. You
did not enter in yourselves, and those
who were entering in you hindered."
53 And as He said these things to
them, the scribes and the Pharisees
began to assail Him vehemently, and to
cross–examine Him about many things,
54 lying in wait for Him, and seeking to
catch Him in something He might say,
that they might accuse Him.
1 In the mean me, when an
innumerable mul tude of people
had gathered together, so that they
trampled one another, He began to say
to His disciples ﬁrst of all, "Beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees, which is
hypocrisy.
2 "For there is nothing covered that will
not be revealed, nor hidden that will not
be known.
12LUKE 12
96
3 "Therefore whatever you have spoken
in the dark will be heard in the light,
and what you have spoken in the ear in
inner rooms will be proclaimed on the
housetops.
4 "And I say to you, My friends, do not
be afraid of those who kill the body, and
a er that have no more that they can
do.
5 "But I will show you whom you should
fear: Fear Him who, a er He has killed,
has power to cast into hell; yes, I say to
you, fear Him!
6 "Are not ﬁve sparrows sold for two
copper coins? And not one of them is
forgo en before God.
7 "But the very hairs of your head are
all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you
are of more value than many sparrows.
8 "Also I say to you, whoever confesses
Me before men, him the Son of Man also
will confess before the angels of God.LUKE 12
97
9 "But he who denies Me before men
will be denied before the angels of God.
10 "And anyone who speaks a word
against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven
him; but to him who blasphemes against
the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.
11 "Now when they bring you to
the synagogues and magistrates and
authori es, do not worry about how or
what you should answer, or what you
should say.
12 "For the Holy Spirit will teach you in
that very hour what you ought to say."
13 Then one from the crowd said to
Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide
the inheritance with me."
14 But He said to him, "Man, who made
Me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"
15 And He said to them, "Take heed and
beware of covetousness, for one’s life
does not consist in the abundance of the
things he possesses."LUKE 12
98
16 Then He spoke a parable to them,
saying: "The ground of a certain rich man
yielded plen fully.
17 "And he thought within himself,
saying, ‘What shall I do, since I have no
room to store my crops?’
18 "So he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull
down my barns and build greater, and
there I will store all my crops and my
goods.
19 ‘And I will say to my soul, "Soul,
you have many goods laid up for many
years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be
merry."’
20 "But God said to him, ‘Fool! This
night your soul will be required of you;
then whose will those things be which
you have provided?’
21 "So is he who lays up treasure for
himself, and is not rich toward God."
22 Then He said to His disciples,
"Therefore I say to you, do not worryLUKE 12
99
about your life, what you will eat; nor
about the body, what you will put on.
23 "Life is more than food, and the body
is more than clothing.
24 "Consider the ravens, for they
neither sow nor reap, which have
neither storehouse nor barn; and God
feeds them. Of how much more value
are you than the birds?
25 "And which of you by worrying can
add one cubit to his stature?
26 "If you then are not able to do the
least, why are you anxious for the rest?
27 "Consider the lilies, how they grow:
they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say
to you, even Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these.
28 "If then God so clothes the grass,
which today is in the ﬁeld and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven, how much more
will He clothe you, O you of li le faith?LUKE 12
100
29 "And do not seek what you should
eat or what you should drink, nor have
an anxious mind.
30 "For all these things the na ons of
the world seek a er, and your Father
knows that you need these things.
31 "But seek the kingdom of God, and
all these things shall be added to you.
32 "Do not fear, li le ﬂock, for it is your
Father’s good pleasure to give you the
kingdom.
33 "Sell what you have and give alms;
provide yourselves money bags which
do not grow old, a treasure in the
heavens that does not fail, where no
thief approaches nor moth destroys.
34 "For where your treasure is, there
your heart will be also.
35 "Let your waist be girded and your
lamps burning;
36 "and you yourselves be like men
who wait for their master, when he willLUKE 12
101
return from the wedding, that when he
comes and knocks they may open to him
immediately.
37 "Blessed are those servants whom
the master, when he comes, will ﬁnd
watching. Assuredly, I say to you that he
will gird himself and have them sit down
to eat, and will come and serve them.
38 "And if he should come in the second
watch, or come in the third watch, and
ﬁnd them so, blessed are those servants.
39 "But know this, that if the master
of the house had known what hour
the thief would come, he would have
watched and not allowed his house to
be broken into.
40 "Therefore you also be ready, for the
Son of Man is coming at an hour you do
not expect."
41 Then Peter said to Him, "Lord, do You
speak this parable only to us, or to all
people?"LUKE 12
102
42 And the Lord said, "Who then is
that faithful and wise steward, whom
his master will make ruler over his
household, to give them their por on of
food in due season?
43 "Blessed is that servant whom his
master will ﬁnd so doing when he comes.
44 "Truly, I say to you that he will make
him ruler over all that he has.
45 "But if that servant says in his heart,
‘My master is delaying his coming,’ and
begins to beat the male and female
servants, and to eat and drink and be
drunk,
46 "the master of that servant will come
on a day when he is not looking for him,
and at an hour when he is not aware,
and will cut him in two and appoint him
his por on with the unbelievers.
47 "And that servant who knew his
master’s will, and did not prepareLUKE 12
103
himself or do according to his will, shall
be beaten with many stripes.
48 "But he who did not know, yet
commi ed things deserving of stripes,
shall be beaten with few. For everyone
to whom much is given, from him much
will be required; and to whom much has
been commi ed, of him they will ask the
more.
49 "I came to send ﬁre on the earth, and
how I wish it were already kindled!
50 "But I have a bap sm to be bap zed
with, and how distressed I am ll it is
accomplished!
51 "Do you suppose that I came to give
peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but
rather division.
52 "For from now on ﬁve in one house
will be divided: three against two, and
two against three.
53 "Father will be divided against
son and son against father, motherLUKE 12
104
against daughter and daughter against
mother, mother–in–law against her
daughter–in–law and daughter–in–law
against her mother–in–law."
54 Then He also said to the mul tudes,
"Whenever you see a cloud rising out of
the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower
is coming’; and so it is.
55 "And when you see the south
wind blow, you say, ‘There will be hot
weather’; and there is.
56 "Hypocrites! You can discern the face
of the sky and of the earth, but how is it
you do not discern this me?
57 "Yes, and why, even of yourselves, do
you not judge what is right?
58 "When you go with your adversary to
the magistrate, make every eﬀort along
the way to se le with him, lest he drag
you to the judge, the judge deliver you
to the oﬃcer, and the oﬃcer throw you
into prison.LUKE 12 – 13
105
59 "I tell you, you shall not depart from
there ll you have paid the very last
mite."
1 There were present at that
season some who told Him about
the Galileans whose blood Pilate had
mingled with their sacriﬁces.
2 And Jesus answered and said to them,
"Do you suppose that these Galileans
were worse sinners than all other
Galileans, because they suﬀered such
things?
3 "I tell you, no; but unless you repent
you will all likewise perish.
4 "Or those eighteen on whom the
tower in Siloam fell and killed them,
do you think that they were worse
sinners than all other men who dwelt in
Jerusalem?
5 "I tell you, no; but unless you repent
you will all likewise perish."
13LUKE 13
106
6 He also spoke this parable: "A certain
man had a ﬁg tree planted in his
vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it
and found none.
7 "Then he said to the keeper of his
vineyard, ‘Look, for three years I have
come seeking fruit on this ﬁg tree and
ﬁnd none. Cut it down; why does it use
up the ground?’
8 "But he answered and said to him,
‘Sir, let it alone this year also, un l I dig
around it and fer lize it.
9 ‘And if it bears fruit, well. But if not,
a er that you can cut it down.’"
10 Now He was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the Sabbath.
11 And behold, there was a woman who
had a spirit of inﬁrmity eighteen years,
and was bent over and could in no way
raise herself up.LUKE 13
107
12 But when Jesus saw her, He called
her to Him and said to her, "Woman, you
are loosed from your inﬁrmity."
13 And He laid His hands on her, and
immediately she was made straight, and
gloriﬁed God.
14 But the ruler of the synagogue
answered with indigna on, because
Jesus had healed on the Sabbath; and
he said to the crowd, "There are six days
on which men ought to work; therefore
come and be healed on them, and not
on the Sabbath day."
15 The Lord then answered him and
said, "Hypocrite! Does not each one
of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or
donkey from the stall, and lead it away
to water it?
16 "So ought not this woman, being
a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan
has bound––think of it––for eighteenLUKE 13
108
years, be loosed from this bond on the
Sabbath?"
17 And when He said these things, all
His adversaries were put to shame; and
all the mul tude rejoiced for all the
glorious things that were done by Him.
18 Then He said, "What is the kingdom
of God like? And to what shall I compare
it?
19 "It is like a mustard seed, which a
man took and put in his garden; and it
grew and became a large tree, and the
birds of the air nested in its branches."
20 And again He said, "To what shall I
liken the kingdom of God?
21 "It is like leaven, which a woman took
and hid in three measures of meal ll it
was all leavened."
22 And He went through the ci es and
villages, teaching, and journeying toward
Jerusalem.LUKE 13
109
23 Then one said to Him, "Lord, are
there few who are saved?" And He said
to them,
24 "Strive to enter through the narrow
gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to
enter and will not be able.
25 "When once the Master of the house
has risen up and shut the door, and you
begin to stand outside and knock at the
door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open for us,’
and He will answer and say to you, ‘I do
not know you, where you are from,’
26 "then you will begin to say, ‘We ate
and drank in Your presence, and You
taught in our streets.’
27 "But He will say, ‘I tell you I do not
know you, where you are from. Depart
from Me, all you workers of iniquity.’
28 "There will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth, when you see Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob and all the prophetsLUKE 13
110
in the kingdom of God, and yourselves
thrust out.
29 "They will come from the east and
the west, from the north and the south,
and sit down in the kingdom of God.
30 "And indeed there are last who will
be ﬁrst, and there are ﬁrst who will be
last."
31 On that very day some Pharisees
came, saying to Him, "Get out and
depart from here, for Herod wants to kill
You."
32 And He said to them, "Go, tell that
fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and
perform cures today and tomorrow, and
the third day I shall be perfected.’
33 "Nevertheless I must journey today,
tomorrow, and the day following; for it
cannot be that a prophet should perish
outside of Jerusalem.
34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one
who kills the prophets and stones thoseLUKE 13 – 14
111
who are sent to her! How o en I wanted
to gather your children together, as a
hen gathers her brood under her wings,
but you were not willing!
35 "See! Your house is le to you
desolate; and assuredly, I say to you, you
shall not see Me un l the me comes
when you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes
in the name of the LORD!’"
1 Now it happened, as He went
into the house of one of the rulers
of the Pharisees to eat bread on the
Sabbath, that they watched Him closely.
2 And behold, there was a certain man
before Him who had dropsy.
3 And Jesus, answering, spoke to the
lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it
lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
4 But they kept silent. And He took him
and healed him, and let him go.
5 Then He answered them, saying,
"Which of you, having a donkey or an
14LUKE 14
112
ox that has fallen into a pit, will not
immediately pull him out on the Sabbath
day?"
6 And they could not answer Him
regarding these things.
7 So He told a parable to those who
were invited, when He noted how they
chose the best places, saying to them:
8 "When you are invited by anyone to
a wedding feast, do not sit down in the
best place, lest one more honorable
than you be invited by him;
9 "and he who invited you and him
come and say to you, ‘Give place to this
man,’ and then you begin with shame to
take the lowest place.
10 "But when you are invited, go and sit
down in the lowest place, so that when
he who invited you comes he may say to
you, ‘Friend, go up higher.’ Then you will
have glory in the presence of those who
sit at the table with you.LUKE 14
113
11 "For whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and he who humbles himself
will be exalted."
12 Then He also said to him who
invited Him, "When you give a dinner
or a supper, do not ask your friends,
your brothers, your rela ves, nor rich
neighbors, lest they also invite you back,
and you be repaid.
13 "But when you give a feast, invite the
poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.
14 "And you will be blessed, because
they cannot repay you; for you shall be
repaid at the resurrec on of the just."
15 Now when one of those who sat at
the table with Him heard these things,
he said to Him, "Blessed is he who shall
eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
16 Then He said to him, "A certain man
gave a great supper and invited many,LUKE 14
17 "and sent his servant at supper
114
me
to say to those who were invited, ‘Come,
for all things are now ready.’
18 "But they all with one accord began
to make excuses. The ﬁrst said to him,
‘I have bought a piece of ground, and I
must go and see it. I ask you to have me
excused.’
19 "And another said, ‘I have bought
ﬁve yoke of oxen, and I am going to test
them. I ask you to have me excused.’
20 "S ll another said, ‘I have married a
wife, and therefore I cannot come.’
21 "So that servant came and reported
these things to his master. Then the
master of the house, being angry, said
to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the
streets and lanes of the city, and bring in
here the poor and the maimed and the
lame and the blind.’LUKE 14
115
22 "And the servant said, ‘Master, it is
done as you commanded, and s ll there
is room.’
23 "Then the master said to the servant,
‘Go out into the highways and hedges,
and compel them to come in, that my
house may be ﬁlled.
24 ‘For I say to you that none of those
men who were invited shall taste my
supper.’"
25 Now great mul tudes went with
Him. And He turned and said to them,
26 "If anyone comes to Me and does
not hate his father and mother, wife
and children, brothers and sisters, yes,
and his own life also, he cannot be My
disciple.
27 "And whoever does not bear his
cross and come a er Me cannot be My
disciple.
28 "For which of you, intending to build
a tower, does not sit down ﬁrst andLUKE 14
116
count the cost, whether he has enough
to ﬁnish it ––
29 "lest, a er he has laid the founda on,
and is not able to ﬁnish, all who see it
begin to mock him,
30 "saying, ‘This man began to build and
was not able to ﬁnish.’
31 "Or what king, going to make war
against another king, does not sit down
ﬁrst and consider whether he is able with
ten thousand to meet him who comes
against him with twenty thousand?
32 "Or else, while the other is s ll a
great way oﬀ, he sends a delega on and
asks condi ons of peace.
33 "So likewise, whoever of you does
not forsake all that he has cannot be My
disciple.
34 "Salt is good; but if the salt has lost
its ﬂavor, how shall it be seasoned?LUKE 14 – 15
117
35 "It is neither ﬁt for the land nor for
the dunghill, but men throw it out. He
who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
1 Then all the tax collectors and
the sinners drew near to Him to
hear Him.
2 And the Pharisees and scribes
complained, saying, "This Man receives
sinners and eats with them."
3 So He spoke this parable to them,
saying:
4 "What man of you, having a hundred
sheep, if he loses one of them, does not
leave the ninety–nine in the wilderness,
and go a er the one which is lost un l
he ﬁnds it?
5 "And when he has found it, he lays it
on his shoulders, rejoicing.
6 "And when he comes home, he calls
together his friends and neighbors,
saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I
have found my sheep which was lost!’
15LUKE 15
118
7 "I say to you that likewise there will
be more joy in heaven over one sinner
who repents than over ninety–nine just
persons who need no repentance.
8 "Or what woman, having ten silver
coins, if she loses one coin, does not light
a lamp, sweep the house, and search
carefully un l she ﬁnds it?
9 "And when she has found it, she calls
her friends and neighbors together,
saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found
the piece which I lost!’
10 "Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in
the presence of the angels of God over
one sinner who repents."
11 Then He said: "A certain man had
two sons.
12 "And the younger of them said to his
father, ‘Father, give me the por on of
goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to
them his livelihood.LUKE 15
13 "And not many days a
119
er, the
younger son gathered all together,
journeyed to a far country, and there
wasted his possessions with prodigal
living.
14 "But when he had spent all, there
arose a severe famine in that land, and
he began to be in want.
15 "Then he went and joined himself to
a ci zen of that country, and he sent him
into his ﬁelds to feed swine.
16 "And he would gladly have ﬁlled his
stomach with the pods that the swine
ate, and no one gave him anything.
17 "But when he came to himself, he
said, ‘How many of my father’s hired
servants have bread enough and to
spare, and I perish with hunger!
18 ‘I will arise and go to my father, and
will say to him, "Father, I have sinned
against heaven and before you,LUKE 15
120
19 "and I am no longer worthy to be
called your son. Make me like one of
your hired servants."’
20 "And he arose and came to his father.
But when he was s ll a great way oﬀ, his
father saw him and had compassion, and
ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
21 "And the son said to him, ‘Father, I
have sinned against heaven and in your
sight, and am no longer worthy to be
called your son.’
22 "But the father said to his servants,
‘Bring out the best robe and put it on
him, and put a ring on his hand and
sandals on his feet.
23 ‘And bring the fa ed calf here and kill
it, and let us eat and be merry;
24 ‘for this my son was dead and is alive
again; he was lost and is found.’ And
they began to be merry.LUKE 15
121
25 "Now his older son was in the ﬁeld.
And as he came and drew near to the
house, he heard music and dancing.
26 "So he called one of the servants and
asked what these things meant.
27 "And he said to him, ‘Your brother
has come, and because he has received
him safe and sound, your father has
killed the fa ed calf.’
28 "But he was angry and would not go
in. Therefore his father came out and
pleaded with him.
29 "So he answered and said to his
father, ‘Lo, these many years I have been
serving you; I never transgressed your
commandment at any me; and yet you
never gave me a young goat, that I might
make merry with my friends.
30 ‘But as soon as this son of yours
came, who has devoured your livelihood
with harlots, you killed the fa ed calf for
him.’LUKE 15 – 16
122
31 "And he said to him, ‘Son, you are
always with me, and all that I have is
yours.
32 ‘It was right that we should make
merry and be glad, for your brother was
dead and is alive again, and was lost and
is found.’"
1 He also said to His disciples:
"There was a certain rich man
who had a steward, and an accusa on
was brought to him that this man was
was ng his goods.
2 "So he called him and said to him,
‘What is this I hear about you? Give an
account of your stewardship, for you can
no longer be steward.’
3 "Then the steward said within himself,
‘What shall I do? For my master is taking
the stewardship away from me. I cannot
dig; I am ashamed to beg.
16LUKE 16
123
4 ‘I have resolved what to do, that when
I am put out of the stewardship, they
may receive me into their houses.’
5 "So he called every one of his master’s
debtors to him, and said to the ﬁrst,
‘How much do you owe my master?’
6 "And he said, ‘A hundred measures
of oil.’ So he said to him, ‘Take your bill,
and sit down quickly and write ﬁ y.’
7 "Then he said to another, ‘And how
much do you owe?’ So he said, ‘A
hundred measures of wheat.’ And he
said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write
eighty.’
8 "So the master commended the
unjust steward because he had dealt
shrewdly. For the sons of this world are
more shrewd in their genera on than
the sons of light.
9 "And I say to you, make friends for
yourselves by unrighteous mammon,LUKE 16
124
that when you fail, they may receive you
into an everlas ng home.
10 "He who is faithful in what is least
is faithful also in much; and he who is
unjust in what is least is unjust also in
much.
11 "Therefore if you have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
who will commit to your trust the true
riches?
12 "And if you have not been faithful in
what is another man’s, who will give you
what is your own?
13 "No servant can serve two masters;
for either he will hate the one and love
the other, or else he will be loyal to the
one and despise the other. You cannot
serve God and mammon."
14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers
of money, also heard all these things,
and they derided Him.LUKE 16
125
15 And He said to them, "You are those
who jus fy yourselves before men,
but God knows your hearts. For what
is highly esteemed among men is an
abomina on in the sight of God.
16 "The law and the prophets were un l
John. Since that me the kingdom of
God has been preached, and everyone is
pressing into it.
17 "And it is easier for heaven and earth
to pass away than for one le of the
law to fail.
18 "Whoever divorces his wife and
marries another commits adultery; and
whoever marries her who is divorced
from her husband commits adultery.
19 "There was a certain rich man who
was clothed in purple and ﬁne linen and
fared sumptuously every day.
20 "But there was a certain beggar
named Lazarus, full of sores, who was
laid at his gate,LUKE 16
126
21 "desiring to be fed with the crumbs
which fell from the rich man’s table.
Moreover the dogs came and licked his
sores.
22 "So it was that the beggar died, and
was carried by the angels to Abraham’s
bosom. The rich man also died and was
buried.
23 "And being in torments in Hades, he
li ed up his eyes and saw Abraham afar
oﬀ, and Lazarus in his bosom.
24 "Then he cried and said, ‘Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus that he may dip the p of his
ﬁnger in water and cool my tongue; for I
am tormented in this ﬂame.’
25 "But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember
that in your life me you received your
good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
things; but now he is comforted and you
are tormented.LUKE 16
127
26 ‘And besides all this, between us and
you there is a great gulf ﬁxed, so that
those who want to pass from here to
you cannot, nor can those from there
pass to us.’
27 "Then he said, ‘I beg you therefore,
father, that you would send him to my
father’s house,
28 ‘for I have ﬁve brothers, that he may
tes fy to them, lest they also come to
this place of torment.’
29 "Abraham said to him, ‘They have
Moses and the prophets; let them hear
them.’
30 "And he said, ‘No, father Abraham;
but if one goes to them from the dead,
they will repent.’
31 "But he said to him, ‘If they do not
hear Moses and the prophets, neither
will they be persuaded though one rise
from the dead.’"LUKE 17
17
128
1 Then He said to the disciples,
"It is impossible that no oﬀenses
should come, but woe to him through
whom they do come!
2 "It would be be er for him if a
millstone were hung around his neck,
and he were thrown into the sea, than
that he should oﬀend one of these li le
ones.
3 "Take heed to yourselves. If your
brother sins against you, rebuke him;
and if he repents, forgive him.
4 "And if he sins against you seven
mes in a day, and seven mes in a day
returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you
shall forgive him."
5 And the apostles said to the Lord,
"Increase our faith."
6 So the Lord said, "If you have faith
as a mustard seed, you can say to this
mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled up by the rootsLUKE 17
129
and be planted in the sea,’ and it would
obey you.
7 "And which of you, having a servant
plowing or tending sheep, will say to
him when he has come in from the ﬁeld,
‘Come at once and sit down to eat’?
8 "But will he not rather say to him,
‘Prepare something for my supper, and
gird yourself and serve me ll I have
eaten and drunk, and a erward you will
eat and drink’?
9 "Does he thank that servant because
he did the things that were commanded
him? I think not.
10 "So likewise you, when you have
done all those things which you are
commanded, say, ‘We are unproﬁtable
servants. We have done what was our
duty to do.’"
11 Now it happened as He went to
Jerusalem that He passed through the
midst of Samaria and Galilee.LUKE 17
130
12 Then as He entered a certain village,
there met Him ten men who were lepers,
who stood afar oﬀ.
13 And they li ed up their voices and
said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
14 So when He saw them, He said to
them, "Go, show yourselves to the
priests." And so it was that as they went,
they were cleansed.
15 And one of them, when he saw that
he was healed, returned, and with a loud
voice gloriﬁed God,
16 and fell down on his face at His
feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a
Samaritan.
17 So Jesus answered and said, "Were
there not ten cleansed? But where are
the nine?
18 "Were there not any found who
returned to give glory to God except this
foreigner?"LUKE 17
131
19 And He said to him, "Arise, go your
way. Your faith has made you well."
20 Now when He was asked by the
Pharisees when the kingdom of God
would come, He answered them and
said, "The kingdom of God does not
come with observa on;
21 "nor will they say, ‘See here!’ or ‘See
there!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God
is within you."
22 Then He said to the disciples, "The
days will come when you will desire to
see one of the days of the Son of Man,
and you will not see it.
23 "And they will say to you, ‘Look here!’
or ‘Look there!’ Do not go a er them or
follow them.
24 "For as the lightning that ﬂashes out
of one part under heaven shines to the
other part under heaven, so also the Son
of Man will be in His day.LUKE 17
132
25 "But ﬁrst He must suﬀer many things
and be rejected by this genera on.
26 "And as it was in the days of Noah, so
it will be also in the days of the Son of
Man:
27 "They ate, they drank, they married
wives, they were given in marriage, un l
the day that Noah entered the ark, and
the ﬂood came and destroyed them all.
28 "Likewise as it was also in the days of
Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought,
they sold, they planted, they built;
29 "but on the day that Lot went out of
Sodom it rained ﬁre and brimstone from
heaven and destroyed them all.
30 "Even so will it be in the day when
the Son of Man is revealed.
31 "In that day, he who is on the
housetop, and his goods are in the
house, let him not come down to take
them away. And likewise the one who is
in the ﬁeld, let him not turn back.LUKE 17 – 18
133
32 "Remember Lot’s wife.
33 "Whoever seeks to save his life will
lose it, and whoever loses his life will
preserve it.
34 "I tell you, in that night there will
be two men in one bed: the one will be
taken and the other will be le .
35 "Two women will be grinding
together: the one will be taken and the
other le .
36 "Two men will be in the ﬁeld: the one
will be taken and the other le ."
37 And they answered and said to Him,
"Where, Lord?" So He said to them,
"Wherever the body is, there the eagles
will be gathered together."
1 Then He spoke a parable to
them, that men always ought to
pray and not lose heart,
2 saying: "There was in a certain city a
judge who did not fear God nor regard
man.
18LUKE 18
134
3 "Now there was a widow in that city;
and she came to him, saying, ‘Get jus ce
for me from my adversary.’
4 "And he would not for a while;
but a erward he said within himself,
‘Though I do not fear God nor regard
man,
5 ‘yet because this widow troubles me
I will avenge her, lest by her con nual
coming she weary me.’"
6 Then the Lord said, "Hear what the
unjust judge said.
7 "And shall God not avenge His own
elect who cry out day and night to Him,
though He bears long with them?
8 "I tell you that He will avenge them
speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of
Man comes, will He really ﬁnd faith on
the earth?"
9 Also He spoke this parable to some
who trusted in themselves that they
were righteous, and despised others:LUKE 18
135
10 "Two men went up to the temple to
pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax
collector.
11 "The Pharisee stood and prayed thus
with himself, ‘God, I thank You that I
am not like other men––extor oners,
unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax
collector.
12 ‘I fast twice a week; I give thes of all
that I possess.’
13 "And the tax collector, standing afar
oﬀ, would not so much as raise his eyes
to heaven, but beat his breast, saying,
‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’
14 "I tell you, this man went down to
his house jus ﬁed rather than the other;
for everyone who exalts himself will be
humbled, and he who humbles himself
will be exalted."
15 Then they also brought infants to
Him that He might touch them; butLUKE 18
136
when the disciples saw it, they rebuked
them.
16 But Jesus called them to Him and
said, "Let the li le children come to Me,
and do not forbid them; for of such is
the kingdom of God.
17 "Assuredly, I say to you, whoever
does not receive the kingdom of God as
a li le child will by no means enter it."
18 Now a certain ruler asked Him,
saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?"
19 So Jesus said to him, "Why do you
call Me good? No one is good but One,
that is, God.
20 "You know the commandments: ‘Do
not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’
‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’
‘Honor your father and your mother.’"
21 And he said, "All these things I have
kept from my youth."LUKE 18
137
22 So when Jesus heard these things,
He said to him, "You s ll lack one thing.
Sell all that you have and distribute to
the poor, and you will have treasure in
heaven; and come, follow Me."
23 But when he heard this, he became
very sorrowful, for he was very rich.
24 And when Jesus saw that he became
very sorrowful, He said, "How hard it is
for those who have riches to enter the
kingdom of God!
25 "For it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
26 And those who heard it said, "Who
then can be saved?"
27 But He said, "The things which are
impossible with men are possible with
God."
28 Then Peter said, "See, we have le all
and followed You."LUKE 18
138
29 So He said to them, "Assuredly, I
say to you, there is no one who has le
house or parents or brothers or wife or
children, for the sake of the kingdom of
God,
30 "who shall not receive many mes
more in this present me, and in the age
to come eternal life."
31 Then He took the twelve aside and
said to them, "Behold, we are going up
to Jerusalem, and all things that are
wri en by the prophets concerning the
Son of Man will be accomplished.
32 "For He will be delivered to the
Gen les and will be mocked and insulted
and spit upon.
33 "They will scourge Him and kill Him.
And the third day He will rise again."
34 But they understood none of these
things; this saying was hidden from
them, and they did not know the things
which were spoken.LUKE 18
139
35 Then it happened, as He was coming
near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat
by the road begging.
36 And hearing a mul tude passing by,
he asked what it meant.
37 So they told him that Jesus of
Nazareth was passing by.
38 And he cried out, saying, "Jesus, Son
of David, have mercy on me!"
39 Then those who went before warned
him that he should be quiet; but he cried
out all the more, "Son of David, have
mercy on me!"
40 So Jesus stood s ll and commanded
him to be brought to Him. And when he
had come near, He asked him,
41 saying, "What do you want Me to
do for you?" He said, "Lord, that I may
receive my sight."
42 Then Jesus said to him, "Receive your
sight; your faith has made you well."LUKE 18 – 19
140
43 And immediately he received his
sight, and followed Him, glorifying God.
And all the people, when they saw it,
gave praise to God.
1 Then Jesus entered and passed
through Jericho.
2 Now behold, there was a man named
Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector,
and he was rich.
3 And he sought to see who Jesus was,
but could not because of the crowd, for
he was of short stature.
4 So he ran ahead and climbed up into
a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was
going to pass that way.
5 And when Jesus came to the place,
He looked up and saw him, and said
to him, "Zacchaeus, make haste and
come down, for today I must stay at your
house."
6 So he made haste and came down,
and received Him joyfully.
19LUKE 19
141
7 But when they saw it, they all
complained, saying, "He has gone to be
a guest with a man who is a sinner."
8 Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the
Lord, "Look, Lord, I give half of my goods
to the poor; and if I have taken anything
from anyone by false accusa on, I
restore fourfold."
9 And Jesus said to him, "Today salva on
has come to this house, because he also
is a son of Abraham;
10 "for the Son of Man has come to seek
and to save that which was lost."
11 Now as they heard these things,
He spoke another parable, because He
was near Jerusalem and because they
thought the kingdom of God would
appear immediately.
12 Therefore He said: "A certain
nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom and to
return.LUKE 19
142
13 "So he called ten of his servants,
delivered to them ten minas, and said to
them, ‘Do business ll I come.’
14 "But his ci zens hated him, and sent
a delega on a er him, saying, ‘We will
not have this man to reign over us.’
15 "And so it was that when he returned,
having received the kingdom, he then
commanded these servants, to whom
he had given the money, to be called
to him, that he might know how much
every man had gained by trading.
16 "Then came the ﬁrst, saying, ‘Master,
your mina has earned ten minas.’
17 "And he said to him, ‘Well done,
good servant; because you were faithful
in a very li le, have authority over ten
ci es.’
18 "And the second came, saying,
‘Master, your mina has earned ﬁve
minas.’LUKE 19
143
19 "Likewise he said to him, ‘You also be
over ﬁve ci es.’
20 "Then another came, saying, ‘Master,
here is your mina, which I have kept put
away in a handkerchief.
21 ‘For I feared you, because you are an
austere man. You collect what you did
not deposit, and reap what you did not
sow.’
22 "And he said to him, ‘Out of your
own mouth I will judge you, you wicked
servant. You knew that I was an austere
man, collec ng what I did not deposit
and reaping what I did not sow.
23 ‘Why then did you not put my money
in the bank, that at my coming I might
have collected it with interest?’
24 "And he said to those who stood by,
‘Take the mina from him, and give it to
him who has ten minas.’
25 ("But they said to him, ‘Master, he
has ten minas.’)LUKE 19
144
26 ‘For I say to you, that to everyone
who has will be given; and from him who
does not have, even what he has will be
taken away from him.
27 ‘But bring here those enemies of
mine, who did not want me to reign over
them, and slay them before me.’"
28 When He had said this, He went on
ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29 And it came to pass, when He came
near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the
mountain called Olivet, that He sent two
of His disciples,
30 saying, "Go into the village opposite
you, where as you enter you will ﬁnd a
colt ed, on which no one has ever sat.
Loose it and bring it here.
31 "And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are
you loosing it?’ thus you shall say to him,
‘Because the Lord has need of it.’"LUKE 19
145
32 So those who were sent went their
way and found it just as He had said to
them.
33 But as they were loosing the colt, the
owners of it said to them, "Why are you
loosing the colt?"
34 And they said, "The Lord has need of
him."
35 Then they brought him to Jesus. And
they threw their own clothes on the colt,
and they set Jesus on him.
36 And as He went, many spread their
clothes on the road.
37 Then, as He was now drawing near
the descent of the Mount of Olives, the
whole mul tude of the disciples began
to rejoice and praise God with a loud
voice for all the mighty works they had
seen,
38 saying: "‘Blessed is the King who
comes in the name of the LORD!’ Peace
in heaven and glory in the highest!"LUKE 19
146
39 And some of the Pharisees called to
Him from the crowd, "Teacher, rebuke
Your disciples."
40 But He answered and said to them, "I
tell you that if these should keep silent,
the stones would immediately cry out."
41 Now as He drew near, He saw the city
and wept over it,
42 saying, "If you had known, even you,
especially in this your day, the things
that make for your peace! But now they
are hidden from your eyes.
43 "For days will come upon you when
your enemies will build an embankment
around you, surround you and close you
in on every side,
44 "and level you, and your children
within you, to the ground; and they will
not leave in you one stone upon another,
because you did not know the me of
your visita on."LUKE 19 – 20
147
45 Then He went into the temple and
began to drive out those who bought
and sold in it,
46 saying to them, "It is wri en, ‘My
house is a house of prayer,’ but you have
made it a ‘den of thieves.’"
47 And He was teaching daily in the
temple. But the chief priests, the scribes,
and the leaders of the people sought to
destroy Him,
48 and were unable to do anything; for
all the people were very a en ve to
hear Him.
1 Now it happened on one of
those days, as He taught the
people in the temple and preached
the gospel, that the chief priests and
the scribes, together with the elders,
confronted Him
2 and spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us,
by what authority are You doing these
20LUKE 20
148
things? Or who is he who gave You this
authority?"
3 But He answered and said to them, "I
also will ask you one thing, and answer
Me:
4 "The bap sm of John––was it from
heaven or from men?"
5 And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, "If we say,
‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then
did you not believe him?’
6 "But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the
people will stone us, for they are
persuaded that John was a prophet."
7 So they answered that they did not
know where it was from.
8 And Jesus said to them, "Neither will
I tell you by what authority I do these
things."
9 Then He began to tell the people
this parable: "A certain man planted aLUKE 20
149
vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and
went into a far country for a long me.
10 "Now at vintage– me he sent a
servant to the vinedressers, that they
might give him some of the fruit of the
vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him
and sent him away empty–handed.
11 "Again he sent another servant;
and they beat him also, treated
him shamefully, and sent him away
empty–handed.
12 "And again he sent a third; and they
wounded him also and cast him out.
13 "Then the owner of the vineyard
said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my
beloved son. Probably they will respect
him when they see him.’
14 "But when the vinedressers saw
him, they reasoned among themselves,
saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill
him, that the inheritance may be ours.’LUKE 20
150
15 "So they cast him out of the vineyard
and killed him. Therefore what will the
owner of the vineyard do to them?
16 "He will come and destroy those
vinedressers and give the vineyard to
others." And when they heard it they
said, "Certainly not!"
17 Then He looked at them and said,
"What then is this that is wri en: ‘The
stone which the builders rejected Has
become the chief cornerstone’?
18 "Whoever falls on that stone will be
broken; but on whomever it falls, it will
grind him to powder."
19 And the chief priests and the scribes
that very hour sought to lay hands on
Him, but they feared the people––for
they knew He had spoken this parable
against them.
20 So they watched Him, and sent spies
who pretended to be righteous, that
they might seize on His words, in orderLUKE 20
151
to deliver Him to the power and the
authority of the governor.
21 Then they asked Him, saying,
"Teacher, we know that You say and
teach rightly, and You do not show
personal favori sm, but teach the way
of God in truth:
22 "Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to
Caesar or not?"
23 But He perceived their cra iness,
and said to them, "Why do you test Me?
24 "Show Me a denarius. Whose image
and inscrip on does it have?" They
answered and said, "Caesar’s."
25 And He said to them, "Render
therefore to Caesar the things that are
Caesar’s, and to God the things that are
God’s."
26 But they could not catch Him in His
words in the presence of the people.
And they marveled at His answer and
kept silent.LUKE 20
152
27 Then some of the Sadducees, who
deny that there is a resurrec on, came
to Him and asked Him,
28 saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote to us
that if a man’s brother dies, having a
wife, and he dies without children, his
brother should take his wife and raise up
oﬀspring for his brother.
29 "Now there were seven brothers.
And the ﬁrst took a wife, and died
without children.
30 "And the second took her as wife,
and he died childless.
31 "Then the third took her, and in like
manner the seven also; and they le no
children, and died.
32 "Last of all the woman died also.
33 "Therefore, in the resurrec on,
whose wife does she become? For all
seven had her as wife."LUKE 20
153
34 And Jesus answered and said to
them, "The sons of this age marry and
are given in marriage.
35 "But those who are counted worthy
to a ain that age, and the resurrec on
from the dead, neither marry nor are
given in marriage;
36 "nor can they die anymore, for they
are equal to the angels and are sons of
God, being sons of the resurrec on.
37 "But even Moses showed in the
burning bush passage that the dead are
raised, when he called the Lord ‘the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob.’
38 "For He is not the God of the dead
but of the living, for all live to Him."
39 Then some of the scribes answered
and said, "Teacher, You have spoken
well."
40 But a er that they dared not
ques on Him anymore.LUKE 20 – 21
154
41 And He said to them, "How can they
say that the Christ is the Son of David?
42 "Now David himself said in the Book
of Psalms: ‘The LORD said to my Lord,
"Sit at My right hand,
43 Till I make Your enemies Your
footstool."’
44 "Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord’;
how is He then his Son?"
45 Then, in the hearing of all the people,
He said to His disciples,
46 "Beware of the scribes, who desire to
go around in long robes, love gree ngs
in the marketplaces, the best seats in
the synagogues, and the best places at
feasts,
47 "who devour widows’ houses, and
for a pretense make long prayers. These
will receive greater condemna on."
1 And He looked up and saw the
rich pu ng their gi s into the
treasury,
21LUKE 21
155
2 and He saw also a certain poor widow
pu ng in two mites.
3 So He said, "Truly I say to you that this
poor widow has put in more than all;
4 "for all these out of their abundance
have put in oﬀerings for God, but she out
of her poverty put in all the livelihood
that she had."
5 Then, as some spoke of the temple,
how it was adorned with beau ful
stones and dona ons, He said,
6 "These things which you see––the
days will come in which not one stone
shall be le upon another that shall not
be thrown down."
7 So they asked Him, saying, "Teacher,
but when will these things be? And what
sign will there be when these things are
about to take place?"
8 And He said: "Take heed that you not
be deceived. For many will come in My
name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The meLUKE 21
156
has drawn near.’ Therefore do not go
a er them.
9 "But when you hear of wars and
commo ons, do not be terriﬁed; for
these things must come to pass ﬁrst, but
the end will not come immediately."
10 Then He said to them, "Na on will
rise against na on, and kingdom against
kingdom.
11 "And there will be great earthquakes
in various places, and famines and
pes lences; and there will be fearful
sights and great signs from heaven.
12 "But before all these things, they will
lay their hands on you and persecute
you, delivering you up to the synagogues
and prisons. You will be brought before
kings and rulers for My name’s sake.
13 "But it will turn out for you as an
occasion for tes mony.LUKE 21
14 "Therefore se
157
le it in your hearts not
to meditate beforehand on what you will
answer;
15 "for I will give you a mouth and
wisdom which all your adversaries will
not be able to contradict or resist.
16 "You will be betrayed even by parents
and brothers, rela ves and friends; and
they will put some of you to death.
17 "And you will be hated by all for My
name’s sake.
18 "But not a hair of your head shall be
lost.
19 "By your pa ence possess your souls.
20 "But when you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies, then know that
its desola on is near.
21 "Then let those who are in Judea
ﬂee to the mountains, let those who are
in the midst of her depart, and let not
those who are in the country enter her.LUKE 21
158
22 "For these are the days of vengeance,
that all things which are wri en may be
fulﬁlled.
23 "But woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who are nursing babies
in those days! For there will be great
distress in the land and wrath upon this
people.
24 "And they will fall by the edge of
the sword, and be led away cap ve
into all na ons. And Jerusalem will be
trampled by Gen les un l the mes of
the Gen les are fulﬁlled.
25 "And there will be signs in the sun, in
the moon, and in the stars; and on the
earth distress of na ons, with perplexity,
the sea and the waves roaring;
26 "men’s hearts failing them from fear
and the expecta on of those things
which are coming on the earth, for the
powers of heaven will be shaken.LUKE 21
159
27 "Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great
glory.
28 "Now when these things begin to
happen, look up and li up your heads,
because your redemp on draws near."
29 Then He spoke to them a parable:
"Look at the ﬁg tree, and all the trees.
30 "When they are already budding,
you see and know for yourselves that
summer is now near.
31 "So you also, when you see these
things happening, know that the
kingdom of God is near.
32 "Assuredly, I say to you, this
genera on will by no means pass away
ll all things take place.
33 "Heaven and earth will pass away,
but My words will by no means pass
away.
34 "But take heed to yourselves, lest
your hearts be weighed down withLUKE 21 – 22
160
carousing, drunkenness, and cares of
this life, and that Day come on you
unexpectedly.
35 "For it will come as a snare on all
those who dwell on the face of the
whole earth.
36 "Watch therefore, and pray always
that you may be counted worthy to
escape all these things that will come
to pass, and to stand before the Son of
Man."
37 And in the day me He was teaching
in the temple, but at night He went
out and stayed on the mountain called
Olivet.
38 Then early in the morning all the
people came to Him in the temple to
hear Him.
1 Now the Feast of Unleavened
Bread drew near, which is called
Passover.
22LUKE 22
161
2 And the chief priests and the scribes
sought how they might kill Him, for they
feared the people.
3 Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed
Iscariot, who was numbered among the
twelve.
4 So he went his way and conferred
with the chief priests and captains, how
he might betray Him to them.
5 And they were glad, and agreed to
give him money.
6 So he promised and sought
opportunity to betray Him to them in
the absence of the mul tude.
7 Then came the Day of Unleavened
Bread, when the Passover must be killed.
8 And He sent Peter and John, saying,
"Go and prepare the Passover for us,
that we may eat."
9 So they said to Him, "Where do You
want us to prepare?"LUKE 22
162
10 And He said to them, "Behold, when
you have entered the city, a man will
meet you carrying a pitcher of water;
follow him into the house which he
enters.
11 "Then you shall say to the master
of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you,
"Where is the guest room where I may
eat the Passover with My disciples?"’
12 "Then he will show you a large,
furnished upper room; there make
ready."
13 So they went and found it just as He
had said to them, and they prepared the
Passover.
14 When the hour had come, He sat
down, and the twelve apostles with Him.
15 Then He said to them, "With fervent
desire I have desired to eat this Passover
with you before I suﬀer;LUKE 22
163
16 "for I say to you, I will no longer eat
of it un l it is fulﬁlled in the kingdom of
God."
17 Then He took the cup, and gave
thanks, and said, "Take this and divide it
among yourselves;
18 "for I say to you, I will not drink of
the fruit of the vine un l the kingdom of
God comes."
19 And He took bread, gave thanks and
broke it, and gave it to them, saying,
"This is My body which is given for you;
do this in remembrance of Me."
20 Likewise He also took the cup a er
supper, saying, "This cup is the new
covenant in My blood, which is shed for
you.
21 "But behold, the hand of My betrayer
is with Me on the table.
22 "And truly the Son of Man goes as it
has been determined, but woe to that
man by whom He is betrayed!"LUKE 22
23 Then they began to ques
164
on among
themselves, which of them it was who
would do this thing.
24 Now there was also a dispute among
them, as to which of them should be
considered the greatest.
25 And He said to them, "The kings of
the Gen les exercise lordship over them,
and those who exercise authority over
them are called ‘benefactors.’
26 "But not so among you; on the
contrary, he who is greatest among you,
let him be as the younger, and he who
governs as he who serves.
27 "For who is greater, he who sits at
the table, or he who serves? Is it not he
who sits at the table? Yet I am among
you as the One who serves.
28 "But you are those who have
con nued with Me in My trials.LUKE 22
165
29 "And I bestow upon you a kingdom,
just as My Father bestowed one upon
Me,
30 "that you may eat and drink at My
table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones
judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
31 And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon!
Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he
may si you as wheat.
32 "But I have prayed for you, that your
faith should not fail; and when you
have returned to Me, strengthen your
brethren."
33 But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready
to go with You, both to prison and to
death."
34 Then He said, "I tell you, Peter, the
rooster shall not crow this day before
you will deny three mes that you know
Me."
35 And He said to them, "When I sent
you without money bag, knapsack, andLUKE 22
166
sandals, did you lack anything?" So they
said, "Nothing."
36 Then He said to them, "But now, he
who has a money bag, let him take it,
and likewise a knapsack; and he who has
no sword, let him sell his garment and
buy one.
37 "For I say to you that this which is
wri en must s ll be accomplished in
Me: ‘And He was numbered with the
transgressors.’ For the things concerning
Me have an end."
38 So they said, "Lord, look, here are
two swords." And He said to them, "It is
enough."
39 Coming out, He went to the Mount
of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His
disciples also followed Him.
40 When He came to the place, He said
to them, "Pray that you may not enter
into tempta on."LUKE 22
167
41 And He was withdrawn from them
about a stone’s throw, and He knelt
down and prayed,
42 saying, "Father, if it is Your will, take
this cup away from Me; nevertheless not
My will, but Yours, be done."
43 Then an angel appeared to Him from
heaven, strengthening Him.
44 And being in agony, He prayed more
earnestly. Then His sweat became like
great drops of blood falling down to the
ground.
45 When He rose up from prayer, and
had come to His disciples, He found
them sleeping from sorrow.
46 Then He said to them, "Why do you
sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into
tempta on."
47 And while He was s ll speaking,
behold, a mul tude; and he who was
called Judas, one of the twelve, wentLUKE 22
168
before them and drew near to Jesus to
kiss Him.
48 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you
betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
49 When those around Him saw what
was going to happen, they said to Him,
"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
50 And one of them struck the servant
of the high priest and cut oﬀ his right
ear.
51 But Jesus answered and said, "Permit
even this." And He touched his ear and
healed him.
52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
captains of the temple, and the elders
who had come to Him, "Have you come
out, as against a robber, with swords and
clubs?
53 "When I was with you daily in the
temple, you did not try to seize Me.
But this is your hour, and the power of
darkness."LUKE 22
169
54 Having arrested Him, they led Him
and brought Him into the high priest’s
house. But Peter followed at a distance.
55 Now when they had kindled a ﬁre in
the midst of the courtyard and sat down
together, Peter sat among them.
56 And a certain servant girl, seeing him
as he sat by the ﬁre, looked intently at
him and said, "This man was also with
Him."
57 But he denied Him, saying, "Woman,
I do not know Him."
58 And a er a li le while another saw
him and said, "You also are of them." But
Peter said, "Man, I am not!"
59 Then a er about an hour had passed,
another conﬁdently aﬃrmed, saying,
"Surely this fellow also was with Him, for
he is a Galilean."
60 But Peter said, "Man, I do not know
what you are saying!" Immediately,LUKE 22
170
while he was s ll speaking, the rooster
crowed.
61 And the Lord turned and looked at
Peter. And Peter remembered the word
of the Lord, how He had said to him,
"Before the rooster crows, you will deny
Me three mes."
62 So Peter went out and wept bi erly.
63 Now the men who held Jesus mocked
Him and beat Him.
64 And having blindfolded Him, they
struck Him on the face and asked Him,
saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck You?"
65 And many other things they
blasphemously spoke against Him.
66 As soon as it was day, the elders
of the people, both chief priests and
scribes, came together and led Him into
their council, saying,LUKE 22 – 23
171
67 "If You are the Christ, tell us." But He
said to them, "If I tell you, you will by no
means believe.
68 "And if I also ask you, you will by no
means answer Me or let Me go.
69 "Herea er the Son of Man will sit on
the right hand of the power of God."
70 Then they all said, "Are You then the
Son of God?" So He said to them, "You
rightly say that I am."
71 And they said, "What further
tes mony do we need? For we have
heard it ourselves from His own mouth."
1 Then the whole mul tude of
them arose and led Him to Pilate.
2 And they began to accuse Him, saying,
"We found this fellow perver ng the
na on, and forbidding to pay taxes to
Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ,
a King."
23LUKE 23
172
3 Then Pilate asked Him, saying, "Are
You the King of the Jews?" He answered
him and said, "It is as you say."
4 So Pilate said to the chief priests and
the crowd, "I ﬁnd no fault in this Man."
5 But they were the more ﬁerce,
saying, "He s rs up the people, teaching
throughout all Judea, beginning from
Galilee to this place."
6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked
if the Man were a Galilean.
7 And as soon as he knew that He
belonged to Herod’s jurisdic on, he sent
Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem
at that me.
8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was
exceedingly glad; for he had desired for
a long me to see Him, because he had
heard many things about Him, and he
hoped to see some miracle done by Him.
9 Then he ques oned Him with many
words, but He answered him nothing.LUKE 23
173
10 And the chief priests and scribes
stood and vehemently accused Him.
11 Then Herod, with his men of war,
treated Him with contempt and mocked
Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe,
and sent Him back to Pilate.
12 That very day Pilate and Herod
became friends with each other, for
previously they had been at enmity with
each other.
13 Then Pilate, when he had called
together the chief priests, the rulers, and
the people,
14 said to them, "You have brought this
Man to me, as one who misleads the
people. And indeed, having examined
Him in your presence, I have found no
fault in this Man concerning those things
of which you accuse Him;
15 "no, neither did Herod, for I sent
you back to him; and indeed nothingLUKE 23
174
deserving of death has been done by
Him.
16 "I will therefore chas se Him and
release Him"
17 (for it was necessary for him to
release one to them at the feast).
18 And they all cried out at once, saying,
"Away with this Man, and release to us
Barabbas" ––
19 who had been thrown into prison for
a certain rebellion made in the city, and
for murder.
20 Pilate, therefore, wishing to release
Jesus, again called out to them.
21 But they shouted, saying, "Crucify
Him, crucify Him!"
22 Then he said to them the third me,
"Why, what evil has He done? I have
found no reason for death in Him. I will
therefore chas se Him and let Him go."
23 But they were insistent, demanding
with loud voices that He be cruciﬁed.LUKE 23
175
And the voices of these men and of the
chief priests prevailed.
24 So Pilate gave sentence that it should
be as they requested.
25 And he released to them the one
they requested, who for rebellion and
murder had been thrown into prison;
but he delivered Jesus to their will.
26 Now as they led Him away, they laid
hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian,
who was coming from the country, and
on him they laid the cross that he might
bear it a er Jesus.
27 And a great mul tude of the people
followed Him, and women who also
mourned and lamented Him.
28 But Jesus, turning to them, said,
"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep
for Me, but weep for yourselves and for
your children.
29 "For indeed the days are coming in
which they will say, ‘Blessed are theLUKE 23
176
barren, wombs that never bore, and
breasts which never nursed!’
30 "Then they will begin ‘to say to the
mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills,
"Cover us!"’
31 "For if they do these things in the
green wood, what will be done in the
dry?"
32 There were also two others,
criminals, led with Him to be put to
death.
33 And when they had come to the
place called Calvary, there they cruciﬁed
Him, and the criminals, one on the right
hand and the other on the le .
34 Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive
them, for they do not know what they
do." And they divided His garments and
cast lots.
35 And the people stood looking on.
But even the rulers with them sneered,
saying, "He saved others; let Him saveLUKE 23
177
Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of
God."
36 The soldiers also mocked Him,
coming and oﬀering Him sour wine,
37 and saying, "If You are the King of the
Jews, save Yourself."
38 And an inscrip on also was wri en
over Him in le ers of Greek, La n, and
Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
39 Then one of the criminals who were
hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You
are the Christ, save Yourself and us."
40 But the other, answering, rebuked
him, saying, "Do you not even fear
God, seeing you are under the same
condemna on?
41 "And we indeed justly, for we receive
the due reward of our deeds; but this
Man has done nothing wrong."
42 Then he said to Jesus, "Lord,
remember me when You come into Your
kingdom."LUKE 23
178
43 And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I
say to you, today you will be with Me in
Paradise."
44 Now it was about the sixth hour, and
there was darkness over all the earth
un l the ninth hour.
45 Then the sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was torn in two.
46 And when Jesus had cried out with a
loud voice, He said, "Father, ‘into Your
hands I commit My spirit.’" Having said
this, He breathed His last.
47 So when the centurion saw what
had happened, he gloriﬁed God, saying,
"Certainly this was a righteous Man!"
48 And the whole crowd who came
together to that sight, seeing what
had been done, beat their breasts and
returned.
49 But all His acquaintances, and the
women who followed Him from Galilee,LUKE 23
179
stood at a distance, watching these
things.
50 Now behold, there was a man named
Joseph, a council member, a good and
just man.
51 He had not consented to their
decision and deed. He was from
Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who
himself was also wai ng for the kingdom
of God.
52 This man went to Pilate and asked for
the body of Jesus.
53 Then he took it down, wrapped it
in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was
hewn out of the rock, where no one had
ever lain before.
54 That day was the Prepara on, and
the Sabbath drew near.
55 And the women who had come with
Him from Galilee followed a er, and
they observed the tomb and how His
body was laid.LUKE 23 – 24
180
56 Then they returned and prepared
spices and fragrant oils. And they
rested on the Sabbath according to the
commandment.
1 Now on the ﬁrst day of the
week, very early in the morning,
they, and certain other women with
them, came to the tomb bringing the
spices which they had prepared.
2 But they found the stone rolled away
from the tomb.
3 Then they went in and did not ﬁnd the
body of the Lord Jesus.
4 And it happened, as they were greatly
perplexed about this, that behold, two
men stood by them in shining garments.
5 Then, as they were afraid and bowed
their faces to the earth, they said to
them, "Why do you seek the living
among the dead?
24LUKE 24
181
6 "He is not here, but is risen!
Remember how He spoke to you when
He was s ll in Galilee,
7 "saying, ‘The Son of Man must be
delivered into the hands of sinful men,
and be cruciﬁed, and the third day rise
again.’"
8 And they remembered His words.
9 Then they returned from the tomb
and told all these things to the eleven
and to all the rest.
10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna,
Mary the mother of James, and the
other women with them, who told these
things to the apostles.
11 And their words seemed to them like
idle tales, and they did not believe them.
12 But Peter arose and ran to the tomb;
and stooping down, he saw the linen
cloths lying by themselves; and he
departed, marveling to himself at what
had happened.LUKE 24
182
13 Now behold, two of them were
traveling that same day to a village called
Emmaus, which was seven miles from
Jerusalem.
14 And they talked together of all these
things which had happened.
15 So it was, while they conversed and
reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near
and went with them.
16 But their eyes were restrained, so
that they did not know Him.
17 And He said to them, "What kind of
conversa on is this that you have with
one another as you walk and are sad?"
18 Then the one whose name was
Cleopas answered and said to Him, "Are
You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and
have You not known the things which
happened there in these days?"
19 And He said to them, "What things?"
So they said to Him, "The things
concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was aLUKE 24
183
Prophet mighty in deed and word before
God and all the people,
20 "and how the chief priests and our
rulers delivered Him to be condemned
to death, and cruciﬁed Him.
21 "But we were hoping that it was He
who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed,
besides all this, today is the third day
since these things happened.
22 "Yes, and certain women of our
company, who arrived at the tomb early,
astonished us.
23 "When they did not ﬁnd His body,
they came saying that they had also seen
a vision of angels who said He was alive.
24 "And certain of those who were with
us went to the tomb and found it just as
the women had said; but Him they did
not see."
25 Then He said to them, "O foolish
ones, and slow of heart to believe in all
that the prophets have spoken!LUKE 24
184
26 "Ought not the Christ to have
suﬀered these things and to enter into
His glory?"
27 And beginning at Moses and all the
Prophets, He expounded to them in all
the Scriptures the things concerning
Himself.
28 Then they drew near to the village
where they were going, and He indicated
that He would have gone farther.
29 But they constrained Him, saying,
"Abide with us, for it is toward evening,
and the day is far spent." And He went in
to stay with them.
30 Now it came to pass, as He sat at the
table with them, that He took bread,
blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.
31 Then their eyes were opened and
they knew Him; and He vanished from
their sight.
32 And they said to one another, "Did
not our heart burn within us while HeLUKE 24
185
talked with us on the road, and while He
opened the Scriptures to us?"
33 So they rose up that very hour and
returned to Jerusalem, and found the
eleven and those who were with them
gathered together,
34 saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and
has appeared to Simon!"
35 And they told about the things that
had happened on the road, and how He
was known to them in the breaking of
bread.
36 Now as they said these things, Jesus
Himself stood in the midst of them, and
said to them, "Peace to you."
37 But they were terriﬁed and
frightened, and supposed they had seen
a spirit.
38 And He said to them, "Why are you
troubled? And why do doubts arise in
your hearts?LUKE 24
186
39 "Behold My hands and My feet, that
it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a
spirit does not have ﬂesh and bones as
you see I have."
40 When He had said this, He showed
them His hands and His feet.
41 But while they s ll did not believe
for joy, and marveled, He said to them,
"Have you any food here?"
42 So they gave Him a piece of a broiled
ﬁsh and some honeycomb.
43 And He took it and ate in their
presence.
44 Then He said to them, "These are
the words which I spoke to you while I
was s ll with you, that all things must be
fulﬁlled which were wri en in the Law of
Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms
concerning Me."
45 And He opened their understanding,
that they might comprehend the
Scriptures.LUKE 24
187
46 Then He said to them, "Thus it is
wri en, and thus it was necessary for
the Christ to suﬀer and to rise from the
dead the third day,
47 "and that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached in His name
to all na ons, beginning at Jerusalem.
48 "And you are witnesses of these
things.
49 "Behold, I send the Promise of My
Father upon you; but tarry in the city
of Jerusalem un l you are endued with
power from on high."
50 And He led them out as far as
Bethany, and He li ed up His hands and
blessed them.
51 Now it came to pass, while He
blessed them, that He was parted from
them and carried up into heaven.
52 And they worshiped Him, and
returned to Jerusalem with great joy,LUKE 24
53 and were con
188
nually in the temple
praising and blessing God. Amen.John
1
1 In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.
2 He was in the beginning with God.
3 All things were made through Him,
and without Him nothing was made that
was made.
4 In Him was life, and the life was the
light of men.
5 And the light shines in the darkness,
and the darkness did not comprehend it.
6 There was a man sent from God,
whose name was John.
7 This man came for a witness, to bear
witness of the Light, that all through him
might believe.
8 He was not that Light, but was sent to
bear witness of that Light.JOHN 1
2
9 That was the true Light which gives
light to every man coming into the
world.
10 He was in the world, and the world
was made through Him, and the world
did not know Him.
11 He came to His own, and His own did
not receive Him.
12 But as many as received Him, to them
He gave the right to become children of
God, to those who believe in His name:
13 who were born, not of blood, nor of
the will of the ﬂesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God.
14 And the Word became ﬂesh and
dwelt among us, and we beheld His
glory, the glory as of the only bego en
of the Father, full of grace and truth.
15 John bore witness of Him and cried
out, saying, "This was He of whom I said,
‘He who comes a er me is preferred
before me, for He was before me.’"JOHN 1
3
16 And of His fullness we have all
received, and grace for grace.
17 For the law was given through Moses,
but grace and truth came through Jesus
Christ.
18 No one has seen God at any me.
The only bego en Son, who is in the
bosom of the Father, He has declared
Him.
19 Now this is the tes mony of John,
when the Jews sent priests and Levites
from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are
you?"
20 He confessed, and did not deny, but
confessed, "I am not the Christ."
21 And they asked him, "What then?
Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are
you the Prophet?" And he answered,
"No."
22 Then they said to him, "Who are you,
that we may give an answer to thoseJOHN 1
4
who sent us? What do you say about
yourself?"
23 He said: "I am ‘The voice of one
crying in the wilderness: "Make straight
the way of the LORD,"’ as the prophet
Isaiah said."
24 Now those who were sent were from
the Pharisees.
25 And they asked him, saying, "Why
then do you bap ze if you are not the
Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
26 John answered them, saying, "I
bap ze with water, but there stands One
among you whom you do not know.
27 "It is He who, coming a er me, is
preferred before me, whose sandal strap
I am not worthy to loose."
28 These things were done in Bethabara
beyond the Jordan, where John was
bap zing.
29 The next day John saw Jesus coming
toward him, and said, "Behold! TheJOHN 1
5
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
the world!
30 "This is He of whom I said, ‘A er me
comes a Man who is preferred before
me, for He was before me.’
31 "I did not know Him; but that He
should be revealed to Israel, therefore I
came bap zing with water."
32 And John bore witness, saying, "I saw
the Spirit descending from heaven like a
dove, and He remained upon Him.
33 "I did not know Him, but He who
sent me to bap ze with water said to
me, ‘Upon whom you see the Spirit
descending, and remaining on Him, this
is He who bap zes with the Holy Spirit.’
34 "And I have seen and tes ﬁed that
this is the Son of God."
35 Again, the next day, John stood with
two of his disciples.
36 And looking at Jesus as He walked,
he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!"JOHN 1
6
37 The two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus.
38 Then Jesus turned, and seeing them
following, said to them, "What do you
seek? " They said to Him, "Rabbi" (which
is to say, when translated, Teacher),
"where are You staying?"
39 He said to them, "Come and see."
They came and saw where He was
staying, and remained with Him that day
(now it was about the tenth hour).
40 One of the two who heard John
speak, and followed Him, was Andrew,
Simon Peter’s brother.
41 He ﬁrst found his own brother
Simon, and said to him, "We have found
the Messiah" (which is translated, the
Christ).
42 And he brought him to Jesus. Now
when Jesus looked at him, He said, "You
are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall beJOHN 1
7
called Cephas" (which is translated, A
Stone).
43 The following day Jesus wanted to go
to Galilee, and He found Philip and said
to him, "Follow Me."
44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the
city of Andrew and Peter.
45 Philip found Nathanael and said to
him, "We have found Him of whom
Moses in the law, and also the prophets,
wrote––Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
Joseph."
46 And Nathanael said to him, "Can
anything good come out of Nazareth?"
Philip said to him, "Come and see."
47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward
Him, and said of him, "Behold, an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
48 Nathanael said to Him, "How do You
know me?" Jesus answered and said to
him, "Before Philip called you, when you
were under the ﬁg tree, I saw you."JOHN 1 – 2
8
49 Nathanael answered and said to Him,
"Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are
the King of Israel!"
50 Jesus answered and said to him,
"Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under
the ﬁg tree,’ do you believe? You will see
greater things than these."
51 And He said to him, "Most assuredly,
I say to you, herea er you shall see
heaven open, and the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the Son
of Man."
1 On the third day there was a
wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the
mother of Jesus was there.
2 Now both Jesus and His disciples were
invited to the wedding.
3 And when they ran out of wine, the
mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have
no wine."
2JOHN 2
9
4 Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does
your concern have to do with Me? My
hour has not yet come."
5 His mother said to the servants,
"Whatever He says to you, do it."
6 Now there were set there six
waterpots of stone, according to the
manner of puriﬁca on of the Jews,
containing twenty or thirty gallons
apiece.
7 Jesus said to them, "Fill the waterpots
with water." And they ﬁlled them up to
the brim.
8 And He said to them, "Draw some out
now, and take it to the master of the
feast." And they took it.
9 When the master of the feast had
tasted the water that was made wine,
and did not know where it came from
(but the servants who had drawn the
water knew), the master of the feast
called the bridegroom.JOHN 2
10
10 And he said to him, "Every man at
the beginning sets out the good wine,
and when the guests have well drunk,
then the inferior. You have kept the good
wine un l now!"
11 This beginning of signs Jesus did in
Cana of Galilee, and manifested His
glory; and His disciples believed in Him.
12 A er this He went down to
Capernaum, He, His mother, His
brothers, and His disciples; and they did
not stay there many days.
13 Now the Passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
14 And He found in the temple those
who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
the moneychangers doing business.
15 When He had made a whip of cords,
He drove them all out of the temple,
with the sheep and the oxen, and poured
out the changers’ money and overturned
the tables.JOHN 2
11
16 And He said to those who sold
doves, "Take these things away! Do not
make My Father’s house a house of
merchandise!"
17 Then His disciples remembered that
it was wri en, "Zeal for Your house has
eaten Me up."
18 So the Jews answered and said to
Him, "What sign do You show to us, since
You do these things?"
19 Jesus answered and said to them,
"Destroy this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up."
20 Then the Jews said, "It has taken
forty–six years to build this temple, and
will You raise it up in three days?"
21 But He was speaking of the temple of
His body.
22 Therefore, when He had risen from
the dead, His disciples remembered
that He had said this to them; and theyJOHN 2 – 3
12
believed the Scripture and the word
which Jesus had said.
23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at
the Passover, during the feast, many
believed in His name when they saw the
signs which He did.
24 But Jesus did not commit Himself to
them, because He knew all men,
25 and had no need that anyone should
tes fy of man, for He knew what was in
man.
1 There was a man of the Pharisees
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews.
2 This man came to Jesus by night and
said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You
are a teacher come from God; for no one
can do these signs that You do unless
God is with him."
3 Jesus answered and said to him,
"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one
3JOHN 3
13
is born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God."
4 Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a
man be born when he is old? Can he
enter a second me into his mother’s
womb and be born?"
5 Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say
to you, unless one is born of water and
the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom
of God.
6 "That which is born of the ﬂesh is
ﬂesh, and that which is born of the Spirit
is spirit.
7 "Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You
must be born again.’
8 "The wind blows where it wishes, and
you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell
where it comes from and where it goes.
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him,
"How can these things be?"JOHN 3
14
10 Jesus answered and said to him, "Are
you the teacher of Israel, and do not
know these things?
11 "Most assuredly, I say to you, We
speak what We know and tes fy what
We have seen, and you do not receive
Our witness.
12 "If I have told you earthly things and
you do not believe, how will you believe
if I tell you heavenly things?
13 "No one has ascended to heaven but
He who came down from heaven, that
is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
14 "And as Moses li ed up the serpent
in the wilderness, even so must the Son
of Man be li ed up,
15 "that whoever believes in Him should
not perish but have eternal life.
16 "For God so loved the world that
He gave His only bego en Son, that
whoever believes in Him should not
perish but have everlas ng life.JOHN 3
15
17 "For God did not send His Son into
the world to condemn the world, but
that the world through Him might be
saved.
18 "He who believes in Him is not
condemned; but he who does not
believe is condemned already, because
he has not believed in the name of the
only bego en Son of God.
19 "And this is the condemna on, that
the light has come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light,
because their deeds were evil.
20 "For everyone prac cing evil hates
the light and does not come to the light,
lest his deeds should be exposed.
21 "But he who does the truth comes to
the light, that his deeds may be clearly
seen, that they have been done in God."
22 A er these things Jesus and His
disciples came into the land of Judea,JOHN 3
16
and there He remained with them and
bap zed.
23 Now John also was bap zing in
Aenon near Salim, because there was
much water there. And they came and
were bap zed.
24 For John had not yet been thrown
into prison.
25 Then there arose a dispute between
some of John’s disciples and the Jews
about puriﬁca on.
26 And they came to John and said
to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you
beyond the Jordan, to whom you have
tes ﬁed––behold, He is bap zing, and
all are coming to Him!"
27 John answered and said, "A man can
receive nothing unless it has been given
to him from heaven.
28 "You yourselves bear me witness,
that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I
have been sent before Him.’JOHN 3
17
29 "He who has the bride is the
bridegroom; but the friend of the
bridegroom, who stands and hears
him, rejoices greatly because of the
bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of
mine is fulﬁlled.
30 "He must increase, but I must
decrease.
31 "He who comes from above is above
all; he who is of the earth is earthly and
speaks of the earth. He who comes from
heaven is above all.
32 "And what He has seen and heard,
that He tes ﬁes; and no one receives His
tes mony.
33 "He who has received His tes mony
has cer ﬁed that God is true.
34 "For He whom God has sent speaks
the words of God, for God does not give
the Spirit by measure.
35 "The Father loves the Son, and has
given all things into His hand.JOHN 3 – 4
18
36 "He who believes in the Son has
everlas ng life; and he who does not
believe the Son shall not see life, but the
wrath of God abides on him."
1 Therefore, when the Lord knew
that the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus made and bap zed more disciples
than John
2 (though Jesus Himself did not bap ze,
but His disciples),
3 He le Judea and departed again to
Galilee.
4 But He needed to go through Samaria.
5 So He came to a city of Samaria which
is called Sychar, near the plot of ground
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
6 Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus
therefore, being wearied from His
journey, sat thus by the well. It was
about the sixth hour.
4JOHN 4
19
7 A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a
drink."
8 For His disciples had gone away into
the city to buy food.
9 Then the woman of Samaria said
to Him, "How is it that You, being a
Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan
woman?" For Jews have no dealings with
Samaritans.
10 Jesus answered and said to her, "If
you knew the gi of God, and who it is
who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you
would have asked Him, and He would
have given you living water."
11 The woman said to Him, "Sir, You
have nothing to draw with, and the well
is deep. Where then do You get that
living water?
12 "Are You greater than our father
Jacob, who gave us the well, and drankJOHN 4
20
from it himself, as well as his sons and
his livestock?"
13 Jesus answered and said to her,
"Whoever drinks of this water will thirst
again,
14 "but whoever drinks of the water
that I shall give him will never thirst.
But the water that I shall give him will
become in him a fountain of water
springing up into everlas ng life."
15 The woman said to Him, "Sir, give
me this water, that I may not thirst, nor
come here to draw."
16 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your
husband, and come here."
17 The woman answered and said, "I
have no husband." Jesus said to her,
"You have well said, ‘I have no husband,’
18 "for you have had ﬁve husbands, and
the one whom you now have is not your
husband; in that you spoke truly."JOHN 4
21
19 The woman said to Him, "Sir, I
perceive that You are a prophet.
20 "Our fathers worshiped on this
mountain, and you Jews say that in
Jerusalem is the place where one ought
to worship."
21 Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe
Me, the hour is coming when you
will neither on this mountain, nor in
Jerusalem, worship the Father.
22 "You worship what you do not know;
we know what we worship, for salva on
is of the Jews.
23 "But the hour is coming, and now is,
when the true worshipers will worship
the Father in spirit and truth; for the
Father is seeking such to worship Him.
24 "God is Spirit, and those who worship
Him must worship in spirit and truth."
25 The woman said to Him, "I know
that Messiah is coming" (who is calledJOHN 4
22
Christ). "When He comes, He will tell us
all things."
26 Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you
am He."
27 And at this point His disciples came,
and they marveled that He talked with
a woman; yet no one said, "What do
You seek?" or, "Why are You talking with
her?"
28 The woman then le her waterpot,
went her way into the city, and said to
the men,
29 "Come, see a Man who told me all
things that I ever did. Could this be the
Christ?"
30 Then they went out of the city and
came to Him.
31 In the mean me His disciples urged
Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
32 But He said to them, "I have food to
eat of which you do not know."JOHN 4
23
33 Therefore the disciples said to one
another, "Has anyone brought Him
anything to eat?"
34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to
do the will of Him who sent Me, and to
ﬁnish His work.
35 "Do you not say, ‘There are s ll four
months and then comes the harvest’?
Behold, I say to you, li up your eyes and
look at the ﬁelds, for they are already
white for harvest!
36 "And he who reaps receives wages,
and gathers fruit for eternal life, that
both he who sows and he who reaps
may rejoice together.
37 "For in this the saying is true: ‘One
sows and another reaps.’
38 "I sent you to reap that for which you
have not labored; others have labored,
and you have entered into their labors."
39 And many of the Samaritans of that
city believed in Him because of the wordJOHN 4
24
of the woman who tes ﬁed, "He told me
all that I ever did."
40 So when the Samaritans had come to
Him, they urged Him to stay with them;
and He stayed there two days.
41 And many more believed because of
His own word.
42 Then they said to the woman, "Now
we believe, not because of what you
said, for we ourselves have heard Him
and we know that this is indeed the
Christ, the Savior of the world."
43 Now a er the two days He departed
from there and went to Galilee.
44 For Jesus Himself tes ﬁed that a
prophet has no honor in his own country.
45 So when He came to Galilee, the
Galileans received Him, having seen all
the things He did in Jerusalem at the
feast; for they also had gone to the feast.
46 So Jesus came again to Cana of
Galilee where He had made the waterJOHN 4
25
wine. And there was a certain nobleman
whose son was sick at Capernaum.
47 When he heard that Jesus had come
out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him
and implored Him to come down and
heal his son, for he was at the point of
death.
48 Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you
people see signs and wonders, you will
by no means believe."
49 The nobleman said to Him, "Sir, come
down before my child dies!"
50 Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your
son lives." So the man believed the word
that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his
way.
51 And as he was now going down, his
servants met him and told him, saying,
"Your son lives!"
52 Then he inquired of them the hour
when he got be er. And they said toJOHN 4 – 5
26
him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the
fever le him."
53 So the father knew that it was at
the same hour in which Jesus said to
him, "Your son lives." And he himself
believed, and his whole household.
54 This again is the second sign Jesus
did when He had come out of Judea into
Galilee.
1 A er this there was a feast of
the Jews, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the
Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in
Hebrew, Bethesda, having ﬁve porches.
3 In these lay a great mul tude of sick
people, blind, lame, paralyzed, wai ng
for the moving of the water.
4 For an angel went down at a certain
me into the pool and s rred up the
water; then whoever stepped in ﬁrst,
5JOHN 5
27
a er the s rring of the water, was made
well of whatever disease he had.
5 Now a certain man was there who
had an inﬁrmity thirty–eight years.
6 When Jesus saw him lying there, and
knew that he already had been in that
condi on a long me, He said to him,
"Do you want to be made well?"
7 The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I
have no man to put me into the pool
when the water is s rred up; but while I
am coming, another steps down before
me."
8 Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your
bed and walk."
9 And immediately the man was made
well, took up his bed, and walked. And
that day was the Sabbath.
10 The Jews therefore said to him who
was cured, "It is the Sabbath; it is not
lawful for you to carry your bed."JOHN 5
28
11 He answered them, "He who made
me well said to me, ‘Take up your bed
and walk.’"
12 Then they asked him, "Who is the
Man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed
and walk’?"
13 But the one who was healed did
not know who it was, for Jesus had
withdrawn, a mul tude being in that
place.
14 A erward Jesus found him in the
temple, and said to him, "See, you have
been made well. Sin no more, lest a
worse thing come upon you."
15 The man departed and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had made him
well.
16 For this reason the Jews persecuted
Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He
had done these things on the Sabbath.JOHN 5
29
17 But Jesus answered them, "My
Father has been working un l now, and I
have been working."
18 Therefore the Jews sought all the
more to kill Him, because He not only
broke the Sabbath, but also said that
God was His Father, making Himself
equal with God.
19 Then Jesus answered and said to
them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, the
Son can do nothing of Himself, but what
He sees the Father do; for whatever He
does, the Son also does in like manner.
20 "For the Father loves the Son, and
shows Him all things that He Himself
does; and He will show Him greater
works than these, that you may marvel.
21 "For as the Father raises the dead
and gives life to them, even so the Son
gives life to whom He will.
22 "For the Father judges no one, but
has commi ed all judgment to the Son,JOHN 5
30
23 "that all should honor the Son just
as they honor the Father. He who does
not honor the Son does not honor the
Father who sent Him.
24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who
hears My word and believes in Him who
sent Me has everlas ng life, and shall
not come into judgment, but has passed
from death into life.
25 "Most assuredly, I say to you, the
hour is coming, and now is, when the
dead will hear the voice of the Son of
God; and those who hear will live.
26 "For as the Father has life in Himself,
so He has granted the Son to have life in
Himself,
27 "and has given Him authority to
execute judgment also, because He is
the Son of Man.
28 "Do not marvel at this; for the hour is
coming in which all who are in the graves
will hear His voiceJOHN 5
31
29 "and come forth––those who have
done good, to the resurrec on of life,
and those who have done evil, to the
resurrec on of condemna on.
30 "I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear,
I judge; and My judgment is righteous,
because I do not seek My own will but
the will of the Father who sent Me.
31 "If I bear witness of Myself, My
witness is not true.
32 "There is another who bears witness
of Me, and I know that the witness
which He witnesses of Me is true.
33 "You have sent to John, and he has
borne witness to the truth.
34 "Yet I do not receive tes mony from
man, but I say these things that you may
be saved.
35 "He was the burning and shining
lamp, and you were willing for a me to
rejoice in his light.JOHN 5
32
36 "But I have a greater witness than
John’s; for the works which the Father
has given Me to ﬁnish––the very works
that I do––bear witness of Me, that the
Father has sent Me.
37 "And the Father Himself, who sent
Me, has tes ﬁed of Me. You have neither
heard His voice at any me, nor seen His
form.
38 "But you do not have His word
abiding in you, because whom He sent,
Him you do not believe.
39 "You search the Scriptures, for in
them you think you have eternal life;
and these are they which tes fy of Me.
40 "But you are not willing to come to
Me that you may have life.
41 "I do not receive honor from men.
42 "But I know you, that you do not
have the love of God in you.
43 "I have come in My Father’s name,
and you do not receive Me; if anotherJOHN 5 – 6
33
comes in his own name, him you will
receive.
44 "How can you believe, who receive
honor from one another, and do not
seek the honor that comes from the only
God?
45 "Do not think that I shall accuse you
to the Father; there is one who accuses
you––Moses, in whom you trust.
46 "For if you believed Moses, you
would believe Me; for he wrote about
Me.
47 "But if you do not believe his wri ngs,
how will you believe My words?"
1 A er these things Jesus went over
the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea
of Tiberias.
2 Then a great mul tude followed Him,
because they saw His signs which He
performed on those who were diseased.
3 And Jesus went up on the mountain,
and there He sat with His disciples.
6JOHN 6
34
4 Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews,
was near.
5 Then Jesus li ed up His eyes, and
seeing a great mul tude coming toward
Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we
buy bread, that these may eat?"
6 But this He said to test him, for He
Himself knew what He would do.
7 Philip answered Him, "Two hundred
denarii worth of bread is not suﬃcient
for them, that every one of them may
have a li le."
8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon
Peter’s brother, said to Him,
9 "There is a lad here who has ﬁve
barley loaves and two small ﬁsh, but
what are they among so many?"
10 Then Jesus said, "Make the people sit
down." Now there was much grass in the
place. So the men sat down, in number
about ﬁve thousand.JOHN 6
35
11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when
He had given thanks He distributed them
to the disciples, and the disciples to
those si ng down; and likewise of the
ﬁsh, as much as they wanted.
12 So when they were ﬁlled, He said to
His disciples, "Gather up the fragments
that remain, so that nothing is lost."
13 Therefore they gathered them up,
and ﬁlled twelve baskets with the
fragments of the ﬁve barley loaves which
were le over by those who had eaten.
14 Then those men, when they had
seen the sign that Jesus did, said, "This
is truly the Prophet who is to come into
the world."
15 Therefore when Jesus perceived that
they were about to come and take Him
by force to make Him king, He departed
again to the mountain by Himself alone.
16 Now when evening came, His
disciples went down to the sea,JOHN 6
36
17 got into the boat, and went over
the sea toward Capernaum. And it was
already dark, and Jesus had not come to
them.
18 Then the sea arose because a great
wind was blowing.
19 So when they had rowed about three
or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on
the sea and drawing near the boat; and
they were afraid.
20 But He said to them, "It is I; do not be
afraid."
21 Then they willingly received Him into
the boat, and immediately the boat was
at the land where they were going.
22 On the following day, when the
people who were standing on the other
side of the sea saw that there was no
other boat there, except that one which
His disciples had entered, and that
Jesus had not entered the boat withJOHN 6
37
His disciples, but His disciples had gone
away alone––
23 however, other boats came from
Tiberias, near the place where they ate
bread a er the Lord had given thanks––
24 when the people therefore saw that
Jesus was not there, nor His disciples,
they also got into boats and came to
Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
25 And when they found Him on the
other side of the sea, they said to Him,
"Rabbi, when did You come here?"
26 Jesus answered them and said, "Most
assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not
because you saw the signs, but because
you ate of the loaves and were ﬁlled.
27 "Do not labor for the food which
perishes, but for the food which endures
to everlas ng life, which the Son of Man
will give you, because God the Father
has set His seal on Him."JOHN 6
38
28 Then they said to Him, "What shall
we do, that we may work the works of
God?"
29 Jesus answered and said to them,
"This is the work of God, that you believe
in Him whom He sent."
30 Therefore they said to Him, "What
sign will You perform then, that we may
see it and believe You? What work will
You do?
31 "Our fathers ate the manna in the
desert; as it is wri en, ‘He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.’"
32 Then Jesus said to them, "Most
assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not
give you the bread from heaven, but My
Father gives you the true bread from
heaven.
33 "For the bread of God is He who
comes down from heaven and gives life
to the world."JOHN 6
39
34 Then they said to Him, "Lord, give us
this bread always."
35 And Jesus said to them, "I am the
bread of life. He who comes to Me shall
never hunger, and he who believes in
Me shall never thirst.
36 "But I said to you that you have seen
Me and yet do not believe.
37 "All that the Father gives Me will
come to Me, and the one who comes to
Me I will by no means cast out.
38 "For I have come down from heaven,
not to do My own will, but the will of
Him who sent Me.
39 "This is the will of the Father who
sent Me, that of all He has given Me I
should lose nothing, but should raise it
up at the last day.
40 "And this is the will of Him who sent
Me, that everyone who sees the Son and
believes in Him may have everlas ng life;
and I will raise him up at the last day."JOHN 6
40
41 The Jews then complained about
Him, because He said, "I am the bread
which came down from heaven."
42 And they said, "Is not this Jesus, the
son of Joseph, whose father and mother
we know? How is it then that He says, ‘I
have come down from heaven’?"
43 Jesus therefore answered and said
to them, "Do not murmur among
yourselves.
44 "No one can come to Me unless the
Father who sent Me draws him; and I
will raise him up at the last day.
45 "It is wri en in the prophets,
‘And they shall all be taught by God.’
Therefore everyone who has heard and
learned from the Father comes to Me.
46 "Not that anyone has seen the Father,
except He who is from God; He has seen
the Father.
47 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who
believes in Me has everlas ng life.JOHN 6
41
48 "I am the bread of life.
49 "Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and are dead.
50 "This is the bread which comes down
from heaven, that one may eat of it and
not die.
51 "I am the living bread which came
down from heaven. If anyone eats of this
bread, he will live forever; and the bread
that I shall give is My ﬂesh, which I shall
give for the life of the world."
52 The Jews therefore quarreled among
themselves, saying, "How can this Man
give us His ﬂesh to eat?"
53 Then Jesus said to them, "Most
assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat
the ﬂesh of the Son of Man and drink His
blood, you have no life in you.
54 "Whoever eats My ﬂesh and drinks
My blood has eternal life, and I will raise
him up at the last day.JOHN 6
42
55 "For My ﬂesh is food indeed, and My
blood is drink indeed.
56 "He who eats My ﬂesh and drinks My
blood abides in Me, and I in him.
57 "As the living Father sent Me, and
I live because of the Father, so he who
feeds on Me will live because of Me.
58 "This is the bread which came down
from heaven––not as your fathers ate
the manna, and are dead. He who eats
this bread will live forever."
59 These things He said in the synagogue
as He taught in Capernaum.
60 Therefore many of His disciples,
when they heard this, said, "This is a
hard saying; who can understand it?"
61 When Jesus knew in Himself that His
disciples complained about this, He said
to them, "Does this oﬀend you?
62 "What then if you should see the Son
of Man ascend where He was before?JOHN 6
43
63 "It is the Spirit who gives life; the
ﬂesh proﬁts nothing. The words that I
speak to you are spirit, and they are life.
64 "But there are some of you who do
not believe." For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who did not
believe, and who would betray Him.
65 And He said, "Therefore I have said
to you that no one can come to Me
unless it has been granted to him by My
Father."
66 From that me many of His disciples
went back and walked with Him no
more.
67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, "Do
you also want to go away?"
68 But Simon Peter answered Him,
"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have
the words of eternal life.
69 "Also we have come to believe and
know that You are the Christ, the Son of
the living God."JOHN 6 – 7
44
70 Jesus answered them, "Did I not
choose you, the twelve, and one of you
is a devil?"
71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of
Simon, for it was he who would betray
Him, being one of the twelve.
1 A er these things Jesus walked in
Galilee; for He did not want to walk
in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill
Him.
2 Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles
was at hand.
3 His brothers therefore said to Him,
"Depart from here and go into Judea,
that Your disciples also may see the
works that You are doing.
4 "For no one does anything in secret
while he himself seeks to be known
openly. If You do these things, show
Yourself to the world."
5 For even His brothers did not believe
in Him.
7JOHN 7
6 Then Jesus said to them, "My
45
me has
not yet come, but your me is always
ready.
7 "The world cannot hate you, but it
hates Me because I tes fy of it that its
works are evil.
8 "You go up to this feast. I am not yet
going up to this feast, for My me has
not yet fully come."
9 When He had said these things to
them, He remained in Galilee.
10 But when His brothers had gone up,
then He also went up to the feast, not
openly, but as it were in secret.
11 Then the Jews sought Him at the
feast, and said, "Where is He?"
12 And there was much complaining
among the people concerning Him.
Some said, "He is good"; others said,
"No, on the contrary, He deceives the
people."JOHN 7
46
13 However, no one spoke openly of
Him for fear of the Jews.
14 Now about the middle of the feast
Jesus went up into the temple and
taught.
15 And the Jews marveled, saying, "How
does this Man know le ers, having never
studied?"
16 Jesus answered them and said, "My
doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent
Me.
17 "If anyone wants to do His will, he
shall know concerning the doctrine,
whether it is from God or whether I
speak on My own authority.
18 "He who speaks from himself seeks
his own glory; but He who seeks the
glory of the One who sent Him is true,
and no unrighteousness is in Him.
19 "Did not Moses give you the law, yet
none of you keeps the law? Why do you
seek to kill Me?"JOHN 7
47
20 The people answered and said, "You
have a demon. Who is seeking to kill
You?"
21 Jesus answered and said to them, "I
did one work, and you all marvel.
22 "Moses therefore gave you
circumcision (not that it is from Moses,
but from the fathers), and you circumcise
a man on the Sabbath.
23 "If a man receives circumcision on
the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses
should not be broken, are you angry with
Me because I made a man completely
well on the Sabbath?
24 "Do not judge according to
appearance, but judge with righteous
judgment."
25 Now some of them from Jerusalem
said, "Is this not He whom they seek to
kill?JOHN 7
48
26 "But look! He speaks boldly, and they
say nothing to Him. Do the rulers know
indeed that this is truly the Christ?
27 "However, we know where this Man
is from; but when the Christ comes, no
one knows where He is from."
28 Then Jesus cried out, as He taught
in the temple, saying, "You both know
Me, and you know where I am from; and
I have not come of Myself, but He who
sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
29 "But I know Him, for I am from Him,
and He sent Me."
30 Therefore they sought to take Him;
but no one laid a hand on Him, because
His hour had not yet come.
31 And many of the people believed in
Him, and said, "When the Christ comes,
will He do more signs than these which
this Man has done?"
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd
murmuring these things concerning Him,JOHN 7
49
and the Pharisees and the chief priests
sent oﬃcers to take Him.
33 Then Jesus said to them, "I shall be
with you a li le while longer, and then I
go to Him who sent Me.
34 "You will seek Me and not ﬁnd Me,
and where I am you cannot come."
35 Then the Jews said among
themselves, "Where does He intend to
go that we shall not ﬁnd Him? Does He
intend to go to the Dispersion among
the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
36 "What is this thing that He said, ‘You
will seek Me and not ﬁnd Me, and where
I am you cannot come’?"
37 On the last day, that great day of the
feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying,
"If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me
and drink.
38 "He who believes in Me, as the
Scripture has said, out of his heart will
ﬂow rivers of living water."JOHN 7
50
39 But this He spoke concerning the
Spirit, whom those believing in Him
would receive; for the Holy Spirit was
not yet given, because Jesus was not yet
gloriﬁed.
40 Therefore many from the crowd,
when they heard this saying, said, "Truly
this is the Prophet."
41 Others said, "This is the Christ." But
some said, "Will the Christ come out of
Galilee?
42 "Has not the Scripture said that the
Christ comes from the seed of David
and from the town of Bethlehem, where
David was?"
43 So there was a division among the
people because of Him.
44 Now some of them wanted to take
Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
45 Then the oﬃcers came to the chief
priests and Pharisees, who said to them,
"Why have you not brought Him?"JOHN 7 – 8
51
46 The oﬃcers answered, "No man ever
spoke like this Man!"
47 Then the Pharisees answered them,
"Are you also deceived?
48 "Have any of the rulers or the
Pharisees believed in Him?
49 "But this crowd that does not know
the law is accursed."
50 Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by
night, being one of them) said to them,
51 "Does our law judge a man before it
hears him and knows what he is doing?"
52 They answered and said to him, "Are
you also from Galilee? Search and look,
for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."
53 And everyone went to his own house.
1 But Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives.
2 Now early in the morning He came
again into the temple, and all the people
came to Him; and He sat down and
taught them.
8JOHN 8
52
3 Then the scribes and Pharisees
brought to Him a woman caught in
adultery. And when they had set her in
the midst,
4 they said to Him, "Teacher, this
woman was caught in adultery, in the
very act.
5 "Now Moses, in the law, commanded
us that such should be stoned. But what
do You say?"
6 This they said, tes ng Him, that they
might have something of which to
accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down
and wrote on the ground with His ﬁnger,
as though He did not hear.
7 So when they con nued asking Him,
He raised Himself up and said to them,
"He who is without sin among you, let
him throw a stone at her ﬁrst."
8 And again He stooped down and
wrote on the ground.JOHN 8
53
9 Then those who heard it, being
convicted by their conscience, went out
one by one, beginning with the oldest
even to the last. And Jesus was le
alone, and the woman standing in the
midst.
10 When Jesus had raised Himself
up and saw no one but the woman,
He said to her, "Woman, where are
those accusers of yours? Has no one
condemned you?"
11 She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus
said to her, "Neither do I condemn you;
go and sin no more."
12 Then Jesus spoke to them again,
saying, "I am the light of the world.
He who follows Me shall not walk in
darkness, but have the light of life."
13 The Pharisees therefore said to Him,
"You bear witness of Yourself; Your
witness is not true."JOHN 8
54
14 Jesus answered and said to them,
"Even if I bear witness of Myself, My
witness is true, for I know where I came
from and where I am going; but you do
not know where I come from and where
I am going.
15 "You judge according to the ﬂesh; I
judge no one.
16 "And yet if I do judge, My judgment
is true; for I am not alone, but I am with
the Father who sent Me.
17 "It is also wri en in your law that the
tes mony of two men is true.
18 "I am One who bears witness of
Myself, and the Father who sent Me
bears witness of Me."
19 Then they said to Him, "Where is
Your Father?" Jesus answered, "You
know neither Me nor My Father. If you
had known Me, you would have known
My Father also."JOHN 8
55
20 These words Jesus spoke in the
treasury, as He taught in the temple; and
no one laid hands on Him, for His hour
had not yet come.
21 Then Jesus said to them again, "I
am going away, and you will seek Me,
and will die in your sin. Where I go you
cannot come."
22 So the Jews said, "Will He kill Himself,
because He says, ‘Where I go you cannot
come’?"
23 And He said to them, "You are from
beneath; I am from above. You are of
this world; I am not of this world.
24 "Therefore I said to you that you will
die in your sins; for if you do not believe
that I am He, you will die in your sins."
25 Then they said to Him, "Who are
You?" And Jesus said to them, "Just
what I have been saying to you from the
beginning.JOHN 8
56
26 "I have many things to say and to
judge concerning you, but He who sent
Me is true; and I speak to the world
those things which I heard from Him."
27 They did not understand that He
spoke to them of the Father.
28 Then Jesus said to them, "When you
li up the Son of Man, then you will
know that I am He, and that I do nothing
of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I
speak these things.
29 "And He who sent Me is with Me.
The Father has not le Me alone, for I
always do those things that please Him."
30 As He spoke these words, many
believed in Him.
31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who
believed Him, "If you abide in My word,
you are My disciples indeed.
32 "And you shall know the truth, and
the truth shall make you free."JOHN 8
57
33 They answered Him, "We are
Abraham’s descendants, and have never
been in bondage to anyone. How can
you say, ‘You will be made free’?"
34 Jesus answered them, "Most
assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits
sin is a slave of sin.
35 "And a slave does not abide in the
house forever, but a son abides forever.
36 "Therefore if the Son makes you free,
you shall be free indeed.
37 "I know that you are Abraham’s
descendants, but you seek to kill Me,
because My word has no place in you.
38 "I speak what I have seen with My
Father, and you do what you have seen
with your father."
39 They answered and said to Him,
"Abraham is our father." Jesus said to
them, "If you were Abraham’s children,
you would do the works of Abraham.JOHN 8
58
40 "But now you seek to kill Me, a Man
who has told you the truth which I heard
from God. Abraham did not do this.
41 "You do the deeds of your father."
Then they said to Him, "We were
not born of fornica on; we have one
Father––God."
42 Jesus said to them, "If God were
your Father, you would love Me, for I
proceeded forth and came from God;
nor have I come of Myself, but He sent
Me.
43 "Why do you not understand My
speech? Because you are not able to
listen to My word.
44 "You are of your father the devil,
and the desires of your father you want
to do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and does not stand in the
truth, because there is no truth in him.
When he speaks a lie, he speaks from hisJOHN 8
59
own resources, for he is a liar and the
father of it.
45 "But because I tell the truth, you do
not believe Me.
46 "Which of you convicts Me of sin?
And if I tell the truth, why do you not
believe Me?
47 "He who is of God hears God’s words;
therefore you do not hear, because you
are not of God."
48 Then the Jews answered and said to
Him, "Do we not say rightly that You are
a Samaritan and have a demon?"
49 Jesus answered, "I do not have a
demon; but I honor My Father, and you
dishonor Me.
50 "And I do not seek My own glory;
there is One who seeks and judges.
51 "Most assuredly, I say to you, if
anyone keeps My word he shall never
see death."JOHN 8
60
52 Then the Jews said to Him, "Now we
know that You have a demon! Abraham
is dead, and the prophets; and You say,
‘If anyone keeps My word he shall never
taste death.’
53 "Are You greater than our father
Abraham, who is dead? And the
prophets are dead. Whom do You make
Yourself out to be?"
54 Jesus answered, "If I honor Myself,
My honor is nothing. It is My Father who
honors Me, of whom you say that He is
your God.
55 "Yet you have not known Him, but I
know Him. And if I say, ‘I do not know
Him,’ I shall be a liar like you; but I do
know Him and keep His word.
56 "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
My day, and he saw it and was glad."
57 Then the Jews said to Him, "You are
not yet ﬁ y years old, and have You seen
Abraham?"JOHN 8 – 9
61
58 Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I
say to you, before Abraham was, I AM."
59 Then they took up stones to throw at
Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out
of the temple, going through the midst
of them, and so passed by.
1 Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a
man who was blind from birth.
2 And His disciples asked Him, saying,
"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his
parents, that he was born blind?"
3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor
his parents sinned, but that the works of
God should be revealed in him.
4 "I must work the works of Him who
sent Me while it is day; the night is
coming when no one can work.
5 "As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world."
6 When He had said these things, He
spat on the ground and made clay with
9JOHN 9
62
the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of
the blind man with the clay.
7 And He said to him, "Go, wash in the
pool of Siloam" (which is translated,
Sent). So he went and washed, and came
back seeing.
8 Therefore the neighbors and those
who previously had seen that he was
blind said, "Is not this he who sat and
begged?"
9 Some said, "This is he. " Others said,
"He is like him." He said, "I am he."
10 Therefore they said to him, "How
were your eyes opened?"
11 He answered and said, "A Man called
Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes
and said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam
and wash.’ So I went and washed, and I
received sight."
12 Then they said to him, "Where is
He?" He said, "I do not know."JOHN 9
63
13 They brought him who formerly was
blind to the Pharisees.
14 Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus
made the clay and opened his eyes.
15 Then the Pharisees also asked him
again how he had received his sight. He
said to them, "He put clay on my eyes,
and I washed, and I see."
16 Therefore some of the Pharisees
said, "This Man is not from God, because
He does not keep the Sabbath." Others
said, "How can a man who is a sinner do
such signs?" And there was a division
among them.
17 They said to the blind man again,
"What do you say about Him because
He opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a
prophet."
18 But the Jews did not believe
concerning him, that he had been blind
and received his sight, un l they calledJOHN 9
64
the parents of him who had received his
sight.
19 And they asked them, saying, "Is this
your son, who you say was born blind?
How then does he now see?"
20 His parents answered them and said,
"We know that this is our son, and that
he was born blind;
21 "but by what means he now sees we
do not know, or who opened his eyes we
do not know. He is of age; ask him. He
will speak for himself."
22 His parents said these things because
they feared the Jews, for the Jews had
agreed already that if anyone confessed
that He was Christ, he would be put out
of the synagogue.
23 Therefore his parents said, "He is of
age; ask him."
24 So they again called the man who
was blind, and said to him, "Give GodJOHN 9
65
the glory! We know that this Man is a
sinner."
25 He answered and said, "Whether He
is a sinner or not I do not know. One
thing I know: that though I was blind,
now I see."
26 Then they said to him again, "What
did He do to you? How did He open your
eyes?"
27 He answered them, "I told you
already, and you did not listen. Why do
you want to hear it again? Do you also
want to become His disciples?"
28 Then they reviled him and said,
"You are His disciple, but we are Moses’
disciples.
29 "We know that God spoke to Moses;
as for this fellow, we do not know where
He is from."
30 The man answered and said to them,
"Why, this is a marvelous thing, that youJOHN 9
66
do not know where He is from; yet He
has opened my eyes!
31 "Now we know that God does not
hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper
of God and does His will, He hears him.
32 "Since the world began it has been
unheard of that anyone opened the eyes
of one who was born blind.
33 "If this Man were not from God, He
could do nothing."
34 They answered and said to him, "You
were completely born in sins, and are
you teaching us?" And they cast him out.
35 Jesus heard that they had cast him
out; and when He had found him, He
said to him, "Do you believe in the Son
of God?"
36 He answered and said, "Who is He,
Lord, that I may believe in Him?"
37 And Jesus said to him, "You have
both seen Him and it is He who is talking
with you."JOHN 9 – 10
67
38 Then he said, "Lord, I believe!" And
he worshiped Him.
39 And Jesus said, "For judgment I have
come into this world, that those who do
not see may see, and that those who see
may be made blind."
40 Then some of the Pharisees who
were with Him heard these words, and
said to Him, "Are we blind also?"
41 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind,
you would have no sin; but now you say,
‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.
1 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he
who does not enter the sheepfold
by the door, but climbs up some other
way, the same is a thief and a robber.
2 "But he who enters by the door is the
shepherd of the sheep.
3 "To him the doorkeeper opens, and
the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his
own sheep by name and leads them out.
10JOHN 10
68
4 "And when he brings out his own
sheep, he goes before them; and the
sheep follow him, for they know his
voice.
5 "Yet they will by no means follow a
stranger, but will ﬂee from him, for they
do not know the voice of strangers."
6 Jesus used this illustra on, but they
did not understand the things which He
spoke to them.
7 Then Jesus said to them again, "Most
assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of
the sheep.
8 "All who ever came before Me are
thieves and robbers, but the sheep did
not hear them.
9 "I am the door. If anyone enters by
Me, he will be saved, and will go in and
out and ﬁnd pasture.
10 "The thief does not come except to
steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I haveJOHN 10
69
come that they may have life, and that
they may have it more abundantly.
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd gives His life for the sheep.
12 "But a hireling, he who is not the
shepherd, one who does not own
the sheep, sees the wolf coming and
leaves the sheep and ﬂees; and the wolf
catches the sheep and sca ers them.
13 "The hireling ﬂees because he is a
hireling and does not care about the
sheep.
14 "I am the good shepherd; and I know
My sheep, and am known by My own.
15 "As the Father knows Me, even so I
know the Father; and I lay down My life
for the sheep.
16 "And other sheep I have which are
not of this fold; them also I must bring,
and they will hear My voice; and there
will be one ﬂock and one shepherd.JOHN 10
70
17 "Therefore My Father loves Me,
because I lay down My life that I may
take it again.
18 "No one takes it from Me, but I lay
it down of Myself. I have power to lay it
down, and I have power to take it again.
This command I have received from My
Father."
19 Therefore there was a division again
among the Jews because of these
sayings.
20 And many of them said, "He has a
demon and is mad. Why do you listen to
Him?"
21 Others said, "These are not the words
of one who has a demon. Can a demon
open the eyes of the blind?"
22 Now it was the Feast of Dedica on in
Jerusalem, and it was winter.
23 And Jesus walked in the temple, in
Solomon’s porch.JOHN 10
71
24 Then the Jews surrounded Him and
said to Him, "How long do You keep us
in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us
plainly."
25 Jesus answered them, "I told you,
and you do not believe. The works that
I do in My Father’s name, they bear
witness of Me.
26 "But you do not believe, because you
are not of My sheep, as I said to you.
27 "My sheep hear My voice, and I know
them, and they follow Me.
28 "And I give them eternal life, and
they shall never perish; neither shall
anyone snatch them out of My hand.
29 "My Father, who has given them to
Me, is greater than all; and no one is
able to snatch them out of My Father’s
hand.
30 "I and My Father are one."
31 Then the Jews took up stones again
to stone Him.JOHN 10
72
32 Jesus answered them, "Many good
works I have shown you from My Father.
For which of those works do you stone
Me?"
33 The Jews answered Him, saying, "For
a good work we do not stone You, but
for blasphemy, and because You, being a
Man, make Yourself God."
34 Jesus answered them, "Is it not
wri en in your law, ‘I said, "You are
gods"’?
35 "If He called them gods, to whom the
word of God came (and the Scripture
cannot be broken),
36 "do you say of Him whom the Father
sanc ﬁed and sent into the world, ‘You
are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am
the Son of God’?
37 "If I do not do the works of My Father,
do not believe Me;
38 "but if I do, though you do not
believe Me, believe the works, that youJOHN 10 – 11
73
may know and believe that the Father is
in Me, and I in Him."
39 Therefore they sought again to seize
Him, but He escaped out of their hand.
40 And He went away again beyond
the Jordan to the place where John was
bap zing at ﬁrst, and there He stayed.
41 Then many came to Him and said,
"John performed no sign, but all the
things that John spoke about this Man
were true."
42 And many believed in Him there.
1 Now a certain man was sick,
Lazarus of Bethany, the town of
Mary and her sister Martha.
2 It was that Mary who anointed the
Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet
with her hair, whose brother Lazarus
was sick.
3 Therefore the sisters sent to Him,
saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love
is sick."
11JOHN 11
74
4 When Jesus heard that, He said, "This
sickness is not unto death, but for the
glory of God, that the Son of God may be
gloriﬁed through it."
5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister
and Lazarus.
6 So, when He heard that he was sick,
He stayed two more days in the place
where He was.
7 Then a er this He said to the disciples,
"Let us go to Judea again."
8 The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi,
lately the Jews sought to stone You, and
are You going there again?"
9 Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve
hours in the day? If anyone walks in the
day, he does not stumble, because he
sees the light of this world.
10 "But if one walks in the night, he
stumbles, because the light is not in
him."JOHN 11
11 These things He said, and a
75
er that
He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus
sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up."
12 Then His disciples said, "Lord, if he
sleeps he will get well."
13 However, Jesus spoke of his death,
but they thought that He was speaking
about taking rest in sleep.
14 Then Jesus said to them plainly,
"Lazarus is dead.
15 "And I am glad for your sakes that
I was not there, that you may believe.
Nevertheless let us go to him."
16 Then Thomas, who is called the Twin,
said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also
go, that we may die with Him."
17 So when Jesus came, He found that
he had already been in the tomb four
days.
18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem,
about two miles away.JOHN 11
76
19 And many of the Jews had joined the
women around Martha and Mary, to
comfort them concerning their brother.
20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard
that Jesus was coming, went and met
Him, but Mary was si ng in the house.
21 Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if
You had been here, my brother would
not have died.
22 "But even now I know that whatever
You ask of God, God will give You."
23 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will
rise again."
24 Martha said to Him, "I know that he
will rise again in the resurrec on at the
last day."
25 Jesus said to her, "I am the
resurrec on and the life. He who
believes in Me, though he may die, he
shall live.
26 "And whoever lives and believes in
Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"JOHN 11
77
27 She said to Him, "Yes, Lord, I believe
that You are the Christ, the Son of God,
who is to come into the world."
28 And when she had said these things,
she went her way and secretly called
Mary her sister, saying, "The Teacher has
come and is calling for you."
29 As soon as she heard that, she arose
quickly and came to Him.
30 Now Jesus had not yet come into
the town, but was in the place where
Martha met Him.
31 Then the Jews who were with her in
the house, and comfor ng her, when
they saw that Mary rose up quickly and
went out, followed her, saying, "She is
going to the tomb to weep there."
32 Then, when Mary came where Jesus
was, and saw Him, she fell down at His
feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had
been here, my brother would not have
died."JOHN 11
78
33 Therefore, when Jesus saw her
weeping, and the Jews who came with
her weeping, He groaned in the spirit
and was troubled.
34 And He said, "Where have you laid
him?" They said to Him, "Lord, come and
see."
35 Jesus wept.
36 Then the Jews said, "See how He
loved him!"
37 And some of them said, "Could not
this Man, who opened the eyes of the
blind, also have kept this man from
dying?"
38 Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself,
came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a
stone lay against it.
39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone."
Martha, the sister of him who was dead,
said to Him, "Lord, by this me there is a
stench, for he has been dead four days."JOHN 11
79
40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you
that if you would believe you would see
the glory of God?"
41 Then they took away the stone from
the place where the dead man was lying.
And Jesus li ed up His eyes and said,
"Father, I thank You that You have heard
Me.
42 "And I know that You always hear
Me, but because of the people who are
standing by I said this, that they may
believe that You sent Me."
43 Now when He had said these things,
He cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus,
come forth!"
44 And he who had died came out
bound hand and foot with graveclothes,
and his face was wrapped with a cloth.
Jesus said to them, "Loose him, and let
him go."JOHN 11
80
45 Then many of the Jews who had
come to Mary, and had seen the things
Jesus did, believed in Him.
46 But some of them went away to the
Pharisees and told them the things Jesus
did.
47 Then the chief priests and the
Pharisees gathered a council and said,
"What shall we do? For this Man works
many signs.
48 "If we let Him alone like this,
everyone will believe in Him, and the
Romans will come and take away both
our place and na on."
49 And one of them, Caiaphas, being
high priest that year, said to them, "You
know nothing at all,
50 "nor do you consider that it is
expedient for us that one man should
die for the people, and not that the
whole na on should perish."JOHN 11
81
51 Now this he did not say on his own
authority; but being high priest that year
he prophesied that Jesus would die for
the na on,
52 and not for that na on only, but also
that He would gather together in one
the children of God who were sca ered
abroad.
53 Then, from that day on, they plo ed
to put Him to death.
54 Therefore Jesus no longer walked
openly among the Jews, but went
from there into the country near the
wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and
there remained with His disciples.
55 And the Passover of the Jews was
near, and many went from the country
up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to
purify themselves.
56 Then they sought Jesus, and spoke
among themselves as they stood in theJOHN 11 – 12
82
temple, "What do you think––that He
will not come to the feast?"
57 Now both the chief priests and the
Pharisees had given a command, that if
anyone knew where He was, he should
report it, that they might seize Him.
1 Then, six days before the
Passover, Jesus came to Bethany,
where Lazarus was who had been dead,
whom He had raised from the dead.
2 There they made Him a supper; and
Martha served, but Lazarus was one of
those who sat at the table with Him.
3 Then Mary took a pound of very
costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet
of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her
hair. And the house was ﬁlled with the
fragrance of the oil.
4 Then one of His disciples, Judas
Iscariot, Simon’s son, who would betray
Him, said,
12JOHN 12
83
5 "Why was this fragrant oil not sold for
three hundred denarii and given to the
poor?"
6 This he said, not that he cared for the
poor, but because he was a thief, and
had the money box; and he used to take
what was put in it.
7 But Jesus said, "Let her alone; she has
kept this for the day of My burial.
8 "For the poor you have with you
always, but Me you do not have always."
9 Now a great many of the Jews knew
that He was there; and they came, not
for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might
also see Lazarus, whom He had raised
from the dead.
10 But the chief priests plo ed to put
Lazarus to death also,
11 because on account of him many
of the Jews went away and believed in
Jesus.JOHN 12
12 The next day a great mul
84
tude that
had come to the feast, when they heard
that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
13 took branches of palm trees and
went out to meet Him, and cried out:
"Hosanna! ‘Blessed is He who comes
in the name of the LORD!’ The King of
Israel!"
14 Then Jesus, when He had found a
young donkey, sat on it; as it is wri en:
15 "Fear not, daughter of Zion; Behold,
your King is coming, Si ng on a donkey’s
colt."
16 His disciples did not understand
these things at ﬁrst; but when Jesus was
gloriﬁed, then they remembered that
these things were wri en about Him and
that they had done these things to Him.
17 Therefore the people, who were with
Him when He called Lazarus out of his
tomb and raised him from the dead,
bore witness.JOHN 12
85
18 For this reason the people also met
Him, because they heard that He had
done this sign.
19 The Pharisees therefore said among
themselves, "You see that you are
accomplishing nothing. Look, the world
has gone a er Him!"
20 Now there were certain Greeks
among those who came up to worship at
the feast.
21 Then they came to Philip, who was
from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked
him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
22 Philip came and told Andrew, and in
turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
23 But Jesus answered them, saying,
"The hour has come that the Son of Man
should be gloriﬁed.
24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless
a grain of wheat falls into the ground
and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies,
it produces much grain.JOHN 12
86
25 "He who loves his life will lose it, and
he who hates his life in this world will
keep it for eternal life.
26 "If anyone serves Me, let him follow
Me; and where I am, there My servant
will be also. If anyone serves Me, him
My Father will honor.
27 "Now My soul is troubled, and what
shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this
hour’? But for this purpose I came to this
hour.
28 "Father, glorify Your name." Then a
voice came from heaven, saying, "I have
both gloriﬁed it and will glorify it again."
29 Therefore the people who stood by
and heard it said that it had thundered.
Others said, "An angel has spoken to
Him."
30 Jesus answered and said, "This voice
did not come because of Me, but for
your sake.JOHN 12
87
31 "Now is the judgment of this world;
now the ruler of this world will be cast
out.
32 "And I, if I am li ed up from the
earth, will draw all peoples to Myself."
33 This He said, signifying by what death
He would die.
34 The people answered Him, "We
have heard from the law that the Christ
remains forever; and how can You say,
‘The Son of Man must be li ed up’? Who
is this Son of Man?"
35 Then Jesus said to them, "A li le
while longer the light is with you. Walk
while you have the light, lest darkness
overtake you; he who walks in darkness
does not know where he is going.
36 "While you have the light, believe
in the light, that you may become sons
of light." These things Jesus spoke, and
departed, and was hidden from them.JOHN 12
88
37 But although He had done so many
signs before them, they did not believe
in Him,
38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet
might be fulﬁlled, which he spoke: "Lord,
who has believed our report? And to
whom has the arm of the LORD been
revealed?"
39 Therefore they could not believe,
because Isaiah said again:
40 "He has blinded their eyes and
hardened their hearts, Lest they should
see with their eyes, Lest they should
understand with their hearts and turn,
So that I should heal them."
41 These things Isaiah said when he saw
His glory and spoke of Him.
42 Nevertheless even among the rulers
many believed in Him, but because
of the Pharisees they did not confess
Him, lest they should be put out of the
synagogue;JOHN 12
89
43 for they loved the praise of men
more than the praise of God.
44 Then Jesus cried out and said, "He
who believes in Me, believes not in Me
but in Him who sent Me.
45 "And he who sees Me sees Him who
sent Me.
46 "I have come as a light into the world,
that whoever believes in Me should not
abide in darkness.
47 "And if anyone hears My words and
does not believe, I do not judge him; for
I did not come to judge the world but to
save the world.
48 "He who rejects Me, and does not
receive My words, has that which judges
him––the word that I have spoken will
judge him in the last day.
49 "For I have not spoken on My own
authority; but the Father who sent Me
gave Me a command, what I should say
and what I should speak.JOHN 12 – 13
90
50 "And I know that His command is
everlas ng life. Therefore, whatever I
speak, just as the Father has told Me, so
I speak."
1 Now before the feast of the
Passover, when Jesus knew that
His hour had come that He should depart
from this world to the Father, having
loved His own who were in the world,
He loved them to the end.
2 And supper being ended, the devil
having already put it into the heart of
Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray
Him,
3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had
given all things into His hands, and that
He had come from God and was going to
God,
4 rose from supper and laid aside His
garments, took a towel and girded
Himself.
13JOHN 13
5A
91
er that, He poured water into a
basin and began to wash the disciples’
feet, and to wipe them with the towel
with which He was girded.
6 Then He came to Simon Peter. And
Peter said to Him, "Lord, are You washing
my feet?"
7 Jesus answered and said to him,
"What I am doing you do not understand
now, but you will know a er this."
8 Peter said to Him, "You shall never
wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I
do not wash you, you have no part with
Me."
9 Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, not
my feet only, but also my hands and my
head!"
10 Jesus said to him, "He who is bathed
needs only to wash his feet, but is
completely clean; and you are clean, but
not all of you."JOHN 13
92
11 For He knew who would betray Him;
therefore He said, "You are not all clean."
12 So when He had washed their feet,
taken His garments, and sat down again,
He said to them, "Do you know what I
have done to you?
13 "You call me Teacher and Lord, and
you say well, for so I am.
14 "If I then, your Lord and Teacher,
have washed your feet, you also ought
to wash one another’s feet.
15 "For I have given you an example,
that you should do as I have done to you.
16 "Most assuredly, I say to you, a
servant is not greater than his master;
nor is he who is sent greater than he
who sent him.
17 "If you know these things, blessed
are you if you do them.
18 "I do not speak concerning all of you.
I know whom I have chosen; but that
the Scripture may be fulﬁlled, ‘He whoJOHN 13
93
eats bread with Me has li ed up his heel
against Me.’
19 "Now I tell you before it comes, that
when it does come to pass, you may
believe that I am He.
20 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who
receives whomever I send receives Me;
and he who receives Me receives Him
who sent Me."
21 When Jesus had said these things, He
was troubled in spirit, and tes ﬁed and
said, "Most assuredly, I say to you, one
of you will betray Me."
22 Then the disciples looked at one
another, perplexed about whom He
spoke.
23 Now there was leaning on Jesus’
bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus
loved.
24 Simon Peter therefore mo oned
to him to ask who it was of whom He
spoke.JOHN 13
94
25 Then, leaning back on Jesus’ breast,
he said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"
26 Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I
shall give a piece of bread when I have
dipped it." And having dipped the bread,
He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of
Simon.
27 Now a er the piece of bread, Satan
entered him. Then Jesus said to him,
"What you do, do quickly."
28 But no one at the table knew for
what reason He said this to him.
29 For some thought, because Judas had
the money box, that Jesus had said to
him, "Buy those things we need for the
feast," or that he should give something
to the poor.
30 Having received the piece of bread,
he then went out immediately. And it
was night.JOHN 13
95
31 So, when he had gone out, Jesus said,
"Now the Son of Man is gloriﬁed, and
God is gloriﬁed in Him.
32 "If God is gloriﬁed in Him, God will
also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify
Him immediately.
33 "Li le children, I shall be with you a
li le while longer. You will seek Me; and
as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going,
you cannot come,’ so now I say to you.
34 "A new commandment I give to
you, that you love one another; as I
have loved you, that you also love one
another.
35 "By this all will know that you are
My disciples, if you have love for one
another."
36 Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord,
where are You going?" Jesus answered
him, "Where I am going you cannot
follow Me now, but you shall follow Me
a erward."JOHN 13 – 14
96
37 Peter said to Him, "Lord, why can I
not follow You now? I will lay down my
life for Your sake."
38 Jesus answered him, "Will you lay
down your life for My sake? Most
assuredly, I say to you, the rooster shall
not crow ll you have denied Me three
mes.
1 "Let not your heart be troubled;
you believe in God, believe also in
Me.
2 "In My Father’s house are many
mansions; if it were not so, I would have
told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
3 "And if I go and prepare a place for
you, I will come again and receive you to
Myself; that where I am, there you may
be also.
4 "And where I go you know, and the
way you know."
14JOHN 14
97
5 Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not
know where You are going, and how can
we know the way?"
6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the
truth, and the life. No one comes to the
Father except through Me.
7 "If you had known Me, you would
have known My Father also; and from
now on you know Him and have seen
Him."
8 Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the
Father, and it is suﬃcient for us."
9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with
you so long, and yet you have not known
Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has
seen the Father; so how can you say,
‘Show us the Father’?
10 "Do you not believe that I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me? The words
that I speak to you I do not speak on
My own authority; but the Father who
dwells in Me does the works.JOHN 14
98
11 "Believe Me that I am in the Father
and the Father in Me, or else believe Me
for the sake of the works themselves.
12 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who
believes in Me, the works that I do he
will do also; and greater works than
these he will do, because I go to My
Father.
13 "And whatever you ask in My name,
that I will do, that the Father may be
gloriﬁed in the Son.
14 "If you ask anything in My name, I
will do it.
15 "If you love Me, keep My
commandments.
16 "And I will pray the Father, and He
will give you another Helper, that He
may abide with you forever––
17 "the Spirit of truth, whom the world
cannot receive, because it neither sees
Him nor knows Him; but you know Him,
for He dwells with you and will be in you.JOHN 14
99
18 "I will not leave you orphans; I will
come to you.
19 "A li le while longer and the world
will see Me no more, but you will see
Me. Because I live, you will live also.
20 "At that day you will know that I am
in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
21 "He who has My commandments and
keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And
he who loves Me will be loved by My
Father, and I will love him and manifest
Myself to him."
22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him,
"Lord, how is it that You will manifest
Yourself to us, and not to the world?"
23 Jesus answered and said to him, "If
anyone loves Me, he will keep My word;
and My Father will love him, and We will
come to him and make Our home with
him.
24 "He who does not love Me does not
keep My words; and the word which youJOHN 14
100
hear is not Mine but the Father’s who
sent Me.
25 "These things I have spoken to you
while being present with you.
26 "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father will send in My name,
He will teach you all things, and bring to
your remembrance all things that I said
to you.
27 "Peace I leave with you, My peace
I give to you; not as the world gives
do I give to you. Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be afraid.
28 "You have heard Me say to you, ‘I
am going away and coming back to
you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice
because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’
for My Father is greater than I.
29 "And now I have told you before it
comes, that when it does come to pass,
you may believe.JOHN 14 – 15
101
30 "I will no longer talk much with you,
for the ruler of this world is coming, and
he has nothing in Me.
31 "But that the world may know that I
love the Father, and as the Father gave
Me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us
go from here.
1 "I am the true vine, and My
Father is the vinedresser.
2 "Every branch in Me that does not
bear fruit He takes away; and every
branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it
may bear more fruit.
3 "You are already clean because of the
word which I have spoken to you.
4 "Abide in Me, and I in you. As the
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless
it abides in the vine, neither can you,
unless you abide in Me.
5 "I am the vine, you are the branches.
He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears
15JOHN 15
102
much fruit; for without Me you can do
nothing.
6 "If anyone does not abide in Me, he is
cast out as a branch and is withered; and
they gather them and throw them into
the ﬁre, and they are burned.
7 "If you abide in Me, and My words
abide in you, you will ask what you
desire, and it shall be done for you.
8 "By this My Father is gloriﬁed, that
you bear much fruit; so you will be My
disciples.
9 "As the Father loved Me, I also have
loved you; abide in My love.
10 "If you keep My commandments, you
will abide in My love, just as I have kept
My Father’s commandments and abide
in His love.
11 "These things I have spoken to you,
that My joy may remain in you, and that
your joy may be full.JOHN 15
103
12 "This is My commandment, that you
love one another as I have loved you.
13 "Greater love has no one than this,
than to lay down one’s life for his friends.
14 "You are My friends if you do
whatever I command you.
15 "No longer do I call you servants, for
a servant does not know what his master
is doing; but I have called you friends,
for all things that I heard from My Father
I have made known to you.
16 "You did not choose Me, but I chose
you and appointed you that you should
go and bear fruit, and that your fruit
should remain, that whatever you ask
the Father in My name He may give you.
17 "These things I command you, that
you love one another.
18 "If the world hates you, you know
that it hated Me before it hated you.
19 "If you were of the world, the world
would love its own. Yet because you areJOHN 15
104
not of the world, but I chose you out
of the world, therefore the world hates
you.
20 "Remember the word that I said to
you, ‘A servant is not greater than his
master.’ If they persecuted Me, they
will also persecute you. If they kept My
word, they will keep yours also.
21 "But all these things they will do to
you for My name’s sake, because they
do not know Him who sent Me.
22 "If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would have no sin, but now
they have no excuse for their sin.
23 "He who hates Me hates My Father
also.
24 "If I had not done among them the
works which no one else did, they would
have no sin; but now they have seen and
also hated both Me and My Father.JOHN 15 – 16
105
25 "But this happened that the word
might be fulﬁlled which is wri en in their
law, ‘They hated Me without a cause.’
26 "But when the Helper comes, whom
I shall send to you from the Father, the
Spirit of truth who proceeds from the
Father, He will tes fy of Me.
27 "And you also will bear witness,
because you have been with Me from
the beginning.
1 "These things I have spoken to
you, that you should not be made
to stumble.
2 "They will put you out of the
synagogues; yes, the me is coming that
whoever kills you will think that he oﬀers
God service.
3 "And these things they will do to you
because they have not known the Father
nor Me.
4 "But these things I have told you,
that when the me comes, you may
16JOHN 16
106
remember that I told you of them. And
these things I did not say to you at the
beginning, because I was with you.
5 "But now I go away to Him who sent
Me, and none of you asks Me, ‘Where
are You going?’
6 "But because I have said these things
to you, sorrow has ﬁlled your heart.
7 "Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It
is to your advantage that I go away; for
if I do not go away, the Helper will not
come to you; but if I depart, I will send
Him to you.
8 "And when He has come, He will
convict the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment:
9 "of sin, because they do not believe in
Me;
10 "of righteousness, because I go to My
Father and you see Me no more;
11 "of judgment, because the ruler of
this world is judged.JOHN 16
12 "I s
107
ll have many things to say to you,
but you cannot bear them now.
13 "However, when He, the Spirit of
truth, has come, He will guide you into
all truth; for He will not speak on His
own authority, but whatever He hears
He will speak; and He will tell you things
to come.
14 "He will glorify Me, for He will take of
what is Mine and declare it to you.
15 "All things that the Father has are
Mine. Therefore I said that He will take
of Mine and declare it to you.
16 "A li le while, and you will not see
Me; and again a li le while, and you will
see Me, because I go to the Father."
17 Then some of His disciples said
among themselves, "What is this that He
says to us, ‘A li le while, and you will not
see Me; and again a li le while, and you
will see Me’; and, ‘because I go to the
Father’?"JOHN 16
108
18 They said therefore, "What is this
that He says, ‘A li le while’? We do not
know what He is saying."
19 Now Jesus knew that they desired to
ask Him, and He said to them, "Are you
inquiring among yourselves about what I
said, ‘A li le while, and you will not see
Me; and again a li le while, and you will
see Me’?
20 "Most assuredly, I say to you that you
will weep and lament, but the world will
rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but
your sorrow will be turned into joy.
21 "A woman, when she is in labor, has
sorrow because her hour has come;
but as soon as she has given birth to
the child, she no longer remembers the
anguish, for joy that a human being has
been born into the world.
22 "Therefore you now have sorrow;
but I will see you again and your heartJOHN 16
109
will rejoice, and your joy no one will take
from you.
23 "And in that day you will ask Me
nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you,
whatever you ask the Father in My name
He will give you.
24 "Un l now you have asked nothing in
My name. Ask, and you will receive, that
your joy may be full.
25 "These things I have spoken to you
in ﬁgura ve language; but the me is
coming when I will no longer speak to
you in ﬁgura ve language, but I will tell
you plainly about the Father.
26 "In that day you will ask in My name,
and I do not say to you that I shall pray
the Father for you;
27 "for the Father Himself loves you,
because you have loved Me, and have
believed that I came forth from God.JOHN 16
110
28 "I came forth from the Father and
have come into the world. Again, I leave
the world and go to the Father."
29 His disciples said to Him, "See, now
You are speaking plainly, and using no
ﬁgure of speech!
30 "Now we are sure that You know all
things, and have no need that anyone
should ques on You. By this we believe
that You came forth from God."
31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now
believe?
32 "Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has
now come, that you will be sca ered,
each to his own, and will leave Me alone.
And yet I am not alone, because the
Father is with Me.
33 "These things I have spoken to you,
that in Me you may have peace. In the
world you will have tribula on; but be of
good cheer, I have overcome the world."JOHN 17
1 Jesus spoke these words, li
111
ed
up His eyes to heaven, and said:
"Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your
Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,
2 "as You have given Him authority over
all ﬂesh, that He should give eternal life
to as many as You have given Him.
3 "And this is eternal life, that they may
know You, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom You have sent.
4 "I have gloriﬁed You on the earth. I
have ﬁnished the work which You have
given Me to do.
5 "And now, O Father, glorify Me
together with Yourself, with the glory
which I had with You before the world
was.
6 "I have manifested Your name to the
men whom You have given Me out of the
world. They were Yours, You gave them
to Me, and they have kept Your word.
17JOHN 17
112
7 "Now they have known that all things
which You have given Me are from You.
8 "For I have given to them the words
which You have given Me; and they have
received them, and have known surely
that I came forth from You; and they
have believed that You sent Me.
9 "I pray for them. I do not pray for the
world but for those whom You have
given Me, for they are Yours.
10 "And all Mine are Yours, and Yours
are Mine, and I am gloriﬁed in them.
11 "Now I am no longer in the world,
but these are in the world, and I come
to You. Holy Father, keep through Your
name those whom You have given Me,
that they may be one as We are.
12 "While I was with them in the world,
I kept them in Your name. Those whom
You gave Me I have kept; and none of
them is lost except the son of perdi on,
that the Scripture might be fulﬁlled.JOHN 17
113
13 "But now I come to You, and these
things I speak in the world, that they
may have My joy fulﬁlled in themselves.
14 "I have given them Your word; and
the world has hated them because they
are not of the world, just as I am not of
the world.
15 "I do not pray that You should take
them out of the world, but that You
should keep them from the evil one.
16 "They are not of the world, just as I
am not of the world.
17 "Sanc fy them by Your truth. Your
word is truth.
18 "As You sent Me into the world, I also
have sent them into the world.
19 "And for their sakes I sanc fy Myself,
that they also may be sanc ﬁed by the
truth.
20 "I do not pray for these alone, but
also for those who will believe in Me
through their word;JOHN 17
114
21 "that they all may be one, as You,
Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they
also may be one in Us, that the world
may believe that You sent Me.
22 "And the glory which You gave Me I
have given them, that they may be one
just as We are one:
23 "I in them, and You in Me; that they
may be made perfect in one, and that
the world may know that You have sent
Me, and have loved them as You have
loved Me.
24 "Father, I desire that they also whom
You gave Me may be with Me where
I am, that they may behold My glory
which You have given Me; for You loved
Me before the founda on of the world.
25 "O righteous Father! The world has
not known You, but I have known You;
and these have known that You sent Me.
26 "And I have declared to them Your
name, and will declare it, that the loveJOHN 18
115
with which You loved Me may be in
them, and I in them."
1 When Jesus had spoken these
words, He went out with His
disciples over the Brook Kidron, where
there was a garden, which He and His
disciples entered.
2 And Judas, who betrayed Him, also
knew the place; for Jesus o en met
there with His disciples.
3 Then Judas, having received a
detachment of troops, and oﬃcers
from the chief priests and Pharisees,
came there with lanterns, torches, and
weapons.
4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things
that would come upon Him, went
forward and said to them, "Whom are
you seeking?"
5 They answered Him, "Jesus of
Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am
18JOHN 18
116
He." And Judas, who betrayed Him, also
stood with them.
6 Now when He said to them, "I am He,"
they drew back and fell to the ground.
7 Then He asked them again, "Whom
are you seeking?" And they said, "Jesus
of Nazareth."
8 Jesus answered, "I have told you that
I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let
these go their way,"
9 that the saying might be fulﬁlled
which He spoke, "Of those whom You
gave Me I have lost none."
10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword,
drew it and struck the high priest’s
servant, and cut oﬀ his right ear. The
servant’s name was Malchus.
11 So Jesus said to Peter, "Put your
sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink
the cup which My Father has given Me?"JOHN 18
117
12 Then the detachment of troops and
the captain and the oﬃcers of the Jews
arrested Jesus and bound Him.
13 And they led Him away to Annas ﬁrst,
for he was the father–in–law of Caiaphas
who was high priest that year.
14 Now it was Caiaphas who advised
the Jews that it was expedient that one
man should die for the people.
15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus,
and so did another disciple. Now that
disciple was known to the high priest,
and went with Jesus into the courtyard
of the high priest.
16 But Peter stood at the door outside.
Then the other disciple, who was known
to the high priest, went out and spoke
to her who kept the door, and brought
Peter in.
17 Then the servant girl who kept the
door said to Peter, "You are not also oneJOHN 18
118
of this Man’s disciples, are you?" He
said, "I am not."
18 Now the servants and oﬃcers who
had made a ﬁre of coals stood there,
for it was cold, and they warmed
themselves. And Peter stood with them
and warmed himself.
19 The high priest then asked Jesus
about His disciples and His doctrine.
20 Jesus answered him, "I spoke
openly to the world. I always taught in
synagogues and in the temple, where
the Jews always meet, and in secret I
have said nothing.
21 "Why do you ask Me? Ask those who
have heard Me what I said to them.
Indeed they know what I said."
22 And when He had said these things,
one of the oﬃcers who stood by struck
Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying,
"Do You answer the high priest like
that?"JOHN 18
119
23 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken
evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well,
why do you strike Me?"
24 Then Annas sent Him bound to
Caiaphas the high priest.
25 Now Simon Peter stood and warmed
himself. Therefore they said to him, "You
are not also one of His disciples, are
you?" He denied it and said, "I am not!"
26 One of the servants of the high
priest, a rela ve of him whose ear Peter
cut oﬀ, said, "Did I not see you in the
garden with Him?"
27 Peter then denied again; and
immediately a rooster crowed.
28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas
to the Praetorium, and it was early
morning. But they themselves did not
go into the Praetorium, lest they should
be deﬁled, but that they might eat the
Passover.JOHN 18
120
29 Pilate then went out to them and
said, "What accusa on do you bring
against this Man?"
30 They answered and said to him, "If
He were not an evildoer, we would not
have delivered Him up to you."
31 Then Pilate said to them, "You take
Him and judge Him according to your
law." Therefore the Jews said to him,
"It is not lawful for us to put anyone to
death,"
32 that the saying of Jesus might be
fulﬁlled which He spoke, signifying by
what death He would die.
33 Then Pilate entered the Praetorium
again, called Jesus, and said to Him, "Are
You the King of the Jews?"
34 Jesus answered him, "Are you
speaking for yourself about this, or did
others tell you this concerning Me?"
35 Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your
own na on and the chief priests haveJOHN 18
121
delivered You to me. What have You
done?"
36 Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not
of this world. If My kingdom were of this
world, My servants would ﬁght, so that I
should not be delivered to the Jews; but
now My kingdom is not from here."
37 Pilate therefore said to Him, "Are You
a king then?" Jesus answered, "You say
rightly that I am a king. For this cause
I was born, and for this cause I have
come into the world, that I should bear
witness to the truth. Everyone who is of
the truth hears My voice."
38 Pilate said to Him, "What is truth?"
And when he had said this, he went out
again to the Jews, and said to them, "I
ﬁnd no fault in Him at all.
39 "But you have a custom that I should
release someone to you at the Passover.
Do you therefore want me to release to
you the King of the Jews?"JOHN 18 – 19
122
40 Then they all cried again, saying, "Not
this Man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas
was a robber.
1 So then Pilate took Jesus and
scourged Him.
2 And the soldiers twisted a crown of
thorns and put it on His head, and they
put on Him a purple robe.
3 Then they said, "Hail, King of the
Jews!" And they struck Him with their
hands.
4 Pilate then went out again, and said
to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out
to you, that you may know that I ﬁnd no
fault in Him."
5 Then Jesus came out, wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple robe.
And Pilate said to them, "Behold the
Man!"
6 Therefore, when the chief priests and
oﬃcers saw Him, they cried out, saying,
"Crucify Him, crucify Him!" Pilate said to
19JOHN 19
123
them, "You take Him and crucify Him, for
I ﬁnd no fault in Him."
7 The Jews answered him, "We have a
law, and according to our law He ought
to die, because He made Himself the Son
of God."
8 Therefore, when Pilate heard that
saying, he was the more afraid,
9 and went again into the Praetorium,
and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?"
But Jesus gave him no answer.
10 Then Pilate said to Him, "Are You not
speaking to me? Do You not know that I
have power to crucify You, and power to
release You?"
11 Jesus answered, "You could have no
power at all against Me unless it had
been given you from above. Therefore
the one who delivered Me to you has
the greater sin."
12 From then on Pilate sought to release
Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "IfJOHN 19
124
you let this Man go, you are not Caesar’s
friend. Whoever makes himself a king
speaks against Caesar."
13 When Pilate therefore heard that
saying, he brought Jesus out and sat
down in the judgment seat in a place
that is called The Pavement, but in
Hebrew, Gabbatha.
14 Now it was the Prepara on Day of
the Passover, and about the sixth hour.
And he said to the Jews, "Behold your
King!"
15 But they cried out, "Away with Him,
away with Him! Crucify Him!" Pilate said
to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The
chief priests answered, "We have no
king but Caesar!"
16 Then he delivered Him to them to be
cruciﬁed. So they took Jesus and led Him
away.JOHN 19
125
17 And He, bearing His cross, went out
to a place called the Place of a Skull,
which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,
18 where they cruciﬁed Him, and two
others with Him, one on either side, and
Jesus in the center.
19 Now Pilate wrote a tle and put it on
the cross. And the wri ng was: JESUS OF
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
20 Then many of the Jews read this tle,
for the place where Jesus was cruciﬁed
was near the city; and it was wri en in
Hebrew, Greek, and La n.
21 Therefore the chief priests of the
Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, ‘The
King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, "I am the
King of the Jews."’"
22 Pilate answered, "What I have
wri en, I have wri en."
23 Then the soldiers, when they had
cruciﬁed Jesus, took His garments and
made four parts, to each soldier a part,JOHN 19
126
and also the tunic. Now the tunic was
without seam, woven from the top in
one piece.
24 They said therefore among
themselves, "Let us not tear it, but cast
lots for it, whose it shall be," that the
Scripture might be fulﬁlled which says:
"They divided My garments among
them, And for My clothing they cast
lots." Therefore the soldiers did these
things.
25 Now there stood by the cross of
Jesus His mother, and His mother’s
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
Magdalene.
26 When Jesus therefore saw His
mother, and the disciple whom He loved
standing by, He said to His mother,
"Woman, behold your son!"
27 Then He said to the disciple, "Behold
your mother!" And from that hour that
disciple took her to his own home.JOHN 19
28 A
127
er this, Jesus, knowing that all
things were now accomplished, that
the Scripture might be fulﬁlled, said, "I
thirst!"
29 Now a vessel full of sour wine was
si ng there; and they ﬁlled a sponge
with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put
it to His mouth.
30 So when Jesus had received the
sour wine, He said, "It is ﬁnished!" And
bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
31 Therefore, because it was the
Prepara on Day, that the bodies should
not remain on the cross on the Sabbath
(for that Sabbath was a high day), the
Jews asked Pilate that their legs might
be broken, and that they might be taken
away.
32 Then the soldiers came and broke
the legs of the ﬁrst and of the other who
was cruciﬁed with Him.JOHN 19
128
33 But when they came to Jesus and
saw that He was already dead, they did
not break His legs.
34 But one of the soldiers pierced His
side with a spear, and immediately blood
and water came out.
35 And he who has seen has tes ﬁed,
and his tes mony is true; and he knows
that he is telling the truth, so that you
may believe.
36 For these things were done that the
Scripture should be fulﬁlled, "Not one of
His bones shall be broken."
37 And again another Scripture says,
"They shall look on Him whom they
pierced."
38 A er this, Joseph of Arimathea,
being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly,
for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he
might take away the body of Jesus; and
Pilate gave him permission. So he came
and took the body of Jesus.JOHN 19 – 20
129
39 And Nicodemus, who at ﬁrst came
to Jesus by night, also came, bringing
a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a
hundred pounds.
40 Then they took the body of Jesus,
and bound it in strips of linen with the
spices, as the custom of the Jews is to
bury.
41 Now in the place where He was
cruciﬁed there was a garden, and in the
garden a new tomb in which no one had
yet been laid.
42 So there they laid Jesus, because of
the Jews’ Prepara on Day, for the tomb
was nearby.
1 Now on the ﬁrst day of the week
Mary Magdalene went to the
tomb early, while it was s ll dark, and
saw that the stone had been taken away
from the tomb.
2 Then she ran and came to Simon
Peter, and to the other disciple, whom
20JOHN 20
130
Jesus loved, and said to them, "They
have taken away the Lord out of the
tomb, and we do not know where they
have laid Him."
3 Peter therefore went out, and the
other disciple, and were going to the
tomb.
4 So they both ran together, and the
other disciple outran Peter and came to
the tomb ﬁrst.
5 And he, stooping down and looking in,
saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he
did not go in.
6 Then Simon Peter came, following
him, and went into the tomb; and he
saw the linen cloths lying there,
7 and the handkerchief that had been
around His head, not lying with the linen
cloths, but folded together in a place by
itself.JOHN 20
131
8 Then the other disciple, who came to
the tomb ﬁrst, went in also; and he saw
and believed.
9 For as yet they did not know the
Scripture, that He must rise again from
the dead.
10 Then the disciples went away again
to their own homes.
11 But Mary stood outside by the tomb
weeping, and as she wept she stooped
down and looked into the tomb.
12 And she saw two angels in white
si ng, one at the head and the other at
the feet, where the body of Jesus had
lain.
13 Then they said to her, "Woman, why
are you weeping?" She said to them,
"Because they have taken away my Lord,
and I do not know where they have laid
Him."
14 Now when she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standingJOHN 20
132
there, and did not know that it was
Jesus.
15 Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are
you weeping? Whom are you seeking?"
She, supposing Him to be the gardener,
said to Him, "Sir, if You have carried Him
away, tell me where You have laid Him,
and I will take Him away."
16 Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned
and said to Him, "Rabboni!" (which is to
say, Teacher).
17 Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to Me,
for I have not yet ascended to My Father;
but go to My brethren and say to them,
‘I am ascending to My Father and your
Father, and to My God and your God.’"
18 Mary Magdalene came and told the
disciples that she had seen the Lord, and
that He had spoken these things to her.
19 Then, the same day at evening, being
the ﬁrst day of the week, when the doors
were shut where the disciples wereJOHN 20
133
assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus
came and stood in the midst, and said to
them, "Peace be with you."
20 When He had said this, He showed
them His hands and His side. Then the
disciples were glad when they saw the
Lord.
21 So Jesus said to them again, "Peace
to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also
send you."
22 And when He had said this, He
breathed on them, and said to them,
"Receive the Holy Spirit.
23 "If you forgive the sins of any, they
are forgiven them; if you retain the sins
of any, they are retained."
24 Now Thomas, called the Twin, one
of the twelve, was not with them when
Jesus came.
25 The other disciples therefore said to
him, "We have seen the Lord." So he said
to them, "Unless I see in His hands theJOHN 20
134
print of the nails, and put my ﬁnger into
the print of the nails, and put my hand
into His side, I will not believe."
26 And a er eight days His disciples
were again inside, and Thomas with
them. Jesus came, the doors being shut,
and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace
to you!"
27 Then He said to Thomas, "Reach your
ﬁnger here, and look at My hands; and
reach your hand here, and put it into
My side. Do not be unbelieving, but
believing."
28 And Thomas answered and said to
Him, "My Lord and my God!"
29 Jesus said to him, "Thomas, because
you have seen Me, you have believed.
Blessed are those who have not seen
and yet have believed."
30 And truly Jesus did many other signs
in the presence of His disciples, which
are not wri en in this book;JOHN 20 – 21
31 but these are wri
135
en that you may
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of God, and that believing you may have
life in His name.
1 A er these things Jesus showed
Himself again to the disciples at
the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way He
showed Himself:
2 Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin,
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of
Zebedee, and two others of His disciples
were together.
3 Simon Peter said to them, "I am going
ﬁshing." They said to him, "We are
going with you also." They went out and
immediately got into the boat, and that
night they caught nothing.
4 But when the morning had now
come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the
disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
21JOHN 21
136
5 Then Jesus said to them, "Children,
have you any food?" They answered
Him, "No."
6 And He said to them, "Cast the net on
the right side of the boat, and you will
ﬁnd some." So they cast, and now they
were not able to draw it in because of
the mul tude of ﬁsh.
7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus
loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" Now
when Simon Peter heard that it was the
Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he
had removed it), and plunged into the
sea.
8 But the other disciples came in the
li le boat (for they were not far from
land, but about two hundred cubits),
dragging the net with ﬁsh.
9 Then, as soon as they had come to
land, they saw a ﬁre of coals there, and
ﬁsh laid on it, and bread.JOHN 21
137
10 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of
the ﬁsh which you have just caught."
11 Simon Peter went up and dragged
the net to land, full of large ﬁsh, one
hundred and ﬁ y–three; and although
there were so many, the net was not
broken.
12 Jesus said to them, "Come and eat
breakfast." Yet none of the disciples
dared ask Him, "Who are You?"
––knowing that it was the Lord.
13 Jesus then came and took the bread
and gave it to them, and likewise the
ﬁsh.
14 This is now the third me Jesus
showed Himself to His disciples a er He
was raised from the dead.
15 So when they had eaten breakfast,
Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son
of Jonah, do you love Me more than
these?" He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; YouJOHN 21
138
know that I love You." He said to him,
"Feed My lambs."
16 He said to him again a second me,
"Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?"
He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know
that I love You." He said to him, "Tend
My sheep."
17 He said to him the third me, "Simon,
son of Jonah, do you love Me?" Peter
was grieved because He said to him the
third me, "Do you love Me?" And he
said to Him, "Lord, You know all things;
You know that I love You." Jesus said to
him, "Feed My sheep.
18 "Most assuredly, I say to you, when
you were younger, you girded yourself
and walked where you wished; but when
you are old, you will stretch out your
hands, and another will gird you and
carry you where you do not wish."
19 This He spoke, signifying by what
death he would glorify God. And whenJOHN 21
139
He had spoken this, He said to him,
"Follow Me."
20 Then Peter, turning around, saw the
disciple whom Jesus loved following,
who also had leaned on His breast at the
supper, and said, "Lord, who is the one
who betrays You?"
21 Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "But
Lord, what about this man?"
22 Jesus said to him, "If I will that he
remain ll I come, what is that to you?
You follow Me."
23 Then this saying went out among the
brethren that this disciple would not
die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that
he would not die, but, "If I will that he
remain ll I come, what is that to you?"
24 This is the disciple who tes ﬁes of
these things, and wrote these things;
and we know that his tes mony is true.
25 And there are also many other things
that Jesus did, which if they were wri enJOHN 21
140
one by one, I suppose that even the
world itself could not contain the books
that would be wri en. Amen.Acts of the Apostles
1
1 The former account I made, O
Theophilus, of all that Jesus began
both to do and teach,
2 un l the day in which He was taken
up, a er He through the Holy Spirit had
given commandments to the apostles
whom He had chosen,
3 to whom He also presented Himself
alive a er His suﬀering by many infallible
proofs, being seen by them during
forty days and speaking of the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God.
4 And being assembled together with
them, He commanded them not to
depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for
the Promise of the Father, "which," He
said, "you have heard from Me;ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5 "for John truly bap
2
zed with water,
but you shall be bap zed with the Holy
Spirit not many days from now."
6 Therefore, when they had come
together, they asked Him, saying, "Lord,
will You at this me restore the kingdom
to Israel?"
7 And He said to them, "It is not for
you to know mes or seasons which the
Father has put in His own authority.
8 "But you shall receive power when the
Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you
shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem,
and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the
end of the earth."
9 Now when He had spoken these
things, while they watched, He was
taken up, and a cloud received Him out
of their sight.
10 And while they looked steadfastly
toward heaven as He went up, behold,
two men stood by them in white apparel,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
3
11 who also said, "Men of Galilee, why
do you stand gazing up into heaven? This
same Jesus, who was taken up from you
into heaven, will so come in like manner
as you saw Him go into heaven."
12 Then they returned to Jerusalem
from the mount called Olivet, which is
near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey.
13 And when they had entered, they
went up into the upper room where
they were staying: Peter, James, John,
and Andrew; Philip and Thomas;
Bartholomew and Ma hew; James the
son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot;
and Judas the son of James.
14 These all con nued with one accord
in prayer and supplica on, with the
women and Mary the mother of Jesus,
and with His brothers.
15 And in those days Peter stood up in
the midst of the disciples (altogether theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
4
number of names was about a hundred
and twenty), and said,
16 "Men and brethren, this Scripture
had to be fulﬁlled, which the Holy Spirit
spoke before by the mouth of David
concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
17 "for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry."
18 (Now this man purchased a ﬁeld
with the wages of iniquity; and falling
headlong, he burst open in the middle
and all his entrails gushed out.
19 And it became known to all those
dwelling in Jerusalem; so that ﬁeld is
called in their own language, Akel Dama,
that is, Field of Blood.)
20 "For it is wri en in the book of
Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it’; and,
‘Let another take his oﬃce.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5
21 "Therefore, of these men who have
accompanied us all the me that the
Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
22 "beginning from the bap sm of John
to that day when He was taken up from
us, one of these must become a witness
with us of His resurrec on."
23 And they proposed two: Joseph
called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Ma hias.
24 And they prayed and said, "You, O
Lord, who know the hearts of all, show
which of these two You have chosen
25 "to take part in this ministry and
apostleship from which Judas by
transgression fell, that he might go to his
own place."
26 And they cast their lots, and the lot
fell on Ma hias. And he was numbered
with the eleven apostles.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2

1 When the Day of Pentecost had
fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place.
2 And suddenly there came a sound
from heaven, as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it ﬁlled the whole house
where they were si ng.
3 Then there appeared to them divided
tongues, as of ﬁre, and one sat upon
each of them.
4 And they were all ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
u erance.
5 And there were dwelling in Jerusalem
Jews, devout men, from every na on
under heaven.
6 And when this sound occurred, the
mul tude came together, and were
confused, because everyone heard them
speak in his own language.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
7
7 Then they were all amazed and
marveled, saying to one another, "Look,
are not all these who speak Galileans?
8 "And how is it that we hear, each in
our own language in which we were
born?
9 "Parthians and Medes and Elamites,
those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea
and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
10 "Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and
the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene,
visitors from Rome, both Jews and
proselytes,
11 "Cretans and Arabs––we hear them
speaking in our own tongues the
wonderful works of God."
12 So they were all amazed and
perplexed, saying to one another,
"Whatever could this mean?"
13 Others mocking said, "They are full
of new wine."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
8
14 But Peter, standing up with the
eleven, raised his voice and said to them,
"Men of Judea and all who dwell in
Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and
heed my words.
15 "For these are not drunk, as you
suppose, since it is only the third hour of
the day.
16 "But this is what was spoken by the
prophet Joel:
17 ‘And it shall come to pass in the last
days, says God, That I will pour out of
My Spirit on all ﬂesh; Your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy, Your young
men shall see visions, Your old men shall
dream dreams.
18 And on My menservants and on My
maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in
those days; And they shall prophesy.
19 I will show wonders in heaven above
And signs in the earth beneath: Blood
and ﬁre and vapor of smoke.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
9
20 The sun shall be turned into darkness,
And the moon into blood, Before the
coming of the great and awesome day of
the LORD.
21 And it shall come to pass That
whoever calls on the name of the LORD
Shall be saved.’
22 "Men of Israel, hear these words:
Jesus of Nazareth, a Man a ested by
God to you by miracles, wonders, and
signs which God did through Him in your
midst, as you yourselves also know––
23 "Him, being delivered by the
determined purpose and foreknowledge
of God, you have taken by lawless hands,
have cruciﬁed, and put to death;
24 "whom God raised up, having loosed
the pains of death, because it was not
possible that He should be held by it.
25 "For David says concerning Him: ‘I
foresaw the LORD always before myACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
10
face, For He is at my right hand, that I
may not be shaken.
26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my
tongue was glad; Moreover my ﬂesh also
will rest in hope.
27 For You will not leave my soul in
Hades, Nor will You allow Your Holy One
to see corrup on.
28 You have made known to me the
ways of life; You will make me full of joy
in Your presence.’
29 "Men and brethren, let me speak
freely to you of the patriarch David, that
he is both dead and buried, and his tomb
is with us to this day.
30 "Therefore, being a prophet, and
knowing that God had sworn with an
oath to him that of the fruit of his body,
according to the ﬂesh, He would raise up
the Christ to sit on his throne,
31 "he, foreseeing this, spoke
concerning the resurrec on of theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
11
Christ, that His soul was not le in
Hades, nor did His ﬂesh see corrup on.
32 "This Jesus God has raised up, of
which we are all witnesses.
33 "Therefore being exalted to the right
hand of God, and having received from
the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit,
He poured out this which you now see
and hear.
34 "For David did not ascend into the
heavens, but he says himself: ‘The LORD
said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,
35 Till I make Your enemies Your
footstool."’
36 "Therefore let all the house of Israel
know assuredly that God has made this
Jesus, whom you cruciﬁed, both Lord
and Christ."
37 Now when they heard this, they
were cut to the heart, and said to Peter
and the rest of the apostles, "Men and
brethren, what shall we do?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
12
38 Then Peter said to them, "Repent,
and let every one of you be bap zed
in the name of Jesus Christ for the
remission of sins; and you shall receive
the gi of the Holy Spirit.
39 "For the promise is to you and to
your children, and to all who are afar oﬀ,
as many as the Lord our God will call."
40 And with many other words he
tes ﬁed and exhorted them, saying, "Be
saved from this perverse genera on."
41 Then those who gladly received his
word were bap zed; and that day about
three thousand souls were added to
them.
42 And they con nued steadfastly in the
apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the
breaking of bread, and in prayers.
43 Then fear came upon every soul,
and many wonders and signs were done
through the apostles.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2 – 3
13
44 Now all who believed were together,
and had all things in common,
45 and sold their possessions and goods,
and divided them among all, as anyone
had need.
46 So con nuing daily with one accord
in the temple, and breaking bread from
house to house, they ate their food with
gladness and simplicity of heart,
47 praising God and having favor with
all the people. And the Lord added to
the church daily those who were being
saved.
1 Now Peter and John went up
together to the temple at the hour
of prayer, the ninth hour.
2 And a certain man lame from his
mother’s womb was carried, whom they
laid daily at the gate of the temple which
is called Beau ful, to ask alms from
those who entered the temple;
3ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
14
3 who, seeing Peter and John about to
go into the temple, asked for alms.
4 And ﬁxing his eyes on him, with John,
Peter said, "Look at us."
5 So he gave them his a en on,
expec ng to receive something from
them.
6 Then Peter said, "Silver and gold I do
not have, but what I do have I give you:
In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
rise up and walk."
7 And he took him by the right hand
and li ed him up, and immediately his
feet and ankle bones received strength.
8 So he, leaping up, stood and
walked and entered the temple with
them––walking, leaping, and praising
God.
9 And all the people saw him walking
and praising God.
10 Then they knew that it was he who
sat begging alms at the Beau ful GateACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
15
of the temple; and they were ﬁlled with
wonder and amazement at what had
happened to him.
11 Now as the lame man who was
healed held on to Peter and John, all
the people ran together to them in the
porch which is called Solomon’s, greatly
amazed.
12 So when Peter saw it, he responded
to the people: "Men of Israel, why do
you marvel at this? Or why look so
intently at us, as though by our own
power or godliness we had made this
man walk?
13 "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, the God of our fathers, gloriﬁed
His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered
up and denied in the presence of Pilate,
when he was determined to let Him go.
14 "But you denied the Holy One and
the Just, and asked for a murderer to be
granted to you,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
16
15 "and killed the Prince of life, whom
God raised from the dead, of which we
are witnesses.
16 "And His name, through faith in His
name, has made this man strong, whom
you see and know. Yes, the faith which
comes through Him has given him this
perfect soundness in the presence of
you all.
17 "Yet now, brethren, I know that you
did it in ignorance, as did also your
rulers.
18 "But those things which God foretold
by the mouth of all His prophets, that
the Christ would suﬀer, He has thus
fulﬁlled.
19 "Repent therefore and be converted,
that your sins may be blo ed out, so
that mes of refreshing may come from
the presence of the Lord,
20 "and that He may send Jesus Christ,
who was preached to you before,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
21 "whom heaven must receive un
17
l the
mes of restora on of all things, which
God has spoken by the mouth of all His
holy prophets since the world began.
22 "For Moses truly said to the fathers,
‘The LORD your God will raise up for you
a Prophet like me from your brethren.
Him you shall hear in all things, whatever
He says to you.
23 ‘And it shall be that every soul who
will not hear that Prophet shall be u erly
destroyed from among the people.’
24 "Yes, and all the prophets, from
Samuel and those who follow, as many
as have spoken, have also foretold these
days.
25 "You are sons of the prophets, and of
the covenant which God made with our
fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your
seed all the families of the earth shall be
blessed.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3 – 4
18
26 "To you ﬁrst, God, having raised up
His Servant Jesus, sent Him to bless you,
in turning away every one of you from
your iniqui es."
1 Now as they spoke to the people,
the priests, the captain of the
temple, and the Sadducees came upon
them,
2 being greatly disturbed that they
taught the people and preached in Jesus
the resurrec on from the dead.
3 And they laid hands on them, and put
them in custody un l the next day, for it
was already evening.
4 However, many of those who heard
the word believed; and the number of
the men came to be about ﬁve thousand.
5 And it came to pass, on the next day,
that their rulers, elders, and scribes,
6 as well as Annas the high priest,
Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and
as many as were of the family of the
4ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
19
high priest, were gathered together at
Jerusalem.
7 And when they had set them in the
midst, they asked, "By what power or by
what name have you done this?"
8 Then Peter, ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit,
said to them, "Rulers of the people and
elders of Israel:
9 "If we this day are judged for a good
deed done to a helpless man, by what
means he has been made well,
10 "let it be known to you all, and to all
the people of Israel, that by the name
of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you
cruciﬁed, whom God raised from the
dead, by Him this man stands here
before you whole.
11 "This is the ‘stone which was rejected
by you builders, which has become the
chief cornerstone.’
12 "Nor is there salva on in any other,
for there is no other name under heavenACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
20
given among men by which we must be
saved."
13 Now when they saw the boldness of
Peter and John, and perceived that they
were uneducated and untrained men,
they marveled. And they realized that
they had been with Jesus.
14 And seeing the man who had been
healed standing with them, they could
say nothing against it.
15 But when they had commanded
them to go aside out of the council, they
conferred among themselves,
16 saying, "What shall we do to these
men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle
has been done through them is evident
to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we
cannot deny it.
17 "But so that it spreads no further
among the people, let us severely
threaten them, that from now on they
speak to no man in this name."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
21
18 And they called them and
commanded them not to speak at
all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
19 But Peter and John answered and
said to them, "Whether it is right in the
sight of God to listen to you more than
to God, you judge.
20 "For we cannot but speak the things
which we have seen and heard."
21 So when they had further threatened
them, they let them go, ﬁnding no way of
punishing them, because of the people,
since they all gloriﬁed God for what had
been done.
22 For the man was over forty years old
on whom this miracle of healing had
been performed.
23 And being let go, they went to their
own companions and reported all that
the chief priests and elders had said to
them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
22
24 So when they heard that, they raised
their voice to God with one accord and
said: "Lord, You are God, who made
heaven and earth and the sea, and all
that is in them,
25 "who by the mouth of Your servant
David have said: ‘Why did the na ons
rage, And the people plot vain things?
26 The kings of the earth took their
stand, And the rulers were gathered
together Against the LORD and against
His Christ.’
27 "For truly against Your holy Servant
Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod
and Pon us Pilate, with the Gen les
and the people of Israel, were gathered
together
28 "to do whatever Your hand and Your
purpose determined before to be done.
29 "Now, Lord, look on their threats,
and grant to Your servants that with all
boldness they may speak Your word,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
23
30 "by stretching out Your hand to heal,
and that signs and wonders may be done
through the name of Your holy Servant
Jesus."
31 And when they had prayed, the place
where they were assembled together
was shaken; and they were all ﬁlled with
the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word
of God with boldness.
32 Now the mul tude of those who
believed were of one heart and one soul;
neither did anyone say that any of the
things he possessed was his own, but
they had all things in common.
33 And with great power the apostles
gave witness to the resurrec on of the
Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon
them all.
34 Nor was there anyone among them
who lacked; for all who were possessors
of lands or houses sold them, andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4 – 5
24
brought the proceeds of the things that
were sold,
35 and laid them at the apostles’ feet;
and they distributed to each as anyone
had need.
36 And Joses, who was also named
Barnabas by the apostles (which is
translated Son of Encouragement), a
Levite of the country of Cyprus,
37 having land, sold it, and brought the
money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
1 But a certain man named Ananias,
with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession.
2 And he kept back part of the
proceeds, his wife also being aware of it,
and brought a certain part and laid it at
the apostles’ feet.
3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has
Satan ﬁlled your heart to lie to the Holy
Spirit and keep back part of the price of
the land for yourself?
5ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
25
4 "While it remained, was it not your
own? And a er it was sold, was it not
in your own control? Why have you
conceived this thing in your heart? You
have not lied to men but to God."
5 Then Ananias, hearing these words,
fell down and breathed his last. So great
fear came upon all those who heard
these things.
6 And the young men arose and
wrapped him up, carried him out, and
buried him.
7 Now it was about three hours later
when his wife came in, not knowing
what had happened.
8 And Peter answered her, "Tell me
whether you sold the land for so much?"
She said, "Yes, for so much."
9 Then Peter said to her, "How is it that
you have agreed together to test the
Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of thoseACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
26
who have buried your husband are at
the door, and they will carry you out."
10 Then immediately she fell down at
his feet and breathed her last. And the
young men came in and found her dead,
and carrying her out, buried her by her
husband.
11 So great fear came upon all the
church and upon all who heard these
things.
12 And through the hands of the
apostles many signs and wonders were
done among the people. And they were
all with one accord in Solomon’s Porch.
13 Yet none of the rest dared join them,
but the people esteemed them highly.
14 And believers were increasingly
added to the Lord, mul tudes of both
men and women,
15 so that they brought the sick out into
the streets and laid them on beds and
couches, that at least the shadow ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
27
Peter passing by might fall on some of
them.
16 Also a mul tude gathered from
the surrounding ci es to Jerusalem,
bringing sick people and those who were
tormented by unclean spirits, and they
were all healed.
17 Then the high priest rose up, and all
those who were with him (which is the
sect of the Sadducees), and they were
ﬁlled with indigna on,
18 and laid their hands on the apostles
and put them in the common prison.
19 But at night an angel of the Lord
opened the prison doors and brought
them out, and said,
20 "Go, stand in the temple and speak
to the people all the words of this life."
21 And when they heard that, they
entered the temple early in the morning
and taught. But the high priest and
those with him came and called theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
28
council together, with all the elders of
the children of Israel, and sent to the
prison to have them brought.
22 But when the oﬃcers came and
did not ﬁnd them in the prison, they
returned and reported,
23 saying, "Indeed we found the prison
shut securely, and the guards standing
outside before the doors; but when we
opened them, we found no one inside!"
24 Now when the high priest, the
captain of the temple, and the chief
priests heard these things, they
wondered what the outcome would be.
25 So one came and told them, saying,
"Look, the men whom you put in prison
are standing in the temple and teaching
the people!"
26 Then the captain went with the
oﬃcers and brought them without
violence, for they feared the people, lest
they should be stoned.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
29
27 And when they had brought them,
they set them before the council. And
the high priest asked them,
28 saying, "Did we not strictly command
you not to teach in this name? And look,
you have ﬁlled Jerusalem with your
doctrine, and intend to bring this Man’s
blood on us!"
29 But Peter and the other apostles
answered and said: "We ought to obey
God rather than men.
30 "The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus whom you murdered by hanging
on a tree.
31 "Him God has exalted to His right
hand to be Prince and Savior, to give
repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
sins.
32 "And we are His witnesses to these
things, and so also is the Holy Spirit
whom God has given to those who obey
Him."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
30
33 When they heard this, they were
furious and plo ed to kill them.
34 Then one in the council stood up,
a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher
of the law held in respect by all the
people, and commanded them to put
the apostles outside for a li le while.
35 And he said to them: "Men of Israel,
take heed to yourselves what you intend
to do regarding these men.
36 "For some me ago Theudas rose up,
claiming to be somebody. A number of
men, about four hundred, joined him.
He was slain, and all who obeyed him
were sca ered and came to nothing.
37 "A er this man, Judas of Galilee rose
up in the days of the census, and drew
away many people a er him. He also
perished, and all who obeyed him were
dispersed.
38 "And now I say to you, keep away
from these men and let them alone; forACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5 – 6
31
if this plan or this work is of men, it will
come to nothing;
39 "but if it is of God, you cannot
overthrow it––lest you even be found to
ﬁght against God."
40 And they agreed with him, and when
they had called for the apostles and
beaten them, they commanded that
they should not speak in the name of
Jesus, and let them go.
41 So they departed from the presence
of the council, rejoicing that they were
counted worthy to suﬀer shame for His
name.
42 And daily in the temple, and in every
house, they did not cease teaching and
preaching Jesus as the Christ.
1 Now in those days, when the
number of the disciples was
mul plying, there arose a complaint
against the Hebrews by the Hellenists,
6ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
32
because their widows were neglected in
the daily distribu on.
2 Then the twelve summoned the
mul tude of the disciples and said, "It is
not desirable that we should leave the
word of God and serve tables.
3 "Therefore, brethren, seek out
from among you seven men of good
reputa on, full of the Holy Spirit and
wisdom, whom we may appoint over
this business;
4 "but we will give ourselves con nually
to prayer and to the ministry of the
word."
5 And the saying pleased the whole
mul tude. And they chose Stephen, a
man full of faith and the Holy Spirit,
and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon,
Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from
An och,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
33
6 whom they set before the apostles;
and when they had prayed, they laid
hands on them.
7 Then the word of God spread, and
the number of the disciples mul plied
greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many
of the priests were obedient to the faith.
8 And Stephen, full of faith and power,
did great wonders and signs among the
people.
9 Then there arose some from what is
called the Synagogue of the Freedmen
(Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those
from Cilicia and Asia), dispu ng with
Stephen.
10 And they were not able to resist
the wisdom and the Spirit by which he
spoke.
11 Then they secretly induced men
to say, "We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses and
God."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6 – 7
12 And they s
34
rred up the people, the
elders, and the scribes; and they came
upon him, seized him, and brought him
to the council.
13 They also set up false witnesses who
said, "This man does not cease to speak
blasphemous words against this holy
place and the law;
14 "for we have heard him say that this
Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place
and change the customs which Moses
delivered to us."
15 And all who sat in the council, looking
steadfastly at him, saw his face as the
face of an angel.
1 Then the high priest said, "Are
these things so?"
2 And he said, "Brethren and fathers,
listen: The God of glory appeared to
our father Abraham when he was in
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
7ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
35
3 "and said to him, ‘Get out of your
country and from your rela ves, and
come to a land that I will show you.’
4 "Then he came out of the land of
the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And
from there, when his father was dead,
He moved him to this land in which you
now dwell.
5 "And God gave him no inheritance
in it, not even enough to set his foot
on. But even when Abraham had no
child, He promised to give it to him for a
possession, and to his descendants a er
him.
6 "But God spoke in this way: that his
descendants would dwell in a foreign
land, and that they would bring them
into bondage and oppress them four
hundred years.
7 ‘And the na on to whom they will be
in bondage I will judge,’ said God, ‘andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
36
a er that they shall come out and serve
Me in this place.’
8 "Then He gave him the covenant of
circumcision; and so Abraham begot
Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth
day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob
begot the twelve patriarchs.
9 "And the patriarchs, becoming
envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God
was with him
10 "and delivered him out of all his
troubles, and gave him favor and wisdom
in the presence of Pharaoh, king of
Egypt; and he made him governor over
Egypt and all his house.
11 "Now a famine and great trouble
came over all the land of Egypt and
Canaan, and our fathers found no
sustenance.
12 "But when Jacob heard that there
was grain in Egypt, he sent out our
fathers ﬁrst.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
13 "And the second
37
me Joseph was
made known to his brothers, and
Joseph’s family became known to the
Pharaoh.
14 "Then Joseph sent and called his
father Jacob and all his rela ves to him,
seventy–ﬁve people.
15 "So Jacob went down to Egypt; and
he died, he and our fathers.
16 "And they were carried back to
Shechem and laid in the tomb that
Abraham bought for a sum of money
from the sons of Hamor, the father of
Shechem.
17 "But when the me of the promise
drew near which God had sworn
to Abraham, the people grew and
mul plied in Egypt
18 " ll another king arose who did not
know Joseph.
19 "This man dealt treacherously
with our people, and oppressed ourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
38
forefathers, making them expose their
babies, so that they might not live.
20 "At this me Moses was born, and
was well pleasing to God; and he was
brought up in his father’s house for three
months.
21 "But when he was set out, Pharaoh’s
daughter took him away and brought
him up as her own son.
22 "And Moses was learned in all the
wisdom of the Egyp ans, and was
mighty in words and deeds.
23 "Now when he was forty years old, it
came into his heart to visit his brethren,
the children of Israel.
24 "And seeing one of them suﬀer
wrong, he defended and avenged him
who was oppressed, and struck down
the Egyp an.
25 "For he supposed that his brethren
would have understood that God wouldACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
39
deliver them by his hand, but they did
not understand.
26 "And the next day he appeared to
two of them as they were ﬁgh ng, and
tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men,
you are brethren; why do you wrong one
another?’
27 "But he who did his neighbor wrong
pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made
you a ruler and a judge over us?
28 ‘Do you want to kill me as you did the
Egyp an yesterday?’
29 "Then, at this saying, Moses ﬂed and
became a dweller in the land of Midian,
where he had two sons.
30 "And when forty years had passed, an
Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
ﬂame of ﬁre in a bush, in the wilderness
of Mount Sinai.
31 "When Moses saw it, he marveled
at the sight; and as he drew near toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
40
observe, the voice of the Lord came to
him,
32 "saying, ‘I am the God of your

of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ And
Moses trembled and dared not look.
33 ‘Then the LORD said to him, "Take
your sandals oﬀ your feet, for the place
where you stand is holy ground.
34 "I have surely seen the oppression
of my people who are in Egypt; I have
heard their groaning and have come
down to deliver them. And now come, I
will send you to Egypt."’
35 "This Moses whom they rejected,
saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a
judge?’ is the one God sent to be a ruler
and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel
who appeared to him in the bush.
36 "He brought them out, a er he had
shown wonders and signs in the land ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
41
Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the
wilderness forty years.
37 "This is that Moses who said to the
children of Israel, ‘The LORD your God
will raise up for you a Prophet like me
from your brethren. Him you shall hear.’
38 "This is he who was in the
congrega on in the wilderness with
the Angel who spoke to him on Mount
Sinai, and with our fathers, the one who
received the living oracles to give to us,
39 "whom our fathers would not obey,
but rejected. And in their hearts they
turned back to Egypt,
40 "saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods to go
before us; as for this Moses who brought
us out of the land of Egypt, we do not
know what has become of him.’
41 "And they made a calf in those
days, oﬀered sacriﬁces to the idol, and
rejoiced in the works of their own hands.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
42
42 "Then God turned and gave them
up to worship the host of heaven, as it
is wri en in the book of the Prophets:
‘Did you oﬀer Me slaughtered animals
and sacriﬁces during forty years in the
wilderness, O house of Israel?
43 You also took up the tabernacle
of Moloch, And the star of your god
Remphan, Images which you made
to worship; And I will carry you away
beyond Babylon.’
44 "Our fathers had the tabernacle
of witness in the wilderness, as He
appointed, instruc ng Moses to make
it according to the pa ern that he had
seen,
45 "which our fathers, having received
it in turn, also brought with Joshua into
the land possessed by the Gen les,
whom God drove out before the face of
our fathers un l the days of David,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
43
46 "who found favor before God and
asked to ﬁnd a dwelling for the God of
Jacob.
47 "But Solomon built Him a house.
48 "However, the Most High does not
dwell in temples made with hands, as
the prophet says:
49 ‘Heaven is My throne, And earth is
My footstool. What house will you build
for Me? says the LORD, Or what is the
place of My rest?
50 Has My hand not made all these
things?’
51 "You s ﬀnecked and uncircumcised
in heart and ears! You always resist the
Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do
you.
52 "Which of the prophets did your
fathers not persecute? And they killed
those who foretold the coming of
the Just One, of whom you now have
become the betrayers and murderers,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
44
53 "who have received the law by the
direc on of angels and have not kept it."
54 When they heard these things they
were cut to the heart, and they gnashed
at him with their teeth.
55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit,
gazed into heaven and saw the glory
of God, and Jesus standing at the right
hand of God,
56 and said, "Look! I see the heavens
opened and the Son of Man standing at
the right hand of God!"
57 Then they cried out with a loud voice,
stopped their ears, and ran at him with
one accord;
58 and they cast him out of the city
and stoned him. And the witnesses laid
down their clothes at the feet of a young
man named Saul.
59 And they stoned Stephen as he was
calling on God and saying, "Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7 – 8
45
60 Then he knelt down and cried out
with a loud voice, "Lord, do not charge
them with this sin." And when he had
said this, he fell asleep.
1 Now Saul was consen ng to
his death. At that me a great
persecu on arose against the church
which was at Jerusalem; and they were
all sca ered throughout the regions of
Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
2 And devout men carried Stephen to
his burial, and made great lamenta on
over him.
3 As for Saul, he made havoc of
the church, entering every house,
and dragging oﬀ men and women,
commi ng them to prison.
4 Therefore those who were sca ered
went everywhere preaching the word.
5 Then Philip went down to the city of
Samaria and preached Christ to them.
8ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
6 And the mul
46
tudes with one accord
heeded the things spoken by Philip,
hearing and seeing the miracles which
he did.
7 For unclean spirits, crying with a
loud voice, came out of many who
were possessed; and many who were
paralyzed and lame were healed.
8 And there was great joy in that city.
9 But there was a certain man called
Simon, who previously prac ced sorcery
in the city and astonished the people of
Samaria, claiming that he was someone
great,
10 to whom they all gave heed, from the
least to the greatest, saying, "This man is
the great power of God."
11 And they heeded him because he
had astonished them with his sorceries
for a long me.
12 But when they believed Philip as
he preached the things concerning theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
47
kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
Christ, both men and women were
bap zed.
13 Then Simon himself also believed;
and when he was bap zed he con nued
with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the
miracles and signs which were done.
14 Now when the apostles who were
at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
received the word of God, they sent
Peter and John to them,
15 who, when they had come down,
prayed for them that they might receive
the Holy Spirit.
16 For as yet He had fallen upon none of
them. They had only been bap zed in
the name of the Lord Jesus.
17 Then they laid hands on them, and
they received the Holy Spirit.
18 And when Simon saw that through
the laying on of the apostles’ hands theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
48
Holy Spirit was given, he oﬀered them
money,
19 saying, "Give me this power also,
that anyone on whom I lay hands may
receive the Holy Spirit."
20 But Peter said to him, "Your money
perish with you, because you thought
that the gi of God could be purchased
with money!
21 "You have neither part nor por on in
this ma er, for your heart is not right in
the sight of God.
22 "Repent therefore of this your
wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the
thought of your heart may be forgiven
you.
23 "For I see that you are poisoned by
bi erness and bound by iniquity."
24 Then Simon answered and said, "Pray
to the Lord for me, that none of the
things which you have spoken may come
upon me."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
25 So when they had tes
49
ﬁed and
preached the word of the Lord, they
returned to Jerusalem, preaching
the gospel in many villages of the
Samaritans.
26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to
Philip, saying, "Arise and go toward the
south along the road which goes down
from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is desert.
27 So he arose and went. And behold,
a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great
authority under Candace the queen of
the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her
treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to
worship,
28 was returning. And si ng in his
chariot, he was reading Isaiah the
prophet.
29 Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go
near and overtake this chariot."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
50
30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him
reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, "Do
you understand what you are reading?"
31 And he said, "How can I, unless
someone guides me?" And he asked
Philip to come up and sit with him.
32 The place in the Scripture which he
read was this: "He was led as a sheep to
the slaughter; And as a lamb before its
shearer is silent, So He opened not His
mouth.
33 In His humilia on His jus ce was
taken away, And who will declare His
genera on? For His life is taken from the
earth."
34 So the eunuch answered Philip and
said, "I ask you, of whom does the
prophet say this, of himself or of some
other man?"
35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and
beginning at this Scripture, preached
Jesus to him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8 – 9
51
36 Now as they went down the road,
they came to some water. And the
eunuch said, "See, here is water. What
hinders me from being bap zed?"
37 Then Philip said, "If you believe
with all your heart, you may." And he
answered and said, "I believe that Jesus
Christ is the Son of God."
38 So he commanded the chariot to
stand s ll. And both Philip and the
eunuch went down into the water, and
he bap zed him.
39 Now when they came up out of the
water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip
away, so that the eunuch saw him no
more; and he went on his way rejoicing.
40 But Philip was found at Azotus. And
passing through, he preached in all the
ci es ll he came to Caesarea.
1 Then Saul, s ll breathing threats
and murder against the disciples of
the Lord, went to the high priest
9ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
2 and asked le
52
ers from him to the
synagogues of Damascus, so that if
he found any who were of the Way,
whether men or women, he might bring
them bound to Jerusalem.
3 As he journeyed he came near
Damascus, and suddenly a light shone
around him from heaven.
4 Then he fell to the ground, and heard
a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why
are you persecu ng Me?"
5 And he said, "Who are You, Lord?"
Then the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom
you are persecu ng. It is hard for you to
kick against the goads."
6 So he, trembling and astonished, said,
"Lord, what do You want me to do?"
Then the Lord said to him, "Arise and go
into the city, and you will be told what
you must do."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
53
7 And the men who journeyed with him
stood speechless, hearing a voice but
seeing no one.
8 Then Saul arose from the ground, and
when his eyes were opened he saw no
one. But they led him by the hand and
brought him into Damascus.
9 And he was three days without sight,
and neither ate nor drank.
10 Now there was a certain disciple at
Damascus named Ananias; and to him
the Lord said in a vision, "Ananias." And
he said, "Here I am, Lord."
11 So the Lord said to him, "Arise and go
to the street called Straight, and inquire
at the house of Judas for one called Saul
of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.
12 "And in a vision he has seen a man
named Ananias coming in and pu ng
his hand on him, so that he might receive
his sight."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
54
13 Then Ananias answered, "Lord, I have
heard from many about this man, how
much harm he has done to Your saints in
Jerusalem.
14 "And here he has authority from the
chief priests to bind all who call on Your
name."
15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he
is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My
name before Gen les, kings, and the
children of Israel.
16 "For I will show him how many things
he must suﬀer for My name’s sake."
17 And Ananias went his way and
entered the house; and laying his hands
on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord
Jesus, who appeared to you on the road
as you came, has sent me that you may
receive your sight and be ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit."
18 Immediately there fell from his eyes
something like scales, and he receivedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
55
his sight at once; and he arose and was
bap zed.
19 So when he had received food, he
was strengthened. Then Saul spent some
days with the disciples at Damascus.
20 Immediately he preached the Christ
in the synagogues, that He is the Son of
God.
21 Then all who heard were amazed,
and said, "Is this not he who destroyed
those who called on this name in
Jerusalem, and has come here for that
purpose, so that he might bring them
bound to the chief priests?"
22 But Saul increased all the more in
strength, and confounded the Jews who
dwelt in Damascus, proving that this
Jesus is the Christ.
23 Now a er many days were past, the
Jews plo ed to kill him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
56
24 But their plot became known to Saul.
And they watched the gates day and
night, to kill him.
25 Then the disciples took him by night
and let him down through the wall in a
large basket.
26 And when Saul had come to
Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples;
but they were all afraid of him, and did
not believe that he was a disciple.
27 But Barnabas took him and brought
him to the apostles. And he declared
to them how he had seen the Lord on
the road, and that He had spoken to
him, and how he had preached boldly at
Damascus in the name of Jesus.
28 So he was with them at Jerusalem,
coming in and going out.
29 And he spoke boldly in the name of
the Lord Jesus and disputed against the
Hellenists, but they a empted to kill
him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
57
30 When the brethren found out, they
brought him down to Caesarea and sent
him out to Tarsus.
31 Then the churches throughout all
Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace
and were ediﬁed. And walking in the
fear of the Lord and in the comfort of
the Holy Spirit, they were mul plied.
32 Now it came to pass, as Peter went
through all parts of the country, that he
also came down to the saints who dwelt
in Lydda.
33 There he found a certain man named
Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight
years and was paralyzed.
34 And Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus
the Christ heals you. Arise and make
your bed." Then he arose immediately.
35 So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon
saw him and turned to the Lord.
36 At Joppa there was a certain disciple
named Tabitha, which is translatedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
58
Dorcas. This woman was full of good
works and charitable deeds which she
did.
37 But it happened in those days that
she became sick and died. When they
had washed her, they laid her in an
upper room.
38 And since Lydda was near Joppa,
and the disciples had heard that Peter
was there, they sent two men to him,
imploring him not to delay in coming to
them.
39 Then Peter arose and went with
them. When he had come, they brought
him to the upper room. And all the
widows stood by him weeping, showing
the tunics and garments which Dorcas
had made while she was with them.
40 But Peter put them all out, and knelt
down and prayed. And turning to the
body he said, "Tabitha, arise." And sheACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9 – 10
59
opened her eyes, and when she saw
Peter she sat up.
41 Then he gave her his hand and li ed
her up; and when he had called the
saints and widows, he presented her
alive.
42 And it became known throughout all
Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
43 So it was that he stayed many days in
Joppa with Simon, a tanner.
1 There was a certain man in
Caesarea called Cornelius, a
centurion of what was called the Italian
Regiment,
2 a devout man and one who feared
God with all his household, who gave
alms generously to the people, and
prayed to God always.
3 About the ninth hour of the day he
saw clearly in a vision an angel of God
coming in and saying to him, "Cornelius!"
10ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
60
4 And when he observed him, he was
afraid, and said, "What is it, lord?" So he
said to him, "Your prayers and your alms
have come up for a memorial before
God.
5 "Now send men to Joppa, and send
for Simon whose surname is Peter.
6 "He is lodging with Simon, a tanner,
whose house is by the sea. He will tell
you what you must do."
7 And when the angel who spoke to him
had departed, Cornelius called two of his
household servants and a devout soldier
from among those who waited on him
con nually.
8 So when he had explained all these
things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
9 The next day, as they went on their
journey and drew near the city, Peter
went up on the housetop to pray, about
the sixth hour.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
61
10 Then he became very hungry and
wanted to eat; but while they made
ready, he fell into a trance
11 and saw heaven opened and an
object like a great sheet bound at the
four corners, descending to him and let
down to the earth.
12 In it were all kinds of four–footed
animals of the earth, wild beasts,
creeping things, and birds of the air.
13 And a voice came to him, "Rise,
Peter; kill and eat."
14 But Peter said, "Not so, Lord! For I
have never eaten anything common or
unclean."
15 And a voice spoke to him again the
second me, "What God has cleansed
you must not call common."
16 This was done three mes. And the
object was taken up into heaven again.
17 Now while Peter wondered within
himself what this vision which he hadACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
62
seen meant, behold, the men who had
been sent from Cornelius had made
inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood
before the gate.
18 And they called and asked whether
Simon, whose surname was Peter, was
lodging there.
19 While Peter thought about the vision,
the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three
men are seeking you.
20 "Arise therefore, go down and go
with them, doub ng nothing; for I have
sent them."
21 Then Peter went down to the
men who had been sent to him from
Cornelius, and said, "Yes, I am he whom
you seek. For what reason have you
come?"
22 And they said, "Cornelius the
centurion, a just man, one who fears
God and has a good reputa on among
all the na on of the Jews, was divinelyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
63
instructed by a holy angel to summon
you to his house, and to hear words from
you."
23 Then he invited them in and lodged
them. On the next day Peter went away
with them, and some brethren from
Joppa accompanied him.
24 And the following day they entered
Caesarea. Now Cornelius was wai ng
for them, and had called together his
rela ves and close friends.
25 As Peter was coming in, Cornelius
met him and fell down at his feet and
worshiped him.
26 But Peter li ed him up, saying,
"Stand up; I myself am also a man."
27 And as he talked with him, he went in
and found many who had come together.
28 Then he said to them, "You know
how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to
keep company with or go to one of
another na on. But God has shown meACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
64
that I should not call any man common
or unclean.
29 "Therefore I came without objec on
as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for
what reason have you sent for me?"
30 So Cornelius said, "Four days ago I
was fas ng un l this hour; and at the
ninth hour I prayed in my house, and
behold, a man stood before me in bright
clothing,
31 "and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer
has been heard, and your alms are
remembered in the sight of God.
32 ‘Send therefore to Joppa and call
Simon here, whose surname is Peter.
He is lodging in the house of Simon, a
tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he
will speak to you.’
33 "So I sent to you immediately, and
you have done well to come. Now
therefore, we are all present before God,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
65
to hear all the things commanded you
by God."
34 Then Peter opened his mouth and
said: "In truth I perceive that God shows
no par ality.
35 "But in every na on whoever fears
Him and works righteousness is accepted
by Him.
36 "The word which God sent to the
children of Israel, preaching peace
through Jesus Christ––He is Lord of all––
37 "that word you know, which was
proclaimed throughout all Judea, and
began from Galilee a er the bap sm
which John preached:
38 "how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Spirit and with power, who
went about doing good and healing all
who were oppressed by the devil, for
God was with Him.
39 "And we are witnesses of all things
which He did both in the land of theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
66
Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed
by hanging on a tree.
40 "Him God raised up on the third day,
and showed Him openly,
41 "not to all the people, but to
witnesses chosen before by God, even
to us who ate and drank with Him a er
He arose from the dead.
42 "And He commanded us to preach
to the people, and to tes fy that it is He
who was ordained by God to be Judge of
the living and the dead.
43 "To Him all the prophets witness that,
through His name, whoever believes in
Him will receive remission of sins."
44 While Peter was s ll speaking these
words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those
who heard the word.
45 And those of the circumcision who
believed were astonished, as many as
came with Peter, because the gi of theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10 – 11 67
Holy Spirit had been poured out on the
Gen les also.
46 For they heard them speak with
tongues and magnify God. Then Peter
answered,
47 "Can anyone forbid water, that
these should not be bap zed who have
received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
48 And he commanded them to be
bap zed in the name of the Lord. Then
they asked him to stay a few days.
1 Now the apostles and brethren
who were in Judea heard that the
Gen les had also received the word of
God.
2 And when Peter came up to Jerusalem,
those of the circumcision contended
with him,
3 saying, "You went in to uncircumcised
men and ate with them!"
4 But Peter explained it to them in order
from the beginning, saying:
11ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
68
5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying;
and in a trance I saw a vision, an object
descending like a great sheet, let down
from heaven by four corners; and it
came to me.
6 "When I observed it intently and
considered, I saw four–footed animals of
the earth, wild beasts, creeping things,
and birds of the air.
7 "And I heard a voice saying to me,
‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’
8 "But I said, ‘Not so, Lord! For nothing
common or unclean has at any me
entered my mouth.’
9 "But the voice answered me again
from heaven, ‘What God has cleansed
you must not call common.’
10 "Now this was done three mes, and
all were drawn up again into heaven.
11 "At that very moment, three men
stood before the house where I was,
having been sent to me from Caesarea.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
69
12 "Then the Spirit told me to go with
them, doub ng nothing. Moreover
these six brethren accompanied me, and
we entered the man’s house.
13 "And he told us how he had seen an
angel standing in his house, who said to
him, ‘Send men to Joppa, and call for
Simon whose surname is Peter,
14 ‘who will tell you words by which you
and all your household will be saved.’
15 "And as I began to speak, the Holy
Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the
beginning.
16 "Then I remembered the word of the
Lord, how He said, ‘John indeed bap zed
with water, but you shall be bap zed
with the Holy Spirit.’
17 "If therefore God gave them the same
gi as He gave us when we believed on
the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I
could withstand God?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
70
18 When they heard these things they
became silent; and they gloriﬁed God,
saying, "Then God has also granted to
the Gen les repentance to life."
19 Now those who were sca ered a er
the persecu on that arose over Stephen
traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and
An och, preaching the word to no one
but the Jews only.
20 But some of them were men from
Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had
come to An och, spoke to the Hellenists,
preaching the Lord Jesus.
21 And the hand of the Lord was with
them, and a great number believed and
turned to the Lord.
22 Then news of these things came to
the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and
they sent out Barnabas to go as far as
An och.
23 When he came and had seen
the grace of God, he was glad, andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
71
encouraged them all that with purpose
of heart they should con nue with the
Lord.
24 For he was a good man, full of the
Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many
people were added to the Lord.
25 Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus
to seek Saul.
26 And when he had found him, he
brought him to An och. So it was that
for a whole year they assembled with
the church and taught a great many
people. And the disciples were ﬁrst
called Chris ans in An och.
27 And in these days prophets came
from Jerusalem to An och.
28 Then one of them, named Agabus,
stood up and showed by the Spirit that
there was going to be a great famine
throughout all the world, which also
happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11 – 12 72
29 Then the disciples, each according to
his ability, determined to send relief to
the brethren dwelling in Judea.
30 This they also did, and sent it to the
elders by the hands of Barnabas and
Saul.
1 Now about that me Herod the
king stretched out his hand to
harass some from the church.
2 Then he killed James the brother of
John with the sword.
3 And because he saw that it pleased
the Jews, he proceeded further to seize
Peter also. Now it was during the Days of
Unleavened Bread.
4 So when he had arrested him, he put
him in prison, and delivered him to four
squads of soldiers to keep him, intending
to bring him before the people a er
Passover.
12ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
73
5 Peter was therefore kept in prison,
but constant prayer was oﬀered to God
for him by the church.
6 And when Herod was about to bring
him out, that night Peter was sleeping,
bound with two chains between two
soldiers; and the guards before the door
were keeping the prison.
7 Now behold, an angel of the Lord
stood by him, and a light shone in
the prison; and he struck Peter on the
side and raised him up, saying, "Arise
quickly!" And his chains fell oﬀ his hands.
8 Then the angel said to him, "Gird
yourself and e on your sandals"; and so
he did. And he said to him, "Put on your
garment and follow me."
9 So he went out and followed him, and
did not know that what was done by
the angel was real, but thought he was
seeing a vision.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
74
10 When they were past the ﬁrst and
the second guard posts, they came to
the iron gate that leads to the city, which
opened to them of its own accord;
and they went out and went down
one street, and immediately the angel
departed from him.
11 And when Peter had come to himself,
he said, "Now I know for certain that
the Lord has sent His angel, and has
delivered me from the hand of Herod
and from all the expecta on of the
Jewish people."
12 So, when he had considered this, he
came to the house of Mary, the mother
of John whose surname was Mark,
where many were gathered together
praying.
13 And as Peter knocked at the door of
the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to
answer.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
75
14 When she recognized Peter’s voice,
because of her gladness she did not
open the gate, but ran in and announced
that Peter stood before the gate.
15 But they said to her, "You are beside
yourself!" Yet she kept insis ng that it
was so. So they said, "It is his angel."
16 Now Peter con nued knocking; and
when they opened the door and saw
him, they were astonished.
17 But mo oning to them with his hand
to keep silent, he declared to them how
the Lord had brought him out of the
prison. And he said, "Go, tell these things
to James and to the brethren." And he
departed and went to another place.
18 Then, as soon as it was day, there was
no small s r among the soldiers about
what had become of Peter.
19 But when Herod had searched for
him and not found him, he examined
the guards and commanded that theyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
76
should be put to death. And he went
down from Judea to Caesarea, and
stayed there.
20 Now Herod had been very angry
with the people of Tyre and Sidon; but
they came to him with one accord, and
having made Blastus the king’s personal
aide their friend, they asked for peace,
because their country was supplied with
food by the king’s country.
21 So on a set day Herod, arrayed in
royal apparel, sat on his throne and gave
an ora on to them.
22 And the people kept shou ng, "The
voice of a god and not of a man!"
23 Then immediately an angel of the
Lord struck him, because he did not
give glory to God. And he was eaten by
worms and died.
24 But the word of God grew and
mul plied.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12 – 13 77
25 And Barnabas and Saul returned
from Jerusalem when they had fulﬁlled
their ministry, and they also took with
them John whose surname was Mark.
1 Now in the church that was
at An och there were certain
prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of
Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought
up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
2 As they ministered to the Lord and
fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Now
separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for
the work to which I have called them."
3 Then, having fasted and prayed, and
laid hands on them, they sent them
away.
4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit,
they went down to Seleucia, and from
there they sailed to Cyprus.
5 And when they arrived in Salamis,
they preached the word of God in the
13ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
78
synagogues of the Jews. They also had
John as their assistant.
6 Now when they had gone through the
island to Paphos, they found a certain
sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose
name was Bar–Jesus,
7 who was with the proconsul, Sergius
Paulus, an intelligent man. This man
called for Barnabas and Saul and sought
to hear the word of God.
8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his
name is translated) withstood them,
seeking to turn the proconsul away from
the faith.
9 Then Saul, who also is called Paul,
ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently
at him
10 and said, "O full of all deceit and all
fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy
of all righteousness, will you not cease
perver ng the straight ways of the Lord?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
79
11 "And now, indeed, the hand of the
Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind,
not seeing the sun for a me." And
immediately a dark mist fell on him, and
he went around seeking someone to
lead him by the hand.
12 Then the proconsul believed, when
he saw what had been done, being
astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
13 Now when Paul and his party set
sail from Paphos, they came to Perga
in Pamphylia; and John, depar ng from
them, returned to Jerusalem.
14 But when they departed from Perga,
they came to An och in Pisidia, and
went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
day and sat down.
15 And a er the reading of the Law
and the Prophets, the rulers of the
synagogue sent to them, saying, "Men
and brethren, if you have any word of
exhorta on for the people, say on."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
16 Then Paul stood up, and mo
80
oning
with his hand said, "Men of Israel, and
you who fear God, listen:
17 "The God of this people Israel chose
our fathers, and exalted the people
when they dwelt as strangers in the land
of Egypt, and with an upli ed arm He
brought them out of it.
18 "Now for a me of about forty
years He put up with their ways in the
wilderness.
19 "And when He had destroyed
seven na ons in the land of Canaan,
He distributed their land to them by
allotment.
20 "A er that He gave them judges for
about four hundred and ﬁ y years, un l
Samuel the prophet.
21 "And a erward they asked for a king;
so God gave them Saul the son of Kish,
a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty
years.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
81
22 "And when He had removed him,
He raised up for them David as king, to
whom also He gave tes mony and said,
‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a
man a er My own heart, who will do all
My will.’
23 "From this man’s seed, according to
the promise, God raised up for Israel a
Savior––Jesus––
24 "a er John had ﬁrst preached, before
His coming, the bap sm of repentance
to all the people of Israel.
25 "And as John was ﬁnishing his course,
he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am
not He. But behold, there comes One
a er me, the sandals of whose feet I am
not worthy to loose.’
26 "Men and brethren, sons of the
family of Abraham, and those among
you who fear God, to you the word of
this salva on has been sent.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
82
27 "For those who dwell in Jerusalem,
and their rulers, because they did not
know Him, nor even the voices of the
Prophets which are read every Sabbath,
have fulﬁlled them in condemning Him.
28 "And though they found no cause for
death in Him, they asked Pilate that He
should be put to death.
29 "Now when they had fulﬁlled all that
was wri en concerning Him, they took
Him down from the tree and laid Him in
a tomb.
30 "But God raised Him from the dead.
31 "He was seen for many days by those
who came up with Him from Galilee to
Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the
people.
32 "And we declare to you glad dings–
–that promise which was made to the
fathers.
33 "God has fulﬁlled this for us their
children, in that He has raised up Jesus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
83
As it is also wri en in the second Psalm:
‘You are My Son, Today I have bego en
You.’
34 "And that He raised Him from the
dead, no more to return to corrup on,
He has spoken thus: ‘I will give you the
sure mercies of David.’
35 "Therefore He also says in another
Psalm: ‘You will not allow Your Holy One
to see corrup on.’
36 "For David, a er he had served his
own genera on by the will of God, fell
asleep, was buried with his fathers, and
saw corrup on;
37 "but He whom God raised up saw no
corrup on.
38 "Therefore let it be known to you,
brethren, that through this Man is
preached to you the forgiveness of sins;
39 "and by Him everyone who believes
is jus ﬁed from all things from whichACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
84
you could not be jus ﬁed by the law of
Moses.
40 "Beware therefore, lest what has
been spoken in the prophets come upon
you:
41 "Behold, you despisers, Marvel and
perish! For I work a work in your days,
A work which you will by no means
believe, Though one were to declare it
to you.’"
42 So when the Jews went out of the
synagogue, the Gen les begged that
these words might be preached to them
the next Sabbath.
43 Now when the congrega on had
broken up, many of the Jews and devout
proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas,
who, speaking to them, persuaded them
to con nue in the grace of God.
44 On the next Sabbath almost the
whole city came together to hear the
word of God.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
85
45 But when the Jews saw the
mul tudes, they were ﬁlled with envy;
and contradic ng and blaspheming, they
opposed the things spoken by Paul.
46 Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold
and said, "It was necessary that the word
of God should be spoken to you ﬁrst; but
since you reject it, and judge yourselves
unworthy of everlas ng life, behold, we
turn to the Gen les.
47 "For so the Lord has commanded us:
‘I have set you as a light to the Gen les,
That you should be for salva on to the
ends of the earth.’"
48 Now when the Gen les heard this,
they were glad and gloriﬁed the word
of the Lord. And as many as had been
appointed to eternal life believed.
49 And the word of the Lord was being
spread throughout all the region.
50 But the Jews s rred up the devout
and prominent women and the chiefACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13 – 14 86
men of the city, raised up persecu on
against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled
them from their region.
51 But they shook oﬀ the dust from
their feet against them, and came to
Iconium.
52 And the disciples were ﬁlled with joy
and with the Holy Spirit.
1 Now it happened in Iconium
that they went together to the
synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke
that a great mul tude both of the Jews
and of the Greeks believed.
2 But the unbelieving Jews s rred up
the Gen les and poisoned their minds
against the brethren.
3 Therefore they stayed there a long
me, speaking boldly in the Lord, who
was bearing witness to the word of His
grace, gran ng signs and wonders to be
done by their hands.
14ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
4 But the mul
87
tude of the city was
divided: part sided with the Jews, and
part with the apostles.
5 And when a violent a empt was made
by both the Gen les and Jews, with their
rulers, to abuse and stone them,
6 they became aware of it and ﬂed to
Lystra and Derbe, ci es of Lycaonia, and
to the surrounding region.
7 And they were preaching the gospel
there.
8 And in Lystra a certain man without
strength in his feet was si ng, a cripple
from his mother’s womb, who had never
walked.
9 This man heard Paul speaking. Paul,
observing him intently and seeing that
he had faith to be healed,
10 said with a loud voice, "Stand up
straight on your feet!" And he leaped
and walked.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
88
11 Now when the people saw what Paul
had done, they raised their voices, saying
in the Lycaonian language, "The gods
have come down to us in the likeness of
men!"
12 And Barnabas they called Zeus, and
Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief
speaker.
13 Then the priest of Zeus, whose
temple was in front of their city, brought
oxen and garlands to the gates, intending
to sacriﬁce with the mul tudes.
14 But when the apostles Barnabas and
Paul heard this, they tore their clothes
and ran in among the mul tude, crying
out
15 and saying, "Men, why are you doing
these things? We also are men with the
same nature as you, and preach to you
that you should turn from these useless
things to the living God, who made theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
89
heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things
that are in them,
16 "who in bygone genera ons allowed
all na ons to walk in their own ways.
17 "Nevertheless He did not leave
Himself without witness, in that He did
good, gave us rain from heaven and
frui ul seasons, ﬁlling our hearts with
food and gladness."
18 And with these sayings they could
scarcely restrain the mul tudes from
sacriﬁcing to them.
19 Then Jews from An och and Iconium
came there; and having persuaded
the mul tudes, they stoned Paul and
dragged him out of the city, supposing
him to be dead.
20 However, when the disciples
gathered around him, he rose up and
went into the city. And the next day he
departed with Barnabas to Derbe.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
90
21 And when they had preached the
gospel to that city and made many
disciples, they returned to Lystra,
Iconium, and An och,
22 strengthening the souls of the
disciples, exhor ng them to con nue in
the faith, and saying, "We must through
many tribula ons enter the kingdom of
God."
23 So when they had appointed elders
in every church, and prayed with fas ng,
they commended them to the Lord in
whom they had believed.
24 And a er they had passed through
Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
25 Now when they had preached the
word in Perga, they went down to
A alia.
26 From there they sailed to An och,
where they had been commended to
the grace of God for the work which they
had completed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14 – 15 91
27 Now when they had come and
gathered the church together, they
reported all that God had done with
them, and that He had opened the door
of faith to the Gen les.
28 So they stayed there a long me with
the disciples.
1 And certain men came down
from Judea and taught the
brethren, "Unless you are circumcised
according to the custom of Moses, you
cannot be saved."
2 Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas
had no small dissension and dispute
with them, they determined that Paul
and Barnabas and certain others of
them should go up to Jerusalem, to the
apostles and elders, about this ques on.
3 So, being sent on their way by the
church, they passed through Phoenicia
and Samaria, describing the conversion
15ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
92
of the Gen les; and they caused great
joy to all the brethren.
4 And when they had come to
Jerusalem, they were received by the
church and the apostles and the elders;
and they reported all things that God
had done with them.
5 But some of the sect of the Pharisees
who believed rose up, saying, "It is
necessary to circumcise them, and to
command them to keep the law of
Moses."
6 Now the apostles and elders came
together to consider this ma er.
7 And when there had been much
dispute, Peter rose up and said to them:
"Men and brethren, you know that a
good while ago God chose among us,
that by my mouth the Gen les should
hear the word of the gospel and believe.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
93
8 "So God, who knows the heart,
acknowledged them by giving them the
Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,
9 "and made no dis nc on between us
and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
10 "Now therefore, why do you test God
by pu ng a yoke on the neck of the
disciples which neither our fathers nor
we were able to bear?
11 "But we believe that through the
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be
saved in the same manner as they."
12 Then all the mul tude kept silent and
listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring
how many miracles and wonders God
had worked through them among the
Gen les.
13 And a er they had become silent,
James answered, saying, "Men and
brethren, listen to me:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
94
14 "Simon has declared how God at the
ﬁrst visited the Gen les to take out of
them a people for His name.
15 "And with this the words of the
prophets agree, just as it is wri en:
16 ‘A er this I will return And will rebuild
the tabernacle of David, which has fallen
down; I will rebuild its ruins, And I will
set it up;
17 So that the rest of mankind may seek
the LORD, Even all the Gen les who are
called by My name, Says the LORD who
does all these things.’
18 "Known to God from eternity are all
His works.
19 "Therefore I judge that we should not
trouble those from among the Gen les
who are turning to God,
20 "but that we write to them to abstain
from things polluted by idols, from
sexual immorality, from things strangled,
and from blood.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
95
21 "For Moses has had throughout
many genera ons those who preach
him in every city, being read in the
synagogues every Sabbath."
22 Then it pleased the apostles and
elders, with the whole church, to send
chosen men of their own company
to An och with Paul and Barnabas,
namely, Judas who was also named
Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among
the brethren.
23 They wrote this le er by them: The
apostles, the elders, and the brethren,
To the brethren who are of the Gen les
in An och, Syria, and Cilicia: Gree ngs.
24 Since we have heard that some who
went out from us have troubled you with
words, unse ling your souls, saying,
"You must be circumcised and keep
the law" ––to whom we gave no such
commandment––ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
96
25 it seemed good to us, being
assembled with one accord, to send
chosen men to you with our beloved
Barnabas and Paul,
26 men who have risked their lives for
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27 We have therefore sent Judas and
Silas, who will also report the same
things by word of mouth.
28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit,
and to us, to lay upon you no greater
burden than these necessary things:
29 that you abstain from things oﬀered
to idols, from blood, from things
strangled, and from sexual immorality. If
you keep yourselves from these, you will
do well. Farewell.
30 So when they were sent oﬀ, they
came to An och; and when they had
gathered the mul tude together, they
delivered the le er.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
97
31 When they had read it, they rejoiced
over its encouragement.
32 Now Judas and Silas, themselves
being prophets also, exhorted and
strengthened the brethren with many
words.
33 And a er they had stayed there for a
me, they were sent back with gree ngs
from the brethren to the apostles.
34 However, it seemed good to Silas to
remain there.
35 Paul and Barnabas also remained
in An och, teaching and preaching the
word of the Lord, with many others also.
36 Then a er some days Paul said to
Barnabas, "Let us now go back and visit
our brethren in every city where we
have preached the word of the Lord, and
see how they are doing."
37 Now Barnabas was determined to
take with them John called Mark.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15 – 16 98
38 But Paul insisted that they should
not take with them the one who had
departed from them in Pamphylia, and
had not gone with them to the work.
39 Then the conten on became so
sharp that they parted from one another.
And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed
to Cyprus;
40 but Paul chose Silas and departed,
being commended by the brethren to
the grace of God.
41 And he went through Syria and
Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
1 Then he came to Derbe and
Lystra. And behold, a certain
disciple was there, named Timothy, the
son of a certain Jewish woman who
believed, but his father was Greek.
2 He was well spoken of by the brethren
who were at Lystra and Iconium.
3 Paul wanted to have him go on with
him. And he took him and circumcised
16ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
99
him because of the Jews who were in
that region, for they all knew that his
father was Greek.
4 And as they went through the ci es,
they delivered to them the decrees to
keep, which were determined by the
apostles and elders at Jerusalem.
5 So the churches were strengthened in
the faith, and increased in number daily.
6 Now when they had gone through
Phrygia and the region of Gala a, they
were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to
preach the word in Asia.
7 A er they had come to Mysia, they
tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit
did not permit them.
8 So passing by Mysia, they came down
to Troas.
9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the
night. A man of Macedonia stood and
pleaded with him, saying, "Come over to
Macedonia and help us."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
10 Now a
100
er he had seen the vision,
immediately we sought to go to
Macedonia, concluding that the Lord
had called us to preach the gospel to
them.
11 Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran
a straight course to Samothrace, and the
next day came to Neapolis,
12 and from there to Philippi, which
is the foremost city of that part of
Macedonia, a colony. And we were
staying in that city for some days.
13 And on the Sabbath day we went out
of the city to the riverside, where prayer
was customarily made; and we sat down
and spoke to the women who met there.
14 Now a certain woman named Lydia
heard us. She was a seller of purple from
the city of Thya ra, who worshiped God.
The Lord opened her heart to heed the
things spoken by Paul.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
101
15 And when she and her household
were bap zed, she begged us, saying, "If
you have judged me to be faithful to the
Lord, come to my house and stay." So
she persuaded us.
16 Now it happened, as we went to
prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed
with a spirit of divina on met us, who
brought her masters much proﬁt by
fortune–telling.
17 This girl followed Paul and us, and
cried out, saying, "These men are the
servants of the Most High God, who
proclaim to us the way of salva on."
18 And this she did for many days. But
Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to
the spirit, "I command you in the name
of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And
he came out that very hour.
19 But when her masters saw that their
hope of proﬁt was gone, they seizedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
102
Paul and Silas and dragged them into the
marketplace to the authori es.
20 And they brought them to the
magistrates, and said, "These men, being
Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;
21 "and they teach customs which are
not lawful for us, being Romans, to
receive or observe."
22 Then the mul tude rose up together
against them; and the magistrates tore
oﬀ their clothes and commanded them
to be beaten with rods.
23 And when they had laid many stripes
on them, they threw them into prison,
commanding the jailer to keep them
securely.
24 Having received such a charge, he put
them into the inner prison and fastened
their feet in the stocks.
25 But at midnight Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns to God, and
the prisoners were listening to them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
103
26 Suddenly there was a great
earthquake, so that the founda ons
of the prison were shaken; and
immediately all the doors were opened
and everyone’s chains were loosed.
27 And the keeper of the prison,
awaking from sleep and seeing the
prison doors open, supposing the
prisoners had ﬂed, drew his sword and
was about to kill himself.
28 But Paul called with a loud voice,
saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are
all here."
29 Then he called for a light, ran in, and
fell down trembling before Paul and
Silas.
30 And he brought them out and said,
"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
31 So they said, "Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you
and your household."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
104
32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord
to him and to all who were in his house.
33 And he took them the same hour of
the night and washed their stripes. And
immediately he and all his family were
bap zed.
34 Now when he had brought them into
his house, he set food before them; and
he rejoiced, having believed in God with
all his household.
35 And when it was day, the magistrates
sent the oﬃcers, saying, "Let those men
go."
36 So the keeper of the prison reported
these words to Paul, saying, "The
magistrates have sent to let you go. Now
therefore depart, and go in peace."
37 But Paul said to them, "They have
beaten us openly, uncondemned
Romans, and have thrown us into prison.
And now do they put us out secretly? NoACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16 – 17 105
indeed! Let them come themselves and
get us out."
38 And the oﬃcers told these words
to the magistrates, and they were
afraid when they heard that they were
Romans.
39 Then they came and pleaded with
them and brought them out, and asked
them to depart from the city.
40 So they went out of the prison
and entered the house of Lydia; and
when they had seen the brethren, they
encouraged them and departed.
1 Now when they had passed
through Amphipolis and
Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
where there was a synagogue of the
Jews.
2 Then Paul, as his custom was, went
in to them, and for three Sabbaths
reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
17ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
3 explaining and demonstra
106
ng that the
Christ had to suﬀer and rise again from
the dead, and saying, "This Jesus whom I
preach to you is the Christ."
4 And some of them were persuaded;
and a great mul tude of the devout
Greeks, and not a few of the leading
women, joined Paul and Silas.
5 But the Jews who were not persuaded,
becoming envious, took some of the
evil men from the marketplace, and
gathering a mob, set all the city in an
uproar and a acked the house of Jason,
and sought to bring them out to the
people.
6 But when they did not ﬁnd them, they
dragged Jason and some brethren to
the rulers of the city, crying out, "These
who have turned the world upside down
have come here too.
7 "Jason has harbored them, and these
are all ac ng contrary to the decreesACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
107
of Caesar, saying there is another
king––Jesus."
8 And they troubled the crowd and the
rulers of the city when they heard these
things.
9 So when they had taken security from
Jason and the rest, they let them go.
10 Then the brethren immediately sent
Paul and Silas away by night to Berea.
When they arrived, they went into the
synagogue of the Jews.
11 These were more fair–minded than
those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness,
and searched the Scriptures daily to ﬁnd
out whether these things were so.
12 Therefore many of them believed,
and also not a few of the Greeks,
prominent women as well as men.
13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica
learned that the word of God wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
108
preached by Paul at Berea, they came
there also and s rred up the crowds.
14 Then immediately the brethren sent
Paul away, to go to the sea; but both
Silas and Timothy remained there.
15 So those who conducted Paul
brought him to Athens; and receiving a
command for Silas and Timothy to come
to him with all speed, they departed.
16 Now while Paul waited for them at
Athens, his spirit was provoked within
him when he saw that the city was given
over to idols.
17 Therefore he reasoned in the
synagogue with the Jews and with
the Gen le worshipers, and in the
marketplace daily with those who
happened to be there.
18 Then certain Epicurean and Stoic
philosophers encountered him. And
some said, "What does this babbler
want to say?" Others said, "He seemsACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
109
to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,"
because he preached to them Jesus and
the resurrec on.
19 And they took him and brought him
to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know
what this new doctrine is of which you
speak?
20 "For you are bringing some strange
things to our ears. Therefore we want to
know what these things mean."
21 For all the Athenians and the
foreigners who were there spent their
me in nothing else but either to tell or
to hear some new thing.
22 Then Paul stood in the midst of the
Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I
perceive that in all things you are very
religious;
23 "for as I was passing through and
considering the objects of your worship, I
even found an altar with this inscrip on:
TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
110
the One whom you worship without
knowing, Him I proclaim to you:
24 "God, who made the world and
everything in it, since He is Lord of
heaven and earth, does not dwell in
temples made with hands.
25 "Nor is He worshiped with men’s
hands, as though He needed anything,
since He gives to all life, breath, and all
things.
26 "And He has made from one blood
every na on of men to dwell on all the
face of the earth, and has determined
their preappointed mes and the
boundaries of their dwellings,
27 "so that they should seek the Lord, in
the hope that they might grope for Him
and ﬁnd Him, though He is not far from
each one of us;
28 "for in Him we live and move and
have our being, as also some of yourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
111
own poets have said, ‘For we are also His
oﬀspring.’
29 "Therefore, since we are the oﬀspring
of God, we ought not to think that the
Divine Nature is like gold or silver or
stone, something shaped by art and
man’s devising.
30 "Truly, these mes of ignorance God
overlooked, but now commands all men
everywhere to repent,
31 "because He has appointed a day
on which He will judge the world in
righteousness by the Man whom He has
ordained. He has given assurance of this
to all by raising Him from the dead."
32 And when they heard of the
resurrec on of the dead, some mocked,
while others said, "We will hear you
again on this ma er."
33 So Paul departed from among them.
34 However, some men joined him and
believed, among them Dionysius theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
112
Areopagite, a woman named Damaris,
and others with them.
1 A er these things Paul departed
from Athens and went to Corinth.
2 And he found a certain Jew named
Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently
come from Italy with his wife Priscilla
(because Claudius had commanded all
the Jews to depart from Rome); and he
came to them.
3 So, because he was of the same trade,
he stayed with them and worked; for by
occupa on they were tentmakers.
4 And he reasoned in the synagogue
every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews
and Greeks.
5 When Silas and Timothy had come
from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by
the Spirit, and tes ﬁed to the Jews that
Jesus is the Christ.
6 But when they opposed him and
blasphemed, he shook his garments and
18ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
113
said to them, "Your blood be upon your
own heads; I am clean. From now on I
will go to the Gen les."
7 And he departed from there and
entered the house of a certain man
named Justus, one who worshiped God,
whose house was next door to the
synagogue.
8 Then Crispus, the ruler of the
synagogue, believed on the Lord with
all his household. And many of the
Corinthians, hearing, believed and were
bap zed.
9 Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the
night by a vision, "Do not be afraid, but
speak, and do not keep silent;
10 "for I am with you, and no one will
a ack you to hurt you; for I have many
people in this city."
11 And he con nued there a year and
six months, teaching the word of God
among them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
114
12 When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,
the Jews with one accord rose up against
Paul and brought him to the judgment
seat,
13 saying, "This fellow persuades men
to worship God contrary to the law."
14 And when Paul was about to open
his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it
were a ma er of wrongdoing or wicked
crimes, O Jews, there would be reason
why I should bear with you.
15 "But if it is a ques on of words and
names and your own law, look to it
yourselves; for I do not want to be a
judge of such ma ers."
16 And he drove them from the
judgment seat.
17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes,
the ruler of the synagogue, and beat
him before the judgment seat. But Gallio
took no no ce of these things.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
18 So Paul s
115
ll remained a good while.
Then he took leave of the brethren and
sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila
were with him. He had his hair cut oﬀ at
Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow.
19 And he came to Ephesus, and le
them there; but he himself entered the
synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
20 When they asked him to stay a longer
me with them, he did not consent,
21 but took leave of them, saying, "I
must by all means keep this coming feast
in Jerusalem; but I will return again to
you, God willing." And he sailed from
Ephesus.
22 And when he had landed at Caesarea,
and gone up and greeted the church, he
went down to An och.
23 A er he had spent some me
there, he departed and went over the
region of Gala a and Phrygia in order,
strengthening all the disciples.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
116
24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos,
born at Alexandria, an eloquent man
and mighty in the Scriptures, came to
Ephesus.
25 This man had been instructed in the
way of the Lord; and being fervent in
spirit, he spoke and taught accurately
the things of the Lord, though he knew
only the bap sm of John.
26 So he began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla
heard him, they took him aside and
explained to him the way of God more
accurately.
27 And when he desired to cross to
Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhor ng
the disciples to receive him; and when
he arrived, he greatly helped those who
had believed through grace;
28 for he vigorously refuted the Jews
publicly, showing from the Scriptures
that Jesus is the Christ.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
19
117
1 And it happened, while Apollos
was at Corinth, that Paul, having
passed through the upper regions, came
to Ephesus. And ﬁnding some disciples
2 he said to them, "Did you receive the
Holy Spirit when you believed?" So they
said to him, "We have not so much as
heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."
3 And he said to them, "Into what then
were you bap zed?" So they said, "Into
John’s bap sm."
4 Then Paul said, "John indeed bap zed
with a bap sm of repentance, saying to
the people that they should believe on
Him who would come a er him, that is,
on Christ Jesus."
5 When they heard this, they were
bap zed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6 And when Paul had laid hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came upon them,
and they spoke with tongues and
prophesied.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
118
7 Now the men were about twelve in
all.
8 And he went into the synagogue and
spoke boldly for three months, reasoning
and persuading concerning the things of
the kingdom of God.
9 But when some were hardened and
did not believe, but spoke evil of the
Way before the mul tude, he departed
from them and withdrew the disciples,
reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
10 And this con nued for two years, so
that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word
of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
11 Now God worked unusual miracles
by the hands of Paul,
12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons
were brought from his body to the sick,
and the diseases le them and the evil
spirits went out of them.
13 Then some of the i nerant Jewish
exorcists took it upon themselves to callACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
119
the name of the Lord Jesus over those
who had evil spirits, saying, "We exorcise
you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches."
14 Also there were seven sons of Sceva,
a Jewish chief priest, who did so.
15 And the evil spirit answered and said,
"Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who
are you?"
16 Then the man in whom the evil
spirit was leaped on them, overpowered
them, and prevailed against them, so
that they ﬂed out of that house naked
and wounded.
17 This became known both to all Jews
and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear
fell on them all, and the name of the
Lord Jesus was magniﬁed.
18 And many who had believed came
confessing and telling their deeds.
19 Also, many of those who had
prac ced magic brought their books
together and burned them in the sightACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
120
of all. And they counted up the value
of them, and it totaled ﬁ y thousand
pieces of silver.
20 So the word of the Lord grew migh ly
and prevailed.
21 When these things were
accomplished, Paul purposed in
the Spirit, when he had passed through
Macedonia and Achaia, to go to
Jerusalem, saying, "A er I have been
there, I must also see Rome."
22 So he sent into Macedonia two of
those who ministered to him, Timothy
and Erastus, but he himself stayed in
Asia for a me.
23 And about that me there arose a
great commo on about the Way.
24 For a certain man named Demetrius,
a silversmith, who made silver shrines
of Diana, brought no small proﬁt to the
cra smen.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
121
25 He called them together with the
workers of similar occupa on, and
said: "Men, you know that we have our
prosperity by this trade.
26 "Moreover you see and hear that not
only at Ephesus, but throughout almost
all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and
turned away many people, saying that
they are not gods which are made with
hands.
27 "So not only is this trade of ours in
danger of falling into disrepute, but also
the temple of the great goddess Diana
may be despised and her magniﬁcence
destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worship."
28 Now when they heard this, they
were full of wrath and cried out, saying,
"Great is Diana of the Ephesians!"
29 So the whole city was ﬁlled with
confusion, and rushed into the theater
with one accord, having seized Gaius andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
122
Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s travel
companions.
30 And when Paul wanted to go in to the
people, the disciples would not allow
him.
31 Then some of the oﬃcials of Asia,
who were his friends, sent to him
pleading that he would not venture into
the theater.
32 Some therefore cried one thing and
some another, for the assembly was
confused, and most of them did not
know why they had come together.
33 And they drew Alexander out of the
mul tude, the Jews pu ng him forward.
And Alexander mo oned with his hand,
and wanted to make his defense to the
people.
34 But when they found out that he was
a Jew, all with one voice cried out for
about two hours, "Great is Diana of the
Ephesians!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
123
35 And when the city clerk had quieted
the crowd, he said: "Men of Ephesus,
what man is there who does not know
that the city of the Ephesians is temple
guardian of the great goddess Diana,
and of the image which fell down from
Zeus?
36 "Therefore, since these things cannot
be denied, you ought to be quiet and do
nothing rashly.
37 "For you have brought these men
here who are neither robbers of temples
nor blasphemers of your goddess.
38 "Therefore, if Demetrius and his
fellow cra smen have a case against
anyone, the courts are open and there
are proconsuls. Let them bring charges
against one another.
39 "But if you have any other inquiry
to make, it shall be determined in the
lawful assembly.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19 – 20 124
40 "For we are in danger of being called
in ques on for today’s uproar, there
being no reason which we may give to
account for this disorderly gathering."
41 And when he had said these things,
he dismissed the assembly.
1 A er the uproar had ceased,
Paul called the disciples to
himself, embraced them, and departed
to go to Macedonia.
2 Now when he had gone over that
region and encouraged them with many
words, he came to Greece
3 and stayed three months. And when
the Jews plo ed against him as he was
about to sail to Syria, he decided to
return through Macedonia.
4 And Sopater of Berea accompanied
him to Asia––also Aristarchus and
Secundus of the Thessalonians, and
Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and
Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
20ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
125
5 These men, going ahead, waited for
us at Troas.
6 But we sailed away from Philippi a er
the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in
ﬁve days joined them at Troas, where we
stayed seven days.
7 Now on the ﬁrst day of the week,
when the disciples came together to
break bread, Paul, ready to depart the
next day, spoke to them and con nued
his message un l midnight.
8 There were many lamps in the
upper room where they were gathered
together.
9 And in a window sat a certain young
man named Eutychus, who was sinking
into a deep sleep. He was overcome by
sleep; and as Paul con nued speaking,
he fell down from the third story and
was taken up dead.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
126
10 But Paul went down, fell on him, and
embracing him said, "Do not trouble
yourselves, for his life is in him."
11 Now when he had come up, had
broken bread and eaten, and talked
a long while, even ll daybreak, he
departed.
12 And they brought the young man
in alive, and they were not a li le
comforted.
13 Then we went ahead to the ship
and sailed to Assos, there intending to
take Paul on board; for so he had given
orders, intending himself to go on foot.
14 And when he met us at Assos,
we took him on board and came to
Mitylene.
15 We sailed from there, and the next
day came opposite Chios. The following
day we arrived at Samos and stayed at
Trogyllium. The next day we came to
Miletus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
127
16 For Paul had decided to sail past
Ephesus, so that he would not have to
spend me in Asia; for he was hurrying
to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the
Day of Pentecost.
17 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and
called for the elders of the church.
18 And when they had come to him, he
said to them: "You know, from the ﬁrst
day that I came to Asia, in what manner
I always lived among you,
19 "serving the Lord with all humility,
with many tears and trials which
happened to me by the plo ng of the
Jews;
20 "how I kept back nothing that was
helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and
taught you publicly and from house to
house,
21 "tes fying to Jews, and also to
Greeks, repentance toward God and
faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
128
22 "And see, now I go bound in the spirit
to Jerusalem, not knowing the things
that will happen to me there,
23 "except that the Holy Spirit tes ﬁes
in every city, saying that chains and
tribula ons await me.
24 "But none of these things move me;
nor do I count my life dear to myself, so
that I may ﬁnish my race with joy, and
the ministry which I received from the
Lord Jesus, to tes fy to the gospel of the
grace of God.
25 "And indeed, now I know that you
all, among whom I have gone preaching
the kingdom of God, will see my face no
more.
26 "Therefore I tes fy to you this day
that I am innocent of the blood of all
men.
27 "For I have not shunned to declare to
you the whole counsel of God.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
129
28 "Therefore take heed to yourselves
and to all the ﬂock, among which the
Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to
shepherd the church of God which He
purchased with His own blood.
29 "For I know this, that a er my
departure savage wolves will come in
among you, not sparing the ﬂock.
30 "Also from among yourselves
men will rise up, speaking perverse
things, to draw away the disciples a er
themselves.
31 "Therefore watch, and remember
that for three years I did not cease to
warn everyone night and day with tears.
32 "So now, brethren, I commend you to
God and to the word of His grace, which
is able to build you up and give you an
inheritance among all those who are
sanc ﬁed.
33 "I have coveted no one’s silver or
gold or apparel.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20 – 21 130
34 "Yes, you yourselves know that these
hands have provided for my necessi es,
and for those who were with me.
35 "I have shown you in every way, by
laboring like this, that you must support
the weak. And remember the words of
the Lord Jesus, that He said, ‘It is more
blessed to give than to receive.’"
36 And when he had said these things,
he knelt down and prayed with them all.
37 Then they all wept freely, and fell on
Paul’s neck and kissed him,
38 sorrowing most of all for the words
which he spoke, that they would see his
face no more. And they accompanied
him to the ship.
1 Now it came to pass, that when
we had departed from them
and set sail, running a straight course
we came to Cos, the following day to
Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
21ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
131
2 And ﬁnding a ship sailing over to
Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
3 When we had sighted Cyprus, we
passed it on the le , sailed to Syria, and
landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to
unload her cargo.
4 And ﬁnding disciples, we stayed there
seven days. They told Paul through the
Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.
5 When we had come to the end of
those days, we departed and went on
our way; and they all accompanied us,
with wives and children, ll we were out
of the city. And we knelt down on the
shore and prayed.
6 When we had taken our leave of one
another, we boarded the ship, and they
returned home.
7 And when we had ﬁnished our voyage
from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais,
greeted the brethren, and stayed with
them one day.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
132
8 On the next day we who were Paul’s
companions departed and came to
Caesarea, and entered the house of
Philip the evangelist, who was one of the
seven, and stayed with him.
9 Now this man had four virgin
daughters who prophesied.
10 And as we stayed many days, a
certain prophet named Agabus came
down from Judea.
11 When he had come to us, he took
Paul’s belt, bound his own hands and
feet, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit,
‘So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the
man who owns this belt, and deliver him
into the hands of the Gen les.’"
12 Now when we heard these things,
both we and those from that place
pleaded with him not to go up to
Jerusalem.
13 Then Paul answered, "What do you
mean by weeping and breaking myACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
133
heart? For I am ready not only to be
bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for
the name of the Lord Jesus."
14 So when he would not be persuaded,
we ceased, saying, "The will of the Lord
be done."
15 And a er those days we packed and
went up to Jerusalem.
16 Also some of the disciples from
Caesarea went with us and brought with
them a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an
early disciple, with whom we were to
lodge.
17 And when we had come to Jerusalem,
the brethren received us gladly.
18 On the following day Paul went in
with us to James, and all the elders were
present.
19 When he had greeted them, he told
in detail those things which God had
done among the Gen les through his
ministry.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
134
20 And when they heard it, they
gloriﬁed the Lord. And they said to him,
"You see, brother, how many myriads of
Jews there are who have believed, and
they are all zealous for the law;
21 "but they have been informed about
you that you teach all the Jews who are
among the Gen les to forsake Moses,
saying that they ought not to circumcise
their children nor to walk according to
the customs.
22 "What then? The assembly must
certainly meet, for they will hear that
you have come.
23 "Therefore do what we tell you: We
have four men who have taken a vow.
24 "Take them and be puriﬁed with
them, and pay their expenses so that
they may shave their heads, and that all
may know that those things of which
they were informed concerning you areACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
135
nothing, but that you yourself also walk
orderly and keep the law.
25 "But concerning the Gen les who
believe, we have wri en and decided
that they should observe no such thing,
except that they should keep themselves
from things oﬀered to idols, from blood,
from things strangled, and from sexual
immorality."
26 Then Paul took the men, and the next
day, having been puriﬁed with them,
entered the temple to announce the
expira on of the days of puriﬁca on, at
which me an oﬀering should be made
for each one of them.
27 Now when the seven days were
almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing
him in the temple, s rred up the whole
crowd and laid hands on him,
28 crying out, "Men of Israel, help!
This is the man who teaches all men
everywhere against the people, the law,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
136
and this place; and furthermore he also
brought Greeks into the temple and has
deﬁled this holy place."
29 (For they had previously seen
Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the
city, whom they supposed that Paul had
brought into the temple.)
30 And all the city was disturbed; and
the people ran together, seized Paul,
and dragged him out of the temple; and
immediately the doors were shut.
31 Now as they were seeking to kill him,
news came to the commander of the
garrison that all Jerusalem was in an
uproar.
32 He immediately took soldiers and
centurions, and ran down to them. And
when they saw the commander and the
soldiers, they stopped bea ng Paul.
33 Then the commander came near and
took him, and commanded him to beACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
137
bound with two chains; and he asked
who he was and what he had done.
34 And some among the mul tude cried
one thing and some another. So when
he could not ascertain the truth because
of the tumult, he commanded him to be
taken into the barracks.
35 When he reached the stairs, he had
to be carried by the soldiers because of
the violence of the mob.
36 For the mul tude of the people
followed a er, crying out, "Away with
him!"
37 Then as Paul was about to be led into
the barracks, he said to the commander,
"May I speak to you?" He replied, "Can
you speak Greek?
38 "Are you not the Egyp an who some
me ago s rred up a rebellion and led
the four thousand assassins out into the
wilderness?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21 – 22 138
39 But Paul said, "I am a Jew from
Tarsus, in Cilicia, a ci zen of no mean
city; and I implore you, permit me to
speak to the people."
40 So when he had given him
permission, Paul stood on the stairs and
mo oned with his hand to the people.
And when there was a great silence, he
spoke to them in the Hebrew language,
saying,
1 "Brethren and fathers, hear my
defense before you now."
2 And when they heard that he spoke to
them in the Hebrew language, they kept
all the more silent. Then he said:
3 "I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of
Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the
feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the
strictness of our fathers’ law, and was
zealous toward God as you all are today.
22ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
139
4 "I persecuted this Way to the death,
binding and delivering into prisons both
men and women,
5 "as also the high priest bears me
witness, and all the council of the elders,
from whom I also received le ers to
the brethren, and went to Damascus to
bring in chains even those who were
there to Jerusalem to be punished.
6 "Now it happened, as I journeyed and
came near Damascus at about noon,
suddenly a great light from heaven
shone around me.
7 "And I fell to the ground and heard a
voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are
you persecu ng Me?’
8 "So I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’
And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus of
Nazareth, whom you are persecu ng.’
9 "And those who were with me indeed
saw the light and were afraid, but theyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
140
did not hear the voice of Him who spoke
to me.
10 "So I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’
And the Lord said to me, ‘Arise and go
into Damascus, and there you will be
told all things which are appointed for
you to do.’
11 "And since I could not see for the
glory of that light, being led by the hand
of those who were with me, I came into
Damascus.
12 "Then a certain Ananias, a devout
man according to the law, having a good
tes mony with all the Jews who dwelt
there,
13 "came to me; and he stood and said
to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’
And at that same hour I looked up at
him.
14 "Then he said, ‘The God of our
fathers has chosen you that you shouldACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
141
know His will, and see the Just One, and
hear the voice of His mouth.
15 ‘For you will be His witness to all men
of what you have seen and heard.
16 ‘And now why are you wai ng? Arise
and be bap zed, and wash away your
sins, calling on the name of the Lord.’
17 "Now it happened, when I returned
to Jerusalem and was praying in the
temple, that I was in a trance
18 "and saw Him saying to me, ‘Make
haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly,
for they will not receive your tes mony
concerning Me.’
19 "So I said, ‘Lord, they know that in
every synagogue I imprisoned and beat
those who believe on You.
20 ‘And when the blood of Your martyr
Stephen was shed, I also was standing
by consen ng to his death, and guarding
the clothes of those who were killing
him.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
142
21 "Then He said to me, ‘Depart, for
I will send you far from here to the
Gen les.’"
22 And they listened to him un l this
word, and then they raised their voices
and said, "Away with such a fellow from
the earth, for he is not ﬁt to live!"
23 Then, as they cried out and tore oﬀ
their clothes and threw dust into the air,
24 the commander ordered him to be
brought into the barracks, and said that
he should be examined under scourging,
so that he might know why they shouted
so against him.
25 And as they bound him with thongs,
Paul said to the centurion who stood by,
"Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
who is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
26 When the centurion heard that, he
went and told the commander, saying,
"Take care what you do, for this man is a
Roman."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22 – 23 143
27 Then the commander came and said
to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" He
said, "Yes."
28 The commander answered, "With a
large sum I obtained this ci zenship."
And Paul said, "But I was born a ci zen."
29 Then immediately those who were
about to examine him withdrew from
him; and the commander was also afraid
a er he found out that he was a Roman,
and because he had bound him.
30 The next day, because he wanted to
know for certain why he was accused
by the Jews, he released him from his
bonds, and commanded the chief priests
and all their council to appear, and
brought Paul down and set him before
them.
1 Then Paul, looking earnestly
at the council, said, "Men and
brethren, I have lived in all good
conscience before God un l this day."
23ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
144
2 And the high priest Ananias
commanded those who stood by him to
strike him on the mouth.
3 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike
you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit
to judge me according to the law, and do
you command me to be struck contrary
to the law?"
4 And those who stood by said, "Do you
revile God’s high priest?"
5 Then Paul said, "I did not know,
brethren, that he was the high priest; for
it is wri en, ‘You shall not speak evil of a
ruler of your people.’"
6 But when Paul perceived that one
part were Sadducees and the other
Pharisees, he cried out in the council,
"Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the
son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope
and resurrec on of the dead I am being
judged!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
145
7 And when he had said this, a
dissension arose between the Pharisees
and the Sadducees; and the assembly
was divided.
8 For Sadducees say that there is no
resurrec on––and no angel or spirit; but
the Pharisees confess both.
9 Then there arose a loud outcry. And
the scribes of the Pharisees’ party arose
and protested, saying, "We ﬁnd no evil
in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has
spoken to him, let us not ﬁght against
God."
10 Now when there arose a great
dissension, the commander, fearing lest
Paul might be pulled to pieces by them,
commanded the soldiers to go down and
take him by force from among them, and
bring him into the barracks.
11 But the following night the Lord
stood by him and said, "Be of good
cheer, Paul; for as you have tes ﬁed forACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
146
Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear
witness at Rome."
12 And when it was day, some of
the Jews banded together and bound
themselves under an oath, saying that
they would neither eat nor drink ll they
had killed Paul.
13 Now there were more than forty who
had formed this conspiracy.
14 They came to the chief priests and
elders, and said, "We have bound
ourselves under a great oath that we will
eat nothing un l we have killed Paul.
15 "Now you, therefore, together with
the council, suggest to the commander
that he be brought down to you
tomorrow, as though you were going to
make further inquiries concerning him;
but we are ready to kill him before he
comes near."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
147
16 So when Paul’s sister’s son heard of
their ambush, he went and entered the
barracks and told Paul.
17 Then Paul called one of the
centurions to him and said, "Take this
young man to the commander, for he
has something to tell him."
18 So he took him and brought him
to the commander and said, "Paul the
prisoner called me to him and asked me
to bring this young man to you. He has
something to say to you."
19 Then the commander took him by
the hand, went aside and asked privately,
"What is it that you have to tell me?"
20 And he said, "The Jews have agreed
to ask that you bring Paul down to the
council tomorrow, as though they were
going to inquire more fully about him.
21 "But do not yield to them, for more
than forty of them lie in wait for him,
men who have bound themselves by anACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
148
oath that they will neither eat nor drink
ll they have killed him; and now they
are ready, wai ng for the promise from
you."
22 So the commander let the young
man depart, and commanded him, "Tell
no one that you have revealed these
things to me."
23 And he called for two centurions,
saying, "Prepare two hundred soldiers,
seventy horsemen, and two hundred
spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third
hour of the night;
24 "and provide mounts to set Paul
on, and bring him safely to Felix the
governor."
25 He wrote a le er in the following
manner:
26 Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent
governor Felix: Gree ngs.
27 This man was seized by the Jews and
was about to be killed by them. ComingACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
149
with the troops I rescued him, having
learned that he was a Roman.
28 And when I wanted to know the
reason they accused him, I brought him
before their council.
29 I found out that he was accused
concerning ques ons of their law,
but had nothing charged against him
deserving of death or chains.
30 And when it was told me that the
Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent
him immediately to you, and also
commanded his accusers to state before
you the charges against him. Farewell.
31 Then the soldiers, as they were
commanded, took Paul and brought him
by night to An patris.
32 The next day they le the horsemen
to go on with him, and returned to the
barracks.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23 – 24 150
33 When they came to Caesarea and
had delivered the le er to the governor,
they also presented Paul to him.
34 And when the governor had read it,
he asked what province he was from.
And when he understood that he was
from Cilicia,
35 he said, "I will hear you when your
accusers also have come." And he
commanded him to be kept in Herod’s
Praetorium.
1 Now a er ﬁve days Ananias
the high priest came down with
the elders and a certain orator named
Tertullus. These gave evidence to the
governor against Paul.
2 And when he was called upon,
Tertullus began his accusa on, saying:
"Seeing that through you we enjoy great
peace, and prosperity is being brought
to this na on by your foresight,
24ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
151
3 "we accept it always and in all places,
most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
4 "Nevertheless, not to be tedious to
you any further, I beg you to hear, by
your courtesy, a few words from us.
5 "For we have found this man a plague,
a creator of dissension among all the
Jews throughout the world, and a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
6 "He even tried to profane the temple,
and we seized him, and wanted to judge
him according to our law.
7 "But the commander Lysias came by
and with great violence took him out of
our hands,
8 "commanding his accusers to come to
you. By examining him yourself you may
ascertain all these things of which we
accuse him."
9 And the Jews also assented,
maintaining that these things were so.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
10 Then Paul, a
152
er the governor had
nodded to him to speak, answered:
"Inasmuch as I know that you have been
for many years a judge of this na on, I do
the more cheerfully answer for myself,
11 "because you may ascertain that it is
no more than twelve days since I went
up to Jerusalem to worship.
12 "And they neither found me in
the temple dispu ng with anyone
nor inci ng the crowd, either in the
synagogues or in the city.
13 "Nor can they prove the things of
which they now accuse me.
14 "But this I confess to you, that
according to the Way which they call a
sect, so I worship the God of my fathers,
believing all things which are wri en in
the Law and in the Prophets.
15 "I have hope in God, which they
themselves also accept, that there willACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
153
be a resurrec on of the dead, both of
the just and the unjust.
16 "This being so, I myself always strive
to have a conscience without oﬀense
toward God and men.
17 "Now a er many years I came to
bring alms and oﬀerings to my na on,
18 "in the midst of which some Jews
from Asia found me puriﬁed in the
temple, neither with a mob nor with
tumult.
19 "They ought to have been here
before you to object if they had anything
against me.
20 "Or else let those who are here
themselves say if they found any
wrongdoing in me while I stood before
the council,
21 "unless it is for this one statement
which I cried out, standing among them,
‘Concerning the resurrec on of the dead
I am being judged by you this day.’"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
154
22 But when Felix heard these things,
having more accurate knowledge of
the Way, he adjourned the proceedings
and said, "When Lysias the commander
comes down, I will make a decision on
your case."
23 So he commanded the centurion to
keep Paul and to let him have liberty,
and told him not to forbid any of his
friends to provide for or visit him.
24 And a er some days, when Felix
came with his wife Drusilla, who was
Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him
concerning the faith in Christ.
25 Now as he reasoned about
righteousness, self–control, and the
judgment to come, Felix was afraid and
answered, "Go away for now; when I
have a convenient me I will call for
you."
26 Meanwhile he also hoped that
money would be given him by Paul, thatACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24 – 25 155
he might release him. Therefore he sent
for him more o en and conversed with
him.
27 But a er two years Porcius Festus
succeeded Felix; and Felix, wan ng to do
the Jews a favor, le Paul bound.
1 Now when Festus had come to
the province, a er three days he
went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
2 Then the high priest and the chief
men of the Jews informed him against
Paul; and they pe oned him,
3 asking a favor against him, that he
would summon him to Jerusalem––while
they lay in ambush along the road to kill
him.
4 But Festus answered that Paul should
be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself
was going there shortly.
5 "Therefore," he said, "let those who
have authority among you go down with
25ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
156
me and accuse this man, to see if there
is any fault in him."
6 And when he had remained among
them more than ten days, he went down
to Caesarea. And the next day, si ng on
the judgment seat, he commanded Paul
to be brought.
7 When he had come, the Jews who had
come down from Jerusalem stood about
and laid many serious complaints against
Paul, which they could not prove,
8 while he answered for himself,
"Neither against the law of the Jews, nor
against the temple, nor against Caesar
have I oﬀended in anything at all."
9 But Festus, wan ng to do the Jews a
favor, answered Paul and said, "Are you
willing to go up to Jerusalem and there
be judged before me concerning these
things?"
10 So Paul said, "I stand at Caesar’s
judgment seat, where I ought to beACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
157
judged. To the Jews I have done no
wrong, as you very well know.
11 "For if I am an oﬀender, or have
commi ed anything deserving of death,
I do not object to dying; but if there is
nothing in these things of which these
men accuse me, no one can deliver me
to them. I appeal to Caesar."
12 Then Festus, when he had conferred
with the council, answered, "You have
appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall
go!"
13 And a er some days King Agrippa
and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet
Festus.
14 When they had been there many
days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the
king, saying: "There is a certain man le
a prisoner by Felix,
15 "about whom the chief priests and
the elders of the Jews informed me,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
158
when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a
judgment against him.
16 "To them I answered, ‘It is not the
custom of the Romans to deliver any
man to destruc on before the accused
meets the accusers face to face, and
has opportunity to answer for himself
concerning the charge against him.’
17 "Therefore when they had come
together, without any delay, the next
day I sat on the judgment seat and
commanded the man to be brought in.
18 "When the accusers stood up, they
brought no accusa on against him of
such things as I supposed,
19 "but had some ques ons against him
about their own religion and about a
certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul
aﬃrmed to be alive.
20 "And because I was uncertain of
such ques ons, I asked whether he wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
159
willing to go to Jerusalem and there be
judged concerning these ma ers.
21 "But when Paul appealed to be
reserved for the decision of Augustus, I
commanded him to be kept ll I could
send him to Caesar."
22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I also
would like to hear the man myself."
"Tomorrow, " he said, "you shall hear
him."
23 So the next day, when Agrippa and
Bernice had come with great pomp, and
had entered the auditorium with the
commanders and the prominent men of
the city, at Festus’ command Paul was
brought in.
24 And Festus said: "King Agrippa and
all the men who are here present with
us, you see this man about whom the
whole assembly of the Jews pe oned
me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying
out that he was not ﬁt to live any longer.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25 – 26 160
25 "But when I found that he had
commi ed nothing deserving of death,
and that he himself had appealed to
Augustus, I decided to send him.
26 "I have nothing certain to write to
my lord concerning him. Therefore I
have brought him out before you, and
especially before you, King Agrippa, so
that a er the examina on has taken
place I may have something to write.
27 "For it seems to me unreasonable to
send a prisoner and not to specify the
charges against him."
1 Then Agrippa said to Paul,
"You are permi ed to speak for
yourself." So Paul stretched out his hand
and answered for himself:
2 "I think myself happy, King Agrippa,
because today I shall answer for myself
before you concerning all the things of
which I am accused by the Jews,
26ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
161
3 "especially because you are expert in
all customs and ques ons which have to
do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to
hear me pa ently.
4 "My manner of life from my youth,
which was spent from the beginning
among my own na on at Jerusalem, all
the Jews know.
5 "They knew me from the ﬁrst, if they
were willing to tes fy, that according to
the strictest sect of our religion I lived a
Pharisee.
6 "And now I stand and am judged for
the hope of the promise made by God to
our fathers.
7 "To this promise our twelve tribes,
earnestly serving God night and day,
hope to a ain. For this hope’s sake, King
Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
8 "Why should it be thought incredible
by you that God raises the dead?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
162
9 "Indeed, I myself thought I must do
many things contrary to the name of
Jesus of Nazareth.
10 "This I also did in Jerusalem, and
many of the saints I shut up in prison,
having received authority from the chief
priests; and when they were put to
death, I cast my vote against them.
11 "And I punished them o en in
every synagogue and compelled them
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly
enraged against them, I persecuted
them even to foreign ci es.
12 "While thus occupied, as I journeyed
to Damascus with authority and
commission from the chief priests,
13 "at midday, O king, along the road I
saw a light from heaven, brighter than
the sun, shining around me and those
who journeyed with me.
14 "And when we all had fallen to the
ground, I heard a voice speaking to meACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
163
and saying in the Hebrew language,
‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecu ng
Me? It is hard for you to kick against the
goads.’
15 "So I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And
He said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are
persecu ng.
16 ‘But rise and stand on your feet; for I
have appeared to you for this purpose,
to make you a minister and a witness
both of the things which you have seen
and of the things which I will yet reveal
to you.
17 ‘I will deliver you from the Jewish
people, as well as from the Gen les, to
whom I now send you,
18 ‘to open their eyes, in order to turn
them from darkness to light, and from
the power of Satan to God, that they
may receive forgiveness of sins and
an inheritance among those who are
sanc ﬁed by faith in Me.’ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
164
19 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not
disobedient to the heavenly vision,
20 "but declared ﬁrst to those in
Damascus and in Jerusalem, and
throughout all the region of Judea, and
then to the Gen les, that they should
repent, turn to God, and do works
beﬁ ng repentance.
21 "For these reasons the Jews seized
me in the temple and tried to kill me.
22 "Therefore, having obtained help
from God, to this day I stand, witnessing
both to small and great, saying no other
things than those which the prophets
and Moses said would come––
23 "that the Christ would suﬀer, that He
would be the ﬁrst to rise from the dead,
and would proclaim light to the Jewish
people and to the Gen les."
24 Now as he thus made his defense,
Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, youACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
165
are beside yourself! Much learning is
driving you mad!"
25 But he said, "I am not mad, most
noble Festus, but speak the words of
truth and reason.
26 "For the king, before whom I also
speak freely, knows these things; for I
am convinced that none of these things
escapes his a en on, since this thing
was not done in a corner.
27 "King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know that you do believe."
28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You
almost persuade me to become a
Chris an."
29 And Paul said, "I would to God that
not only you, but also all who hear me
today, might become both almost and
altogether such as I am, except for these
chains."
30 When he had said these things, the
king stood up, as well as the governorACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26 – 27 166
and Bernice and those who sat with
them;
31 and when they had gone aside, they
talked among themselves, saying, "This
man is doing nothing deserving of death
or chains."
32 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "This
man might have been set free if he had
not appealed to Caesar."
1 And when it was decided that
we should sail to Italy, they
delivered Paul and some other prisoners
to one named Julius, a centurion of the
Augustan Regiment.
2 So, entering a ship of Adramy um,
we put to sea, meaning to sail along
the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a
Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with
us.
3 And the next day we landed at Sidon.
And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave
27ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
167
him liberty to go to his friends and
receive care.
4 When we had put to sea from there,
we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus,
because the winds were contrary.
5 And when we had sailed over the sea
which is oﬀ Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
6 There the centurion found an
Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he
put us on board.
7 When we had sailed slowly many
days, and arrived with diﬃculty oﬀ
Cnidus, the wind not permi ng us to
proceed, we sailed under the shelter of
Crete oﬀ Salmone.
8 Passing it with diﬃculty, we came to a
place called Fair Havens, near the city of
Lasea.
9 Now when much me had been
spent, and sailing was now dangerousACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
168
because the Fast was already over, Paul
advised them,
10 saying, "Men, I perceive that this
voyage will end with disaster and much
loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but
also our lives."
11 Nevertheless the centurion was
more persuaded by the helmsman and
the owner of the ship than by the things
spoken by Paul.
12 And because the harbor was not
suitable to winter in, the majority
advised to set sail from there also, if by
any means they could reach Phoenix,
a harbor of Crete opening toward the
southwest and northwest, and winter
there.
13 When the south wind blew so ly,
supposing that they had obtained their
desire, pu ng out to sea, they sailed
close by Crete.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
14 But not long a
169
er, a tempestuous
head wind arose, called Euroclydon.
15 So when the ship was caught, and
could not head into the wind, we let her
drive.
16 And running under the shelter of an
island called Clauda, we secured the skiﬀ
with diﬃculty.
17 When they had taken it on board,
they used cables to undergird the ship;
and fearing lest they should run aground
on the Syr s Sands, they struck sail and
so were driven.
18 And because we were exceedingly
tempest–tossed, the next day they
lightened the ship.
19 On the third day we threw the ship’s
tackle overboard with our own hands.
20 Now when neither sun nor stars
appeared for many days, and no small
tempest beat on us, all hope that we
would be saved was ﬁnally given up.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
21 But a
170
er long abs nence from food,
then Paul stood in the midst of them and
said, "Men, you should have listened to
me, and not have sailed from Crete and
incurred this disaster and loss.
22 "And now I urge you to take heart,
for there will be no loss of life among
you, but only of the ship.
23 "For there stood by me this night an
angel of the God to whom I belong and
whom I serve,
24 "saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you
must be brought before Caesar; and
indeed God has granted you all those
who sail with you.’
25 "Therefore take heart, men, for I
believe God that it will be just as it was
told me.
26 "However, we must run aground on a
certain island."
27 Now when the fourteenth night had
come, as we were driven up and downACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
171
in the Adria c Sea, about midnight the
sailors sensed that they were drawing
near some land.
28 And they took soundings and found
it to be twenty fathoms; and when
they had gone a li le farther, they took
soundings again and found it to be
ﬁ een fathoms.
29 Then, fearing lest we should run
aground on the rocks, they dropped four
anchors from the stern, and prayed for
day to come.
30 And as the sailors were seeking to
escape from the ship, when they had
let down the skiﬀ into the sea, under
pretense of pu ng out anchors from the
prow,
31 Paul said to the centurion and the
soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the
ship, you cannot be saved."
32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes
of the skiﬀ and let it fall oﬀ.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
172
33 And as day was about to dawn, Paul
implored them all to take food, saying,
"Today is the fourteenth day you have
waited and con nued without food, and
eaten nothing.
34 "Therefore I urge you to take
nourishment, for this is for your survival,
since not a hair will fall from the head of
any of you."
35 And when he had said these things,
he took bread and gave thanks to God in
the presence of them all; and when he
had broken it he began to eat.
36 Then they were all encouraged, and
also took food themselves.
37 And in all we were two hundred and
seventy–six persons on the ship.
38 So when they had eaten enough,
they lightened the ship and threw out
the wheat into the sea.
39 When it was day, they did not
recognize the land; but they observedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
173
a bay with a beach, onto which they
planned to run the ship if possible.
40 And they let go the anchors and le
them in the sea, meanwhile loosing
the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the
mainsail to the wind and made for shore.
41 But striking a place where two
seas met, they ran the ship aground;
and the prow stuck fast and remained
immovable, but the stern was being
broken up by the violence of the waves.
42 And the soldiers’ plan was to kill the
prisoners, lest any of them should swim
away and escape.
43 But the centurion, wan ng to save
Paul, kept them from their purpose, and
commanded that those who could swim
should jump overboard ﬁrst and get to
land,
44 and the rest, some on boards and
some on parts of the ship. And so it was
that they all escaped safely to land.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
28
174
1 Now when they had escaped,
they then found out that the
island was called Malta.
2 And the na ves showed us unusual
kindness; for they kindled a ﬁre and
made us all welcome, because of the
rain that was falling and because of the
cold.
3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle
of s cks and laid them on the ﬁre, a
viper came out because of the heat, and
fastened on his hand.
4 So when the na ves saw the creature
hanging from his hand, they said to
one another, "No doubt this man is a
murderer, whom, though he has escaped
the sea, yet jus ce does not allow to
live."
5 But he shook oﬀ the creature into the
ﬁre and suﬀered no harm.
6 However, they were expec ng that he
would swell up or suddenly fall downACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
175
dead. But a er they had looked for a
long me and saw no harm come to him,
they changed their minds and said that
he was a god.
7 In that region there was an estate of
the leading ci zen of the island, whose
name was Publius, who received us and
entertained us courteously for three
days.
8 And it happened that the father of
Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery.
Paul went in to him and prayed, and he
laid his hands on him and healed him.
9 So when this was done, the rest of
those on the island who had diseases
also came and were healed.
10 They also honored us in many ways;
and when we departed, they provided
such things as were necessary.
11 A er three months we sailed in an
Alexandrian ship whose ﬁgurehead wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
176
the Twin Brothers, which had wintered
at the island.
12 And landing at Syracuse, we stayed
three days.
13 From there we circled round and
reached Rhegium. And a er one day the
south wind blew; and the next day we
came to Puteoli,
14 where we found brethren, and were
invited to stay with them seven days.
And so we went toward Rome.
15 And from there, when the brethren
heard about us, they came to meet us
as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns.
When Paul saw them, he thanked God
and took courage.
16 Now when we came to Rome, the
centurion delivered the prisoners to
the captain of the guard; but Paul was
permi ed to dwell by himself with the
soldier who guarded him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
17 And it came to pass a
177
er three
days that Paul called the leaders of the
Jews together. So when they had come
together, he said to them: "Men and
brethren, though I have done nothing
against our people or the customs of our
fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner
from Jerusalem into the hands of the
Romans,
18 "who, when they had examined me,
wanted to let me go, because there was
no cause for pu ng me to death.
19 "But when the Jews spoke against it,
I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not
that I had anything of which to accuse
my na on.
20 "For this reason therefore I have
called for you, to see you and speak with
you, because for the hope of Israel I am
bound with this chain."
21 Then they said to him, "We neither
received le ers from Judea concerningACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
178
you, nor have any of the brethren who
came reported or spoken any evil of you.
22 "But we desire to hear from you
what you think; for concerning this
sect, we know that it is spoken against
everywhere."
23 So when they had appointed him a
day, many came to him at his lodging,
to whom he explained and solemnly
tes ﬁed of the kingdom of God,
persuading them concerning Jesus from
both the Law of Moses and the Prophets,
from morning ll evening.
24 And some were persuaded by the
things which were spoken, and some
disbelieved.
25 So when they did not agree among
themselves, they departed a er Paul
had said one word: "The Holy Spirit
spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet
to our fathers,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
179
26 "saying, ‘Go to this people and say:
"Hearing you will hear, and shall not
understand; And seeing you will see, and
not perceive;
27 For the hearts of this people have
grown dull. Their ears are hard of
hearing, And their eyes they have closed,
Lest they should see with their eyes and
hear with their ears, Lest they should
understand with their hearts and turn,
So that I should heal them."’
28 "Therefore let it be known to you
that the salva on of God has been sent
to the Gen les, and they will hear it!"
29 And when he had said these words,
the Jews departed and had a great
dispute among themselves.
30 Then Paul dwelt two whole years in
his own rented house, and received all
who came to him,
31 preaching the kingdom of God and
teaching the things which concern theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
180
Lord Jesus Christ with all conﬁdence, no
one forbidding him.Romans
1
1 Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ,
called to be an apostle, separated to
the gospel of God
2 which He promised before through
His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,
3 concerning His Son Jesus Christ our
Lord, who was born of the seed of David
according to the ﬂesh,
4 and declared to be the Son of God
with power according to the Spirit of
holiness, by the resurrec on from the
dead.
5 Through Him we have received grace
and apostleship for obedience to the
faith among all na ons for His name,
6 among whom you also are the called
of Jesus Christ;ROMANS 1
2
7 To all who are in Rome, beloved of
God, called to be saints: Grace to you
and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.
8 First, I thank my God through Jesus
Christ for you all, that your faith is
spoken of throughout the whole world.
9 For God is my witness, whom I serve
with my spirit in the gospel of His Son,
that without ceasing I make men on of
you always in my prayers,
10 making request if, by some means,
now at last I may ﬁnd a way in the will of
God to come to you.
11 For I long to see you, that I may
impart to you some spiritual gi , so that
you may be established––
12 that is, that I may be encouraged
together with you by the mutual faith
both of you and me.
13 Now I do not want you to be
unaware, brethren, that I o en plannedROMANS 1
3
to come to you (but was hindered un l
now), that I might have some fruit
among you also, just as among the other
Gen les.
14 I am a debtor both to Greeks and to
barbarians, both to wise and to unwise.
15 So, as much as is in me, I am ready
to preach the gospel to you who are in
Rome also.
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel
of Christ, for it is the power of God to
salva on for everyone who believes, for
the Jew ﬁrst and also for the Greek.
17 For in it the righteousness of God
is revealed from faith to faith; as it is
wri en, "The just shall live by faith."
18 For the wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, who suppress
the truth in unrighteousness,ROMANS 1
4
19 because what may be known of God
is manifest in them, for God has shown
it to them.
20 For since the crea on of the world
His invisible a ributes are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that
are made, even His eternal power and
Godhead, so that they are without
excuse,
21 because, although they knew God,
they did not glorify Him as God, nor
were thankful, but became fu le in their
thoughts, and their foolish hearts were
darkened.
22 Professing to be wise, they became
fools,
23 and changed the glory of the
incorrup ble God into an image made
like corrup ble man––and birds and
four–footed animals and creeping
things.ROMANS 1
5
24 Therefore God also gave them up
to uncleanness, in the lusts of their
hearts, to dishonor their bodies among
themselves,
25 who exchanged the truth of God for
the lie, and worshiped and served the
creature rather than the Creator, who is
blessed forever. Amen.
26 For this reason God gave them up
to vile passions. For even their women
exchanged the natural use for what is
against nature.
27 Likewise also the men, leaving the
natural use of the woman, burned in
their lust for one another, men with
men commi ng what is shameful, and
receiving in themselves the penalty of
their error which was due.
28 And even as they did not like to retain
God in their knowledge, God gave them
over to a debased mind, to do those
things which are not ﬁ ng;ROMANS 1 – 2
6
29 being ﬁlled with all unrighteousness,
sexual immorality, wickedness,
covetousness, maliciousness; full of
envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil–
mindedness; they are whisperers,
30 backbiters, haters of God, violent,
proud, boasters, inventors of evil things,
disobedient to parents,
31 undiscerning, untrustworthy,
unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful;
32 who, knowing the righteous
judgment of God, that those who
prac ce such things are deserving of
death, not only do the same but also
approve of those who prac ce them.
1 Therefore you are inexcusable, O
man, whoever you are who judge,
for in whatever you judge another you
condemn yourself; for you who judge
prac ce the same things.
2ROMANS 2
7
2 But we know that the judgment of
God is according to truth against those
who prac ce such things.
3 And do you think this, O man, you
who judge those prac cing such things,
and doing the same, that you will escape
the judgment of God?
4 Or do you despise the riches of
His goodness, forbearance, and
longsuﬀering, not knowing that
the goodness of God leads you to
repentance?
5 But in accordance with your hardness
and your impenitent heart you are
treasuring up for yourself wrath in
the day of wrath and revela on of the
righteous judgment of God,
6 who "will render to each one
according to his deeds":
7 eternal life to those who by pa ent
con nuance in doing good seek for glory,
honor, and immortality;ROMANS 2
8
8 but to those who are self–seeking
and do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness––indigna on and
wrath,
9 tribula on and anguish, on every soul
of man who does evil, of the Jew ﬁrst
and also of the Greek;
10 but glory, honor, and peace to
everyone who works what is good, to
the Jew ﬁrst and also to the Greek.
11 For there is no par ality with God.
12 For as many as have sinned without
law will also perish without law, and as
many as have sinned in the law will be
judged by the law
13 (for not the hearers of the law are
just in the sight of God, but the doers of
the law will be jus ﬁed;
14 for when Gen les, who do not have
the law, by nature do the things in the
law, these, although not having the law,
are a law to themselves,ROMANS 2
9
15 who show the work of the law
wri en in their hearts, their conscience
also bearing witness, and between
themselves their thoughts accusing or
else excusing them)
16 in the day when God will judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according
to my gospel.
17 Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest
on the law, and make your boast in God,
18 and know His will, and approve
the things that are excellent, being
instructed out of the law,
19 and are conﬁdent that you yourself
are a guide to the blind, a light to those
who are in darkness,
20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher
of babes, having the form of knowledge
and truth in the law.
21 You, therefore, who teach another,
do you not teach yourself? You whoROMANS 2
10
preach that a man should not steal, do
you steal?
22 You who say, "Do not commit
adultery," do you commit adultery? You
who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
23 You who make your boast in the law,
do you dishonor God through breaking
the law?
24 For "the name of God is blasphemed
among the Gen les because of you," as
it is wri en.
25 For circumcision is indeed proﬁtable
if you keep the law; but if you are a
breaker of the law, your circumcision has
become uncircumcision.
26 Therefore, if an uncircumcised man
keeps the righteous requirements of
the law, will not his uncircumcision be
counted as circumcision?
27 And will not the physically
uncircumcised, if he fulﬁlls the law, judge
you who, even with your wri en codeROMANS 2 – 3
11
and circumcision, are a transgressor of
the law?
28 For he is not a Jew who is one
outwardly, nor is circumcision that which
is outward in the ﬂesh;
29 but he is a Jew who is one inwardly;
and circumcision is that of the heart, in
the Spirit, not in the le er; whose praise
is not from men but from God.
1 What advantage then has the Jew,
or what is the proﬁt of circumcision?
2 Much in every way! Chieﬂy because
to them were commi ed the oracles of
God.
3 For what if some did not believe? Will
their unbelief make the faithfulness of
God without eﬀect?
4 Certainly not! Indeed, let God be true
but every man a liar. As it is wri en:
"That You may be jus ﬁed in Your
words, And may overcome when You are
judged."
3ROMANS 3
12
5 But if our unrighteousness
demonstrates the righteousness of
God, what shall we say? Is God unjust
who inﬂicts wrath? (I speak as a man.)
6 Certainly not! For then how will God
judge the world?
7 For if the truth of God has increased
through my lie to His glory, why am I also
s ll judged as a sinner?
8 And why not say, "Let us do evil
that good may come"? ––as we are
slanderously reported and as some
aﬃrm that we say. Their condemna on
is just.
9 What then? Are we be er than
they? Not at all. For we have previously
charged both Jews and Greeks that they
are all under sin.
10 As it is wri en: "There is none
righteous, no, not one;
11 There is none who understands;
There is none who seeks a er God.ROMANS 3
13
12 They have all turned aside; They have
together become unproﬁtable; There is
none who does good, no, not one."
13 "Their throat is an open tomb;
With their tongues they have prac ced
deceit"; "The poison of asps is under
their lips";
14 "Whose mouth is full of cursing and
bi erness."
15 "Their feet are swi to shed blood;
16 Destruc on and misery are in their
ways;
17 And the way of peace they have not
known."
18 "There is no fear of God before their
eyes."
19 Now we know that whatever the law
says, it says to those who are under the
law, that every mouth may be stopped,
and all the world may become guilty
before God.ROMANS 3
14
20 Therefore by the deeds of the law no
ﬂesh will be jus ﬁed in His sight, for by
the law is the knowledge of sin.
21 But now the righteousness of God
apart from the law is revealed, being
witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
22 even the righteousness of God,
through faith in Jesus Christ, to all
and on all who believe. For there is no
diﬀerence;
23 for all have sinned and fall short of
the glory of God,
24 being jus ﬁed freely by His grace
through the redemp on that is in Christ
Jesus,
25 whom God set forth as a propi a on
by His blood, through faith, to
demonstrate His righteousness, because
in His forbearance God had passed over
the sins that were previously commi ed,
26 to demonstrate at the present me
His righteousness, that He might be justROMANS 3 – 4
15
and the jus ﬁer of the one who has faith
in Jesus.
27 Where is boas ng then? It is
excluded. By what law? Of works? No,
but by the law of faith.
28 Therefore we conclude that a man is
jus ﬁed by faith apart from the deeds of
the law.
29 Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is
He not also the God of the Gen les? Yes,
of the Gen les also,
30 since there is one God who will
jus fy the circumcised by faith and the
uncircumcised through faith.
31 Do we then make void the law
through faith? Certainly not! On the
contrary, we establish the law.
1 What then shall we say that
Abraham our father has found
according to the ﬂesh?
4ROMANS 4
2 For if Abraham was jus
16
ﬁed by works,
he has something to boast about, but
not before God.
3 For what does the Scripture say?
"Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for righteousness."
4 Now to him who works, the wages are
not counted as grace but as debt.
5 But to him who does not work
but believes on Him who jus ﬁes the
ungodly, his faith is accounted for
righteousness,
6 just as David also describes the
blessedness of the man to whom God
imputes righteousness apart from works:
7 "Blessed are those whose lawless
deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are
covered;
8 Blessed is the man to whom the LORD
shall not impute sin."
9 Does this blessedness then come
upon the circumcised only, or upon theROMANS 4
17
uncircumcised also? For we say that
faith was accounted to Abraham for
righteousness.
10 How then was it accounted? While
he was circumcised, or uncircumcised?
Not while circumcised, but while
uncircumcised.
11 And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
of the faith which he had while s ll
uncircumcised, that he might be
the father of all those who believe,
though they are uncircumcised, that
righteousness might be imputed to them
also,
12 and the father of circumcision
to those who not only are of the
circumcision, but who also walk in
the steps of the faith which our father
Abraham had while s ll uncircumcised.
13 For the promise that he would be the
heir of the world was not to Abraham orROMANS 4
18
to his seed through the law, but through
the righteousness of faith.
14 For if those who are of the law are
heirs, faith is made void and the promise
made of no eﬀect,
15 because the law brings about wrath;
for where there is no law there is no
transgression.
16 Therefore it is of faith that it might be
according to grace, so that the promise
might be sure to all the seed, not only
to those who are of the law, but also to
those who are of the faith of Abraham,
who is the father of us all
17 (as it is wri en, "I have made you a
father of many na ons") in the presence
of Him whom he believed––God, who
gives life to the dead and calls those
things which do not exist as though they
did;
18 who, contrary to hope, in hope
believed, so that he became the fatherROMANS 4
19
of many na ons, according to what was
spoken, "So shall your descendants be."
19 And not being weak in faith, he did
not consider his own body, already dead
(since he was about a hundred years
old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.
20 He did not waver at the promise
of God through unbelief, but was
strengthened in faith, giving glory to
God,
21 and being fully convinced that what
He had promised He was also able to
perform.
22 And therefore "it was accounted to
him for righteousness."
23 Now it was not wri en for his sake
alone that it was imputed to him,
24 but also for us. It shall be imputed
to us who believe in Him who raised up
Jesus our Lord from the dead,ROMANS 4 – 5
20
25 who was delivered up because of our
oﬀenses, and was raised because of our
jus ﬁca on.
1 Therefore, having been jus ﬁed
by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
2 through whom also we have access by
faith into this grace in which we stand,
and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
3 And not only that, but we also glory
in tribula ons, knowing that tribula on
produces perseverance;
4 and perseverance, character; and
character, hope.
5 Now hope does not disappoint,
because the love of God has been
poured out in our hearts by the Holy
Spirit who was given to us.
6 For when we were s ll without
strength, in due me Christ died for the
ungodly.
5ROMANS 5
21
7 For scarcely for a righteous man will
one die; yet perhaps for a good man
someone would even dare to die.
8 But God demonstrates His own love
toward us, in that while we were s ll
sinners, Christ died for us.
9 Much more then, having now been
jus ﬁed by His blood, we shall be saved
from wrath through Him.
10 For if when we were enemies we
were reconciled to God through the
death of His Son, much more, having
been reconciled, we shall be saved by
His life.
11 And not only that, but we also rejoice
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have now received
the reconcilia on.
12 Therefore, just as through one
man sin entered the world, and death
through sin, and thus death spread to all
men, because all sinned––ROMANS 5
13 (For un
22
l the law sin was in the
world, but sin is not imputed when there
is no law.
14 Nevertheless death reigned from
Adam to Moses, even over those who
had not sinned according to the likeness
of the transgression of Adam, who is a
type of Him who was to come.
15 But the free gi is not like the
oﬀense. For if by the one man’s oﬀense
many died, much more the grace of God
and the gi by the grace of the one Man,
Jesus Christ, abounded to many.
16 And the gi is not like that which
came through the one who sinned. For
the judgment which came from one
oﬀense resulted in condemna on, but
the free gi which came from many
oﬀenses resulted in jus ﬁca on.
17 For if by the one man’s oﬀense death
reigned through the one, much more
those who receive abundance of graceROMANS 5 – 6
23
and of the gi of righteousness will reign
in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)
18 Therefore, as through one man’s
oﬀense judgment came to all men,
resul ng in condemna on, even so
through one Man’s righteous act the
free gi came to all men, resul ng in
jus ﬁca on of life.
19 For as by one man’s disobedience
many were made sinners, so also by one
Man’s obedience many will be made
righteous.
20 Moreover the law entered that the
oﬀense might abound. But where sin
abounded, grace abounded much more,
21 so that as sin reigned in death,
even so grace might reign through
righteousness to eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 What shall we say then? Shall
we con nue in sin that grace may
abound?
6ROMANS 6
24
2 Certainly not! How shall we who died
to sin live any longer in it?
3 Or do you not know that as many of us
as were bap zed into Christ Jesus were
bap zed into His death?
4 Therefore we were buried with Him
through bap sm into death, that just
as Christ was raised from the dead by
the glory of the Father, even so we also
should walk in newness of life.
5 For if we have been united together
in the likeness of His death, certainly
we also shall be in the likeness of His
resurrec on,
6 knowing this, that our old man was
cruciﬁed with Him, that the body of
sin might be done away with, that we
should no longer be slaves of sin.
7 For he who has died has been freed
from sin.
8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe
that we shall also live with Him,ROMANS 6
25
9 knowing that Christ, having been
raised from the dead, dies no more.
Death no longer has dominion over Him.
10 For the death that He died, He died
to sin once for all; but the life that He
lives, He lives to God.
11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves
to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to
God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your
mortal body, that you should obey it in
its lusts.
13 And do not present your members as
instruments of unrighteousness to sin,
but present yourselves to God as being
alive from the dead, and your members
as instruments of righteousness to God.
14 For sin shall not have dominion over
you, for you are not under law but under
grace.ROMANS 6
26
15 What then? Shall we sin because
we are not under law but under grace?
Certainly not!
16 Do you not know that to whom you
present yourselves slaves to obey, you
are that one’s slaves whom you obey,
whether of sin leading to death, or of
obedience leading to righteousness?
17 But God be thanked that though you
were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from
the heart that form of doctrine to which
you were delivered.
18 And having been set free from sin,
you became slaves of righteousness.
19 I speak in human terms because of
the weakness of your ﬂesh. For just as
you presented your members as slaves
of uncleanness, and of lawlessness
leading to more lawlessness, so now
present your members as slaves of
righteousness for holiness.ROMANS 6 – 7
27
20 For when you were slaves of sin, you
were free in regard to righteousness.
21 What fruit did you have then in the
things of which you are now ashamed?
For the end of those things is death.
22 But now having been set free from
sin, and having become slaves of God,
you have your fruit to holiness, and the
end, everlas ng life.
23 For the wages of sin is death, but the
gi of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus
our Lord.
1 Or do you not know, brethren (for
I speak to those who know the law),
that the law has dominion over a man as
long as he lives?
2 For the woman who has a husband is
bound by the law to her husband as long
as he lives. But if the husband dies, she
is released from the law of her husband.
3 So then if, while her husband lives, she
marries another man, she will be called
7ROMANS 7
28
an adulteress; but if her husband dies,
she is free from that law, so that she is
no adulteress, though she has married
another man.
4 Therefore, my brethren, you also have
become dead to the law through the
body of Christ, that you may be married
to another––to Him who was raised
from the dead, that we should bear fruit
to God.
5 For when we were in the ﬂesh, the
sinful passions which were aroused by
the law were at work in our members to
bear fruit to death.
6 But now we have been delivered from
the law, having died to what we were
held by, so that we should serve in the
newness of the Spirit and not in the
oldness of the le er.
7 What shall we say then? Is the law
sin? Certainly not! On the contrary,
I would not have known sin exceptROMANS 7
29
through the law. For I would not have
known covetousness unless the law had
said, "You shall not covet."
8 But sin, taking opportunity by the
commandment, produced in me all
manner of evil desire. For apart from the
law sin was dead.
9 I was alive once without the law, but
when the commandment came, sin
revived and I died.
10 And the commandment, which was
to bring life, I found to bring death.
11 For sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, deceived me, and by it
killed me.
12 Therefore the law is holy, and the
commandment holy and just and good.
13 Has then what is good become death
to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it
might appear sin, was producing death
in me through what is good, so thatROMANS 7
30
sin through the commandment might
become exceedingly sinful.
14 For we know that the law is spiritual,
but I am carnal, sold under sin.
15 For what I am doing, I do not
understand. For what I will to do, that I
do not prac ce; but what I hate, that I
do.
16 If, then, I do what I will not to do, I
agree with the law that it is good.
17 But now, it is no longer I who do it,
but sin that dwells in me.
18 For I know that in me (that is, in my
ﬂesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is
present with me, but how to perform
what is good I do not ﬁnd.
19 For the good that I will to do, I do not
do; but the evil I will not to do, that I
prac ce.
20 Now if I do what I will not to do, it is
no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells
in me.ROMANS 7 – 8
31
21 I ﬁnd then a law, that evil is present
with me, the one who wills to do good.
22 For I delight in the law of God
according to the inward man.
23 But I see another law in my members,
warring against the law of my mind, and
bringing me into cap vity to the law of
sin which is in my members.
24 O wretched man that I am! Who will
deliver me from this body of death?
25 I thank God––through Jesus Christ
our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself
serve the law of God, but with the ﬂesh
the law of sin.
1 There is therefore now no
condemna on to those who are in
Christ Jesus, who do not walk according
to the ﬂesh, but according to the Spirit.
2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has made me free from the law of
sin and death.
8ROMANS 8
32
3 For what the law could not do in that
it was weak through the ﬂesh, God did
by sending His own Son in the likeness
of sinful ﬂesh, on account of sin: He
condemned sin in the ﬂesh,
4 that the righteous requirement of the
law might be fulﬁlled in us who do not
walk according to the ﬂesh but according
to the Spirit.
5 For those who live according to the
ﬂesh set their minds on the things of the
ﬂesh, but those who live according to
the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
6 For to be carnally minded is death, but
to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
7 Because the carnal mind is enmity
against God; for it is not subject to the
law of God, nor indeed can be.
8 So then, those who are in the ﬂesh
cannot please God.
9 But you are not in the ﬂesh but in the
Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwellsROMANS 8
33
in you. Now if anyone does not have the
Spirit of Christ, he is not His.
10 And if Christ is in you, the body is
dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life
because of righteousness.
11 But if the Spirit of Him who raised
Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He
who raised Christ from the dead will also
give life to your mortal bodies through
His Spirit who dwells in you.
12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors–
–not to the ﬂesh, to live according to the
ﬂesh.
13 For if you live according to the ﬂesh
you will die; but if by the Spirit you put
to death the deeds of the body, you will
live.
14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of
God, these are sons of God.
15 For you did not receive the spirit of
bondage again to fear, but you receivedROMANS 8
34
the Spirit of adop on by whom we cry
out, "Abba, Father."
16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with
our spirit that we are children of God,
17 and if children, then heirs––heirs of
God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed
we suﬀer with Him, that we may also be
gloriﬁed together.
18 For I consider that the suﬀerings of
this present me are not worthy to be
compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us.
19 For the earnest expecta on of the
crea on eagerly waits for the revealing
of the sons of God.
20 For the crea on was subjected to
fu lity, not willingly, but because of Him
who subjected it in hope;
21 because the crea on itself also
will be delivered from the bondage of
corrup on into the glorious liberty of
the children of God.ROMANS 8
22 For we know that the whole crea
35
on
groans and labors with birth pangs
together un l now.
23 Not only that, but we also who
have the ﬁrs ruits of the Spirit, even
we ourselves groan within ourselves,
eagerly wai ng for the adop on, the
redemp on of our body.
24 For we were saved in this hope, but
hope that is seen is not hope; for why
does one s ll hope for what he sees?
25 But if we hope for what we do
not see, we eagerly wait for it with
perseverance.
26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our
weaknesses. For we do not know what
we should pray for as we ought, but the
Spirit Himself makes intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be u ered.
27 Now He who searches the hearts
knows what the mind of the Spirit is,ROMANS 8
36
because He makes intercession for the
saints according to the will of God.
28 And we know that all things work
together for good to those who love God,
to those who are the called according to
His purpose.
29 For whom He foreknew, He also
predes ned to be conformed to the
image of His Son, that He might be the
ﬁrstborn among many brethren.
30 Moreover whom He predes ned,
these He also called; whom He called,
these He also jus ﬁed; and whom He
jus ﬁed, these He also gloriﬁed.
31 What then shall we say to these
things? If God is for us, who can be
against us?
32 He who did not spare His own Son,
but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
He not with Him also freely give us all
things?ROMANS 8
37
33 Who shall bring a charge against
God’s elect? It is God who jus ﬁes.
34 Who is he who condemns? It is Christ
who died, and furthermore is also risen,
who is even at the right hand of God,
who also makes intercession for us.
35 Who shall separate us from the love
of Christ? Shall tribula on, or distress, or
persecu on, or famine, or nakedness, or
peril, or sword?
36 As it is wri en: "For Your sake we are
killed all day long; We are accounted as
sheep for the slaughter."
37 Yet in all these things we are more
than conquerors through Him who loved
us.
38 For I am persuaded that neither death
nor life, nor angels nor principali es nor
powers, nor things present nor things to
come,
39 nor height nor depth, nor any other
created thing, shall be able to separateROMANS 9
38
us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.
1 I tell the truth in Christ, I am not
lying, my conscience also bearing me
witness in the Holy Spirit,
2 that I have great sorrow and con nual
grief in my heart.
3 For I could wish that I myself were
accursed from Christ for my brethren,
my countrymen according to the ﬂesh,
4 who are Israelites, to whom pertain
the adop on, the glory, the covenants,
the giving of the law, the service of God,
and the promises;
5 of whom are the fathers and from
whom, according to the ﬂesh, Christ
came, who is over all, the eternally
blessed God. Amen.
6 But it is not that the word of God has
taken no eﬀect. For they are not all Israel
who are of Israel,
9ROMANS 9
39
7 nor are they all children because they
are the seed of Abraham; but, "In Isaac
your seed shall be called."
8 That is, those who are the children of
the ﬂesh, these are not the children of
God; but the children of the promise are
counted as the seed.
9 For this is the word of promise: "At
this me I will come and Sarah shall have
a son."
10 And not only this, but when Rebecca
also had conceived by one man, even by
our father Isaac
11 (for the children not yet being born,
nor having done any good or evil, that
the purpose of God according to elec on
might stand, not of works but of Him
who calls),
12 it was said to her, "The older shall
serve the younger."
13 As it is wri en, "Jacob I have loved,
but Esau I have hated."ROMANS 9
40
14 What shall we say then? Is there
unrighteousness with God? Certainly
not!
15 For He says to Moses, "I will have
mercy on whomever I will have mercy,
and I will have compassion on whomever
I will have compassion."
16 So then it is not of him who wills, nor
of him who runs, but of God who shows
mercy.
17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh,
"For this very purpose I have raised you
up, that I may show My power in you,
and that My name may be declared in all
the earth."
18 Therefore He has mercy on whom He
wills, and whom He wills He hardens.
19 You will say to me then, "Why does
He s ll ﬁnd fault? For who has resisted
His will?"
20 But indeed, O man, who are you to
reply against God? Will the thing formedROMANS 9
41
say to him who formed it, "Why have
you made me like this?"
21 Does not the po er have power over
the clay, from the same lump to make
one vessel for honor and another for
dishonor?
22 What if God, wan ng to show His
wrath and to make His power known,
endured with much longsuﬀering
the vessels of wrath prepared for
destruc on,
23 and that He might make known
the riches of His glory on the vessels
of mercy, which He had prepared
beforehand for glory,
24 even us whom He called, not of the
Jews only, but also of the Gen les?
25 As He says also in Hosea: "I will call
them My people, who were not My
people, And her beloved, who was not
beloved."ROMANS 9
42
26 "And it shall come to pass in the
place where it was said to them, ‘You
are not My people,’ There they shall be
called sons of the living God."
27 Isaiah also cries out concerning
Israel: "Though the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the
sea, The remnant will be saved.
28 For He will ﬁnish the work and cut
it short in righteousness, Because the
LORD will make a short work upon the
earth."
29 And as Isaiah said before: "Unless the
LORD of Sabaoth had le us a seed, We
would have become like Sodom, And we
would have been made like Gomorrah."
30 What shall we say then? That
Gen les, who did not pursue
righteousness, have a ained to
righteousness, even the righteousness
of faith;ROMANS 9 – 10
43
31 but Israel, pursuing the law of
righteousness, has not a ained to the
law of righteousness.
32 Why? Because they did not seek it by
faith, but as it were, by the works of the
law. For they stumbled at that stumbling
stone.
33 As it is wri en: "Behold, I lay in Zion
a stumbling stone and rock of oﬀense,
And whoever believes on Him will not be
put to shame."
1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and
prayer to God for Israel is that
they may be saved.
2 For I bear them witness that they
have a zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge.
3 For they being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and seeking to establish
their own righteousness, have not
submi ed to the righteousness of God.
10ROMANS 10
44
4 For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to everyone who believes.
5 For Moses writes about the
righteousness which is of the law, "The
man who does those things shall live by
them."
6 But the righteousness of faith speaks
in this way, "Do not say in your heart,
‘Who will ascend into heaven?’" (that is,
to bring Christ down from above)
7 or, "‘Who will descend into the
abyss?’" (that is, to bring Christ up from
the dead).
8 But what does it say? "The word is
near you, in your mouth and in your
heart" (that is, the word of faith which
we preach):
9 that if you confess with your mouth
the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart
that God has raised Him from the dead,
you will be saved.ROMANS 10
45
10 For with the heart one believes unto
righteousness, and with the mouth
confession is made unto salva on.
11 For the Scripture says, "Whoever
believes on Him will not be put to
shame."
12 For there is no dis nc on between
Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over
all is rich to all who call upon Him.
13 For "whoever calls on the name of
the LORD shall be saved."
14 How then shall they call on Him in
whom they have not believed? And how
shall they believe in Him of whom they
have not heard? And how shall they hear
without a preacher?
15 And how shall they preach unless
they are sent? As it is wri en: "How
beau ful are the feet of those who
preach the gospel of peace, Who bring
glad dings of good things!"ROMANS 10
46
16 But they have not all obeyed the
gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has
believed our report?"
17 So then faith comes by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God.
18 But I say, have they not heard? Yes
indeed: "Their sound has gone out to all
the earth, And their words to the ends
of the world."
19 But I say, did Israel not know? First
Moses says: "I will provoke you to
jealousy by those who are not a na on,
I will move you to anger by a foolish
na on."
20 But Isaiah is very bold and says: "I
was found by those who did not seek
Me; I was made manifest to those who
did not ask for Me."
21 But to Israel he says: "All day long
I have stretched out My hands To a
disobedient and contrary people."ROMANS 11
11
47
1 I say then, has God cast away His
people? Certainly not! For I also
am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God has not cast away His people
whom He foreknew. Or do you not know
what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he
pleads with God against Israel, saying,
3 "LORD, they have killed Your prophets
and torn down Your altars, and I alone
am le , and they seek my life"?
4 But what does the divine response
say to him? "I have reserved for Myself
seven thousand men who have not
bowed the knee to Baal."
5 Even so then, at this present me
there is a remnant according to the
elec on of grace.
6 And if by grace, then it is no longer
of works; otherwise grace is no longer
grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer
grace; otherwise work is no longer work.ROMANS 11
48
7 What then? Israel has not obtained
what it seeks; but the elect have
obtained it, and the rest were blinded.
8 Just as it is wri en: "God has given
them a spirit of stupor, Eyes that they
should not see And ears that they should
not hear, To this very day."
9 And David says: "Let their table
become a snare and a trap, A stumbling
block and a recompense to them.
10 Let their eyes be darkened, so that
they do not see, and bow down their
back always."
11 I say then, have they stumbled that
they should fall? Certainly not! But
through their fall, to provoke them
to jealousy, salva on has come to the
Gen les.
12 Now if their fall is riches for the
world, and their failure riches for the
Gen les, how much more their fullness!ROMANS 11
13 For I speak to you Gen
49
les; inasmuch
as I am an apostle to the Gen les, I
magnify my ministry,
14 if by any means I may provoke to
jealousy those who are my ﬂesh and
save some of them.
15 For if their being cast away is the
reconciling of the world, what will their
acceptance be but life from the dead?
16 For if the ﬁrs ruit is holy, the lump is
also holy; and if the root is holy, so are
the branches.
17 And if some of the branches were
broken oﬀ, and you, being a wild olive
tree, were gra ed in among them, and
with them became a partaker of the root
and fatness of the olive tree,
18 do not boast against the branches.
But if you do boast, remember that you
do not support the root, but the root
supports you.ROMANS 11
50
19 You will say then, "Branches were
broken oﬀ that I might be gra ed in."
20 Well said. Because of unbelief they
were broken oﬀ, and you stand by faith.
Do not be haughty, but fear.
21 For if God did not spare the natural
branches, He may not spare you either.
22 Therefore consider the goodness
and severity of God: on those who fell,
severity; but toward you, goodness, if
you con nue in His goodness. Otherwise
you also will be cut oﬀ.
23 And they also, if they do not con nue
in unbelief, will be gra ed in, for God is
able to gra them in again.
24 For if you were cut out of the
olive tree which is wild by nature, and
were gra ed contrary to nature into a
cul vated olive tree, how much more
will these, who are natural branches, be
gra ed into their own olive tree?ROMANS 11
51
25 For I do not desire, brethren, that you
should be ignorant of this mystery, lest
you should be wise in your own opinion,
that blindness in part has happened to
Israel un l the fullness of the Gen les
has come in.
26 And so all Israel will be saved, as it is
wri en: "The Deliverer will come out of
Zion, And He will turn away ungodliness
from Jacob;
27 For this is My covenant with them,
When I take away their sins."
28 Concerning the gospel they are
enemies for your sake, but concerning
the elec on they are beloved for the
sake of the fathers.
29 For the gi s and the calling of God
are irrevocable.
30 For as you were once disobedient
to God, yet have now obtained mercy
through their disobedience,ROMANS 11 – 12
52
31 even so these also have now been
disobedient, that through the mercy
shown you they also may obtain mercy.
32 For God has commi ed them all to
disobedience, that He might have mercy
on all.
33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of
the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are His judgments and His
ways past ﬁnding out!
34 "For who has known the mind of
the LORD? Or who has become His
counselor?"
35 "Or who has ﬁrst given to Him And it
shall be repaid to him?"
36 For of Him and through Him and to
Him are all things, to whom be glory
forever. Amen.
1 I beseech you therefore,
brethren, by the mercies of God,
that you present your bodies a living
12ROMANS 12
53
sacriﬁce, holy, acceptable to God, which
is your reasonable service.
2 And do not be conformed to this
world, but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that you may
prove what is that good and acceptable
and perfect will of God.
3 For I say, through the grace given to
me, to everyone who is among you, not
to think of himself more highly than he
ought to think, but to think soberly, as
God has dealt to each one a measure of
faith.
4 For as we have many members in one
body, but all the members do not have
the same func on,
5 so we, being many, are one body in
Christ, and individually members of one
another.
6 Having then gi s diﬀering according
to the grace that is given to us, let usROMANS 12
54
use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in
propor on to our faith;
7 or ministry, let us use it in our
ministering; he who teaches, in teaching;
8 he who exhorts, in exhorta on; he
who gives, with liberality; he who leads,
with diligence; he who shows mercy,
with cheerfulness.
9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor
what is evil. Cling to what is good.
10 Be kindly aﬀec onate to one another
with brotherly love, in honor giving
preference to one another;
11 not lagging in diligence, fervent in
spirit, serving the Lord;
12 rejoicing in hope, pa ent in
tribula on, con nuing steadfastly in
prayer;
13 distribu ng to the needs of the
saints, given to hospitality.
14 Bless those who persecute you; bless
and do not curse.ROMANS 12
55
15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, and
weep with those who weep.
16 Be of the same mind toward one
another. Do not set your mind on high
things, but associate with the humble.
Do not be wise in your own opinion.
17 Repay no one evil for evil. Have
regard for good things in the sight of all
men.
18 If it is possible, as much as depends
on you, live peaceably with all men.
19 Beloved, do not avenge yourselves,
but rather give place to wrath; for it
is wri en, "Vengeance is Mine, I will
repay," says the Lord.
20 Therefore "If your enemy is hungry,
feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink;
For in so doing you will heap coals of ﬁre
on his head."
21 Do not be overcome by evil, but
overcome evil with good.ROMANS 13
13
56
1 Let every soul be subject to the
governing authori es. For there
is no authority except from God, and the
authori es that exist are appointed by
God.
2 Therefore whoever resists the
authority resists the ordinance of God,
and those who resist will bring judgment
on themselves.
3 For rulers are not a terror to good
works, but to evil. Do you want to be
unafraid of the authority? Do what is
good, and you will have praise from the
same.
4 For he is God’s minister to you for
good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he
does not bear the sword in vain; for he
is God’s minister, an avenger to execute
wrath on him who prac ces evil.
5 Therefore you must be subject, not
only because of wrath but also for
conscience’ sake.ROMANS 13
57
6 For because of this you also pay taxes,
for they are God’s ministers a ending
con nually to this very thing.
7 Render therefore to all their due:
taxes to whom taxes are due, customs
to whom customs, fear to whom fear,
honor to whom honor.
8 Owe no one anything except to love
one another, for he who loves another
has fulﬁlled the law.
9 For the commandments, "You shall
not commit adultery," "You shall not
murder," "You shall not steal," "You
shall not bear false witness," "You shall
not covet," and if there is any other
commandment, are all summed up in
this saying, namely, "You shall love your
neighbor as yourself."
10 Love does no harm to a neighbor;
therefore love is the fulﬁllment of the
law.ROMANS 13 – 14
11 And do this, knowing the
58
me, that
now it is high me to awake out of sleep;
for now our salva on is nearer than
when we ﬁrst believed.
12 The night is far spent, the day is at
hand. Therefore let us cast oﬀ the works
of darkness, and let us put on the armor
of light.
13 Let us walk properly, as in the day,
not in revelry and drunkenness, not in
lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy.
14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
make no provision for the ﬂesh, to fulﬁll
its lusts.
1 Receive one who is weak in the
faith, but not to disputes over
doub ul things.
2 For one believes he may eat all things,
but he who is weak eats only vegetables.
3 Let not him who eats despise him who
does not eat, and let not him who does
14ROMANS 14
59
not eat judge him who eats; for God has
received him.
4 Who are you to judge another’s
servant? To his own master he stands or
falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand,
for God is able to make him stand.
5 One person esteems one day above
another; another esteems every day
alike. Let each be fully convinced in his
own mind.
6 He who observes the day, observes
it to the Lord; and he who does not
observe the day, to the Lord he does
not observe it. He who eats, eats to the
Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he
who does not eat, to the Lord he does
not eat, and gives God thanks.
7 For none of us lives to himself, and no
one dies to himself.
8 For if we live, we live to the Lord; and
if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore,
whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.ROMANS 14
60
9 For to this end Christ died and rose
and lived again, that He might be Lord of
both the dead and the living.
10 But why do you judge your brother?
Or why do you show contempt for your
brother? For we shall all stand before
the judgment seat of Christ.
11 For it is wri en: "As I live, says the
LORD, Every knee shall bow to Me, And
every tongue shall confess to God."
12 So then each of us shall give account
of himself to God.
13 Therefore let us not judge one
another anymore, but rather resolve
this, not to put a stumbling block or a
cause to fall in our brother’s way.
14 I know and am convinced by the Lord
Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
itself; but to him who considers anything
to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
15 Yet if your brother is grieved because
of your food, you are no longer walkingROMANS 14
61
in love. Do not destroy with your food
the one for whom Christ died.
16 Therefore do not let your good be
spoken of as evil;
17 for the kingdom of God is not ea ng
and drinking, but righteousness and
peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
18 For he who serves Christ in these
things is acceptable to God and approved
by men.
19 Therefore let us pursue the things
which make for peace and the things by
which one may edify another.
20 Do not destroy the work of God for
the sake of food. All things indeed are
pure, but it is evil for the man who eats
with oﬀense.
21 It is good neither to eat meat nor
drink wine nor do anything by which
your brother stumbles or is oﬀended or
is made weak.ROMANS 14 – 15
62
22 Do you have faith? Have it to yourself
before God. Happy is he who does not
condemn himself in what he approves.
23 But he who doubts is condemned if
he eats, because he does not eat from
faith; for whatever is not from faith is
sin.
1 We then who are strong ought
to bear with the scruples of the
weak, and not to please ourselves.
2 Let each of us please his neighbor for
his good, leading to ediﬁca on.
3 For even Christ did not please Himself;
but as it is wri en, "The reproaches of
those who reproached You fell on Me."
4 For whatever things were wri en
before were wri en for our learning,
that we through the pa ence and
comfort of the Scriptures might have
hope.
5 Now may the God of pa ence and
comfort grant you to be like–minded
15ROMANS 15
63
toward one another, according to Christ
Jesus,
6 that you may with one mind and one
mouth glorify the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
7 Therefore receive one another, just as
Christ also received us, to the glory of
God.
8 Now I say that Jesus Christ has
become a servant to the circumcision
for the truth of God, to conﬁrm the
promises made to the fathers,
9 and that the Gen les might glorify
God for His mercy, as it is wri en: "For
this reason I will confess to You among
the Gen les, And sing to Your name."
10 And again he says: "Rejoice, O
Gen les, with His people!"
11 And again: "Praise the LORD, all you
Gen les! Laud Him, all you peoples!"
12 And again, Isaiah says: "There shall
be a root of Jesse; And He who shall riseROMANS 15
64
to reign over the Gen les, In Him the
Gen les shall hope."
13 Now may the God of hope ﬁll you
with all joy and peace in believing, that
you may abound in hope by the power
of the Holy Spirit.
14 Now I myself am conﬁdent
concerning you, my brethren, that you
also are full of goodness, ﬁlled with all
knowledge, able also to admonish one
another.
15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have
wri en more boldly to you on some
points, as reminding you, because of the
grace given to me by God,
16 that I might be a minister of Jesus
Christ to the Gen les, ministering the
gospel of God, that the oﬀering of the
Gen les might be acceptable, sanc ﬁed
by the Holy Spirit.ROMANS 15
65
17 Therefore I have reason to glory in
Christ Jesus in the things which pertain
to God.
18 For I will not dare to speak of any
of those things which Christ has not
accomplished through me, in word and
deed, to make the Gen les obedient––
19 in mighty signs and wonders, by the
power of the Spirit of God, so that from
Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I
have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
20 And so I have made it my aim to
preach the gospel, not where Christ was
named, lest I should build on another
man’s founda on,
21 but as it is wri en: "To whom He
was not announced, they shall see;
And those who have not heard shall
understand."
22 For this reason I also have been much
hindered from coming to you.ROMANS 15
66
23 But now no longer having a place in
these parts, and having a great desire
these many years to come to you,
24 whenever I journey to Spain, I shall
come to you. For I hope to see you on
my journey, and to be helped on my way
there by you, if ﬁrst I may enjoy your
company for a while.
25 But now I am going to Jerusalem to
minister to the saints.
26 For it pleased those from Macedonia
and Achaia to make a certain
contribu on for the poor among
the saints who are in Jerusalem.
27 It pleased them indeed, and they are
their debtors. For if the Gen les have
been partakers of their spiritual things,
their duty is also to minister to them in
material things.
28 Therefore, when I have performed
this and have sealed to them this fruit, I
shall go by way of you to Spain.ROMANS 15 – 16
67
29 But I know that when I come to you, I
shall come in the fullness of the blessing
of the gospel of Christ.
30 Now I beg you, brethren, through the
Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love
of the Spirit, that you strive together
with me in prayers to God for me,
31 that I may be delivered from those in
Judea who do not believe, and that my
service for Jerusalem may be acceptable
to the saints,
32 that I may come to you with joy by
the will of God, and may be refreshed
together with you.
33 Now the God of peace be with you
all. Amen.
1 I commend to you Phoebe our
sister, who is a servant of the
church in Cenchrea,
2 that you may receive her in the Lord
in a manner worthy of the saints, and
assist her in whatever business she has
16ROMANS 16
68
need of you; for indeed she has been a
helper of many and of myself also.
3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow
workers in Christ Jesus,
4 who risked their own necks for my life,
to whom not only I give thanks, but also
all the churches of the Gen les.
5 Likewise greet the church that is
in their house. Greet my beloved
Epaenetus, who is the ﬁrs ruits of
Achaia to Christ.
6 Greet Mary, who labored much for us.
7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my
countrymen and my fellow prisoners,
who are of note among the apostles,
who also were in Christ before me.
8 Greet Amplias, my beloved in the
Lord.
9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in

10 Greet Apelles, approved in Christ.
Greet those who are of the household of
Aristobulus.
11 Greet Herodion, my countryman.
Greet those who are of the household of
Narcissus who are in the Lord.
12 Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who
have labored in the Lord. Greet the
beloved Persis, who labored much in the
Lord.
13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and
his mother and mine.
14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas,
Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who
are with them.
15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus
and his sister, and Olympas, and all the
saints who are with them.
16 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
The churches of Christ greet you.
17 Now I urge you, brethren, note
those who cause divisions and oﬀenses,ROMANS 16
70
contrary to the doctrine which you
learned, and avoid them.
18 For those who are such do not serve
our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly,
and by smooth words and ﬂa ering
speech deceive the hearts of the simple.
19 For your obedience has become
known to all. Therefore I am glad on your
behalf; but I want you to be wise in what
is good, and simple concerning evil.
20 And the God of peace will crush
Satan under your feet shortly. The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Amen.
21 Timothy, my fellow worker, and
Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my
countrymen, greet you.
22 I, Ter us, who wrote this epistle,
greet you in the Lord.
23 Gaius, my host and the host of the
whole church, greets you. Erastus, theROMANS 16
71
treasurer of the city, greets you, and
Quartus, a brother.
24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.
25 Now to Him who is able to establish
you according to my gospel and the
preaching of Jesus Christ, according to
the revela on of the mystery kept secret
since the world began
26 but now made manifest, and by the
prophe c Scriptures made known to all
na ons, according to the commandment
of the everlas ng God, for obedience to
the faith––
27 to God, alone wise, be glory through
Jesus Christ forever. Amen.1 Corinthians
1
1 Paul, called to be an apostle of
Jesus Christ through the will of God,
and Sosthenes our brother,
2 To the church of God which is at
Corinth, to those who are sanc ﬁed in
Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all
who in every place call on the name of
Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and
ours:
3 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I thank my God always concerning you
for the grace of God which was given to
you by Christ Jesus,
5 that you were enriched in everything
by Him in all u erance and all knowledge,
6 even as the tes mony of Christ was
conﬁrmed in you,1 CORINTHIANS 1
7 so that you come short in no gi
2
,
eagerly wai ng for the revela on of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
8 who will also conﬁrm you to the end,
that you may be blameless in the day of
our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 God is faithful, by whom you were
called into the fellowship of His Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord.
10 Now I plead with you, brethren, by
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
you all speak the same thing, and that
there be no divisions among you, but
that you be perfectly joined together
in the same mind and in the same
judgment.
11 For it has been declared to me
concerning you, my brethren, by those
of Chloe’s household, that there are
conten ons among you.1 CORINTHIANS 1
3
12 Now I say this, that each of you says,
"I am of Paul," or "I am of Apollos," or "I
am of Cephas," or "I am of Christ."
13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul cruciﬁed
for you? Or were you bap zed in the
name of Paul?
14 I thank God that I bap zed none of
you except Crispus and Gaius,
15 lest anyone should say that I had
bap zed in my own name.
16 Yes, I also bap zed the household
of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know
whether I bap zed any other.
17 For Christ did not send me to bap ze,
but to preach the gospel, not with
wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ
should be made of no eﬀect.
18 For the message of the cross is
foolishness to those who are perishing,
but to us who are being saved it is the
power of God.1 CORINTHIANS 1
19 For it is wri
4
en: "I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, And bring to nothing
the understanding of the prudent."
20 Where is the wise? Where is the
scribe? Where is the disputer of this
age? Has not God made foolish the
wisdom of this world?
21 For since, in the wisdom of God,
the world through wisdom did not
know God, it pleased God through the
foolishness of the message preached to
save those who believe.
22 For Jews request a sign, and Greeks
seek a er wisdom;
23 but we preach Christ cruciﬁed, to
the Jews a stumbling block and to the
Greeks foolishness,
24 but to those who are called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of
God and the wisdom of God.1 CORINTHIANS 1
5
25 Because the foolishness of God is
wiser than men, and the weakness of
God is stronger than men.
26 For you see your calling, brethren,
that not many wise according to the
ﬂesh, not many mighty, not many noble,
are called.
27 But God has chosen the foolish things
of the world to put to shame the wise,
and God has chosen the weak things of
the world to put to shame the things
which are mighty;
28 and the base things of the world and
the things which are despised God has
chosen, and the things which are not, to
bring to nothing the things that are,
29 that no ﬂesh should glory in His
presence.
30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus,
who became for us wisdom from God––
and righteousness and sanc ﬁca on and
redemp on––1 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
31 that, as it is wri
6
en, "He who glories,
let him glory in the LORD."
1 And I, brethren, when I came to
you, did not come with excellence
of speech or of wisdom declaring to you
the tes mony of God.
2 For I determined not to know anything
among you except Jesus Christ and Him
cruciﬁed.
3 I was with you in weakness, in fear,
and in much trembling.
4 And my speech and my preaching
were not with persuasive words of
human wisdom, but in demonstra on of
the Spirit and of power,
5 that your faith should not be in the
wisdom of men but in the power of God.
6 However, we speak wisdom among
those who are mature, yet not the
wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of
this age, who are coming to nothing.
21 CORINTHIANS 2
7
7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a
mystery, the hidden wisdom which God
ordained before the ages for our glory,
8 which none of the rulers of this age
knew; for had they known, they would
not have cruciﬁed the Lord of glory.
9 But as it is wri en: "Eye has not seen,
nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the
heart of man The things which God has
prepared for those who love Him."
10 But God has revealed them to us
through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches
all things, yes, the deep things of God.
11 For what man knows the things of a
man except the spirit of the man which
is in him? Even so no one knows the
things of God except the Spirit of God.
12 Now we have received, not the spirit
of the world, but the Spirit who is from
God, that we might know the things that
have been freely given to us by God.1 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
8
13 These things we also speak, not in
words which man’s wisdom teaches but
which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing
spiritual things with spiritual.
14 But the natural man does not receive
the things of the Spirit of God, for
they are foolishness to him; nor can he
know them, because they are spiritually
discerned.
15 But he who is spiritual judges all
things, yet he himself is rightly judged by
no one.
16 For "who has known the mind of the
LORD that he may instruct Him?" But we
have the mind of Christ.
1 And I, brethren, could not speak to
you as to spiritual people but as to
carnal, as to babes in Christ.
2 I fed you with milk and not with solid
food; for un l now you were not able to
receive it, and even now you are s ll not
able;
31 CORINTHIANS 3
3 for you are s
9
ll carnal. For where there
are envy, strife, and divisions among
you, are you not carnal and behaving like
mere men?
4 For when one says, "I am of Paul," and
another, "I am of Apollos," are you not
carnal?
5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos,
but ministers through whom you
believed, as the Lord gave to each one?
6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God
gave the increase.
7 So then neither he who plants is
anything, nor he who waters, but God
who gives the increase.
8 Now he who plants and he who waters
are one, and each one will receive his
own reward according to his own labor.
9 For we are God’s fellow workers; you
are God’s ﬁeld, you are God’s building.
10 According to the grace of God which
was given to me, as a wise master1 CORINTHIANS 3
10
builder I have laid the founda on, and
another builds on it. But let each one
take heed how he builds on it.
11 For no other founda on can anyone
lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus
Christ.
12 Now if anyone builds on this
founda on with gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, straw,
13 each one’s work will become clear;
for the Day will declare it, because it will
be revealed by ﬁre; and the ﬁre will test
each one’s work, of what sort it is.
14 If anyone’s work which he has built
on it endures, he will receive a reward.
15 If anyone’s work is burned, he will
suﬀer loss; but he himself will be saved,
yet so as through ﬁre.
16 Do you not know that you are the
temple of God and that the Spirit of God
dwells in you?1 CORINTHIANS 3
11
17 If anyone deﬁles the temple of God,
God will destroy him. For the temple of
God is holy, which temple you are.
18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone
among you seems to be wise in this
age, let him become a fool that he may
become wise.
19 For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. For it is wri en,
"He catches the wise in their own
cra iness";
20 and again, "The LORD knows the
thoughts of the wise, that they are
fu le."
21 Therefore let no one boast in men.
For all things are yours:
22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas,
or the world or life or death, or things
present or things to come––all are yours.
23 And you are Christ’s, and Christ is
God’s.1 CORINTHIANS 4
4
12
1 Let a man so consider us, as
servants of Christ and stewards of
the mysteries of God.
2 Moreover it is required in stewards
that one be found faithful.
3 But with me it is a very small thing
that I should be judged by you or by a
human court. In fact, I do not even judge
myself.
4 For I know nothing against myself, yet
I am not jus ﬁed by this; but He who
judges me is the Lord.
5 Therefore judge nothing before the
me, un l the Lord comes, who will
both bring to light the hidden things of
darkness and reveal the counsels of the
hearts. Then each one’s praise will come
from God.
6 Now these things, brethren, I have
ﬁgura vely transferred to myself and
Apollos for your sakes, that you may
learn in us not to think beyond what is1 CORINTHIANS 4
13
wri en, that none of you may be puﬀed
up on behalf of one against the other.
7 For who makes you diﬀer from
another? And what do you have that you
did not receive? Now if you did indeed
receive it, why do you boast as if you had
not received it?
8 You are already full! You are already
rich! You have reigned as kings without
us––and indeed I could wish you did
reign, that we also might reign with you!
9 For I think that God has displayed us,
the apostles, last, as men condemned
to death; for we have been made a
spectacle to the world, both to angels
and to men.
10 We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you
are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you
are strong! You are dis nguished, but we
are dishonored!1 CORINTHIANS 4
14
11 To the present hour we both hunger
and thirst, and we are poorly clothed,
and beaten, and homeless.
12 And we labor, working with our own
hands. Being reviled, we bless; being
persecuted, we endure;
13 being defamed, we entreat. We have
been made as the ﬁlth of the world, the
oﬀscouring of all things un l now.
14 I do not write these things to shame
you, but as my beloved children I warn
you.
15 For though you might have ten
thousand instructors in Christ, yet you
do not have many fathers; for in Christ
Jesus I have bego en you through the
gospel.
16 Therefore I urge you, imitate me.
17 For this reason I have sent Timothy
to you, who is my beloved and faithful
son in the Lord, who will remind you of1 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
15
my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere
in every church.
18 Now some are puﬀed up, as though I
were not coming to you.
19 But I will come to you shortly, if the
Lord wills, and I will know, not the word
of those who are puﬀed up, but the
power.
20 For the kingdom of God is not in
word but in power.
21 What do you want? Shall I come to
you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of
gentleness?
1 It is actually reported that there is
sexual immorality among you, and
such sexual immorality as is not even
named among the Gen les––that a man
has his father’s wife!
2 And you are puﬀed up, and have not
rather mourned, that he who has done
this deed might be taken away from
among you.
51 CORINTHIANS 5
16
3 For I indeed, as absent in body but
present in spirit, have already judged (as
though I were present) him who has so
done this deed.
4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
when you are gathered together, along
with my spirit, with the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
5 deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruc on of the ﬂesh, that his spirit
may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus.
6 Your glorying is not good. Do you not
know that a li le leaven leavens the
whole lump?
7 Therefore purge out the old leaven,
that you may be a new lump, since you
truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ,
our Passover, was sacriﬁced for us.
8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not
with old leaven, nor with the leaven of1 CORINTHIANS 5
17
malice and wickedness, but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
9 I wrote to you in my epistle not to
keep company with sexually immoral
people.
10 Yet I certainly did not mean with the
sexually immoral people of this world,
or with the covetous, or extor oners, or
idolaters, since then you would need to
go out of the world.
11 But now I have wri en to you not
to keep company with anyone named
a brother, who is sexually immoral, or
covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or
a drunkard, or an extor oner––not even
to eat with such a person.
12 For what have I to do with judging
those also who are outside? Do you not
judge those who are inside?
13 But those who are outside God
judges. Therefore "put away from
yourselves the evil person."1 CORINTHIANS 6
1 Dare any of you, having a ma
18
er
against another, go to law before the
unrighteous, and not before the saints?
2 Do you not know that the saints will
judge the world? And if the world will
be judged by you, are you unworthy to
judge the smallest ma ers?
3 Do you not know that we shall judge
angels? How much more, things that
pertain to this life?
4 If then you have judgments concerning
things pertaining to this life, do you
appoint those who are least esteemed
by the church to judge?
5 I say this to your shame. Is it so, that
there is not a wise man among you,
not even one, who will be able to judge
between his brethren?
6 But brother goes to law against
brother, and that before unbelievers!
7 Now therefore, it is already an u er
failure for you that you go to law against
61 CORINTHIANS 6
19
one another. Why do you not rather
accept wrong? Why do you not rather
let yourselves be cheated?
8 No, you yourselves do wrong and
cheat, and you do these things to your
brethren!
9 Do you not know that the unrighteous
will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do
not be deceived. Neither fornicators,
nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
homosexuals, nor sodomites,
10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
drunkards, nor revilers, nor extor oners
will inherit the kingdom of God.
11 And such were some of you. But you
were washed, but you were sanc ﬁed,
but you were jus ﬁed in the name of the
Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.
12 All things are lawful for me, but all
things are not helpful. All things are
lawful for me, but I will not be brought
under the power of any.1 CORINTHIANS 6
20
13 Foods for the stomach and the
stomach for foods, but God will destroy
both it and them. Now the body is not
for sexual immorality but for the Lord,
and the Lord for the body.
14 And God both raised up the Lord and
will also raise us up by His power.
15 Do you not know that your bodies
are members of Christ? Shall I then take
the members of Christ and make them
members of a harlot? Certainly not!
16 Or do you not know that he who is
joined to a harlot is one body with her?
For "the two," He says, "shall become
one ﬂesh."
17 But he who is joined to the Lord is
one spirit with Him.
18 Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that
a man does is outside the body, but he
who commits sexual immorality sins
against his own body.1 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
21
19 Or do you not know that your body
is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in
you, whom you have from God, and you
are not your own?
20 For you were bought at a price;
therefore glorify God in your body and in
your spirit, which are God’s.
1 Now concerning the things of
which you wrote to me: It is good for
a man not to touch a woman.
2 Nevertheless, because of sexual
immorality, let each man have his own
wife, and let each woman have her own
husband.
3 Let the husband render to his wife the
aﬀec on due her, and likewise also the
wife to her husband.
4 The wife does not have authority over
her own body, but the husband does.
And likewise the husband does not have
authority over his own body, but the
wife does.
71 CORINTHIANS 7
22
5 Do not deprive one another except
with consent for a me, that you may
give yourselves to fas ng and prayer;
and come together again so that Satan
does not tempt you because of your lack
of self–control.
6 But I say this as a concession, not as a
commandment.
7 For I wish that all men were even
as I myself. But each one has his own
gi from God, one in this manner and
another in that.
8 But I say to the unmarried and to
the widows: It is good for them if they
remain even as I am;
9 but if they cannot exercise self–
control, let them marry. For it is be er
to marry than to burn with passion.
10 Now to the married I command, yet
not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart
from her husband.1 CORINTHIANS 7
23
11 But even if she does depart, let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to
her husband. And a husband is not to
divorce his wife.
12 But to the rest I, not the Lord, say:
If any brother has a wife who does not
believe, and she is willing to live with
him, let him not divorce her.
13 And a woman who has a husband
who does not believe, if he is willing to
live with her, let her not divorce him.
14 For the unbelieving husband
is sanc ﬁed by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanc ﬁed by the
husband; otherwise your children would
be unclean, but now they are holy.
15 But if the unbeliever departs, let him
depart; a brother or a sister is not under
bondage in such cases. But God has
called us to peace.
16 For how do you know, O wife,
whether you will save your husband? Or1 CORINTHIANS 7
24
how do you know, O husband, whether
you will save your wife?
17 But as God has distributed to each
one, as the Lord has called each one, so
let him walk. And so I ordain in all the
churches.
18 Was anyone called while
circumcised? Let him not become
uncircumcised. Was anyone called
while uncircumcised? Let him not be
circumcised.
19 Circumcision is nothing and
uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping
the commandments of God is what
ma ers.
20 Let each one remain in the same
calling in which he was called.
21 Were you called while a slave? Do
not be concerned about it; but if you can
be made free, rather use it.
22 For he who is called in the Lord while
a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise1 CORINTHIANS 7
25
he who is called while free is Christ’s
slave.
23 You were bought at a price; do not
become slaves of men.
24 Brethren, let each one remain with
God in that state in which he was called.
25 Now concerning virgins: I have no
commandment from the Lord; yet I give
judgment as one whom the Lord in His
mercy has made trustworthy.
26 I suppose therefore that this is good
because of the present distress––that it
is good for a man to remain as he is:
27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not
seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a
wife? Do not seek a wife.
28 But even if you do marry, you have
not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she
has not sinned. Nevertheless such will
have trouble in the ﬂesh, but I would
spare you.1 CORINTHIANS 7
29 But this I say, brethren, the
26
me is
short, so that from now on even those
who have wives should be as though
they had none,
30 those who weep as though they did
not weep, those who rejoice as though
they did not rejoice, those who buy as
though they did not possess,
31 and those who use this world as not
misusing it. For the form of this world is
passing away.
32 But I want you to be without care. He
who is unmarried cares for the things of
the Lord––how he may please the Lord.
33 But he who is married cares about
the things of the world––how he may
please his wife.
34 There is a diﬀerence between a wife
and a virgin. The unmarried woman
cares about the things of the Lord, that
she may be holy both in body and in
spirit. But she who is married cares1 CORINTHIANS 7
27
about the things of the world––how she
may please her husband.
35 And this I say for your own proﬁt, not
that I may put a leash on you, but for
what is proper, and that you may serve
the Lord without distrac on.
36 But if any man thinks he is behaving
improperly toward his virgin, if she is
past the ﬂower of youth, and thus it
must be, let him do what he wishes. He
does not sin; let them marry.
37 Nevertheless he who stands steadfast
in his heart, having no necessity, but
has power over his own will, and has so
determined in his heart that he will keep
his virgin, does well.
38 So then he who gives her in marriage
does well, but he who does not give her
in marriage does be er.
39 A wife is bound by law as long as her
husband lives; but if her husband dies,1 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
28
she is at liberty to be married to whom
she wishes, only in the Lord.
40 But she is happier if she remains as
she is, according to my judgment––and I
think I also have the Spirit of God.
1 Now concerning things oﬀered
to idols: We know that we all have
knowledge. Knowledge puﬀs up, but
love ediﬁes.
2 And if anyone thinks that he knows
anything, he knows nothing yet as he
ought to know.
3 But if anyone loves God, this one is
known by Him.
4 Therefore concerning the ea ng of
things oﬀered to idols, we know that an
idol is nothing in the world, and that
there is no other God but one.
5 For even if there are so–called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth (as there
are many gods and many lords),
81 CORINTHIANS 8
29
6 yet for us there is one God, the Father,
of whom are all things, and we for
Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom are all things, and through whom
we live.
7 However, there is not in everyone
that knowledge; for some, with
consciousness of the idol, un l now eat
it as a thing oﬀered to an idol; and their
conscience, being weak, is deﬁled.
8 But food does not commend us to
God; for neither if we eat are we the
be er, nor if we do not eat are we the
worse.
9 But beware lest somehow this liberty
of yours become a stumbling block to
those who are weak.
10 For if anyone sees you who have
knowledge ea ng in an idol’s temple,
will not the conscience of him who is
weak be emboldened to eat those things
oﬀered to idols?1 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
30
11 And because of your knowledge
shall the weak brother perish, for whom
Christ died?
12 But when you thus sin against
the brethren, and wound their weak
conscience, you sin against Christ.
13 Therefore, if food makes my brother
stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest
I make my brother stumble.
1 Am I not an apostle? Am I not free?
Have I not seen Jesus Christ our
Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
2 If I am not an apostle to others, yet
doubtless I am to you. For you are the
seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
3 My defense to those who examine me
is this:
4 Do we have no right to eat and drink?
5 Do we have no right to take along
a believing wife, as do also the other
apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and
Cephas?
91 CORINTHIANS 9
31
6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have
no right to refrain from working?
7 Who ever goes to war at his own
expense? Who plants a vineyard and
does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a
ﬂock and does not drink of the milk of
the ﬂock?
8 Do I say these things as a mere man?
Or does not the law say the same also?
9 For it is wri en in the law of Moses,
"You shall not muzzle an ox while it
treads out the grain." Is it oxen God is
concerned about?
10 Or does He say it altogether for our
sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is
wri en, that he who plows should plow
in hope, and he who threshes in hope
should be partaker of his hope.
11 If we have sown spiritual things for
you, is it a great thing if we reap your
material things?1 CORINTHIANS 9
32
12 If others are partakers of this right
over you, are we not even more?
Nevertheless we have not used this
right, but endure all things lest we hinder
the gospel of Christ.
13 Do you not know that those who
minister the holy things eat of the things
of the temple, and those who serve at
the altar partake of the oﬀerings of the
altar?
14 Even so the Lord has commanded
that those who preach the gospel should
live from the gospel.
15 But I have used none of these things,
nor have I wri en these things that it
should be done so to me; for it would be
be er for me to die than that anyone
should make my boas ng void.
16 For if I preach the gospel, I have
nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid
upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not
preach the gospel!1 CORINTHIANS 9
33
17 For if I do this willingly, I have a
reward; but if against my will, I have
been entrusted with a stewardship.
18 What is my reward then? That when
I preach the gospel, I may present the
gospel of Christ without charge, that
I may not abuse my authority in the
gospel.
19 For though I am free from all men, I
have made myself a servant to all, that I
might win the more;
20 and to the Jews I became as a Jew,
that I might win Jews; to those who are
under the law, as under the law, that I
might win those who are under the law;
21 to those who are without law, as
without law (not being without law
toward God, but under law toward
Christ), that I might win those who are
without law;
22 to the weak I became as weak, that
I might win the weak. I have become1 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
34
all things to all men, that I might by all
means save some.
23 Now this I do for the gospel’s sake,
that I may be partaker of it with you.
24 Do you not know that those who run
in a race all run, but one receives the
prize? Run in such a way that you may
obtain it.
25 And everyone who competes for the
prize is temperate in all things. Now they
do it to obtain a perishable crown, but
we for an imperishable crown.
26 Therefore I run thus: not with
uncertainty. Thus I ﬁght: not as one who
beats the air.
27 But I discipline my body and bring
it into subjec on, lest, when I have
preached to others, I myself should
become disqualiﬁed.
1 Moreover, brethren, I do not
want you to be unaware that all
101 CORINTHIANS 10
35
our fathers were under the cloud, all
passed through the sea,
2 all were bap zed into Moses in the
cloud and in the sea,
3 all ate the same spiritual food,
4 and all drank the same spiritual drink.
For they drank of that spiritual Rock that
followed them, and that Rock was Christ.
5 But with most of them God was not
well pleased, for their bodies were
sca ered in the wilderness.
6 Now these things became our
examples, to the intent that we should
not lust a er evil things as they also
lusted.
7 And do not become idolaters as were
some of them. As it is wri en, "The
people sat down to eat and drink, and
rose up to play."
8 Nor let us commit sexual immorality,
as some of them did, and in one day
twenty–three thousand fell;1 CORINTHIANS 10
36
9 nor let us tempt Christ, as some of
them also tempted, and were destroyed
by serpents;
10 nor complain, as some of them also
complained, and were destroyed by the
destroyer.
11 Now all these things happened
to them as examples, and they were
wri en for our admoni on, upon whom
the ends of the ages have come.
12 Therefore let him who thinks he
stands take heed lest he fall.
13 No tempta on has overtaken you
except such as is common to man; but
God is faithful, who will not allow you to
be tempted beyond what you are able,
but with the tempta on will also make
the way of escape, that you may be able
to bear it.
14 Therefore, my beloved, ﬂee from
idolatry.1 CORINTHIANS 10
37
15 I speak as to wise men; judge for
yourselves what I say.
16 The cup of blessing which we bless,
is it not the communion of the blood
of Christ? The bread which we break,
is it not the communion of the body of
Christ?
17 For we, though many, are one bread
and one body; for we all partake of that
one bread.
18 Observe Israel a er the ﬂesh: Are not
those who eat of the sacriﬁces partakers
of the altar?
19 What am I saying then? That an idol
is anything, or what is oﬀered to idols is
anything?
20 Rather, that the things which the
Gen les sacriﬁce they sacriﬁce to
demons and not to God, and I do
not want you to have fellowship with
demons.1 CORINTHIANS 10
38
21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons; you cannot
partake of the Lord’s table and of the
table of demons.
22 Or do we provoke the Lord to
jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
23 All things are lawful for me, but not
all things are helpful; all things are lawful
for me, but not all things edify.
24 Let no one seek his own, but each
one the other’s well–being.
25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat
market, asking no ques ons for
conscience’ sake;
26 for "the earth is the LORD’S, and all
its fullness."
27 If any of those who do not believe
invites you to dinner, and you desire
to go, eat whatever is set before you,
asking no ques on for conscience’ sake.
28 But if anyone says to you, "This was
oﬀered to idols," do not eat it for the1 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
39
sake of the one who told you, and for
conscience’ sake; for "the earth is the
LORD’S, and all its fullness."
29 "Conscience, " I say, not your
own, but that of the other. For why is
my liberty judged by another man’s
conscience?
30 But if I partake with thanks, why am I
evil spoken of for the food over which I
give thanks?
31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink,
or whatever you do, do all to the glory of
God.
32 Give no oﬀense, either to the Jews or
to the Greeks or to the church of God,
33 just as I also please all men in all
things, not seeking my own proﬁt, but
the proﬁt of many, that they may be
saved.
1 Imitate me, just as I also imitate
Christ.
111 CORINTHIANS 11
40
2 Now I praise you, brethren, that you
remember me in all things and keep the
tradi ons just as I delivered them to you.
3 But I want you to know that the head
of every man is Christ, the head of
woman is man, and the head of Christ is
God.
4 Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered, dishonors his
head.
5 But every woman who prays or
prophesies with her head uncovered
dishonors her head, for that is one and
the same as if her head were shaved.
6 For if a woman is not covered, let her
also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a
woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be
covered.
7 For a man indeed ought not to cover
his head, since he is the image and glory
of God; but woman is the glory of man.1 CORINTHIANS 11
41
8 For man is not from woman, but
woman from man.
9 Nor was man created for the woman,
but woman for the man.
10 For this reason the woman ought to
have a symbol of authority on her head,
because of the angels.
11 Nevertheless, neither is man
independent of woman, nor woman
independent of man, in the Lord.
12 For as woman came from man, even
so man also comes through woman; but
all things are from God.
13 Judge among yourselves. Is it proper
for a woman to pray to God with her
head uncovered?
14 Does not even nature itself teach
you that if a man has long hair, it is a
dishonor to him?
15 But if a woman has long hair, it is a
glory to her; for her hair is given to her
for a covering.1 CORINTHIANS 11
42
16 But if anyone seems to be
conten ous, we have no such custom,
nor do the churches of God.
17 Now in giving these instruc ons I do
not praise you, since you come together
not for the be er but for the worse.
18 For ﬁrst of all, when you come
together as a church, I hear that there
are divisions among you, and in part I
believe it.
19 For there must also be fac ons
among you, that those who are
approved may be recognized among
you.
20 Therefore when you come together
in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s
Supper.
21 For in ea ng, each one takes his
own supper ahead of others; and one is
hungry and another is drunk.
22 What! Do you not have houses to
eat and drink in? Or do you despise the1 CORINTHIANS 11
43
church of God and shame those who
have nothing? What shall I say to you?
Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise
you.
23 For I received from the Lord that
which I also delivered to you: that the
Lord Jesus on the same night in which
He was betrayed took bread;
24 and when He had given thanks, He
broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is My
body which is broken for you; do this in
remembrance of Me."
25 In the same manner He also took the
cup a er supper, saying, "This cup is the
new covenant in My blood. This do, as
o en as you drink it, in remembrance of
Me."
26 For as o en as you eat this bread and
drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s
death ll He comes.
27 Therefore whoever eats this bread
or drinks this cup of the Lord in an1 CORINTHIANS 11
44
unworthy manner will be guilty of the
body and blood of the Lord.
28 But let a man examine himself, and
so let him eat of the bread and drink of
the cup.
29 For he who eats and drinks in an
unworthy manner eats and drinks
judgment to himself, not discerning the
Lord’s body.
30 For this reason many are weak and
sick among you, and many sleep.
31 For if we would judge ourselves, we
would not be judged.
32 But when we are judged, we are
chastened by the Lord, that we may not
be condemned with the world.
33 Therefore, my brethren, when you
come together to eat, wait for one
another.
34 But if anyone is hungry, let him eat
at home, lest you come together for1 CORINTHIANS 12
45
judgment. And the rest I will set in order
when I come.
1 Now concerning spiritual gi s,
brethren, I do not want you to be
ignorant:
2 You know that you were Gen les,
carried away to these dumb idols,
however you were led.
3 Therefore I make known to you that
no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls
Jesus accursed, and no one can say that
Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.
4 There are diversi es of gi s, but the
same Spirit.
5 There are diﬀerences of ministries,
but the same Lord.
6 And there are diversi es of ac vi es,
but it is the same God who works all in
all.
7 But the manifesta on of the Spirit is
given to each one for the proﬁt of all:
121 CORINTHIANS 12
46
8 for to one is given the word of wisdom
through the Spirit, to another the word
of knowledge through the same Spirit,
9 to another faith by the same Spirit,
to another gi s of healings by the same
Spirit,
10 to another the working of miracles, to
another prophecy, to another discerning
of spirits, to another diﬀerent kinds of
tongues, to another the interpreta on
of tongues.
11 But one and the same Spirit works
all these things, distribu ng to each one
individually as He wills.
12 For as the body is one and has many
members, but all the members of that
one body, being many, are one body, so
also is Christ.
13 For by one Spirit we were all bap zed
into one body––whether Jews or Greeks,
whether slaves or free––and have all
been made to drink into one Spirit.1 CORINTHIANS 12
47
14 For in fact the body is not one
member but many.
15 If the foot should say, "Because I am
not a hand, I am not of the body," is it
therefore not of the body?
16 And if the ear should say, "Because I
am not an eye, I am not of the body," is
it therefore not of the body?
17 If the whole body were an eye, where
would be the hearing? If the whole were
hearing, where would be the smelling?
18 But now God has set the members,
each one of them, in the body just as He
pleased.
19 And if they were all one member,
where would the body be?
20 But now indeed there are many
members, yet one body.
21 And the eye cannot say to the hand,
"I have no need of you"; nor again the
head to the feet, "I have no need of
you."1 CORINTHIANS 12
48
22 No, much rather, those members of
the body which seem to be weaker are
necessary.
23 And those members of the body
which we think to be less honorable,
on these we bestow greater honor; and
our unpresentable parts have greater
modesty,
24 but our presentable parts have no
need. But God composed the body,
having given greater honor to that part
which lacks it,
25 that there should be no schism in the
body, but that the members should have
the same care for one another.
26 And if one member suﬀers, all
the members suﬀer with it; or if one
member is honored, all the members
rejoice with it.
27 Now you are the body of Christ, and
members individually.1 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
49
28 And God has appointed these in the
church: ﬁrst apostles, second prophets,
third teachers, a er that miracles, then
gi s of healings, helps, administra ons,
varie es of tongues.
29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets?
Are all teachers? Are all workers of
miracles?
30 Do all have gi s of healings? Do all
speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
31 But earnestly desire the best gi s.
And yet I show you a more excellent way.
1 Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels, but have
not love, I have become sounding brass
or a clanging cymbal.
2 And though I have the gi of prophecy,
and understand all mysteries and all
knowledge, and though I have all faith,
so that I could remove mountains, but
have not love, I am nothing.
131 CORINTHIANS 13
50
3 And though I bestow all my goods
to feed the poor, and though I give my
body to be burned, but have not love, it
proﬁts me nothing.
4 Love suﬀers long and is kind; love does
not envy; love does not parade itself, is
not puﬀed up;
5 does not behave rudely, does not seek
its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;
6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but
rejoices in the truth;
7 bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never fails. But whether there
are prophecies, they will fail; whether
there are tongues, they will cease;
whether there is knowledge, it will
vanish away.
9 For we know in part and we prophesy
in part.1 CORINTHIANS 13 – 14
51
10 But when that which is perfect has
come, then that which is in part will be
done away.
11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child,
I understood as a child, I thought as a
child; but when I became a man, I put
away childish things.
12 For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but
then face to face. Now I know in part,
but then I shall know just as I also am
known.
13 And now abide faith, hope, love,
these three; but the greatest of these is
love.
1 Pursue love, and desire spiritual
gi s, but especially that you may
prophesy.
2 For he who speaks in a tongue does
not speak to men but to God, for no one
understands him; however, in the spirit
he speaks mysteries.
141 CORINTHIANS 14
52
3 But he who prophesies speaks
ediﬁca on and exhorta on and comfort
to men.
4 He who speaks in a tongue ediﬁes
himself, but he who prophesies ediﬁes
the church.
5 I wish you all spoke with tongues, but
even more that you prophesied; for he
who prophesies is greater than he who
speaks with tongues, unless indeed he
interprets, that the church may receive
ediﬁca on.
6 But now, brethren, if I come to you
speaking with tongues, what shall
I proﬁt you unless I speak to you
either by revela on, by knowledge, by
prophesying, or by teaching?
7 Even things without life, whether ﬂute
or harp, when they make a sound, unless
they make a dis nc on in the sounds,
how will it be known what is piped or
played?1 CORINTHIANS 14
53
8 For if the trumpet makes an uncertain
sound, who will prepare himself for
ba le?
9 So likewise you, unless you u er by
the tongue words easy to understand,
how will it be known what is spoken?
For you will be speaking into the air.
10 There are, it may be, so many kinds
of languages in the world, and none of
them is without signiﬁcance.
11 Therefore, if I do not know the
meaning of the language, I shall be a
foreigner to him who speaks, and he
who speaks will be a foreigner to me.
12 Even so you, since you are zealous for
spiritual gi s, let it be for the ediﬁca on
of the church that you seek to excel.
13 Therefore let him who speaks in a
tongue pray that he may interpret.
14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prays, but my understanding is unfrui ul.1 CORINTHIANS 14
54
15 What is the conclusion then? I will
pray with the spirit, and I will also pray
with the understanding. I will sing with
the spirit, and I will also sing with the
understanding.
16 Otherwise, if you bless with the
spirit, how will he who occupies the
place of the uninformed say "Amen" at
your giving of thanks, since he does not
understand what you say?
17 For you indeed give thanks well, but
the other is not ediﬁed.
18 I thank my God I speak with tongues
more than you all;
19 yet in the church I would rather
speak ﬁve words with my understanding,
that I may teach others also, than ten
thousand words in a tongue.
20 Brethren, do not be children in
understanding; however, in malice be
babes, but in understanding be mature.1 CORINTHIANS 14
21 In the law it is wri
55
en: "With men of
other tongues and other lips I will speak
to this people; And yet, for all that, they
will not hear Me," says the Lord.
22 Therefore tongues are for a sign, not
to those who believe but to unbelievers;
but prophesying is not for unbelievers
but for those who believe.
23 Therefore if the whole church comes
together in one place, and all speak with
tongues, and there come in those who
are uninformed or unbelievers, will they
not say that you are out of your mind?
24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever
or an uninformed person comes in, he is
convinced by all, he is convicted by all.
25 And thus the secrets of his heart are
revealed; and so, falling down on his
face, he will worship God and report that
God is truly among you.
26 How is it then, brethren? Whenever
you come together, each of you has a1 CORINTHIANS 14
56
psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has
a revela on, has an interpreta on. Let
all things be done for ediﬁca on.
27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, let
there be two or at the most three, each
in turn, and let one interpret.
28 But if there is no interpreter, let him
keep silent in church, and let him speak
to himself and to God.
29 Let two or three prophets speak, and
let the others judge.
30 But if anything is revealed to another
who sits by, let the ﬁrst keep silent.
31 For you can all prophesy one by
one, that all may learn and all may be
encouraged.
32 And the spirits of the prophets are
subject to the prophets.
33 For God is not the author of confusion
but of peace, as in all the churches of
the saints.1 CORINTHIANS 14
57
34 Let your women keep silent in the
churches, for they are not permi ed to
speak; but they are to be submissive, as
the law also says.
35 And if they want to learn something,
let them ask their own husbands at
home; for it is shameful for women to
speak in church.
36 Or did the word of God come
originally from you? Or was it you only
that it reached?
37 If anyone thinks himself to
be a prophet or spiritual, let him
acknowledge that the things which I
write to you are the commandments of
the Lord.
38 But if anyone is ignorant, let him be
ignorant.
39 Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly
to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak
with tongues.1 CORINTHIANS 14 – 15
58
40 Let all things be done decently and in
order.
15
1 Moreover, brethren, I declare to
you the gospel which I preached
to you, which also you received and in
which you stand,
2 by which also you are saved, if you
hold fast that word which I preached to
you––unless you believed in vain.
3 For I delivered to you ﬁrst of all that
which I also received: that Christ died for
our sins according to the Scriptures,
4 and that He was buried, and that He
rose again the third day according to the
Scriptures,
5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then
by the twelve.
6 A er that He was seen by over ﬁve
hundred brethren at once, of whom the
greater part remain to the present, but
some have fallen asleep.1 CORINTHIANS 15
7A
59
er that He was seen by James, then
by all the apostles.
8 Then last of all He was seen by me
also, as by one born out of due me.
9 For I am the least of the apostles, who
am not worthy to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God.
10 But by the grace of God I am what
I am, and His grace toward me was not
in vain; but I labored more abundantly
than they all, yet not I, but the grace of
God which was with me.
11 Therefore, whether it was I or they,
so we preach and so you believed.
12 Now if Christ is preached that He
has been raised from the dead, how do
some among you say that there is no
resurrec on of the dead?
13 But if there is no resurrec on of the
dead, then Christ is not risen.1 CORINTHIANS 15
60
14 And if Christ is not risen, then our
preaching is empty and your faith is also
empty.
15 Yes, and we are found false witnesses
of God, because we have tes ﬁed of God
that He raised up Christ, whom He did
not raise up––if in fact the dead do not
rise.
16 For if the dead do not rise, then
Christ is not risen.
17 And if Christ is not risen, your faith is
fu le; you are s ll in your sins!
18 Then also those who have fallen
asleep in Christ have perished.
19 If in this life only we have hope
in Christ, we are of all men the most
pi able.
20 But now Christ is risen from the dead,
and has become the ﬁrs ruits of those
who have fallen asleep.1 CORINTHIANS 15
61
21 For since by man came death, by
Man also came the resurrec on of the
dead.
22 For as in Adam all die, even so in
Christ all shall be made alive.
23 But each one in his own order: Christ
the ﬁrs ruits, a erward those who are
Christ’s at His coming.
24 Then comes the end, when He
delivers the kingdom to God the Father,
when He puts an end to all rule and all
authority and power.
25 For He must reign ll He has put all
enemies under His feet.
26 The last enemy that will be destroyed
is death.
27 For "He has put all things under His
feet." But when He says "all things are
put under Him," it is evident that He who
put all things under Him is excepted.
28 Now when all things are made
subject to Him, then the Son Himself will1 CORINTHIANS 15
62
also be subject to Him who put all things
under Him, that God may be all in all.
29 Otherwise, what will they do who are
bap zed for the dead, if the dead do not
rise at all? Why then are they bap zed
for the dead?
30 And why do we stand in jeopardy
every hour?
31 I aﬃrm, by the boas ng in you which
I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
32 If, in the manner of men, I have
fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
advantage is it to me? If the dead do not
rise, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
we die!"
33 Do not be deceived: "Evil company
corrupts good habits."
34 Awake to righteousness, and do not
sin; for some do not have the knowledge
of God. I speak this to your shame.1 CORINTHIANS 15
63
35 But someone will say, "How are the
dead raised up? And with what body do
they come?"
36 Foolish one, what you sow is not
made alive unless it dies.
37 And what you sow, you do not
sow that body that shall be, but mere
grain––perhaps wheat or some other
grain.
38 But God gives it a body as He pleases,
and to each seed its own body.
39 All ﬂesh is not the same ﬂesh, but
there is one kind of ﬂesh of men, another
ﬂesh of animals, another of ﬁsh, and
another of birds.
40 There are also celes al bodies and
terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the
celes al is one, and the glory of the
terrestrial is another.
41 There is one glory of the sun, another
glory of the moon, and another glory1 CORINTHIANS 15
64
of the stars; for one star diﬀers from
another star in glory.
42 So also is the resurrec on of the
dead. The body is sown in corrup on, it
is raised in incorrup on.
43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in
glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised
in power.
44 It is sown a natural body, it is raised
a spiritual body. There is a natural body,
and there is a spiritual body.
45 And so it is wri en, "The ﬁrst man
Adam became a living being." The last
Adam became a life–giving spirit.
46 However, the spiritual is not ﬁrst, but
the natural, and a erward the spiritual.
47 The ﬁrst man was of the earth, made
of dust; the second Man is the Lord from
heaven.
48 As was the man of dust, so also are
those who are made of dust; and as is1 CORINTHIANS 15
65
the heavenly Man, so also are those who
are heavenly.
49 And as we have borne the image of
the man of dust, we shall also bear the
image of the heavenly Man.
50 Now this I say, brethren, that ﬂesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God; nor does corrup on inherit
incorrup on.
51 Behold, I tell you a mystery: We
shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed––
52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet
will sound, and the dead will be raised
incorrup ble, and we shall be changed.
53 For this corrup ble must put on
incorrup on, and this mortal must put
on immortality.
54 So when this corrup ble has put on
incorrup on, and this mortal has put
on immortality, then shall be brought to1 CORINTHIANS 15 – 16
66
pass the saying that is wri en: "Death is
swallowed up in victory."
55 "O Death, where is your s ng? O
Hades, where is your victory?"
56 The s ng of death is sin, and the
strength of sin is the law.
57 But thanks be to God, who gives us
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be
steadfast, immovable, always abounding
in the work of the Lord, knowing that
your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
1 Now concerning the collec on
for the saints, as I have given
orders to the churches of Gala a, so you
must do also:
2 On the ﬁrst day of the week let each
one of you lay something aside, storing
up as he may prosper, that there be no
collec ons when I come.
161 CORINTHIANS 16
67
3 And when I come, whomever you
approve by your le ers I will send to
bear your gi to Jerusalem.
4 But if it is ﬁ ng that I go also, they
will go with me.
5 Now I will come to you when I pass
through Macedonia (for I am passing
through Macedonia).
6 And it may be that I will remain, or
even spend the winter with you, that you
may send me on my journey, wherever I
go.
7 For I do not wish to see you now on
the way; but I hope to stay a while with
you, if the Lord permits.
8 But I will tarry in Ephesus un l
Pentecost.
9 For a great and eﬀec ve door has
opened to me, and there are many
adversaries.1 CORINTHIANS 16
68
10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he
may be with you without fear; for he
does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
11 Therefore let no one despise him. But
send him on his journey in peace, that
he may come to me; for I am wai ng for
him with the brethren.
12 Now concerning our brother Apollos,
I strongly urged him to come to you with
the brethren, but he was quite unwilling
to come at this me; however, he will
come when he has a convenient me.
13 Watch, stand fast in the faith, be
brave, be strong.
14 Let all that you do be done with love.
15 I urge you, brethren––you know the
household of Stephanas, that it is the
ﬁrs ruits of Achaia, and that they have
devoted themselves to the ministry of
the saints––
16 that you also submit to such, and to
everyone who works and labors with us.1 CORINTHIANS 16
69
17 I am glad about the coming of
Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus,
for what was lacking on your part they
supplied.
18 For they refreshed my spirit and
yours. Therefore acknowledge such
men.
19 The churches of Asia greet you.
Aquila and Priscilla greet you hear ly in
the Lord, with the church that is in their
house.
20 All the brethren greet you. Greet one
another with a holy kiss.
21 The saluta on with my own
hand––Paul’s.
22 If anyone does not love the Lord
Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. O Lord,
come!
23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you.
24 My love be with you all in Christ
Jesus. Amen.2 Corinthians
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
the will of God, and Timothy our
brother, To the church of God which is at
Corinth, with all the saints who are in all
Achaia:
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies
and God of all comfort,
4 who comforts us in all our tribula on,
that we may be able to comfort those
who are in any trouble, with the comfort
with which we ourselves are comforted
by God.
5 For as the suﬀerings of Christ abound
in us, so our consola on also abounds
through Christ.2 CORINTHIANS 1
2
6 Now if we are aﬄicted, it is for
your consola on and salva on, which
is eﬀec ve for enduring the same
suﬀerings which we also suﬀer. Or if we
are comforted, it is for your consola on
and salva on.
7 And our hope for you is steadfast,
because we know that as you are
partakers of the suﬀerings, so also you
will partake of the consola on.
8 For we do not want you to be ignorant,
brethren, of our trouble which came
to us in Asia: that we were burdened
beyond measure, above strength, so
that we despaired even of life.
9 Yes, we had the sentence of death
in ourselves, that we should not trust
in ourselves but in God who raises the
dead,
10 who delivered us from so great a
death, and does deliver us; in whom we
trust that He will s ll deliver us,2 CORINTHIANS 1
3
11 you also helping together in prayer
for us, that thanks may be given by
many persons on our behalf for the gi
granted to us through many.
12 For our boas ng is this: the tes mony
of our conscience that we conducted
ourselves in the world in simplicity and
godly sincerity, not with ﬂeshly wisdom
but by the grace of God, and more
abundantly toward you.
13 For we are not wri ng any other
things to you than what you read
or understand. Now I trust you will
understand, even to the end
14 (as also you have understood us in
part), that we are your boast as you also
are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
15 And in this conﬁdence I intended to
come to you before, that you might have
a second beneﬁt––
16 to pass by way of you to Macedonia,
to come again from Macedonia to you,2 CORINTHIANS 1
4
and be helped by you on my way to
Judea.
17 Therefore, when I was planning this,
did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do
I plan according to the ﬂesh, that with
me there should be Yes, Yes, and No,
No?
18 But as God is faithful, our word to
you was not Yes and No.
19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who
was preached among you by us––by me,
Silvanus, and Timothy––was not Yes and
No, but in Him was Yes.
20 For all the promises of God in Him
are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of
God through us.
21 Now He who establishes us with you
in Christ and has anointed us is God,
22 who also has sealed us and given us
the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.2 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
5
23 Moreover I call God as witness
against my soul, that to spare you I came
no more to Corinth.
24 Not that we have dominion over your
faith, but are fellow workers for your joy;
for by faith you stand.
1 But I determined this within myself,
that I would not come again to you
in sorrow.
2 For if I make you sorrowful, then who
is he who makes me glad but the one
who is made sorrowful by me?
3 And I wrote this very thing to you,
lest, when I came, I should have sorrow
over those from whom I ought to have
joy, having conﬁdence in you all that my
joy is the joy of you all.
4 For out of much aﬄic on and anguish
of heart I wrote to you, with many tears,
not that you should be grieved, but that
you might know the love which I have so
abundantly for you.
22 CORINTHIANS 2
6
5 But if anyone has caused grief, he has
not grieved me, but all of you to some
extent––not to be too severe.
6 This punishment which was inﬂicted
by the majority is suﬃcient for such a
man,
7 so that, on the contrary, you ought
rather to forgive and comfort him, lest
perhaps such a one be swallowed up
with too much sorrow.
8 Therefore I urge you to reaﬃrm your
love to him.
9 For to this end I also wrote, that I
might put you to the test, whether you
are obedient in all things.
10 Now whom you forgive anything, I
also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven
anything, I have forgiven that one for
your sakes in the presence of Christ,
11 lest Satan should take advantage of
us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.2 CORINTHIANS 2
7
12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas
to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was
opened to me by the Lord,
13 I had no rest in my spirit, because
I did not ﬁnd Titus my brother; but
taking my leave of them, I departed for
Macedonia.
14 Now thanks be to God who always
leads us in triumph in Christ, and
through us diﬀuses the fragrance of His
knowledge in every place.
15 For we are to God the fragrance of
Christ among those who are being saved
and among those who are perishing.
16 To the one we are the aroma of death
leading to death, and to the other the
aroma of life leading to life. And who is
suﬃcient for these things?
17 For we are not, as so many, peddling
the word of God; but as of sincerity, but
as from God, we speak in the sight of
God in Christ.2 CORINTHIANS 3
3
8
1 Do we begin again to commend
ourselves? Or do we need, as some
others, epistles of commenda on to you
or le ers of commenda on from you?
2 You are our epistle wri en in our
hearts, known and read by all men;
3 clearly you are an epistle of Christ,
ministered by us, wri en not with ink
but by the Spirit of the living God, not on
tablets of stone but on tablets of ﬂesh,
that is, of the heart.
4 And we have such trust through Christ
toward God.
5 Not that we are suﬃcient of ourselves
to think of anything as being from
ourselves, but our suﬃciency is from
God,
6 who also made us suﬃcient as
ministers of the new covenant, not of
the le er but of the Spirit; for the le er
kills, but the Spirit gives life.2 CORINTHIANS 3
7 But if the ministry of death, wri
9
en
and engraved on stones, was glorious, so
that the children of Israel could not look
steadily at the face of Moses because
of the glory of his countenance, which
glory was passing away,
8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not
be more glorious?
9 For if the ministry of condemna on
had glory, the ministry of righteousness
exceeds much more in glory.
10 For even what was made glorious
had no glory in this respect, because of
the glory that excels.
11 For if what is passing away was
glorious, what remains is much more
glorious.
12 Therefore, since we have such hope,
we use great boldness of speech––
13 unlike Moses, who put a veil over his
face so that the children of Israel could2 CORINTHIANS 3 – 4
10
not look steadily at the end of what was
passing away.
14 But their minds were blinded. For
un l this day the same veil remains
unli ed in the reading of the Old
Testament, because the veil is taken
away in Christ.
15 But even to this day, when Moses is
read, a veil lies on their heart.
16 Nevertheless when one turns to the
Lord, the veil is taken away.
17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
18 But we all, with unveiled face,
beholding as in a mirror the glory of the
Lord, are being transformed into the
same image from glory to glory, just as
by the Spirit of the Lord.
1 Therefore, since we have this
ministry, as we have received mercy,
we do not lose heart.
42 CORINTHIANS 4
11
2 But we have renounced the hidden
things of shame, not walking in cra iness
nor handling the word of God decei ully,
but by manifesta on of the truth
commending ourselves to every man’s
conscience in the sight of God.
3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is
veiled to those who are perishing,
4 whose minds the god of this age has
blinded, who do not believe, lest the
light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
who is the image of God, should shine
on them.
5 For we do not preach ourselves, but
Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your
bondservants for Jesus’ sake.
6 For it is the God who commanded
light to shine out of darkness, who has
shone in our hearts to give the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Jesus Christ.2 CORINTHIANS 4
12
7 But we have this treasure in earthen
vessels, that the excellence of the power
may be of God and not of us.
8 We are hard pressed on every side,
yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but
not in despair;
9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck
down, but not destroyed––
10 always carrying about in the body
the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life
of Jesus also may be manifested in our
body.
11 For we who live are always delivered
to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life
of Jesus also may be manifested in our
mortal ﬂesh.
12 So then death is working in us, but
life in you.
13 And since we have the same spirit
of faith, according to what is wri en, "I
believed and therefore I spoke," we also
believe and therefore speak,2 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
13
14 knowing that He who raised up the
Lord Jesus will also raise us up with
Jesus, and will present us with you.
15 For all things are for your sakes, that
grace, having spread through the many,
may cause thanksgiving to abound to
the glory of God.
16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Even
though our outward man is perishing,
yet the inward man is being renewed
day by day.
17 For our light aﬄic on, which is but
for a moment, is working for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory,
18 while we do not look at the things
which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen. For the things which are
seen are temporary, but the things which
are not seen are eternal.
1 For we know that if our earthly
house, this tent, is destroyed, we
52 CORINTHIANS 5
14
have a building from God, a house
not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.
2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring
to be clothed with our habita on which
is from heaven,
3 if indeed, having been clothed, we
shall not be found naked.
4 For we who are in this tent groan,
being burdened, not because we want to
be unclothed, but further clothed, that
mortality may be swallowed up by life.
5 Now He who has prepared us for this
very thing is God, who also has given us
the Spirit as a guarantee.
6 So we are always conﬁdent, knowing
that while we are at home in the body
we are absent from the Lord.
7 For we walk by faith, not by sight.
8 We are conﬁdent, yes, well pleased
rather to be absent from the body and
to be present with the Lord.2 CORINTHIANS 5
15
9 Therefore we make it our aim,
whether present or absent, to be well
pleasing to Him.
10 For we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ, that each one
may receive the things done in the body,
according to what he has done, whether
good or bad.
11 Knowing, therefore, the terror of the
Lord, we persuade men; but we are well
known to God, and I also trust are well
known in your consciences.
12 For we do not commend ourselves
again to you, but give you opportunity
to boast on our behalf, that you may
have an answer for those who boast in
appearance and not in heart.
13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is
for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is
for you.2 CORINTHIANS 5
16
14 For the love of Christ compels us,
because we judge thus: that if One died
for all, then all died;
15 and He died for all, that those who
live should live no longer for themselves,
but for Him who died for them and rose
again.
16 Therefore, from now on, we regard
no one according to the ﬂesh. Even
though we have known Christ according
to the ﬂesh, yet now we know Him thus
no longer.
17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is
a new crea on; old things have passed
away; behold, all things have become
new.
18 Now all things are of God, who has
reconciled us to Himself through Jesus
Christ, and has given us the ministry of
reconcilia on,
19 that is, that God was in Christ
reconciling the world to Himself, not2 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
17
impu ng their trespasses to them,
and has commi ed to us the word of
reconcilia on.
20 Now then, we are ambassadors for
Christ, as though God were pleading
through us: we implore you on Christ’s
behalf, be reconciled to God.
21 For He made Him who knew no sin to
be sin for us, that we might become the
righteousness of God in Him.
1 We then, as workers together
with Him also plead with you not to
receive the grace of God in vain.
2 For He says: "In an acceptable me
I have heard you, And in the day of
salva on I have helped you." Behold,
now is the accepted me; behold, now
is the day of salva on.
3 We give no oﬀense in anything, that
our ministry may not be blamed.
4 But in all things we commend
ourselves as ministers of God: in much
62 CORINTHIANS 6
18
pa ence, in tribula ons, in needs, in
distresses,
5 in stripes, in imprisonments, in
tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in
fas ngs;
6 by purity, by knowledge, by
longsuﬀering, by kindness, by the Holy
Spirit, by sincere love,
7 by the word of truth, by the power of
God, by the armor of righteousness on
the right hand and on the le ,
8 by honor and dishonor, by evil report
and good report; as deceivers, and yet
true;
9 as unknown, and yet well known; as
dying, and behold we live; as chastened,
and yet not killed;
10 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as
poor, yet making many rich; as having
nothing, and yet possessing all things.
11 O Corinthians! We have spoken
openly to you, our heart is wide open.2 CORINTHIANS 6
19
12 You are not restricted by us, but you
are restricted by your own aﬀec ons.
13 Now in return for the same (I speak
as to children), you also be open.
14 Do not be unequally yoked together
with unbelievers. For what fellowship
has righteousness with lawlessness?
And what communion has light with
darkness?
15 And what accord has Christ with
Belial? Or what part has a believer with
an unbeliever?
16 And what agreement has the temple
of God with idols? For you are the
temple of the living God. As God has
said: "I will dwell in them And walk
among them. I will be their God, And
they shall be My people."
17 Therefore "Come out from among
them And be separate, says the Lord.
Do not touch what is unclean, And I will
receive you."2 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
20
18 "I will be a Father to you, And you
shall be My sons and daughters, Says the
LORD Almighty."
1 Therefore, having these promises,
beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
from all ﬁlthiness of the ﬂesh and spirit,
perfec ng holiness in the fear of God.
2 Open your hearts to us. We have
wronged no one, we have corrupted no
one, we have cheated no one.
3 I do not say this to condemn; for I have
said before that you are in our hearts, to
die together and to live together.
4 Great is my boldness of speech toward
you, great is my boas ng on your behalf.
I am ﬁlled with comfort. I am exceedingly
joyful in all our tribula on.
5 For indeed, when we came to
Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but
we were troubled on every side. Outside
were conﬂicts, inside were fears.
72 CORINTHIANS 7
21
6 Nevertheless God, who comforts the
downcast, comforted us by the coming
of Titus,
7 and not only by his coming, but also
by the consola on with which he was
comforted in you, when he told us of
your earnest desire, your mourning,
your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even
more.
8 For even if I made you sorry with my
le er, I do not regret it; though I did
regret it. For I perceive that the same
epistle made you sorry, though only for
a while.
9 Now I rejoice, not that you were
made sorry, but that your sorrow led to
repentance. For you were made sorry in
a godly manner, that you might suﬀer
loss from us in nothing.
10 For godly sorrow produces
repentance leading to salva on, not2 CORINTHIANS 7
22
to be regre ed; but the sorrow of the
world produces death.
11 For observe this very thing, that
you sorrowed in a godly manner: What
diligence it produced in you, what
clearing of yourselves, what indigna on,
what fear, what vehement desire, what
zeal, what vindica on! In all things you
proved yourselves to be clear in this
ma er.
12 Therefore, although I wrote to you, I
did not do it for the sake of him who had
done the wrong, nor for the sake of him
who suﬀered wrong, but that our care
for you in the sight of God might appear
to you.
13 Therefore we have been comforted
in your comfort. And we rejoiced
exceedingly more for the joy of Titus,
because his spirit has been refreshed by
you all.2 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
23
14 For if in anything I have boasted to
him about you, I am not ashamed. But as
we spoke all things to you in truth, even
so our boas ng to Titus was found true.
15 And his aﬀec ons are greater for you
as he remembers the obedience of you
all, how with fear and trembling you
received him.
16 Therefore I rejoice that I have
conﬁdence in you in everything.
1 Moreover, brethren, we make
known to you the grace of
God bestowed on the churches of
Macedonia:
2 that in a great trial of aﬄic on the
abundance of their joy and their deep
poverty abounded in the riches of their
liberality.
3 For I bear witness that according
to their ability, yes, and beyond their
ability, they were freely willing,
82 CORINTHIANS 8
24
4 imploring us with much urgency
that we would receive the gi and the
fellowship of the ministering to the
saints.
5 And not only as we had hoped, but
they ﬁrst gave themselves to the Lord,
and then to us by the will of God.
6 So we urged Titus, that as he had
begun, so he would also complete this
grace in you as well.
7 But as you abound in everything––in
faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all
diligence, and in your love for us––see
that you abound in this grace also.
8 I speak not by commandment, but I
am tes ng the sincerity of your love by
the diligence of others.
9 For you know the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet
for your sakes He became poor, that you
through His poverty might become rich.2 CORINTHIANS 8
25
10 And in this I give advice: It is to your
advantage not only to be doing what you
began and were desiring to do a year
ago;
11 but now you also must complete the
doing of it; that as there was a readiness
to desire it, so there also may be a
comple on out of what you have.
12 For if there is ﬁrst a willing mind, it is
accepted according to what one has, and
not according to what he does not have.
13 For I do not mean that others should
be eased and you burdened;
14 but by an equality, that now at this
me your abundance may supply their
lack, that their abundance also may
supply your lack––that there may be
equality.
15 As it is wri en, "He who gathered
much had nothing le over, and he who
gathered li le had no lack."2 CORINTHIANS 8
26
16 But thanks be to God who puts the
same earnest care for you into the heart
of Titus.
17 For he not only accepted the
exhorta on, but being more diligent, he
went to you of his own accord.
18 And we have sent with him the
brother whose praise is in the gospel
throughout all the churches,
19 and not only that, but who was also
chosen by the churches to travel with us
with this gi , which is administered by
us to the glory of the Lord Himself and
to show your ready mind,
20 avoiding this: that anyone should
blame us in this lavish gi which is
administered by us––
21 providing honorable things, not only
in the sight of the Lord, but also in the
sight of men.
22 And we have sent with them our
brother whom we have o en proved2 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
27
diligent in many things, but now much
more diligent, because of the great
conﬁdence which we have in you.
23 If anyone inquires about Titus,
he is my partner and fellow worker
concerning you. Or if our brethren are
inquired about, they are messengers of
the churches, the glory of Christ.
24 Therefore show to them, and before
the churches the proof of your love and
of our boas ng on your behalf.
1 Now concerning the ministering to
the saints, it is superﬂuous for me to
write to you;
2 for I know your willingness, about
which I boast of you to the Macedonians,
that Achaia was ready a year ago; and
your zeal has s rred up the majority.
3 Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our
boas ng of you should be in vain in
this respect, that, as I said, you may be
ready;
92 CORINTHIANS 9
28
4 lest if some Macedonians come with
me and ﬁnd you unprepared, we (not
to men on you!) should be ashamed of
this conﬁdent boas ng.
5 Therefore I thought it necessary to
exhort the brethren to go to you ahead
of me, and prepare your generous gi
beforehand, which you had previously
promised, that it may be ready as
a ma er of generosity and not as a
grudging obliga on.
6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly
will also reap sparingly, and he who sows
boun fully will also reap boun fully.
7 So let each one give as he purposes in
his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity;
for God loves a cheerful giver.
8 And God is able to make all grace
abound toward you, that you, always
having all suﬃciency in all things, may
have an abundance for every good work.2 CORINTHIANS 9
9 As it is wri
29
en: "He has dispersed
abroad, He has given to the poor; His
righteousness endures forever."
10 Now may He who supplies seed to
the sower, and bread for food, supply
and mul ply the seed you have sown and
increase the fruits of your righteousness,
11 while you are enriched in everything
for all liberality, which causes
thanksgiving through us to God.
12 For the administra on of this service
not only supplies the needs of the saints,
but also is abounding through many
thanksgivings to God,
13 while, through the proof of this
ministry, they glorify God for the
obedience of your confession to the
gospel of Christ, and for your liberal
sharing with them and all men,
14 and by their prayer for you, who long
for you because of the exceeding grace
of God in you.2 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
30
15 Thanks be to God for His
indescribable gi !
1 Now I, Paul, myself am pleading
with you by the meekness and
gentleness of Christ––who in presence
am lowly among you, but being absent
am bold toward you.
2 But I beg you that when I am present
I may not be bold with that conﬁdence
by which I intend to be bold against
some, who think of us as if we walked
according to the ﬂesh.
3 For though we walk in the ﬂesh, we
do not war according to the ﬂesh.
4 For the weapons of our warfare are
not carnal but mighty in God for pulling
down strongholds,
5 cas ng down arguments and every
high thing that exalts itself against
the knowledge of God, bringing every
thought into cap vity to the obedience
of Christ,
102 CORINTHIANS 10
31
6 and being ready to punish all
disobedience when your obedience is
fulﬁlled.
7 Do you look at things according to
the outward appearance? If anyone is
convinced in himself that he is Christ’s,
let him again consider this in himself,
that just as he is Christ’s, even so we are
Christ’s.
8 For even if I should boast somewhat
more about our authority, which the
Lord gave us for ediﬁca on and not
for your destruc on, I shall not be
ashamed––
9 lest I seem to terrify you by le ers.
10 "For his le ers," they say, "are
weighty and powerful, but his bodily
presence is weak, and his speech
contemp ble."
11 Let such a person consider this, that
what we are in word by le ers when we2 CORINTHIANS 10
32
are absent, such we will also be in deed
when we are present.
12 For we dare not class ourselves
or compare ourselves with those
who commend themselves. But they,
measuring themselves by themselves,
and comparing themselves among
themselves, are not wise.
13 We, however, will not boast beyond
measure, but within the limits of the
sphere which God appointed us––a
sphere which especially includes you.
14 For we are not overextending
ourselves (as though our authority did
not extend to you), for it was to you that
we came with the gospel of Christ;
15 not boas ng of things beyond
measure, that is, in other men’s labors,
but having hope, that as your faith is
increased, we shall be greatly enlarged
by you in our sphere,2 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
33
16 to preach the gospel in the regions
beyond you, and not to boast in another
man’s sphere of accomplishment.
17 But "he who glories, let him glory in
the LORD."
18 For not he who commends himself
is approved, but whom the Lord
commends.
1 Oh, that you would bear with
me in a li le folly––and indeed
you do bear with me.
2 For I am jealous for you with godly
jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one
husband, that I may present you as a
chaste virgin to Christ.
3 But I fear, lest somehow, as the
serpent deceived Eve by his cra iness,
so your minds may be corrupted from
the simplicity that is in Christ.
4 For if he who comes preaches another
Jesus whom we have not preached, or if
you receive a diﬀerent spirit which you
112 CORINTHIANS 11
34
have not received, or a diﬀerent gospel
which you have not accepted––you may
well put up with it!
5 For I consider that I am not at all
inferior to the most eminent apostles.
6 Even though I am untrained in speech,
yet I am not in knowledge. But we have
been thoroughly manifested among you
in all things.
7 Did I commit sin in humbling myself
that you might be exalted, because I
preached the gospel of God to you free
of charge?
8 I robbed other churches, taking wages
from them to minister to you.
9 And when I was present with you,
and in need, I was a burden to no one,
for what I lacked the brethren who
came from Macedonia supplied. And
in everything I kept myself from being
burdensome to you, and so I will keep
myself.2 CORINTHIANS 11
35
10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no one
shall stop me from this boas ng in the
regions of Achaia.
11 Why? Because I do not love you? God
knows!
12 But what I do, I will also con nue to
do, that I may cut oﬀ the opportunity
from those who desire an opportunity to
be regarded just as we are in the things
of which they boast.
13 For such are false apostles, decei ul
workers, transforming themselves into
apostles of Christ.
14 And no wonder! For Satan himself
transforms himself into an angel of light.
15 Therefore it is no great thing if his
ministers also transform themselves into
ministers of righteousness, whose end
will be according to their works.
16 I say again, let no one think me a
fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as
a fool, that I also may boast a li le.2 CORINTHIANS 11
36
17 What I speak, I speak not according
to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in
this conﬁdence of boas ng.
18 Seeing that many boast according to
the ﬂesh, I also will boast.
19 For you put up with fools gladly, since
you yourselves are wise!
20 For you put up with it if one brings
you into bondage, if one devours you, if
one takes from you, if one exalts himself,
if one strikes you on the face.
21 To our shame, I say that we were too
weak for that! But in whatever anyone is
bold––I speak foolishly––I am bold also.
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they
Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of
Abraham? So am I.
23 Are they ministers of Christ? ––I
speak as a fool––I am more: in labors
more abundant, in stripes above
measure, in prisons more frequently, in
deaths o en.2 CORINTHIANS 11
24 From the Jews ﬁve
37
mes I received
forty stripes minus one.
25 Three mes I was beaten with rods;
once I was stoned; three mes I was
shipwrecked; a night and a day I have
been in the deep;
26 in journeys o en, in perils of waters,
in perils of robbers, in perils of my own
countrymen, in perils of the Gen les,
in perils in the city, in perils in the
wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
among false brethren;
27 in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness
o en, in hunger and thirst, in fas ngs
o en, in cold and nakedness––
28 besides the other things, what comes
upon me daily: my deep concern for all
the churches.
29 Who is weak, and I am not weak?
Who is made to stumble, and I do not
burn with indigna on?2 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
38
30 If I must boast, I will boast in the
things which concern my inﬁrmity.
31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who is blessed forever, knows
that I am not lying.
32 In Damascus the governor, under
Aretas the king, was guarding the city of
the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring
to arrest me;
33 but I was let down in a basket through
a window in the wall, and escaped from
his hands.
1 It is doubtless not proﬁtable for
me to boast. I will come to visions
and revela ons of the Lord:
2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen
years ago––whether in the body I do not
know, or whether out of the body I do
not know, God knows––such a one was
caught up to the third heaven.
122 CORINTHIANS 12
39
3 And I know such a man––whether
in the body or out of the body I do not
know, God knows––
4 how he was caught up into Paradise
and heard inexpressible words, which it
is not lawful for a man to u er.
5 Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself
I will not boast, except in my inﬁrmi es.
6 For though I might desire to boast,
I will not be a fool; for I will speak the
truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should
think of me above what he sees me to
be or hears from me.
7 And lest I should be exalted above
measure by the abundance of the
revela ons, a thorn in the ﬂesh was
given to me, a messenger of Satan
to buﬀet me, lest I be exalted above
measure.
8 Concerning this thing I pleaded with
the Lord three mes that it might depart
from me.2 CORINTHIANS 12
40
9 And He said to me, "My grace is
suﬃcient for you, for My strength is
made perfect in weakness." Therefore
most gladly I will rather boast in my
inﬁrmi es, that the power of Christ may
rest upon me.
10 Therefore I take pleasure in
inﬁrmi es, in reproaches, in needs, in
persecu ons, in distresses, for Christ’s
sake. For when I am weak, then I am
strong.
11 I have become a fool in boas ng; you
have compelled me. For I ought to have
been commended by you; for in nothing
was I behind the most eminent apostles,
though I am nothing.
12 Truly the signs of an apostle were
accomplished among you with all
perseverance, in signs and wonders and
mighty deeds.
13 For what is it in which you were
inferior to other churches, except that2 CORINTHIANS 12
41
I myself was not burdensome to you?
Forgive me this wrong!
14 Now for the third me I am ready
to come to you. And I will not be
burdensome to you; for I do not seek
yours, but you. For the children ought
not to lay up for the parents, but the
parents for the children.
15 And I will very gladly spend and be
spent for your souls; though the more
abundantly I love you, the less I am
loved.
16 But be that as it may, I did not burden
you. Nevertheless, being cra y, I caught
you by cunning!
17 Did I take advantage of you by any of
those whom I sent to you?
18 I urged Titus, and sent our brother
with him. Did Titus take advantage of
you? Did we not walk in the same spirit?
Did we not walk in the same steps?2 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
42
19 Again, do you think that we excuse
ourselves to you? We speak before God
in Christ. But we do all things, beloved,
for your ediﬁca on.
20 For I fear lest, when I come, I shall
not ﬁnd you such as I wish, and that I
shall be found by you such as you do
not wish; lest there be conten ons,
jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selﬁsh
ambi ons, backbi ngs, whisperings,
conceits, tumults;
21 lest, when I come again, my God
will humble me among you, and I shall
mourn for many who have sinned
before and have not repented of the
uncleanness, fornica on, and lewdness
which they have prac ced.
1 This will be the third me I am
coming to you. "By the mouth of
two or three witnesses every word shall
be established."
132 CORINTHIANS 13
43
2 I have told you before, and foretell as
if I were present the second me, and
now being absent I write to those who
have sinned before, and to all the rest,
that if I come again I will not spare––
3 since you seek a proof of Christ
speaking in me, who is not weak toward
you, but mighty in you.
4 For though He was cruciﬁed in
weakness, yet He lives by the power of
God. For we also are weak in Him, but
we shall live with Him by the power of
God toward you.
5 Examine yourselves as to whether
you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do
you not know yourselves, that Jesus
Christ is in you? ––unless indeed you are
disqualiﬁed.
6 But I trust that you will know that we
are not disqualiﬁed.
7 Now I pray to God that you do no evil,
not that we should appear approved, but2 CORINTHIANS 13
44
that you should do what is honorable,
though we may seem disqualiﬁed.
8 For we can do nothing against the
truth, but for the truth.
9 For we are glad when we are weak
and you are strong. And this also we
pray, that you may be made complete.
10 Therefore I write these things being
absent, lest being present I should use
sharpness, according to the authority
which the Lord has given me for
ediﬁca on and not for destruc on.
11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Become
complete. Be of good comfort, be of one
mind, live in peace; and the God of love
and peace will be with you.
12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
13 All the saints greet you.
14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God, and the communion
of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.Gala ans
1
1 Paul, an apostle (not from men
nor through man, but through Jesus
Christ and God the Father who raised
Him from the dead),
2 and all the brethren who are with me,
To the churches of Gala a:
3 Grace to you and peace from God the
Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
4 who gave Himself for our sins, that He
might deliver us from this present evil
age, according to the will of our God and
Father,
5 to whom be glory forever and ever.
Amen.
6 I marvel that you are turning away so
soon from Him who called you in the
grace of Christ, to a diﬀerent gospel,GALATIANS 1
2
7 which is not another; but there are
some who trouble you and want to
pervert the gospel of Christ.
8 But even if we, or an angel from
heaven, preach any other gospel to you
than what we have preached to you, let
him be accursed.
9 As we have said before, so now I say
again, if anyone preaches any other
gospel to you than what you have
received, let him be accursed.
10 For do I now persuade men, or
God? Or do I seek to please men? For
if I s ll pleased men, I would not be a
bondservant of Christ.
11 But I make known to you, brethren,
that the gospel which was preached by
me is not according to man.
12 For I neither received it from man,
nor was I taught it, but it came through
the revela on of Jesus Christ.GALATIANS 1
3
13 For you have heard of my former
conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted
the church of God beyond measure and
tried to destroy it.
14 And I advanced in Judaism beyond
many of my contemporaries in my own
na on, being more exceedingly zealous
for the tradi ons of my fathers.
15 But when it pleased God, who
separated me from my mother’s womb
and called me through His grace,
16 to reveal His Son in me, that I might
preach Him among the Gen les, I did
not immediately confer with ﬂesh and
blood,
17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those
who were apostles before me; but I
went to Arabia, and returned again to
Damascus.
18 Then a er three years I went up to
Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained
with him ﬁ een days.GALATIANS 1 – 2
4
19 But I saw none of the other apostles
except James, the Lord’s brother.
20 (Now concerning the things which I
write to you, indeed, before God, I do
not lie.)
21 A erward I went into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia.
22 And I was unknown by face to the
churches of Judea which were in Christ.
23 But they were hearing only, "He who
formerly persecuted us now preaches
the faith which he once tried to destroy."
24 And they gloriﬁed God in me.
1 Then a er fourteen years I went up
again to Jerusalem with Barnabas,
and also took Titus with me.
2 And I went up by revela on, and
communicated to them that gospel
which I preach among the Gen les,
but privately to those who were of
reputa on, lest by any means I might
run, or had run, in vain.
2GALATIANS 2
5
3 Yet not even Titus who was with me,
being a Greek, was compelled to be
circumcised.
4 And this occurred because of false
brethren secretly brought in (who came
in by stealth to spy out our liberty which
we have in Christ Jesus, that they might
bring us into bondage),
5 to whom we did not yield submission
even for an hour, that the truth of the
gospel might con nue with you.
6 But from those who seemed to be
something––whatever they were, it
makes no diﬀerence to me; God shows
personal favori sm to no man––for
those who seemed to be something
added nothing to me.
7 But on the contrary, when they saw
that the gospel for the uncircumcised
had been commi ed to me, as the
gospel for the circumcised was to PeterGALATIANS 2
8 (for He who worked eﬀec
6
vely
in Peter for the apostleship to the
circumcised also worked eﬀec vely in
me toward the Gen les),
9 and when James, Cephas, and John,
who seemed to be pillars, perceived the
grace that had been given to me, they
gave me and Barnabas the right hand
of fellowship, that we should go to the
Gen les and they to the circumcised.
10 They desired only that we should
remember the poor, the very thing
which I also was eager to do.
11 Now when Peter had come to
An och, I withstood him to his face,
because he was to be blamed;
12 for before certain men came from
James, he would eat with the Gen les;
but when they came, he withdrew and
separated himself, fearing those who
were of the circumcision.GALATIANS 2
7
13 And the rest of the Jews also played
the hypocrite with him, so that even
Barnabas was carried away with their
hypocrisy.
14 But when I saw that they were not
straigh orward about the truth of the
gospel, I said to Peter before them all,
"If you, being a Jew, live in the manner
of Gen les and not as the Jews, why do
you compel Gen les to live as Jews?
15 "We who are Jews by nature, and not
sinners of the Gen les,
16 "knowing that a man is not jus ﬁed
by the works of the law but by faith in
Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
Christ Jesus, that we might be jus ﬁed
by faith in Christ and not by the works of
the law; for by the works of the law no
ﬂesh shall be jus ﬁed.
17 "But if, while we seek to be jus ﬁed
by Christ, we ourselves also are foundGALATIANS 2 – 3
8
sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of
sin? Certainly not!
18 "For if I build again those things
which I destroyed, I make myself a
transgressor.
19 "For I through the law died to the law
that I might live to God.
20 "I have been cruciﬁed with Christ; it
is no longer I who live, but Christ lives
in me; and the life which I now live in
the ﬂesh I live by faith in the Son of God,
who loved me and gave Himself for me.
21 "I do not set aside the grace of God;
for if righteousness comes through the
law, then Christ died in vain."
1 O foolish Gala ans! Who has
bewitched you that you should not
obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus
Christ was clearly portrayed among you
as cruciﬁed?
3GALATIANS 3
9
2 This only I want to learn from you: Did
you receive the Spirit by the works of
the law, or by the hearing of faith?
3 Are you so foolish? Having begun
in the Spirit, are you now being made
perfect by the ﬂesh?
4 Have you suﬀered so many things in
vain––if indeed it was in vain?
5 Therefore He who supplies the Spirit
to you and works miracles among you,
does He do it by the works of the law, or
by the hearing of faith? ––
6 just as Abraham "believed God,
and it was accounted to him for
righteousness."
7 Therefore know that only those who
are of faith are sons of Abraham.
8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that
God would jus fy the Gen les by
faith, preached the gospel to Abraham
beforehand, saying, "In you all the
na ons shall be blessed."GALATIANS 3
10
9 So then those who are of faith are
blessed with believing Abraham.
10 For as many as are of the works of
the law are under the curse; for it is
wri en, "Cursed is everyone who does
not con nue in all things which are
wri en in the book of the law, to do
them."
11 But that no one is jus ﬁed by the law
in the sight of God is evident, for "the
just shall live by faith."
12 Yet the law is not of faith, but "the
man who does them shall live by them."
13 Christ has redeemed us from the
curse of the law, having become a
curse for us (for it is wri en, "Cursed is
everyone who hangs on a tree"),
14 that the blessing of Abraham might
come upon the Gen les in Christ Jesus,
that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit through faith.GALATIANS 3
11
15 Brethren, I speak in the manner of
men: Though it is only a man’s covenant,
yet if it is conﬁrmed, no one annuls or
adds to it.
16 Now to Abraham and his Seed were
the promises made. He does not say,
"And to seeds," as of many, but as of
one, "And to your Seed," who is Christ.
17 And this I say, that the law, which
was four hundred and thirty years later,
cannot annul the covenant that was
conﬁrmed before by God in Christ, that
it should make the promise of no eﬀect.
18 For if the inheritance is of the law, it
is no longer of promise; but God gave it
to Abraham by promise.
19 What purpose then does the
law serve? It was added because of
transgressions, ll the Seed should come
to whom the promise was made; and
it was appointed through angels by the
hand of a mediator.GALATIANS 3
12
20 Now a mediator does not mediate
for one only, but God is one.
21 Is the law then against the promises
of God? Certainly not! For if there had
been a law given which could have given
life, truly righteousness would have been
by the law.
22 But the Scripture has conﬁned all
under sin, that the promise by faith in
Jesus Christ might be given to those who
believe.
23 But before faith came, we were kept
under guard by the law, kept for the faith
which would a erward be revealed.
24 Therefore the law was our tutor to
bring us to Christ, that we might be
jus ﬁed by faith.
25 But a er faith has come, we are no
longer under a tutor.
26 For you are all sons of God through
faith in Christ Jesus.GALATIANS 3 – 4
27 For as many of you as were bap
13
zed
into Christ have put on Christ.
28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there
is neither slave nor free, there is neither
male nor female; for you are all one in
Christ Jesus.
29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are
Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to
the promise.
1 Now I say that the heir, as long as
he is a child, does not diﬀer at all
from a slave, though he is master of all,
2 but is under guardians and stewards
un l the me appointed by the father.
3 Even so we, when we were children,
were in bondage under the elements of
the world.
4 But when the fullness of the me had
come, God sent forth His Son, born of a
woman, born under the law,
4GALATIANS 4
14
5 to redeem those who were under the
law, that we might receive the adop on
as sons.
6 And because you are sons, God has
sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your
hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"
7 Therefore you are no longer a slave
but a son, and if a son, then an heir of
God through Christ.
8 But then, indeed, when you did not
know God, you served those which by
nature are not gods.
9 But now a er you have known God, or
rather are known by God, how is it that
you turn again to the weak and beggarly
elements, to which you desire again to
be in bondage?
10 You observe days and months and
seasons and years.
11 I am afraid for you, lest I have labored
for you in vain.GALATIANS 4
15
12 Brethren, I urge you to become like
me, for I became like you. You have not
injured me at all.
13 You know that because of physical
inﬁrmity I preached the gospel to you at
the ﬁrst.
14 And my trial which was in my ﬂesh
you did not despise or reject, but you
received me as an angel of God, even as
Christ Jesus.
15 What then was the blessing you
enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if
possible, you would have plucked out
your own eyes and given them to me.
16 Have I therefore become your enemy
because I tell you the truth?
17 They zealously court you, but for no
good; yes, they want to exclude you,
that you may be zealous for them.
18 But it is good to be zealous in a good
thing always, and not only when I am
present with you.GALATIANS 4
19 My li
16
le children, for whom I labor in
birth again un l Christ is formed in you,
20 I would like to be present with you
now and to change my tone; for I have
doubts about you.
21 Tell me, you who desire to be under
the law, do you not hear the law?
22 For it is wri en that Abraham had
two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the
other by a freewoman.
23 But he who was of the bondwoman
was born according to the ﬂesh, and he
of the freewoman through promise,
24 which things are symbolic. For
these are the two covenants: the one
from Mount Sinai which gives birth to
bondage, which is Hagar––
25 for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in
Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage with her
children––GALATIANS 4
17
26 but the Jerusalem above is free,
which is the mother of us all.
27 For it is wri en: "Rejoice, O barren,
You who do not bear! Break forth and
shout, You who are not in labor! For the
desolate has many more children Than
she who has a husband."
28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are
children of promise.
29 But, as he who was born according to
the ﬂesh then persecuted him who was
born according to the Spirit, even so it is
now.
30 Nevertheless what does the Scripture
say? "Cast out the bondwoman and
her son, for the son of the bondwoman
shall not be heir with the son of the
freewoman."
31 So then, brethren, we are not
children of the bondwoman but of the
free.GALATIANS 5
5
18
1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty
by which Christ has made us free,
and do not be entangled again with a
yoke of bondage.
2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you
become circumcised, Christ will proﬁt
you nothing.
3 And I tes fy again to every man who
becomes circumcised that he is a debtor
to keep the whole law.
4 You have become estranged from
Christ, you who a empt to be jus ﬁed
by law; you have fallen from grace.
5 For we through the Spirit eagerly wait
for the hope of righteousness by faith.
6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
nor uncircumcision avails anything, but
faith working through love.
7 You ran well. Who hindered you from
obeying the truth?
8 This persuasion does not come from
Him who calls you.GALATIANS 5
9 A li
19
le leaven leavens the whole lump.
10 I have conﬁdence in you, in the
Lord, that you will have no other mind;
but he who troubles you shall bear his
judgment, whoever he is.
11 And I, brethren, if I s ll preach
circumcision, why do I s ll suﬀer
persecu on? Then the oﬀense of the
cross has ceased.
12 I could wish that those who trouble
you would even cut themselves oﬀ!
13 For you, brethren, have been called
to liberty; only do not use liberty as an
opportunity for the ﬂesh, but through
love serve one another.
14 For all the law is fulﬁlled in one
word, even in this: "You shall love your
neighbor as yourself."
15 But if you bite and devour one
another, beware lest you be consumed
by one another!GALATIANS 5
20
16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you
shall not fulﬁll the lust of the ﬂesh.
17 For the ﬂesh lusts against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the ﬂesh; and
these are contrary to one another, so
that you do not do the things that you
wish.
18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you
are not under the law.
19 Now the works of the ﬂesh are
evident, which are: adultery, fornica on,
uncleanness, lewdness,
20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, conten ons,
jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selﬁsh
ambi ons, dissensions, heresies,
21 envy, murders, drunkenness,
revelries, and the like; of which I tell you
beforehand, just as I also told you in me
past, that those who prac ce such things
will not inherit the kingdom of God.GALATIANS 5 – 6
21
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
joy, peace, longsuﬀering, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness,
23 gentleness, self–control. Against such
there is no law.
24 And those who are Christ’s have
cruciﬁed the ﬂesh with its passions and
desires.
25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk
in the Spirit.
26 Let us not become conceited,
provoking one another, envying one
another.
1 Brethren, if a man is overtaken
in any trespass, you who are
spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of
gentleness, considering yourself lest you
also be tempted.
2 Bear one another’s burdens, and so
fulﬁll the law of Christ.
6GALATIANS 6
22
3 For if anyone thinks himself to be
something, when he is nothing, he
deceives himself.
4 But let each one examine his own
work, and then he will have rejoicing in
himself alone, and not in another.
5 For each one shall bear his own load.
6 Let him who is taught the word share
in all good things with him who teaches.
7 Do not be deceived, God is not
mocked; for whatever a man sows, that
he will also reap.
8 For he who sows to his ﬂesh will of
the ﬂesh reap corrup on, but he who
sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap
everlas ng life.
9 And let us not grow weary while doing
good, for in due season we shall reap if
we do not lose heart.
10 Therefore, as we have opportunity,
let us do good to all, especially to those
who are of the household of faith.GALATIANS 6
11 See with what large le
23
ers I have
wri en to you with my own hand!
12 As many as desire to make a good
showing in the ﬂesh, these would
compel you to be circumcised, only that
they may not suﬀer persecu on for the
cross of Christ.
13 For not even those who are
circumcised keep the law, but they
desire to have you circumcised that they
may boast in your ﬂesh.
14 But God forbid that I should boast
except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom the world has been
cruciﬁed to me, and I to the world.
15 For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision nor uncircumcision
avails anything, but a new crea on.
16 And as many as walk according to this
rule, peace and mercy be upon them,
and upon the Israel of God.GALATIANS 6
24
17 From now on let no one trouble me,
for I bear in my body the marks of the
Lord Jesus.
18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Amen.Ephesians

1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
the will of God, To the saints who are
in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
us with every spiritual blessing in the
heavenly places in Christ,
4 just as He chose us in Him before the
founda on of the world, that we should
be holy and without blame before Him
in love,
5 having predes ned us to adop on as
sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according
to the good pleasure of His will,EPHESIANS 1
2
6 to the praise of the glory of His grace,
by which He has made us accepted in
the Beloved.
7 In Him we have redemp on through
His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of His grace
8 which He made to abound toward us
in all wisdom and prudence,
9 having made known to us the mystery
of His will, according to His good
pleasure which He purposed in Himself,
10 that in the dispensa on of the
fullness of the mes He might gather
together in one all things in Christ, both
which are in heaven and which are on
earth––in Him.
11 In Him also we have obtained an
inheritance, being predes ned according
to the purpose of Him who works all
things according to the counsel of His
will,EPHESIANS 1
3
12 that we who ﬁrst trusted in Christ
should be to the praise of His glory.
13 In Him you also trusted, a er you
heard the word of truth, the gospel of
your salva on; in whom also, having
believed, you were sealed with the Holy
Spirit of promise,
14 who is the guarantee of our
inheritance un l the redemp on of the
purchased possession, to the praise of
His glory.
15 Therefore I also, a er I heard of your
faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for
all the saints,
16 do not cease to give thanks for you,
making men on of you in my prayers:
17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of glory, may give to you the
spirit of wisdom and revela on in the
knowledge of Him,
18 the eyes of your understanding being
enlightened; that you may know whatEPHESIANS 1 – 2
4
is the hope of His calling, what are the
riches of the glory of His inheritance in
the saints,
19 and what is the exceeding greatness
of His power toward us who believe,
according to the working of His mighty
power
20 which He worked in Christ when He
raised Him from the dead and seated
Him at His right hand in the heavenly
places,
21 far above all principality and power
and might and dominion, and every
name that is named, not only in this age
but also in that which is to come.
22 And He put all things under His feet,
and gave Him to be head over all things
to the church,
23 which is His body, the fullness of Him
who ﬁlls all in all.
1 And you He made alive, who were
dead in trespasses and sins,
2EPHESIANS 2
5
2 in which you once walked according
to the course of this world, according
to the prince of the power of the air,
the spirit who now works in the sons of
disobedience,
3 among whom also we all once
conducted ourselves in the lusts of our
ﬂesh, fulﬁlling the desires of the ﬂesh
and of the mind, and were by nature
children of wrath, just as the others.
4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because
of His great love with which He loved us,
5 even when we were dead in
trespasses, made us alive together with
Christ (by grace you have been saved),
6 and raised us up together, and made
us sit together in the heavenly places in
Christ Jesus,
7 that in the ages to come He might
show the exceeding riches of His grace
in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.EPHESIANS 2
6
8 For by grace you have been saved
through faith, and that not of yourselves;
it is the gi of God,
9 not of works, lest anyone should
boast.
10 For we are His workmanship, created
in Christ Jesus for good works, which
God prepared beforehand that we
should walk in them.
11 Therefore remember that you, once
Gen les in the ﬂesh––who are called
Uncircumcision by what is called the
Circumcision made in the ﬂesh by
hands––
12 that at that me you were
without Christ, being aliens from the
commonwealth of Israel and strangers
from the covenants of promise, having
no hope and without God in the world.
13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once
were far oﬀ have been brought near by
the blood of Christ.EPHESIANS 2
7
14 For He Himself is our peace, who has
made both one, and has broken down
the middle wall of separa on,
15 having abolished in His ﬂesh
the enmity, that is, the law
of commandments contained in
ordinances, so as to create in Himself
one new man from the two, thus making
peace,
16 and that He might reconcile them
both to God in one body through the
cross, thereby pu ng to death the
enmity.
17 And He came and preached peace to
you who were afar oﬀ and to those who
were near.
18 For through Him we both have access
by one Spirit to the Father.
19 Now, therefore, you are no longer
strangers and foreigners, but fellow
ci zens with the saints and members of
the household of God,EPHESIANS 2 – 3
20 having been built on the founda
8
on
of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
Himself being the chief cornerstone,
21 in whom the whole building, being
joined together, grows into a holy temple
in the Lord,
22 in whom you also are being built
together for a dwelling place of God in
the Spirit.
1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner
of Christ Jesus for you Gen les––
2 if indeed you have heard of the
dispensa on of the grace of God which
was given to me for you,
3 how that by revela on He made
known to me the mystery (as I have
brieﬂy wri en already,
4 by which, when you read, you may
understand my knowledge in the
mystery of Christ),
5 which in other ages was not made
known to the sons of men, as it has now
3EPHESIANS 3
9
been revealed by the Spirit to His holy
apostles and prophets:
6 that the Gen les should be fellow
heirs, of the same body, and partakers of
His promise in Christ through the gospel,
7 of which I became a minister according
to the gi of the grace of God given
to me by the eﬀec ve working of His
power.
8 To me, who am less than the least of
all the saints, this grace was given, that
I should preach among the Gen les the
unsearchable riches of Christ,
9 and to make all see what is the
fellowship of the mystery, which from
the beginning of the ages has been
hidden in God who created all things
through Jesus Christ;
10 to the intent that now the manifold
wisdom of God might be made known
by the church to the principali es and
powers in the heavenly places,EPHESIANS 3
10
11 according to the eternal purpose
which He accomplished in Christ Jesus
our Lord,
12 in whom we have boldness and
access with conﬁdence through faith in
Him.
13 Therefore I ask that you do not lose
heart at my tribula ons for you, which is
your glory.
14 For this reason I bow my knees to the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15 from whom the whole family in
heaven and earth is named,
16 that He would grant you, according
to the riches of His glory, to be
strengthened with might through His
Spirit in the inner man,
17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith; that you, being rooted
and grounded in love,EPHESIANS 3 – 4
11
18 may be able to comprehend with all
the saints what is the width and length
and depth and height––
19 to know the love of Christ which
passes knowledge; that you may be ﬁlled
with all the fullness of God.
20 Now to Him who is able to do
exceedingly abundantly above all that
we ask or think, according to the power
that works in us,
21 to Him be glory in the church by
Christ Jesus to all genera ons, forever
and ever. Amen.
1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the
Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of
the calling with which you were called,
2 with all lowliness and gentleness, with
longsuﬀering, bearing with one another
in love,
3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace.
4EPHESIANS 4
12
4 There is one body and one Spirit, just
as you were called in one hope of your
calling;
5 one Lord, one faith, one bap sm;
6 one God and Father of all, who is
above all, and through all, and in you all.
7 But to each one of us grace was given
according to the measure of Christ’s gi .
8 Therefore He says: "When He
ascended on high, He led cap vity
cap ve, And gave gi s to men."
9 (Now this, "He ascended" ––what
does it mean but that He also ﬁrst
descended into the lower parts of the
earth?
10 He who descended is also the One
who ascended far above all the heavens,
that He might ﬁll all things.)
11 And He Himself gave some to
be apostles, some prophets, some
evangelists, and some pastors and
teachers,EPHESIANS 4
13
12 for the equipping of the saints for the
work of ministry, for the edifying of the
body of Christ,
13 ll we all come to the unity of the
faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a perfect man, to the measure of
the stature of the fullness of Christ;
14 that we should no longer be children,
tossed to and fro and carried about with
every wind of doctrine, by the trickery
of men, in the cunning cra iness of
decei ul plo ng,
15 but, speaking the truth in love, may
grow up in all things into Him who is the
head––Christ––
16 from whom the whole body, joined
and knit together by what every joint
supplies, according to the eﬀec ve
working by which every part does its
share, causes growth of the body for the
edifying of itself in love.EPHESIANS 4
17 This I say, therefore, and tes
14
fy in
the Lord, that you should no longer walk
as the rest of the Gen les walk, in the
fu lity of their mind,
18 having their understanding darkened,
being alienated from the life of God,
because of the ignorance that is in them,
because of the blindness of their heart;
19 who, being past feeling, have given
themselves over to lewdness, to work all
uncleanness with greediness.
20 But you have not so learned Christ,
21 if indeed you have heard Him and
have been taught by Him, as the truth is
in Jesus:
22 that you put oﬀ, concerning your
former conduct, the old man which
grows corrupt according to the decei ul
lusts,
23 and be renewed in the spirit of your
mind,EPHESIANS 4
15
24 and that you put on the new man
which was created according to God, in
true righteousness and holiness.
25 Therefore, pu ng away lying, "Let
each one of you speak truth with his
neighbor," for we are members of one
another.
26 "Be angry, and do not sin": do not let
the sun go down on your wrath,
27 nor give place to the devil.
28 Let him who stole steal no longer,
but rather let him labor, working with his
hands what is good, that he may have
something to give him who has need.
29 Let no corrupt word proceed out
of your mouth, but what is good for
necessary ediﬁca on, that it may impart
grace to the hearers.
30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of
God, by whom you were sealed for the
day of redemp on.EPHESIANS 4 – 5
31 Let all bi
16
erness, wrath, anger,
clamor, and evil speaking be put away
from you, with all malice.
32 And be kind to one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
just as God in Christ forgave you.
1 Therefore be imitators of God as
dear children.
2 And walk in love, as Christ also has
loved us and given Himself for us, an
oﬀering and a sacriﬁce to God for a
sweet–smelling aroma.
3 But fornica on and all uncleanness or
covetousness, let it not even be named
among you, as is ﬁ ng for saints;
4 neither ﬁlthiness, nor foolish talking,
nor coarse jes ng, which are not ﬁ ng,
but rather giving of thanks.
5 For this you know, that no fornicator,
unclean person, nor covetous man, who
is an idolater, has any inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and God.
5EPHESIANS 5
17
6 Let no one deceive you with empty
words, for because of these things the
wrath of God comes upon the sons of
disobedience.
7 Therefore do not be partakers with
them.
8 For you were once darkness, but now
you are light in the Lord. Walk as children
of light
9 (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all
goodness, righteousness, and truth),
10 ﬁnding out what is acceptable to the
Lord.
11 And have no fellowship with the
unfrui ul works of darkness, but rather
expose them.
12 For it is shameful even to speak of
those things which are done by them in
secret.
13 But all things that are exposed are
made manifest by the light, for whatever
makes manifest is light.EPHESIANS 5
18
14 Therefore He says: "Awake, you who
sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ
will give you light."
15 See then that you walk circumspectly,
not as fools but as wise,
16 redeeming the me, because the
days are evil.
17 Therefore do not be unwise, but
understand what the will of the Lord is.
18 And do not be drunk with wine, in
which is dissipa on; but be ﬁlled with
the Spirit,
19 speaking to one another in psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
and making melody in your heart to the
Lord,
20 giving thanks always for all things to
God the Father in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ,
21 submi ng to one another in the fear
of God.EPHESIANS 5
19
22 Wives, submit to your own husbands,
as to the Lord.
23 For the husband is head of the wife,
as also Christ is head of the church; and
He is the Savior of the body.
24 Therefore, just as the church is
subject to Christ, so let the wives be to
their own husbands in everything.
25 Husbands, love your wives, just as
Christ also loved the church and gave
Himself for her,
26 that He might sanc fy and cleanse
her with the washing of water by the
word,
27 that He might present her to Himself
a glorious church, not having spot or
wrinkle or any such thing, but that she
should be holy and without blemish.
28 So husbands ought to love their own
wives as their own bodies; he who loves
his wife loves himself.EPHESIANS 5 – 6
20
29 For no one ever hated his own ﬂesh,
but nourishes and cherishes it, just as
the Lord does the church.
30 For we are members of His body, of
His ﬂesh and of His bones.
31 "For this reason a man shall leave
his father and mother and be joined to
his wife, and the two shall become one
ﬂesh."
32 This is a great mystery, but I speak
concerning Christ and the church.
33 Nevertheless let each one of you
in par cular so love his own wife as
himself, and let the wife see that she
respects her husband.
1 Children, obey your parents in the
Lord, for this is right.
2 "Honor your father and mother,"
which is the ﬁrst commandment with
promise:
3 "that it may be well with you and you
may live long on the earth."
6EPHESIANS 6
21
4 And you, fathers, do not provoke your
children to wrath, but bring them up in
the training and admoni on of the Lord.
5 Bondservants, be obedient to those
who are your masters according to
the ﬂesh, with fear and trembling, in
sincerity of heart, as to Christ;
6 not with eyeservice, as men–pleasers,
but as bondservants of Christ, doing the
will of God from the heart,
7 with goodwill doing service, as to the
Lord, and not to men,
8 knowing that whatever good anyone
does, he will receive the same from the
Lord, whether he is a slave or free.
9 And you, masters, do the same things
to them, giving up threatening, knowing
that your own Master also is in heaven,
and there is no par ality with Him.
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
Lord and in the power of His might.EPHESIANS 6
22
11 Put on the whole armor of God, that
you may be able to stand against the
wiles of the devil.
12 For we do not wrestle against ﬂesh
and blood, but against principali es,
against powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this age, against spiritual
hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places.
13 Therefore take up the whole armor of
God, that you may be able to withstand
in the evil day, and having done all, to
stand.
14 Stand therefore, having girded your
waist with truth, having put on the
breastplate of righteousness,
15 and having shod your feet with the
prepara on of the gospel of peace;
16 above all, taking the shield of faith
with which you will be able to quench all
the ﬁery darts of the wicked one.EPHESIANS 6
17 And take the helmet of salva
23
on,
and the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God;
18 praying always with all prayer and
supplica on in the Spirit, being watchful
to this end with all perseverance and
supplica on for all the saints––
19 and for me, that u erance may be
given to me, that I may open my mouth
boldly to make known the mystery of
the gospel,
20 for which I am an ambassador in
chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I
ought to speak.
21 But that you also may know my
aﬀairs and how I am doing, Tychicus, a
beloved brother and faithful minister in
the Lord, will make all things known to
you;
22 whom I have sent to you for this very
purpose, that you may know our aﬀairs,
and that he may comfort your hearts.EPHESIANS 6
24
23 Peace to the brethren, and love with
faith, from God the Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
24 Grace be with all those who love our
Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.Philippians
1
1 Paul and Timothy, bondservants
of Jesus Christ, To all the saints in
Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the
bishops and deacons:
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 I thank my God upon every
remembrance of you,
4 always in every prayer of mine making
request for you all with joy,
5 for your fellowship in the gospel from
the ﬁrst day un l now,
6 being conﬁdent of this very thing, that
He who has begun a good work in you
will complete it un l the day of Jesus
Christ;
7 just as it is right for me to think this of
you all, because I have you in my heart,PHILIPPIANS 1
2
inasmuch as both in my chains and in the
defense and conﬁrma on of the gospel,
you all are partakers with me of grace.
8 For God is my witness, how greatly
I long for you all with the aﬀec on of
Jesus Christ.
9 And this I pray, that your love
may abound s ll more and more in
knowledge and all discernment,
10 that you may approve the things that
are excellent, that you may be sincere
and without oﬀense ll the day of Christ,
11 being ﬁlled with the fruits of
righteousness which are by Jesus Christ,
to the glory and praise of God.
12 But I want you to know, brethren,
that the things which happened to
me have actually turned out for the
furtherance of the gospel,
13 so that it has become evident to the
whole palace guard, and to all the rest,
that my chains are in Christ;PHILIPPIANS 1
3
14 and most of the brethren in the Lord,
having become conﬁdent by my chains,
are much more bold to speak the word
without fear.
15 Some indeed preach Christ even
from envy and strife, and some also from
good will:
16 The former preach Christ from selﬁsh
ambi on, not sincerely, supposing to
add aﬄic on to my chains;
17 but the la er out of love, knowing
that I am appointed for the defense of
the gospel.
18 What then? Only that in every way,
whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is
preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and
will rejoice.
19 For I know that this will turn out for
my deliverance through your prayer and
the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
20 according to my earnest expecta on
and hope that in nothing I shall bePHILIPPIANS 1
4
ashamed, but with all boldness, as
always, so now also Christ will be
magniﬁed in my body, whether by life or
by death.
21 For to me, to live is Christ, and to die
is gain.
22 But if I live on in the ﬂesh, this will
mean fruit from my labor; yet what I
shall choose I cannot tell.
23 For I am hard pressed between the
two, having a desire to depart and be
with Christ, which is far be er.
24 Nevertheless to remain in the ﬂesh is
more needful for you.
25 And being conﬁdent of this, I know
that I shall remain and con nue with you
all for your progress and joy of faith,
26 that your rejoicing for me may be
more abundant in Jesus Christ by my
coming to you again.
27 Only let your conduct be worthy of
the gospel of Christ, so that whether IPHILIPPIANS 1 – 2
5
come and see you or am absent, I may
hear of your aﬀairs, that you stand fast
in one spirit, with one mind striving
together for the faith of the gospel,
28 and not in any way terriﬁed by your
adversaries, which is to them a proof of
perdi on, but to you of salva on, and
that from God.
29 For to you it has been granted on
behalf of Christ, not only to believe in
Him, but also to suﬀer for His sake,
30 having the same conﬂict which you
saw in me and now hear is in me.
1 Therefore if there is any consola on
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
fellowship of the Spirit, if any aﬀec on
and mercy,
2 fulﬁll my joy by being like–minded,
having the same love, being of one
accord, of one mind.
3 Let nothing be done through selﬁsh
ambi on or conceit, but in lowliness of
2PHILIPPIANS 2
6
mind let each esteem others be er than
himself.
4 Let each of you look out not only
for his own interests, but also for the
interests of others.
5 Let this mind be in you which was also
in Christ Jesus,
6 who, being in the form of God, did
not consider it robbery to be equal with
God,
7 but made Himself of no reputa on,
taking the form of a bondservant, and
coming in the likeness of men.
8 And being found in appearance as a
man, He humbled Himself and became
obedient to the point of death, even the
death of the cross.
9 Therefore God also has highly exalted
Him and given Him the name which is
above every name,
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, of those in heaven, and ofPHILIPPIANS 2
7
those on earth, and of those under the
earth,
11 and that every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
God the Father.
12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have
always obeyed, not as in my presence
only, but now much more in my absence,
work out your own salva on with fear
and trembling;
13 for it is God who works in you both
to will and to do for His good pleasure.
14 Do all things without complaining
and dispu ng,
15 that you may become blameless and
harmless, children of God without fault
in the midst of a crooked and perverse
genera on, among whom you shine as
lights in the world,
16 holding fast the word of life, so that
I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I
have not run in vain or labored in vain.PHILIPPIANS 2
8
17 Yes, and if I am being poured out
as a drink oﬀering on the sacriﬁce and
service of your faith, I am glad and
rejoice with you all.
18 For the same reason you also be glad
and rejoice with me.
19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy to you shortly, that I also may
be encouraged when I know your state.
20 For I have no one like–minded, who
will sincerely care for your state.
21 For all seek their own, not the things
which are of Christ Jesus.
22 But you know his proven character,
that as a son with his father he served
with me in the gospel.
23 Therefore I hope to send him at once,
as soon as I see how it goes with me.
24 But I trust in the Lord that I myself
shall also come shortly.
25 Yet I considered it necessary to send
to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellowPHILIPPIANS 2
9
worker, and fellow soldier, but your
messenger and the one who ministered
to my need;
26 since he was longing for you all, and
was distressed because you had heard
that he was sick.
27 For indeed he was sick almost unto
death; but God had mercy on him, and
not only on him but on me also, lest I
should have sorrow upon sorrow.
28 Therefore I sent him the more
eagerly, that when you see him again
you may rejoice, and I may be less
sorrowful.
29 Receive him therefore in the Lord
with all gladness, and hold such men in
esteem;
30 because for the work of Christ he
came close to death, not regarding his
life, to supply what was lacking in your
service toward me.PHILIPPIANS 3
3
10
1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in
the Lord. For me to write the same
things to you is not tedious, but for you
it is safe.
2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil
workers, beware of the mu la on!
3 For we are the circumcision, who
worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in
Christ Jesus, and have no conﬁdence in
the ﬂesh,
4 though I also might have conﬁdence
in the ﬂesh. If anyone else thinks he may
have conﬁdence in the ﬂesh, I more so:
5 circumcised the eighth day, of the
stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,
a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning
the law, a Pharisee;
6 concerning zeal, persecu ng the
church; concerning the righteousness
which is in the law, blameless.
7 But what things were gain to me,
these I have counted loss for Christ.PHILIPPIANS 3
11
8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss
for the excellence of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have
suﬀered the loss of all things, and count
them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ
9 and be found in Him, not having my
own righteousness, which is from the
law, but that which is through faith in
Christ, the righteousness which is from
God by faith;
10 that I may know Him and the power
of His resurrec on, and the fellowship of
His suﬀerings, being conformed to His
death,
11 if, by any means, I may a ain to the
resurrec on from the dead.
12 Not that I have already a ained, or
am already perfected; but I press on,
that I may lay hold of that for which
Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me.
13 Brethren, I do not count myself to
have apprehended; but one thing I do,PHILIPPIANS 3
12
forge ng those things which are behind
and reaching forward to those things
which are ahead,
14 I press toward the goal for the prize
of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
15 Therefore let us, as many as are
mature, have this mind; and if in
anything you think otherwise, God will
reveal even this to you.
16 Nevertheless, to the degree that we
have already a ained, let us walk by the
same rule, let us be of the same mind.
17 Brethren, join in following my
example, and note those who so walk,
as you have us for a pa ern.
18 For many walk, of whom I have
told you o en, and now tell you even
weeping, that they are the enemies of
the cross of Christ:
19 whose end is destruc on, whose god
is their belly, and whose glory is in theirPHILIPPIANS 3 – 4
13
shame––who set their mind on earthly
things.
20 For our ci zenship is in heaven, from
which we also eagerly wait for the Savior,
the Lord Jesus Christ,
21 who will transform our lowly body
that it may be conformed to His glorious
body, according to the working by which
He is able even to subdue all things to
Himself.
1 Therefore, my beloved and longed–
for brethren, my joy and crown, so
stand fast in the Lord, beloved.
2 I implore Euodia and I implore
Syntyche to be of the same mind in the
Lord.
3 And I urge you also, true companion,
help these women who labored with me
in the gospel, with Clement also, and the
rest of my fellow workers, whose names
are in the Book of Life.
4PHILIPPIANS 4
14
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will
say, rejoice!
5 Let your gentleness be known to all
men. The Lord is at hand.
6 Be anxious for nothing, but in
everything by prayer and supplica on,
with thanksgiving, let your requests be
made known to God;
7 and the peace of God, which surpasses
all understanding, will guard your hearts
and minds through Christ Jesus.
8 Finally, brethren, whatever things
are true, whatever things are noble,
whatever things are just, whatever
things are pure, whatever things are
lovely, whatever things are of good
report, if there is any virtue and if there
is anything praiseworthy––meditate on
these things.
9 The things which you learned and
received and heard and saw in me, thesePHILIPPIANS 4
15
do, and the God of peace will be with
you.
10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly
that now at last your care for me has
ﬂourished again; though you surely did
care, but you lacked opportunity.
11 Not that I speak in regard to need,
for I have learned in whatever state I am,
to be content:
12 I know how to be abased, and I know
how to abound. Everywhere and in all
things I have learned both to be full and
to be hungry, both to abound and to
suﬀer need.
13 I can do all things through Christ who
strengthens me.
14 Nevertheless you have done well
that you shared in my distress.
15 Now you Philippians know also that
in the beginning of the gospel, when I
departed from Macedonia, no churchPHILIPPIANS 4
16
shared with me concerning giving and
receiving but you only.
16 For even in Thessalonica you sent aid
once and again for my necessi es.
17 Not that I seek the gi , but I seek the
fruit that abounds to your account.
18 Indeed I have all and abound. I am
full, having received from Epaphroditus
the things sent from you, a sweet–
smelling aroma, an acceptable sacriﬁce,
well pleasing to God.
19 And my God shall supply all your
need according to His riches in glory by
Christ Jesus.
20 Now to our God and Father be glory
forever and ever. Amen.
21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The
brethren who are with me greet you.
22 All the saints greet you, but especially
those who are of Caesar’s household.
23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.Colossians
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
the will of God, and Timothy our
brother,
2 To the saints and faithful brethren in
Christ who are in Colosse: Grace to you
and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.
3 We give thanks to the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always
for you,
4 since we heard of your faith in Christ
Jesus and of your love for all the saints;
5 because of the hope which is laid up
for you in heaven, of which you heard
before in the word of the truth of the
gospel,
6 which has come to you, as it has also
in all the world, and is bringing forthCOLOSSIANS 1
2
fruit, as it is also among you since the
day you heard and knew the grace of
God in truth;
7 as you also learned from Epaphras,
our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful
minister of Christ on your behalf,
8 who also declared to us your love in
the Spirit.
9 For this reason we also, since the day
we heard it, do not cease to pray for you,
and to ask that you may be ﬁlled with
the knowledge of His will in all wisdom
and spiritual understanding;
10 that you may walk worthy of the
Lord, fully pleasing Him, being frui ul in
every good work and increasing in the
knowledge of God;
11 strengthened with all might,
according to His glorious power, for all
pa ence and longsuﬀering with joy;COLOSSIANS 1
3
12 giving thanks to the Father who
has qualiﬁed us to be partakers of the
inheritance of the saints in the light.
13 He has delivered us from the power
of darkness and conveyed us into the
kingdom of the Son of His love,
14 in whom we have redemp on
through His blood, the forgiveness of
sins.
15 He is the image of the invisible God,
the ﬁrstborn over all crea on.
16 For by Him all things were created
that are in heaven and that are on earth,
visible and invisible, whether thrones or
dominions or principali es or powers.
All things were created through Him and
for Him.
17 And He is before all things, and in
Him all things consist.
18 And He is the head of the body,
the church, who is the beginning, theCOLOSSIANS 1
4
ﬁrstborn from the dead, that in all things
He may have the preeminence.
19 For it pleased the Father that in Him
all the fullness should dwell,
20 and by Him to reconcile all things
to Himself, by Him, whether things on
earth or things in heaven, having made
peace through the blood of His cross.
21 And you, who once were alienated
and enemies in your mind by wicked
works, yet now He has reconciled
22 in the body of His ﬂesh through
death, to present you holy, and
blameless, and above reproach in His
sight––
23 if indeed you con nue in the faith,
grounded and steadfast, and are not
moved away from the hope of the gospel
which you heard, which was preached to
every creature under heaven, of which I,
Paul, became a minister.COLOSSIANS 1
5
24 I now rejoice in my suﬀerings for you,
and ﬁll up in my ﬂesh what is lacking in
the aﬄic ons of Christ, for the sake of
His body, which is the church,
25 of which I became a minister
according to the stewardship from God
which was given to me for you, to fulﬁll
the word of God,
26 the mystery which has been hidden
from ages and from genera ons, but
now has been revealed to His saints.
27 To them God willed to make known
what are the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the Gen les: which is
Christ in you, the hope of glory.
28 Him we preach, warning every man
and teaching every man in all wisdom,
that we may present every man perfect
in Christ Jesus.
29 To this end I also labor, striving
according to His working which works in
me migh ly.COLOSSIANS 2
2
6
1 For I want you to know what a great
conﬂict I have for you and those in
Laodicea, and for as many as have not
seen my face in the ﬂesh,
2 that their hearts may be encouraged,
being knit together in love, and a aining
to all riches of the full assurance of
understanding, to the knowledge of the
mystery of God, both of the Father and
of Christ,
3 in whom are hidden all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge.
4 Now this I say lest anyone should
deceive you with persuasive words.
5 For though I am absent in the ﬂesh,
yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see
your good order and the steadfastness
of your faith in Christ.
6 As you have therefore received Christ
Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,
7 rooted and built up in Him and
established in the faith, as you haveCOLOSSIANS 2
7
been taught, abounding in it with
thanksgiving.
8 Beware lest anyone cheat you through
philosophy and empty deceit, according
to the tradi on of men, according to the
basic principles of the world, and not
according to Christ.
9 For in Him dwells all the fullness of
the Godhead bodily;
10 and you are complete in Him, who is
the head of all principality and power.
11 In Him you were also circumcised
with the circumcision made without
hands, by pu ng oﬀ the body of the
sins of the ﬂesh, by the circumcision of
Christ,
12 buried with Him in bap sm, in which
you also were raised with Him through
faith in the working of God, who raised
Him from the dead.
13 And you, being dead in your
trespasses and the uncircumcision ofCOLOSSIANS 2
8
your ﬂesh, He has made alive together
with Him, having forgiven you all
trespasses,
14 having wiped out the handwri ng of
requirements that was against us, which
was contrary to us. And He has taken it
out of the way, having nailed it to the
cross.
15 Having disarmed principali es and
powers, He made a public spectacle of
them, triumphing over them in it.
16 So let no one judge you in food or in
drink, or regarding a fes val or a new
moon or sabbaths,
17 which are a shadow of things to
come, but the substance is of Christ.
18 Let no one cheat you of your reward,
taking delight in false humility and
worship of angels, intruding into those
things which he has not seen, vainly
puﬀed up by his ﬂeshly mind,COLOSSIANS 2 – 3
9
19 and not holding fast to the Head,
from whom all the body, nourished and
knit together by joints and ligaments,
grows with the increase that is from
God.
20 Therefore, if you died with Christ
from the basic principles of the world,
why, as though living in the world, do
you subject yourselves to regula ons––
21 "Do not touch, do not taste, do not
handle,"
22 which all concern things which
perish with the using––according to the
commandments and doctrines of men?
23 These things indeed have an
appearance of wisdom in self–imposed
religion, false humility, and neglect of
the body, but are of no value against the
indulgence of the ﬂesh.
1 If then you were raised with Christ,
seek those things which are above,
3COLOSSIANS 3
10
where Christ is, si ng at the right hand
of God.
2 Set your mind on things above, not on
things on the earth.
3 For you died, and your life is hidden
with Christ in God.
4 When Christ who is our life appears,
then you also will appear with Him in
glory.
5 Therefore put to death your members
which are on the earth: fornica on,
uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and
covetousness, which is idolatry.
6 Because of these things the wrath
of God is coming upon the sons of
disobedience,
7 in which you yourselves once walked
when you lived in them.
8 But now you yourselves are to put
oﬀ all these: anger, wrath, malice,
blasphemy, ﬁlthy language out of your
mouth.COLOSSIANS 3
11
9 Do not lie to one another, since you
have put oﬀ the old man with his deeds,
10 and have put on the new man who is
renewed in knowledge according to the
image of Him who created him,
11 where there is neither Greek nor
Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised,
barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but
Christ is all and in all.
12 Therefore, as the elect of God,
holy and beloved, put on tender
mercies, kindness, humility, meekness,
longsuﬀering;
13 bearing with one another, and
forgiving one another, if anyone has
a complaint against another; even as
Christ forgave you, so you also must do.
14 But above all these things put on
love, which is the bond of perfec on.
15 And let the peace of God rule in your
hearts, to which also you were called in
one body; and be thankful.COLOSSIANS 3
12
16 Let the word of Christ dwell in
you richly in all wisdom, teaching and
admonishing one another in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your hearts to the Lord.
17 And whatever you do in word or
deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father
through Him.
18 Wives, submit to your own husbands,
as is ﬁ ng in the Lord.
19 Husbands, love your wives and do
not be bi er toward them.
20 Children, obey your parents in all
things, for this is well pleasing to the
Lord.
21 Fathers, do not provoke your
children, lest they become discouraged.
22 Bondservants, obey in all things your
masters according to the ﬂesh, not with
eyeservice, as men–pleasers, but in
sincerity of heart, fearing God.COLOSSIANS 3 – 4
23 And whatever you do, do it hear
13
ly,
as to the Lord and not to men,
24 knowing that from the Lord you will
receive the reward of the inheritance;
for you serve the Lord Christ.
25 But he who does wrong will be repaid
for what he has done, and there is no
par ality.
1 Masters, give your bondservants
what is just and fair, knowing that
you also have a Master in heaven.
2 Con nue earnestly in prayer, being
vigilant in it with thanksgiving;
3 meanwhile praying also for us, that
God would open to us a door for the
word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for
which I am also in chains,
4 that I may make it manifest, as I ought
to speak.
5 Walk in wisdom toward those who are
outside, redeeming the me.
4COLOSSIANS 4
14
6 Let your speech always be with grace,
seasoned with salt, that you may know
how you ought to answer each one.
7 Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful
minister, and fellow servant in the Lord,
will tell you all the news about me.
8 I am sending him to you for this
very purpose, that he may know your
circumstances and comfort your hearts,
9 with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved
brother, who is one of you. They will
make known to you all things which are
happening here.
10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets
you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas
(about whom you received instruc ons:
if he comes to you, welcome him),
11 and Jesus who is called Justus.
These are my only fellow workers for
the kingdom of God who are of the
circumcision; they have proved to be a
comfort to me.COLOSSIANS 4

12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a
bondservant of Christ, greets you,
always laboring fervently for you in
prayers, that you may stand perfect and
complete in all the will of God.
13 For I bear him witness that he has a
great zeal for you, and those who are in
Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
14 Luke the beloved physician and
Demas greet you.
15 Greet the brethren who are in
Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church
that is in his house.
16 Now when this epistle is read among
you, see that it is read also in the church
of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise
read the epistle from Laodicea.

the ministry which you have received in

161 Thessalonians
1
1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the
church of the Thessalonians in God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 We give thanks to God always for
you all, making men on of you in our
prayers,
3 remembering without ceasing your
work of faith, labor of love, and pa ence
of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the
sight of our God and Father,
4 knowing, beloved brethren, your
elec on by God.
5 For our gospel did not come to you
in word only, but also in power, and in
the Holy Spirit and in much assurance,1 THESSALONIANS 1
2
as you know what kind of men we were
among you for your sake.
6 And you became followers of us and
of the Lord, having received the word
in much aﬄic on, with joy of the Holy
Spirit,
7 so that you became examples to all in
Macedonia and Achaia who believe.
8 For from you the word of the Lord has
sounded forth, not only in Macedonia
and Achaia, but also in every place. Your
faith toward God has gone out, so that
we do not need to say anything.
9 For they themselves declare
concerning us what manner of entry we
had to you, and how you turned to God
from idols to serve the living and true
God,
10 and to wait for His Son from heaven,
whom He raised from the dead, even
Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to
come.1 THESSALONIANS 2
2
3
1 For you yourselves know, brethren,
that our coming to you was not in
vain.
2 But even a er we had suﬀered before
and were spitefully treated at Philippi,
as you know, we were bold in our God to
speak to you the gospel of God in much
conﬂict.
3 For our exhorta on did not come
from error or uncleanness, nor was it in
deceit.
4 But as we have been approved by God
to be entrusted with the gospel, even so
we speak, not as pleasing men, but God
who tests our hearts.
5 For neither at any me did we use
ﬂa ering words, as you know, nor a
cloak for covetousness––God is witness.
6 Nor did we seek glory from men,
either from you or from others, when we
might have made demands as apostles
of Christ.1 THESSALONIANS 2
4
7 But we were gentle among you, just
as a nursing mother cherishes her own
children.
8 So, aﬀec onately longing for you, we
were well pleased to impart to you not
only the gospel of God, but also our own
lives, because you had become dear to
us.
9 For you remember, brethren, our
labor and toil; for laboring night and day,
that we might not be a burden to any of
you, we preached to you the gospel of
God.
10 You are witnesses, and God also,
how devoutly and justly and blamelessly
we behaved ourselves among you who
believe;
11 as you know how we exhorted, and
comforted, and charged every one of
you, as a father does his own children,1 THESSALONIANS 2
5
12 that you would walk worthy of God
who calls you into His own kingdom and
glory.
13 For this reason we also thank God
without ceasing, because when you
received the word of God which you
heard from us, you welcomed it not as
the word of men, but as it is in truth,
the word of God, which also eﬀec vely
works in you who believe.
14 For you, brethren, became imitators
of the churches of God which are in
Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also
suﬀered the same things from your own
countrymen, just as they did from the
Judeans,
15 who killed both the Lord Jesus
and their own prophets, and have
persecuted us; and they do not please
God and are contrary to all men,
16 forbidding us to speak to the Gen les
that they may be saved, so as always1 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
to ﬁll up the measure of their sins;
but wrath has come upon them to the
u ermost.
17 But we, brethren, having been
taken away from you for a short me
in presence, not in heart, endeavored
more eagerly to see your face with great
desire.
18 Therefore we wanted to come to
you––even I, Paul, me and again––but
Satan hindered us.
19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown
of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the
presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His
coming?
20 For you are our glory and joy.
1 Therefore, when we could no
longer endure it, we thought it good
to be le in Athens alone,
2 and sent Timothy, our brother and
minister of God, and our fellow laborer
in the gospel of Christ, to establish you
31 THESSALONIANS 3
7
and encourage you concerning your
faith,
3 that no one should be shaken by these
aﬄic ons; for you yourselves know that
we are appointed to this.
4 For, in fact, we told you before when
we were with you that we would suﬀer
tribula on, just as it happened, and you
know.
5 For this reason, when I could no
longer endure it, I sent to know your
faith, lest by some means the tempter
had tempted you, and our labor might
be in vain.
6 But now that Timothy has come to us
from you, and brought us good news of
your faith and love, and that you always
have good remembrance of us, greatly
desiring to see us, as we also to see
you––1 THESSALONIANS 3
8
7 therefore, brethren, in all our
aﬄic on and distress we were
comforted concerning you by your faith.
8 For now we live, if you stand fast in
the Lord.
9 For what thanks can we render to God
for you, for all the joy with which we
rejoice for your sake before our God,
10 night and day praying exceedingly
that we may see your face and perfect
what is lacking in your faith?
11 Now may our God and Father
Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct
our way to you.
12 And may the Lord make you increase
and abound in love to one another and
to all, just as we do to you,
13 so that He may establish your hearts
blameless in holiness before our God
and Father at the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ with all His saints.1 THESSALONIANS 4
4
9
1 Finally then, brethren, we urge and
exhort in the Lord Jesus that you
should abound more and more, just as
you received from us how you ought to
walk and to please God;
2 for you know what commandments
we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
3 For this is the will of God, your
sanc ﬁca on: that you should abstain
from sexual immorality;
4 that each of you should know how to
possess his own vessel in sanc ﬁca on
and honor,
5 not in passion of lust, like the Gen les
who do not know God;
6 that no one should take advantage of
and defraud his brother in this ma er,
because the Lord is the avenger of all
such, as we also forewarned you and
tes ﬁed.
7 For God did not call us to uncleanness,
but in holiness.1 THESSALONIANS 4
10
8 Therefore he who rejects this does
not reject man, but God, who has also
given us His Holy Spirit.
9 But concerning brotherly love you
have no need that I should write to you,
for you yourselves are taught by God to
love one another;
10 and indeed you do so toward all the
brethren who are in all Macedonia. But
we urge you, brethren, that you increase
more and more;
11 that you also aspire to lead a quiet
life, to mind your own business, and
to work with your own hands, as we
commanded you,
12 that you may walk properly toward
those who are outside, and that you may
lack nothing.
13 But I do not want you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning those who have
fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others
who have no hope.1 THESSALONIANS 4 – 5
11
14 For if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, even so God will bring with
Him those who sleep in Jesus.
15 For this we say to you by the word
of the Lord, that we who are alive and
remain un l the coming of the Lord will
by no means precede those who are
asleep.
16 For the Lord Himself will descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of an archangel, and with the trumpet of
God. And the dead in Christ will rise ﬁrst.
17 Then we who are alive and remain
shall be caught up together with them in
the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
And thus we shall always be with the
Lord.
18 Therefore comfort one another with
these words.
1 But concerning the mes and the
seasons, brethren, you have no need
that I should write to you.
51 THESSALONIANS 5
12
2 For you yourselves know perfectly
that the day of the Lord so comes as a
thief in the night.
3 For when they say, "Peace and safety!"
then sudden destruc on comes upon
them, as labor pains upon a pregnant
woman. And they shall not escape.
4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness,
so that this Day should overtake you as a
thief.
5 You are all sons of light and sons of
the day. We are not of the night nor of
darkness.
6 Therefore let us not sleep, as others
do, but let us watch and be sober.
7 For those who sleep, sleep at night,
and those who get drunk are drunk at
night.
8 But let us who are of the day be
sober, pu ng on the breastplate of faith
and love, and as a helmet the hope of
salva on.1 THESSALONIANS 5
13
9 For God did not appoint us to wrath,
but to obtain salva on through our Lord
Jesus Christ,
10 who died for us, that whether we
wake or sleep, we should live together
with Him.
11 Therefore comfort each other and
edify one another, just as you also are
doing.
12 And we urge you, brethren, to
recognize those who labor among
you, and are over you in the Lord and
admonish you,
13 and to esteem them very highly in
love for their work’s sake. Be at peace
among yourselves.
14 Now we exhort you, brethren,
warn those who are unruly, comfort
the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be
pa ent with all.1 THESSALONIANS 5
14
15 See that no one renders evil for evil
to anyone, but always pursue what is
good both for yourselves and for all.
16 Rejoice always,
17 pray without ceasing,
18 in everything give thanks; for this is
the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
19 Do not quench the Spirit.
20 Do not despise prophecies.
21 Test all things; hold fast what is good.
22 Abstain from every form of evil.
23 Now may the God of peace Himself
sanc fy you completely; and may your
whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved
blameless at the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
24 He who calls you is faithful, who also
will do it.
25 Brethren, pray for us.
26 Greet all the brethren with a holy
kiss.1 THESSALONIANS 5
15
27 I charge you by the Lord that this
epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you. Amen.2 Thessalonians

may be counted worthy of the kingdom
of God, for which you also suﬀer;
6 since it is a righteous thing with God
to repay with tribula on those who
trouble you,
7 and to give you who are troubled rest
with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed
from heaven with His mighty angels,
8 in ﬂaming ﬁre taking vengeance on
those who do not know God, and on
those who do not obey the gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
9 These shall be punished with
everlas ng destruc on from the
presence of the Lord and from the glory
of His power,
10 when He comes, in that Day, to be
gloriﬁed in His saints and to be admired
among all those who believe, because
our tes mony among you was believed.
11 Therefore we also pray always for you
that our God would count you worthy2 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
3
of this calling, and fulﬁll all the good
pleasure of His goodness and the work
of faith with power,
12 that the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ may be gloriﬁed in you, and you in
Him, according to the grace of our God
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Now, brethren, concerning the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
our gathering together to Him, we ask
you,
2 not to be soon shaken in mind or
troubled, either by spirit or by word or
by le er, as if from us, as though the day
of Christ had come.
3 Let no one deceive you by any means;
for that Day will not come unless the
falling away comes ﬁrst, and the man of
sin is revealed, the son of perdi on,
4 who opposes and exalts himself above
all that is called God or that is worshiped,
22 THESSALONIANS 2
4
so that he sits as God in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God.
5 Do you not remember that when I was
s ll with you I told you these things?
6 And now you know what is restraining,
that he may be revealed in his own me.
7 For the mystery of lawlessness is
already at work; only He who now
restrains will do so un l He is taken out
of the way.
8 And then the lawless one will be
revealed, whom the Lord will consume
with the breath of His mouth and destroy
with the brightness of His coming.
9 The coming of the lawless one is
according to the working of Satan, with
all power, signs, and lying wonders,
10 and with all unrighteous decep on
among those who perish, because they
did not receive the love of the truth, that
they might be saved.2 THESSALONIANS 2
5
11 And for this reason God will send
them strong delusion, that they should
believe the lie,
12 that they all may be condemned
who did not believe the truth but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.
13 But we are bound to give thanks to
God always for you, brethren beloved
by the Lord, because God from the
beginning chose you for salva on
through sanc ﬁca on by the Spirit and
belief in the truth,
14 to which He called you by our gospel,
for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast and
hold the tradi ons which you were
taught, whether by word or our epistle.
16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ
Himself, and our God and Father, who
has loved us and given us everlas ng
consola on and good hope by grace,2 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
17 comfort your hearts and establish
you in every good word and work.
1 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that
the word of the Lord may run swi ly
and be gloriﬁed, just as it is with you,
2 and that we may be delivered from
unreasonable and wicked men; for not
all have faith.
3 But the Lord is faithful, who will
establish you and guard you from the
evil one.
4 And we have conﬁdence in the Lord
concerning you, both that you do and
will do the things we command you.
5 Now may the Lord direct your hearts
into the love of God and into the
pa ence of Christ.
6 But we command you, brethren, in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
you withdraw from every brother who
walks disorderly and not according to
the tradi on which he received from us.
32 THESSALONIANS 3
7
7 For you yourselves know how you
ought to follow us, for we were not
disorderly among you;
8 nor did we eat anyone’s bread free of
charge, but worked with labor and toil
night and day, that we might not be a
burden to any of you,
9 not because we do not have authority,
but to make ourselves an example of
how you should follow us.
10 For even when we were with you, we
commanded you this: If anyone will not
work, neither shall he eat.
11 For we hear that there are some who
walk among you in a disorderly manner,
not working at all, but are busybodies.
12 Now those who are such we
command and exhort through our Lord
Jesus Christ that they work in quietness
and eat their own bread.
13 But as for you, brethren, do not grow
weary in doing good.2 THESSALONIANS 3
8
14 And if anyone does not obey our
word in this epistle, note that person
and do not keep company with him, that
he may be ashamed.
15 Yet do not count him as an enemy,
but admonish him as a brother.
16 Now may the Lord of peace Himself
give you peace always in every way. The
Lord be with you all.
17 The saluta on of Paul with my own
hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so
I write.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.1 Timothy
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by
the commandment of God our Savior
and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,
2 To Timothy, a true son in the faith:
Grace, mercy, and peace from God our
Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
3 As I urged you when I went into
Macedonia––remain in Ephesus that
you may charge some that they teach no
other doctrine,
4 nor give heed to fables and endless
genealogies, which cause disputes rather
than godly ediﬁca on which is in faith.
5 Now the purpose of the
commandment is love from a pure
heart, from a good conscience, and from
sincere faith,1 TIMOTHY 1
2
6 from which some, having strayed,
have turned aside to idle talk,
7 desiring to be teachers of the law,
understanding neither what they say nor
the things which they aﬃrm.
8 But we know that the law is good if
one uses it lawfully,
9 knowing this: that the law is not
made for a righteous person, but for
the lawless and insubordinate, for
the ungodly and for sinners, for the
unholy and profane, for murderers of
fathers and murderers of mothers, for
manslayers,
10 for fornicators, for sodomites, for
kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if
there is any other thing that is contrary
to sound doctrine,
11 according to the glorious gospel of
the blessed God which was commi ed
to my trust.1 TIMOTHY 1
3
12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who
has enabled me, because He counted
me faithful, pu ng me into the ministry,
13 although I was formerly a
blasphemer, a persecutor, and an
insolent man; but I obtained mercy
because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
14 And the grace of our Lord was
exceedingly abundant, with faith and
love which are in Christ Jesus.
15 This is a faithful saying and worthy
of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I
am chief.
16 However, for this reason I obtained
mercy, that in me ﬁrst Jesus Christ might
show all longsuﬀering, as a pa ern to
those who are going to believe on Him
for everlas ng life.
17 Now to the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, to God who alone is wise, be
honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.1 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
4
18 This charge I commit to you, son
Timothy, according to the prophecies
previously made concerning you, that by
them you may wage the good warfare,
19 having faith and a good conscience,
which some having rejected, concerning
the faith have suﬀered shipwreck,
20 of whom are Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan
that they may learn not to blaspheme.
1 Therefore I exhort ﬁrst of all that
supplica ons, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all
men,
2 for kings and all who are in authority,
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
life in all godliness and reverence.
3 For this is good and acceptable in the
sight of God our Savior,
4 who desires all men to be saved and
to come to the knowledge of the truth.
21 TIMOTHY 2
5
5 For there is one God and one Mediator
between God and men, the Man Christ
Jesus,
6 who gave Himself a ransom for all, to
be tes ﬁed in due me,
7 for which I was appointed a preacher
and an apostle––I am speaking the truth
in Christ and not lying––a teacher of the
Gen les in faith and truth.
8 I desire therefore that the men pray
everywhere, li ing up holy hands,
without wrath and doub ng;
9 in like manner also, that the women
adorn themselves in modest apparel,
with propriety and modera on, not with
braided hair or gold or pearls or costly
clothing,
10 but, which is proper for women
professing godliness, with good works.
11 Let a woman learn in silence with all
submission.1 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
6
12 And I do not permit a woman to
teach or to have authority over a man,
but to be in silence.
13 For Adam was formed ﬁrst, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not deceived, but
the woman being deceived, fell into
transgression.
15 Nevertheless she will be saved in
childbearing if they con nue in faith,
love, and holiness, with self–control.
1 This is a faithful saying: If a man
desires the posi on of a bishop, he
desires a good work.
2 A bishop then must be blameless,
the husband of one wife, temperate,
sober–minded, of good behavior,
hospitable, able to teach;
3 not given to wine, not violent, not
greedy for money, but gentle, not
quarrelsome, not covetous;
31 TIMOTHY 3
7
4 one who rules his own house well,
having his children in submission with all
reverence
5 (for if a man does not know how to
rule his own house, how will he take care
of the church of God?);
6 not a novice, lest being puﬀed up with
pride he fall into the same condemna on
as the devil.
7 Moreover he must have a good
tes mony among those who are outside,
lest he fall into reproach and the snare
of the devil.
8 Likewise deacons must be reverent,
not double–tongued, not given to much
wine, not greedy for money,
9 holding the mystery of the faith with a
pure conscience.
10 But let these also ﬁrst be tested; then
let them serve as deacons, being found
blameless.1 TIMOTHY 3
8
11 Likewise their wives must be
reverent, not slanderers, temperate,
faithful in all things.
12 Let deacons be the husbands of one
wife, ruling their children and their own
houses well.
13 For those who have served well as
deacons obtain for themselves a good
standing and great boldness in the faith
which is in Christ Jesus.
14 These things I write to you, though I
hope to come to you shortly;
15 but if I am delayed, I write so that you
may know how you ought to conduct
yourself in the house of God, which is
the church of the living God, the pillar
and ground of the truth.
16 And without controversy great is
the mystery of godliness: God was
manifested in the ﬂesh, Jus ﬁed in the
Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among1 TIMOTHY 4
9
the Gen les, Believed on in the world,
Received up in glory.
1 Now the Spirit expressly says that
in la er mes some will depart from
the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits
and doctrines of demons,
2 speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their
own conscience seared with a hot iron,
3 forbidding to marry, and commanding
to abstain from foods which God created
to be received with thanksgiving by
those who believe and know the truth.
4 For every creature of God is good, and
nothing is to be refused if it is received
with thanksgiving;
5 for it is sanc ﬁed by the word of God
and prayer.
6 If you instruct the brethren in these
things, you will be a good minister of
Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of
faith and of the good doctrine which you
have carefully followed.
41 TIMOTHY 4
10
7 But reject profane and old wives’
fables, and exercise yourself toward
godliness.
8 For bodily exercise proﬁts a li le, but
godliness is proﬁtable for all things,
having promise of the life that now is
and of that which is to come.
9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of
all acceptance.
10 For to this end we both labor and
suﬀer reproach, because we trust in the
living God, who is the Savior of all men,
especially of those who believe.
11 These things command and teach.
12 Let no one despise your youth, but
be an example to the believers in word,
in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in
purity.
13 Till I come, give a en on to reading,
to exhorta on, to doctrine.
14 Do not neglect the gi that is in you,
which was given to you by prophecy1 TIMOTHY 4 – 5
11
with the laying on of the hands of the
eldership.
15 Meditate on these things; give
yourself en rely to them, that your
progress may be evident to all.
16 Take heed to yourself and to the
doctrine. Con nue in them, for in doing
this you will save both yourself and
those who hear you.
1 Do not rebuke an older man, but
exhort him as a father, younger men
as brothers,
2 older women as mothers, younger as
sisters, with all purity.
3 Honor widows who are really widows.
4 But if any widow has children or
grandchildren, let them ﬁrst learn to
show piety at home and to repay their
parents; for this is good and acceptable
before God.
51 TIMOTHY 5
12
5 Now she who is really a widow, and
le alone, trusts in God and con nues in
supplica ons and prayers night and day.
6 But she who lives in pleasure is dead
while she lives.
7 And these things command, that they
may be blameless.
8 But if anyone does not provide for
his own, and especially for those of his
household, he has denied the faith and
is worse than an unbeliever.
9 Do not let a widow under sixty years
old be taken into the number, and not
unless she has been the wife of one
man,
10 well reported for good works: if
she has brought up children, if she has
lodged strangers, if she has washed
the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the
aﬄicted, if she has diligently followed
every good work.1 TIMOTHY 5
13
11 But refuse the younger widows; for
when they have begun to grow wanton
against Christ, they desire to marry,
12 having condemna on because they
have cast oﬀ their ﬁrst faith.
13 And besides they learn to be idle,
wandering about from house to house,
and not only idle but also gossips and
busybodies, saying things which they
ought not.
14 Therefore I desire that the younger
widows marry, bear children, manage
the house, give no opportunity to the
adversary to speak reproachfully.
15 For some have already turned aside
a er Satan.
16 If any believing man or woman has
widows, let them relieve them, and
do not let the church be burdened,
that it may relieve those who are really
widows.1 TIMOTHY 5
14
17 Let the elders who rule well be
counted worthy of double honor,
especially those who labor in the word
and doctrine.
18 For the Scripture says, "You shall not
muzzle an ox while it treads out the
grain," and, "The laborer is worthy of his
wages."
19 Do not receive an accusa on against
an elder except from two or three
witnesses.
20 Those who are sinning rebuke in the
presence of all, that the rest also may
fear.
21 I charge you before God and the Lord
Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you
observe these things without prejudice,
doing nothing with par ality.
22 Do not lay hands on anyone has ly,
nor share in other people’s sins; keep
yourself pure.1 TIMOTHY 5 – 6
15
23 No longer drink only water, but use a
li le wine for your stomach’s sake and
your frequent inﬁrmi es.
24 Some men’s sins are clearly evident,
preceding them to judgment, but those
of some men follow later.
25 Likewise, the good works of some
are clearly evident, and those that are
otherwise cannot be hidden.
1 Let as many bondservants as are
under the yoke count their own
masters worthy of all honor, so that the
name of God and His doctrine may not
be blasphemed.
2 And those who have believing
masters, let them not despise them
because they are brethren, but rather
serve them because those who are
beneﬁted are believers and beloved.
Teach and exhort these things.
3 If anyone teaches otherwise and
does not consent to wholesome words,
61 TIMOTHY 6
16
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and to the doctrine which accords with
godliness,
4 he is proud, knowing nothing, but is
obsessed with disputes and arguments
over words, from which come envy,
strife, reviling, evil suspicions,
5 useless wranglings of men of corrupt
minds and des tute of the truth, who
suppose that godliness is a means of
gain. From such withdraw yourself.
6 Now godliness with contentment is
great gain.
7 For we brought nothing into this
world, and it is certain we can carry
nothing out.
8 And having food and clothing, with
these we shall be content.
9 But those who desire to be rich fall
into tempta on and a snare, and into
many foolish and harmful lusts which
drown men in destruc on and perdi on.1 TIMOTHY 6
17
10 For the love of money is a root
of all kinds of evil, for which some
have strayed from the faith in their
greediness, and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows.
11 But you, O man of God, ﬂee these
things and pursue righteousness,
godliness, faith, love, pa ence,
gentleness.
12 Fight the good ﬁght of faith, lay hold
on eternal life, to which you were also
called and have confessed the good
confession in the presence of many
witnesses.
13 I urge you in the sight of God who
gives life to all things, and before
Christ Jesus who witnessed the good
confession before Pon us Pilate,
14 that you keep this commandment
without spot, blameless un l our Lord
Jesus Christ’s appearing,1 TIMOTHY 6
18
15 which He will manifest in His own
me, He who is the blessed and only
Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of
lords,
16 who alone has immortality, dwelling
in unapproachable light, whom no man
has seen or can see, to whom be honor
and everlas ng power. Amen.
17 Command those who are rich in this
present age not to be haughty, nor to
trust in uncertain riches but in the living
God, who gives us richly all things to
enjoy.
18 Let them do good, that they be rich
in good works, ready to give, willing to
share,
19 storing up for themselves a good
founda on for the me to come, that
they may lay hold on eternal life.
20 O Timothy! Guard what was
commi ed to your trust, avoiding
the profane and idle babblings and1 TIMOTHY 6
19
contradic ons of what is falsely called
knowledge––
21 by professing it some have strayed
concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
Amen.2 Timothy
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
the will of God, according to the
promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
2 To Timothy, a beloved son: Grace,
mercy, and peace from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3 I thank God, whom I serve with a pure
conscience, as my forefathers did, as
without ceasing I remember you in my
prayers night and day,
4 greatly desiring to see you, being
mindful of your tears, that I may be ﬁlled
with joy,
5 when I call to remembrance the
genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt
ﬁrst in your grandmother Lois and your
mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in
you also.2 TIMOTHY 1
6 Therefore I remind you to s
2
r up the
gi of God which is in you through the
laying on of my hands.
7 For God has not given us a spirit of
fear, but of power and of love and of a
sound mind.
8 Therefore do not be ashamed of
the tes mony of our Lord, nor of me
His prisoner, but share with me in the
suﬀerings for the gospel according to the
power of God,
9 who has saved us and called us with a
holy calling, not according to our works,
but according to His own purpose and
grace which was given to us in Christ
Jesus before me began,
10 but has now been revealed by the
appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who
has abolished death and brought life and
immortality to light through the gospel,
11 to which I was appointed a preacher,
an apostle, and a teacher of the Gen les.2 TIMOTHY 1
3
12 For this reason I also suﬀer these
things; nevertheless I am not ashamed,
for I know whom I have believed and am
persuaded that He is able to keep what I
have commi ed to Him un l that Day.
13 Hold fast the pa ern of sound words
which you have heard from me, in faith
and love which are in Christ Jesus.
14 That good thing which was
commi ed to you, keep by the Holy
Spirit who dwells in us.
15 This you know, that all those in Asia
have turned away from me, among
whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
16 The Lord grant mercy to the
household of Onesiphorus, for he o en
refreshed me, and was not ashamed of
my chain;
17 but when he arrived in Rome, he
sought me out very zealously and found
me.2 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
4
18 The Lord grant to him that he
may ﬁnd mercy from the Lord in that
Day––and you know very well how many
ways he ministered to me at Ephesus.
1 You therefore, my son, be strong in
the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 And the things that you have heard
from me among many witnesses,
commit these to faithful men who will
be able to teach others also.
3 You therefore must endure hardship
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
4 No one engaged in warfare entangles
himself with the aﬀairs of this life, that
he may please him who enlisted him as
a soldier.
5 And also if anyone competes in
athle cs, he is not crowned unless he
competes according to the rules.
6 The hard–working farmer must be
ﬁrst to partake of the crops.
22 TIMOTHY 2
5
7 Consider what I say, and may the Lord
give you understanding in all things.
8 Remember that Jesus Christ, of the
seed of David, was raised from the dead
according to my gospel,
9 for which I suﬀer trouble as an
evildoer, even to the point of chains; but
the word of God is not chained.
10 Therefore I endure all things for the
sake of the elect, that they also may
obtain the salva on which is in Christ
Jesus with eternal glory.
11 This is a faithful saying: For if we died
with Him, We shall also live with Him.
12 If we endure, We shall also reign with
Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny
us.
13 If we are faithless, He remains
faithful; He cannot deny Himself.
14 Remind them of these things,
charging them before the Lord not to2 TIMOTHY 2
6
strive about words to no proﬁt, to the
ruin of the hearers.
15 Be diligent to present yourself
approved to God, a worker who does
not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing
the word of truth.
16 But shun profane and idle babblings,
for they will increase to more
ungodliness.
17 And their message will spread like
cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of
this sort,
18 who have strayed concerning the
truth, saying that the resurrec on is
already past; and they overthrow the
faith of some.
19 Nevertheless the solid founda on of
God stands, having this seal: "The Lord
knows those who are His," and, "Let
everyone who names the name of Christ
depart from iniquity."2 TIMOTHY 2
7
20 But in a great house there are not
only vessels of gold and silver, but also
of wood and clay, some for honor and
some for dishonor.
21 Therefore if anyone cleanses himself
from the la er, he will be a vessel for
honor, sanc ﬁed and useful for the
Master, prepared for every good work.
22 Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue
righteousness, faith, love, peace with
those who call on the Lord out of a pure
heart.
23 But avoid foolish and ignorant
disputes, knowing that they generate
strife.
24 And a servant of the Lord must not
quarrel but be gentle to all, able to
teach, pa ent,
25 in humility correc ng those who are
in opposi on, if God perhaps will grant
them repentance, so that they may
know the truth,2 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
8
26 and that they may come to their
senses and escape the snare of the devil,
having been taken cap ve by him to do
his will.
1 But know this, that in the last days
perilous mes will come:
2 For men will be lovers of themselves,
lovers of money, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy,
3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers,
without self–control, brutal, despisers of
good,
4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers
of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
5 having a form of godliness but denying
its power. And from such people turn
away!
6 For of this sort are those who creep
into households and make cap ves of
gullible women loaded down with sins,
led away by various lusts,
32 TIMOTHY 3
9
7 always learning and never able to
come to the knowledge of the truth.
8 Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted
Moses, so do these also resist the truth:
men of corrupt minds, disapproved
concerning the faith;
9 but they will progress no further, for
their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs
also was.
10 But you have carefully followed my
doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith,
longsuﬀering, love, perseverance,
11 persecu ons, aﬄic ons, which
happened to me at An och, at Iconium,
at Lystra––what persecu ons I endured.
And out of them all the Lord delivered
me.
12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly
in Christ Jesus will suﬀer persecu on.
13 But evil men and impostors will grow
worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived.2 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
14 But you must con
10
nue in the things
which you have learned and been
assured of, knowing from whom you
have learned them,
15 and that from childhood you have
known the Holy Scriptures, which are
able to make you wise for salva on
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
16 All Scripture is given by inspira on of
God, and is proﬁtable for doctrine, for
reproof, for correc on, for instruc on in
righteousness,
17 that the man of God may be
complete, thoroughly equipped for
every good work.
1 I charge you therefore before God
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will
judge the living and the dead at His
appearing and His kingdom:
2 Preach the word! Be ready in season
and out of season. Convince, rebuke,
42 TIMOTHY 4
11
exhort, with all longsuﬀering and
teaching.
3 For the me will come when they
will not endure sound doctrine, but
according to their own desires, because
they have itching ears, they will heap up
for themselves teachers;
4 and they will turn their ears away
from the truth, and be turned aside to
fables.
5 But you be watchful in all things,
endure aﬄic ons, do the work of an
evangelist, fulﬁll your ministry.
6 For I am already being poured out
as a drink oﬀering, and the me of my
departure is at hand.
7 I have fought the good ﬁght, I have
ﬁnished the race, I have kept the faith.
8 Finally, there is laid up for me the
crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous Judge, will give to me on2 TIMOTHY 4
12
that Day, and not to me only but also to
all who have loved His appearing.
9 Be diligent to come to me quickly;
10 for Demas has forsaken me, having
loved this present world, and has
departed for Thessalonica––Crescens for
Gala a, Titus for Dalma a.
11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and
bring him with you, for he is useful to me
for ministry.
12 And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
13 Bring the cloak that I le with Carpus
at Troas when you come––and the
books, especially the parchments.
14 Alexander the coppersmith did me
much harm. May the Lord repay him
according to his works.
15 You also must beware of him, for he
has greatly resisted our words.
16 At my ﬁrst defense no one stood with
me, but all forsook me. May it not be
charged against them.2 TIMOTHY 4

17 But the Lord stood with me and
strengthened me, so that the message
might be preached fully through me,
and that all the Gen les might hear. And
I was delivered out of the mouth of the
lion.
18 And the Lord will deliver me from
every evil work and preserve me for
His heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory
forever and ever. Amen!

1 Paul, a bondservant of God and
an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
to the faith of God’s elect and the
acknowledgment of the truth which
accords with godliness,
2 in hope of eternal life which God, who
cannot lie, promised before me began,
3 but has in due me manifested His
word through preaching, which was
commi ed to me according to the
commandment of God our Savior;
4 To Titus, a true son in our common
faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
Savior.
5 For this reason I le you in Crete, that
you should set in order the things thatTITUS 1
2
are lacking, and appoint elders in every
city as I commanded you––
6 if a man is blameless, the husband of
one wife, having faithful children
not accused of dissipa on or
insubordina on.
7 For a bishop must be blameless, as
a steward of God, not self–willed, not
quick–tempered, not given to wine, not
violent, not greedy for money,
8 but hospitable, a lover of what
is good, sober–minded, just, holy,
self–controlled,
9 holding fast the faithful word as he
has been taught, that he may be able,
by sound doctrine, both to exhort and
convict those who contradict.
10 For there are many insubordinate,
both idle talkers and deceivers, especially
those of the circumcision,
11 whose mouths must be stopped, who
subvert whole households, teachingTITUS 1 – 2
3
things which they ought not, for the sake
of dishonest gain.
12 One of them, a prophet of their
own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil
beasts, lazy glu ons."
13 This tes mony is true. Therefore
rebuke them sharply, that they may be
sound in the faith,
14 not giving heed to Jewish fables and
commandments of men who turn from
the truth.
15 To the pure all things are pure, but to
those who are deﬁled and unbelieving
nothing is pure; but even their mind and
conscience are deﬁled.
16 They profess to know God, but in
works they deny Him, being abominable,
disobedient, and disqualiﬁed for every
good work.
1 But as for you, speak the things
which are proper for sound doctrine:
2TITUS 2
4
2 that the older men be sober, reverent,
temperate, sound in faith, in love, in
pa ence;
3 the older women likewise, that they
be reverent in behavior, not slanderers,
not given to much wine, teachers of
good things––
4 that they admonish the young women
to love their husbands, to love their
children,
5 to be discreet, chaste, homemakers,
good, obedient to their own husbands,
that the word of God may not be
blasphemed.
6 Likewise exhort the young men to be
sober–minded,
7 in all things showing yourself
to be a pa ern of good works; in
doctrine showing integrity, reverence,
incorrup bility,
8 sound speech that cannot be
condemned, that one who is anTITUS 2
5
opponent may be ashamed, having
nothing evil to say of you.
9 Exhort bondservants to be obedient
to their own masters, to be well pleasing
in all things, not answering back,
10 not pilfering, but showing all good
ﬁdelity, that they may adorn the doctrine
of God our Savior in all things.
11 For the grace of God that brings
salva on has appeared to all men,
12 teaching us that, denying ungodliness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly in the present
age,
13 looking for the blessed hope and
glorious appearing of our great God and
Savior Jesus Christ,
14 who gave Himself for us, that He
might redeem us from every lawless
deed and purify for Himself His own
special people, zealous for good works.TITUS 2 – 3
6
15 Speak these things, exhort, and
rebuke with all authority. Let no one
despise you.
1 Remind them to be subject to rulers
and authori es, to obey, to be ready
for every good work,
2 to speak evil of no one, to be
peaceable, gentle, showing all humility
to all men.
3 For we ourselves were also once
foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
various lusts and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful and ha ng one
another.
4 But when the kindness and the love of
God our Savior toward man appeared,
5 not by works of righteousness which
we have done, but according to His
mercy He saved us, through the washing
of regenera on and renewing of the
Holy Spirit,
3TITUS 3
7
6 whom He poured out on us
abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Savior,
7 that having been jus ﬁed by His grace
we should become heirs according to
the hope of eternal life.
8 This is a faithful saying, and these
things I want you to aﬃrm constantly,
that those who have believed in God
should be careful to maintain good
works. These things are good and
proﬁtable to men.
9 But avoid foolish disputes,
genealogies, conten ons, and strivings
about the law; for they are unproﬁtable
and useless.
10 Reject a divisive man a er the ﬁrst
and second admoni on,
11 knowing that such a person is warped
and sinning, being self–condemned.
12 When I send Artemas to you, or
Tychicus, be diligent to come to me atTITUS 3
8
Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend
the winter there.
13 Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos
on their journey with haste, that they
may lack nothing.
14 And let our people also learn to
maintain good works, to meet urgent
needs, that they may not be unfrui ul.
15 All who are with me greet you. Greet
those who love us in the faith. Grace be
with you all. Amen.Philemon

1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timothy our brother, To Philemon
our beloved friend and fellow laborer,
2 to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our
fellow soldier, and to the church in your
house:
3 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I thank my God, making men on of
you always in my prayers,
5 hearing of your love and faith which
you have toward the Lord Jesus and
toward all the saints,
6 that the sharing of your faith
may become eﬀec ve by the
acknowledgment of every good
thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.PHILEMON 1
7 For we have great joy and consola
2
on
in your love, because the hearts of
the saints have been refreshed by you,
brother.
8 Therefore, though I might be very
bold in Christ to command you what is
ﬁ ng,
9 yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to
you ––being such a one as Paul, the
aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus
Christ––
10 I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,
whom I have bego en while in my
chains,
11 who once was unproﬁtable to you,
but now is proﬁtable to you and to me.
12 I am sending him back. You therefore
receive him, that is, my own heart,
13 whom I wished to keep with me, that
on your behalf he might minister to me
in my chains for the gospel.PHILEMON 1
3
14 But without your consent I wanted to
do nothing, that your good deed might
not be by compulsion, as it were, but
voluntary.
15 For perhaps he departed for a while
for this purpose, that you might receive
him forever,
16 no longer as a slave but more than a
slave––a beloved brother, especially to
me but how much more to you, both in
the ﬂesh and in the Lord.
17 If then you count me as a partner,
receive him as you would me.
18 But if he has wronged you or owes
anything, put that on my account.
19 I, Paul, am wri ng with my own hand.
I will repay––not to men on to you that
you owe me even your own self besides.
20 Yes, brother, let me have joy from
you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the
Lord.PHILEMON 1
4
21 Having conﬁdence in your obedience,
I write to you, knowing that you will do
even more than I say.
22 But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest
room for me, for I trust that through
your prayers I shall be granted to you.
23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in
Christ Jesus, greets you,
24 as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas,
Luke, my fellow laborers.
25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit. Amen.Hebrews
1 God, who at various
mes and in
various ways spoke in me past to
the fathers by the prophets,
2 has in these last days spoken to us by
His Son, whom He has appointed heir of
all things, through whom also He made
the worlds;
3 who being the brightness of His glory
and the express image of His person, and
upholding all things by the word of His
power, when He had by Himself purged
our sins, sat down at the right hand of
the Majesty on high,
4 having become so much be er than
the angels, as He has by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than
they.
1HEBREWS 1
2
5 For to which of the angels did He
ever say: "You are My Son, Today I have
bego en You"? And again: "I will be to
Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a
Son"?
6 But when He again brings the ﬁrstborn
into the world, He says: "Let all the
angels of God worship Him."
7 And of the angels He says: "Who
makes His angels spirits And His ministers
a ﬂame of ﬁre."
8 But to the Son He says: "Your throne,
O God, is forever and ever; A scepter
of righteousness is the scepter of Your
Kingdom.
9 You have loved righteousness and
hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your
God, has anointed You With the oil of
gladness more than Your companions."
10 And: "You, LORD, in the beginning
laid the founda on of the earth, And the
heavens are the work of Your hands.HEBREWS 1 – 2
3
11 They will perish, but You remain; And
they will all grow old like a garment;
12 Like a cloak You will fold them up,
And they will be changed. But You are
the same, And Your years will not fail."
13 But to which of the angels has He
ever said: "Sit at My right hand, Till I
make Your enemies Your footstool"?
14 Are they not all ministering spirits
sent forth to minister for those who will
inherit salva on?
1 Therefore we must give the more
earnest heed to the things we have
heard, lest we dri away.
2 For if the word spoken through
angels proved steadfast, and every
transgression and disobedience received
a just reward,
3 how shall we escape if we neglect
so great a salva on, which at the ﬁrst
began to be spoken by the Lord, and
2HEBREWS 2
4
was conﬁrmed to us by those who heard
Him,
4 God also bearing witness both
with signs and wonders, with various
miracles, and gi s of the Holy Spirit,
according to His own will?
5 For He has not put the world to come,
of which we speak, in subjec on to
angels.
6 But one tes ﬁed in a certain place,
saying: "What is man that You are
mindful of him, Or the son of man that
You take care of him?
7 You have made him a li le lower than
the angels; You have crowned him with
glory and honor, And set him over the
works of Your hands.
8 You have put all things in subjec on
under his feet." For in that He put all in
subjec on under him, He le nothing
that is not put under him. But now we
do not yet see all things put under him.HEBREWS 2
5
9 But we see Jesus, who was made
a li le lower than the angels, for the
suﬀering of death crowned with glory
and honor, that He, by the grace of God,
might taste death for everyone.
10 For it was ﬁ ng for Him, for whom
are all things and by whom are all things,
in bringing many sons to glory, to make
the captain of their salva on perfect
through suﬀerings.
11 For both He who sanc ﬁes and those
who are being sanc ﬁed are all of one,
for which reason He is not ashamed to
call them brethren,
12 saying: "I will declare Your name
to My brethren; In the midst of the
assembly I will sing praise to You."
13 And again: "I will put My trust in
Him." And again: "Here am I and the
children whom God has given Me."
14 Inasmuch then as the children have
partaken of ﬂesh and blood, He HimselfHEBREWS 2 – 3
6
likewise shared in the same, that through
death He might destroy him who had
the power of death, that is, the devil,
15 and release those who through fear
of death were all their life me subject to
bondage.
16 For indeed He does not give aid to
angels, but He does give aid to the seed
of Abraham.
17 Therefore, in all things He had to be
made like His brethren, that He might
be a merciful and faithful High Priest
in things pertaining to God, to make
propi a on for the sins of the people.
18 For in that He Himself has suﬀered,
being tempted, He is able to aid those
who are tempted.
1 Therefore, holy brethren, partakers
of the heavenly calling, consider
the Apostle and High Priest of our
confession, Christ Jesus,
3HEBREWS 3
7
2 who was faithful to Him who
appointed Him, as Moses also was
faithful in all His house.
3 For this One has been counted worthy
of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as
He who built the house has more honor
than the house.
4 For every house is built by someone,
but He who built all things is God.
5 And Moses indeed was faithful in all
His house as a servant, for a tes mony
of those things which would be spoken
a erward,
6 but Christ as a Son over His own
house, whose house we are if we hold
fast the conﬁdence and the rejoicing of
the hope ﬁrm to the end.
7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:
"Today, if you will hear His voice,
8 Do not harden your hearts as in
the rebellion, In the day of trial in the
wilderness,HEBREWS 3
8
9 Where your fathers tested Me, tried
Me, And saw My works forty years.
10 Therefore I was angry with that
genera on, And said, ‘They always go
astray in their heart, And they have not
known My ways.’
11 So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall
not enter My rest.’"
12 Beware, brethren, lest there be in
any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
depar ng from the living God;
13 but exhort one another daily, while
it is called "Today," lest any of you be
hardened through the decei ulness of
sin.
14 For we have become partakers of
Christ if we hold the beginning of our
conﬁdence steadfast to the end,
15 while it is said: "Today, if you will hear
His voice, Do not harden your hearts as
in the rebellion."HEBREWS 3 – 4
9
16 For who, having heard, rebelled?
Indeed, was it not all who came out of
Egypt, led by Moses?
17 Now with whom was He angry forty
years? Was it not with those who sinned,
whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
18 And to whom did He swear that they
would not enter His rest, but to those
who did not obey?
19 So we see that they could not enter
in because of unbelief.
1 Therefore, since a promise remains
of entering His rest, let us fear lest
any of you seem to have come short of
it.
2 For indeed the gospel was preached
to us as well as to them; but the word
which they heard did not proﬁt them,
not being mixed with faith in those who
heard it.
3 For we who have believed do enter
that rest, as He has said: "So I swore
4HEBREWS 4
10
in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My
rest,’" although the works were ﬁnished
from the founda on of the world.
4 For He has spoken in a certain place
of the seventh day in this way: "And God
rested on the seventh day from all His
works";
5 and again in this place: "They shall not
enter My rest."
6 Since therefore it remains that some
must enter it, and those to whom it was
ﬁrst preached did not enter because of
disobedience,
7 again He designates a certain day,
saying in David, "Today," a er such a
long me, as it has been said: "Today, if
you will hear His voice, Do not harden
your hearts."
8 For if Joshua had given them rest, then
He would not a erward have spoken of
another day.HEBREWS 4
11
9 There remains therefore a rest for the
people of God.
10 For he who has entered His rest has
himself also ceased from his works as
God did from His.
11 Let us therefore be diligent to enter
that rest, lest anyone fall according to
the same example of disobedience.
12 For the word of God is living
and powerful, and sharper than any
two–edged sword, piercing even to the
division of soul and spirit, and of joints
and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart.
13 And there is no creature hidden from
His sight, but all things are naked and
open to the eyes of Him to whom we
must give account.
14 Seeing then that we have a great
High Priest who has passed through the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold fast our confession.HEBREWS 4 – 5
12
15 For we do not have a High Priest who
cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
but was in all points tempted as we are,
yet without sin.
16 Let us therefore come boldly to the
throne of grace, that we may obtain
mercy and ﬁnd grace to help in me of
need.
1 For every high priest taken from
among men is appointed for men in
things pertaining to God, that he may
oﬀer both gi s and sacriﬁces for sins.
2 He can have compassion on those
who are ignorant and going astray, since
he himself is also subject to weakness.
3 Because of this he is required as for
the people, so also for himself, to oﬀer
sacriﬁces for sins.
4 And no man takes this honor to
himself, but he who is called by God, just
as Aaron was.
5HEBREWS 5
13
5 So also Christ did not glorify Himself
to become High Priest, but it was He
who said to Him: "You are My Son, Today
I have bego en You."
6 As He also says in another place: "You
are a priest forever According to the
order of Melchizedek";
7 who, in the days of His ﬂesh, when He
had oﬀered up prayers and supplica ons,
with vehement cries and tears to Him
who was able to save Him from death,
and was heard because of His godly fear,
8 though He was a Son, yet He learned
obedience by the things which He
suﬀered.
9 And having been perfected, He
became the author of eternal salva on
to all who obey Him,
10 called by God as High Priest
"according to the order of Melchizedek,"HEBREWS 5 – 6
14
11 of whom we have much to say, and
hard to explain, since you have become
dull of hearing.
12 For though by this me you ought
to be teachers, you need someone to
teach you again the ﬁrst principles of the
oracles of God; and you have come to
need milk and not solid food.
13 For everyone who partakes only
of milk is unskilled in the word of
righteousness, for he is a babe.
14 But solid food belongs to those who
are of full age, that is, those who by
reason of use have their senses exercised
to discern both good and evil.
1 Therefore, leaving the discussion of
the elementary principles of Christ,
let us go on to perfec on, not laying
again the founda on of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God,
6HEBREWS 6
2 of the doctrine of bap
15
sms, of laying
on of hands, of resurrec on of the dead,
and of eternal judgment.
3 And this we will do if God permits.
4 For it is impossible for those who
were once enlightened, and have tasted
the heavenly gi , and have become
partakers of the Holy Spirit,
5 and have tasted the good word of God
and the powers of the age to come,
6 if they fall away, to renew them again
to repentance, since they crucify again
for themselves the Son of God, and put
Him to an open shame.
7 For the earth which drinks in the rain
that o en comes upon it, and bears
herbs useful for those by whom it is
cul vated, receives blessing from God;
8 but if it bears thorns and briars, it
is rejected and near to being cursed,
whose end is to be burned.HEBREWS 6
16
9 But, beloved, we are conﬁdent of
be er things concerning you, yes, things
that accompany salva on, though we
speak in this manner.
10 For God is not unjust to forget your
work and labor of love which you have
shown toward His name, in that you
have ministered to the saints, and do
minister.
11 And we desire that each one of you
show the same diligence to the full
assurance of hope un l the end,
12 that you do not become sluggish,
but imitate those who through faith and
pa ence inherit the promises.
13 For when God made a promise to
Abraham, because He could swear by no
one greater, He swore by Himself,
14 saying, "Surely blessing I will bless
you, and mul plying I will mul ply you."
15 And so, a er he had pa ently
endured, he obtained the promise.HEBREWS 6 – 7
17
16 For men indeed swear by the greater,
and an oath for conﬁrma on is for them
an end of all dispute.
17 Thus God, determining to show more
abundantly to the heirs of promise the
immutability of His counsel, conﬁrmed it
by an oath,
18 that by two immutable things, in
which it is impossible for God to lie, we
might have strong consola on, who have
ﬂed for refuge to lay hold of the hope set
before us.
19 This hope we have as an anchor of
the soul, both sure and steadfast, and
which enters the Presence behind the
veil,
20 where the forerunner has entered
for us, even Jesus, having become High
Priest forever according to the order of
Melchizedek.
1 For this Melchizedek, king of
Salem, priest of the Most High God,
7HEBREWS 7
18
who met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
2 to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
part of all, ﬁrst being translated "king
of righteousness," and then also king of
Salem, meaning "king of peace,"
3 without father, without mother,
without genealogy, having neither
beginning of days nor end of life, but
made like the Son of God, remains a
priest con nually.
4 Now consider how great this man was,
to whom even the patriarch Abraham
gave a tenth of the spoils.
5 And indeed those who are of the sons
of Levi, who receive the priesthood,
have a commandment to receive thes
from the people according to the law,
that is, from their brethren, though they
have come from the loins of Abraham;HEBREWS 7
19
6 but he whose genealogy is not derived
from them received thes from Abraham
and blessed him who had the promises.
7 Now beyond all contradic on the
lesser is blessed by the be er.
8 Here mortal men receive thes, but
there he receives them, of whom it is
witnessed that he lives.
9 Even Levi, who receives thes, paid
thes through Abraham, so to speak,
10 for he was s ll in the loins of his
father when Melchizedek met him.
11 Therefore, if perfec on were through
the Levi cal priesthood (for under it
the people received the law), what
further need was there that another
priest should rise according to the
order of Melchizedek, and not be called
according to the order of Aaron?
12 For the priesthood being changed, of
necessity there is also a change of the
law.HEBREWS 7
20
13 For He of whom these things are
spoken belongs to another tribe, from
which no man has oﬃciated at the altar.
14 For it is evident that our Lord arose
from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke
nothing concerning priesthood.
15 And it is yet far more evident if, in
the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises
another priest
16 who has come, not according to the
law of a ﬂeshly commandment, but
according to the power of an endless
life.
17 For He tes ﬁes: "You are a priest
forever According to the order of
Melchizedek."
18 For on the one hand there
is an annulling of the former
commandment because of its weakness
and unproﬁtableness,
19 for the law made nothing perfect; on
the other hand, there is the bringing inHEBREWS 7
21
of a be er hope, through which we draw
near to God.
20 And inasmuch as He was not made
priest without an oath
21 (for they have become priests
without an oath, but He with an oath
by Him who said to Him: "The LORD has
sworn And will not relent, ‘You are a
priest forever According to the order of
Melchizedek’ "),
22 by so much more Jesus has become a
surety of a be er covenant.
23 Also there were many priests,
because they were prevented by death
from con nuing.
24 But He, because He con nues forever,
has an unchangeable priesthood.
25 Therefore He is also able to save to
the u ermost those who come to God
through Him, since He always lives to
make intercession for them.HEBREWS 7 – 8
26 For such a High Priest was ﬁ
22
ng for
us, who is holy, harmless, undeﬁled,
separate from sinners, and has become
higher than the heavens;
27 who does not need daily, as those
high priests, to oﬀer up sacriﬁces,
ﬁrst for His own sins and then for the
people’s, for this He did once for all
when He oﬀered up Himself.
28 For the law appoints as high priests
men who have weakness, but the word
of the oath, which came a er the
law, appoints the Son who has been
perfected forever.
1 Now this is the main point of the
things we are saying: We have such
a High Priest, who is seated at the right
hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
heavens,
2 a Minister of the sanctuary and of the
true tabernacle which the Lord erected,
and not man.
8HEBREWS 8
23
3 For every high priest is appointed to
oﬀer both gi s and sacriﬁces. Therefore
it is necessary that this One also have
something to oﬀer.
4 For if He were on earth, He would not
be a priest, since there are priests who
oﬀer the gi s according to the law;
5 who serve the copy and shadow of the
heavenly things, as Moses was divinely
instructed when he was about to make
the tabernacle. For He said, "See that
you make all things according to the
pa ern shown you on the mountain."
6 But now He has obtained a more
excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also
Mediator of a be er covenant, which
was established on be er promises.
7 For if that ﬁrst covenant had been
faultless, then no place would have been
sought for a second.
8 Because ﬁnding fault with them, He
says: "Behold, the days are coming,HEBREWS 8
24
says the LORD, when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and
with the house of Judah––
9 "not according to the covenant that I
made with their fathers in the day when
I took them by the hand to lead them
out of the land of Egypt; because they
did not con nue in My covenant, and I
disregarded them, says the LORD.
10 "For this is the covenant that I will
make with the house of Israel a er those
days, says the LORD: I will put My laws
in their mind and write them on their
hearts; and I will be their God, and they
shall be My people.
11 "None of them shall teach his
neighbor, and none his brother, saying,
‘Know the LORD,’ for all shall know Me,
from the least of them to the greatest of
them.HEBREWS 8 – 9
25
12 "For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and their
lawless deeds I will remember no more."
13 In that He says, "A new covenant,"
He has made the ﬁrst obsolete. Now
what is becoming obsolete and growing
old is ready to vanish away.
1 Then indeed, even the ﬁrst
covenant had ordinances of divine
service and the earthly sanctuary.
2 For a tabernacle was prepared: the
ﬁrst part, in which was the lampstand,
the table, and the showbread, which is
called the sanctuary;
3 and behind the second veil, the part
of the tabernacle which is called the
Holiest of All,
4 which had the golden censer and the
ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides
with gold, in which were the golden pot
that had the manna, Aaron’s rod that
budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
9HEBREWS 9
26
5 and above it were the cherubim of
glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of
these things we cannot now speak in
detail.
6 Now when these things had been
thus prepared, the priests always went
into the ﬁrst part of the tabernacle,
performing the services.
7 But into the second part the high
priest went alone once a year, not
without blood, which he oﬀered for
himself and for the people’s sins
commi ed in ignorance;
8 the Holy Spirit indica ng this, that the
way into the Holiest of All was not yet
made manifest while the ﬁrst tabernacle
was s ll standing.
9 It was symbolic for the present me
in which both gi s and sacriﬁces are
oﬀered which cannot make him who
performed the service perfect in regard
to the conscience––HEBREWS 9
27
10 concerned only with foods and
drinks, various washings, and ﬂeshly
ordinances imposed un l the me of
reforma on.
11 But Christ came as High Priest of the
good things to come, with the greater
and more perfect tabernacle not made
with hands, that is, not of this crea on.
12 Not with the blood of goats and
calves, but with His own blood He
entered the Most Holy Place once for all,
having obtained eternal redemp on.
13 For if the blood of bulls and goats
and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the
unclean, sanc ﬁes for the purifying of
the ﬂesh,
14 how much more shall the blood of
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
oﬀered Himself without spot to God,
cleanse your conscience from dead
works to serve the living God?HEBREWS 9
28
15 And for this reason He is the Mediator
of the new covenant, by means of death,
for the redemp on of the transgressions
under the ﬁrst covenant, that those who
are called may receive the promise of
the eternal inheritance.
16 For where there is a testament, there
must also of necessity be the death of
the testator.
17 For a testament is in force a er men
are dead, since it has no power at all
while the testator lives.
18 Therefore not even the ﬁrst covenant
was dedicated without blood.
19 For when Moses had spoken every
precept to all the people according to
the law, he took the blood of calves
and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and
hyssop, and sprinkled both the book
itself and all the people,HEBREWS 9
29
20 saying, "This is the blood of the
covenant which God has commanded
you."
21 Then likewise he sprinkled with blood
both the tabernacle and all the vessels
of the ministry.
22 And according to the law almost
all things are puriﬁed with blood, and
without shedding of blood there is no
remission.
23 Therefore it was necessary that the
copies of the things in the heavens
should be puriﬁed with these, but the
heavenly things themselves with be er
sacriﬁces than these.
24 For Christ has not entered the holy
places made with hands, which are
copies of the true, but into heaven itself,
now to appear in the presence of God
for us;
25 not that He should oﬀer Himself
o en, as the high priest enters the MostHEBREWS 9 – 10
30
Holy Place every year with blood of
another––
26 He then would have had to suﬀer
o en since the founda on of the world;
but now, once at the end of the ages,
He has appeared to put away sin by the
sacriﬁce of Himself.
27 And as it is appointed for men to die
once, but a er this the judgment,
28 so Christ was oﬀered once to bear
the sins of many. To those who eagerly
wait for Him He will appear a second
me, apart from sin, for salva on.
1 For the law, having a shadow
of the good things to come, and
not the very image of the things, can
never with these same sacriﬁces, which
they oﬀer con nually year by year, make
those who approach perfect.
2 For then would they not have ceased
to be oﬀered? For the worshipers,
10HEBREWS 10
31
once puriﬁed, would have had no more
consciousness of sins.
3 But in those sacriﬁces there is a
reminder of sins every year.
4 For it is not possible that the blood of
bulls and goats could take away sins.
5 Therefore, when He came into the
world, He said: "Sacriﬁce and oﬀering
You did not desire, But a body You have
prepared for Me.
6 In burnt oﬀerings and sacriﬁces for sin
You had no pleasure.
7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come––In
the volume of the book it is wri en of
Me––To do Your will, O God.’"
8 Previously saying, "Sacriﬁce and
oﬀering, burnt oﬀerings, and oﬀerings
for sin You did not desire, nor had
pleasure in them" (which are oﬀered
according to the law),HEBREWS 10
32
9 then He said, "Behold, I have come to
do Your will, O God." He takes away the
ﬁrst that He may establish the second.
10 By that will we have been sanc ﬁed
through the oﬀering of the body of Jesus
Christ once for all.
11 And every priest stands ministering
daily and oﬀering repeatedly the same
sacriﬁces, which can never take away
sins.
12 But this Man, a er He had oﬀered
one sacriﬁce for sins forever, sat down at
the right hand of God,
13 from that me wai ng ll His
enemies are made His footstool.
14 For by one oﬀering He has perfected
forever those who are being sanc ﬁed.
15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to
us; for a er He had said before,
16 "This is the covenant that I will
make with them a er those days, says
the LORD: I will put My laws into theirHEBREWS 10
33
hearts, and in their minds I will write
them,"
17 then He adds, "Their sins and their
lawless deeds I will remember no more."
18 Now where there is remission of
these, there is no longer an oﬀering for
sin.
19 Therefore, brethren, having boldness
to enter the Holiest by the blood of
Jesus,
20 by a new and living way which He
consecrated for us, through the veil, that
is, His ﬂesh,
21 and having a High Priest over the
house of God,
22 let us draw near with a true heart in
full assurance of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience and
our bodies washed with pure water.
23 Let us hold fast the confession of
our hope without wavering, for He who
promised is faithful.HEBREWS 10
34
24 And let us consider one another in
order to s r up love and good works,
25 not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together, as is the manner of
some, but exhor ng one another, and
so much the more as you see the Day
approaching.
26 For if we sin willfully a er we have
received the knowledge of the truth,
there no longer remains a sacriﬁce for
sins,
27 but a certain fearful expecta on of
judgment, and ﬁery indigna on which
will devour the adversaries.
28 Anyone who has rejected Moses’ law
dies without mercy on the tes mony of
two or three witnesses.
29 Of how much worse punishment,
do you suppose, will he be thought
worthy who has trampled the Son of
God underfoot, counted the blood of
the covenant by which he was sanc ﬁedHEBREWS 10
35
a common thing, and insulted the Spirit
of grace?
30 For we know Him who said,
"Vengeance is Mine, I will repay," says
the Lord. And again, "The LORD will
judge His people."
31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.
32 But recall the former days in which,
a er you were illuminated, you endured
a great struggle with suﬀerings:
33 partly while you were made a
spectacle both by reproaches and
tribula ons, and partly while you
became companions of those who were
so treated;
34 for you had compassion on me in
my chains, and joyfully accepted the
plundering of your goods, knowing
that you have a be er and an enduring
possession for yourselves in heaven.HEBREWS 10 – 11
36
35 Therefore do not cast away your
conﬁdence, which has great reward.
36 For you have need of endurance, so
that a er you have done the will of God,
you may receive the promise:
37 "For yet a li le while, And He who is
coming will come and will not tarry.
38 Now the just shall live by faith; But
if anyone draws back, My soul has no
pleasure in him."
39 But we are not of those who draw
back to perdi on, but of those who
believe to the saving of the soul.
1 Now faith is the substance of
things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.
2 For by it the elders obtained a good
tes mony.
3 By faith we understand that the
worlds were framed by the word of God,
so that the things which are seen were
not made of things which are visible.
11HEBREWS 11
37
4 By faith Abel oﬀered to God a more
excellent sacriﬁce than Cain, through
which he obtained witness that he was
righteous, God tes fying of his gi s; and
through it he being dead s ll speaks.
5 By faith Enoch was taken away so
that he did not see death, "and was not
found, because God had taken him";
for before he was taken he had this
tes mony, that he pleased God.
6 But without faith it is impossible to
please Him, for he who comes to God
must believe that He is, and that He is
a rewarder of those who diligently seek
Him.
7 By faith Noah, being divinely warned
of things not yet seen, moved with
godly fear, prepared an ark for the
saving of his household, by which he
condemned the world and became heir
of the righteousness which is according
to faith.HEBREWS 11
38
8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he
was called to go out to the place which
he would receive as an inheritance. And
he went out, not knowing where he was
going.
9 By faith he dwelt in the land of
promise as in a foreign country, dwelling
in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs
with him of the same promise;
10 for he waited for the city which has
founda ons, whose builder and maker is
God.
11 By faith Sarah herself also received
strength to conceive seed, and she bore
a child when she was past the age,
because she judged Him faithful who
had promised.
12 Therefore from one man, and him
as good as dead, were born as many
as the stars of the sky in mul tude––
innumerable as the sand which is by the
seashore.HEBREWS 11
39
13 These all died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen
them afar oﬀ were assured of them,
embraced them and confessed that
they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth.
14 For those who say such things declare
plainly that they seek a homeland.
15 And truly if they had called to mind
that country from which they had come
out, they would have had opportunity to
return.
16 But now they desire a be er, that is,
a heavenly country. Therefore God is not
ashamed to be called their God, for He
has prepared a city for them.
17 By faith Abraham, when he was
tested, oﬀered up Isaac, and he who had
received the promises oﬀered up his
only bego en son,
18 of whom it was said, "In Isaac your
seed shall be called,"HEBREWS 11
40
19 concluding that God was able to raise
him up, even from the dead, from which
he also received him in a ﬁgura ve
sense.
20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning things to come.
21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying,
blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and
worshiped, leaning on the top of his
staﬀ.
22 By faith Joseph, when he was dying,
made men on of the departure of the
children of Israel, and gave instruc ons
concerning his bones.
23 By faith Moses, when he was born,
was hidden three months by his parents,
because they saw he was a beau ful
child; and they were not afraid of the
king’s command.
24 By faith Moses, when he became
of age, refused to be called the son of
Pharaoh’s daughter,HEBREWS 11
25 choosing rather to suﬀer aﬄic
41
on
with the people of God than to enjoy the
passing pleasures of sin,
26 esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures in
Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing
the wrath of the king; for he endured as
seeing Him who is invisible.
28 By faith he kept the Passover and
the sprinkling of blood, lest he who
destroyed the ﬁrstborn should touch
them.
29 By faith they passed through the
Red Sea as by dry land, whereas the
Egyp ans, a emp ng to do so, were
drowned.
30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down
a er they were encircled for seven days.
31 By faith the harlot Rahab did not
perish with those who did not believe,HEBREWS 11
42
when she had received the spies with
peace.
32 And what more shall I say? For the
me would fail me to tell of Gideon and
Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of
David and Samuel and the prophets:
33 who through faith subdued
kingdoms, worked righteousness,
obtained promises, stopped the mouths
of lions,
34 quenched the violence of ﬁre,
escaped the edge of the sword, out of
weakness were made strong, became
valiant in ba le, turned to ﬂight the
armies of the aliens.
35 Women received their dead raised to
life again. And others were tortured, not
accep ng deliverance, that they might
obtain a be er resurrec on.
36 S ll others had trial of mockings
and scourgings, yes, and of chains and
imprisonment.HEBREWS 11 – 12
43
37 They were stoned, they were sawn
in two, were tempted, were slain
with the sword. They wandered about
in sheepskins and goatskins, being
des tute, aﬄicted, tormented––
38 of whom the world was not
worthy. They wandered in deserts and
mountains, in dens and caves of the
earth.
39 And all these, having obtained a good
tes mony through faith, did not receive
the promise,
40 God having provided something
be er for us, that they should not be
made perfect apart from us.
1 Therefore we also, since we are
surrounded by so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight,
and the sin which so easily ensnares us,
and let us run with endurance the race
that is set before us,
12HEBREWS 12
44
2 looking unto Jesus, the author and
ﬁnisher of our faith, who for the joy that
was set before Him endured the cross,
despising the shame, and has sat down
at the right hand of the throne of God.
3 For consider Him who endured such
hos lity from sinners against Himself,
lest you become weary and discouraged
in your souls.
4 You have not yet resisted to
bloodshed, striving against sin.
5 And you have forgo en the
exhorta on which speaks to you as
to sons: "My son, do not despise
the chastening of the LORD, Nor be
discouraged when you are rebuked by
Him;
6 For whom the LORD loves He
chastens, And scourges every son whom
He receives."HEBREWS 12
45
7 If you endure chastening, God deals
with you as with sons; for what son is
there whom a father does not chasten?
8 But if you are without chastening, of
which all have become partakers, then
you are illegi mate and not sons.
9 Furthermore, we have had human
fathers who corrected us, and we paid
them respect. Shall we not much more
readily be in subjec on to the Father of
spirits and live?
10 For they indeed for a few days
chastened us as seemed best to them,
but He for our proﬁt, that we may be
partakers of His holiness.
11 Now no chastening seems to be
joyful for the present, but painful;
nevertheless, a erward it yields the
peaceable fruit of righteousness to those
who have been trained by it.
12 Therefore strengthen the hands
which hang down, and the feeble knees,HEBREWS 12
46
13 and make straight paths for your
feet, so that what is lame may not be
dislocated, but rather be healed.
14 Pursue peace with all people, and
holiness, without which no one will see
the Lord:
15 looking carefully lest anyone fall
short of the grace of God; lest any root
of bi erness springing up cause trouble,
and by this many become deﬁled;
16 lest there be any fornicator or
profane person like Esau, who for one
morsel of food sold his birthright.
17 For you know that a erward, when
he wanted to inherit the blessing, he
was rejected, for he found no place
for repentance, though he sought it
diligently with tears.
18 For you have not come to the
mountain that may be touched and that
burned with ﬁre, and to blackness and
darkness and tempest,HEBREWS 12
47
19 and the sound of a trumpet and the
voice of words, so that those who heard
it begged that the word should not be
spoken to them anymore.
20 (For they could not endure what was
commanded: "And if so much as a beast
touches the mountain, it shall be stoned
or shot with an arrow."
21 And so terrifying was the sight that
Moses said, "I am exceedingly afraid and
trembling.")
22 But you have come to Mount Zion
and to the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable
company of angels,
23 to the general assembly and church
of the ﬁrstborn who are registered in
heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the
spirits of just men made perfect,
24 to Jesus the Mediator of the new
covenant, and to the blood of sprinklingHEBREWS 12
48
that speaks be er things than that of
Abel.
25 See that you do not refuse Him who
speaks. For if they did not escape who
refused Him who spoke on earth, much
more shall we not escape if we turn away
from Him who speaks from heaven,
26 whose voice then shook the earth;
but now He has promised, saying, "Yet
once more I shake not only the earth,
but also heaven."
27 Now this, "Yet once more," indicates
the removal of those things that are
being shaken, as of things that are made,
that the things which cannot be shaken
may remain.
28 Therefore, since we are receiving a
kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us
have grace, by which we may serve God
acceptably with reverence and godly
fear.
29 For our God is a consuming ﬁre.HEBREWS 13
1 Let brotherly love con
49
nue.
2 Do not forget to entertain
strangers, for by so doing some have
unwi ngly entertained angels.
3 Remember the prisoners as if chained
with them––those who are mistreated–
–since you yourselves are in the body
also.
4 Marriage is honorable among all, and
the bed undeﬁled; but fornicators and
adulterers God will judge.
5 Let your conduct be without
covetousness; be content with such
things as you have. For He Himself has
said, "I will never leave you nor forsake
you."
6 So we may boldly say: "The LORD is
my helper; I will not fear. What can man
do to me?"
7 Remember those who rule over you,
who have spoken the word of God to
13HEBREWS 13
50
you, whose faith follow, considering the
outcome of their conduct.
8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
today, and forever.
9 Do not be carried about with various
and strange doctrines. For it is good that
the heart be established by grace, not
with foods which have not proﬁted those
who have been occupied with them.
10 We have an altar from which those
who serve the tabernacle have no right
to eat.
11 For the bodies of those animals,
whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are
burned outside the camp.
12 Therefore Jesus also, that He might
sanc fy the people with His own blood,
suﬀered outside the gate.
13 Therefore let us go forth to Him,
outside the camp, bearing His reproach.HEBREWS 13
14 For here we have no con
51
nuing city,
but we seek the one to come.
15 Therefore by Him let us con nually
oﬀer the sacriﬁce of praise to God, that
is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to
His name.
16 But do not forget to do good and to
share, for with such sacriﬁces God is well
pleased.
17 Obey those who rule over you, and
be submissive, for they watch out for
your souls, as those who must give
account. Let them do so with joy and not
with grief, for that would be unproﬁtable
for you.
18 Pray for us; for we are conﬁdent that
we have a good conscience, in all things
desiring to live honorably.
19 But I especially urge you to do this,
that I may be restored to you the sooner.
20 Now may the God of peace who
brought up our Lord Jesus from theHEBREWS 13
52
dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlas ng
covenant,
21 make you complete in every good
work to do His will, working in you what
is well pleasing in His sight, through
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever
and ever. Amen.
22 And I appeal to you, brethren, bear
with the word of exhorta on, for I have
wri en to you in few words.
23 Know that our brother Timothy has
been set free, with whom I shall see you
if he comes shortly.
24 Greet all those who rule over you,
and all the saints. Those from Italy greet
you.
25 Grace be with you all. Amen.James
1
1 James, a bondservant of God and of
the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve
tribes which are sca ered abroad:
Gree ngs.
2 My brethren, count it all joy when you
fall into various trials,
3 knowing that the tes ng of your faith
produces pa ence.
4 But let pa ence have its perfect work,
that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking nothing.
5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him
ask of God, who gives to all liberally and
without reproach, and it will be given to
him.
6 But let him ask in faith, with no
doub ng, for he who doubts is like aJAMES 1
2
wave of the sea driven and tossed by the
wind.
7 For let not that man suppose that he
will receive anything from the Lord;
8 he is a double–minded man, unstable
in all his ways.
9 Let the lowly brother glory in his
exalta on,
10 but the rich in his humilia on,
because as a ﬂower of the ﬁeld he will
pass away.
11 For no sooner has the sun risen
with a burning heat than it withers the
grass; its ﬂower falls, and its beau ful
appearance perishes. So the rich man
also will fade away in his pursuits.
12 Blessed is the man who endures
tempta on; for when he has been
approved, he will receive the crown
of life which the Lord has promised to
those who love Him.JAMES 1
3
13 Let no one say when he is tempted,
"I am tempted by God"; for God cannot
be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself
tempt anyone.
14 But each one is tempted when he
is drawn away by his own desires and
en ced.
15 Then, when desire has conceived,
it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is
full–grown, brings forth death.
16 Do not be deceived, my beloved
brethren.
17 Every good gi and every perfect gi
is from above, and comes down from
the Father of lights, with whom there is
no varia on or shadow of turning.
18 Of His own will He brought us forth
by the word of truth, that we might be a
kind of ﬁrs ruits of His creatures.
19 So then, my beloved brethren, let
every man be swi to hear, slow to
speak, slow to wrath;JAMES 1
4
20 for the wrath of man does not
produce the righteousness of God.
21 Therefore lay aside all ﬁlthiness and
overﬂow of wickedness, and receive
with meekness the implanted word,
which is able to save your souls.
22 But be doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word
and not a doer, he is like a man observing
his natural face in a mirror;
24 for he observes himself, goes away,
and immediately forgets what kind of
man he was.
25 But he who looks into the perfect law
of liberty and con nues in it, and is not a
forge ul hearer but a doer of the work,
this one will be blessed in what he does.
26 If anyone among you thinks he is
religious, and does not bridle his tongue
but deceives his own heart, this one’s
religion is useless.JAMES 1 – 2
5
27 Pure and undeﬁled religion before
God and the Father is this: to visit
orphans and widows in their trouble,
and to keep oneself unspo ed from the
world.
1 My brethren, do not hold the faith
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
glory, with par ality.
2 For if there should come into your
assembly a man with gold rings, in ﬁne
apparel, and there should also come in a
poor man in ﬁlthy clothes,
3 and you pay a en on to the one
wearing the ﬁne clothes and say to him,
"You sit here in a good place," and say to
the poor man, "You stand there," or, "Sit
here at my footstool,"
4 have you not shown par ality among
yourselves, and become judges with evil
thoughts?
5 Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God
not chosen the poor of this world to be
2JAMES 2
6
rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom
which He promised to those who love
Him?
6 But you have dishonored the poor
man. Do not the rich oppress you and
drag you into the courts?
7 Do they not blaspheme that noble
name by which you are called?
8 If you really fulﬁll the royal law
according to the Scripture, "You shall
love your neighbor as yourself," you do
well;
9 but if you show par ality, you commit
sin, and are convicted by the law as
transgressors.
10 For whoever shall keep the whole
law, and yet stumble in one point, he is
guilty of all.
11 For He who said, "Do not commit
adultery," also said, "Do not murder."
Now if you do not commit adultery,JAMES 2
7
but you do murder, you have become a
transgressor of the law.
12 So speak and so do as those who will
be judged by the law of liberty.
13 For judgment is without mercy to the
one who has shown no mercy. Mercy
triumphs over judgment.
14 What does it proﬁt, my brethren, if
someone says he has faith but does not
have works? Can faith save him?
15 If a brother or sister is naked and
des tute of daily food,
16 and one of you says to them, "Depart
in peace, be warmed and ﬁlled," but you
do not give them the things which are
needed for the body, what does it proﬁt?
17 Thus also faith by itself, if it does not
have works, is dead.
18 But someone will say, "You have
faith, and I have works." Show me your
faith without your works, and I will show
you my faith by my works.JAMES 2
8
19 You believe that there is one God. You
do well. Even the demons believe––and
tremble!
20 But do you want to know, O foolish
man, that faith without works is dead?
21 Was not Abraham our father jus ﬁed
by works when he oﬀered Isaac his son
on the altar?
22 Do you see that faith was working
together with his works, and by works
faith was made perfect?
23 And the Scripture was fulﬁlled which
says, "Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for righteousness."
And he was called the friend of God.
24 You see then that a man is jus ﬁed
by works, and not by faith only.
25 Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot
also jus ﬁed by works when she
received the messengers and sent them
out another way?JAMES 2 – 3
9
26 For as the body without the spirit
is dead, so faith without works is dead
also.
1 My brethren, let not many of you
become teachers, knowing that we
shall receive a stricter judgment.
2 For we all stumble in many things. If
anyone does not stumble in word, he
is a perfect man, able also to bridle the
whole body.
3 Indeed, we put bits in horses’ mouths
that they may obey us, and we turn their
whole body.
4 Look also at ships: although they are
so large and are driven by ﬁerce winds,
they are turned by a very small rudder
wherever the pilot desires.
5 Even so the tongue is a li le member
and boasts great things. See how great a
forest a li le ﬁre kindles!
6 And the tongue is a ﬁre, a world of
iniquity. The tongue is so set among our
3JAMES 3
10
members that it deﬁles the whole body,
and sets on ﬁre the course of nature;
and it is set on ﬁre by hell.
7 For every kind of beast and bird, of
rep le and creature of the sea, is tamed
and has been tamed by mankind.
8 But no man can tame the tongue. It is
an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
9 With it we bless our God and Father,
and with it we curse men, who have
been made in the similitude of God.
10 Out of the same mouth proceed
blessing and cursing. My brethren, these
things ought not to be so.
11 Does a spring send forth fresh water
and bi er from the same opening?
12 Can a ﬁg tree, my brethren, bear
olives, or a grapevine bear ﬁgs? Thus no
spring yields both salt water and fresh.
13 Who is wise and understanding
among you? Let him show by goodJAMES 3 – 4
11
conduct that his works are done in the
meekness of wisdom.
14 But if you have bi er envy and
self–seeking in your hearts, do not boast
and lie against the truth.
15 This wisdom does not descend from
above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.
16 For where envy and self–seeking
exist, confusion and every evil thing are
there.
17 But the wisdom that is from above is
ﬁrst pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing
to yield, full of mercy and good fruits,
without par ality and without hypocrisy.
18 Now the fruit of righteousness is
sown in peace by those who make
peace.
1 Where do wars and ﬁghts come
from among you? Do they not come
from your desires for pleasure that war
in your members?
4JAMES 4
12
2 You lust and do not have. You murder
and covet and cannot obtain. You ﬁght
and war. Yet you do not have because
you do not ask.
3 You ask and do not receive, because
you ask amiss, that you may spend it on
your pleasures.
4 Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you
not know that friendship with the world
is enmity with God? Whoever therefore
wants to be a friend of the world makes
himself an enemy of God.
5 Or do you think that the Scripture
says in vain, "The Spirit who dwells in us
yearns jealously"?
6 But He gives more grace. Therefore He
says: "God resists the proud, But gives
grace to the humble."
7 Therefore submit to God. Resist the
devil and he will ﬂee from you.
8 Draw near to God and He will draw
near to you. Cleanse your hands, youJAMES 4
13
sinners; and purify your hearts, you
double–minded.
9 Lament and mourn and weep! Let
your laughter be turned to mourning
and your joy to gloom.
10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the
Lord, and He will li you up.
11 Do not speak evil of one another,
brethren. He who speaks evil of a
brother and judges his brother, speaks
evil of the law and judges the law. But if
you judge the law, you are not a doer of
the law but a judge.
12 There is one Lawgiver, who is able
to save and to destroy. Who are you to
judge another?
13 Come now, you who say, "Today or
tomorrow we will go to such and such
a city, spend a year there, buy and sell,
and make a proﬁt";
14 whereas you do not know what will
happen tomorrow. For what is your life?JAMES 4 – 5
14
It is even a vapor that appears for a li le
me and then vanishes away.
15 Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord
wills, we shall live and do this or that."
16 But now you boast in your arrogance.
All such boas ng is evil.
17 Therefore, to him who knows to do
good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
1 Come now, you rich, weep and
howl for your miseries that are
coming upon you!
2 Your riches are corrupted, and your
garments are moth–eaten.
3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and
their corrosion will be a witness against
you and will eat your ﬂesh like ﬁre. You
have heaped up treasure in the last days.
4 Indeed the wages of the laborers who
mowed your ﬁelds, which you kept back
by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the
reapers have reached the ears of the
Lord of Sabaoth.
5JAMES 5
15
5 You have lived on the earth in pleasure
and luxury; you have fa ened your
hearts as in a day of slaughter.
6 You have condemned, you have
murdered the just; he does not resist
you.
7 Therefore be pa ent, brethren, un l
the coming of the Lord. See how the
farmer waits for the precious fruit of
the earth, wai ng pa ently for it un l it
receives the early and la er rain.
8 You also be pa ent. Establish your
hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at
hand.
9 Do not grumble against one another,
brethren, lest you be condemned.
Behold, the Judge is standing at the
door!
10 My brethren, take the prophets, who
spoke in the name of the Lord, as an
example of suﬀering and pa ence.JAMES 5
16
11 Indeed we count them blessed
who endure. You have heard of the
perseverance of Job and seen the end
intended by the Lord––that the Lord is
very compassionate and merciful.
12 But above all, my brethren, do not
swear, either by heaven or by earth or
with any other oath. But let your "Yes,"
be "Yes," and your "No," "No," lest you
fall into judgment.
13 Is anyone among you suﬀering? Let
him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him
sing psalms.
14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him
call for the elders of the church, and let
them pray over him, anoin ng him with
oil in the name of the Lord.
15 And the prayer of faith will save the
sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And
if he has commi ed sins, he will be
forgiven.JAMES 5
17
16 Confess your trespasses to one
another, and pray for one another,
that you may be healed. The eﬀec ve,
fervent prayer of a righteous man avails
much.
17 Elijah was a man with a nature like
ours, and he prayed earnestly that it
would not rain; and it did not rain on the
land for three years and six months.
18 And he prayed again, and the heaven
gave rain, and the earth produced its
fruit.
19 Brethren, if anyone among you
wanders from the truth, and someone
turns him back,
20 let him know that he who turns a
sinner from the error of his way will save
a soul from death and cover a mul tude
of sins.1 Peter
1
1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
To the pilgrims of the Dispersion in
Pontus, Gala a, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia,
2 elect according to the foreknowledge
of God the Father, in sanc ﬁca on of the
Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of
the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you
and peace be mul plied.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His
abundant mercy has bego en us again
to a living hope through the resurrec on
of Jesus Christ from the dead,
4 to an inheritance incorrup ble and
undeﬁled and that does not fade away,
reserved in heaven for you,1 PETER 1
2
5 who are kept by the power of God
through faith for salva on ready to be
revealed in the last me.
6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now
for a li le while, if need be, you have
been grieved by various trials,
7 that the genuineness of your faith,
being much more precious than gold
that perishes, though it is tested by ﬁre,
may be found to praise, honor, and glory
at the revela on of Jesus Christ,
8 whom having not seen you love.
Though now you do not see Him,
yet believing, you rejoice with joy
inexpressible and full of glory,
9 receiving the end of your faith––the
salva on of your souls.
10 Of this salva on the prophets have
inquired and searched carefully, who
prophesied of the grace that would
come to you,1 PETER 1
3
11 searching what, or what manner of
me, the Spirit of Christ who was in
them was indica ng when He tes ﬁed
beforehand the suﬀerings of Christ and
the glories that would follow.
12 To them it was revealed that, not
to themselves, but to us they were
ministering the things which now have
been reported to you through those who
have preached the gospel to you by the
Holy Spirit sent from heaven––things
which angels desire to look into.
13 Therefore gird up the loins of your
mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully
upon the grace that is to be brought to
you at the revela on of Jesus Christ;
14 as obedient children, not conforming
yourselves to the former lusts, as in your
ignorance;
15 but as He who called you is holy, you
also be holy in all your conduct,1 PETER 1
16 because it is wri
4
en, "Be holy, for I
am holy."
17 And if you call on the Father, who
without par ality judges according to
each one’s work, conduct yourselves
throughout the me of your stay here in
fear;
18 knowing that you were not redeemed
with corrup ble things, like silver or
gold, from your aimless conduct received
by tradi on from your fathers,
19 but with the precious blood of
Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
without spot.
20 He indeed was foreordained before
the founda on of the world, but was
manifest in these last mes for you
21 who through Him believe in God,
who raised Him from the dead and gave
Him glory, so that your faith and hope
are in God.1 PETER 1 – 2
5
22 Since you have puriﬁed your souls in
obeying the truth through the Spirit in
sincere love of the brethren, love one
another fervently with a pure heart,
23 having been born again, not of
corrup ble seed but incorrup ble,
through the word of God which lives and
abides forever,
24 because "All ﬂesh is as grass, And all
the glory of man as the ﬂower of the
grass. The grass withers, And its ﬂower
falls away,
25 But the word of the LORD endures
forever." Now this is the word which by
the gospel was preached to you.
1 Therefore, laying aside all malice,
all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil
speaking,
2 as newborn babes, desire the pure
milk of the word, that you may grow
thereby,
21 PETER 2
6
3 if indeed you have tasted that the
Lord is gracious.
4 Coming to Him as to a living stone,
rejected indeed by men, but chosen by
God and precious,
5 you also, as living stones, are being
built up a spiritual house, a holy
priesthood, to oﬀer up spiritual sacriﬁces
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
6 Therefore it is also contained in the
Scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion A chief
cornerstone, elect, precious, And he
who believes on Him will by no means
be put to shame."
7 Therefore, to you who believe, He
is precious; but to those who are
disobedient, "The stone which the
builders rejected Has become the chief
cornerstone,"
8 and "A stone of stumbling And a
rock of oﬀense." They stumble, being1 PETER 2
7
disobedient to the word, to which they
also were appointed.
9 But you are a chosen genera on, a
royal priesthood, a holy na on, His own
special people, that you may proclaim
the praises of Him who called you out of
darkness into His marvelous light;
10 who once were not a people but are
now the people of God, who had not
obtained mercy but now have obtained
mercy.
11 Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and
pilgrims, abstain from ﬂeshly lusts which
war against the soul,
12 having your conduct honorable
among the Gen les, that when they
speak against you as evildoers, they may,
by your good works which they observe,
glorify God in the day of visita on.
13 Therefore submit yourselves to every
ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake,
whether to the king as supreme,1 PETER 2
8
14 or to governors, as to those who
are sent by him for the punishment of
evildoers and for the praise of those who
do good.
15 For this is the will of God, that by
doing good you may put to silence the
ignorance of foolish men––
16 as free, yet not using liberty as a
cloak for vice, but as bondservants of
God.
17 Honor all people. Love the
brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
18 Servants, be submissive to your
masters with all fear, not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the harsh.
19 For this is commendable, if because
of conscience toward God one endures
grief, suﬀering wrongfully.
20 For what credit is it if, when you
are beaten for your faults, you take it
pa ently? But when you do good and1 PETER 2 – 3
9
suﬀer, if you take it pa ently, this is
commendable before God.
21 For to this you were called, because
Christ also suﬀered for us, leaving us
an example, that you should follow His
steps:
22 "Who commi ed no sin, Nor was
deceit found in His mouth";
23 who, when He was reviled, did not
revile in return; when He suﬀered, He
did not threaten, but commi ed Himself
to Him who judges righteously;
24 who Himself bore our sins in His own
body on the tree, that we, having died
to sins, might live for righteousness––by
whose stripes you were healed.
25 For you were like sheep going astray,
but have now returned to the Shepherd
and Overseer of your souls.
1 Wives, likewise, be submissive
to your own husbands, that even
if some do not obey the word, they,
31 PETER 3
10
without a word, may be won by the
conduct of their wives,
2 when they observe your chaste
conduct accompanied by fear.
3 Do not let your adornment be merely
outward––arranging the hair, wearing
gold, or pu ng on ﬁne apparel––
4 rather let it be the hidden person of
the heart, with the incorrup ble beauty
of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very
precious in the sight of God.
5 For in this manner, in former mes,
the holy women who trusted in God also
adorned themselves, being submissive
to their own husbands,
6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him
lord, whose daughters you are if you do
good and are not afraid with any terror.
7 Husbands, likewise, dwell with them
with understanding, giving honor to the
wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as1 PETER 3
11
being heirs together of the grace of life,
that your prayers may not be hindered.
8 Finally, all of you be of one mind,
having compassion for one another;
love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be
courteous;
9 not returning evil for evil or reviling
for reviling, but on the contrary blessing,
knowing that you were called to this,
that you may inherit a blessing.
10 For "He who would love life And see
good days, Let him refrain his tongue
from evil, And his lips from speaking
deceit.
11 Let him turn away from evil and do
good; Let him seek peace and pursue it.
12 For the eyes of the LORD are on the
righteous, And His ears are open to their
prayers; But the face of the LORD is
against those who do evil."
13 And who is he who will harm you if
you become followers of what is good?1 PETER 3
12
14 But even if you should suﬀer for
righteousness’ sake, you are blessed.
"And do not be afraid of their threats,
nor be troubled."
15 But sanc fy the Lord God in your
hearts, and always be ready to give a
defense to everyone who asks you a
reason for the hope that is in you, with
meekness and fear;
16 having a good conscience, that when
they defame you as evildoers, those who
revile your good conduct in Christ may
be ashamed.
17 For it is be er, if it is the will of God,
to suﬀer for doing good than for doing
evil.
18 For Christ also suﬀered once for sins,
the just for the unjust, that He might
bring us to God, being put to death in
the ﬂesh but made alive by the Spirit,
19 by whom also He went and preached
to the spirits in prison,1 PETER 3 – 4
13
20 who formerly were disobedient,
when once the Divine longsuﬀering
waited in the days of Noah, while the
ark was being prepared, in which a few,
that is, eight souls, were saved through
water.
21 There is also an an type which now
saves us––bap sm (not the removal of
the ﬁlth of the ﬂesh, but the answer of a
good conscience toward God), through
the resurrec on of Jesus Christ,
22 who has gone into heaven and is
at the right hand of God, angels and
authori es and powers having been
made subject to Him.
1 Therefore, since Christ suﬀered for
us in the ﬂesh, arm yourselves also
with the same mind, for he who has
suﬀered in the ﬂesh has ceased from sin,
2 that he no longer should live the rest
of his me in the ﬂesh for the lusts of
men, but for the will of God.
41 PETER 4
14
3 For we have spent enough of our
past life me in doing the will of the
Gen les––when we walked in lewdness,
lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking
par es, and abominable idolatries.
4 In regard to these, they think it
strange that you do not run with them in
the same ﬂood of dissipa on, speaking
evil of you.
5 They will give an account to Him who
is ready to judge the living and the dead.
6 For this reason the gospel was
preached also to those who are dead,
that they might be judged according to
men in the ﬂesh, but live according to
God in the spirit.
7 But the end of all things is at hand;
therefore be serious and watchful in
your prayers.
8 And above all things have fervent love
for one another, for "love will cover a
mul tude of sins."1 PETER 4
15
9 Be hospitable to one another without
grumbling.
10 As each one has received a gi ,
minister it to one another, as good
stewards of the manifold grace of God.
11 If anyone speaks, let him speak as the
oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let
him do it as with the ability which God
supplies, that in all things God may be
gloriﬁed through Jesus Christ, to whom
belong the glory and the dominion
forever and ever. Amen.
12 Beloved, do not think it strange
concerning the ﬁery trial which is to
try you, as though some strange thing
happened to you;
13 but rejoice to the extent that you
partake of Christ’s suﬀerings, that when
His glory is revealed, you may also be
glad with exceeding joy.
14 If you are reproached for the name
of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit1 PETER 4
16
of glory and of God rests upon you. On
their part He is blasphemed, but on your
part He is gloriﬁed.
15 But let none of you suﬀer as a
murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a
busybody in other people’s ma ers.
16 Yet if anyone suﬀers as a Chris an, let
him not be ashamed, but let him glorify
God in this ma er.
17 For the me has come for judgment
to begin at the house of God; and if it
begins with us ﬁrst, what will be the end
of those who do not obey the gospel of
God?
18 Now "If the righteous one is scarcely
saved, Where will the ungodly and the
sinner appear?"
19 Therefore let those who suﬀer
according to the will of God commit
their souls to Him in doing good, as to a
faithful Creator.1 PETER 5
5
17
1 The elders who are among you I
exhort, I who am a fellow elder and
a witness of the suﬀerings of Christ, and
also a partaker of the glory that will be
revealed:
2 Shepherd the ﬂock of God which is
among you, serving as overseers, not
by compulsion but willingly, not for
dishonest gain but eagerly;
3 nor as being lords over those
entrusted to you, but being examples to
the ﬂock;
4 and when the Chief Shepherd appears,
you will receive the crown of glory that
does not fade away.
5 Likewise you younger people, submit
yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of
you be submissive to one another,
and be clothed with humility, for "God
resists the proud, But gives grace to the
humble."1 PETER 5
18
6 Therefore humble yourselves under
the mighty hand of God, that He may
exalt you in due me,
7 cas ng all your care upon Him, for He
cares for you.
8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your
adversary the devil walks about like
a roaring lion, seeking whom he may
devour.
9 Resist him, steadfast in the faith,
knowing that the same suﬀerings are
experienced by your brotherhood in the
world.
10 But may the God of all grace, who
called us to His eternal glory by Christ
Jesus, a er you have suﬀered a while,
perfect, establish, strengthen, and se le
you.
11 To Him be the glory and the dominion
forever and ever. Amen.
12 By Silvanus, our faithful brother as
I consider him, I have wri en to you1 PETER 5
19
brieﬂy, exhor ng and tes fying that this
is the true grace of God in which you
stand.
13 She who is in Babylon, elect together
with you, greets you; and so does Mark
my son.
14 Greet one another with a kiss of love.
Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus.
Amen.2 Peter
1
1 Simon Peter, a bondservant and
apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who
have obtained like precious faith with
us by the righteousness of our God and
Savior Jesus Christ:
2 Grace and peace be mul plied to you
in the knowledge of God and of Jesus
our Lord,
3 as His divine power has given to us all
things that pertain to life and godliness,
through the knowledge of Him who
called us by glory and virtue,
4 by which have been given to
us exceedingly great and precious
promises, that through these you may
be partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corrup on that is in the
world through lust.2 PETER 1
2
5 But also for this very reason, giving
all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to
virtue knowledge,
6 to knowledge self–control, to self–
control perseverance, to perseverance
godliness,
7 to godliness brotherly kindness, and
to brotherly kindness love.
8 For if these things are yours and
abound, you will be neither barren nor
unfrui ul in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
9 For he who lacks these things is
shortsighted, even to blindness, and has
forgo en that he was cleansed from his
old sins.
10 Therefore, brethren, be even more
diligent to make your call and elec on
sure, for if you do these things you will
never stumble;
11 for so an entrance will be supplied
to you abundantly into the everlas ng2 PETER 1
3
kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.
12 For this reason I will not be negligent
to remind you always of these things,
though you know and are established in
the present truth.
13 Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am
in this tent, to s r you up by reminding
you,
14 knowing that shortly I must put oﬀ
my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ
showed me.
15 Moreover I will be careful to ensure
that you always have a reminder of these
things a er my decease.
16 For we did not follow cunningly
devised fables when we made known to
you the power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of
His majesty.
17 For He received from God the Father
honor and glory when such a voice came2 PETER 1 – 2
4
to Him from the Excellent Glory: "This
is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased."
18 And we heard this voice which came
from heaven when we were with Him on
the holy mountain.
19 And so we have the prophe c word
conﬁrmed, which you do well to heed as
a light that shines in a dark place, un l
the day dawns and the morning star
rises in your hearts;
20 knowing this ﬁrst, that no prophecy of
Scripture is of any private interpreta on,
21 for prophecy never came by the will
of man, but holy men of God spoke as
they were moved by the Holy Spirit.
1 But there were also false prophets
among the people, even as there will
be false teachers among you, who will
secretly bring in destruc ve heresies,
even denying the Lord who bought
22 PETER 2
5
them, and bring on themselves swi
destruc on.
2 And many will follow their destruc ve
ways, because of whom the way of truth
will be blasphemed.
3 By covetousness they will exploit you
with decep ve words; for a long me
their judgment has not been idle, and
their destruc on does not slumber.
4 For if God did not spare the angels
who sinned, but cast them down to
hell and delivered them into chains of
darkness, to be reserved for judgment;
5 and did not spare the ancient world,
but saved Noah, one of eight people, a
preacher of righteousness, bringing in
the ﬂood on the world of the ungodly;
6 and turning the ci es of Sodom and
Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them
to destruc on, making them an example
to those who a erward would live
ungodly;2 PETER 2
6
7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was
oppressed by the ﬁlthy conduct of the
wicked
8 (for that righteous man, dwelling
among them, tormented his righteous
soul from day to day by seeing and
hearing their lawless deeds) ––
9 then the Lord knows how to deliver
the godly out of tempta ons and to
reserve the unjust under punishment for
the day of judgment,
10 and especially those who walk
according to the ﬂesh in the lust of
uncleanness and despise authority. They
are presumptuous, self–willed. They are
not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries,
11 whereas angels, who are greater in
power and might, do not bring a reviling
accusa on against them before the Lord.
12 But these, like natural brute beasts
made to be caught and destroyed,
speak evil of the things they do not2 PETER 2
7
understand, and will u erly perish in
their own corrup on,
13 and will receive the wages of
unrighteousness, as those who count it
pleasure to carouse in the day me. They
are spots and blemishes, carousing in
their own decep ons while they feast
with you,
14 having eyes full of adultery and that
cannot cease from sin, en cing unstable
souls. They have a heart trained in
covetous prac ces, and are accursed
children.
15 They have forsaken the right way and
gone astray, following the way of Balaam
the son of Beor, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness;
16 but he was rebuked for his iniquity:
a dumb donkey speaking with a man’s
voice restrained the madness of the
prophet.2 PETER 2

17 These are wells without water,
clouds carried by a tempest, for whom
is reserved the blackness of darkness
forever.
18 For when they speak great swelling
words of emp ness, they allure through
the lusts of the ﬂesh, through lewdness,
the ones who have actually escaped
from those who live in error.
19 While they promise them liberty,
they themselves are slaves of corrup on;
for by whom a person is overcome, by
him also he is brought into bondage.
20 For if, a er they have escaped the
pollu ons of the world through the
knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, they are again entangled in them
and overcome, the la er end is worse
for them than the beginning.
21 For it would have been be er for
them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than having known it,2 PETER 2 – 3
9
to turn from the holy commandment
delivered to them.
22 But it has happened to them
according to the true proverb: "A dog
returns to his own vomit," and, "a sow,
having washed, to her wallowing in the
mire."
1 Beloved, I now write to you this
second epistle (in both of which I s r
up your pure minds by way of reminder),
2 that you may be mindful of the words
which were spoken before by the holy
prophets, and of the commandment of
us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior,
3 knowing this ﬁrst: that scoﬀers will
come in the last days, walking according
to their own lusts,
4 and saying, "Where is the promise of
His coming? For since the fathers fell
asleep, all things con nue as they were
from the beginning of crea on."
32 PETER 3
10
5 For this they willfully forget: that by
the word of God the heavens were of
old, and the earth standing out of water
and in the water,
6 by which the world that then existed
perished, being ﬂooded with water.
7 But the heavens and the earth which
are now preserved by the same word,
are reserved for ﬁre un l the day of
judgment and perdi on of ungodly men.
8 But, beloved, do not forget this one
thing, that with the Lord one day is as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as
one day.
9 The Lord is not slack concerning His
promise, as some count slackness, but is
longsuﬀering toward us, not willing that
any should perish but that all should
come to repentance.
10 But the day of the Lord will come as
a thief in the night, in which the heavens
will pass away with a great noise, and2 PETER 3
11
the elements will melt with fervent heat;
both the earth and the works that are in
it will be burned up.
11 Therefore, since all these things will
be dissolved, what manner of persons
ought you to be in holy conduct and
godliness,
12 looking for and hastening the coming
of the day of God, because of which the
heavens will be dissolved, being on ﬁre,
and the elements will melt with fervent
heat?
13 Nevertheless we, according to His
promise, look for new heavens and
a new earth in which righteousness
dwells.
14 Therefore, beloved, looking forward
to these things, be diligent to be found
by Him in peace, without spot and
blameless;
15 and consider that the longsuﬀering
of our Lord is salva on––as also our2 PETER 3
12
beloved brother Paul, according to the
wisdom given to him, has wri en to you,
16 as also in all his epistles, speaking
in them of these things, in which are
some things hard to understand, which
untaught and unstable people twist to
their own destruc on, as they do also
the rest of the Scriptures.
17 You therefore, beloved, since you
know this beforehand, beware lest you
also fall from your own steadfastness,
being led away with the error of the
wicked;
18 but grow in the grace and knowledge
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
Him be the glory both now and forever.
Amen.1 John

1 That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard, which we
have seen with our eyes, which we
have looked upon, and our hands have
handled, concerning the Word of life––
2 the life was manifested, and we have
seen, and bear witness, and declare to
you that eternal life which was with the
Father and was manifested to us––
3 that which we have seen and heard
we declare to you, that you also may
have fellowship with us; and truly our
fellowship is with the Father and with
His Son Jesus Christ.
4 And these things we write to you that
your joy may be full.
5 This is the message which we have
heard from Him and declare to you, that1 JOHN 1 – 2
2
God is light and in Him is no darkness at
all.
6 If we say that we have fellowship with
Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do
not prac ce the truth.
7 But if we walk in the light as He is in
the light, we have fellowship with one
another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
His Son cleanses us from all sin.
8 If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.
9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we say that we have not sinned, we
make Him a liar, and His word is not in
us.
1 My li le children, these things I
write to you, so that you may not
sin. And if anyone sins, we have an
21 JOHN 2
3
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous.
2 And He Himself is the propi a on for
our sins, and not for ours only but also
for the whole world.
3 Now by this we know that we know
Him, if we keep His commandments.
4 He who says, "I know Him," and does
not keep His commandments, is a liar,
and the truth is not in him.
5 But whoever keeps His word, truly the
love of God is perfected in him. By this
we know that we are in Him.
6 He who says he abides in Him ought
himself also to walk just as He walked.
7 Brethren, I write no new
commandment to you, but an old
commandment which you have
had from the beginning. The old
commandment is the word which you
heard from the beginning.1 JOHN 2
4
8 Again, a new commandment I write
to you, which thing is true in Him and
in you, because the darkness is passing
away, and the true light is already
shining.
9 He who says he is in the light, and
hates his brother, is in darkness un l
now.
10 He who loves his brother abides
in the light, and there is no cause for
stumbling in him.
11 But he who hates his brother is
in darkness and walks in darkness,
and does not know where he is going,
because the darkness has blinded his
eyes.
12 I write to you, li le children, Because
your sins are forgiven you for His name’s
sake.
13 I write to you, fathers, Because
you have known Him who is from the
beginning. I write to you, young men,1 JOHN 2
5
Because you have overcome the wicked
one. I write to you, li le children,
Because you have known the Father.
14 I have wri en to you, fathers,
Because you have known Him who is
from the beginning. I have wri en to
you, young men, Because you are strong,
and the word of God abides in you, And
you have overcome the wicked one.
15 Do not love the world or the things in
the world. If anyone loves the world, the
love of the Father is not in him.
16 For all that is in the world––the lust
of the ﬂesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life––is not of the Father but is
of the world.
17 And the world is passing away, and
the lust of it; but he who does the will of
God abides forever.
18 Li le children, it is the last hour; and
as you have heard that the An christ is
coming, even now many an christs have1 JOHN 2
6
come, by which we know that it is the
last hour.
19 They went out from us, but they
were not of us; for if they had been of
us, they would have con nued with us;
but they went out that they might be
made manifest, that none of them were
of us.
20 But you have an anoin ng from the
Holy One, and you know all things.
21 I have not wri en to you because you
do not know the truth, but because you
know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
22 Who is a liar but he who denies that
Jesus is the Christ? He is an christ who
denies the Father and the Son.
23 Whoever denies the Son does
not have the Father either; he who
acknowledges the Son has the Father
also.
24 Therefore let that abide in you which
you heard from the beginning. If what1 JOHN 2
7
you heard from the beginning abides in
you, you also will abide in the Son and in
the Father.
25 And this is the promise that He has
promised us––eternal life.
26 These things I have wri en to you
concerning those who try to deceive
you.
27 But the anoin ng which you have
received from Him abides in you, and
you do not need that anyone teach you;
but as the same anoin ng teaches you
concerning all things, and is true, and is
not a lie, and just as it has taught you,
you will abide in Him.
28 And now, li le children, abide in Him,
that when He appears, we may have
conﬁdence and not be ashamed before
Him at His coming.
29 If you know that He is righteous,
you know that everyone who prac ces
righteousness is born of Him.1 JOHN 3
3
8
1 Behold what manner of love the
Father has bestowed on us, that
we should be called children of God!
Therefore the world does not know us,
because it did not know Him.
2 Beloved, now we are children of God;
and it has not yet been revealed what
we shall be, but we know that when He
is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we
shall see Him as He is.
3 And everyone who has this hope in
Him puriﬁes himself, just as He is pure.
4 Whoever commits sin also commits
lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
5 And you know that He was manifested
to take away our sins, and in Him there
is no sin.
6 Whoever abides in Him does not sin.
Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor
known Him.1 JOHN 3
7 Li
9
le children, let no one deceive
you. He who prac ces righteousness is
righteous, just as He is righteous.
8 He who sins is of the devil, for the
devil has sinned from the beginning.
For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested, that He might destroy the
works of the devil.
9 Whoever has been born of God does
not sin, for His seed remains in him; and
he cannot sin, because he has been born
of God.
10 In this the children of God
and the children of the devil are
manifest: Whoever does not prac ce
righteousness is not of God, nor is he
who does not love his brother.
11 For this is the message that you
heard from the beginning, that we
should love one another,
12 not as Cain who was of the wicked
one and murdered his brother. And why1 JOHN 3
10
did he murder him? Because his works
were evil and his brother’s righteous.
13 Do not marvel, my brethren, if the
world hates you.
14 We know that we have passed from
death to life, because we love the
brethren. He who does not love his
brother abides in death.
15 Whoever hates his brother is a
murderer, and you know that no
murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
16 By this we know love, because He laid
down His life for us. And we also ought
to lay down our lives for the brethren.
17 But whoever has this world’s goods,
and sees his brother in need, and shuts
up his heart from him, how does the
love of God abide in him?
18 My li le children, let us not love in
word or in tongue, but in deed and in
truth.1 JOHN 3
11
19 And by this we know that we are of
the truth, and shall assure our hearts
before Him.
20 For if our heart condemns us, God is
greater than our heart, and knows all
things.
21 Beloved, if our heart does not
condemn us, we have conﬁdence toward
God.
22 And whatever we ask we receive
from Him, because we keep His
commandments and do those things
that are pleasing in His sight.
23 And this is His commandment: that
we should believe on the name of His
Son Jesus Christ and love one another,
as He gave us commandment.
24 Now he who keeps His
commandments abides in Him,
and He in him. And by this we know that
He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He
has given us.1 JOHN 4
4
12
1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit,
but test the spirits, whether they are
of God; because many false prophets
have gone out into the world.
2 By this you know the Spirit of God:
Every spirit that confesses that Jesus
Christ has come in the ﬂesh is of God,
3 and every spirit that does not confess
that Jesus Christ has come in the ﬂesh is
not of God. And this is the spirit of the
An christ, which you have heard was
coming, and is now already in the world.
4 You are of God, li le children, and
have overcome them, because He who
is in you is greater than he who is in the
world.
5 They are of the world. Therefore they
speak as of the world, and the world
hears them.
6 We are of God. He who knows God
hears us; he who is not of God does not1 JOHN 4
13
hear us. By this we know the spirit of
truth and the spirit of error.
7 Beloved, let us love one another, for
love is of God; and everyone who loves
is born of God and knows God.
8 He who does not love does not know
God, for God is love.
9 In this the love of God was manifested
toward us, that God has sent His only
bego en Son into the world, that we
might live through Him.
10 In this is love, not that we loved God,
but that He loved us and sent His Son to
be the propi a on for our sins.
11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also
ought to love one another.
12 No one has seen God at any me. If
we love one another, God abides in us,
and His love has been perfected in us.
13 By this we know that we abide in
Him, and He in us, because He has given
us of His Spirit.1 JOHN 4
14 And we have seen and tes
14
fy that
the Father has sent the Son as Savior of
the world.
15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the
Son of God, God abides in him, and he in
God.
16 And we have known and believed the
love that God has for us. God is love, and
he who abides in love abides in God, and
God in him.
17 Love has been perfected among us in
this: that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment; because as He is, so
are we in this world.
18 There is no fear in love; but perfect
love casts out fear, because fear involves
torment. But he who fears has not been
made perfect in love.
19 We love Him because He ﬁrst loved
us.
20 If someone says, "I love God," and
hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who1 JOHN 4 – 5
15
does not love his brother whom he has
seen, how can he love God whom he has
not seen?
21 And this commandment we have
from Him: that he who loves God must
love his brother also.
1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the
Christ is born of God, and everyone
who loves Him who begot also loves him
who is bego en of Him.
2 By this we know that we love the
children of God, when we love God and
keep His commandments.
3 For this is the love of God, that we
keep His commandments. And His
commandments are not burdensome.
4 For whatever is born of God
overcomes the world. And this is
the victory that has overcome the
world––our faith.
51 JOHN 5
16
5 Who is he who overcomes the world,
but he who believes that Jesus is the Son
of God?
6 This is He who came by water and
blood––Jesus Christ; not only by water,
but by water and blood. And it is the
Spirit who bears witness, because the
Spirit is truth.
7 For there are three that bear witness
in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the
Holy Spirit; and these three are one.
8 And there are three that bear witness
on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the
blood; and these three agree as one.
9 If we receive the witness of men, the
witness of God is greater; for this is the
witness of God which He has tes ﬁed of
His Son.
10 He who believes in the Son of God
has the witness in himself; he who
does not believe God has made Him a1 JOHN 5
17
liar, because he has not believed the
tes mony that God has given of His Son.
11 And this is the tes mony: that God
has given us eternal life, and this life is in
His Son.
12 He who has the Son has life; he who
does not have the Son of God does not
have life.
13 These things I have wri en to you
who believe in the name of the Son of
God, that you may know that you have
eternal life, and that you may con nue
to believe in the name of the Son of God.
14 Now this is the conﬁdence that we
have in Him, that if we ask anything
according to His will, He hears us.
15 And if we know that He hears us,
whatever we ask, we know that we have
the pe ons that we have asked of Him.
16 If anyone sees his brother sinning a
sin which does not lead to death, he will
ask, and He will give him life for those1 JOHN 5
18
who commit sin not leading to death.
There is sin leading to death. I do not say
that he should pray about that.
17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there
is sin not leading to death.
18 We know that whoever is born of
God does not sin; but he who has been
born of God keeps himself, and the
wicked one does not touch him.
19 We know that we are of God, and the
whole world lies under the sway of the
wicked one.
20 And we know that the Son of God has
come and has given us an understanding,
that we may know Him who is true; and
we are in Him who is true, in His Son
Jesus Christ. This is the true God and
eternal life.
21 Li le children, keep yourselves from
idols. Amen.2 John

1 THE ELDER, To the elect lady and
her children, whom I love in truth,
and not only I, but also all those who
have known the truth,
2 because of the truth which abides in
us and will be with us forever:
3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with
you from God the Father and from the
Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,
in truth and love.
4 I rejoiced greatly that I have found
some of your children walking in truth,
as we received commandment from the
Father.
5 And now I plead with you, lady, not as
though I wrote a new commandment to
you, but that which we have had from
the beginning: that we love one another.2 JOHN 1
2
6 This is love, that we walk according
to His commandments. This is the
commandment, that as you have heard
from the beginning, you should walk in
it.
7 For many deceivers have gone out
into the world who do not confess Jesus
Christ as coming in the ﬂesh. This is a
deceiver and an an christ.
8 Look to yourselves, that we do not
lose those things we worked for, but that
we may receive a full reward.
9 Whoever transgresses and does not
abide in the doctrine of Christ does not
have God. He who abides in the doctrine
of Christ has both the Father and the
Son.
10 If anyone comes to you and does not
bring this doctrine, do not receive him
into your house nor greet him;
11 for he who greets him shares in his
evil deeds.2 JOHN 1
3
12 Having many things to write to you,
I did not wish to do so with paper and
ink; but I hope to come to you and speak
face to face, that our joy may be full.
13 The children of your elect sister greet
you. Amen.3 John
1
1 THE ELDER, To the beloved Gaius,
whom I love in truth:
2 Beloved, I pray that you may prosper
in all things and be in health, just as your
soul prospers.
3 For I rejoiced greatly when brethren
came and tes ﬁed of the truth that is in
you, just as you walk in the truth.
4 I have no greater joy than to hear that
my children walk in truth.
5 Beloved, you do faithfully whatever
you do for the brethren and for
strangers,
6 who have borne witness of your love
before the church. If you send them
forward on their journey in a manner
worthy of God, you will do well,3 JOHN 1
2
7 because they went forth for His
name’s sake, taking nothing from the
Gen les.
8 We therefore ought to receive such,
that we may become fellow workers for
the truth.
9 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes,
who loves to have the preeminence
among them, does not receive us.
10 Therefore, if I come, I will call to
mind his deeds which he does, pra ng
against us with malicious words. And not
content with that, he himself does not
receive the brethren, and forbids those
who wish to, pu ng them out of the
church.
11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil,
but what is good. He who does good is
of God, but he who does evil has not
seen God.
12 Demetrius has a good tes mony
from all, and from the truth itself. And3 JOHN 1
3
we also bear witness, and you know that
our tes mony is true.
13 I had many things to write, but I do
not wish to write to you with pen and
ink;
14 but I hope to see you shortly, and we
shall speak face to face. Peace to you.
Our friends greet you. Greet the friends
by name.Jude

3 Beloved, while I was very diligent to
write to you concerning our common
salva on, I found it necessary to write to
you exhor ng you to contend earnestly
for the faith which was once for all
delivered to the saints.
4 For certain men have crept in
unno ced, who long ago were marked
out for this condemna on, ungodly
men, who turn the grace of our God into
lewdness and deny the only Lord God
and our Lord Jesus Christ.JUDE 1
2
5 But I want to remind you, though you
once knew this, that the Lord, having
saved the people out of the land of
Egypt, a erward destroyed those who
did not believe.
6 And the angels who did not keep
their proper domain, but le their own
abode, He has reserved in everlas ng
chains under darkness for the judgment
of the great day;
7 as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the
ci es around them in a similar manner to
these, having given themselves over to
sexual immorality and gone a er strange
ﬂesh, are set forth as an example,
suﬀering the vengeance of eternal ﬁre.
8 Likewise also these dreamers deﬁle
the ﬂesh, reject authority, and speak evil
of dignitaries.
9 Yet Michael the archangel, in
contending with the devil, when he
disputed about the body of Moses,JUDE 1
3
dared not bring against him a reviling
accusa on, but said, "The Lord rebuke
you!"
10 But these speak evil of whatever they
do not know; and whatever they know
naturally, like brute beasts, in these
things they corrupt themselves.
11 Woe to them! For they have gone in
the way of Cain, have run greedily in the
error of Balaam for proﬁt, and perished
in the rebellion of Korah.
12 These are spots in your love feasts,
while they feast with you without fear,
serving only themselves. They are clouds
without water, carried about by the
winds; late autumn trees without fruit,
twice dead, pulled up by the roots;
13 raging waves of the sea, foaming
up their own shame; wandering stars
for whom is reserved the blackness of
darkness forever.JUDE 1
4
14 Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam,
prophesied about these men also,
saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten
thousands of His saints,
15 "to execute judgment on all, to
convict all who are ungodly among them
of all their ungodly deeds which they
have commi ed in an ungodly way, and
of all the harsh things which ungodly
sinners have spoken against Him."
16 These are grumblers, complainers,
walking according to their own lusts;
and they mouth great swelling words,
ﬂa ering people to gain advantage.
17 But you, beloved, remember the
words which were spoken before by the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:
18 how they told you that there would
be mockers in the last me who would
walk according to their own ungodly
lusts.JUDE 1
5
19 These are sensual persons, who
cause divisions, not having the Spirit.
20 But you, beloved, building yourselves
up on your most holy faith, praying in
the Holy Spirit,
21 keep yourselves in the love of God,
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ unto eternal life.
22 And on some have compassion,
making a dis nc on;
23 but others save with fear, pulling
them out of the ﬁre, ha ng even the
garment deﬁled by the ﬂesh.
24 Now to Him who is able to keep you
from stumbling, And to present you
faultless Before the presence of His glory
with exceeding joy,
25 To God our Savior, Who alone is wise,
Be glory and majesty, Dominion and
power, Both now and forever. Amen.Revela on

"who is and who was and who is to

9 I, John, both your brother and
companion in the tribula on and
kingdom and pa ence of Jesus Christ,
was on the island that is called PatmosREVELATION 1
3
for the word of God and for the
tes mony of Jesus Christ.
10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day,
and I heard behind me a loud voice, as
of a trumpet,
11 saying, "I am the Alpha and the
Omega, the First and the Last," and,
"What you see, write in a book and
send it to the seven churches which
are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to
Pergamos, to Thya ra, to Sardis, to
Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
12 Then I turned to see the voice that
spoke with me. And having turned I saw
seven golden lampstands,
13 and in the midst of the seven
lampstands One like the Son of Man,
clothed with a garment down to the feet
and girded about the chest with a golden
band.REVELATION 1

14 His head and hair were white like
wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like

15 His feet were like ﬁne brass, as if
reﬁned in a furnace, and His voice as the
sound of many waters;
16 He had in His right hand seven
stars, out of His mouth went a sharp

was like the sun shining in its strength.

and behold, I am alive forevermore.
Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and

1 A er these things I looked, and
behold, a door standing open in
heaven. And the ﬁrst voice which I heard
was like a trumpet speaking with me,
saying, "Come up here, and I will show
you things which must take place a er
this."
2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and
behold, a throne set in heaven, and One
sat on the throne.
3 And He who sat there was like a jasper
and a sardius stone in appearance; and
there was a rainbow around the throne,
in appearance like an emerald.
4 Around the throne were twenty–four
thrones, and on the thrones I saw
4REVELATION 4
16
twenty–four elders si ng, clothed in
white robes; and they had crowns of
gold on their heads.
5 And from the throne proceeded
lightnings, thunderings, and voices.
Seven lamps of ﬁre were burning before
the throne, which are the seven Spirits
of God.
6 Before the throne there was a sea of
glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the
throne, and around the throne, were
four living creatures full of eyes in front
and in back.
7 The ﬁrst living creature was like a lion,
the second living creature like a calf, the
third living creature had a face like a
man, and the fourth living creature was
like a ﬂying eagle.
8 The four living creatures, each having
six wings, were full of eyes around and
within. And they do not rest day or
night, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, LordREVELATION 4 – 5
17
God Almighty, Who was and is and is to
come!"
9 Whenever the living creatures give
glory and honor and thanks to Him who
sits on the throne, who lives forever and
ever,
10 the twenty–four elders fall down
before Him who sits on the throne and
worship Him who lives forever and ever,
and cast their crowns before the throne,
saying:
11 "You are worthy, O Lord, To receive
glory and honor and power; For You
created all things, And by Your will they
exist and were created."
1 And I saw in the right hand of
Him who sat on the throne a scroll
wri en inside and on the back, sealed
with seven seals.
2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming
with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to
open the scroll and to loose its seals?"
5REVELATION 5
18
3 And no one in heaven or on the earth
or under the earth was able to open the
scroll, or to look at it.
4 So I wept much, because no one was
found worthy to open and read the
scroll, or to look at it.
5 But one of the elders said to me,
"Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the
tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has
prevailed to open the scroll and to loose
its seven seals."
6 And I looked, and behold, in the midst
of the throne and of the four living
creatures, and in the midst of the elders,
stood a Lamb as though it had been
slain, having seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God
sent out into all the earth.
7 Then He came and took the scroll out
of the right hand of Him who sat on the
throne.REVELATION 5
19
8 Now when He had taken the scroll, the
four living creatures and the twenty–four
elders fell down before the Lamb, each
having a harp, and golden bowls full of
incense, which are the prayers of the
saints.
9 And they sang a new song, saying:
"You are worthy to take the scroll, And
to open its seals; For You were slain,
And have redeemed us to God by Your
blood Out of every tribe and tongue and
people and na on,
10 And have made us kings and priests
to our God; And we shall reign on the
earth."
11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice
of many angels around the throne, the
living creatures, and the elders; and
the number of them was ten thousand
mes ten thousand, and thousands of
thousands,REVELATION 5 – 6
20
12 saying with a loud voice: "Worthy is
the Lamb who was slain To receive power
and riches and wisdom, And strength
and honor and glory and blessing!"
13 And every creature which is in heaven
and on the earth and under the earth
and such as are in the sea, and all that
are in them, I heard saying: "Blessing
and honor and glory and power Be to
Him who sits on the throne, And to the
Lamb, forever and ever!"
14 Then the four living creatures said,
"Amen!" And the twenty–four elders
fell down and worshiped Him who lives
forever and ever.
1 Now I saw when the Lamb opened
one of the seals; and I heard one of
the four living creatures saying with a
voice like thunder, "Come and see."
2 And I looked, and behold, a white
horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and
6REVELATION 6
21
a crown was given to him, and he went
out conquering and to conquer.
3 When He opened the second seal, I
heard the second living creature saying,
"Come and see."
4 Another horse, ﬁery red, went out.
And it was granted to the one who sat
on it to take peace from the earth, and
that people should kill one another; and
there was given to him a great sword.
5 When He opened the third seal,
I heard the third living creature say,
"Come and see." So I looked, and behold,
a black horse, and he who sat on it had a
pair of scales in his hand.
6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the
four living creatures saying, "A quart of
wheat for a denarius, and three quarts
of barley for a denarius; and do not harm
the oil and the wine."REVELATION 6
22
7 When He opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth living
creature saying, "Come and see."
8 So I looked, and behold, a pale horse.
And the name of him who sat on it was
Death, and Hades followed with him.
And power was given to them over a
fourth of the earth, to kill with sword,
with hunger, with death, and by the
beasts of the earth.
9 When He opened the ﬁ h seal, I saw
under the altar the souls of those who
had been slain for the word of God and
for the tes mony which they held.
10 And they cried with a loud voice,
saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true,
un l You judge and avenge our blood on
those who dwell on the earth?"
11 Then a white robe was given to each
of them; and it was said to them that
they should rest a li le while longer,
un l both the number of their fellowREVELATION 6
23
servants and their brethren, who would
be killed as they were, was completed.
12 I looked when He opened the sixth
seal, and behold, there was a great
earthquake; and the sun became black
as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
became like blood.
13 And the stars of heaven fell to the
earth, as a ﬁg tree drops its late ﬁgs
when it is shaken by a mighty wind.
14 Then the sky receded as a scroll when
it is rolled up, and every mountain and
island was moved out of its place.
15 And the kings of the earth, the great
men, the rich men, the commanders,
the mighty men, every slave and every
free man, hid themselves in the caves
and in the rocks of the mountains,
16 and said to the mountains and rocks,
"Fall on us and hide us from the face of
Him who sits on the throne and from the
wrath of the Lamb!REVELATION 6 – 7
24
17 "For the great day of His wrath has
come, and who is able to stand?"
1 A er these things I saw four angels
standing at the four corners of the
earth, holding the four winds of the
earth, that the wind should not blow on
the earth, on the sea, or on any tree.
2 Then I saw another angel ascending
from the east, having the seal of the
living God. And he cried with a loud
voice to the four angels to whom it was
granted to harm the earth and the sea,
3 saying, "Do not harm the earth, the
sea, or the trees ll we have sealed the
servants of our God on their foreheads."
4 And I heard the number of those
who were sealed. One hundred and
forty–four thousand of all the tribes of
the children of Israel were sealed:
5 of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand
were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben
twelve thousand were sealed; of the
7REVELATION 7
25
tribe of Gad twelve thousand were
sealed;
6 of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand
were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali
twelve thousand were sealed; of the
tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were
sealed;
7 of the tribe of Simeon twelve
thousand were sealed; of the tribe of
Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the
tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were
sealed;
8 of the tribe of Zebulun twelve
thousand were sealed; of the tribe of
Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of
the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand
were sealed.
9 A er these things I looked, and
behold, a great mul tude which no one
could number, of all na ons, tribes,
peoples, and tongues, standing before
the throne and before the Lamb, clothedREVELATION 7
26
with white robes, with palm branches in
their hands,
10 and crying out with a loud voice,
saying, "Salva on belongs to our God
who sits on the throne, and to the
Lamb!"
11 All the angels stood around the
throne and the elders and the four living
creatures, and fell on their faces before
the throne and worshiped God,
12 saying: "Amen! Blessing and glory
and wisdom, Thanksgiving and honor
and power and might, Be to our God
forever and ever. Amen."
13 Then one of the elders answered,
saying to me, "Who are these arrayed in
white robes, and where did they come
from?"
14 And I said to him, "Sir, you know."
So he said to me, "These are the ones
who come out of the great tribula on,REVELATION 7 – 8
27
and washed their robes and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb.
15 "Therefore they are before the
throne of God, and serve Him day and
night in His temple. And He who sits on
the throne will dwell among them.
16 "They shall neither hunger anymore
nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not
strike them, nor any heat;
17 "for the Lamb who is in the midst of
the throne will shepherd them and lead
them to living fountains of waters. And
God will wipe away every tear from their
eyes."
1 When He opened the seventh
seal, there was silence in heaven for
about half an hour.
2 And I saw the seven angels who stand
before God, and to them were given
seven trumpets.
3 Then another angel, having a golden
censer, came and stood at the altar. He
8REVELATION 8
28
was given much incense, that he should
oﬀer it with the prayers of all the saints
upon the golden altar which was before
the throne.
4 And the smoke of the incense, with
the prayers of the saints, ascended
before God from the angel’s hand.
5 Then the angel took the censer,
ﬁlled it with ﬁre from the altar, and
threw it to the earth. And there were
noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an
earthquake.
6 So the seven angels who had the
seven trumpets prepared themselves to
sound.
7 The ﬁrst angel sounded: And hail and
ﬁre followed, mingled with blood, and
they were thrown to the earth. And a
third of the trees were burned up, and
all green grass was burned up.
8 Then the second angel sounded: And
something like a great mountain burningREVELATION 8
29
with ﬁre was thrown into the sea, and a
third of the sea became blood.
9 And a third of the living creatures in
the sea died, and a third of the ships
were destroyed.
10 Then the third angel sounded: And a
great star fell from heaven, burning like
a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers
and on the springs of water.
11 The name of the star is Wormwood. A
third of the waters became wormwood,
and many men died from the water,
because it was made bi er.
12 Then the fourth angel sounded: And
a third of the sun was struck, a third
of the moon, and a third of the stars,
so that a third of them were darkened.
A third of the day did not shine, and
likewise the night.
13 And I looked, and I heard an angel
ﬂying through the midst of heaven,
saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe,REVELATION 9
30
woe to the inhabitants of the earth,
because of the remaining blasts of the
trumpet of the three angels who are
about to sound!"
1 Then the ﬁ h angel sounded: And
I saw a star fallen from heaven to the
earth. To him was given the key to the
bo omless pit.
2 And he opened the bo omless pit,
and smoke arose out of the pit like the
smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and
the air were darkened because of the
smoke of the pit.
3 Then out of the smoke locusts came
upon the earth. And to them was given
power, as the scorpions of the earth
have power.
4 They were commanded not to harm
the grass of the earth, or any green
thing, or any tree, but only those men
who do not have the seal of God on their
foreheads.
9REVELATION 9
31
5 And they were not given authority
to kill them, but to torment them for
ﬁve months. Their torment was like the
torment of a scorpion when it strikes a
man.
6 In those days men will seek death and
will not ﬁnd it; they will desire to die,
and death will ﬂee from them.
7 The shape of the locusts was like
horses prepared for ba le. On their
heads were crowns of something like
gold, and their faces were like the faces
of men.
8 They had hair like women’s hair, and
their teeth were like lions’ teeth.
9 And they had breastplates like
breastplates of iron, and the sound of
their wings was like the sound of chariots
with many horses running into ba le.
10 They had tails like scorpions, and
there were s ngs in their tails. Their
power was to hurt men ﬁve months.REVELATION 9
32
11 And they had as king over them the
angel of the bo omless pit, whose name
in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he
has the name Apollyon.
12 One woe is past. Behold, s ll two
more woes are coming a er these
things.
13 Then the sixth angel sounded: And I
heard a voice from the four horns of the
golden altar which is before God,
14 saying to the sixth angel who had the
trumpet, "Release the four angels who
are bound at the great river Euphrates."
15 So the four angels, who had been
prepared for the hour and day and
month and year, were released to kill a
third of mankind.
16 Now the number of the army of the
horsemen was two hundred million; I
heard the number of them.
17 And thus I saw the horses in the
vision: those who sat on them hadREVELATION 9
33
breastplates of ﬁery red, hyacinth blue,
and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the
horses were like the heads of lions; and
out of their mouths came ﬁre, smoke,
and brimstone.
18 By these three plagues a third of
mankind was killed––by the ﬁre and the
smoke and the brimstone which came
out of their mouths.
19 For their power is in their mouth
and in their tails; for their tails are like
serpents, having heads; and with them
they do harm.
20 But the rest of mankind, who were
not killed by these plagues, did not
repent of the works of their hands, that
they should not worship demons, and
idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and
wood, which can neither see nor hear
nor walk.REVELATION 9 – 10
34
21 And they did not repent of their
murders or their sorceries or their sexual
immorality or their the s.
1 I saw s ll another mighty angel
coming down from heaven,
clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was
on his head, his face was like the sun,
and his feet like pillars of ﬁre.
2 He had a li le book open in his hand.
And he set his right foot on the sea and
his le foot on the land,
3 and cried with a loud voice, as when
a lion roars. When he cried out, seven
thunders u ered their voices.
4 Now when the seven thunders u ered
their voices, I was about to write; but
I heard a voice from heaven saying to
me, "Seal up the things which the seven
thunders u ered, and do not write
them."
10REVELATION 10
35
5 The angel whom I saw standing on the
sea and on the land raised up his hand
to heaven
6 and swore by Him who lives forever
and ever, who created heaven and the
things that are in it, the earth and the
things that are in it, and the sea and the
things that are in it, that there should be
delay no longer,
7 but in the days of the sounding of
the seventh angel, when he is about to
sound, the mystery of God would be
ﬁnished, as He declared to His servants
the prophets.
8 Then the voice which I heard from
heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go,
take the li le book which is open in the
hand of the angel who stands on the sea
and on the earth."
9 So I went to the angel and said to
him, "Give me the li le book." And he
said to me, "Take and eat it; and it willREVELATION 10 – 11
36
make your stomach bi er, but it will be
as sweet as honey in your mouth."
10 Then I took the li le book out of the
angel’s hand and ate it, and it was as
sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I
had eaten it, my stomach became bi er.
11 And he said to me, "You must
prophesy again about many peoples,
na ons, tongues, and kings."
1 Then I was given a reed like a
measuring rod. And the angel
stood, saying, "Rise and measure the
temple of God, the altar, and those who
worship there.
2 "But leave out the court which
is outside the temple, and do not
measure it, for it has been given to the
Gen les. And they will tread the holy
city underfoot for forty–two months.
3 "And I will give power to my two
witnesses, and they will prophesy one
11REVELATION 11
37
thousand two hundred and sixty days,
clothed in sackcloth."
4 These are the two olive trees and the
two lampstands standing before the God
of the earth.
5 And if anyone wants to harm them,
ﬁre proceeds from their mouth and
devours their enemies. And if anyone
wants to harm them, he must be killed
in this manner.
6 These have power to shut heaven,
so that no rain falls in the days of their
prophecy; and they have power over
waters to turn them to blood, and to
strike the earth with all plagues, as o en
as they desire.
7 When they ﬁnish their tes mony,
the beast that ascends out of the
bo omless pit will make war against
them, overcome them, and kill them.
8 And their dead bodies will lie in the
street of the great city which spirituallyREVELATION 11
38
is called Sodom and Egypt, where also
our Lord was cruciﬁed.
9 Then those from the peoples, tribes,
tongues, and na ons will see their dead
bodies three–and–a–half days, and not
allow their dead bodies to be put into
graves.
10 And those who dwell on the earth
will rejoice over them, make merry, and
send gi s to one another, because these
two prophets tormented those who
dwell on the earth.
11 Now a er the three–and–a–half days
the breath of life from God entered
them, and they stood on their feet, and
great fear fell on those who saw them.
12 And they heard a loud voice from
heaven saying to them, "Come up here."
And they ascended to heaven in a cloud,
and their enemies saw them.
13 In the same hour there was a great
earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. InREVELATION 11
39
the earthquake seven thousand people
were killed, and the rest were afraid and
gave glory to the God of heaven.
14 The second woe is past. Behold, the
third woe is coming quickly.
15 Then the seventh angel sounded:
And there were loud voices in heaven,
saying, "The kingdoms of this world have
become the kingdoms of our Lord and of
His Christ, and He shall reign forever and
ever!"
16 And the twenty–four elders who sat
before God on their thrones fell on their
faces and worshiped God,
17 saying: "We give You thanks, O Lord
God Almighty, The One who is and
who was and who is to come, Because
You have taken Your great power and
reigned.
18 The na ons were angry, and Your
wrath has come, And the me of the
dead, that they should be judged, AndREVELATION 11 – 12
40
that You should reward Your servants
the prophets and the saints, And those
who fear Your name, small and great,
And should destroy those who destroy
the earth."
19 Then the temple of God was opened
in heaven, and the ark of His covenant
was seen in His temple. And there
were lightnings, noises, thunderings, an
earthquake, and great hail.
1 Now a great sign appeared in
heaven: a woman clothed with
the sun, with the moon under her feet,
and on her head a garland of twelve
stars.
2 Then being with child, she cried out in
labor and in pain to give birth.
3 And another sign appeared in heaven:
behold, a great, ﬁery red dragon having
seven heads and ten horns, and seven
diadems on his heads.
12REVELATION 12
41
4 His tail drew a third of the stars of
heaven and threw them to the earth.
And the dragon stood before the woman
who was ready to give birth, to devour
her Child as soon as it was born.
5 She bore a male Child who was to
rule all na ons with a rod of iron. And
her Child was caught up to God and His
throne.
6 Then the woman ﬂed into the
wilderness, where she has a place
prepared by God, that they should feed
her there one thousand two hundred
and sixty days.
7 And war broke out in heaven: Michael
and his angels fought with the dragon;
and the dragon and his angels fought,
8 but they did not prevail, nor was a
place found for them in heaven any
longer.
9 So the great dragon was cast out,
that serpent of old, called the Devil andREVELATION 12
42
Satan, who deceives the whole world;
he was cast to the earth, and his angels
were cast out with him.
10 Then I heard a loud voice saying in
heaven, "Now salva on, and strength,
and the kingdom of our God, and the
power of His Christ have come, for the
accuser of our brethren, who accused
them before our God day and night, has
been cast down.
11 "And they overcame him by the
blood of the Lamb and by the word of
their tes mony, and they did not love
their lives to the death.
12 "Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and
you who dwell in them! Woe to the
inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For
the devil has come down to you, having
great wrath, because he knows that he
has a short me."
13 Now when the dragon saw that
he had been cast to the earth, heREVELATION 12
43
persecuted the woman who gave birth
to the male Child.
14 But the woman was given two wings
of a great eagle, that she might ﬂy into
the wilderness to her place, where she
is nourished for a me and mes and
half a me, from the presence of the
serpent.
15 So the serpent spewed water out of
his mouth like a ﬂood a er the woman,
that he might cause her to be carried
away by the ﬂood.
16 But the earth helped the woman,
and the earth opened its mouth and
swallowed up the ﬂood which the
dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
17 And the dragon was enraged with
the woman, and he went to make war
with the rest of her oﬀspring, who keep
the commandments of God and have
the tes mony of Jesus Christ.REVELATION 13
13
44
1 Then I stood on the sand of the
sea. And I saw a beast rising up
out of the sea, having seven heads and
ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns,
and on his heads a blasphemous name.
2 Now the beast which I saw was like a
leopard, his feet were like the feet of a
bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a
lion. The dragon gave him his power, his
throne, and great authority.
3 And I saw one of his heads as if it had
been mortally wounded, and his deadly
wound was healed. And all the world
marveled and followed the beast.
4 So they worshiped the dragon who
gave authority to the beast; and they
worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like
the beast? Who is able to make war with
him?"
5 And he was given a mouth speaking
great things and blasphemies, and heREVELATION 13
45
was given authority to con nue for
forty–two months.
6 Then he opened his mouth in
blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
His name, His tabernacle, and those who
dwell in heaven.
7 It was granted to him to make war
with the saints and to overcome them.
And authority was given him over every
tribe, tongue, and na on.
8 All who dwell on the earth will
worship him, whose names have not
been wri en in the Book of Life of the
Lamb slain from the founda on of the
world.
9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
10 He who leads into cap vity shall
go into cap vity; he who kills with the
sword must be killed with the sword.
Here is the pa ence and the faith of the
saints.REVELATION 13
46
11 Then I saw another beast coming up
out of the earth, and he had two horns
like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.
12 And he exercises all the authority
of the ﬁrst beast in his presence, and
causes the earth and those who dwell
in it to worship the ﬁrst beast, whose
deadly wound was healed.
13 He performs great signs, so that
he even makes ﬁre come down from
heaven on the earth in the sight of men.
14 And he deceives those who dwell on
the earth by those signs which he was
granted to do in the sight of the beast,
telling those who dwell on the earth to
make an image to the beast who was
wounded by the sword and lived.
15 He was granted power to give breath
to the image of the beast, that the image
of the beast should both speak and
cause as many as would not worship the
image of the beast to be killed.REVELATION 13 – 14
47
16 He causes all, both small and great,
rich and poor, free and slave, to receive
a mark on their right hand or on their
foreheads,
17 and that no one may buy or sell
except one who has the mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his
name.
18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has
understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for it is the number of a man:
His number is 666.
1 Then I looked, and behold,
a Lamb standing on Mount
Zion, and with Him one hundred and
forty–four thousand, having His Father’s
name wri en on their foreheads.
2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like
the voice of many waters, and like the
voice of loud thunder. And I heard the
sound of harpists playing their harps.
14REVELATION 14
48
3 They sang as it were a new song
before the throne, before the four
living creatures, and the elders; and no
one could learn that song except the
hundred and forty–four thousand who
were redeemed from the earth.
4 These are the ones who were not
deﬁled with women, for they are virgins.
These are the ones who follow the
Lamb wherever He goes. These were
redeemed from among men, being
ﬁrs ruits to God and to the Lamb.
5 And in their mouth was found no
deceit, for they are without fault before
the throne of God.
6 Then I saw another angel ﬂying in the
midst of heaven, having the everlas ng
gospel to preach to those who dwell
on the earth––to every na on, tribe,
tongue, and people––
7 saying with a loud voice, "Fear God
and give glory to Him, for the hour of HisREVELATION 14
49
judgment has come; and worship Him
who made heaven and earth, the sea
and springs of water."
8 And another angel followed, saying,
"Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great
city, because she has made all na ons
drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornica on."
9 Then a third angel followed them,
saying with a loud voice, "If anyone
worships the beast and his image, and
receives his mark on his forehead or on
his hand,
10 "he himself shall also drink of the
wine of the wrath of God, which is
poured out full strength into the cup of
His indigna on. He shall be tormented
with ﬁre and brimstone in the presence
of the holy angels and in the presence of
the Lamb.
11 "And the smoke of their torment
ascends forever and ever; and theyREVELATION 14
50
have no rest day or night, who worship
the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name."
12 Here is the pa ence of the
saints; here are those who keep the
commandments of God and the faith of
Jesus.
13 Then I heard a voice from heaven
saying to me, "Write: ‘Blessed are the
dead who die in the Lord from now on.’"
"Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest
from their labors, and their works follow
them."
14 Then I looked, and behold, a white
cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the
Son of Man, having on His head a golden
crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.
15 And another angel came out of the
temple, crying with a loud voice to Him
who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your
sickle and reap, for the me has comeREVELATION 14
51
for You to reap, for the harvest of the
earth is ripe."
16 So He who sat on the cloud thrust
in His sickle on the earth, and the earth
was reaped.
17 Then another angel came out of
the temple which is in heaven, he also
having a sharp sickle.
18 And another angel came out from
the altar, who had power over ﬁre, and
he cried with a loud cry to him who had
the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your
sharp sickle and gather the clusters of
the vine of the earth, for her grapes are
fully ripe."
19 So the angel thrust his sickle into the
earth and gathered the vine of the earth,
and threw it into the great winepress of
the wrath of God.
20 And the winepress was trampled
outside the city, and blood came out ofREVELATION 15
52
the winepress, up to the horses’ bridles,
for one thousand six hundred furlongs.
1 Then I saw another sign in
heaven, great and marvelous:
seven angels having the seven last
plagues, for in them the wrath of God is
complete.
2 And I saw something like a sea of
glass mingled with ﬁre, and those who
have the victory over the beast, over his
image and over his mark and over the
number of his name, standing on the sea
of glass, having harps of God.
3 They sing the song of Moses, the
servant of God, and the song of the
Lamb, saying: "Great and marvelous are
Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and
true are Your ways, O King of the saints!
4 Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and
glorify Your name? For You alone are
holy. For all na ons shall come and
15REVELATION 15 – 16
53
worship before You, For Your judgments
have been manifested."
5 A er these things I looked, and
behold, the temple of the tabernacle of
the tes mony in heaven was opened.
6 And out of the temple came the seven
angels having the seven plagues, clothed
in pure bright linen, and having their
chests girded with golden bands.
7 Then one of the four living creatures
gave to the seven angels seven golden
bowls full of the wrath of God who lives
forever and ever.
8 The temple was ﬁlled with smoke
from the glory of God and from His
power, and no one was able to enter
the temple ll the seven plagues of the
seven angels were completed.
1 Then I heard a loud voice from
the temple saying to the seven
angels, "Go and pour out the bowls of
the wrath of God on the earth."
16REVELATION 16
54
2 So the ﬁrst went and poured out his
bowl upon the earth, and a foul and
loathsome sore came upon the men who
had the mark of the beast and those
who worshiped his image.
3 Then the second angel poured out his
bowl on the sea, and it became blood as
of a dead man; and every living creature
in the sea died.
4 Then the third angel poured out his
bowl on the rivers and springs of water,
and they became blood.
5 And I heard the angel of the waters
saying: "You are righteous, O Lord, The
One who is and who was and who is
to be, Because You have judged these
things.
6 For they have shed the blood of saints
and prophets, And You have given them
blood to drink. For it is their just due."REVELATION 16
55
7 And I heard another from the altar
saying, "Even so, Lord God Almighty, true
and righteous are Your judgments."
8 Then the fourth angel poured out his
bowl on the sun, and power was given
to him to scorch men with ﬁre.
9 And men were scorched with great
heat, and they blasphemed the name of
God who has power over these plagues;
and they did not repent and give Him
glory.
10 Then the ﬁ h angel poured out his
bowl on the throne of the beast, and his
kingdom became full of darkness; and
they gnawed their tongues because of
the pain.
11 They blasphemed the God of heaven
because of their pains and their sores,
and did not repent of their deeds.
12 Then the sixth angel poured out his
bowl on the great river Euphrates, and
its water was dried up, so that the wayREVELATION 16
56
of the kings from the east might be
prepared.
13 And I saw three unclean spirits
like frogs coming out of the mouth of
the dragon, out of the mouth of the
beast, and out of the mouth of the false
prophet.
14 For they are spirits of demons,
performing signs, which go out to the
kings of the earth and of the whole
world, to gather them to the ba le of
that great day of God Almighty.
15 "Behold, I am coming as a thief.
Blessed is he who watches, and keeps
his garments, lest he walk naked and
they see his shame."
16 And they gathered them together to
the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
17 Then the seventh angel poured out
his bowl into the air, and a loud voice
came out of the temple of heaven, from
the throne, saying, "It is done!"REVELATION 16 – 17
57
18 And there were noises and
thunderings and lightnings; and there
was a great earthquake, such a mighty
and great earthquake as had not
occurred since men were on the earth.
19 Now the great city was divided into
three parts, and the ci es of the na ons
fell. And great Babylon was remembered
before God, to give her the cup of the
wine of the ﬁerceness of His wrath.
20 Then every island ﬂed away, and the
mountains were not found.
21 And great hail from heaven fell upon
men, each hailstone about the weight of
a talent. Men blasphemed God because
of the plague of the hail, since that
plague was exceedingly great.
1 Then one of the seven angels
who had the seven bowls came
and talked with me, saying to me,
"Come, I will show you the judgment
17REVELATION 17
58
of the great harlot who sits on many
waters,
2 "with whom the kings of the
earth commi ed fornica on, and the
inhabitants of the earth were made
drunk with the wine of her fornica on."
3 So he carried me away in the Spirit
into the wilderness. And I saw a woman
si ng on a scarlet beast which was full
of names of blasphemy, having seven
heads and ten horns.
4 The woman was arrayed in purple
and scarlet, and adorned with gold and
precious stones and pearls, having in her
hand a golden cup full of abomina ons
and the ﬁlthiness of her fornica on.
5 And on her forehead a name was
wri en: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,
THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
6 I saw the woman, drunk with the
blood of the saints and with the bloodREVELATION 17
59
of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw
her, I marveled with great amazement.
7 But the angel said to me, "Why did
you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of
the woman and of the beast that carries
her, which has the seven heads and the
ten horns.
8 "The beast that you saw was, and
is not, and will ascend out of the
bo omless pit and go to perdi on.
And those who dwell on the earth will
marvel, whose names are not wri en in
the Book of Life from the founda on of
the world, when they see the beast that
was, and is not, and yet is.
9 "Here is the mind which has wisdom:
The seven heads are seven mountains
on which the woman sits.
10 "There are also seven kings. Five
have fallen, one is, and the other has not
yet come. And when he comes, he must
con nue a short me.REVELATION 17
60
11 "And the beast that was, and is not,
is himself also the eighth, and is of the
seven, and is going to perdi on.
12 "The ten horns which you saw are
ten kings who have received no kingdom
as yet, but they receive authority for one
hour as kings with the beast.
13 "These are of one mind, and they will
give their power and authority to the
beast.
14 "These will make war with the Lamb,
and the Lamb will overcome them, for
He is Lord of lords and King of kings;
and those who are with Him are called,
chosen, and faithful."
15 Then he said to me, "The waters
which you saw, where the harlot sits,
are peoples, mul tudes, na ons, and
tongues.
16 "And the ten horns which you saw
on the beast, these will hate the harlot,REVELATION 17 – 18
61
make her desolate and naked, eat her
ﬂesh and burn her with ﬁre.
17 "For God has put it into their hearts
to fulﬁll His purpose, to be of one mind,
and to give their kingdom to the beast,
un l the words of God are fulﬁlled.
18 "And the woman whom you saw is
that great city which reigns over the
kings of the earth."
1 A er these things I saw another
angel coming down from heaven,
having great authority, and the earth
was illuminated with his glory.
2 And he cried migh ly with a loud
voice, saying, "Babylon the great is
fallen, is fallen, and has become a
dwelling place of demons, a prison for
every foul spirit, and a cage for every
unclean and hated bird!
3 "For all the na ons have drunk of the
wine of the wrath of her fornica on,
the kings of the earth have commi ed
18REVELATION 18
62
fornica on with her, and the merchants
of the earth have become rich through
the abundance of her luxury."
4 And I heard another voice from
heaven saying, "Come out of her, my
people, lest you share in her sins, and
lest you receive of her plagues.
5 "For her sins have reached to heaven,
and God has remembered her iniqui es.
6 "Render to her just as she rendered
to you, and repay her double according
to her works; in the cup which she has
mixed, mix double for her.
7 "In the measure that she gloriﬁed
herself and lived luxuriously, in the same
measure give her torment and sorrow;
for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as queen,
and am no widow, and will not see
sorrow.’
8 "Therefore her plagues will come
in one day––death and mourning and
famine. And she will be u erly burnedREVELATION 18
63
with ﬁre, for strong is the Lord God who
judges her.
9 "The kings of the earth who commi ed
fornica on and lived luxuriously with her
will weep and lament for her, when they
see the smoke of her burning,
10 "standing at a distance for fear of her
torment, saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great
city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one
hour your judgment has come.’
11 "And the merchants of the earth will
weep and mourn over her, for no one
buys their merchandise anymore:
12 "merchandise of gold and silver,
precious stones and pearls, ﬁne linen
and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind
of citron wood, every kind of object
of ivory, every kind of object of most
precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;
13 "and cinnamon and incense, fragrant

64
horses and chariots, and bodies and
souls of men.
14 "The fruit that your soul longed for
has gone from you, and all the things
which are rich and splendid have gone
from you, and you shall ﬁnd them no

15 "The merchants of these things,
who became rich by her, will stand
at a distance for fear of her torment,
weeping and wailing,
16 "and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city
that was clothed in ﬁne linen, purple,
and scarlet, and adorned with gold and
precious stones and pearls!
17 ‘For in one hour such great riches
came to nothing.’ Every shipmaster, all
who travel by ship, sailors, and as many
as trade on the sea, stood at a distance
18 "and cried out when they saw the
smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is
like this great city?’REVELATION 18
65
19 "They threw dust on their heads
and cried out, weeping and wailing,
and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city,
in which all who had ships on the sea
became rich by her wealth! For in one
hour she is made desolate.’
20 "Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you
holy apostles and prophets, for God has
avenged you on her!"
21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone
like a great millstone and threw it into
the sea, saying, "Thus with violence the
great city Babylon shall be thrown down,
and shall not be found anymore.
22 "The sound of harpists, musicians,
ﬂu sts, and trumpeters shall not be
heard in you anymore. No cra sman of

and the sound of a millstone shall not be
heard in you anymore.
23 "The light of a lamp shall not shine
in you anymore, and the voice ofREVELATION 18 – 19
66
bridegroom and bride shall not be heard
in you anymore. For your merchants
were the great men of the earth, for
by your sorcery all the na ons were
deceived.
24 "And in her was found the blood of
prophets and saints, and of all who were
slain on the earth."
1 A er these things I heard a
loud voice of a great mul tude in
heaven, saying, "Alleluia! Salva on and
glory and honor and power belong to
the Lord our God!
2 "For true and righteous are His
judgments, because He has judged the
great harlot who corrupted the earth
with her fornica on; and He has avenged
on her the blood of His servants shed by
her."
3 Again they said, "Alleluia! Her smoke
rises up forever and ever!"
19REVELATION 19
67
4 And the twenty–four elders and
the four living creatures fell down and
worshiped God who sat on the throne,
saying, "Amen! Alleluia!"
5 Then a voice came from the throne,
saying, "Praise our God, all you His
servants and those who fear Him, both
small and great!"
6 And I heard, as it were, the voice
of a great mul tude, as the sound of
many waters and as the sound of mighty
thunderings, saying, "Alleluia! For the
Lord God Omnipotent reigns!
7 "Let us be glad and rejoice and give
Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb
has come, and His wife has made herself
ready."
8 And to her it was granted to be
arrayed in ﬁne linen, clean and bright,
for the ﬁne linen is the righteous acts of
the saints.REVELATION 19
68
9 Then he said to me, "Write: ‘Blessed
are those who are called to the marriage
supper of the Lamb!’" And he said to
me, "These are the true sayings of God."
10 And I fell at his feet to worship him.
But he said to me, "See that you do not
do that! I am your fellow servant, and of
your brethren who have the tes mony
of Jesus. Worship God! For the tes mony
of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
11 Now I saw heaven opened, and
behold, a white horse. And He who sat
on him was called Faithful and True, and
in righteousness He judges and makes
war.
12 His eyes were like a ﬂame of ﬁre, and
on His head were many crowns. He had
a name wri en that no one knew except
Himself.
13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in
blood, and His name is called The Word
of God.REVELATION 19
69
14 And the armies in heaven, clothed in
ﬁne linen, white and clean, followed Him
on white horses.
15 Now out of His mouth goes a sharp
sword, that with it He should strike the
na ons. And He Himself will rule them
with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the
winepress of the ﬁerceness and wrath of
Almighty God.
16 And He has on His robe and on His
thigh a name wri en: KING OF KINGS
AND LORD OF LORDS.
17 Then I saw an angel standing in the
sun; and he cried with a loud voice,
saying to all the birds that ﬂy in the midst
of heaven, "Come and gather together
for the supper of the great God,
18 "that you may eat the ﬂesh of kings,
the ﬂesh of captains, the ﬂesh of mighty
men, the ﬂesh of horses and of those
who sit on them, and the ﬂesh of allREVELATION 19 – 20
70
people, free and slave, both small and
great."
19 And I saw the beast, the kings of
the earth, and their armies, gathered
together to make war against Him who
sat on the horse and against His army.
20 Then the beast was captured, and
with him the false prophet who worked
signs in his presence, by which he
deceived those who received the mark
of the beast and those who worshiped
his image. These two were cast alive into
the lake of ﬁre burning with brimstone.
21 And the rest were killed with the
sword which proceeded from the mouth
of Him who sat on the horse. And all the
birds were ﬁlled with their ﬂesh.
1 Then I saw an angel coming
down from heaven, having the
key to the bo omless pit and a great
chain in his hand.
20REVELATION 20
71
2 He laid hold of the dragon, that
serpent of old, who is the Devil and
Satan, and bound him for a thousand
years;
3 and he cast him into the bo omless
pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
on him, so that he should deceive the
na ons no more ll the thousand years
were ﬁnished. But a er these things he
must be released for a li le while.
4 And I saw thrones, and they sat on
them, and judgment was commi ed to
them. Then I saw the souls of those who
had been beheaded for their witness
to Jesus and for the word of God, who
had not worshiped the beast or his
image, and had not received his mark on
their foreheads or on their hands. And
they lived and reigned with Christ for a
thousand years.REVELATION 20
72
5 But the rest of the dead did not live
again un l the thousand years were
ﬁnished. This is the ﬁrst resurrec on.
6 Blessed and holy is he who has part
in the ﬁrst resurrec on. Over such the
second death has no power, but they
shall be priests of God and of Christ, and
shall reign with Him a thousand years.
7 Now when the thousand years have
expired, Satan will be released from his
prison
8 and will go out to deceive the na ons
which are in the four corners of the
earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them
together to ba le, whose number is as
the sand of the sea.
9 They went up on the breadth of the
earth and surrounded the camp of the
saints and the beloved city. And ﬁre
came down from God out of heaven and
devoured them.REVELATION 20
73
10 The devil, who deceived them, was
cast into the lake of ﬁre and brimstone
where the beast and the false prophet
are. And they will be tormented day and
night forever and ever.
11 Then I saw a great white throne and
Him who sat on it, from whose face the
earth and the heaven ﬂed away. And
there was found no place for them.
12 And I saw the dead, small and great,
standing before God, and books were
opened. And another book was opened,
which is the Book of Life. And the dead
were judged according to their works,
by the things which were wri en in the
books.
13 The sea gave up the dead who were
in it, and Death and Hades delivered up
the dead who were in them. And they
were judged, each one according to his
works.REVELATION 20 – 21
74
14 Then Death and Hades were cast into
the lake of ﬁre. This is the second death.
15 And anyone not found wri en in the
Book of Life was cast into the lake of ﬁre.
1 Now I saw a new heaven and
a new earth, for the ﬁrst heaven
and the ﬁrst earth had passed away. Also
there was no more sea.
2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
from God, prepared as a bride adorned
for her husband.
3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven
saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
is with men, and He will dwell with
them, and they shall be His people. God
Himself will be with them and be their
God.
4 "And God will wipe away every tear
from their eyes; there shall be no more
death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There
21REVELATION 21
75
shall be no more pain, for the former
things have passed away."
5 Then He who sat on the throne said,
"Behold, I make all things new." And He
said to me, "Write, for these words are
true and faithful."
6 And He said to me, "It is done! I am
the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning
and the End. I will give of the fountain
of the water of life freely to him who
thirsts.
7 "He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he shall
be My son.
8 "But the cowardly, unbelieving,
abominable, murderers, sexually
immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all
liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with ﬁre and brimstone,
which is the second death."
9 Then one of the seven angels who had
the seven bowls ﬁlled with the seven lastREVELATION 21
76
plagues came to me and talked with me,
saying, "Come, I will show you the bride,
the Lamb’s wife."
10 And he carried me away in the
Spirit to a great and high mountain,
and showed me the great city, the holy
Jerusalem, descending out of heaven
from God,
11 having the glory of God. Her light was
like a most precious stone, like a jasper
stone, clear as crystal.
12 Also she had a great and high wall
with twelve gates, and twelve angels at
the gates, and names wri en on them,
which are the names of the twelve tribes
of the children of Israel:
13 three gates on the east, three gates
on the north, three gates on the south,
and three gates on the west.
14 Now the wall of the city had twelve
founda ons, and on them were theREVELATION 21
77
names of the twelve apostles of the
Lamb.
15 And he who talked with me had a
gold reed to measure the city, its gates,
and its wall.
16 The city is laid out as a square; its
length is as great as its breadth. And he
measured the city with the reed: twelve
thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth,
and height are equal.
17 Then he measured its wall: one
hundred and forty–four cubits,
according to the measure of a man, that
is, of an angel.
18 The construc on of its wall was of
jasper; and the city was pure gold, like
clear glass.
19 The founda ons of the wall of the
city were adorned with all kinds of
precious stones: the ﬁrst founda on was
jasper, the second sapphire, the third
chalcedony, the fourth emerald,REVELATION 21
20 the ﬁ
78
h sardonyx, the sixth sardius,
the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl,
the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase,
the eleventh jacinth, and the twel h
amethyst.
21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls:
each individual gate was of one pearl.
And the street of the city was pure gold,
like transparent glass.
22 But I saw no temple in it, for the
Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its
temple.
23 The city had no need of the sun or of
the moon to shine in it, for the glory of
God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.
24 And the na ons of those who are
saved shall walk in its light, and the kings
of the earth bring their glory and honor
into it.
25 Its gates shall not be shut at all by
day (there shall be no night there).REVELATION 21 – 22
79
26 And they shall bring the glory and the
honor of the na ons into it.
27 But there shall by no means enter
it anything that deﬁles, or causes an
abomina on or a lie, but only those who
are wri en in the Lamb’s Book of Life.
1 And he showed me a pure river
of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding from the throne of God and
of the Lamb.
2 In the middle of its street, and on
either side of the river, was the tree of
life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree
yielding its fruit every month. The leaves
of the tree were for the healing of the
na ons.
3 And there shall be no more curse, but
the throne of God and of the Lamb shall
be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.
4 They shall see His face, and His name
shall be on their foreheads.
22REVELATION 22
80
5 There shall be no night there: They
need no lamp nor light of the sun, for
the Lord God gives them light. And they
shall reign forever and ever.
6 Then he said to me, "These words
are faithful and true." And the Lord God
of the holy prophets sent His angel to
show His servants the things which must
shortly take place.
7 "Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed
is he who keeps the words of the
prophecy of this book."
8 Now I, John, saw and heard these
things. And when I heard and saw, I fell
down to worship before the feet of the
angel who showed me these things.
9 Then he said to me, "See that you do
not do that. For I am your fellow servant,
and of your brethren the prophets, and
of those who keep the words of this
book. Worship God."REVELATION 22
81
10 And he said to me, "Do not seal the
words of the prophecy of this book, for
the me is at hand.
11 "He who is unjust, let him be unjust
s ll; he who is ﬁlthy, let him be ﬁlthy s ll;
he who is righteous, let him be righteous
s ll; he who is holy, let him be holy s ll."
12 "And behold, I am coming quickly,
and My reward is with Me, to give to
every one according to his work.
13 "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End, the First and the
Last."
14 Blessed are those who do His
commandments, that they may have the
right to the tree of life, and may enter
through the gates into the city.
15 But outside are dogs and sorcerers
and sexually immoral and murderers
and idolaters, and whoever loves and
prac ces a lie.REVELATION 22
16 "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to tes
82
fy
to you these things in the churches. I am
the Root and the Oﬀspring of David, the
Bright and Morning Star."
17 And the Spirit and the bride say,
"Come!" And let him who hears say,
"Come!" And let him who thirsts come.
Whoever desires, let him take the water
of life freely.
18 For I tes fy to everyone who hears
the words of the prophecy of this book:
If anyone adds to these things, God will
add to him the plagues that are wri en
in this book;
19 and if anyone takes away from the
words of the book of this prophecy, God
shall take away his part from the Book
of Life, from the holy city, and from the
things which are wri en in this book.
20 He who tes ﬁes to these things says,
"Surely I am coming quickly." Amen.
Even so, come, Lord Jesus!REVELATION 22
83
21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.
