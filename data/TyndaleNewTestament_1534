19 Her husband Joseph,
be-
ing righteous and not willing
to shame her publicly, in-
tended to send her away pri-
vately. 20 But as he thought
about these things, behold,
an angel of the Lord ap-
peared to him in a dream
and said, “Joseph, Son of
David, do not be afraid to
receive Mary as yoʋr wife,
for the child that is con-
ceived in her is from the
Holy Spirit. 21 She will give
birth to a son, and yoʋ shall
name him Jesus, for he will
save his people from their
sins.” 22 All this took place
to fulfill what the Lord had
spoken through the prophet:
the virgin will
conceive and give
birth to a son,
and they will name him Im-
manuel”
23 “Behold,
(which means, “God with
us”). 24 When Joseph awoke
from his sleep, he did as
the angel of the Lord com-
manded him. He took his
wife, 25 but knew her not
until she had given birth to
§her firstborn son. And he
named him Jesus.

The Visit of the Wise Men
1 After Jesus was born in
Bethlehem of Judea, in the
days of Herod the king, be-
hold, wise men from the
east arrived in Jerusalem,
2 saying,
“Where is the
child who has been born
king of the Jews? For we
saw his star in the east
and have come to worship
him.” 3 When Herod the
king heard this, he was trou-
bled, and all Jerusalem with
him. 4 So he assembled all
the chief priests and scribes
of the people, and inquired
of them where the Christ
was to be born. 5 They told
him, “In Bethlehem of Judea,
for so it is written by the
prophet,
6 ‘But yoʋ Bethlehem, land of
Judah,
are by no means least among
the rulers of Judah;
for from yoʋ will come a
ruler
who will shepherd my peo-
ple Israel.’ ”
7 Then
Herod secretly
called the wise men and
ascertained
from
them
what time the star had
appeared. 8 He sent them
to Bethlehem and said, “Go
search diligently for the
child, and when you have
found him, bring me word
so that I too may come
and worship him.” 9 They
listened to the king and went
on their way, and behold,
the star that they had seen
in the east went before them
until it came and stopped
over the place where the

saw the star, they rejoiced
with exceedingly great joy.
11 As they came into the

house and *saw the child
with Mary his mother, they
fell down and worshiped
him. Then they opened their
treasures and offered him
gifts:
gold, frankincense,
and myrrh. 12 And being
warned in a dream not
to return to Herod, they
departed for their own
country by another way.
The Escape to Egypt
they were gone,
behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a
dream, saying, “Rise, take
the child and his mother
and flee to Egypt, and stay
there until I tell yoʋ, for
Herod is about to seek the
child, to destroy him.” 14 So
Joseph rose, took the child
and his mother by night, and
departed for Egypt, 15 where
he stayed until the death
of Herod. This was to ful-
fill what the Lord had said
through the prophet: “Out of
Egypt I called my son.”
13 After
The Massacre of the Inno-
cent Children
16 When Herod saw that
he had been fooled by the
wise men, he was greatly
enraged and sent men to kill
all the boys in Bethlehem
and in its vicinity who were
two years old and under,
according to the time that
he had ascertained from the
wise men. 17 Then what had
been spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled:
“A voice was heard in
Ramah,
†wailing, weeping, and great
lamentation,
Rachel weeping for her chil-
dren,
and she would not be com-
forted, because they
are no more.”
18
The Return to Nazareth
Herod died, be-
hold, an angel of the Lord
appeared in a dream to
Joseph in Egypt, 20 saying,
“Rise, take the child and
his mother, and go to the
land of Israel, for those who
sought the life of the child
21 So Joseph
are dead.”
rose, took the child and his
mother, and went to the land
of Israel. 22 But when he
heard that Archelaus was
reigning over Judea instead
of his father Herod, he was
afraid to go there. And being
warned in a dream, he with-
drew to the district of Galilee
23 and came and dwelt in
a town called Nazareth, so
that what had been spoken
by the prophets might be
fulfilled: “He will be called
a Nazarene.”

The Preaching of John the
Baptist
1 In those days John the
Baptist came preaching in
the wilderness of Judea,
2 “Repent, for the kingdom
of heaven has drawn near.”

spoken of by Isaiah the
prophet, who said,

the devil left him,
and behold, angels came and

Jesus Begins His Ministry
12 Now when Jesus heard
that John had been put
in prison, he withdrew to
13 And leaving
Galilee.
Nazareth, he went and dwelt
at Capernaum by the sea, in
the region of Zebulun and
Naphtali, 14 so that what had
been spoken by Isaiah the
prophet might be fulfilled:
15 “Land of Zebulun and land
7 Jesus said to him, “Againof Naphtali,

and on those sitting in the

‘Yoʋ shall worship the
Lord yoʋr God,
and him only shall yoʋ
serve.’ ”17 From that time Jesus
began to preach, “Repent,
for the kingdom of heaven
has drawn near.”
Jesus Calls His First Disci-
ples
18 As Jesus was walking
by the Sea of Galilee, he
saw two brothers, Simon
(who is called Peter) and
Andrew his brother, casting
a net into the sea, for they

said to them, “Follow me,
and I will make you fish-

immediately left their nets

concerning yoʋ,’
and,
‘In their hands they will lift
yoʋ up,
so that yoʋ do not strike yoʋr
foot against a stone.’ ”
it is written, ‘Yoʋ shall
not put the Lord yoʋr God
to the test.’ ” 8 Again, the
devil took him to a very
high mountain and showed
him all the kingdoms of the
world and their glory. 9 And
he said to him, “All these
things I will give yoʋ, if yoʋ
will fall down and worship
me.” 10 Then Jesus said to
him, “†Get behind me, Sa-
tan! For it is written,
† 4:10 Get behind me 87.6% ¦ Go away CT TR 11.7%THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 4:216THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 5:13
and followed him. 21 Going
on from there, he saw two
other brothers, James the
son of Zebedee and John his
brother, in the boat with
Zebedee their father, mend-
ing their nets, and he called
them. 22 So they immedi-
ately left the boat and their
father and followed him.
Jesus Ministers to Great
Crowds
23
Then
Jesus
went
throughout all of Galilee,
teaching in their syna-
gogues, preaching the gospel
of the kingdom, and healing
every disease and every
sickness among the people.
24 So the news about him
went out into all of Syria,
and the people brought
to him all who were sick
with various diseases, those
suffering severe pain, the
demon-possessed, epileptics,
and paralytics.
And he

large crowds followed him
from Galilee, the Decapolis,
Jerusalem, Judea, and from
beyond the Jordan.

The Beatitudes
When Jesus saw the
crowds, he went up on the
mountain.
And when he
sat down, his disciples came
to him. 2 Then he opened
his mouth and taught them,
saying,
1
3 “Blessed are the poor in
spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.
4 Blessed are those who
mourn,
for they will be com-
forted.
5 Blessed are the meek,
for they will inherit the
earth.
6 Blessed are those who
hunger and thirst
for righteousness,
for they will be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful,
for they will receive
mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in
heart,
for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peace-
makers,
for they will be called sons
of God.
10 Blessed are those who
are persecuted for
righteousness' sake,
for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.
11 Blessed
are you when
others reproach you, per-
secute you, and say all
kinds of evil against you
falsely on my account.
12 Rejoice and be glad, for
great is your reward in
heaven; for in the same
way they persecuted the
prophets who were before
you.

16 Let your light shine be-

21 “You have heard that

17 “Do not think that I

the law until all is accom-

of the least of these com-

and teaches them will be
called great in the king-

I too am a man *under au-

me. I say to this one, ‘Go,’
and he goes; and to another,
‘Come,’ and he comes; and
to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and
he does it.” 10 When Jesus
heard this, he was amazed
and said to those who were
following him, “Truly I say
to you, †not even in Is-
rael have I found such
great faith. 11 I tell you
that many will come from
east and west, and recline

Jacob at the banquet ta-

the kingdom will be cast

in that place there will be

When Jesus saw their faith,
he said to the paralytic,
“Take courage, son; yoʋr

3 And behold, some of the
scribes said to themselves,
“This man is blaspheming.”
4 ‡Perceiving their thoughts,
Jesus said, “Why are you
thinking evil things in
your hearts? 5 Which is
easier, to say, ‘Yoʋr sins
are §forgiven,’ or to say,
‘Rise and walk’? 6 But so
that you may know that
the Son of Man has au-

paralytic—“Rise, pick up

went to his house. 8 When
the crowds saw it, they were
*amazed and glorified God,

Jesus Calls Matthew
* 9:1 the ¦ a ANT CT
Jesus went on from
there, he saw a man named
Matthew sitting at the tax
booth. Jesus said to him,
“Follow me,” so Matthew
rose and followed him.
10 Later, as Jesus reclined
at the table in Matthew's
house, behold, many tax
collectors and sinners came
and reclined with him and
his disciples. 11 When the
Pharisees saw this, they said
to his disciples, “Why is
your teacher †eating with
tax collectors and sinners?”
12 When Jesus heard this, he
said ‡to them, “It is not the
healthy who have need of
a physician, but the sick.
13 Go and learn what this
means: ‘I desire mercy
and not sacrifice,’ for I
did not come to call the
righteous, but sinners §to
repentance.”
A Question About Fasting
Then the disciples of
John came to Jesus and said,
“Why is it that we and the
Pharisees fast *often, but
yoʋr disciples do not fast?”
15 Jesus said to them, “Can
the bridegroom's atten-
dants mourn as long as
the bridegroom is with
them? But the days are
coming when the bride-

A Girl Restored to Life and
a Woman Healed
18 As he said these things
to them, behold, a ruler
came and bowed down be-
fore him, saying, “My daugh-
ter has just now died, but
come and lay yoʋr hand
on her, and she will live.”
19 So Jesus rose and followed
him, and so did his disciples.
20 And behold, a woman who
had suffered from a flow of
blood for twelve years came
up behind him and touched
the fringe of his garment.
21 For she said to herself,
“If only I touch his garment,
I will be healed.” 22 But
when Jesus turned †around
and saw her, he said, “Take
courage, daughter; yoʋr
faith has healed yoʋ.” And
the woman was healed from
that hour. 23 When Jesus
came to the house of the
ruler and saw the flute play-
ers and the crowd making
a commotion, 24 he said ‡to
them, “Go away, for the
girl is not dead but sleep-

Jesus went on

went into the house, the
blind men came to him,
and Jesus said to them, “Do
you believe that I am
able to do this?” They
said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
29 Then he touched their
eyes, saying, “Let it be done
for yoʋ according to your
faith.” 30 And their eyes
were opened. Then Jesus
sternly warned them, “See
that no one knows about
this.” 31 But they went out
and spread the news about
him throughout that entire
region.
Jesus Heals a Mute Man
As they were going
away, behold, a mute man
possessed by a demon was
brought to Jesus. 33 When
the demon was cast out, the
mute man spoke, and the
crowds were amazed, say-
ing, “Such a thing has never
been seen in Israel.” 34 But
the Pharisees said, “By the

1 When Jesus had finished
instructing his twelve disci-
ples, he departed from there
to teach and preach in their
cities.
Messengers from John the
Baptist
2 Now when John heard
in prison about the works
Christ had done, he sent
*two of his disciples 3 to ask
him, “Are yoʋ the one who is
to come, or should we wait
for another?” 4 Jesus an-
swered them, “Go tell John
what you hear and see:
5 The blind receive their
sight and the lame walk,
lepers are made clean and
the deaf hear, the dead
are raised and the poor
have good news preached
to them. 6 And blessed is
anyone who does not take
offense at me.”
7 As these men went away,
Jesus began to speak to the
crowds about John: “What
did you go out into the
wilderness to see?
A
reed shaken by the wind?
8 What then did you go out
to see? A man clothed
in soft garments? Behold,
those who wear soft gar-
ments are in the palacesTHE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 11:920THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 11:23
of kings. 9 But †what did
you go out to see?
A
prophet? Yes, I tell you,
and more than a prophet.
10 ‡For this is the one of
whom it is written,
‘Behold, I am sending my
messenger ahead of
yoʋ,
who will prepare yoʋr
way before yoʋ.’
Truly I say to you,
among those born of
women there has arisen
no one greater than John
the Baptist, but whoever
is least in the kingdom of
heaven is greater than he.
12 From the days of John
the Baptist until now the
kingdom of heaven has
been suffering violence,
and the violent take it
by force. 13 For all the
prophets and the law
prophesied until John.
14 And if you are willing
to accept it, he is Elijah
who is to come. 15 He who
has ears §to hear, let him
hear.
16 “But to what should I
compare this generation?
It is like *children sitting
in the †marketplaces and
calling out to their com-
panions,
11
17 ‘We played the flute for
you, but you did not
dance;
we sang a lament ‡for
you, but you did not
mourn.’
18 For
John came neither
eating nor drinking, and
they say, ‘He has a de-
mon.’ 19 The Son of Man
came eating and drinking,
and they say, ‘Behold, a
glutton and a drunkard,
a friend of tax collectors
and sinners!’
Yet wis-
dom is justified by her
§children.”
Woe to the Unrepentant
20 Then Jesus began to re-
proach the cities in which
most of his miracles had
been done, because they did
not repent: 21 “Woe to yoʋ,
Chorazin!
Woe to yoʋ,
Bethsaida! For if the mir-
acles that were done in
you had been done in Tyre
and Sidon, they would
have repented long *ago

22 But I tell you, it will

day of judgment for Tyre

Come to Me, and I Will
Give You Rest
25 At that time Jesus said,
“I praise yoʋ, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth,
because yoʋ have hidden
these things from the wise
and intelligent, and re-
vealed them to infants.
26 Yes, Father, for so it
was well-pleasing in yoʋr
sight. 27 All things have
been delivered to me by
my Father. No one knows
the Son except the Fa-
ther, and no one knows
the Father except the Son,
and anyone to whom the
Son chooses to reveal him.
28 Come to me, all of you
who labor and are bur-
dened, and I will give you
rest. 29 Take my yoke upon
you and learn from me,
for I am gentle and lowly
in heart, and you will find
rest for your souls. 30 For
my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light.”

them. 2 When the Pharisees
saw this, they said to him,
“Behold, yoʋr disciples are
doing what is not lawful to

said to them, “Have you

profane the Sabbath and
yet are guiltless? 6 But
I tell you that ‡something

known what this means:
‘I desire mercy and not
sacrifice,’ you would not
have condemned the guilt-
less. 8 For the Son of Man
is Lord §of the Sabbath.”
Jesus Heals a Man with a
Withered Hand
9 Then he departed from
there and went into their
synagogue. 10 And behold,
there was a *man who had
a withered hand. In order
to accuse Jesus, the Phar-
isees asked him, “Is it law-
ful to heal on the Sabbath?”
11 He said to them, “What

pit on the Sabbath will not

is lawful to do good on the

the man, “Stretch out yoʋr
hand.” So he stretched it
out, and it was restored, as
sound as the other. 14 But the
Pharisees went out and took
counsel against Jesus as to
how they might destroy him.
God's Chosen Servant
Aware of this, Je-
sus withdrew from there.
†Large crowds followed him,
and he healed them all
16 and warned them not to
make him known. 17 This
was to fulfill what had been
spoken through Isaiah the
prophet:
15
“Behold, my servant
whom I have chosen,
my beloved, in whom my
soul is well pleased.
I will put my Spirit upon
him,
and he will declare justice to
the Gentiles.
19 He will not quarrel, nor
will he cry out,
nor will anyone hear his
voice in the streets.
20 A bruised reed he will not
break,
and a smoldering wick he
will not extinguish,
until he brings justice to vic-
tory.
21 And in his name the Gen-
tiles will hope.”

Jesus and Beelzebul
22
Then
a
demon-
possessed man who was
blind and mute was brought
to him, and Jesus healed
him, so that the ‡man
who was blind and mute
could speak and see. 23 All
the crowds were amazed
and said, “Can this be the
24 But
§Son of David?”
when the Pharisees heard
this, they said, “It is only
by Beelzebul, the ruler of
demons, that this man casts
out demons.” 25 Knowing
their thoughts, Jesus said
to them, “Every kingdom
divided against itself is
laid waste, and no city
or house divided against
itself will stand. 26 So if
Satan casts out Satan, he
is divided against himself.
How then will his kingdom
stand? 27 And if I cast out
demons by Beelzebul, by
whom *do your followers
cast them out? Therefore
they will be your judges.

33 “Either make the tree
good and its fruit good,
or make the tree bad and
its fruit bad, for by its
fruit the tree is known.
34 You brood of vipers,
how can you speak good
things, when you are evil?

The Sign of Jonah
38 Then some of the scribes
and Pharisees †responded,
“Teacher, we want to see
a sign from yoʋ.” 39 But
Jesus answered them, “An
evil and adulterous gener-
ation asks for a sign, but
no sign will be given to it
except the sign of Jonah
the prophet. 40 For just
as ‡Jonah was in the belly
of the great sea creature

Jesus' Mother and Broth-
While Jesus was still
speaking to the crowds, be-
hold, his mother and his
brothers stood outside, ask-
ing to speak to him. 47 §Then
someone said to him, “Be-
hold, yoʋr mother and yoʋr
brothers are standing out-
side, asking to speak to yoʋ.”
48 But he replied to the one
who spoke to him, “Who
is my mother, and who
are my brothers?” 49 And
stretching out his hand to-
ward his disciples, he said,
“Behold, my mother and
my brothers! 50 For who-
ever does the will of my
Father in heaven is my
brother and sister and
mother.”

The Parable of the Sower
1 On that day Jesus went
out of the house and sat
by the sea, 2 and large
crowds gathered around
him. So he got into *the
boat and sat down, while the
entire crowd stood on the
shore. 3 Then he told them
many things in parables,
saying, “Behold, a sower
went out to sow. 4 As he
sowed, some seeds fell
along the path, and the
birds came and devoured
them. 5 Other seeds fell
on rocky ground, where
they did not have much
soil, and they sprang
up immediately because
they had no depth of
soil. 6 But when the sun
rose, they were scorched.
And because they had
no root, they withered
away. 7 Other seeds fell
among the thorns, and
the thorns grew up and
choked them. 8 But other
seeds fell on good soil and
produced fruit, some a
hundred, some sixty, and
some thirty times more
than what was sown. 9 He
who has ears †to hear, let
him hear.”
The Purpose of Parables
10 Then the disciples came
and said to him, “Why do
yoʋ speak to the people
in parables?” 11 Jesus an-
swered ‡them, “To you it
has been given to know
the mysteries of the king-
dom of heaven, but to
them it has not been

has will be given more,
and he will have an abun-
dance. But whoever does
not have, even what he
has will be taken away
from him. 13 That is why

I speak to them in para-
bles, §because ‘they see
but do not perceive, and
they hear but do not listen
or understand.’ 14 In them
is fulfilled the prophecy of
Isaiah, which says,
‘Yoʋ will hear but never
understand,
and you will see but never
perceive.
15 For the heart of this
people has become
dull;
with their ears they have
barely heard,
and their eyes they have
closed,
lest they should see with
their eyes,
hear with their ears,
and understand with their
heart and turn back,
and I would heal them.’
But blessed are your
eyes because they see, and
your ears because they
hear. 17 For truly I say to
you, many prophets and
righteous people desired
to see the things you see
but did not see them, and
to hear the things you
hear but did not hear
them.
16
anyone hears the word
of the kingdom and does
not understand it, the evil
one comes and *snatches
away what was sown in
his heart.
This is the
seed sown along the path.
20 The seed sown on rocky
ground is he who hears
the word and immediately
†receives it with joy. 21 Yet
he has no root in him-
self, but is only tempo-
rary.
When tribulation
or persecution arises on
account of the word, he
immediately falls away.
22 The seed sown among
the thorns is he who hears
the word, but the cares
of ‡this world and the de-
ceitfulness of riches choke
the word, and it becomes
unfruitful. 23 But the seed
sown on the good soil is
he who hears the word
and understands it, who
bears fruit and produces
a hundred, sixty, or thirty
times more than what was
sown.”
The Parable of the Wheat
and the Tares
24 Jesus presented another
parable to them, saying,
“The kingdom of heaven
may be compared to a
person who sowed good
seed in his field, 25 but

ing, his enemy came and

to them, ‘An enemy has

So the ser-
vants said to him, ‘Do yoʋ
want us to go and gather
them up?’ 29 He said, ‘No,
lest in gathering the tares
you uproot the wheat with
them. 30 Let them both
grow together until the
harvest, and at the time
of the harvest I will say to
the reapers, “Gather the
tares first and bind them
into bundles to burn them
up, but gather the wheat
into my barn.” ’ ”
The Parable of the Mus-
tard Seed
31 He presented another
parable to them, saying,
“The kingdom of heaven
is like a grain of mustard
seed that a man took and
sowed in his field, 32 which
is indeed smaller than all
the seeds, but when it is
grown, it is larger than
§the garden plants and be-
comes a tree, so that the
birds of the sky come and
nest in its branches.”
33 He
spoke to them an-
other parable: “The king-
dom of heaven is like
leaven that a woman took
and mixed into three mea-
sures of flour until it had
all been leavened.”

“I will open my mouth in

The Parable of the Wheat
and the Tares Explained
36 Then Jesus left the
crowds and went into ‡the
house, and his disciples
came to him and said,
“Explain to us the parable
of the tares of the field.”
37 He answered §them, “He
who sows the good seed
is the Son of Man. 38 The
field is the world, and
the good seeds are the
sons of the kingdom. The
tares are the sons of the
evil one, 39 and the enemy

devil.

The Pharisees and Sad-
ducees Ask For a Sign
1 Now the Pharisees and
Sadducees came and tested
Jesus, asking him to show
them a sign from heaven.
2 But he answered them,
“When evening comes
you say, ‘It will be fair
weather, for the sky is
red.’ 3 And in the morning
you say, ‘There will be
a storm today, for the
sky is red and threaten-
ing.’ *Hypocrites!

appearance of the sky,
but you cannot †discern

this
among
themselves,
saying, “He must have said

Jesus said *to them, “Why

you not yet understand?

they understood that he had
not told them to beware of
the leaven of bread, but of
the teaching of the Pharisees
and Sadducees.

to them, “But who do you

Peter answered, “Yoʋ are the
Christ, the Son of the liv-
ing God.” 17 And Jesus an-
swered him, “Blessed are
yoʋ, Simon Bar-Jonah, for
flesh and blood has not re-
vealed this to yoʋ, but my
Father in heaven. 18 And
I tell yoʋ that yoʋ are
Peter, and on this rock I
will build my church, and
the gates of Hades shall
not prevail against it. 19 I
will give yoʋ the keys of
the kingdom of heaven,
and whatever yoʋ bind
on earth will be bound
in heaven, and whatever
yoʋ loose on earth will be
loosed in heaven.” 20 Then
he *commanded †his disci-
ples to tell no one that he
was ‡Jesus the Christ.
“Get behind me, Satan!
Yoʋ are a stumbling block
to me, for yoʋ are not
thinking about the things
of God, but the things of
men.”
24 Then Jesus said to his
disciples, “If anyone wants
to come after me, he
must deny himself, take
up his cross, and follow
me. 25 For whoever wants
to save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life
for my sake will find it.
26 For what *does it benefit
a person if he gains the
whole world but forfeits
his soul? Or what can a
person give in exchange
for his soul? 27 For the
Son of Man will come with
his angels in the glory of
his Father, and then he
will repay each person ac-
cording to what he has
done. 28 Truly I say to you,
there are some standing
here who will certainly
not taste death until they
see the Son of Man coming
in his kingdom.”

When they came to

“Your teacher pays the two-

25 He said, “Yes.”

Jesus Predicts His Death
and Resurrection a Third
Time
17 As Jesus was ‡going
up to Jerusalem, he took
the twelve disciples aside
§privately on the way and
said to them, 18 “Behold, we
are going up to Jerusalem,
and the Son of Man will
be delivered up to the
chief priests and scribes.
They will condemn him
to death 19 and hand him
over to the Gentiles to
be mocked, flogged, and
crucified. But on the third
day he will *rise again.”
The Request of the Mother
of James and John
20 Then the mother of the
sons of Zebedee came with
her sons to Jesus, and bow-
ing down she asked him for
a favor. 21 So he said to her,
“What do yoʋ want?” She
said to him, “Say that these
two sons of mine may sit,
one on yoʋr right and one
on yoʋr left, in yoʋr king-
dom.” 22 Jesus answered,
“You do not know what

able to drink the cup that
I am about to †drink, or to
be baptized with the bap-
tism that I am baptized
with?” The two brothers
said to him, “We are able.”
23 So he said to them, “You
will indeed drink my ‡cup
and be baptized with the
baptism that I am bap-
tized with, but to sit on
my right and on my left
is not mine to give, but
it is for those for whom
it has been prepared by
my Father.” 24 When the
ten heard this, they were in-
dignant with the two broth-
ers. 25 So Jesus called them
over and said, “You know
that the rulers of the Gen-
tiles lord it over them,
and their great men exer-
cise authority over them.
26 But it §shall not be so
among you. Instead, who-
ever wants to be great
among you must be your
servant, 27 and whoever
wants to be first among
you must be your slave,
28 just as the Son of Man
came not to be served
but to serve, and to give
his life as a ransom for
many.”
Jesus Heals Two Blind
Men
29 As they went out from
Jericho, a large crowd fol-
lowed him. 30 And behold,
there were two blind men
sitting by the road. When
they heard that Jesus was
passing by, they cried out,
“*Have mercy on us, Lord,
Son of David!” 31 But the
crowd rebuked them, telling
them to be silent. Yet they
cried out even more loudly,
“†Have mercy on us, Lord,
Son of David!” 32 So Jesus
stopped, called them over,
and said, “What do you
want me to do for you?”
33 They said to him, “Lord,
let our eyes be opened.”
34 Moved with compassion,
Jesus touched their eyes, and
immediately ‡their eyes re-
ceived sight, and they fol-
lowed him.
21
The Triumphal Entry
they drew near
to Jerusalem and came to
*Bethsphage, at the Mount
of Olives, Jesus sent two dis-
ciples ahead, 2 telling them,
“Go into the village ahead
of you, and immediately
you will find a donkey

it. Untie them and bring

one says anything to you,
say, ‘The Lord has need of
them.’ And immediately
he will send them.” 4 Now
†all this took place to fulfill
what the Lord had spoken
through the prophet:
“Say to the daughter of
Zion,
‘Behold, yoʋr king is coming
to yoʋ,
humble and mounted on a
donkey,
and ‡a colt, the foal of a beast
of burden.’ ”
5
6 So the disciples went and
did just as Jesus had di-
rected them. 7 They brought
the donkey and the colt
and laid on them their gar-
ments, and §Jesus sat on
them. 8 A very large crowd
spread their garments on the
road, and others cut down
branches from the trees and
also spread them on the
road. 9 The crowds that went
ahead of him and those that
followed were crying out,
“Hosanna to the Son of
David!
Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord!
Hosanna in the highest!”
10 As
he came into
Jerusalem, the whole city
was stirred up, saying, “Who
is this?” 11 So the crowds
were saying, “This is *Jesus
the prophet, who is from
Nazareth of Galilee.”
Jesus Cleanses the Temple
12 Then Jesus entered the
†courts of God's temple and
drove out all who were sell-
ing and buying there. He
overturned the tables of the
money changers and the
seats of those who were sell-
ing doves. 13 And he said
to them, “It is written, ‘My
house shall be called a
house of prayer,’ but you
‡have made it a den of
robbers.”
14 Then the §lame and
the blind came to him in
the temple courts, and he
healed them. 15 But when
the chief priests and the
scribes saw the wonderful
things that he did and the
children crying out in the
temple courts, “Hosanna to
the Son of David,” they were
indignant 16 and said to him,
“Do yoʋ hear what these
children are saying?” Jesus
said to them, “Yes, have
you never read,
‘Out of the mouths of ba-

17 And leaving them, he went
out of the city to Bethany
and spent the night there.

18 Early
in the morning,
as Jesus was returning to
the city, he was hungry.
19 Seeing a lone fig tree
by the road, he came to
it and found nothing on it
but leaves. Then he said
to it, “May there never be
any fruit from yoʋ again.”
And at once the fig tree with-
ered. 20 When the disciples
saw it, they were amazed,
saying, “How did the fig tree
wither all at once?” 21 Jesus
answered them, “Truly I
say to you, if you have
faith and do not doubt,
not only will you do what
has been done to the fig
tree, but even if you say to
this mountain, ‘Be taken
up and thrown into the
sea,’ it will happen. 22 And
if you have faith, you will
receive whatever you ask
for in prayer.”

did John's authority to
baptize come from? From
heaven or from men?”
So they discussed it among
themselves, saying, “If we
say, ‘From heaven,’ he will
say to us, ‘Why then did you
not believe him?’ 26 But we
are afraid of what the crowd
might do if we say, ‘From
men,’ for everyone regards
John as a prophet.” 27 So
they answered Jesus, “We do
not know.” Then he said to
them, “Neither will I tell
you by what authority I
am doing these things.

The Parable of the Vine-
yard Owner
33 “Listen to another
parable: There was a mas-
ter of a house who planted
a vineyard, put a fence
around it, dug a winepress
in it, built a tower, leased
it to farmers, and left the
country. 34 When the sea-
son for fruit drew near,
he sent his servants to
the farmers to receive his
fruit. 35 But the farmers
took his servants; they
beat one, killed another,
and stoned yet another.
36 Again he sent other ser-
vants, more than the first.
But the farmers treated
them in the same way.
37 Last of all, he sent them
his son, saying, ‘They will
have respect for my son.’
38 But when the farmers
saw the son, they said
among themselves, ‘This
is the heir. Come, let us
kill him and take posses-
sion of his inheritance.’
39 So they took him, threw
him out of the vineyard,
and killed him. 40 Now
when the owner of the
vineyard comes, what will
he do to those farmers?”
41 They said to him, “He will
bring those wretches to a
wretched end and lease the
vineyard to other farmers
who will give him the fruits
in their seasons.”
42 Jesus said to them,
“Have you never read in

on whom it falls will be
crushed.”
45 When the chief priests
and the Pharisees heard Je-
sus' parables, they knew he
was speaking about them.
46 Although they were look-
ing for a way to arrest
him, they were afraid of the
crowds, because the people
regarded him as a prophet.

The Parable of the Wed-
ding Feast
1 Once again Jesus spoke
to them in parables, saying,
2 “The kingdom of heaven
can be compared to a king
who prepared a wedding
feast for his son. 3 He
sent his servants to call

vited to the wedding feast,THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 22:445THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 22:22

hate one another. 11 Many
false prophets will rise
up and lead many astray.
12 Because lawlessness will
be increased, the love of
many will grow cold, 13 but
he who endures to the
end will be saved. 14 And
this gospel of the kingdom
will be proclaimed in the
whole world as a testi-
mony to all nations, and
then the end will come.
The Great Tribulation
“So when you see
the abomination of des-
olation, which was spo-
ken of by Daniel the
prophet, standing in the
holy place” (let the reader
understand), 16 “then those
who are in Judea must flee
to the mountains. 17 He
who is on the housetop
must not come down to
get anything out of his
house. 18 And he who is
in the field must not turn
back to get his *garments.
19 Woe to those who are
with child and to those
who are nursing infants

that your flight will not

that time there will be
a great tribulation unlike
any other from the be-
ginning of the world un-
til now, and it will never
be equaled again. 22 If
those days had not been
cut short, no flesh would
be saved.
But for the
sake of the chosen those
days will be cut short.
23 If anyone says to you at
that time, ‘Behold, here is
the Christ!’ or, ‘Here he
is!’ do not believe him.
24 For false christs and
false prophets will rise up
and perform great signs
and wonders so †as to lead
astray, if possible, even
the chosen. 25 Behold, I
have told you in advance.

The Plot to Kill Jesus
1 When Jesus had finished
saying *all these things, he
said to his disciples, 2 “You
know that after two days
the Passover is coming,
and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be cruci-
fied.”
3 Then the chief †priests,
the scribes, and the elders
of the people were gathered
together in the courtyard of
the high priest, whose name
was Caiaphas, 4 and they
plotted together to arrest Je-
sus by stealth and kill him.
5 But they said, “Not during
the feast, lest there be a riot
among the people.”

is preached in the whole
world, what this woman
has done will also be spo-
ken of as a memorial to
her.”
Judas Agrees to Betray Je-
sus
14 Then one of the twelve,
the one called Judas Iscar-
iot, went to the chief priests
15 and said, “What are you
willing to give me if I deliver
him up to you?” So they
set out for him thirty pieces
of silver. 16 And from then
on he was looking for an
opportunity to betray Jesus.

20 When evening came, Je-
sus was reclining at the table
with the †twelve. 21 As they
were eating, he said, “Truly
I say to you, one of you
will betray me.” 22 Greatly
distressed, they began to say
to him one after another,
“Surely not I, Lord?” 23 Jesus
answered, “The one who
has dipped his hand with
me in the dish will betray
me. 24 The Son of Man
indeed goes just as it is
written of him, but woe
to that man by whom the
Son of Man is betrayed!
It would have been better
for that man if he had not

who betrayed him, replied,

singing a hymn, they went

31 Then Jesus said to them,
“All of you will fall away
because of me this night.
For it is written, ‘I will
strike the shepherd, and
the sheep of the flock will
be scattered.’ 32 But af-
ter I have been raised
up, I will go ahead of

answered him, “Even if ev-

yoʋ that on this night,

yoʋ will deny me three
times.” 35 But Peter said to
him, “Even if I must die with
yoʋ, I will certainly not deny
yoʋ.” And all the disciples
said the same thing.
The Institution of the
Lord's Supper
26 As they were eating,
Jesus took ‡the bread, and

disciples, and said, “Take

farther, he fell on his face
and prayed, “My Father, if
possible, let this cup pass
from me; nevertheless,
not as I will, but as yoʋ
will.” 40 Then he came to
the disciples and found them
sleeping, and said to Peter,
“So you could not keep
watch with me for one
hour? 41 Keep watch and
pray, lest you enter into
temptation.
The spirit
indeed is willing, but the
flesh is weak.” 42 Again,
he went away for a second
time and prayed, “My Fa-

*and found them sleeping

Jesus Arrested
47 While he was still speak-
ing, behold, Judas, one of
the twelve, came.
With
him was a large crowd with
swords and clubs, sent from
the chief priests and elders
of the people. 48 Now his
betrayer had given them a

said to him, “Friend, †for

forward, took hold of Jesus,
and arrested him. 51 And
behold, one of the men with
Jesus stretched out his hand
and drew his sword. He
struck the servant of the
high priest and cut off his
ear. 52 Then Jesus said to
him, “Put yoʋr sword back
into its place, for all who
take the sword will ‡die by
the sword. 53 Or do yoʋ
think that I cannot call on

to the crowds, “Have you
come out to arrest me
with swords and clubs as
you would against a rob-
ber? I sat daily *with you,
teaching in the temple
courts, and you did not
arrest me. 56 But all this
has taken place so that the

would be fulfilled.” Then
all the disciples left him and
fled.
Jesus Faces the Sanhedrin
57 Now those who had ar-
answer?
What are these
men testifying against yoʋ?”
63 But Jesus was silent. Then
the high priest said to him, “I
adjure yoʋ by the living God
to tell us if yoʋ are the Christ,
the Son of God.” 64 Jesus
said to him, “Yoʋ have
said it yoʋrself. Never-
theless I say to you, from
now on you will see the
Son of Man sitting at the
right hand of Power and
coming on the clouds of
heaven.” 65 Then the high
priest tore his garments and
said, “He has blasphemed!
What further need do we
have of witnesses? Behold,
you have now heard *his

think?” They answered, “He

rested Jesus led him away
to Caiaphas the high priest,
where the scribes and the el-
ders were assembled. 58 But
Peter was following him at
a distance, coming as far as
the courtyard of the high
priest. After going inside,
he sat with the officers to
see the outcome. 59 Now
the chief †priests, the el-
ders, and the whole San-
hedrin were seeking false
testimony against Jesus, so

72 But again he denied it
with an oath: “I do not
know the man.” 73 After a
little while, those who were
standing there came up and
said to Peter, “Truly yoʋ also
are one of them, for even
yoʋr accent gives yoʋ away.”
74 Then he began to invoke
curses and to swear: “I do
not know the man.” And im-
mediately a rooster crowed.
75 Then Peter remembered
what Jesus had said ‡to him:
“Before a rooster crows,
yoʋ will deny me three
times.” And he went out
and wept bitterly.

Jesus Handed Over to Pon-
tius Pilate
1 Now
when morning
came, all the chief priests
and the elders *of the
people took counsel against
Jesus to put him to death.
2 They bound him, led him
away, and handed him
over to †Pontius Pilate, the
governor.
5 So he threw the pieces of
silver into the temple and
departed.
Then he went
away and hanged himself.
6 The chief priests took the
pieces of silver and said, “It
is not lawful to put them
into the temple treasury,
since they are a price paid
7 So they
for blood.”
took counsel and used the
money to buy the potter's
field as a burial place for
foreigners. 8 Therefore that
field has been called the
Field of Blood to this day.
9 Then what was spoken by
Jeremiah the prophet was
fulfilled: “They took the
thirty pieces of silver, the
price of him on whom a
price had been set, on whom
some of the sons of Israel
had set a price, 10 and they
gave them for the potter's
field, as the Lord directed
me.”

11 Meanwhile, Jesus stood
before the governor, and the
governor asked him, “Are

24 When Pilate saw that he
was achieving nothing and
that a riot was breaking out,
he took water and washed
his hands before the crowd,
saying, “I am innocent of
the blood of this §righteous
man. See to it yourselves.”
25 All the people answered,
“His blood be on us and on
our children!” 26 Then he
released for them Barabbas,
but he scourged Jesus and
handed him over to be cru-
cified.

governor was accustomed

him to carry Jesus' cross.

who were crucified with him
were also reviling him in the
same way.
The Death of Jesus
From the sixth hour
until the ninth hour, there
was darkness over the whole
46 And about the
land.
ninth hour Jesus cried out
with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli,
§lima sabachthani?” that
is, “My God, my God, why
have yoʋ forsaken me?”
47 When some of those stand-
ing there heard this, they
said, “This man is calling for
Elijah.” 48 Immediately one
of them ran, got a sponge,
filled it with sour wine, put
it on a reed, and gave it to
him to drink. 49 But the
rest said, “Leave him alone.
Let us see if Elijah comes
to save *him.” 50 Then Je-
sus cried out again with a
loud voice and gave up his
spirit. 51 And behold, the
veil of the temple was torn
in two from top to bottom.
The earth was shaken, and
the rocks were split. 52 The
tombs were opened, and

shaking their heads 40 and
saying, “Yoʋ who would de-
stroy the temple and build it

41 In the same way the chief

isees, were mocking him,
saying, 42 “He saved others,

said, “Truly this man was

55 Many women who had
followed Jesus from Galilee
and provided for him †were
there looking on from a dis-
tance, 56 among whom were
Mary Magdalene, Mary the
mother of James and ‡Joses,
and the mother of the sons
of Zebedee.
The Burial of Jesus
it was evening,
there came a rich man from
Arimathea named Joseph,
who was himself also a dis-
ciple of Jesus. 58 He went
to Pilate and asked for Jesus'
body. So Pilate commanded
that the body be given to
him. 59 Joseph took the body,
wrapped it in a clean linen
cloth, 60 and laid it in his own
new tomb, which he had
hewn in the rock. Then he
rolled a large stone against
the entrance of the tomb

Magdalene was there, and so
was the other Mary, sitting
across from the tomb.

next day (that is,
after the day of Prepara-

the Pharisees gathered to-

said, “Sir, we remember
that while he was still alive
that deceiver said, ‘After
three days I will rise again.’
64 Therefore command that
the tomb be secured until
the third day, lest §his dis-
ciples come *by night, steal
him away, and say to the
people, ‘He has been raised
from the dead.’ This last
deception would be worse
than the first.” 65 Pilate said
to them, “You have a guard
of soldiers. Go and make
it as secure as you know
how.” 66 So they went and
secured the tomb by sealing
the stone and posting the
guard of soldiers.

The Resurrection
After the Sabbath, at
dawn on the first day of
the week, Mary Magdalene
came to see the tomb along
with the other Mary. 2 And
behold, there was a great
earthquake, for an angel of
the Lord descended from
heaven and came and rolled
away the stone *from the
entrance and sat on it. 3 His
appearance was like light-
ning, and his clothing was as
white as snow. 4 The guards
were so afraid of him that

they trembled and became
like dead men. 5 Then the
angel said to the women,
“Do not be afraid, for I know
that you are looking for Je-
sus, who has been cruci-
fied. 6 He is not here, for
he is risen, just as he said.
Come see the place where
†the Lord lay. 7 And now go
quickly and tell his disciples
that he is risen from the
dead. And behold, he is go-
ing ahead of you to Galilee;
there you will see him. Lis-
ten to what I have told you.”
8 So they went ‡out quickly
from the tomb with fear and
great joy, and ran to tell his
disciples. 9 §As they went
to tell his disciples, behold,
Jesus met them and said,
“Greetings!” So they came
up, took hold of his feet, and
worshiped him. 10 Then Je-
sus said to them, “Do not be
afraid; go tell my brothers
to go to Galilee, and there
they will see me.”
The Soldiers Bribed to Lie
they went, behold,
some of the guards went into
the city and brought word to
the chief priests of all that
had taken place. 12 After the
chief priests had assembled
with the elders and taken
counsel, they gave a large
sum of money to the soldiers
13 and said, “Tell people, ‘His

the money and did as they
had been instructed. And
this story is still being spread
among the Jews today.

the eleven
disciples went to Galilee, to
the mountain where Jesus
had directed them to go.
17 When they saw him, they
worshiped him, but some
doubted. 18 Then Jesus came
and said to them, “All au-
thority in heaven and on
earth has been given to
me. 19 *Go and make dis-
ciples of all nations, bap-

The Baptism of Jesus
9 In those days Jesus came
from Nazareth of Galilee and
was baptized by John in the
Jordan. 10 Immediately as
he was coming up †from
the water, he saw the heav-
ens being split apart and
the Spirit descending on him
like a dove. 11 Then a voice
came from heaven: “Yoʋ are
my beloved ‡Son, in whom I
am well pleased.”
The Temptation of Jesus

drove him out into the

§there in the wilderness for
forty days, being tempted by

Jesus Calls His First Disci-
ples
16 As Jesus was †walking
by the Sea of Galilee, he
saw Simon and Andrew ‡his
brother (that is, Simon's
brother) casting a net in the
sea, for they were fisher-
men. 17 Jesus said to them,
“Follow me, and I will
make you become fish-
ers of men.” 18 So they
immediately left their nets
and followed him. 19 Going
on a little farther §from

synagogue there was a man
who was possessed by an
unclean spirit. He cried out,
24 “§Leave us alone! What
do yoʋ have to do with us,
Jesus of Nazareth?
Have
yoʋ come to destroy us?
I know who yoʋ are—the
Holy One of God.” 25 But
Jesus rebuked him, saying,
“Be silent, and come out
of him!” 26 So the unclean
spirit convulsed the man
and came out of him, crying
out with a loud voice. 27 All
the people were amazed so
that they questioned *among
themselves, saying, “What

leaving the syn-

went to the house of Simon

32 When evening came, af-
ter the sun had set, they
brought to Jesus all who
were sick and those who
were possessed by demons.
33 The whole city was gath-
ered together at the door,
34 and he healed many who
were sick with various dis-
eases. He also cast out many
demons, but he would not
allow the demons to speak,
because they knew *who he
was.
Jesus Cleanses a Man with
Leprosy
40 Then a leper came
up and §knelt before him,
begging him, “If yoʋ are
willing, yoʋ can make me

compassion, Jesus stretched
out his hand, touched the
man, and said to him, “I am
willing; be made clean.”
42 †When
he said this,
the leprosy immediately
departed from the man,
and he was made clean.
43 Then Jesus sternly warned
him and immediately sent
him away, 44 saying to him,
“See that yoʋ say nothing
to anyone, but go show
yoʋrself to the priest and
offer for yoʋr cleansing
what Moses commanded,
as a testimony to them.”
45 But the man went out and
began to proclaim it widely
and to spread the news, so
that Jesus could no longer
openly enter a town, but was
out in desolate places. Yet
people were coming to him
from everywhere.
Jesus Preaches in Galilee
Early the next morn-
ing, while it was still very
dark, Jesus rose and de-
parted. He went off to a des-
olate place and prayed there.
36 Simon and his compan-
ions searched diligently for
him, 37 and when they found
him, they said to him, “Ev-
eryone is looking for yoʋ.”
38 Jesus said to them, “Let

was at home. 2 †Immediately
many were gathered to-
gether, so that there was
no longer any room, not
even at the door, and he was
speaking the word to them.
3 Then some people came
to him, bringing a paralytic
carried by four men. 4 Since
they were not able to ‡come
near Jesus because of the
crowd, they uncovered the
roof where he was. After
digging through it, they let
down the mat on which the
paralytic was lying. 5 When
Jesus saw their faith, he said
to the paralytic, “Son, yoʋr
sins are forgiven §yoʋ.”
6 Now some of the scribes
were sitting there and
questioning in their hearts:
7 “Why does this man *speak
such blasphemies? Who can
forgive sins but God alone?”
8 Immediately Jesus knew
in his spirit that they were
discussing these questions
among themselves, so he
said to them, “Why are you
questioning these things
in your hearts? 9 Which
is easier, to say to the
paralytic, ‘Yoʋr sins are
†forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise,
take up yoʋr mat, and
walk’? 10 But so that you
may know that the Son
of Man has authority on
earth to forgive sins”—
he said to the paralytic—
11 “I say to yoʋ, rise, pick
up yoʋr mat, and go to
yoʋr house.” 12 So the man
‡immediately rose, picked
up his mat, and went out in
front of them all, so that they
were all amazed and began
glorifying God, saying, “We
have never seen anything
like this!”
Jesus Calls Levi
again Jesus went
out by the sea. The entire
crowd came to him, and he
taught them. 14 As he was
walking along, he saw Levi
the son of Alphaeus sitting at
the tax booth. Jesus said to
him, “Follow me,” so Levi
rose and followed him.
15 Later, as Jesus was re-
clining at the table in Levi's
house, many tax collectors
and sinners reclined with
him and his disciples, for
there were many who fol-

this, he said to them, “It is

A Question About Fasting
Now the disciples of
John and §the disciples of
the Pharisees were fasting.
So some people came and
said to Jesus, “Why is it
that the disciples of John
and the disciples of the Phar-
isees fast, but yoʋr disciples
do not fast?” 19 Jesus said
to them, “Can the bride-
groom's attendants fast
while the bridegroom is
with them? As long as
they have the bridegroom
with them they cannot
fast. 20 But the days are
coming when the bride-
groom will be taken away
from them, and then they
will fast in *those days.
21 “No one sews a piece
of unshrunk cloth on an
old garment. For †the gar-
ment's new patch would
pull away from the old
cloth, and a worse tear
would be made. 22 And
no one puts new wine into
old wineskins.
For the
‡new wine would burst the
wineskins; the wine would
be §spilled, and the wine-
skins would be ruined.
But new wine *must be put
into new wineskins.”
18
23 On
the Sabbath Jesus
was going through the
grainfields, and his disciples
began to make their way,
plucking heads of grain.
24 So the Pharisees said to
him, “Behold, why are they
doing what is not lawful to
do on the Sabbath?” 25 He
said to them, “Have you
never read what David
did when he had need and
was hungry, he and those
who were with him, 26 how
he entered the house
of God, in the time of
Abiathar the high priest,
and ate the bread of the
Presence, which is not
lawful for anyone to eat
except for the priests,
and how he also gave it
to those who were with
him?” 27 Then he said to
them, “The Sabbath was
made for man, not man
for the Sabbath. 28 So the
Son of Man is Lord even
of the Sabbath.”

Jesus Heals a Man with a
Withered Hand
1 Once again Jesus went
into *the synagogue, and a
man was there who had a
withered hand. 2 Now the
Pharisees were watching Je-
sus closely to see if he would
heal the man on the Sab-
bath, so that they could ac-

hand, “Rise and come for-

to them, “Is it lawful on
the Sabbath to do good
or to do evil, to save
life or to kill?” But they
were silent. 5 After looking
around at them with anger,
grieved by the hardness of
their hearts, he said to the
man, “Stretch out yoʋr
hand.”
So he stretched
it out, and his hand was
†restored, as sound as the
other. 6 Then the Pharisees
went out and immediately
took counsel with the Hero-
dians against Jesus as to how
they might destroy him.
A Great Multitude Follows
Jesus
7 But Jesus withdrew with
his disciples to the sea, and a
great multitude from Galilee
followed ‡him, and also from
Judea, 8 from Jerusalem,
from Idumea, and from be-
yond the Jordan. A great
multitude of people from
around Tyre and Sidon also
came to him when they
heard about everything he
was doing. 9 Then he told
his disciples to have a small
boat ready for him, so that
the crowd would not crush
him. 10 For he had healed
many, so that all who had
afflictions were pressing to-
ward him to touch him.
11 Whenever the unclean
spirits saw him, they would
fall down before him and
cry out, “Yoʋ are the Son
of God.” 12 But he would
strictly warn them not to
make him known.
The Twelve Apostles
13 Afterward Jesus went up
on the mountain and called
for those whom he wanted,
and they came to him.
14 He appointed §twelve so
that they might be with
him and so that he might
send them out to preach
15 and to have authority to
*heal diseases and cast out
demons. 16 He †appointed
Simon (whom he gave the
name Peter); 17 James the
son of Zebedee and John the
brother of James (whom he
gave the name Boanerges,
which means,
Sons of
Thunder); 18 Andrew, Philip,
Bartholomew,
Matthew,
Thomas, James the son of
Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon
the ‡Cananite, 19 and Judas
Iscariot, who betrayed him.
Jesus and Beelzebul
Then §they entered a
house, 20 and *a crowd came
together again, so that Jesus
and his disciples could not
even eat bread. 21 When
his family heard about it,
they went out to restrain
him, for they said, “He is
out of his mind.” 22 But

down from Jerusalem said,
“He has Beelzebul,” and,
“By the ruler of demons he
casts out demons.” 23 So
Jesus called them over and
said to them in parables,
“How can Satan cast out

divided against itself, that

25 And if a house is divided

Then he can plunder his

ever blasphemies they ut-
ter. 29 But whoever blas-
phemes against the Holy
Spirit never has forgive-

said this because they were
saying, “He has an unclean
spirit.”
standing outside, they sent
word to him and called for
him. 32 There was a crowd
sitting around Jesus, and
they said to him, “Behold,
yoʋr †mother, yoʋr brothers,
and yoʋr sisters are outside
33 But
looking for yoʋ.”
he answered them, “Who
is my mother, ‡or my

around in a circle at the
people sitting there, he said,
“Behold, these are my
mother and my brothers!
35 §For
whoever does
the will of God is my
brother and *my sister

The Parable of the Sower

to teach by the sea, and a
*large crowd was gathered
around him. So he got into
†the boat and sat in it on the

was beside the sea on the

who has ears to hear, let
him hear.”
The Purpose of Parables
When he was alone,
those who were around him,
along with the twelve, asked
him about the §parable.
11 So he said to them, “To
you *it has been given
to know the mystery of
the kingdom of God, but
to those who are outside
everything is said in
parables, 12 so that
10
lest they should turn back
and †their sins be
forgiven them.’ ”
The Parable of the Sower
Explained
13 Then he said to them,
“Do you not understand
this parable? How then
will you understand all
the other parables? 14 The
sower sows the word.
15 Now some people are
like the seed along the
path, where the word
is sown.
When they
hear, Satan immediately
comes and takes away
the word that is sown in
‡their hearts. 16 §Likewise,
some people are like

with them in the boat, just
as he was.
Other †little
boats were also with him.
37 Now a great windstorm
arose, and the waves were
beating against the boat, so
that ‡it was nearly swamped.
38 But Jesus was in the stern,
asleep on a cushion.
So
they woke him up and said
to him, “Teacher, do yoʋ
not care that we are perish-
ing?” 39 Then he woke up
and rebuked the wind and
said to the sea, “Peace! Be
still!” So the wind ceased,
and there was a great calm.
40 Then he said to them,
“Why are you §so afraid?
*How is it that you have
no faith?” 41 And they were
filled with great fear and
said to one another, “Who
then is this, that even the
wind and the sea obey him?”

Jesus Heals a Demon-
Possessed Man
1 Then they came to the
other side of the sea, to the
region of the *Gadarenes.
2 As Jesus got out of the
boat, he was immediately
met by a man from the
tombs who had an unclean

among the tombs, and no
one could bind †him, not
even with chains. 4 For he
had often been bound with
shackles and chains, but he
tore the chains apart and
broke the shackles in pieces.
No one was strong enough
to subdue him. 5 Night and
day, ‡on the mountains and
among the tombs, he would
continually cry out and cut
himself with stones.
6 When he saw Jesus
from a distance, he ran
and bowed down before
him. 7 Then he cried out
with a loud voice and said,
“What do yoʋ have to do
with me, Jesus, Son of the
Most High God? I adjure
yoʋ by God, do not torment
me.” 8 For Jesus had said
to him, “Come out of the
man, yoʋ unclean spirit!”
9 Then Jesus asked him,
“What is yoʋr name?” He
§answered, “My name is
Legion, for we are many.”
10 And he earnestly begged
Jesus not to send them out
of that region.
11 Now there was a large
herd of pigs feeding there
near the *mountain. 12 †All
the demons begged Jesus,
“Send us into the pigs, so
that we may go into them.”
13 So he ‡immediately gave
them permission, and the
unclean spirits came out and
went into the pigs. Then the

herd, about two thousand in
number, rushed down the
steep bank into the sea, and
were drowned in the sea.
14 Those who had been
feeding the pigs then ran
off and reported it in the
city and in the country-
side. So the people went
out to see what had hap-
pened. 15 They came to Jesus
and saw the man who had
been possessed by demons
sitting there, clothed and
in his right mind—the man
who had been possessed
by the “Legion”—and they
were afraid. 16 Those who
had seen it told them what
had happened to the man
who had been possessed by
demons, and they also told
them about the pigs. 17 Then
the people began begging Je-
sus to depart from their re-
gion. 18 When Jesus got into
the boat, the man who had
been possessed by demons
begged to go with him. 19 But
Jesus did not permit him to
do so. Instead, he said to
him, “Go to yoʋr house
and to yoʋr people, and
report to them all that the
Lord has done for yoʋ and
how he has had mercy on
yoʋ.” 20 So the man went
away and began to proclaim
in the Decapolis all that Jesus
had done for him, and all the
people were amazed.
A Girl Restored to Life and
a Woman Healed
21 When
Jesus had again
crossed over in the boat to
the other side of the sea,
a large crowd was gathered
around him, and he was by
22 §And behold,
the sea.
one of the rulers of the syn-
agogue came, whose name
was Jairus. When he saw
Jesus, he fell down at his feet
23 and begged him earnestly,
“My little daughter is at the
point of death. Please come
and lay yoʋr hands on her
so that she may be *healed,
and she will live.” 24 So
Jesus went with him, and
a large crowd followed him
and pressed in on him.
25 Now there was a woman
who had suffered from a
flow of blood for twelve
years. 26 She had suffered
a great deal under many
physicians and had spent all
she had, yet received no ben-
efit from it, but had only
grown worse. 27 When she
heard about Jesus, she came
up behind him in the crowd
and touched his garment.
28 For she †said, “If I touch
even his garments, I will
be healed.” 29 Immediately
her flow of blood was dried
up, and she knew in her
body that she had been
healed from her affliction.
30 Jesus immediately per-
ceived in himself that power
had gone out from him, so he
turned around in the crowd
and said, “Who touched my
31 His disci-
garments?”
§ 5:22 And behold, ¦ Then ANT CT * 5:23 healed, and she will live ¦ healed

† 5:28 said ¦ said to herself ANTTHE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK 5:32 75 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK 6:4
ples said to him, “Yoʋ see
the crowd pressing in on
yoʋ, and yet yoʋ say, ‘Who
touched me?’ ” 32 But he
kept looking around to see
who had done it. 33 Now the
woman was frightened and
trembling, knowing what
had happened to her, so she
came and fell down before
him and told him the whole
truth. 34 Then Jesus said to
her, “Daughter, yoʋr faith
has healed yoʋ.
Go in
peace, and be healed of
yoʋr affliction.”
35 While he was still
speaking,
some
people
came from the ruler of the
synagogue's house and said,
“Yoʋr daughter has died;
why trouble the teacher
any further?” 36 But when
Jesus ‡heard what they said,
he immediately said to the
ruler of the synagogue,
“Do not be afraid; only
believe.” 37 From that point
he did not allow anyone
to accompany him except
Peter, James, and John the
brother of James. 38 When
§he came to the ruler of
the synagogue's house, he
saw a commotion, people
weeping and wailing loudly.
39 Then he went in and said
to them, “Why are you
making a commotion and
weeping? The child is not
dead but sleeping.” 40 And
they began laughing at him.
But he put them all outside,
took the child's father and
mother and those who were
with him, and went in to
where the child was *lying
down. 41 Then he took hold
of the child's hand and said
to her, “Talitha †koumi,”
which means, “Little girl,
I say to yoʋ, arise.”
42 Immediately the girl got
up and began to walk (for
she was twelve years old),
and they were ‡overcome
with
great
amazement.
43 Then he gave them strict
orders not to let anyone
know about this, and he told
them to give her something
to eat.
6
Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
1 Then Jesus left that place
and went to his hometown,
and his disciples followed
him. 2 When the Sabbath
came, he began to teach in
the synagogue, and many
who heard him were aston-
ished, saying, “Where did
this man get these things?
And what is this wisdom that
has been given to him, *that
such miracles are done by
his hands? 3 Is this not the
carpenter, the son of Mary,
and the brother of James,
Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are
not his sisters here with us?”
And they took offense at
him. 4 Then Jesus said to

them, “A prophet is not
without honor except in
his hometown, among his
relatives, and in his own
household.” 5 So he could
do no miracle there, except
that he laid his hands on a
few sick people and healed
them. 6 And he was amazed
at their unbelief.
Jesus Sends Out the
Twelve Apostles
Then Jesus went around
among the villages teaching.
7 He summoned the twelve
and began to send them out
two by two, giving them au-
thority over unclean spirits.
8 He instructed them to take
nothing for their journey ex-
cept a staff—no †knapsack,
no bread, and no copper
money in their belts. 9 He
told them to wear sandals
but not an extra tunic. 10 He
also said to them, “When-
ever you enter a house,
stay there until you leave
that place. 11 If ‡anyone
will not receive you or lis-
ten to you, shake the dust
off your feet as you leave
that place, as a testimony
against them. §Truly I say
to you, it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrah on the day of
judgment than for that
city.” 12 So they went out
and preached that people
should repent. 13 They also
cast out many demons and
anointed with oil many who
were sick and healed them.
The Death of John the Bap-
tist
14 Now King Herod heard
about this, for Jesus' name
had become known, and *he
said, “John the Baptist has
been raised from the dead,
and that is why these mighty
powers are at work in him.”
15 Others said, “He is Eli-
jah.” And others said, “He
is a prophet, †like one of
the prophets.” 16 But when
Herod heard this, he said,
“‡This is John, whom I be-
headed; he has been raised
§from the dead.”
17 For Herod himself had
sent men to arrest John
and chain him in prison
on account of Herodias, his
brother Philip's wife, whom
Herod had married. 18 For
John had been saying to
Herod, “It is not lawful for
yoʋ to have yoʋr brother's
wife.” 19 So Herodias held
a grudge against John and
wanted to kill him, but she
was not able to do so. 20 For
Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a righteous and
holy man, and he protected
him. When Herod listened
to John, he would listen to

21 But
an opportune day
came.
On his birthday
Herod prepared a banquet
for his nobles, military com-
manders, and the prominent
men of Galilee. 22 When †the
daughter of Herodias came
in and danced, she pleased
Herod and his guests. So
the king said to the girl,
“Ask me for whatever yoʋ
wish, and I will give it to
yoʋ.” 23 He ‡swore to her,
“Whatever yoʋ ask me, I
will give to yoʋ, up to half
of my kingdom.” 24 So she
went out and said to her
mother, “What should I ask
for?” Her mother said, “The
head of John the Baptist.”
25 Immediately the girl came
in with haste to the king and
made her request, saying, “I
want yoʋ to give me at once
the head of John the Baptist
on a platter.” 26 Although
the king was very sad, be-
cause of his oaths and his
guests, he did not want to
reject her. 27 So the king
immediately sent an execu-
tioner and commanded that
John's head be brought back.
28 The executioner then went
and beheaded John in the
prison, brought his head on
a platter, and gave it to the
girl. And the girl gave it to
her mother. 29 When John's
disciples heard about it, they
came and took his body and
laid it in a tomb.
The Feeding of the Five
Thousand
30 Meanwhile, the apostles
gathered around Jesus and
told him about all they had
done and taught. 31 Then he
said to them, “Come away
by yourselves to a deso-
late place and rest for a
little while.” For many peo-
ple were coming and going,
and Jesus and his apostles
did not even have an oppor-
tunity to eat. 32 So they went
away to a desolate place
in §the boat by themselves.
33 Now *many saw them
going away and recognized
†Jesus.
They ran together
on foot from all the ‡towns,
got there ahead of them,
and gathered around him.
34 When Jesus went ashore
and saw a large crowd, he
was moved with compassion
for them, because they were
like sheep without a shep-
herd. So he began to teach
them many things.
35 When the hour was al-
ready quite late, his disciples
came to him and said, “This
place is desolate, and the

the people away so that they
may go into the surrounding
countryside and villages and
buy themselves §bread, for
they have nothing to eat.”
37 But Jesus answered them,
“You give them something
to eat.” They said to him,
“Are we to go and buy two

bread and give it to them

them, “How many loaves
do you have? Go and see.”
When they found out, they
said, “Five, and two fish.”
39 Then he directed them
to have all the people sit
down in groups on the green
grass. 40 So they sat down
in groups of hundreds and
fifties. 41 Then he took the
five loaves and the two fish,
and looking up to heaven, he
blessed the food. He broke
the loaves and gave them to
*his disciples to set before
the people, and he divided
the two fish among them
all. 42 They all ate and were
filled, 43 and the disciples
picked up twelve baskets full
of the broken pieces and of
the fish. 44 Now those who
had eaten the loaves were

of him to the other side of
the sea, to Bethsaida, while
he sent the crowd away.
46 After taking leave of them,
he went to the mountain
to pray. 47 When evening
came, the boat was in the
middle of the sea, and he
was alone on the land. 48 ‡He
saw the disciples straining
as they rowed, for the wind
was against them. About
the fourth watch of the night
he came to them, walking
on the sea, and intended
49 But
to pass them by.
when they saw him walking
on the sea, they thought it

31 Then Jesus came back
from the region of Tyre

the Sea of Galilee, within
the region of the Decapolis.
32 Some people brought to
him a deaf man who had
a speech impediment, and
they begged him to lay his

took him aside privately,
away from the crowd. Then
he put his fingers into the
man's ears, spit, and touched
the man's tongue. 34 And
looking up to heaven, he
sighed and said to him,
“Ephphatha” (that is, “Be
opened”). 35 *Immediately
the man's ears were opened,
the impediment of his
tongue was removed, and
he began speaking clearly.

27 Then Jesus went on
to the villages of Caesarea
Philippi along with his disci-
ples. On the way he asked
his disciples, “Who do peo-

§answered, “Some say John

be rejected by the elders,
the chief priests, and the
scribes, and that he must be
killed and after three days
rise again. 32 He was stating
the matter plainly, so Peter
took him aside and began to
rebuke him. 33 But turning
around and looking at his
disciples, he rebuked Peter,
saying, “Get behind me,
Satan! For yoʋ are not
thinking about the things
of God, but the things of
men.”
34 Then he called the
crowd over, along with
his disciples, and said to
them, “If anyone wants to

The Transfiguration
2 After six days Jesus took
Peter, James, and John, and
led them up on a high moun-

he was transfigured before
them. 3 His garments be-

is good for us to be here.
Let us make three shelters,
one for yoʋ, one for Moses,
and one for Elijah.” 6 (For
they were terrified, and he
did not know †what to say.)
7 Then a cloud came and
overshadowed them, and a
voice came from the ‡cloud:
“This is my beloved Son; lis-
ten to him!” 8 And suddenly,
when they looked around,
they no longer saw anyone
with them but Jesus.
9 As they were coming
down from the mountain,
* 9:3 like snow, 70.6% ¦ — CT 0.9%

Jesus ordered them to tell
no one what they had seen
until the Son of Man had
risen from the dead. 10 So
they kept the matter to them-
selves, discussing what this
rising from the dead could
mean. 11 Then they asked
him, “Why do the scribes say
that Elijah must come first?”
12 He §answered them, “Eli-
jah does indeed come first

then is it written that

“O faithless generation,
how long shall I be with
you?
How long shall I

Bring
him to me.” 20 So they
brought the boy to him.
When the spirit saw Jesus, it
immediately threw the boy
into convulsions, and he fell
on the ground and rolled
around, foaming at the
mouth. 21 Then Jesus asked
the boy's father, “How long
has this been happening
to him?” The father said,
“From childhood. 22 It often
throws him into the fire and
into the water, to destroy
him. But if yoʋ are able
to do anything, help us and
have compassion on us.”
23 Jesus said to him, “†The
question is whether yoʋ
are able to believe. All
things are possible for
the one who believes.”
24 Immediately the child's
father cried out and said
‡with tears,
“I §believe,

28 Now when Jesus came
into the house, his disciples

kind cannot come out by
anything except prayer

True Greatness
33 Then *Jesus came to Ca-
pernaum, and when he was
in the house, he asked the
disciples, “What were you
discussing †among your-
selves on the way?” 34 But
they were silent, because on
the way they had been argu-
ing with one another about
who was greater. 35 So Jesus
sat down, called the twelve
over, and said to them, “If
anyone wants to be first,
he must be last of all and a
servant to all.” 36 Then he
took a child and placed him
before them.
And taking
the child in his arms, he
said to them, 37 “Whoever
receives one child such as
this in my name receives
me; and whoever receives
me, receives not me, but
him who sent me.”

of creation, God ‘made

7 ‘For this reason a man

So then, they are no

the disciples rebuked ‡those
who were bringing them.
14 When Jesus saw this, he
was indignant and said to
them, “Let the little chil-
dren come to me; do not
hinder them, for the king-
dom of God belongs to
such as these. 15 Truly I
say to you, whoever does
not receive the kingdom
of God like a little child
will certainly not enter
it.” 16 And taking the chil-
dren in his arms, he laid his
hands on them and blessed
them.

was dejected by what Jesus
said and went away sorrow-
ful, for he had many posses-
sions.
23 Then
Jesus looked
around and said to his
disciples, “How difficult
it will be for those who
have riches to enter the
kingdom of God!” 24 The
disciples were amazed at
his words. But Jesus said
to them again, “Children,
how difficult it is *for
those who trust in riches
to enter the kingdom of
God! 25 †It is easier for a
camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for
a rich person to enter the
kingdom of God.” 26 They
were completely astonished
at this and said to ‡one
another, “Who then can
be saved?” 27 Jesus looked
at them and said, “With
men it is impossible, but
not with God.
For all
things are possible with
God.” 28 Peter began to say
to him, “Behold, we have
left everything and followed
yoʋ.” 29 Jesus §answered,

19 Yoʋ know the command-

The Request of James and
John
35 Then
James and John,
‡the sons of Zebedee, came
to him and §said, “Teacher,
we want yoʋ to do for us
whatever we *ask.” 36 So
he said to them, “What do
you want me to do for
you?” 37 They said to him,
“Grant to us that we may
sit, one on yoʋr right and
one on yoʋr left, in yoʋr
glory.” 38 But Jesus said to
them, “You do not know
what you are asking. Are
you able to drink the cup
that I drink, †and to be
baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?”
39 They said to him, “We
are able.” Then Jesus said
to them, “You will ‡indeed
drink the cup that I drink,
and be baptized with the
baptism that I am bap-
tized with, 40 but to sit on
my right §and on my left is
not mine to give, but it is
for those for whom it has
been prepared.” 41 When
the ten heard this, they be-
gan to be indignant with
James and John. 42 So Je-
sus called them over and
said to them, “You know
that those who are rec-
ognized as rulers of the
Gentiles lord it over them,

32 Now they were on the

Jesus was walking ahead
of them, and they were
amazed.
But §as they
followed they were afraid.
Again he took the twelve
aside and began to tell them
what was going to happen
to him: 33 “Behold, we

and the Son of Man will

They will condemn him to

said to him, “What do yoʋ
want me to do for yoʋ?”
The blind man said to him,
“Rabboni, I want to receive
my sight.” 52 Jesus said to
him, “Go; yoʋr faith has
healed yoʋ.” Immediately
he received his sight and
began following Jesus on the
road.

“Hosanna!
Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is the ‡kingdom of
our father David that
is coming in the name
of the Lord!
Hosanna in the highest!”
Then
Jesus
entered
Jerusalem and went into the
temple courts. When he had
looked around at everything,
he went out to Bethany with
the twelve, since the hour
was already late.
11
Jesus Curses the Fig Tree
12 On the next day, as they
went out from Bethany, Je-
sus was hungry. 13 Seeing in
the distance a fig tree that
had leaves, he went to find
out if it had any fruit. When
he came to it, he found noth-
ing but leaves, because it
was not the season for figs.
14 In response Jesus said to
the fig tree, “May no one
ever eat fruit from yoʋ
again.” And his disciples
heard it.
Jesus Cleanses the Temple
Then they §came to
Jerusalem, and Jesus entered
the temple courts and began
driving out those who were
selling and buying there.
He overturned the tables of
the money changers and the
seats of those who were sell-
ing doves, 16 and he would
not allow anyone to carry
anything through the temple
courts. 17 Then he began
to teach *the people, say-
ing, “Is it not written, ‘My
house shall be called a
house of prayer for all
nations’? But you have
made it a den of robbers.”
18 When the †scribes and the
chief priests heard this, they
began looking for a way to
destroy him, for they were
afraid of him, because the
entire crowd was astonished
at his teaching. 19 And when
evening came, ‡he went out
of the city.
15
The Withered Fig Tree

went along, they saw that

happened and said to Jesus,
“Rabbi, behold, the fig tree

said to them, “Have faith

scribes, and the elders came
up to him 28 and said to
him, “By what authority

29 Jesus *answered them,
“I will †also ask you one
question;

and I will tell you by

these things: 30 Did John's
authority to baptize come

they §considered it among
themselves, saying, “*If we

Then Jesus began to
speak to them in parables:
“A man planted a vine-
yard, put a fence around
it, dug a pit for the
winepress, built a tower,
leased it to farmers, and
left the country. 2 At har-
vest time he sent a ser-

sent many others, some
of whom they beat, and
some of whom they killed.
6 Now he still had §his
one beloved son. He sent
him to them *as well, last
of all, saying, ‘They will
have respect for my son.’
7 But †the farmers said to
one another, ‘This is the
heir.
Come, let us kill
him, and the inheritance
will be ours.’ 8 So they
took him, killed him, and
threw him out of the vine-

the chief priests,
the scribes, and the elders
were looking for a way to ar-
rest Jesus because they knew
he had spoken the parable
against them. But they were
afraid of the crowd, so they
left him and went away.
The Question About Pay-
ing Taxes to Caesar
13 Later they sent to him
some of the Pharisees and
the Herodians, to trap him
in his speech. 14 They came
and said to him, “Teacher,
we know that yoʋ are true
and defer to no one, for
yoʋ do not show partiality
but teach the way of God
in truth. §Is it lawful to
pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
15 Should we give, or should
we not give?” But knowing
their hypocrisy, Jesus said to
them, “Why are you test-
ing me? Bring me a denar-
ius and let me look at it.”
16 So they brought one. Then

he said to them, “Whose

“Caesar's.” 17 †In response
Jesus said to them, “Render
to Caesar the things that
are Caesar's, and to God
the things that are God's.”
And they were ‡amazed at
him.
24 Jesus ‡answered
them,
“Is this not why you are in
error, because you know
neither the Scriptures nor
the power of God? 25 For
when people rise from the
dead, they neither marry
nor are they given in mar-
riage. Instead, they are
like §the angels in heaven.
26 But as for the dead be-
ing raised, have you not
read in the Book of Moses,
in the passage about the
burning bush, how God
said to him, ‘I am the God
of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Ja-
cob’? 27 He is not the God
of the dead, but *the God
of the living. You have
†therefore made a serious
error.”
The Sadducees Ask About
the Resurrection
18 Then some Sadducees
(who say there is no res-
urrection) came to Jesus
and asked him, 19 “Teacher,
Moses wrote for us: ‘If a
man's brother dies, leaving
a wife but no children, that
man must marry the widow
and raise up offspring for
his brother.’ 20 Now there

second like it is this: ‘Yoʋ

There is

than

32 Then the scribe said to
him, “Yoʋ are right, Teacher.
In truth yoʋ have said
that God is one, and that
there is no other besides
him, 33 and that to love
him with all yoʋr heart,
with all yoʋr understanding,
*with all yoʋr soul, and

every whole burnt offering

and sacrifice.”
Jesus saw that the man had
answered wisely, he said to
him, “Yoʋ are not far from
the kingdom of God.” And
no one dared to ask him
questions anymore.
Whose Son Is the Christ?
Jesus taught in the
temple courts, he said, “How
can the scribes say that
the Christ is the Son of
David? 36 †For David him-
self said in the Holy Spirit,
35 As
‘The Lord said to my Lord,
“Sit at my right hand
until I ‡make yoʋr ene-
mies a footstool for
yoʋr feet.” ’
37 David himself calls him
‘Lord,’ so how is he his
son?” And the large crowd
was listening to him gladly.
Beware of the Scribes
38 Jesus also said §to them
in his teaching, “Beware
of the scribes, who like
to walk around in long
robes, and to receive
greetings in the market-
places, 39 and to have
the best seats in the
synagogues and the places
of honor at banquets,
40 who devour widows'
houses and for a pretense
make long prayers. They
will receive a more severe
judgment.”
The Widow's Offering
Later Jesus sat down
across from the treasury and
watched how the crowd was
putting money into the trea-
sury. Many rich people put
in large amounts. 42 Then
a poor widow came and
put in two small copper
coins, which are worth a
penny. 43 So Jesus called
his disciples over and said
to them, “Truly I say to
you, this poor widow has
put more money into the

Jesus Predicts the Destruc-
tion of the Temple
1 As Jesus was coming out
from the temple courts, one
of his disciples said to him,
“Teacher, look! What won-
derful stones and what won-
derful buildings!” 2 Jesus
*answered him, “Do yoʋ
see these great buildings?
There will certainly not
be †left one stone upon

mors of wars, do not be
*alarmed, for these things
must take place, but the
end is not yet. 8 For nation
will rise up against nation,
and kingdom against king-

quakes in various places,
along with famines †and
riots. These are the begin-

9 “You must watch out
for ‡yourselves, for they
will deliver you up to

Signs of the End of the Age
as Jesus was sit-

4 “Tell us, when will these
things happen? And what
will be the sign when all
these things are about to be

scribes were looking for a
way to arrest Jesus by stealth
and kill him. 2 *But they
said, “Not during the feast,
otherwise there will be a riot
among the people.”
Jesus Anointed at Bethany
3 Meanwhile Jesus was in
Bethany, reclining at the ta-
ble in the house of Simon the
leper, and a woman came
with an alabaster jar of very
expensive ointment made of
pure nard. She broke the
alabaster jar and poured
out the ointment on his
head. 4 But some were ex-
pressing indignation to one
†another, saying, “For what
purpose has this ointment
been wasted? 5 It could have
been sold for more than
three hundred denarii, and
the money could have been
given to the poor.” So they
began scolding her. 6 But Je-
sus said, “Leave her alone.
Why are you causing trou-
ble for her? She has done
a good deed to me. 7 For
you always have the poor
with you, and you ‡can
do good to them whenever

Judas Agrees to Betray Je-
sus
10 Then Judas Iscariot,
one of the twelve, went
to the chief priests to
deliver Jesus up to them.

had come, they were glad
and promised to give him
money. So he was looking
for a way to betray Jesus at
an opportune time.

sus had told them, and they
prepared the Passover.
17 When it was evening,
Jesus came with the twelve.
18 As they were reclining at
the table and eating, Jesus
said, “Truly I say to you,
one of you who is eating
with me will betray me.”
19 So they began to be sor-
rowful and to say one af-
ter another, “Surely not I?”
‡and, “Surely not I?” 20 Jesus
§answered them, “It is one

The Passover with the Dis-
ciples
12 On the first day of the
Feast of Unleavened Bread,
when the Passover lamb
is sacrificed, Jesus' disciples
said to him, “Where do yoʋ
want us to go and make
preparations for yoʋ to eat
the Passover?” 13 So he sent

singing a hymn, they went
out to the Mount of Olives.
Jesus Predicts Peter's De-
nial
27 Then Jesus said to them,
“All of you will fall away
†because of me this night.
For it is written, ‘I will
strike the shepherd, and
the sheep will be scat-
tered.’ 28 However, after
I have been raised up, I
will go ahead of you to
Galilee.” 29 But Peter said
to him, “Even if everyone
else falls away, I will not.”
30 Jesus said to him, “Truly
I say to yoʋ that today,
on this night, before a
rooster crows twice, yoʋ
will deny me three times.”
31 But Peter said ‡all the
more vehemently, “Even if
I must die with yoʋ, I will
certainly not deny yoʋ.” And
they all said the same thing.

of Gethsemane
32 Then they went to a
place called Gethsemane,
and Jesus said to his
disciples, “Sit here while

took with him Peter, James,
and John, and began to
be greatly disturbed and
§distressed. 34 He said to
them, “My soul is very
sorrowful, even to the
point of death; stay here
and keep watch.” 35 Going
a little farther, he fell on *the
ground and prayed that, if
it were possible, the hour
might pass from him. 36 He
said, “Abba, Father, all
things are possible for
yoʋ. Take this cup away
from me; nevertheless,
not what I will, but what
yoʋ will.” 37 Then he came
and found them sleeping,
and said to Peter, “Simon,
are yoʋ sleeping? Could
†yoʋ not keep watch for
one hour? 38 Keep watch
and pray, lest you enter
into temptation.
The
spirit indeed is willing,
but the flesh is weak.”
39 Once again he went away
and prayed the same prayer.
40 When he ‡returned, he
found them sleeping again,
for their eyes were §heavy,
and they did not know what
to say in response. 41 Then
he came a third time and
said to them, “Sleep on now

is enough; the hour has
come.
Behold, the Son
of Man is delivered up
into the hands of sinners.

Jesus Arrested
43 Immediately, as he was
still speaking, *Judas ar-
rived, †who was one of the
twelve.
With him was a
‡large crowd with swords
and clubs, sent by the chief
priests, the scribes, and the
elders. 44 Now his betrayer
had given them a signal, say-
ing, “Whomever I kiss, he is
the one; arrest him and lead
him away under guard.”
45 When Judas came, he im-
mediately went up to Jesus
and said §to him, “*Rabbi!
Rabbi!” And he kissed him.
46 Then they took hold of Je-
sus and arrested him. 47 But
one of the bystanders drew
his sword, struck the servant
of the high priest, and cut off
his ear. 48 Then Jesus said to
them, “Have you come out
to arrest me with swords
and clubs as you would
against a robber? 49 I was
with you daily, teaching
in the temple courts, and
you did not arrest me. But
these things are happen-
ing so that the Scriptures
may be fulfilled.” 50 Then
they all left him and fled.
Jesus Faces the Sanhedrin
Then they led Jesus
away to the high priest, and
all the chief priests, the el-
ders, and the scribes were
assembled §together with
him. 54 Peter had followed
Jesus at a distance, right into
the courtyard of the high
priest. There he sat with the
officers, warming himself in
the light of the fire. 55 Now
the chief priests and the
whole Sanhedrin were seek-
ing testimony against Jesus
so that they could put him to
death, but they did not find
any. 56 For many were giv-
ing false testimony against
him, but their testimonies
did not agree. 57 Then some
stood up and gave false tes-
timony against him, declar-
ing, 58 “We heard him say,
‘I will destroy this temple
that is made with hands, and
in three days I will build
another that is not made
with hands.’ ” 59 Yet even
then their testimony did not

and asked Jesus, “Do yoʋ
make no answer? What are
these men testifying against
yoʋ?” 61 But he was silent
and made no answer. Again
the high priest asked him,
“Are yoʋ the Christ, the
Son of the Blessed One?”
62 Jesus said, “I am.

A Young Man Flees
Now a certain young
man was following Jesus,
wearing nothing but a linen
cloth. †The young men tried
to seize him, 52 but he left the
linen cloth behind and ran
away ‡from them naked.

priest tore his garments and
said, “What further need do
we have of witnesses? 64 You
have †heard his blasphemy.
What seems right to you?”
And they all condemned him
as deserving death. 65 Then
some began to spit on him,
to blindfold him, and to
beat him, saying to him,
“‡Prophesy!” And the offi-
cers §kept striking him with
the palms of their hands.
Peter Denies Jesus
70 But again he denied it. Af-
ter a little while, those who
were standing nearby said
to Peter once again, “Truly
yoʋ are one of them, for
yoʋ also are a ‡Galilean, and
yoʋr accent is like theirs.”
71 But he began to invoke
curses and to swear: “I
do not know this man of
whom you speak.” 72 §Then
a rooster crowed a second
time, and Peter remembered
what Jesus had said to him:
“Before a rooster crows
twice, yoʋ will deny me
three times.” And he broke
down and wept.

made no further answer, so
Pilate was amazed.
The Crowd Calls For Jesus'
Crucifixion
6 Now at the feast Pilate
would release one prisoner
for the people, whomever
they requested. 7 And there
was a man named Barab-
bas who was in prison with
‡his fellow insurrectionists
who had committed murder

the crowd §cried out and
began to ask Pilate to do
what he *had always done
for them. 9 Pilate answered
them, “Do you want me

knew that the chief priests
had handed Jesus over out
of envy.) 11 But the chief
priests stirred up the crowd
to have Pilate release for
them Barabbas instead. 12 In
response Pilate said to them
again, “What then †do you
want me to do with the man
you call King of the Jews?”
13 They cried out again, “Cru-
cify him!” 14 Pilate said to
them, “Why? What evil has
he done?” But they cried out
all the more, “Crucify him!”
15 Then Pilate, wishing to
satisfy the crowd, released
for them Barabbas. But he
scourged Jesus and handed
him over to be crucified.
16 So the soldiers led him
away into the palace (that
is, the governor's headquar-
ters) and called together the
entire cohort of soldiers.
17 They clothed him with
a purple robe, twisted to-
gether a crown of thorns,
and put it on him. 18 Then
they began to salute ‡him:
“Hail, King of the Jews!”
19 They kept beating him on
the head with a reed, spit-
ting on him, and bending
down on their knees to pay
homage to him. 20 When
they had finished mocking
him, they stripped him of the
purple robe and put his own
garments back on him. Then
they led him out to crucify
him.
The Crucifixion
Now a certain man
from Cyrene, Simon, the fa-
ther of Alexander and Ru-
fus, was passing by on his
way in from the country-
side. The soldiers pressed
him into service, forcing
him to carry Jesus' cross,
22 and they brought Jesus
to the place called Golgotha
(which means, “Place of the
Skull”). 23 Then they gave
him wine §to drink, mixed
with myrrh, but he did not
take it. 24 And they cruci-
fied him. Then they divided
his garments, casting lots for
them to see who would take
what. 25 It was the third

hour when they crucified
him. 26 The inscription of the
charge against him was writ-
ten as follows: “The King
of the Jews.” 27 With him
they crucified two robbers,
one on his right and one on
his left. 28 *So the Scripture
was fulfilled that says, “He
was numbered with the law-
less.” 29 Those who passed
by reviled him, shaking their
heads and saying, “Ha! Yoʋ
who would destroy the tem-
ple and build it in three
days, 30 save yoʋrself and
come down from the cross!”
31 In the same way the chief
priests also, along with the
scribes, were mocking him
among themselves, saying,
“He saved others, but he
cannot save himself. 32 Let
the Christ, the king of Israel,
come down now from the
cross, so that we may see it
and believe †him.” The men
who were crucified with him
were also insulting him.

ran and filled a sponge with
sour wine, put it on a reed,
and gave it to him to drink,
saying, “Leave him alone.
Let us see if Elijah comes
to take him down.” 37 But
Jesus let out a loud cry and
breathed his last breath.
38 Then the veil of the temple
was torn in two from top to
bottom. 39 Now when the
centurion who was standing
in front of Jesus saw how he
†cried out and breathed his
last breath, he said, “Truly
this man was the Son of
God.”
40 There were also some
women looking on from a
distance, among whom were
Mary Magdalene, Mary the
mother of James the younger
and of Joses, and Salome.
41 These women had fol-
lowed Jesus and provided
for him when he was in
Galilee.
There were also
many other women who
had come up with him to
Jerusalem.

was surprised that Jesus
was already dead, so he
called the centurion over
and asked him if Jesus ‡had
been dead for some time.
45 When he found out from
the centurion that it was
so, he granted the body to
Joseph. 46 After buying a
linen cloth and taking him
down, Joseph wrapped him
in the linen cloth and laid
him in a tomb that had been
hewn in the rock.
Then
he rolled a stone against
the entrance of the tomb.
47 And Mary Magdalene and
Mary the mother of Joses
saw where he was laid.
16
The Resurrection
the Sabbath was
over, Mary Magdalene, Mary
the mother of James, and Sa-
lome bought spices, so that
they might go and anoint Je-
sus' body. 2 Very early in the
morning *of the first day of
the week, when the sun had
risen, they went to the tomb.
3 On the way, they were

saying to one another, “Who

arrived, they looked up and
saw that the stone, which
was very large, had already
been rolled away. 5 As they
went into the tomb, they saw
a young man sitting on the
right side, clothed in a long
white robe, and they were
alarmed. 6 But he said to
them, “Do not be alarmed;
you seek Jesus of Nazareth,
who was crucified. He is
risen; he is not here. Behold,
this is the place where they
laid him. 7 And now go tell
his disciples and Peter that
he is going ahead of you to
Galilee. There you will see
him, just as he told you.”
8 So they went †out and fled
from the tomb, ‡and trem-
bling and amazement seized
them. But they did not say
anything to anyone, for they
were §afraid.*

14 Later Jesus appeared

he rebuked them for their

of the events that have been
fulfilled among us, 2 just
as those who from the be-
ginning were eyewitnesses

have delivered them to us,

Gabriel Announces John's
Birth to Zechariah
5 In the days of Herod,
the king of Judea, there was
a priest named Zechariah
who belonged to the division
of Abijah.
His wife was
of the daughters of Aaron,
and her name was Elizabeth.
6 They were both righteous
before God, walking blame-
lessly in all the command-
ments and regulations of the
Lord. 7 But they had no
children because Elizabeth
was barren, and they were
both advanced in their days.
8 While Zechariah was
serving as a priest before
God when his division was
on duty, 9 he was chosen by

of the priesthood, to enter

an angel of the Lord ap-
peared to Zechariah, stand-
ing at the right side of the
altar of incense. 12 When
Zechariah saw him, he was
startled, and fear fell upon
him. 13 But the angel said
to him, “Do not be afraid,
Zechariah, for yoʋr prayer
has been heard. Yoʋr wife
Elizabeth will bear yoʋ a
son, and yoʋ shall name him
John. 14 Yoʋ will have joy
and gladness, and many will
rejoice at his birth, 15 for he
will be great in the sight of
the Lord. He must never
drink any wine or strong
drink, and he will be filled
with the Holy Spirit, even
from his mother's womb.
16 He will turn many of the
sons of Israel to the Lord
their God. 17 And he will go
before the Lord in the spirit
and power of Elijah, to turn
the hearts of fathers back
to their children, and the
disobedient to the wisdom of
the righteous, to make ready
a people prepared for the
Lord.” 18 Zechariah said to
the angel, “How can I know
this for certain? For I am an
old man, and my wife is ad-
vanced in her days.” 19 The
angel answered him, “I am
Gabriel. I stand in the pres-
ence of God and was sent to
speak to yoʋ and bring yoʋ
this good news. 20 But be-THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE 1:21 108 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE 1:38

unable to speak until the day
that these things take place,
because yoʋ did not believe
my words, which will be
fulfilled at their appointed
time.”
21 Meanwhile, the people
were waiting for Zechariah
and wondering about his de-
lay in the temple. 22 When
he came out, he was unable
to speak to them, and they
perceived that he had seen
a vision in the temple, be-
cause he kept making signs
to them and remained un-
able to speak. 23 When the
days of his service had come
to an end, he returned to his
home.
24 After those days his wife
Elizabeth conceived and
kept herself in seclusion for
five months, saying, 25 “The
Lord has done this for me.

upon me with favor and
taken away my reproach

29 But †when Mary saw him,
she was greatly perplexed
by ‡his statement and be-
gan wondering what sort
of greeting this might be.
30 Then the angel said to
her, “Do not be afraid, Mary,
for yoʋ have found favor
with God. 31 And behold,
yoʋ will conceive in yoʋr
womb and give birth to a
son, and yoʋ shall name him
Jesus. 32 He will be great
and will be called the Son
of the Most High, and the
Lord God will give him the
throne of his father David.
33 He will reign over the
house of Jacob forever, and
of his kingdom there will be
no end.” 34 Mary said to the
angel, “How will this §be,
since I am a virgin?” 35 The
angel answered her, “The
Holy Spirit will come upon
yoʋ, and the power of the
Most High will overshadow
yoʋ; therefore the holy child
that is to be *born will be
called the Son of God. 36 And
behold, yoʋr relative Eliza-
beth has also conceived a
son in her old age, and this is
the sixth month for her who
was called barren. 37 For
nothing is impossible with
God.” 38 Then Mary said,
“Behold, I am the servant of
the Lord; may it happen to
me according to yoʋr word.”
And the angel went away
from her.

to the hill country, to a

she entered the house of

46 Then Mary said,
“My soul magnifies the Lord,

God my Savior,
48 because he has looked fa-
vorably on the hum-

And Mary remained
with Elizabeth for about
three months and then re-
turned to her house.

census, and it took place
when Quirinius was gover-

went to be registered, each

also went up from Galilee,
from the town of Nazareth,
to Judea, to the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem,
because he was of the house
and family of David, 5 to
register himself along with
Mary, his betrothed *wife,
who was with child. 6 While
they were there, the days
were fulfilled for her to give

15 When
the angels had
gone away from them into
heaven, the shepherds said
to one another, “Let us go

this thing that has happened,

went with haste and found
Mary and Joseph, and the
baby lying in the manger.
17 After seeing him, they
made ‡widely known what
they had been told about the

it were amazed at what the
shepherds told them. 19 But
Mary treasured up all these
things, pondering them in

2 during the *high priest-

the word of God came to
John the son of Zechariah
in the wilderness. 3 He went
into all the region around
the Jordan, preaching a
baptism of repentance for
the remission of sins, 4 as it
is written in the book of the
words of Isaiah the prophet,
“The voice of one crying out
in the wilderness,
‘Prepare the way of the
Lord;

and every mountain and hill
will be brought low.
The crooked roads will be

them, “Whoever has two tu-
nics must share with him
who has none, and whoever
has food must do likewise.”
12 Some tax collectors also
came to be †baptized, and
they said to him, “Teacher,
what should we do?” 13 He
said to them, “Collect no
more than what you have
been authorized to collect.”
14 Then some soldiers asked
him, “And what should we
do?” He said to them, “Do
not extort money from any-
one by ‡threats or false accu-
sations, and be content with
your wages.”
15 Now as the people were
waiting in expectation and
were all questioning in their
hearts whether John might
be the Christ, 16 John an-
swered them all, “I baptize
you with water, but one
is coming who is mightier
than I, the strap of whose
sandals I am not worthy to
untie; he will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and
fire. 17 His winnowing fork
is in his §hand, and he
will thoroughly clean out his

be baptized by him, “You

sistent with repentance, and

18 With these and many
other exhortations John
preached good news to the
people. 19 But when John
rebuked Herod the tetrarch
because of his marriage
to Herodias, his *brother's
wife, and because of all
the evils that he had done,
20 Herod
added this to
everything else: He locked
up John in prison.
The Baptism of Jesus
21 Now when all the peo-
ple were baptized, and when
Jesus had also been bap-
tized and was praying, the
heavens were opened, 22 and
the Holy Spirit descended on
him in bodily form like a
dove. Then a voice came
from †heaven, saying, “Yoʋ

Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
16 When
he came to
Nazareth, where he had
been brought up, he went
into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day, as was his
custom, and stood up to
read. 17 The scroll of †Isaiah
the prophet was handed to
him, so he ‡unrolled the
scroll and found the place
where it is written,
18 “The Spirit of the Lord
is upon me,
because he has anointed
me
to preach good news to
the poor.
He has sent me §to heal
the brokenhearted,
to proclaim release to the
captives
and recovery of sight to
the blind,
to set the oppressed free,
19 and to proclaim the year
of the Lord's favor.”
Then he rolled up the
scroll, gave it back to the at-
tendant, and sat down. The
eyes of everyone in the syna-
gogue were fixed upon him,
21 and he began to say to
them, “Today this Scrip-
ture has been fulfilled in
22 They
your hearing.”
were all speaking well of
him and were amazed at
the gracious words coming
20
out of his mouth.
They
said, “Is this not Joseph's
son?” 23 Then Jesus said to
them, “Doubtless you will
quote to me this proverb:
‘Physician, heal yoʋrself.’
Do here in yoʋr home-
town what we have heard
that yoʋ did in Caper-
24 He also said,

“Truly I say to you, no
prophet is accepted in
his hometown. 25 But in
truth I tell you, there
were many widows in Is-
rael in the days of Eli-
jah, when the sky was
shut for three years and
six months and a severe
famine came over all the
land, 26 yet Elijah was sent
to none of them except a
widow in Zarephath in the
region of Sidon. 27 There
were also many lepers in
Israel in the time of Elisha
the prophet, and none
of them was cleansed ex-
cept Naaman the Syrian.”
28 When they heard this,
all the people in the syna-
gogue were filled with rage.

out of the town, and brought
him to the brow of the hill on
which their town was built,

teaching the people. 32 They
were astonished at his teach-
ing, because his message
was spoken with authority.
33 Now in the synagogue
there was a man who had
an unclean demonic spirit,
and he cried out with a loud
voice, 34 “Leave us alone!
What do yoʋ have to do
with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
Have yoʋ come to destroy
us? I know who yoʋ are—
the Holy One of God.” 35 But
Jesus rebuked him, saying,
“Be silent and come out
of him!” Then the demon
threw the man down before
them all and came out of
him, having done him no
harm. 36 Amazement came
over all the people, and they
said to one another, “What
kind of message is this? For
with authority and power
he commands the unclean
spirits and they come out!”
37 And news about him went
out to every place in the
surrounding region.

them. 41 Demons also came
out of many, crying out, “Yoʋ
are *the Christ, the Son of
God.” But he rebuked them
and would not allow them
to speak, because they knew
that he was the Christ.
Jesus Preaches in Galilee
daybreak came,
Jesus departed and went to
a desolate place. The crowds
were seeking him, and they
came to him and tried to
keep him from leaving them.
43 But Jesus said to them,
“I must preach the good
news of the kingdom of
God to the other towns as
well, for that is why I was
sent.” 44 So he continued
preaching in the synagogues
of †Galilee.

5
Jesus Calls His First Disci-
ples
1 On one occasion, Je-
sus was standing beside the
lake of Gennesaret, and the
crowd was pressing in on
him *to listen to the word
of God. 2 He saw two boats
moored beside the lake, but
the fishermen had gotten out
of them and were washing
their nets. 3 He got into
one of the boats, the one
that was Simon's, and asked
him to put out a little way
from the shore. Then he sat
down and began teaching
the crowds from the boat.
4 When he finished speak-
ing, he said to Simon, “Put

Jesus arose, left
the synagogue, and entered
Simon's house. Now Simon's
mother-in-law was suffering
from a high fever, and they
asked Jesus to help her. 39 So
he stood over her and re-
buked the fever, and it left
her. At once she rose and
began to serve them.
40 When the sun was set-
ting, all those who had any
who were sick with various
diseases brought them to Je-
sus, and he laid his hands on

men with him did so, they
enclosed such a large num-
ber of fish that their §net
began to break. 7 So they sig-
naled to their partners in the
other boat to come and assist
them, and they came and
filled both the boats, so that
they began to sink. 8 When
Simon Peter saw this, he fell
down at Jesus' knees and
said, “Depart from me, Lord,
for I am a sinful man.” 9 For
he and all who were with
him were gripped with as-
tonishment at the catch of
fish they had taken, 10 and
so were James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, who were
partners with Simon. Then
Jesus said to Simon, “Do
not be afraid; from now
on yoʋ will be catching
people.” 11 So they brought
their boats to shore, left ev-
erything, and followed Jesus.

touched him, saying, “I am
willing; be made clean.”
Immediately the leprosy left
him. 14 Then Jesus ordered
him to tell no one, but said,
“Go show yoʋrself to the
priest, and make an of-
fering for yoʋr cleansing,
just as Moses commanded,
as a testimony to them.”
15 But the news about Je-
sus spread even more, and
large crowds would gather
together to hear him and to
be healed *by him of their
infirmities. 16 But he would
often withdraw to desolate
places and pray.
Jesus Heals a Paralytic
one of those days,
as he was teaching, some
Pharisees and teachers of

saw their faith, he said ‡to
the man, “Man, yoʋr sins
are forgiven yoʋ.” 21 But
the scribes and the Pharisees
began to question what Je-
sus said: “Who is this that
speaks blasphemies? Who
can forgive sins but God
alone?” 22 Aware of their
thoughts, Jesus answered
them, “Why are you ques-

25 Immediately the man rose
up before them, picked up
what he had been lying on,

rifying God. 26 Amazement
seized them all, and they
too began glorifying God.

answered them, “It is not

have need of a physician,
but those who are sick. 32 I
did not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to

Jesus Is Lord of the Sab-
bath
1 On the *second major
Sabbath, Jesus was going
through †the grainfields, and
his disciples were plucking
heads of grain, rubbing off
the husks in their hands, and
eating them. 2 But some of
the Pharisees said ‡to them,
“Why are you doing what
is not lawful to do on the
Sabbath?” 3 Jesus answered
them, “Have you not read
what David did when he
was hungry, he and those
who were with him, 4 how
he entered the house of
God and took and ate
the bread of the Presence,
which is not lawful for
anyone to eat except for
the priests, and how he
§also gave it to those who
were with him?” 5 Then he
said to them, “The Son of
Man is Lord *even of the
Sabbath.”
Jesus Heals a Man with a
Withered Hand
6 On another Sabbath, Je-
sus went into the synagogue
and was teaching, and a
man was there whose right
hand was withered. 7 Now
the scribes and the Phar-
isees were watching Jesus
closely to see if he would
heal on the Sabbath, so that
they could find †an accu-
sation against him. 8 But
he knew their thoughts and
said to the man with the
withered hand, “Rise and
stand here.” So he rose
9 Then
and stood there.
Jesus said to them, “‡Let
me ask you something: Is
it lawful on the Sabbath
to do good or to do evil,
to save life or to §kill?”
10 And after looking around
at them all, he said to the
man, “Stretch out yoʋr
hand.” The man did so, and
his hand was *restored, as
sound as the other. 11 But the
scribes and Pharisees were
filled with mindless rage and
discussed with one another
what they might do to Jesus.

of Alphaeus, and Simon
(who was called the Zealot),
16 Judas the son of James,
and Judas Iscariot (who be-
came a traitor).
Jesus Ministers to Great
Crowds
17 Then Jesus came down
with them and stood on
a level place.
A †crowd
of his disciples was there
along with a great multitude
of people from all Judea,
Jerusalem, and the coastal
region of Tyre and Sidon
(who had come to hear him
and to be healed of their dis-
eases), 18 ‡as well as people
who were harassed by un-
clean spirits. And they were
healed. 19 The entire crowd
was trying to touch him, be-
cause power was coming out
from him and healing them
all.
The Beatitudes
20 Then he looked up at his
disciples and said,
“Blessed are you who are
poor,
for yours is the kingdom
of God.
21 Blessed are you who
hunger now,
for you will be filled.
Blessed are you who weep

Jesus Heals a Centurion's
Servant
1 When Jesus had finished
saying all this in the hearing
of the people, he entered
Capernaum. 2 There a cen-
turion's servant, who was
highly regarded by him, was
sick and about to die. 3 The
centurion heard about Jesus
and sent some Jewish elders
to him, asking him to come
and heal his servant. 4 When
they came to Jesus, they
earnestly pleaded with him,
saying, “This man is worthy
to have yoʋ do this for him,
5 for he loves our nation and
built our synagogue for us.”
6 So Jesus went with them.
When he was not far from
the house, the centurion sent
friends to say to him, “Lord,
do not trouble yoʋrself, for
I am not worthy to have
yoʋ enter under my roof;
7 therefore I did not even
consider myself worthy to
come to yoʋ. But just say the
word, and *my servant will
be healed. 8 For I too am
a man set under authority,
with soldiers under me. I
say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he
goes; and to another, ‘Come,’
and he comes; and to my
servant, ‘Do this,’ and he
does it.” 9 When Jesus heard
this, he was amazed at the
centurion. And turning to
the crowd that was following
him, he said, “I tell you, not

Jesus Forgives a Sinful
Woman
36 One of the Pharisees
asked Jesus to eat with
him, so he went into
the Pharisee's house and
reclined at the table. 37 And
behold, a woman in the city
who was a sinner, when she
found out that Jesus was
reclining at the table in the
Pharisee's house, brought an
alabaster jar of ointment.
38 As she stood behind him at
his feet, weeping, she began
to wet his feet with her
tears. Then she wiped them
with the hair of her head,
kissed his feet, and anointed
them with the ointment.
39 When the Pharisee who
had invited him saw it,
he said to himself, “If this
man were §a prophet, he
would know who is touching
him and what kind of
woman she is—that she is
a sinner.” 40 Jesus said to
‘We played the flute for him in response, “Simon,

Some Women Accompany
Jesus
1 Soon afterward Jesus was
going through every city
and village, preaching and
proclaiming the good news
of the kingdom of God. The
twelve were with him, 2 as
well as some women who
had been healed of *evil
spirits and infirmities: Mary
(called Magdalene) from
whom seven demons had
gone out, 3 Joanna the wife
of Chuza (Herod's steward),
Susanna, and many others.
These women provided for
Jesus †and his disciples out
of their own resources.
The Parable of the Sower
a large crowd was
gathering and people were
coming to Jesus from town
after town, he spoke by way
of a parable: 5 “A sower
went out to sow his seed.
As he sowed, some seed
fell along the path and
was trampled underfoot,
and the birds of the sky
devoured it. 6 Other seed
fell on the rock, and as
it grew up, it withered
away because it had no
moisture. 7 Other seed fell
among the thorns, and the
thorns grew up with it and
choked it. 8 But other seed
fell ‡into good soil, and
when it grew, it produced

a hundred times more
than what was sown.” As
he said this, he called out,
“He who has ears to hear,
let him hear.”
The Purpose of Parables
9 Then his disciples asked
him, “What does this para-
ble mean?” 10 He said, “To
you it has been given to
know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God, but to
the rest I speak in para-
bles, so that ‘they may see
but not perceive, and hear
but not understand.’

hear the word, hold fast to
it with an honest and good
heart, and bear fruit with
patient endurance.
A Lamp Under a Con-
tainer
16 §“No one lights a lamp
and covers it with a con-
tainer or puts it under a
bed. Instead, it is put on
a lampstand, so that those
who come in may see its
light. 17 For nothing is hid-
den that will not be made
manifest, nor is anything
hidden away that will *not
be made known and come
to light. 18 Therefore con-
sider how you hear, for
whoever has will be given
more, but whoever does
not have, even what he
thinks he has will be taken

The Parable of the Sower

11 “Now this is the mean-

over to the other side of
the lake.” So they set out,
23 and as they were sailing
along, he fell asleep. Then
a windstorm came down on
the lake, and they were in
danger as the boat was be-
ing swamped by the waves.
24 So they came to Jesus and
woke him up, saying, “Mas-
ter, Master, we are perish-
ing!” Then he ‡rose and re-
buked the wind and the rag-
ing water. They ceased, and
all was calm. 25 Then he said
to his disciples, “Where is
your faith?” But they were
afraid and amazed, saying to
one another, “Who then is
this, that he commands even
the winds and the water,
and they obey him?”
29 For Jesus had commanded
the unclean spirit to come
out of the man. Many times
it had seized him, and he
would be bound with chains
and shackles and kept under
guard, but he would break
the chains and be driven
by the demon into deso-
late places. 30 Jesus then
asked him, “What is yoʋr
name?” He said, “Legion,”
for many demons had en-
tered him. 31 And ‡he begged
Jesus not to command them
to go away into the abyss.
32 Now there was a herd of
many pigs feeding there on
the mountain. The demons
begged Jesus to permit them
to enter the pigs. So he gave
them permission. 33 Then
the demons came out of the

But Jesus sent him

So the man went

the fringe of his garment,
and the flow of her blood
stopped at once. 45 Then
Jesus said, “Who touched
me?” When everyone de-
nied it, Peter §and those
who were with him said,
“Master, the crowds are sur-
rounding yoʋ and pressing
against *yoʋ, and yet yoʋ
say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”
46 But Jesus said, “Someone
touched me, for I know
that power has gone out
from me.” 47 When the
woman saw that she could
not escape notice, she came
trembling and fell down be-
fore him, and in the pres-
ence of all the people she
†told him the reason why she
had touched him, and how
she had been healed at once.
48 Then Jesus said to her,
“‡Take courage, daughter;
yoʋr faith has healed yoʋ.
Go in peace.”
49 While he was still speak-
ing, someone came from
the ruler of the synagogue's
house and said §to him,
“Yoʋr daughter has died; do
not trouble the *teacher.”
50 But when Jesus heard this,
he said to him in response,

behold, there came a man
named Jairus, who was a
ruler of the synagogue. He
fell down at Jesus' feet and
begged him to come to his
house, 42 because he had an
only daughter, about twelve
years old, and she was dying.
As Jesus went on his way,
the crowds were pressing
in on him. 43 Now there
was a woman who had suf-
fered from a flow of blood
for twelve ‡years, and even
though she had spent her en-

to the house, Jesus †allowed
no one to go in, except Pe-
ter, ‡John, James, and the
child's father and mother.
52 Meanwhile, all the people
were weeping and mourn-
ing for her, but Jesus said,
“Do not §weep; she is not
dead but sleeping.” 53 And
they began laughing at him,
knowing that she was dead.
54 But Jesus *put them all
outside, took hold of the
girl's hand, and called out,
“Child, arise!” 55 Her spirit
returned, and she got up at
once. Then he told them to
give her something to eat.
56 Her parents were amazed,
but he ordered them not to
tell anyone what had hap-
pened.

Jesus Sends Out the
Twelve Apostles
1 Then Jesus called *the
twelve together and gave
them power and authority
over all demons and to heal
diseases, 2 and he sent them
to proclaim the kingdom of
God and to heal the sick.
3 He said to them, “Take

ney, neither †staffs, knap-

there until you leave that

receive you, shake off the
very dust from your feet
as you leave that town,
as a testimony against
them.” 6 So they set out
and went throughout the vil-
lages, preaching the gospel
and healing people every-
where.
Herod is Perplexed About
Jesus
7 Now Herod the tetrarch
heard about everything that
§Jesus was doing, and he
was greatly perplexed, be-
cause some were saying that
John had been raised from
the dead, 8 others were say-
ing that Elijah had appeared,
and others were saying that
one of the ancient prophets
had risen. 9 But Herod said,
“John I beheaded; who then
is this man about whom I
hear such things?” So he
was looking for an opportu-
nity to see him.
The Feeding of the Five
Thousand
10 When the apostles re-
turned, they told Jesus about
all they had done. Then he
took them along and with-
drew privately to *a des-
olate place belonging to a
town called Bethsaida. 11 But
when the crowds found out
about it, they followed him.

So he welcomed them and
spoke to them about the
kingdom of God, and cured
those who had need of heal-
ing.
12 As the day began to
draw to a close, the twelve
came up and said to Je-
sus, “Send the crowd away
so that they may go into
the surrounding villages and
countryside and find lodging
and provisions, for we are in
a desolate place here.” 13 But
he said to them, “You give
them something to eat.”
They said, “We have only
five loaves and two fish—

were about five thousand
men.) Then he said to his
disciples, “Have them sit
down in groups of †fifty
each.” 15 The disciples did
so, and had everyone sit
down. 16 Then Jesus took the
five loaves and the two fish,
and looking up to heaven,
he blessed and broke them,
and gave them to the disci-
ples to set before the crowd.
17 They all ate and were
filled, and what was left over
was picked up, twelve bas-
kets of broken pieces.
Peter Declares That Jesus
Is the Christ
18 Once when Jesus was
praying in private and the
disciples were with him, he
asked them, “Who do the
crowds say that I am?”
† 9:14 fifty ¦ about fifty CT
PCK TR
19 They answered, “Some say
John the Baptist, others say
Elijah, and others say that

to them, “But who do you
say that I am?” Peter an-
swered, “The Christ of God.”
Jesus Predicts His Death
and Resurrection
21 Jesus then warned them
and instructed them to tell
this to no one, 22 saying,
“The Son of Man must suf-
fer many things and be re-
jected by the elders, chief
priests, and scribes, and
he must be killed and on
the third day ‡rise again.”
23 Then he said to them
all, “If anyone wants to
come after me, he must
deny himself, take up his
§cross, and follow me.
24 For whoever wants to
save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life
for my sake will save it.
25 For what does it ben-
efit a person if he gains
the whole world but loses
or forfeits himself? 26 If
anyone is ashamed of me
and my words, the Son
of Man will be ashamed
of him when he comes in
his glory and the glory of
the Father and the holy
angels. 27 But truly I say
to you, there are some
standing here who will
certainly not taste death
until they see the kingdom
of God.”

28 About
eight days after
he had spoken these words,
he took Peter, John, and
James, and went up on the
mountain to pray. 29 As he
was praying, the appearance
of his face was altered, and
his clothing became dazzling
white. 30 And behold, two
men were talking with him;
they were Moses and Elijah,
31 who appeared in glory
and were speaking about
his departure, which he was
about to bring to fulfillment
in Jerusalem. 32 Now Peter
and those who were with
him were heavy with sleep,
but when they became fully
awake, they saw his glory
and the two men standing
with him. 33 As the men
were parting from Jesus, Pe-
ter said to him, “Master, it is
good for us to be here. Let
us make three shelters, one
for yoʋ, one for Moses, and
one for Elijah,” not knowing
what he was saying. 34 But
as he was saying this, a
cloud came and overshad-
owed them, and they were
afraid as they entered the
cloud. 35 Then a voice came
from the cloud, saying, “This
is my *beloved Son; listen to
him!” 36 When the voice fin-
ished speaking, they found
that Jesus was alone. The
disciples kept silent and did
not tell anyone in those days
about any of the things they
had seen.
Jesus Heals a Boy with an
Unclean Spirit
37 On the next day, when
they came down from the
mountain, Jesus was met by
a large crowd. 38 And be-
hold, a man from among the
crowd cried out, “Teacher,
I beg †yoʋ to look at my
son, for he is my one and
only child. 39 A spirit seizes
him, and he suddenly cries
out; it convulses him so
that he foams at the mouth.
It hardly ever leaves him
alone, bruising him severely.
40 I begged yoʋr disciples to
cast it out, but they could
41 Jesus answered,
not.”
“O faithless and perverse
generation, how long shall
I be with you and bear
with you? Bring yoʋr son
here.” 42 Now as the boy
was approaching, the demon
threw him down and shook
him with convulsions. But
Jesus rebuked the unclean
spirit, healed the boy, and
gave him back to his father.
43 And they were all aston-
ished at the majesty of God.
Jesus Predicts His Death a
Second Time
But while everyone was
marveling at all that Jesus
‡had done, he said to his dis-
ciples, 44 “Let these words
sink into your ears: The
Son of Man is about to
be delivered up into the
hands of men.” 45 But they
did not understand what this
meant.

could not grasp it, and they
were afraid to ask him about
it.
True Greatness
46 Now an argument arose
among the disciples as to
which of them was greater.
47 But Jesus, §perceiving the
thoughts of their hearts, took
a child and placed him by
his side. 48 Then he said to
them, “Whoever receives
this child in my name re-
ceives me, and whoever
receives me receives him

preparations for him. 53 But
the people there refused
to welcome him, because
his face was set to go to
Jerusalem. 54 When §his dis-
ciples James and John saw
this, they said, “Lord, do yoʋ
want us to command fire
to come down from heaven
and consume *them, just like
Elijah did?” 55 But he turned
and rebuked †them, saying,
“You do not know what

did not come to destroy

them.” And they went on to

17 When
Jesus Rejoices in the Spirit
21 At that same hour Jesus
rejoiced in the *Spirit and
said, “I praise yoʋ, Fa-
ther, Lord of heaven and
earth, because yoʋ have
hidden these things from
the wise and intelligent,
and revealed them to in-
fants.
Yes, Father, for
so it was well-pleasing in
yoʋr †sight.” 22 Then he
turned to the disciples and
said, “All things have been
delivered to me by my
Father.
No one knows
who the Son is except the
Father, and no one knows
who the Father is except
the Son, and anyone to
whom the Son chooses to
reveal him.”
23 Then he turned to the
disciples and said privately,
“Blessed are the eyes
that see what you see!
24 For I tell you that
many prophets and kings
wished to see the things
you see but did not see
them, and to hear the
things you hear but did
not hear them.”
The Parable of the Good
Samaritan
25 And behold, a lawyer
stood up to test Jesus, say-
ing, “Teacher, what must I
do to inherit eternal life?”
26 Jesus said to him, “What
is written in the law? How
do yoʋ read it?” 27 He
answered, “Yoʋ shall love
the Lord yoʋr God with all
yoʋr heart, with all yoʋr
soul, with all yoʋr strength,
and with all yoʋr mind; and
yoʋ shall love yoʋr neighbor
as yoʋrself.” 28 Jesus said to
him, “Yoʋ have answered
correctly; do this and yoʋ
will live.”
29 But wishing to justify
himself, he said to Jesus,
“And who is my neighbor?”
30 Jesus replied, “A man

cho from Jerusalem and
fell among robbers. They
stripped him, beat him,
and went away, leaving
him ‡as he was, half dead.

In response one of
the lawyers said to him,
“Teacher, by saying these
things, yoʋ insult us as well.”
46 But Jesus said, “Woe to
you lawyers as well! For
you burden people with
burdens that are hard to
bear, but you yourselves

Woe to the Pharisees and
Lawyers
37 As Jesus was §speaking,
a Pharisee invited him to
have a meal with him, so
Jesus went in and reclined
at the table. 38 The Pharisee
was amazed when he saw
that Jesus did not first per-
form the ritual washing be-
fore the meal. 39 So the Lord
said to him, “You Pharisees

cup and the platter, but
inside you are full of plun-
der and evil. 40 You fools!
Did not he who made the
outside also make the in-
side? 41 But give as alms
the things that are on the

thing will be clean for you.

52 Woe to you lawyers!
For you have taken away

You yourselves have not

hindered those who were

53 As he ‡was saying these
things to them, the scribes
and the Pharisees began to
oppose him fiercely and to
question him closely about
many things, 54 lying in wait
for him §and seeking to
catch him in some word
coming out of his *mouth, so
that they might accuse him.

Beware of the Leaven of
the Pharisees
1 Meanwhile, when the
crowd had gathered to-
gether by the thousands, so
that they were trampling on
one another, Jesus began to
speak first to his disciples:
“Beware of the leaven

3 Therefore whatever you
have said in the darkness
will be heard in the

be proclaimed on the
housetops.
Fear God Alone
4 “I tell you, my friends,
do not be afraid of those
who kill the body, and
after that have nothing
more they can do. 5 But
I will tell you whom you
should fear: Fear him who
has authority to throw
you into hell after your
body has been killed. Yes,
I tell you, fear him! 6 Are

The Parable of the Rich
Fool
13 Then someone from
among the crowd said to
him, “Teacher, tell my
brother to divide the family
inheritance with me.” 14 But
Jesus said to him, “Man,
who appointed me as a
judge or arbitrator over
you?” 15 Then he said to
them, “Watch out and be
on your guard against
‡covetousness, for one's
life does not consist in

told them a parable: “The
land of a certain rich man
produced
abundantly.
17 So he thought to him-
self, ‘What should I do, for
I do not have anywhere to
store my crops?’ 18 Then
he said, ‘This is what I
will do: I will tear down
my barns and build larger
ones, and there I will
store all my §produce and
my goods. 19 And I will
say to my soul, “Soul,
yoʋ have many goods
laid up for many years;
relax, eat, drink, and be
merry.” ’ 20 But God said
to him, ‘Yoʋ fool! This
very night yoʋr life will
be demanded *back from
yoʋ, and the things yoʋ
have prepared, whose will
they be?’ 21 This is how
it will be with anyone
who lays up treasure for
himself and is not rich
toward God.”
Do Not Be Anxious
22 Then Jesus said to †his
disciples, “Therefore I tell
you, do not be anxious
about your life, what you
will eat, or about your
body, what you will wear.
23 ‡Life is more than food,
and the body is more
than clothing. 24 Consider
the ravens: They do not

no storehouse or barn,

Repent or Perish
there were some
present at that very time
who told Jesus about the
Galileans whose blood Pilate
had mixed with their sac-
rifices. 2 Jesus responded
to them, “Do you think
that those Galileans were
worse sinners than all
the other Galileans be-
cause they suffered *such
things? 3 No, I tell you,
but if you do not repent,
you will all likewise per-
ish. 4 Or those eighteen
who were killed when the
tower in Siloam fell on
them, do you think that
they were worse offenders
than all the other people
who dwell in Jerusalem?
5 No, I tell you, but if you
do not repent, you will all
likewise perish.”

Jesus Heals a Disabled
Woman
10 One Sabbath Jesus was
teaching in one of the syna-
gogues. 11 And behold, there
was a woman who had suf-
fered from a spirit of disabil-
ity for eighteen years. She
was bent over and could not
stand up completely straight.
12 When Jesus saw her, he
called her over and said
to her, “Woman, yoʋ are
set free from yoʋr dis-
ability.” 13 Then he laid
his hands on her, and at
once her back was made
straight, and she began glo-
rifying God. 14 But the ruler
of the synagogue, indignant
because Jesus had healed
on the Sabbath, said to the
crowd in response, “There
are six days in which work
should be done; so come
and be healed on those days
and not on the Sabbath day.”
15 Then the Lord answered
him, “§Hypocrites!

this, all his adversaries were
put to shame, and the entire
crowd was rejoicing over all
the glorious things that he
was doing.
The Parable of the Mus-
tard Seed
18 Then Jesus said, “What
is the kingdom of God
like? To what should I
compare it? 19 It is like a
grain of mustard seed that
a man took and sowed in
his garden. It grew and
became a *large tree, and

in its branches.”

his way to Jerusalem.

of him was a man suffering
from dropsy. 3 In response
Jesus said to the lawyers
and Pharisees, “Is it lawful
to heal on the *Sabbath?”
4 But they remained silent.
So Jesus took hold of the
man, healed him, and sent
him away. 5 Then he said
to them, “Which of you

not immediately pull him

‡him no answer about these

12 Jesus also said to the
man who had invited him,
“When yoʋ prepare a lun-

or yoʋr rich neighbors.

§everything is now ready.’
18 But they all alike began
to make excuses.
The
first one said to him, ‘I
have bought a field, and
I need to go out and see
it.
I ask yoʋ to have
me excused.’ 19 Another
said, ‘I have bought five
yoke of oxen, and I am
on my way to try them
out. I ask yoʋ to have me
excused.’ 20 Still another
said, ‘I have married a
woman, and for that rea-
son I cannot come.’ 21 So
the servant came back
and told these things to
his master.
Then the
master of the house be-
came angry and said to his
servant, ‘Go out quickly
into the streets and lanes
of the city, and bring in
the poor, the maimed,
the *lame, and the blind.’
22 The servant said, ‘Mas-
ter, †it has been done
as yoʋ commanded, and
there is still room.’ 23 So
the master said to the
servant, ‘Go out to the
highways and hedges and
compel people to come in,
so that my house may be
filled. 24 For I tell you that
none of those men who
were invited shall taste
my banquet.’ ‡For many
are called, but few are
chosen.”
The Parable of the Great
Banquet
15 When one of the men
reclining at the table with
Jesus heard these things, he
said to him, “Blessed is †he

16 Jesus said to him, “A man

banquet he sent his ser-

arose and went to his fa-
ther. But while he was
still far away, his father
saw him and was moved
with compassion. So he
ran to his son, threw his
arms around his neck,
and kissed him. 21 Then
the son said to him, ‘Fa-
ther, I have sinned against
heaven and before yoʋ.
I am no longer worthy

22 But the father said to
his servants, ‘§Bring out

‘Father, give me the share

divided his assets between

days later, the younger
son gathered together all

he squandered his prop-

father, ‘Behold, all these

called the steward in and
said to him, ‘What is
this I hear about yoʋ?
Give an account of yoʋr
stewardship, for yoʋ can
no longer be steward.’
3 The steward said to
himself, ‘What should I
do, since my master is

strong enough to dig, and
I am ashamed to beg. 4 I
know what I will do so
that when I am removed

he summoned each one
of his master's debtors.
He said to the first, ‘How
much do yoʋ owe my
master?’ 6 The man said,
‘A hundred measures of
oil.’ The steward said to
him, ‘Take yoʋr bill, sit
down quickly, and write

other, ‘And how much do
yoʋ owe?’ The man said,

the kingdom of God was

them, “The kingdom of

himself, ‘Though I neither

11 The

The Rich Young Ruler
18 Then a certain ruler
asked him, “Good Teacher,
what must I do to inherit
eternal life?” 19 Jesus said
to him, “Why do yoʋ call
me good? No one is good
except God alone. 20 Yoʋ
know the commandments:
‘Do not commit adultery,
Do not murder, Do not
steal, Do not give false
testimony, Honor yoʋr fa-
ther and §yoʋr mother.’ ”
21 The man said, “All these I
have kept from my youth.”
22 When Jesus heard this,
he said to him, “One thing
yoʋ still lack: Sell every-
thing yoʋ have and dis-
tribute the money to the
poor, and yoʋ will have
treasure in heaven; then
come follow me.” 23 But
when the man heard this,
he became very sorrowful,
for he was extremely rich.
24 *When Jesus saw that the
man had become very sor-
rowful, he said, “How dif-
ficult it will be for those
who have riches to enter
the kingdom of God! 25 For
it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of
a needle than for a rich
person to enter the king-
dom of God.” 26 Those who
heard this said, “Who then
can be saved?” 27 Jesus said,
“What is impossible with
men is possible with God.”
28 Then Peter said, “Behold,
we have left †everything and
Let the Little Children

15 Now people were even
bringing their babies to Je-
sus so that he might touch
them. When the disciples
saw this, they rebuked those
who were bringing them,
16 but Jesus called for them
and said, “Let the little
children come to me and
do not hinder them, for
the kingdom of God be-
longs to such as these.
17 Truly I say to you, who-
ever does not receive the
kingdom of God like a lit-
tle child will certainly not
enter it.”

Jesus Predicts His Death
and Resurrection a Third
Time
31 Then Jesus took the
twelve aside and said to
them, “Behold, we are go-
ing up to Jerusalem, and
everything that is writ-

the Son of Man will be
fulfilled. 32 For he will
be delivered up to the

out, “Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!” 39 Then
those who were out in front
rebuked him, telling him to
be silent. But he cried out
all the more, “Son of David,
have mercy on me!” 40 So Je-
sus stopped and ordered the
man to be brought to him.
When the man drew near,
Jesus asked him, 41 “What
do yoʋ want me to do for
yoʋ?” He said, “Lord, I
want to receive my sight.”
42 So Jesus said to him,
“Receive yoʋr sight; yoʋr
faith has healed yoʋ.”
43 Immediately he received
his sight and began follow-
ing Jesus, glorifying God.
And when all the people saw
it, they gave praise to God.

Then Jesus entered
Jericho and was passing
2 And behold,

there was a man named
Zacchaeus. He was a chief
tax collector, who was rich.

6 So he hurried down and
received Jesus with joy.
7 When all the people saw it,
they grumbled, saying, “He
has gone in to stay with a
sinful man.” 8 But Zacchaeus
stood there and said to the
Lord, “Behold, half of my

poor, and if I have extorted

this man also is a son of
Abraham. 10 For the Son

save the lost.”
The Parable of the Ten
Minas
11 Now as the people were
listening to this, Jesus went
on to tell a parable, because
he was near Jerusalem, and
because they thought that
the kingdom of God was go-
ing to appear at once. 12 So
he said, “A man of no-
ble birth went to a dis-
tant country to receive a
kingdom for himself and

ten of his servants, he
gave them ten minas and
said to them, ‘Engage in
business until I come.’
14 Now his citizens hated
him and sent a delega-
tion after him, saying, ‘We
do not want this man to
reign over us.’ 15 When
he returned after receiv-
ing the kingdom, he sum-
moned the servants to
whom he had given the
money, so that he might
know †who had gained
what by engaging in busi-
ness. 16 The first came
before him and said, ‘Mas-
ter, yoʋr mina has made
ten minas more.’ 17 The
king said to him, ‘Well
done, good servant! Be-
cause yoʋ have been faith-
ful in a very small mat-
ter, take authority over
ten cities.’ 18 The second
came and said, ‘Master,
yoʋr mina has made five
minas.’ 19 The king said to
him, ‘Yoʋ are to be over

came and said, ‘Master,

I was afraid of yoʋ, be-
cause yoʋ are a stern man.
Yoʋ take out what yoʋ did
not put in, and yoʋ reap
what yoʋ did not §sow.’
22 The king said to him, ‘I
will condemn yoʋ by the
words coming out of yoʋr

vant. Yoʋ knew, did yoʋ,
that I was a stern man,

to those standing nearby,
‘Take the mina from him
and give it to the one who
has ten minas.’ 25 (But
they said to him, ‘Mas-
ter, he has ten minas!’)
26 ‘†For I tell you that ev-
eryone who has will be
given more, but the one
who does not have, even
what he has will be taken
away ‡from him. 27 But
as for those enemies of
mine who did not want me
to reign over them, bring
them here and slay them
in front of me.’ ”
The Triumphal Entry
After saying these
things, Jesus continued on
his way up to Jerusalem,
walking ahead of his disci-
ples. 29 As he drew near to
§Bethsphage and Bethany,
at the mount called Olivet,
he sent two of *his disciples
ahead, 30 saying, “Go into
the village ahead of you.
As you enter it, you will
find a colt tied, on which
no one has ever sat. Untie
it and bring it here. 31 If
anyone asks you, ‘Why
are you untying it?’ †tell
him this: ‘The Lord has
need of it.’ ” 32 So those
who were sent went off
and found ‡it just as he
had told them. 33 As they
were untying the colt, its
28
owners said to them, “Why
are you untying the colt?”
34 They said, “The Lord has
need of it.” 35 Then they
brought the colt to Jesus,
threw their garments over
it, and set Jesus on it. 36 As
he went along, people were
spreading their garments on
the road. 37 And as he drew
near to the descent of the
Mount of Olives, the whole
multitude of the disciples
began to praise God joyfully
with a loud voice for all
the miracles they had seen,
38 saying,
“Blessed is the king
who comes in the name of
the Lord!
Peace in heaven,
and glory in the highest!”
39 But some of the Pharisees
from among the crowd said
to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke
40 In re-
yoʋr disciples.”

“I tell you, if they keep
silent, the stones will cry

Jerusalem and saw the city,
he wept over it, 42 saying, “If

Jesus Cleanses the Temple
45 Then Jesus entered the
temple courts and began
driving out those who were
selling ‡and buying there.
46 He said to them, “It is
written, ‘My house §is a
house of prayer,’ but you
have made it a den of
robbers.”
47 Every day Jesus was
teaching in the temple
courts, but the chief priests
and the scribes were seeking
to destroy him, and so
were the prominent leaders
among the people. 48 But
they could not figure out
what to do, for all the people
were hanging on his every
word as they listened to him.
the scribes came with the
elders 2 and said to him, “Tell
us, by what authority are
yoʋ doing these things, or
who is it that gave yoʋ this
authority?” 3 He answered
them, “I will also ask you
one question.
Tell me:
4 Did John's authority to
baptize come from heaven
or from men?” 5 So they
discussed it among them-
selves, saying, “If we say,
‘From heaven,’ he will say,

‘From men,’ all the people
will stone us, for they are

swered that they did not
know where it came from.
8 Then Jesus said to them,
“Neither will I tell you by
what authority I am doing
these things.”
The Parable of the Vine-
yard Owner
9 Then he began to tell
the people this parable: “A
man planted a vineyard,
leased it to farmers, and
left the country for a
long time. 10 At harvest
time he sent a servant

said, ‘What should I do? I

they saw him, the farm-

15 So they threw him out

him. What then will the
owner of the vineyard do
to them? 16 He will come
and destroy those farmers
and give the vineyard to
others.” When the people
heard this, they said, “Cer-

The Question About Pay-
ing Taxes to Caesar
20 So they watched him
and sent spies who pre-
tended to be sincere in order
to catch him in something
he said, so that they could
deliver him up to the ju-
risdiction and authority of
the governor. 21 The spies
asked him, “Teacher, we
know that yoʋ speak and
teach correctly, and that yoʋ
do not show partiality but
teach the way of God in
truth. 22 Is it lawful for us to
pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
23 But perceiving their crafti-
ness, Jesus said to them,
“†Why are you testing me?
24 Show me a denarius.
Whose image and inscrip-
tion does it have?” They
‡answered, “Caesar's.” 25 He
said to them, “Then render

are Caesar's, and to God

The Widow's Offering
1 Then Jesus looked up and
saw the rich putting their
gifts into the treasury. 2 He
also saw a poor widow there
putting in two small copper
coins. 3 So he said, “Truly
I say to you, this poor
widow has put in more
than all the others. 4 For
they have all put in gifts
*for God out of their abun-
dance, but she, out of her
poverty, has put in all that
she had to live on.”
Jesus Predicts the Destruc-
tion of the Temple
5 Then, as some were talk-
ing about how the temple
was adorned with beautiful
stones and gifts consecrated
to God, Jesus said, 6 “As
for these things that you
see, the days will come
in which there will not

things are about to take
place?” 8 He said, “See that
you are not led astray.
For many will come in my
name, saying, ‘I am he,’
and, ‘The time has drawn
near.’
Do not go after
them. 9 When you hear
of wars and uprisings, do
not be terrified, for these
things must first take
place, but the end will not
immediately follow.”
10 Then he said to them,
“Nation will rise up
against nation, and king-
dom against kingdom.
11 There will be great
‡earthquakes

vari-
ous places, along with
§famines and plagues.
There will also be ter-

The
Destruction
Jerusalem
of
“When
you
see
Jerusalem
surrounded
by armies, know that
its desolation is near.
21 Then those who are in
Judea must flee to the
mountains,
those who
are in the city must get
out, and those who are
in the countryside must
not enter the city. 22 For
those will be days of
vengeance, to fulfill all
that is written. 23 Woe
to those who are with
child and to those who are
nursing infants in those
days! §For there will be
great distress in the land
and wrath against this
people. 24 They will fall by
the edge of the sword and
be led captive into all the
nations, and Jerusalem
will be trampled by
the Gentiles until *the
times of the Gentiles are
fulfilled.
20
The Coming of the Son of
Man
25 “There will be signs in
the sun, moon, and stars,
and on the earth there
will be distress among
the nations as they are
perplexed by the roar-
ing sea and the surging
waves. 26 People will faint
from fear and foreboding
of what is coming upon
the world, for the pow-
ers of the heavens will be
shaken. 27 Then they will
see the Son of Man coming
in a cloud with power and
great glory. 28 So when
these things begin to take
place, stand tall and lift
up your heads, for your
redemption is near.”
The Lesson of the Fig Tree
Then he told them a
parable: “Consider the fig
tree and all the other
trees. 30 As soon as they
sprout leaves, you can see
for yourselves and know
that summer is near. 31 So
also, when you see these
things taking place, know
that the kingdom of God
is near. 32 Truly I say to
you, this generation will
certainly not pass away
until all things have taken
place. 33 Heaven and earth
will pass away, but my
words will certainly not
pass away.

37 Each day Jesus taught
in the temple courts, but
at night he would go out
and stay at the mount called
Olivet. 38 And all the people
would come to him early in
the morning to listen to him
†in the temple courts.

22
The Plot to Kill Jesus
Now the Feast of Un-
leavened Bread was draw-
ing near, which is called
Passover, 2 and the chief
priests and the scribes were
looking for a way to get
rid of Jesus quietly, for they
were afraid of the people.
3 Then Satan entered into
Judas, the one called Is-
cariot, who was numbered
among the twelve. 4 He went
away and discussed with the
1
chief *priests and officers
how he might deliver Jesus
up to them. 5 They were
glad and agreed to give him
money. 6 So he accepted
the offer and began looking
for an opportunity to deliver
Jesus up to them in the ab-
sence of a crowd.
The Preparation of the
Passover
7 Then came the day for
the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, when the Passover
lamb had to be sacrificed.
8 Jesus sent Peter and John,
saying, “Go prepare the
Passover for us, so that
we may eat it.” 9 They said
to him, “Where do yoʋ want
us to prepare it?” 10 He said
to them, “Behold, when
you enter the city, a man
carrying a jug of water
will meet you. Follow him
into the house he enters
11 and say to the master of
the house, ‘The Teacher
asks yoʋ, “Where is the
guest room where I may
eat the Passover with my
disciples?” ’ 12 He will then
show you a large upper
room that is furnished;
prepare it there.” 13 So
they went and found it just
as Jesus had told them, and
they prepared the Passover.

after giving thanks he said,
“Take this and divide it

I tell you, *I will certainly
not drink again from the
fruit of the vine until the

19 Then he took bread, and
when he had given thanks,
he broke it and gave it to
them, saying, “This is my
body, which is given for
you. Do this in remem-
brance of me.” 20 In the
same way, he also took the
cup after they had eaten
supper, saying, “This cup
is the new covenant in
my blood, which is poured
out for you. 21 But behold,
the hand of the one who
is going to betray me is
with mine on the table.
22 †The Son of Man indeed

termined, but woe to that

to discuss with one another
‡ 22:16 again ¦ — CT
which one of them it could
be who would do this.
The Dispute About Great-
ness
24 A dispute also arose
among them as to which of
them was considered to be
25 So Jesus said
greater.
to them, “The kings of
the Gentiles exercise lord-
ship over them, and those
who have authority over
them are called benefac-
tors. 26 But it must not
be so with you; rather the
greatest among you must
become like the youngest,
and the leader must be-
come like one who serves.
27 For who is greater? The
one who reclines at the ta-
ble or the one who serves?
Is it not the one who re-
clines at the table? But I
am among you as one who
serves.
28 “You have stayed with
me in my trials. 29 And
I bestow on you a king-
dom, just as my Father
bestowed one on me, 30 so
that you may eat and
drink at my ‡table. And
you will sit on thrones

of §Israel.”

Jesus Prays on the Mount
of Olives
39 Then Jesus went out
and made his way to the
Mount of Olives, as was his
custom, and §his disciples
followed him. 40 When he
came to the place, he said to
them, “Pray that you may
not enter into tempta-
tion.” 41 Then he withdrew
from them about a stone's
throw away and knelt down
and prayed, 42 “Father, if

responded, “No more of

man's ear and healed him.
52 Then Jesus said to the chief
priests, the officers of the
temple, and the elders who
had come out against him,
“Have you come out with
swords and clubs as you
would against a robber?
53 I was with you daily in
the temple courts, and
you did not lay a hand
on me. But this is your
hour, when the power of

Peter Denies Jesus
54 Then they arrested him,
at him intently and said,
“This man also was with
him.” 57 But Peter denied
†him, saying, “Woman, I do

a little while, someone else
saw him and said, “Yoʋ also
are one of them.” But Pe-
ter said, “Man, I am not.”
59 After about an hour had
gone by, another man kept
insisting, “Truly this man
also was with him, for he too
is a Galilean.” 60 But Peter
said, “Man, I do not know
what yoʋ are talking about!”
And immediately, while he
was still speaking, ‡a rooster
crowed. 61 Then the Lord
turned and looked at Peter,
and Peter remembered what
the Lord had said to him,
“Before a rooster §crows,
yoʋ will deny me three
times.” 62 And Peter went
out and wept bitterly.

led Jesus †up to their San-

he said to them, “If I tell

the Son of Man will be

they all said, “Are yoʋ then

them, “You yourselves say

said, “What further need do

we ourselves have heard it

Jesus Brought Before Pi-
late
1 Then the whole assem-
bly arose and led Jesus to
Pilate. 2 They began to ac-
cuse him, saying, “We found
this man perverting *the na-
tion and forbidding us to
pay taxes to Caesar, declar-
ing himself to be Christ, a
king.” 3 So Pilate asked Je-
sus, “Are yoʋ the king of
the Jews?” Jesus answered
him, “Yoʋ have said it
yoʋrself.” 4 Then Pilate said
to the chief priests and the
crowd, “I find no fault in
this man.” 5 But they kept
insisting, “He stirs up the
people, teaching throughout
all Judea. He started from
Galilee and has come even to
this place.”
Jesus

Herod
6 When
Pilate heard
†mention of Galilee, he asked
whether the man was a
Galilean. 7 And when he
found out that Jesus was
under Herod's jurisdiction,
he sent him over to Herod,
who was also in Jerusalem
in those days. 8 When Herod
saw Jesus he was very glad,
for he had long desired to
see him, because he had
heard ‡many things about
him and was hoping to see
him perform some sign. 9 So
he questioned him at great
length, but Jesus gave him
no answer. 10 Meanwhile,
the §chief priests and
the scribes stood there,
vehemently accusing him.
11 Herod also treated him
with contempt and mocked
him, as did his soldiers.
Then, after dressing Jesus
in fine clothing, Herod sent
him back to Pilate. 12 That
very day *Pilate and Herod
became friends with one
another; before this they
had been enemies.
The Crowd Calls For Jesus'
Crucifixion

gether the chief priests, the
rulers, and the people, 14 and
said to them, “You brought

was misleading the people.
And behold, after examining
him before you, I have found
no fault in this man with
respect to the accusations
you are making against him,
15 and neither has Herod, for
†I sent you to him. Clearly
he has done nothing that
deserves death. 16 Therefore
I will have him flogged and
then release him.”
17 ‡Now each year at the
feast Pilate was obligated
to release one prisoner for
the people. 18 So they all
cried out together, “Away
with this man, and release
for us Barabbas!” 19 (This
was a man who had been
thrown into prison for an
insurrection that had taken
place in the city, and for
murder.) 20 Wishing to re-
lease Jesus, Pilate addressed
them again, 21 but they kept
on shouting, “Crucify, cru-
cify him!” 22 A third time he
said to them, “Why? What
evil has he done? I have
found in him §no grounds
for death. So I will have
him flogged and then re-
lease him.” 23 But they con-
tinued insistently with loud
voices, demanding that he
be crucified, and their voices
*prevailed, along with those
of the chief priests. 24 So
Pilate rendered his deci-
sion that their demand be
granted. 25 He †released the
man they had been asking
for, who had been thrown
into prison for insurrection
and murder, but he handed
Jesus over to their will.
The Crucifixion
26 As the soldiers led him
away, they took hold of Si-
mon, a Cyrenian man who
was coming in from the
countryside, and they laid
on him the cross, forcing
him to carry it behind Jesus.
27 A great multitude of peo-
ple followed along behind,
including women who were
mourning and lamenting for
Jesus. 28 But Jesus turned
to them and said, “Daugh-
ters of Jerusalem, do not
weep for me, but weep for
yourselves and for your
children. 29 For behold,
the days are coming when
people will say, ‘Blessed
are the barren, the wombs
that have not given birth,
and the breasts that have
not ‡nursed!’ 30 Then they
will begin to say to the
mountains, ‘Fall on us!’
and to the hills, ‘Cover

things when the wood is

The Burial of Jesus
50 Now there was a good
and righteous man named
Joseph, who was a member
of the council 51 but had not
consented to their decision
and action. He was from
Arimathea, a town of the
Jews, and was †himself also
waiting for the kingdom of
God. 52 He went to Pilate
and asked for Jesus' body.
53 Then he took it down,
wrapped it in a linen cloth,
and laid it in a tomb hewn
in the rock, where no one
had ever been laid. 54 It was
the day of Preparation, and
the Sabbath was approach-
ing. 55 The women who had
come with Jesus from Galilee
followed along behind and
saw the tomb and how his
body was laid in it. 56 Then
they returned and prepared
spices and ointments. But
they rested on the Sabbath

ment.

but is risen. Remember how
he told you, while he was
still in Galilee, 7 that the Son
of Man must be delivered

men, be crucified, and on

10 It was Mary Magdalene,
Joanna, Mary the mother of

things to the apostles. 11 But
§their words came across
to them as nonsense, and
they did not believe them.
12 Peter, however, got up and
ran to the tomb. When he
stooped down to look in, he
saw *the linen cloths lying

God and all the people,
20 and how the chief priests

over to a sentence of death
and crucified him. 21 But
we had hoped that he was
the one who would redeem
Israel. *And besides all this,
†today is now the third day
since these things happened.
22 Moreover, some of our
women amazed us. They

said to them, “O foolish
men, how slow of heart
you are to believe all that
the prophets have spoken!
26 Was it not necessary for
the Christ to suffer these
things and enter into his
glory?” 27 And beginning
from Moses and all the
Prophets, he explained to
them the things written
about himself in all the
Scriptures.
28 As
they drew near to
the village where they were
going, Jesus acted as though
he were going on farther.
29 But they urged him not
to do so, saying, “Stay with
us, for it is nearly evening,
and the day ‡is drawing to
a close.” So he went in to
stay with them. 30 As he was
reclining at the table with
them, he took the bread,
blessed and broke it, and
gave it to them. 31 Then their
eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, but he dis-
appeared from their sight.
32 They said to each other,

they rose that very hour
and returned to Jerusalem,
where they found the eleven

44 Then he said to them,
“These are ‡the words that
I spoke to you while I
was still with you, that ev-
erything written about me
in the Law of Moses, the
Prophets, and the Psalms

he opened their minds to

46 and said to them, “Thus

out, “This is he *of whom
I said, ‘He who comes af-

have all received, even grace

Jesus Calls His First Disci-
ples
35 On the next day John
was again standing with two
of his disciples. 36 As Jesus
walked by, John looked at
him and said, “Behold, the
Lamb of God.” 37 When the
two disciples heard him say
this, they followed Jesus.
38 Turning around, Jesus
saw them following him and
said to them, “What do
you seek?” They said to
him, “Rabbi” (which means
“Teacher”), “where are yoʋ
staying?” 39 He said to them,
“†Come and see.” So they
went and saw where he
was staying, and stayed with
him that day; it was about
the tenth hour. 40 Andrew,
the brother of Simon Peter,
was one of the two who
heard this from John and
followed Jesus. 41 Andrew
first found his own brother
Simon and said to him, “We
have found the Messiah”
(which means “Christ”),
42 and he brought Simon to
Jesus. Jesus looked at him
and said, “Yoʋ are Simon
the son of ‡Jonah; yoʋ
shall be called Cephas”
(which means “Peter”).
The Lamb of God
the next day John
saw Jesus coming to him and
said, “Behold, the Lamb of
God, who takes away the
sin of the world! 30 This is
he of whom I said, ‘After
me comes a man who ranks
ahead of me, because he ex-

did not know him, but I
came baptizing with water

speaking about the temple of

had said †this, and they be-
lieved the Scripture and the
word that Jesus had spoken.
Jesus Cleanses the TempleJesus Knows What Is in
Man
23 While Jesus was in
Jerusalem during the feast of
the Passover, many believed
in his name because they
saw the signs he was doing.
24 But Jesus did not entrust
himself to them, for he knew
all men. 25 He did not need
anyone to testify about man,
for he himself knew what
was in man.
this in Cana of Galilee as the
first of his signs. He revealed
his glory, and his disciples
believed in him.
12 After this he went down
to Capernaum with his
mother, his brothers, and
his disciples, and they stayed
there for a few days.
Now the Passover of
the Jews was near, so Jesus
went up to Jerusalem. 14 In
the temple courts he found
those who were selling oxen,
sheep, and doves, and he
also found the money chang-
ers sitting at their tables.
15 So he made a whip of
cords and drove them all
out of the temple courts,
along with their sheep and
oxen. He also poured out the
coins of the money changers
and overturned their tables.
16 Then he said to those who
were selling doves, “Take
these things away from
here; do not make my
Father's house a house of
trade.” 17 And his disci-
ples remembered that it is
written, “Zeal for yoʋr house
*will consume me.”
18 In response the Jews
said to him, “What sign
can yoʋ show us to prove
yoʋr authority to do these
things?” 19 Jesus answered
them, “Destroy this tem-
ple, and in three days I
will raise it up.” 20 The

Nicodemus
1 Now there was a man of
the Pharisees named Nicode-
mus, a ruler of the Jews.
2 He came to Jesus by night
and said to him, “Rabbi, we
know that yoʋ are a teacher
who has come from God, for
no one can do these signs
that yoʋ are doing unless
God is with him.” 3 Jesus an-
swered him, “Truly, truly,
I say to yoʋ, unless one
is born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God.”
4 Nicodemus said to him,
“How can a person be born

Man be lifted up, 15 so that
everyone who believes in
him should †not perish but
have eternal life.
16 “For God loved the
world in this way: He gave
his one and only Son, so
that whoever believes in
him should not perish but
have eternal life. 17 For
God did not send ‡his Son
into the world to condemn
the world, but so that
the world might be saved
through him. 18 Whoever
believes in him is not
condemned, but whoever
does not believe has been
condemned already, be-
cause he has not believed
in the name of the one and
only Son of God. 19 This
is the judgment: The light
has come into the world,
but people loved the dark-
ness rather than the light
because their works were
evil. 20 For whoever does
evil hates the light and
does not come to the light,
so that his works may not
be exposed. 21 But who-
ever lives by the truth
comes to the light, so that
it may be evident that his
works have been done in
God.”

John was also bap-

25 Now a discussion arose

Jesus Speaks with a
Samaritan Woman
1 Now when *the Lord
learned that the Pharisees
heard he was making and
baptizing more disciples
than John 2 (although it
was not Jesus himself who
baptized them, but his
disciples), 3 he left Judea
and went †away to Galilee.
4 But he had to pass through
Samaria. 5 So he came to
a town of Samaria called
Sychar, near the plot of land
that Jacob had given to his
son Joseph. 6 Jacob's well
was there, so Jesus, wearied
as he was from the journey,
sat by the well. It was about
the sixth hour.
7 When a woman from
Samaria came to draw wa-
ter, Jesus said to her, “Give
me some water to drink.”
8 (For his disciples had gone

9 So the Samaritan woman
said to him, “How is it that
yoʋ, being a Jew, ask for
water to drink from me, a

swered her, “If yoʋ knew
the gift of God and who
it is that is saying to yoʋ,
‘Give me some water to
drink,’ yoʋ would have
asked him, and he would
have given yoʋ living wa-
ter.” 11 The woman said to
him, “Sir, yoʋ do not even
have a bucket to draw with,
and the well is deep. Where
then can yoʋ get this living
water? 12 Are yoʋ greater
than our father Jacob, who
gave us this well and drank
from it himself, as did his
sons and livestock?” 13 Jesus
answered her, “Everyone
who drinks this water will
thirst again, 14 but who-
ever drinks the water I
give him will certainly
never thirst again. On the
contrary, the water I give
him will become in him
a spring of water welling
up to eternal life.” 15 The
woman said to him, “Sir,

woman said to him, “Sir, I
see that yoʋ are a prophet.
20 Our fathers worshiped
on this mountain, but you
say that the place where
people must worship is in
Jerusalem.” 21 Jesus said to
her, “Woman, believe me,
an hour is coming when
neither on this mountain
nor in Jerusalem will you
worship the Father. 22 You
worship what you do not
know; we worship what
we know, because salva-
tion is from the Jews.
23 But an hour is com-
ing, and is now here,
when the true worshipers
will worship the Father in
spirit and truth, for the
Father seeks such people
to worship him. 24 God
is spirit, and those who
worship him must wor-
ship in spirit and truth.”
25 The woman said to him,
“I know that Messiah is com-
ing” (who is called Christ).
“When he comes, he will
explain everything to us.”
26 Jesus said to her, “I who
speak to yoʋ am he.”
16 Jesus said to her, “Go

come back here.” 17 The
woman ‡answered, “I have

Jesus said

the woman left her water

the Samaritans came to him,
they asked him to stay with
them, and he stayed there
for two days. 41 And many
more believed because of his
word. 42 So they said to
the woman, “It is no longer
because of yoʋr report that
we believe, for we ourselves
have heard, and we know
that this is truly ‡the Christ,
the Savior of the world.”
31 In the meantime the
disciples were urging him,
“Rabbi, eat.” 32 But he said
to them, “I have food to
eat that you do not know
about.” 33 So the disciples
said to one another, “Could

50 Jesus said to him, “Go;

the man believed what Jesus

52 So he asked them what

5 One man was there who
had been suffering in his dis-

6 When Jesus saw him lying

been in that condition for a
long time already, he said to
him, “Do yoʋ want to be

the man was made well, so
he picked up his mat and
began to walk.

who had been healed did
not know who it was, for Je-
sus had slipped away, since
there was a crowd in that
place.
14 After this Jesus found
the man in the temple courts
and said to him, “Behold,
yoʋ have become well;
do not sin anymore, lest
something worse happen
to yoʋ.” 15 Then the man
went and told the Jews that
it was Jesus who had made
him well. 16 So the Jews be-
gan persecuting Jesus ‡and
seeking to kill him, because
he was doing these things
on the Sabbath. 17 But Jesus
responded to them, “My Fa-
ther is still working even
now, and I too am work-
ing.” 18 So the Jews were
seeking all the more to kill
him, because not only was
he breaking the Sabbath, but
he was even calling God his
own Father, making himself
equal with God.
The Authority of the Son
Jesus responded to
them, “Truly, truly, I say
to you, the Son can do
nothing on his own, but
only what he sees the Fa-
ther doing.
For what-
ever the Father does, the
Son also does in the same

as the Father raises the
dead and gives them life,
so also the Son gives life
to whomever he wishes.
22 The Father judges no
one, but has given all
judgment to the Son, 23 so
that all may honor the
Son just as they honor the
Father. Anyone who does
not honor the Son does
not honor the Father who
sent him. 24 Truly, truly, I
say to you, whoever hears
my word and believes him
who sent me has eternal
life. He does not come
into judgment, but has
passed from death to life.
25 “Truly, truly, I say to
you, an hour is coming,
and is now here, when the
dead will hear the voice
of the Son of God, and
those who hear it will live.
26 For as the Father has
life in himself, so he has
granted the Son to have
life in himself. 27 And he
has given the Son author-
ity to execute judgment,
because he is the Son of
Man. 28 Do not be amazed
at this, because an hour is
coming in which all who
are in the tombs will hear
his voice 29 and come out,
those who have done good
to a resurrection of life,
and those who have done
evil to a resurrection of
judgment.

crowd was coming to him,
he said to Philip, “Where
shall we buy bread so that
these people may eat?”
6 (He said this to test him,
for he himself knew what he
was about to do.) 7 Philip
answered him, “Two hun-
dred denarii worth of bread
would not be sufficient for
each *of them to receive a
little portion.” 8 Then one
of his disciples, Andrew, the
brother of Simon Peter, said
to him, 9 “There is a lit-
tle boy here who has five
barley loaves and two fish,
but what good are they for
so many people?” 10 Jesus
said, “Have the people sit
down.” (Now there was a
lot of grass in that place.)
So the men sat down, about
five thousand in number.
11 Then Jesus took the loaves,
and after giving thanks, he
distributed them †to the dis-
ciples, and the disciples dis-
tributed them to those who
were seated.
He did the
same with the fish, and the
people ate as much as they
wanted. 12 When they were
full, Jesus said to his disci-
ples, “Gather together the
pieces that are left over
so that nothing is wasted.”
13 So they gathered them to-
gether and filled twelve bas-
kets with the broken pieces
from the five barley loaves
that were left over by those
who had eaten. 14 When
* 6:7 of them ¦ — CT

the people saw the ‡sign that
Jesus had done, they said,
“This is truly the Prophet
who is to come into the
world.” 15 So Jesus, knowing
that they were about to come
and take him by force to
make him king, §withdrew
to the mountain by himself.
Jesus Walks on Water
16 When evening came, his
disciples went down to the
sea, 17 and after getting into
*the boat, they started go-
ing across the sea to Ca-
pernaum. Darkness had al-
ready set in, but Jesus had
†not come to them. 18 Then
the sea became rough be-
cause a strong wind was
blowing. 19 When they had
rowed about three or four
miles, they saw Jesus ap-
proaching the boat, walking
on the sea, and they were
afraid. 20 But he said to
them, “It is I; do not be
afraid.” 21 Then they were
willing to receive him into
the boat, and immediately
the boat reached the land
where they were heading.
I Am the Bread of Life
On the next day the
crowd that had stayed on the
other side of the sea realized
that there had been no other
boat there except ‡the one
Jesus' disciples had gotten
into, and that Jesus himself
had not gotten into the boat

his disciples had gone away
alone. 23 §Then other boats
from Tiberias came near the
place where they had eaten

given thanks. 24 So when
the crowd saw that neither

there, they themselves got

just as it is written, ‘He gave
them bread from heaven
to eat.’ ” 32 Jesus said to
them, “Truly, truly, I say
to you, it was not Moses
who gave you the bread
from heaven, but my
Father gives you the true
bread from heaven. 33 For
the bread of God is that
which comes down from
heaven and gives life to
the world.” 34 So they said
to him, “Sir, give us this
bread always.”
35 Jesus said to them, “I
am the bread of life; he
who comes to me will
never hunger, and he who
believes in me will never
thirst. 36 But as I told
you, you have seen me
and still you do not be-

39 And this is the will of

should raise them up on

on the other side of the sea,
they said to him, “Rabbi,

26 Jesus answered them,
“Truly, truly, I say to you,

because you saw signs,
but because you ate the
loaves and were filled.
27 Do not work for food
that perishes, but for food
that endures to eternal
life, which the Son of Man
will give you. For on him
God the Father has set his
seal.” 28 Then they said to
him, “What must we do to do
the works of God?” 29 Jesus
answered them, “This is
the work of God, that
you believe in the one
he has sent.” 30 So they
said to him, “What sign then

the bread that I will give

52 Then the Jews began to
quarrel with one another,
saying, “How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?”
53 So Jesus said to them,
“Truly, truly, I say to
you, if you do not eat the
flesh of the Son of Man
and drink his blood, you
have no life in yourselves.
54 Whoever eats my flesh
and drinks my blood has

eats my flesh and drinks

Father, so whoever feeds

to them, “Does this offend

before? 63 It is the Spirit
who gives life; the flesh is

that I †speak to you are

are some among you who
do not believe.” (For Je-
sus knew from the begin-
ning which of them did not
believe and who it was that
would betray him.) 65 Then
he said, “That is why I
told you that no one can
come to me unless it has
been granted to him by
‡my Father.”
66 At
that point many of
his disciples went back and
no longer walked with him.
67 So Jesus said to the twelve,
“Do you also want to go
away?” 68 Simon Peter an-
swered him, “Lord, to whom
shall we go? Yoʋ have the
words of eternal life. 69 And
we have come to believe and
to know that yoʋ are the

them, “Did I not choose

The Unbelief of Jesus'
Brothers
1 After this Jesus went
from place to place in
Galilee, for he did not
want to travel around in
Judea because the Jews
were seeking to kill him.
2 Now the Jewish Feast of
Tabernacles was near. 3 So
Jesus' brothers said to him,
“Leave here and go to Judea
so that yoʋr disciples may
see the works yoʋ are doing.
4 For no one does anything
in secret while seeking to
be known publicly. If yoʋ
are going to do these things,
show yoʋrself to the world.”
5 (For not even his brothers
believed in him.) 6 So Jesus
said to them, “My time has
not yet come, but your
time is always at hand.
7 The world cannot hate
you, but it does hate me
because I testify that its
works are evil. 8 You go up
to *this feast; I am not †yet

this ‡to them, he remained
in Galilee.

were looking for him at the
feast, saying, “Where is that
man?” 12 And there was
much murmuring about him
among the crowds. Some
were saying, “He is a good
man.” Others were saying,
“No, he is deceiving the
crowd.” 13 No one, however,
was speaking openly about
him for fear of the Jews.

14 Midway through the
feast, Jesus went up to the
temple courts and began to

answered them, “My teach-

25 Now
some of the peo-

Could it be that the rulers

we know where this man is

Jesus cried out as he taught
in the temple courts, “You
know me and you know
where I am from. Yet I
have not come on my own
authority, but he who sent
me is true. You do not
know him, 29 but I know
him, because I have come
from him, and he sentTHE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN 7:30 192 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN 7:48

ing to arrest him, but no one
laid a hand on him, because
his hour had not yet come.
31 Still, many from among
the crowd believed in him
and said, “When the Christ
comes, will he do more signs
than this man has done?”
You Will Seek Me But Not
Find Me
32 The Pharisees heard
the crowd murmuring these
things about him, so the
*Pharisees and the chief
priests sent officers to arrest
him. 33 Then Jesus †said,
“I am with you for a lit-
tle while longer, and then
I am going to him who
sent me. 34 You will seek
me, but you will not find
me; and where I am, you
cannot come.” 35 Then the
Jews said to one another,
“Where is this man about
to go that we will not find
him? Is he about to go to
the Jews who are scattered
among the Greeks and teach
the Greeks? 36 What does he
mean by saying, ‘You will
seek me, but you will not
find me; and where I am,
you cannot come’?”
said, ‘From his innermost
being will flow rivers of
living water.’ ” 39 (He said
this about the Spirit, whom
those who believed in him
were going to receive, for
the ‡Holy Spirit had not yet
been given, because Jesus
had not yet been glorified.)
The People Are Divided
over Jesus
40 When they heard §this,
*many from among the
crowd were saying, “Surely
this man is the Prophet.”
41 Others were saying, “He
is the Christ.” But †others
were saying, “No, for the
Christ does not come from
Galilee, does he? 42 Does
not the Scripture say that
the Christ will come from
David's descendants and
from Bethlehem, the town
where David lived?” 43 So
a division arose among the
crowd because of Jesus.
44 Some of them wanted to
arrest him, but no one laid a
hand on him.
The Unbelief of the Jewish
Leaders

to the chief priests and Phar-

answered, “Never has any-

said to him, “Where is yoʋr

Jesus answered,
“You neither know me nor

them, “When you lift up

that I do nothing on my

these things just as *my

himself and went out from
the temple grounds. §And

long as I am in the world,
I am the light of the

he spit on the ground and
made mud with the saliva.
Then he †rubbed the mud on
the blind man's eyes 7 and
said to him, “Go wash in
the pool of Siloam” (which
means “Sent”). So he went
and washed, and came away
seeing. 8 Then his neighbors
and those who had previ-
ously seen that he was ‡blind
were saying, “Is this not the
man who used to sit and
beg?” 9 Others were say-
ing, “It is he.” §Still oth-
ers were saying, “He is like
him.” But he kept saying, “I
am he.” 10 So they said to
him, “*How were yoʋr eyes
opened?” 11 He answered,
“†A man named Jesus made
mud, rubbed it on my eyes,
and said to me, ‘Go to ‡the
pool of Siloam and wash.’
So I went and washed, and
received my sight.” 12 They
said to him, “Where is this
man?” He said, “I do not
know.”

found the man and said §to
him, “Do yoʋ believe in

answered, “Who is he, Lord,

37 Jesus said to him, “Yoʋ

shiped him. 39 Then Jesus
said, “For judgment I have
come into this world, so
that those who do not see
may see, and those who
see may become blind.”
40 Some of the Pharisees who
were with him heard this
and said to him, “We are not
also blind, are we?” 41 Jesus
said to them, “If you were
blind, you would have no
sin, but now †you say, ‘We

the sheep follow him be-
cause they recognize his
voice. 5 They will certainly
not follow a stranger, but
will flee from him because
they do not recognize the
voice of strangers.” 6 Jesus
spoke to them with this fig-
ure of speech, but they did
not understand what he was
saying to them.
4 When
I Am the Good Shepherd
Jesus said ‡to them
again, “Truly, truly, I say
to you, I am the gate for
the sheep. 8 All who came
§before are thieves and
robbers, but the sheep did
not listen to them. 9 I am
the gate; if anyone enters
through me, he will be
saved and will come in

ture. 10 The thief comes
only to steal, kill, and

lays down his life for the
sheep. 12 But the hired

the sheep. So when he
sees the wolf coming, he
leaves the sheep and flees,
and the wolf snatches the

Shepherd
1 “Truly, truly, I say to
you, he who does not en-

gate but climbs in by an-
other way is a thief and
a robber. 2 But he who
enters by the gate is the
shepherd of the sheep.
3 The gatekeeper opens
the gate for him, and the
sheep hear his voice. He
calls his own sheep by
name and leads them out.

13 *The hired hand flees,
for he is a hired hand
and does not care about
the sheep. 14 I am the
good shepherd. I know my
sheep and my sheep know
me, 15 even as the Father
knows me and I know the
Father.
I lay down my
life for the sheep. 16 I
have other sheep that are
not of this fold. I must
bring them also, and they
will hear my voice. And
†there will be one flock,
one shepherd. 17 This is
why the Father loves me,
because I lay down my life
so that I may take it up
again. 18 No one takes it
from me, but I lay it down
of my own accord. I have
authority to lay it down,
and I have authority to
take it up again.
I re-
ceived this commandment
from my Father.”
19 At these words there
was again a division among
the Jews. 20 Many of them
were saying, “He has a
demon and is out of his
mind; why do you listen to
him?” 21 Others were saying,
“These are not the words
of a man possessed by a
demon. Can a demon open
the eyes of the blind?”
22 ‡Now it was the Feast of
the Dedication in Jerusalem.
It was winter, 23 and Je-
sus was walking in the tem-
ple courts, in Solomon's Por-
tico. 24 So the Jews gathered
around him and said to him,
“How long are yoʋ going to
keep us in suspense?
If
yoʋ are the Christ, tell us
plainly.” 25 Jesus answered
them, “I did tell you, but
you do not believe. The
works that I do in my Fa-
ther's name testify about
me, 26 but you do not be-
lieve because you are not
among my §sheep, just as I
told you. 27 My sheep hear
my voice; I know them,
and they follow me. 28 I
give them eternal life, and
they will certainly never
perish, and no one will
snatch them out of my
hand. 29 *My Father, who
has given them to me, is
greater than all, and no
one is able to snatch them
out of †my Father's hand.
30 I and the Father are
one.”
31 Then the Jews picked up
stones again to stone him.
32 In response Jesus said to
them, “I have shown you
many good works from
‡my Father; for which of
these works are you going
to stone me?” 33 The Jews

work, but for blasphemy,
and because yoʋ, being a
man, make yoʋrself out to
be God.” 34 Jesus answered
them, “Is it not written
in your law, ‘I said, you
are gods’? 35 If he called
them ‘gods,’ to whom the
word of God came (and
the Scripture cannot be
broken), 36 do you say of
him whom the Father con-
secrated and sent into the
world, ‘Yoʋ are blasphem-
ing,’ because I said, ‘I am
the Son of God’? 37 If I
do not do the works of
my Father, do not believe
me. 38 But if I do them,
even if you do not believe
me, believe the works, so
that you may know and
§believe that the Father
is in me and I in *him.”
39 Again they sought to ar-
rest him, but he eluded their
grasp.
40 Then Jesus went away
again to the other side of the
Jordan, to the place where
John had been baptizing at
first, and he stayed there.
41 Many came to him and
were saying, “John did no
sign, but everything that
John said about this man
was true.” 42 And many of
the people there believed in
him.

The Death of Lazarus
1 Now a man named
Lazarus was sick. He was
from Bethany, the village of
Mary and her sister Martha.
2 (Mary was the one who
anointed the Lord with
ointment and wiped his feet
with her hair; it was her
brother Lazarus who was
sick.) 3 So the sisters sent
word to Jesus, “Lord, behold,
the one yoʋ love is sick.”
4 But when Jesus heard this,
he said, “This sickness will
not end in death but is
for the glory of God, so
that the Son of God may
be glorified through it.”
5 Now Jesus loved Martha,
her sister, and Lazarus.
6 But when he heard that
Lazarus was sick, he stayed
where he was for two more
days. 7 After that he said
to the disciples, “Let us go
8 The
to Judea again.”
disciples said to him, “Rabbi,
the Jews were just now
seeking to stone yoʋ, and yet
you are going there again?”
9 Jesus
answered, “Are
there not twelve hours in
the day? If anyone walks
in the day, he does not
stumble, because he sees
the light of this world.
10 But if anyone walks in
the night, he stumbles,
because the light is not
in him.” 11 After saying
this, he said to them, “Our
friend Lazarus has fallen
asleep, but I am going
there to wake him up.”
12 *His disciples said, “Lord,

thought Jesus was speaking
about natural sleep, but he
was actually speaking about
14 Then
Lazarus' death.)
Jesus told them plainly,
“Lazarus has died, 15 and I
rejoice for your sake that
I was not there, so that
you may believe. But let
us go to him.” 16 Then
Thomas (called Didymus)
said to his fellow disciples,
“Let us go too, so that we
may die with him.”
I Am the Resurrection and
the Life
17 When Jesus arrived, he
found that Lazarus had been
in the tomb for four days
18 Now Bethany
already.
was near Jerusalem, about
two miles away, 19 and
many of the Jews had joined
†the women who were with
Martha and Mary, to console
them about their brother.
20 When Martha heard that
Jesus was coming, she went
to meet him, but Mary re-
mained seated in the house.
21 Then Martha said to Jesus,
“Lord, if yoʋ had been here,
my brother would not have
died. 22 ‡But even now I
know that God will give yoʋ
whatever yoʋ ask of him.”
23 Jesus said to her, “Yoʋr
brother will rise again.”
24 Martha said to him, “I
know that he will rise again
in the resurrection on the
last day.” 25 Jesus said to
her, “I am the resurrec-
tion and the life. He who
believes in me, though he
may die, yet shall he live.
26 No one who lives and
believes in me will ever
die. Do yoʋ believe this?”
27 She said to him, “Yes,
Lord, I have come to believe
that yoʋ are the Christ, the
Son of God, who is to come
into the world.”
Jesus Weeps
saying this, she
went and called her sis-
ter Mary, saying in pri-
vate, “The Teacher is here
and is calling for yoʋ.”
29 When Mary heard this,
she rose quickly and went
to him. 30 (Now Jesus had
not yet come into the vil-
lage, but §was in the place
where Martha had met him.)
31 When the Jews who were
in the house with Mary,
consoling her, saw her rise
quickly and go out, they
followed her, *saying, “She
is going to the tomb to
weep there.” 32 When Mary
came to where Jesus was
and saw him, she fell at
his feet and said to him,
“Lord, if yoʋ had been here,
my brother would not have
died.” 33 When Jesus saw
her weeping, and the Jews
who had come with her
also weeping, he was deeply
moved in his spirit and trou-
bled. 34 He said, “Where

have you laid him?” They
said to him, “Lord, come and
see.” 35 Jesus wept. 36 So
the Jews said, “See how he
loved him!” 37 But some
of them said, “Could not he
who opened the eyes of the
blind man have also kept
this man from dying?”
Jesus Raises Lazarus
Deeply moved once
more, Jesus came to the
tomb. (It was a cave, and
a stone was lying against it.)
39 Jesus said, “Take away
the stone.” Martha, the
sister of the man who had
died, said to him, “Lord,
there is already a stench, for
it is the fourth day.” 40 Jesus
said to her, “Did I not tell
yoʋ that if yoʋ believed
yoʋ would see the glory of
God?” 41 So they took away
the stone †from where the
dead man was laid. Then
Jesus lifted up his eyes and
said, “Father, I thank yoʋ
that yoʋ have heard me.
42 I know that yoʋ always
hear me, but I say this for
the benefit of the crowd
that is standing here, so
that they may believe that
43 After

saying this, he cried out
with a loud voice, “Lazarus,
44 Then the

man who had died came
out, his feet and his hands
bound with strips of cloth,
and his face wrapped in a
cloth. Jesus said to them,
38
“Unbind him, and let him
go.”
The Plot to Kill Jesus
45 Therefore many of the
Jews who had come to Mary,
and had seen what Jesus did,
believed in him. 46 But some
of them went to the Phar-
isees and told them ‡what
Jesus had done. 47 So the
chief priests and the Phar-
isees convened a meeting
of the Sanhedrin and said,
“What are we going to do?
For this man is doing many
signs. 48 If we allow him
to continue like this, every-
one will believe in him, and
the Romans will come and
take away our holy place
and our nation.” 49 But one
of them, Caiaphas, who was
high priest that year, said
to them, “You do not know
anything, 50 nor do you con-
sider that it is better for §us
to have one man die for
the people than to have the
whole nation perish.” 51 (He
said this not of his own ac-
cord, but being high priest
that year he prophesied that
Jesus was going to die for the
nation, 52 and not only for
the nation, but also to gather
into one the children of God
53 So
scattered abroad.)
from that day they plotted
*together to kill him.
54 Therefore
Jesus no
longer went around openly
among the Jews. Instead, he
departed from there to the
region near the wilderness,

to a town called Ephraim,
where he †spent time with
‡his disciples.
55 Now the Passover of the
Jews was near, and many
people went up to Jerusalem
from the countryside to pu-
rify themselves before the
Passover. 56 They were look-
ing for Jesus and saying to
one another as they stood
in the temple courts, “What
do you think? That he will
not come to the feast at all?”
57 (Now the chief priests and
the Pharisees had given §an
order that if anyone knew
where Jesus was, he should
report it, so that they might
arrest him.)
12
Simon's son, who was about
to betray him, said, 5 “Why
was this ointment not sold
for three hundred denarii
and the money given to the
poor?” 6 (He said this not
because he cared about the
poor, but because he was
a thief; he was the keeper
of the moneybag and would
pilfer what was put into
it.) 7 So Jesus said, “Leave
her ‡alone; she has kept
this ointment for the day
of my burial. 8 For you
always have the poor with
you, but you do not always
have me.”
The Plot to Kill Lazarus
Meanwhile §a large
crowd of the Jews found out
that Jesus was there, so they
came not only because of
Jesus but also to see Lazarus,
whom he had raised from
the dead. 10 So the chief
priests plotted to kill Lazarus
also, 11 because on account
of him many of the Jews
were going over to Jesus and
believing in him.
9
Mary Anoints Jesus' Feet
Six days before the
Passover, Jesus came to
Bethany, where Lazarus
was, *who had died and
whom Jesus had raised from
the dead. 2 They prepared
a supper for Jesus there.
Martha was serving, and

14 Finding
a young donkey,
Jesus sat on it, just as it is
written,
15 “Do not be afraid, daugh-
ter of Zion.
Behold, yoʋr king is coming,
sitting on a donkey's colt.”
16 (His disciples did not un-
derstand these things at first,
but when Jesus was glori-
fied, they remembered that
these things were written
about him, and that these
things had been done to
him.) 17 Now the crowd that
had been with him when
he called Lazarus out of
the tomb and raised him
from the dead was testifying

about it.
a crowd went out to meet
him, because they heard he
had done this sign. 19 So
the Pharisees said to one an-
other, “You see that you are
achieving nothing. Behold,
the world has gone after
him.”
Some Greeks Wish to See
Jesus
20 Now there were some
Greeks among those who
went up to worship at the
feast. 21 They came to Philip,
who was from Bethsaida of
Galilee, and requested of
him, “Sir, we would like to
see Jesus.” 22 Philip went
and told Andrew, †and in
turn Andrew and Philip told

them, “The hour has come
for the Son of Man to be
glorified. 24 Truly, truly,
I say to you, unless a
grain of wheat falls to
the ground and dies, it
remains alone; but if it
dies, it bears much fruit.
25 Whoever loves his life
‡will lose it, but whoever
hates his life in this world
will keep it for eternal
life. 26 If anyone wants to
serve me, he must follow
me; and where I am, there
will my servant be also.
If anyone serves me, the
Father will honor him.”
Jesus Speaks About His
Death
27 “My
soul is now
troubled. And what shall
I say? ‘Father, save me
from this hour’? No, it
is for this reason that I
have come to this hour.
28 Father,

Then a voice
came from heaven: “I have
glorified it, and will glorify

it again.”
crowd standing there heard
the voice, they said it was
thunder. Others said, “An
angel has spoken to him.”
30 Jesus responded, “This
voice has come not for my
sake, but for your sake.
31 Now is the judgment of
this world. Now the ruler
of this world will be cast
out. 32 And when I am

myself.” 33 (He said this to
indicate the kind of death
he was going to die.) 34 The
crowd responded to him,
“We have heard from the
law that the Christ remains
forever, so how can yoʋ say,
‘The Son of Man must be
lifted up’?
Who is this

said to them, “The light

that the darkness may
not overtake you.

have the light, believe in
the light, so that you may
become sons of light.”
The Unbelief of the People
After saying these things,
Jesus went away and
was hidden from them.
37 Although he had done
so many signs in their
presence, they did not
believe in him. 38 This was to
fulfill what had been spoken
by Isaiah the prophet:
“Lord, who has believed our
report?
And to whom has the arm
of the Lord been re-
vealed?”
39 For this reason they could
not believe, for again Isaiah
said,
40 “He has blinded their eyes
lest they should see with
their eyes
and understand with their
heart and turn *back,
and I would heal them.”
41 Isaiah
said these things
he saw the Lord's
glory and spoke about him.
42 Nevertheless, many even
among the rulers believed
in him, but because of the
Pharisees they would not
confess it, so that they would
not be put out of the syn-
agogue. 43 For they loved
the glory that comes from
men more than the glory
that comes from God.
†when
Jesus' Words Will Judge
the World
44 Then Jesus cried out and
said, “Whoever believes in
me, believes not in me
but in him who sent me.
45 And whoever sees me
sees him who sent me. 46 I
have come into the world
as light, so that no one
who believes in me should
remain in darkness. 47 If
anyone hears my words
and does not ‡believe, I
do not judge him; for I
did not come to judge the
world, but to save the
world. 48 He who rejects
me and does not receive
my words has a judge; the
word I have spoken will
judge him on the last day.
49 For I have not spoken
on my own authority, but
the Father who sent me
gave me a commandment
and hardened their hearts,

50 And I know that his com-
mandment leads to eter-
nal life. What I speak,
therefore, I speak just as

“Yoʋ shall never wash my
feet.” Jesus answered him,
“If I do not wash yoʋ, yoʋ
have no part with me.”
9 Simon Peter said to him,
“Lord, then wash not only
my feet, but also my hands

and my head.”
said to him, “He who has
bathed has no need to
wash, except for his feet,
but is completely clean.
And you are clean, but not
all of you.” 11 (For he knew
who would betray him; that
is why he said, “You are not
all clean.”)
12 When Jesus had washed
their feet and collected his
garments, he reclined again
at the table and said to them,
“Do you know what I have

Jesus Washes the Disci-
ples' Feet
1 Now before the feast of
the Passover, Jesus knew
that his hour had come to
depart from this world and
go to the Father. Having
loved his own who were in
the world, he loved them
to the end. 2 *By the time
supper ended, the devil had
put it into the heart of Ju-
das Iscariot, the son of Si-
mon, to betray Jesus. 3 Jesus
knew that the Father had
put all things into his hands,
and that he had come from
God and was going back
to God, 4 so he rose from
supper, laid aside his outer
garments, took a towel, and
wrapped it around his waist.
5 After that, he put water
into the washbasin and be-
gan to wash his disciples'
feet and to wipe them with
the towel that was wrapped
around his waist. 6 When
he came to Simon Peter,
Peter said to him, “Lord,
are yoʋ going to wash my
feet?” 7 Jesus answered him,
“What I am doing yoʋ do
not now understand, but
afterward yoʋ will under-
stand.” 8 Peter said to him,

table knew why he said
this to him. 29 Some were
thinking, since Judas had the
moneybag, that Jesus was
saying to him, “Buy what we
need for the feast,” or that
he should give something to
the poor.) 30 As soon as Judas
took the morsel, he went out.
And it was night.

answered, “It is the one to

after I have dipped it.”
§Then he dipped the morsel
and gave it to *Judas Iscariot,
the son of Simon. 27 After
Judas took the morsel, Satan
entered into him.

Jesus said to him, “What

Sorrow Will Turn to Joy
16 “In a little while you
is talking about.” 19 Jesus
knew that they wanted to
ask him about this, so he
said to them, “Are you ask-
ing one another what I
meant when I said, ‘In a
little while, you will not
see me; and again after a
little while, you will see
me’? 20 Truly, truly, I say
to you, you will weep and
lament, but the world will
rejoice. You will be sor-

will turn to joy. 21 When
a woman is giving birth,
she has pain because her

her baby is born, she no

guish because of her joy
that a child has been born
into the world. 22 So you
also have sorrow now, but
I will see you again, and
your hearts will rejoice,
and no one will take your
joy away from you. 23 In
that day you will ask noth-

Jesus lifted up his eyes to
heaven and said, “Father,

Jesus Arrested
1 After saying these things,
the word he had spoken: “I
have not lost a single one
of those yoʋ have given
me.” 10 Then Simon Peter,
who had a sword, drew
it, struck the high priest's
servant, and cut off his right
ear.
(The servant's name
was Malchus.) 11 But Jesus
said to Peter, “Put yoʋr
sword into its sheath;
shall I not drink the cup
that the Father has given
me?”
Jesus Brought Before An-
nas
12 Then the cohort of sol-
diers, along with its com-
mander and the Jewish of-
ficers, arrested Jesus, bound
him, 13 and led him *away
first to Annas, for he was the
father-in-law of Caiaphas,
who was high priest that
year. 14 (It was Caiaphas
who had advised the Jews
that it was better for one
man to †perish for the peo-
ple.)
Jesus went out with his
disciples across the Kidron
Valley, where there was a
garden, which he entered
along with his disciples.
2 Now Judas, who betrayed
him, also knew the place,
because Jesus had often
met there with his disciples.
3 So Judas took a cohort
of soldiers and officers
from the chief priests and
Pharisees, and they went
there with lanterns, torches,

and weapons.
Jesus, knowing everything
that would happen to him,
went out and said to them,
“Whom do you seek?”
5 They answered him, “Jesus

them, “I am he.” (Judas, following Jesus, as was ‡the

answered, “I told you that went out, spoke to the gate-
I am he. So if you are keeper, and brought Peter
seeking me, let these men in. 17 Then the servant girl

to Peter, “Yoʋ are not also
one of this man's disciples,
are yoʋ?” He said, “I am
not.” 18 (Now the servants
and the officers had made a
charcoal fire, because it was
cold, and they were standing
there warming themselves.
Peter was also standing with
them, warming himself.)
The High Priest Questions
Jesus
19 Meanwhile, the high
priest
questioned
Jesus
about his disciples and

his teaching.
answered him, “I have
spoken openly to the
world.
I have always
taught in the synagogues
and in the temple courts,
where §the Jews always
assemble together. I have
said nothing in secret.
21 Why do yoʋ question
me? Question those who
heard what I said to them.
Behold, they know what

I said.”
said this, one of the officers
standing nearby slapped
him and said, “Is that how
yoʋ answer the high priest?”
23 Jesus answered him, “If
I have spoken wrongly,
testify as to what was
wrong; but if I have
spoken well, why are yoʋ
hitting me?” 24 Then Annas
sent him bound to Caiaphas
the high priest.
25 Meanwhile, Simon Peter
was standing and warming
himself. So they said to him,
“Yoʋ are not also one of his
disciples, are yoʋ?” He de-
nied it and said, “I am not.”
26 But one of the servants of
the high priest, who was a
relative of the man whose
ear Peter had cut off, said,
“Did I not see yoʋ with him
27 Peter
in the garden?”
denied it again, and immedi-
ately a rooster crowed.
Jesus Brought Before Pi-
late
28 Then the Jews led Jesus
away from Caiaphas to the
governor's headquarters. It
was now early in the morn-
ing. They themselves did
not go into the governor's
headquarters so that they
would not be defiled, but
could eat the Passover. 29 So
Pilate went out to them and
said, “What accusation do
you bring against this man?”
30 They answered him, “If he
were not *an evildoer, we
would not have handed him
over to yoʋ.” 31 Pilate said
to them, “You take him and
judge him according to your
own law.” The Jews said
to him, “It is not lawful for
us to put anyone to death.”
32 (This happened to fulfill
what Jesus had said when he
indicated the kind of death
he was going to die.)
33 Then Pilate went into his
headquarters again, called

“Are yoʋ the king of the
Jews?” 34 Jesus answered
†him, “Do yoʋ say this
of yoʋr own accord, or
have others spoken to yoʋ
about me?” 35 Pilate an-
swered, “Am I a Jew? Yoʋr
own nation and the chief
priests have handed yoʋ
over to me. What have yoʋ
done?” 36 Jesus answered,
“My kingdom is not of this
world.
If my kingdom
were of this world, my
servants would be fighting
to keep me from being
delivered up to the Jews.
But as it is, my kingdom
is not from here.” 37 Pilate
said to him, “So yoʋ are
a king?” Jesus answered,
“Yoʋ have said yoʋrself
that I am a king.
The
reason I was born and the
reason I came into the
world is to testify to the
truth. Everyone who is
of the truth listens to my
voice.” 38 Pilate said to him,
“What is truth?”
The Crowd Calls For Jesus'
Crucifixion
After he said this, he again
went out to the Jews and
said to them, “I find no fault
in him. 39 But ‡you have
a custom that I release for
you one man at the Passover.
So do you want me to re-
lease for you the king of the
Jews?” 40 They §all cried
out again, “Not this man, but
Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas
was an insurrectionist.)

Then Pilate took Jesus

soldiers twisted together a
crown of thorns, put it on
his head, and then clothed
him with a purple garment.
3 They kept *saying, “Hail,
King of the Jews!” and strik-
ing him on the face. 4 Once
again Pilate came out and
said to the Jews, “Behold, I
am bringing him out to you
so that you may know that I
find no fault in him.” 5 Jesus
then came out wearing the
crown of thorns and the pur-
ple garment, and Pilate said
to them, “Behold, the man!”
6 When the chief priests and
the officers saw him, they
cried out, “Crucify, crucify
†him!”
But Pilate said to
them, “You take him and
crucify him, for I find no
fault in him.” 7 The Jews
answered him, “We have a
law, and according to ‡our
law he must die, for he made
himself out to be the Son of
God.”
8 When Pilate heard this,
he was even more afraid.
9 He went back into his
headquarters and said to Je-
sus, “Where are yoʋ from?”
But Jesus gave him no an-
swer. 10 So Pilate said to
him, “Yoʋ do not speak to
me? Do yoʋ not know that

I have authority to §crucify

“Yoʋ would have no au-
thority over me if it had
not been given to yoʋ
from above.
Therefore
he who handed me over
to yoʋ has greater sin.”
12 From that point forward
Pilate was seeking to release
him, but the Jews cried out,
“If yoʋ release this man, yoʋ
are not a friend of Caesar;
everyone who makes him-
self out to be a king opposes
Caesar.”
13 When Pilate heard †this,
he brought Jesus out and
sat down on the judgment
seat at a place called the
Stone Pavement (or in He-
brew, Gabbatha). 14 It was
about the sixth hour on the
day of Preparation for the
Passover, and he said to the
Jews, “Behold, your king!”
15 But they cried out, “Away
with him, away with him,
crucify him!” Pilate said to
them, “Shall I crucify your
king?” The chief priests an-
swered, “We have no king
but Caesar.” 16 Then Pilate
handed Jesus over to them to
be crucified.
is called Golgotha). 18 There
they crucified him, and with
him two others, one on each
side, with Jesus in the mid-
dle. 19 Pilate also wrote a no-
tice and put it on the cross. It
read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the
King of the Jews.” 20 Many
of the Jews read this notice,
because the place where Je-
sus was crucified was near
the city, and it was written in
Hebrew, †Greek, and Latin.
21 Then the chief priests of
the Jews said to Pilate, “Do
not write, ‘The King of the
Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man
said, “I am the king of the
Jews.” ’ ” 22 Pilate answered,
“What I have written, I have
written.”
23 When the soldiers cruci-
fied Jesus, they took his gar-
ments and divided them into
four parts, a part for each
soldier. They also took his
tunic, which was seamless.
It was woven in one piece
from top to bottom, 24 so
they said to one another,
“Let us not tear it apart,
but cast lots for it to decide
whose it will be.” This hap-
pened to fulfill the ‡Scripture

said to the disciple, “Be-
hold, yoʋr mother.” And
from that hour the disciple
took her into his own home.
The Death of Jesus
28 After this, when Jesus
§saw that everything was
now finished, in order to ful-
fill the Scripture he said, “I
am thirsty.” 29 A jar full of
sour wine was there, so they
*filled a sponge with sour
wine, put it around a hyssop
branch, and brought it up to
his mouth. 30 When Jesus
had received the sour wine,
he said, “It is finished.”
Then he bowed his head and
gave up his spirit.
Jesus, they did not break his
legs since they saw that he
was already dead. 34 Instead,
one of the soldiers pierced
Jesus' side with a spear, and
immediately blood and wa-
ter came out. 35 He who
saw this has testified, and
his testimony is true, and he
knows that he speaks what
is true, so that †you may
believe. 36 For these things
happened so that the Scrip-
ture would be fulfilled: “No
bone of his will be broken.”
37 And, as another Scripture
says, “They will look on him
whom they have pierced.”
The Burial of Jesus
After these things,
Joseph of Arimathea, who
was a disciple of Jesus (but
secretly for fear of the
Jews), asked Pilate if he
could take away Jesus' body.
Pilate gave him permission,
so he came and took the

that Jesus must rise from the

went back to their homes.

11 But Mary stood near

to her, “Woman, why are
yoʋ weeping?”
She said
to them, “They have taken
away my Lord, and I do
not know where they have

this, she turned around and
saw Jesus standing there,
but she did not know it
was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to
her, “Woman, why are yoʋ
weeping? Whom are yoʋ
seeking?” Supposing that
he was the gardener, she
said to him, “Sir, if yoʋ have
carried him away, tell me
where yoʋ have laid him,
and I will take him away.”
16 Jesus said to her, “Mary!”
She turned and said to †him,
“Rabboni!” (which means
“Teacher”). 17 Jesus said to
her, “Do not hold on to

went to Simon Peter and to
the other disciple, the one
whom Jesus loved, and said
to them, “They have taken
the Lord out of the tomb,
and we do not know where
they have laid him.” 3 So
Peter went out, along with
the other disciple, and they
began making their way to
the tomb. 4 The two were
running together, but the
other disciple outran Peter
and reached the tomb first.
5 Stooping down to look in,
he saw the linen cloths ly-
ing there, but he did not
go in. 6 Then Simon Pe-
ter, who had been following
him, *arrived and went into
the tomb. He saw the linen
cloths lying there 7 and the
facecloth that had been on
Jesus' head. But it was not
lying with the linen cloths;
it was folded up separately
in another place. 8 Then

Mary Magdalene went and
told the §disciples that she
had seen the Lord and that
he had said these things to
her.
Jesus Appears to His Dis-
ciples
19 In the evening of that
day, the first day of the
week, when the disciples
were *gathered together
with the doors locked for
fear of the Jews, Jesus came
and stood among them and
said to them, “Peace be
with you.” 20 After saying
this, he showed them his
hands and his side, and the
disciples rejoiced when they
saw the Lord. 21 Again Jesus
said to them, “Peace be
with you. As the Father
has sent me, so I am
22 After
sending you.”
saying this, he breathed
on them and said to them,
“Receive the Holy Spirit.
23 If you remit the sins
of any, their sins are
remitted; if you retain the
sins of any, their sins are
retained.”
said to them, “Unless I see
the nail marks in his hands
and put my finger where the
nails were, and put my hand
into his side, I will certainly
not believe.”
26 Eight days later, Je-
sus' disciples were again in-
side, and Thomas was with
them. Although the doors
were locked, Jesus came
and stood among them and
said, “Peace be with you.”
27 Then he said to Thomas,
“Put yoʋr finger here and
look at my hands. Reach
out yoʋr hand and put it
into my side. Do not doubt
28 In re-
but believe.”
sponse Thomas said to him,
“My Lord and my God!”
29 Then Jesus said to him,
“Because yoʋ have seen
†me, have yoʋ come to
believe? Blessed are those
who have not seen and yet
have come to believe.”

himself in this way. 2 Simon

“We will go with yoʋ.” So
they §immediately went
out and got into the boat,
but that night they caught
nothing.
1 After
4 When daybreak came, Je-
sus stood on the shore, but
the disciples did not know
it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said to
them, “Children, have you
caught any fish to eat?”
They answered him, “No.”
6 He said to them, “Cast the
net on the right side of
the boat, and you will find
some.” So they cast it and
were unable to draw it in
because of the large number
of fish. 7 Then the disciple
whom Jesus loved said to
Peter, “It is the Lord!” When
Simon Peter heard that it
was the Lord, he put on his
outer garment (for he had
taken it off) and plunged into

disciples came in the small
boat, dragging the net full
of fish, for they were not
far from shore, only about a
hundred yards away.
9 When they had gone
ashore, they saw a charcoal
fire there with a fish lying on
it, and bread. 10 Jesus said
to them, “Bring some of
the fish that you have just
now caught.” 11 So Simon
Peter went aboard and drew
the net ashore, full of large
fish, one hundred fifty-three
of them.
Although there
were so many, the net had
not torn. 12 Then Jesus said
to them, “Come eat break-
fast.”
Now none of the
disciples dared to ask him,
“Who are yoʋ?” because
they knew it was the Lord.
13 Then Jesus came, took the
bread, and gave it to them.
He did likewise with the fish.
14 This was now the third
time that Jesus had been re-
vealed to *his disciples after
he had been raised from the
dead.

yoʋ.”
Jesus said to him,
“Feed my lambs.” 16 Jesus
said to him a second time,
“Simon, son of ‡Jonah, do
yoʋ love me?” Peter said
to him, “Yes, Lord, yoʋ know
that I care for yoʋ.”

to him the third time, “Si-

yoʋ care for me?” Peter
was grieved that Jesus said
to him the third time, “Do
yoʋ care for me?” And
he said to him, “Lord, yoʋ
know everything; yoʋ know
that I care for yoʋ.”
Je-
sus said to him, “Feed my

say to yoʋ, when yoʋ were
younger, yoʋ would dress

ever yoʋ wanted to go;
but when yoʋ grow old,

hands, and another will
dress yoʋ and bring yoʋ

indicate the kind of death
by which Peter would glorify
God.) After saying this, he
said to Peter, “Follow me.”
among the brothers that this
disciple would not die. Yet
Jesus did not tell him that
he would not die; he only
said, “If I wish for him to
remain until I come, what
is that to yoʋ?”
24 This is the disciple who
is testifying about these
things and who has written
these things, and we know
that his testimony is true.
25 There are also many
other things that Jesus did.
If every one of them were to
be written down, I suppose
that not even the world itself
would have room for the
books that would be written.
‡Amen.§

20 Then
Peter turned
around and saw the disciple
whom Jesus loved following
them (the one who had
leaned back on Jesus' chest
at the supper and said,
“Lord, who is it that is going
to betray yoʋ?”) 21 When
Peter saw him, he said to
Jesus, “Lord, what about
him?” 22 Jesus said to him,

and speaking about the king-

15 In those days Peter stood
up among the *disciples (a
crowd of about one hundred
twenty people who were
gathered together). He said,
16 “Brothers, it was neces-
sary for †this Scripture to
be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit foretold by the mouth
of David concerning Judas,
who became a guide to those
who arrested Jesus. 17 For he
was numbered ‡with us and
received his share in this
ministry.” 18 (Now this man
Judas had acquired a field
with the wages of unrigh-
teousness, and falling head-
first, his body burst open,
and all his intestines gushed
out. 19 This became known
to all who were dwelling in
Jerusalem, so that in their
language the field was called
Akeldama, that is, Field of
Blood.) 20 Peter continued,
“For it is written in the Book
of Psalms:
‘May his homestead become
desolate;
let there be no one to dwell
in it,’
and,
‘May another take his posi-
tion as overseer.’

prayed, “Lord, yoʋ know

have chosen 25 to *receive

this sound occurred, the
multitude came together,
and they were bewildered
because each one of them
heard his own language

15 These men are not drunk,
as you suppose, for it is
only the third hour of the
day. 16 But this is what was
spoken through the prophet
Joel:
17 ‘In the last days, says God,
I will pour out my Spirit
upon all flesh.
Your sons and your daugh-
ters will prophesy,
your young men will see vi-
sions,
and your old men will

18 Even upon my male and

I will pour out my Spirit in

him from the pangs of death,

among his descendants, ac-
cording to the flesh, he
would raise up the Christ to
sit on his throne, 31 David
foresaw what would happen
and spoke about the resur-
rection of the Christ, saying
that ‡his soul was not aban-
doned to Hades and that his
flesh did not see corruption.
32 This Jesus God has raised

heart and said to Peter

Peter Heals a Lame Man
1 One day Peter and John

to the temple at the hour
of prayer, the ninth hour.
2 And a man who was lame
from his mother's womb was
being carried in. Every day
people would lay him at the
gate of the temple called
the Beautiful Gate so that
he could ask for alms from

the temple courts. 3 When

his attention, expecting to
receive something from
them. 6 But Peter said, “I
have no silver or gold, but
what I do have I give to yoʋ.
In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, †rise up and
walk.” 7 Then Peter took
hold of him by the right
hand and raised him up,
and at once his feet and
ankles were strengthened.
8 Leaping up, he stood and
began walking.
Then he
entered the temple courts

utterly astonished. 12 When
Peter saw this, he addressed
the people: “Men of Israel,
why are you amazed at this,
or why are you staring at
us as though by our own
power or godliness we have
made this man walk? 13 The
God of §Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, the God of our fa-
thers, has glorified his ser-
vant Jesus, whom you de-
livered up and denied in
the presence of Pilate, even
though Pilate had decided
to release him. 14 Yes, you
denied the Holy and Righ-
teous One and asked for a
murderer to be granted to
you. 15 You put to death
the Author of life, whom
God raised from the dead,
of which we are witnesses.

through Jesus has given him
this perfect health in the

17 “Now, brothers, I know
that you acted in ignorance,
as did your rulers also.
18 But in this way God ful-
filled what he had foretold
through the mouths of all
*his prophets, that the Christ
would suffer. 19 Therefore
repent and turn back so
that your sins may be wiped
away, that times of refresh-
ing may come from the pres-
ence of the Lord, 20 and
that he may send †Jesus,
the Christ who has been ap-
pointed for you. 21 Heaven
must receive him until the
time comes for the restora-
tion of all things, which God
declared by the mouth of
‡all his holy prophets long
ago. 22 §For Moses said to
our fathers, ‘The Lord *our
God will raise up for you a
prophet like me from among
your brothers.

listen to everything he tells
you. 23 Every soul who does
not listen to that prophet

Peter and John Brought
Before the Council
1 As Peter and John were
speaking to the people,
the *priests, the captain of
the temple guard, and the
Sadducees came to them,
2 greatly annoyed because
they were teaching the
people and proclaiming
in Jesus the resurrection
from the dead. 3 So they
arrested them and took
them into custody until the
next day, for it was already
evening. 4 But many who
heard the word believed,
and the number of men who
believed came to about five
thousand.
5 On the next day, the
rulers, elders, and scribes
were gathered together in
6 along with
†Jerusalem,
Annas the high priest,
Caiaphas, John, Alexander,
and all who were members
of the high-priestly family.
7 After making Peter and
John stand before them, they
began to question them: “By
what power or by what
name did you do this?”
8 Then Peter, filled with the
Holy Spirit, said to them,
“Rulers of the people and
elders ‡of Israel, 9 if we
are being examined today
about a good deed done to
a disabled man and by what
means he has been healed,
10 let it be known to you
all, and to all the people
of Israel, that this man is
standing before you in good
health by the name of Jesus
Christ of Nazareth, whom
you crucified and whom
God raised from the dead.
11 This Jesus is the stone
that was rejected by you, the
builders, which has become
the cornerstone. 12 There
is salvation in no other, for
there is no other §name
given among men by which
we must be saved.”
13 When they saw the
boldness of Peter and John,
and when they realized that
they were uneducated and
untrained men, they were
amazed and recognized that
they had been with Jesus.
14 But since they could see

they ordered Peter and John
to step out from the San-
hedrin while they conferred
with one another, 16 saying,
“What should we do with
these men? For it is evident
to all who dwell in Jerusalem
that a notable sign has been
done through them, and we
cannot deny it. 17 But so
that it may not spread any
further among the people,
*we will †strictly warn them
to speak no more in this
name to ‡any of the people.”
18 Then they called them in
and ordered them not to
speak or teach at all in the
name of Jesus. 19 But Peter
and John answered them,
“Whether it is right in the
sight of God to listen to you
rather than to God, you must

21 So after threatening Peter
and John further, they re-
leased them, finding no way
to punish them, because all
the people were glorifying
God for what had happened.
22 For the man on whom
this sign of healing had been
performed was more than
forty years old.
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4:30
23 After being released, Pe-
ter and John went to their
own people and reported all
that the chief priests and
the elders had said to them.
24 When they heard this,
they lifted up their voices
with one accord to God and
said, “Master, yoʋ §are God,

31 After they prayed, the
place where they were gath-
ered together was shaken,
and they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit and began
speaking the word of God
with boldness.
The Believers Share Their
Belongings
32 Now the hearts and
souls of the multitude of be-
lievers were one, and no one
was saying that any of ‡their
belongings was his own, but
everything they owned was
held in common. 33 With
great power the apostles
were giving testimony to the
resurrection of the Lord Je-
sus, and great grace was
upon them all. 34 There was
no one needy among them,
for all who owned plots of
land or houses sold them
and brought the proceeds
of what was sold. 35 They
laid the money at the feet
of the apostles, and the
proceeds were distributed
to anyone who had need.
36 §Joses, whom the apos-
tles called Barnabas (which
means “Son of Encourage-
ment”), a Levite and Cypriot
by birth, 37 also sold a field
he owned and then brought
the money and laid it at the
apostles' feet.

1 Now a man named Ana-

Sapphira, sold a piece of
property 2 and kept back
some of the proceeds, with
his wife also being aware
of it. He brought a portion
of the proceeds and laid it
at the apostles' feet. 3 But
Peter said, “Ananias, why
has Satan filled yoʋr heart
to lie to the Holy Spirit and
keep back some of the pro-
ceeds of the plot of land?
4 While it remained unsold,
did it not remain yoʋrs? And
once it was sold, was it not
under yoʋr control? How
is it that yoʋ have put this
thing in yoʋr heart? Yoʋ

heard these words, he fell
down and breathed his last
breath. And great fear came
upon all who heard about
it. 6 Then the young men
rose, wrapped up his body,
carried him out, and buried
him.
7 About three hours later,
his wife came in, not know-
ing what had happened.
8 Peter said to her, “Tell me if
you sold the plot of land for
such and such a price.” She
said, “Yes, for such a price.”
9 Peter said to her, “Why is
it that you have agreed to
put the Spirit of the Lord to
the test? Behold, the feet
of those who buried yoʋr

and they will carry yoʋ out.”

men came in, they found
her dead, so they carried her

her husband. 11 And great
fear came upon the whole
church and upon all who
heard these things.
The Apostles Perform
Signs and Wonders

wonders were taking place
among the people by the
hands of the apostles, and

one else dared to join them,
but the people held them in
high regard. 14 Yet more
and more people believed in
the Lord and were added to
their number, a multitude of
both men and women. 15 As
a result, people *carried the
sick out into the streets and
laid them on beds and mats,
so that when Peter came by
at least his shadow might
fall on one of them. 16 A
multitude from the towns
all around Jerusalem also
gathered together, bringing
the sick and those harassed
by unclean spirits, and they
were all healed.
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5:25
they were filled with jeal-
ousy. 18 So they arrested
the apostles and put them
in a public jail. 19 But dur-
ing the night an angel of
the Lord opened the doors
of the prison, brought them
out, and said, 20 “Go stand
in the temple courts and tell
the people everything about
this new life.” 21 When they
heard this, they entered the
temple courts at dawn and
began teaching.
When the high priest
came, along with those who
were with him, they called
together the Sanhedrin—
that is, the entire eldership
of the sons of Israel—and
sent officers to the prison
to have the apostles brought
before them. 22 But when
the officers arrived, they
did not find them in the
prison.
So they returned
and reported, 23 “We found
the prison locked up in
complete security and the
guards †standing ‡in front
of the doors, but when we
opened the doors, we found
no one inside.” 24 When
the §high priest, the captain
of the temple guard, and
the chief priests heard this
report, they were greatly
perplexed by it, wondering
what might come of this.
25 Then someone came and
told them, “Behold, the
men you put in prison

26 So the captain went with
the officers and brought the
apostles without the use of
force, for they were afraid
the people might stone them.
27 After bringing the apos-

before the Sanhedrin, and
the high priest *asked them,
28 “Did we not strictly com-
mand you not to teach in this

35 “This is the same Moses
they had rejected, saying,
‘Who appointed yoʋ to be a
ruler and judge?’ He is the
one God sent as §a ruler and
redeemer by the hand of the
angel who appeared to him
in the bush. 36 He is the one
who led them out, perform-
ing wonders and signs in
*the land of Egypt, at the Red
Sea, and in the wilderness
for forty years. 37 This is the
same Moses who said to the
sons of Israel, ‘†The Lord our
God will raise up for you a
prophet like me from among
your ‡brothers.’ 38 This is the
man who was in the assem-
bly in the wilderness with
the angel who spoke to him
on Mount Sinai, and with
our fathers. He received §a
living word to give to *us.
39 Our fathers were unwill-
ing to obey him. Instead,
they thrust him aside, and
in their hearts they turned
back to Egypt, 40 saying to
Aaron, ‘Make us gods who
will go before us, for we
do not know what has hap-
pened to this Moses who led
us out of the land of Egypt.’
41 In those days they made
an idol in the form of a
calf, brought a sacrifice to

the idol, and rejoiced at the
works of their hands. 42 But
God turned away from them
and gave them up to serve
the host of heaven, just as it
is written in the book of the
prophets:
‘Was it to me that you of-
fered slain beasts and
sacrifices
for forty years in the wilder-
ness, O house of Is-
rael?
43 You took up the tabernacle
of Molech
and the star of †your god
‡Remphan,
the images you made so
that you could wor-

so I will send you into exile
beyond Babylon.’
44 “§Our fathers had the
tabernacle of the testimony
in the wilderness, just as
God had directed when he
spoke to Moses and told
him to make it according
to the pattern he had seen.

they cried out with a loud
voice, stopped their ears,
and rushed at him with one
accord. 58 Then they drove
him out of the city and began
stoning him. Meanwhile, the
witnesses laid their cloaks
at the feet of a young man
named Saul. 59 They contin-
ued stoning Stephen while
he prayed, “Lord Jesus, re-
ceive my spirit!” 60 Then he
fell to his knees and cried
out with a loud voice, “Lord,

fell asleep.

the
Church
On that day a great
persecution arose against
the church in Jerusalem,
and all the believers except
the apostles were scattered
throughout the regions of
Judea and Samaria. 2 Devout
men carried Stephen away
for burial and made great
lamentation over him. 3 But
Saul was ravaging the
church. Entering house after

men and women and put
them in prison.

Philip Preaches the Good
News in Samaria
4 Now those who had
been scattered went around
preaching the message of
good news. 5 Philip went
down to *a city of Samaria
and began proclaiming to
them the Christ. 6 With one
accord the crowds paid close
attention to what Philip said
as they listened to him and
saw the signs he was per-
forming. 7 For unclean spir-
its came out of many who
had them, crying out with
a loud voice, and many
who were paralyzed or lame
were healed. 8 And there
was great joy in that city.

After
he was baptized, he kept
close company with Philip
and was amazed as he saw
§miracles and signs taking
place.
14 When
the apostles
in Jerusalem heard that
Samaria had received the
word of God, they sent them
Peter and John. 15 These
two went down and prayed
for the Samaritan believers
to receive the Holy Spirit,
16 for the Spirit had not yet
fallen upon any of them;
they had only been baptized
in the name of *Christ
17 Then Peter and
Jesus.
John laid their hands on
the Samaritan believers, and
they received the Holy Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that
the †Holy Spirit was given
through the laying on of the
apostles' hands, he offered
them money, 19 saying, “Give
this power to me as well,
so that whomever I lay my
hands on may receive the
Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter
said to him, “May yoʋr
silver be destroyed with
yoʋ, because yoʋ thought
yoʋ could acquire the gift
of God with money! 21 Yoʋ

Simon the Magician
Now a man named
Simon had previously prac-

and amazed the people of
Samaria, declaring himself
to be someone great. 10 From
the least to the greatest,
†they paid close attention
to him, saying, “This man
is the ‡great power of
God.” 11 They all paid close
attention to him because he
had amazed them with his
magical arts for a long time.
12 But when they believed
Philip as he preached good
news about the kingdom
of God and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were
baptized, both men and

three days without seeing,
and neither ate nor drank.
10 Now there was a dis-
ciple in Damascus named
Ananias. The Lord said to
him in a vision, “Ananias.”
He said, “Behold, here I am,
Lord.” 11 Then the Lord said
to him, “Get up and go to

he is praying, 12 and §in a

14 And here he has authority
from the chief priests to ar-

The Conversion of Saul
Meanwhile Saul, still
breathing out threats and
murder against the disciples
of the Lord, went to the
high priest 2 and asked for
letters from him to the syna-
gogues in Damascus, so that
if he found any who be-
longed to the Way, whether
men or women, he might
bring them to Jerusalem as
prisoners. 3 As he was go-
ing along, he drew near to
Damascus, and suddenly a

how much he must suffer
for my name's sake.” 17 So
Ananias went and entered
the house. Laying his hands
on Saul, he said, “Brother
Saul, the †Lord, who ap-
peared to yoʋ on the road by
which yoʋ came, has sent me
so that yoʋ may receive yoʋr
sight and be filled with the
Holy Spirit.” 18 Immediately
something like scales fell
from Saul's eyes, and he
‡received his sight.
Then
he rose and was baptized,
19 and after taking some
food, he was strengthened.
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9:31
23 When
many days had
past, the Jews took counsel
together to kill him, 24 but
their plot became known to
Saul. They started watching
the gates both day and night
so that they might kill him.
25 But *the disciples took him
by night and let him down
through a window in the
city wall, lowering him in a
basket.
Saul Escapes DeathSaul in Jerusalem
Saul arrived in
Jerusalem, he tried to join
the disciples, but they were
all afraid of him because
they did not believe that he
was a disciple. 27 Barnabas,
however, took him and
brought him to the apostles.
He related to them how Saul
had seen the Lord on the
road and that the Lord had
spoken to him, and how he
had been preaching boldly
in Damascus in the name
of †Jesus. 28 So Saul stayed
with them and would go
‡into Jerusalem and speak
boldly in the name of §the
Lord Jesus. 29 He would also
speak and debate with the
Hellenists, but they were
trying to kill him. 30 When
the brothers found out about
it, they brought him down to
Caesarea and sent him off to
Tarsus.

said, “Is this not the man

Saul grew stronger and kept

that this man Jesus is the

the fear of the Lord and in
the encouragement of the
Holy Spirit, they were being

Peter Heals Aeneas
32 Now as Peter was trav-
eling from place to place, he
went down to the saints who
dwelt in Lydda. 33 There he
found a man named Aeneas,
who was paralyzed and had
been confined to a mat for
eight years. 34 Peter said to
him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ
has now healed yoʋ; rise and
roll up yoʋr mat.” Immedi-
ately he rose, 35 and all who
dwelt in Lydda and Sharon
saw him and turned to the
Lord.
Peter Raises Dorcas
36 Now in Joppa there was
a disciple named Tabitha
(which means “Dorcas”).
She was always doing
good works and charitable
acts. 37 In those days she
became sick and died, so
they washed her body and
laid it in †an upper room.
38 Lydda was near Joppa,
so when the disciples heard
that Peter was there, they
sent ‡for him, urging §him
not to delay in coming to
them. 39 So Peter rose and
went with them. When he
arrived, they brought him to
the upper room, and all the
widows stood before him,
weeping and showing him
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10:5
all the tunics and cloaks that
Dorcas had made while she
was still with them. 40 But
Peter sent them all outside,
knelt down, and prayed.
Turning toward the body,
he said, “Tabitha, arise.”
Then she opened her eyes,
and seeing Peter, she sat
up. 41 He gave her his hand
and raised her up. Then
he called in the saints and
the widows and presented
her alive. 42 This became
known throughout all Joppa,
and many believed in the
Lord. 43 And Peter remained
in Joppa for many days with
a tanner named Simon.

went away, Cornelius called
two of his servants and a

he sent them to Joppa.

men were traveling along
and approaching the city, Pe-

Peter Reports to the
Church in Jerusalem
1 Now the apostles and
the brothers who were in
Judea heard that the Gentiles
had also received the word
of God. 2 So when Peter
came up to Jerusalem, those
of the circumcision faction
began disputing with him,
3 *saying, “Yoʋ went into the
house of uncircumcised men
and ate with them!” 4 But
Peter began to explain the
situation to them, step by
step, saying, 5 “I was praying
in the city of Joppa, and in
a trance I saw a vision of
an object like a large sheet
coming down, being low-
ered from heaven by its four
corners, and it came to me.
6 As I stared at it, I looked
closely and saw four-footed
animals of the earth, as well
as wild beasts, reptiles, and
birds of the sky. 7 †Then
I heard a voice saying to
me, ‘Rise, Peter, kill and
eat.’ 8 But I said, ‘Surely not,
Lord! For nothing defiled or
unclean has ever entered my
mouth.’ 9 The voice from
heaven responded ‡to me a
second time: ‘Do not re-
gard as defiled what God
has made clean.’ 10 This
happened three times, and
then everything was drawn
up again into heaven. 11 And
behold, at that very moment
three men arrived at the

ers from among the circum-

Peter were astonished, be-
cause the gift of the Holy
Spirit was being poured out
even on the Gentiles. 46 For
they heard them speaking
in tongues and magnifying
God. Then Peter responded,
47 “Can anyone withhold wa-
ter for baptizing these peo-
ple who have received the
Holy Spirit just as we have?”
48 So he gave orders to have
them baptized in the name
of †the Lord.
Then they

I began to speak, the Holy
Spirit fell upon them, just
as he had fallen upon us
at the beginning. 16 Then I
remembered what the Lord
had said: ‘John baptized
with water, but you will
be baptized with the Holy
Spirit.’ 17 If then God gave
them the same gift that he
gave us when we believed
in the Lord Jesus ‡Christ,
how could I stand in God's
way?” 18 When the apos-
tles and brothers heard this,
they ceased their objections
and began glorifying God,
saying, “Then to the Gentiles
also God has granted the re-
pentance that leads to life.”

this reached the ears of the
church in Jerusalem, and
they sent Barnabas out †to
go to Antioch. 23 When he
arrived and saw the grace of
God, he rejoiced and began
exhorting all the believers to
remain true to the Lord with
resolute hearts. 24 For he
was a good man, full of the
Holy Spirit and faith, and a
large number of people were
added to the Lord. 25 Then
Barnabas went to Tarsus to
look for Saul. 26 When he
found him, he brought him
to Antioch. So for an en-
tire year they met with the
church and taught a large
number of people, and it
was in Antioch that the dis-
ciples were first called Chris-
tians.
In those days some

a severe famine was about
to come upon the entire
world (which ‡indeed took
place in the time of Claudius
§Caesar). 29 So the disciples,
each according to his own
ability, determined to send
relief to the brothers who
dwelt in Judea. 30 This they
did, sending it to the elders
by the hands of Barnabas
and Saul.
12
James Killed and Peter Im-
prisoned
1 About that time King
Herod arrested some who
belonged to the church in
order to harm them. 2 He
killed James the brother
of John with the sword.
3 And when he saw that this
pleased the Jews, he pro-
ceeded to arrest Peter also.
(This took place during the
Feast of Unleavened Bread.)
4 After seizing him, he put
him in prison, handing him
over to be guarded by four
squads of four soldiers each.
Herod planned to bring him
out to the people after the
Passover. 5 So Peter was kept
in prison, but the church
was earnestly praying to God
for him.
An Angel Frees Peter from
Prison
6 The very night before
Herod was going to bring
him out, Peter was sleeping
between two soldiers, bound
with two chains, while the
guards in front of the door
§ 11:28 Caesar ¦ — CT
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12:14
were keeping watch over the
prison. 7 And behold, an an-
gel of the Lord stood before
Peter, and a light shone in
the cell. The angel struck Pe-
ter on the side and woke him
up, saying, “Get up quickly!”
And the chains fell off Peter's

said to him, “Get dressed
and put on yoʋr sandals.”
And Peter did so. Then the
angel said to him, “Put on
yoʋr cloak and follow me.”
9 So Peter went out and fol-
lowed him, but he did not
realize that what the angel
was doing was really hap-
pening; he thought he was
seeing a vision. 10 After they
passed the first and second
guard, they came to the iron
gate leading into the city. It
opened for them on its own,
and they went out. When
they had gone the length of
one street, the angel imme-
diately left him. 11 When
Peter came to his senses,
he said, “Now I truly know
that the Lord has sent his
angel and rescued me from
the hand of Herod and from
everything the Jewish peo-
ple were expecting to hap-
pen.” 12 When Peter real-
ized this, he went to the
house of Mary, the mother of
John (who was called Mark),
where many had gathered
together and were praying.
13 Peter knocked at the door
of the gate, and a servant
girl named Rhoda came to
answer. 14 When she recog-
nized Peter's voice, she wasTHE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12:15
so overjoyed that she did
not open the gate, but ran
in and reported that Peter
was standing in front of the
gate. 15 They said to her,
“Yoʋ are out of yoʋr mind.”
But when she kept insisting
that it was so, they said, “It is
his angel.” 16 Meanwhile Pe-
ter continued knocking, and
when they opened the gate,
they saw him and were as-
tonished. 17 But motioning
to them with his hand to be
silent, he told them how the
Lord had brought him out of
prison. He also said, “Tell
these things to James and to
the brothers.” Then he left
and went to another place.
18 When daybreak came,
there was a great commo-
tion among the soldiers as to
what had become of Peter.
19 When Herod searched for
him but did not find him, he
questioned the guards and
ordered them to be led away
and executed. Then he went
down from Judea to Cae-
sarea and spent time there.
The Death of Herod
20 Now Herod was having
an angry dispute with the
people of Tyre and Sidon.
So they came to him with
one accord, and having won
over Blastus, the king's per-
sonal attendant, they asked
for peace, because their
country was supplied with
food from the king's coun-

an angel of the Lord struck
Herod down because he did
not give *glory to God, and
he was eaten by worms and
breathed his last breath.
24 But the word of †God
increased and multiplied.
25 And
when Barnabas
and Saul completed their
ministry, they returned ‡to
Jerusalem and brought with
them John, who was called
Mark.
13
Barnabas and Saul Are
Commissioned
1 Now at the church in
Antioch there were *certain
prophets
and
teachers:
Barnabas,
Simeon (who
was called Niger), Lucius
of Cyrene, Manaen (who
had been brought up with
Herod the tetrarch), and
Saul. 2 As they were serving
the Lord and fasting, the
Holy Spirit said, “Set apart
for me Barnabas and Saul
for the work to which I have
called them.” 3 So after they
had fasted and prayed, they
laid their hands on them and
sent them off.

Being sent out by the
Holy Spirit, the two of them
went down to Seleucia, and
from there they sailed to
Cyprus. 5 When they arrived
at Salamis, they proclaimed
the word of God in the syn-
agogues of the Jews. (They
also had John as their as-
sistant.) 6 When they had
gone across the †island to
Paphos, they came across a
certain magician, a Jewish
false prophet named Bar-
Jesus. 7 He was with the
proconsul Sergius Paulus, an
intelligent man, who sum-
moned Barnabas and Saul,
seeking to hear the word of

God.
Elymas (for that is what his
name means) opposed them,
seeking to turn the procon-
sul away from the faith.
9 But Saul, also known as
Paul, filled with the Holy
Spirit, looked intently at Ely-
mas 10 and said, “O son of the
devil, full of all deceit and all
trickery, enemy of all righ-
teousness, will yoʋ not cease
perverting the straight paths
of the Lord? 11 And now, be-
hold, the hand of the Lord is
against yoʋ, and yoʋ will be

diately a mist and darkness
fell upon him, and he was
going around seeking people
to lead him by the hand.
12 When the proconsul saw

what had happened, he be-

at the teaching of the Lord.
Paul and Barnabas in An-
tioch of Pisidia
13 Then Paul and his com-
panions set sail from Paphos
and went to Perga in Pam-
phylia, but John left them
and returned to Jerusalem.
14 Continuing on from Perga,
they came to Antioch in Pi-
sidia. On the Sabbath day
they went into the syna-
gogue and sat down. 15 After
the reading of the Law and
the Prophets, the rulers of
the synagogue sent them a
message, saying, “Brothers,
if you have any word of
exhortation for the people,
speak it.”
16 Standing up, Paul mo-
tioned with his hand and
said, “Men of Israel, and you
who fear God, listen. 17 The
God of this ‡people chose
our fathers and exalted the
people during their sojourn
in the land of Egypt, and
with an uplifted arm he led
them out of that country.
18 For about forty years, he
put up with them in the
wilderness, 19 and after de-
stroying seven nations in the
land of Canaan, he gave
his people their land as an
§inheritance. 20 After that he
gave them judges for about

up to the time of *Samuel
the prophet. 21 Then the
people asked for a king,
and God gave them Saul
the son of Kish, a man
of the tribe of Benjamin,
who reigned for forty years.
22 After removing Saul, God
raised up David as their
king, about whom he tes-
tified, ‘I have found David
the son of Jesse to be a
man after my own heart; he
will do all that I want him
to do.’ 23 From this man's
offspring God †brought sal-
vation to Israel, according
to his promise, 24 after John
had first preached a baptism
of repentance to ‡Israel in
advance of the coming Sav-
ior. 25 Now as John was com-
pleting his course, he said,
‘§Who do you suppose that I
am? I am not he. But behold,
one is coming after me, the
sandals of whose feet I am
not worthy to untie.’
26 “Brothers, sons of the
family of Abraham, and
those among you who fear
God, to *you the message of
this salvation has been sent.
27 Since those who dwell in
Jerusalem, along with their
rulers, failed to recognize
this man and the voices of
the prophets that are read
every Sabbath, they fulfilled

raised him from the dead,
31 and for many days he
was seen by those who had
come up with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem, who
†are his witnesses to the peo-
ple. 32 And we preach to
you the good news that what
God promised to our fathers,
he has fulfilled to ‡us, their
children, by raising up Jesus,
33 just as it is written in the
second Psalm,
‘Yoʋ are my son;
today I have begotten yoʋ.’
34 As
for the fact that he
raised him from the dead, no
longer to return to corrup-
tion, God has spoken in this
way:
‘I will give you the holy
and sure blessings of
David.’
35 Therefore
it also says in
another place:
‘Yoʋ will not let yoʋr Holy
One see corruption.’

asleep, was added to his
fathers, and saw corruption.
37 But he whom God raised
up did not see corruption.
38 Therefore let it be known
to you,
brothers,
that
through this man remission
of sins is proclaimed to you,
39 and by this man everyone
who believes is set free from
everything from which you
could not be set free by the
law of Moses. 40 So beware
that what is said in the
prophets does not happen
§to you:
41 ‘Behold, you scoffers,
be amazed and perish,
for I am doing a work in
your *days
that you will certainly not
believe,
even if someone tells you
about it.’ ”
42 Now as Paul and Barn-
abas were going out †from
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13:51
44 On
the following Sab-
bath, nearly the entire city
was gathered together to
hear the word of §God.
45 But when the Jews saw
the crowds, they were filled
with jealousy and began to
contradict what Paul was
saying, *opposing him and
slandering him. 46 But Paul
and Barnabas spoke boldly,
saying, “It was necessary for
the word of God to be spoken
first to you. But since you
are rejecting it and do not
judge yourselves to be wor-
thy of eternal life, behold,
we are turning to the Gen-
tiles. 47 For this is what the
Lord has commanded us:
‘I have appointed yoʋ to be
a light to the Gentiles,
so that yoʋ may bring salva-
tion to the ends of the
earth.’ ”
48 When
the Gentiles
heard this, they began
rejoicing and †glorifying
the word of ‡the Lord, and
all who were appointed
to eternal life believed.
49 So the word of the Lord
spread
throughout
that
entire region. 50 But the Jews
incited the devout women
of high standing and the
prominent men of the city.

them to speak about these
things on the next Sabbath.
43 And when the meeting
of the synagogue was dis-
persed, many of the Jews
and the devout converts to
Judaism followed Paul and
Barnabas, who spoke to
them and persuaded them to
continue in the grace of God.

Barnabas shook off the dust
from their feet in protest
against them and went to

were filled with joy and with
the Holy Spirit.
14
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14:16
Paul and Barnabas in
Lystra
8 Now there was a man
sitting in Lystra who could
not use his feet.
He
had been lame from his
mother's womb and had
never walked. 9 This man
listened to Paul as he was
speaking.
Paul looked at
him intently, and when he
saw that he had faith to be
healed, 10 he said with a loud
voice, “Stand up on yoʋr
feet!” So the man leaped up
and began to walk. 11 When
the crowds saw what Paul
had done, they lifted up their
voices, saying in Lycaonian,
“The gods have come down
to us in the likeness of men.”
12 Barnabas they called Zeus,
and Paul they called Hermes,
since he was the one who
took the lead in speaking.
13 Then the priest of the
shrine of Zeus that was
located in front of †their city
brought bulls and garlands
to the city gates, intending to
offer sacrifices together with
the crowds. 14 But when the
apostles Barnabas and Paul
heard about it, they tore
their clothes and ‡rushed
into the crowd, crying out,
15 “Men, why are you doing
these things? We also are
men with the same nature
as you. We are bringing you
good news, telling you to
turn from these worthless
things to §the living God,
who made the heavens,
the earth, the sea, and all
that is in them. 16 In past

1 At Iconium Paul and
Barnabas went together into
the synagogue of the Jews
and spoke in such a way
that a great multitude of
both Jews and Greeks be-
lieved. 2 But the Jews who
refused to believe stirred up
and corrupted the minds of
the Gentiles to be against
the brothers. 3 So Paul and
Barnabas spent a long time
there, speaking boldly for
the Lord, who was testify-
ing to the message of his
grace *by granting signs and
wonders to be done by their
hands. 4 But the popula-
tion of the city was divided;
some were with the Jews,
and some were with the
apostles. 5 And when an
attempt was made by both
the Gentiles and the Jews,
together with their rulers,
to mistreat them and stone
them, 6 Paul and Barnabas
became aware of it and fled
for refuge to the Lycaonian
cities of Lystra and Derbe
and to the surrounding re-
gion. 7 There they continued
to preach the gospel.

the nations to go their own
way, 17 although he did
not leave himself without a
witness in that he did good
by giving *you rain from
heaven and fruitful seasons,
filling †our hearts with food
and gladness.” 18 Yet even
by saying these things, they
barely restrained the crowds
from offering sacrifices to
them.
19 Then some Jews came
from Antioch and Iconium
and persuaded the crowds.
They stoned Paul and
dragged him out of the city,
supposing that he was dead.
20 But when the disciples
gathered around him, he
rose and entered the city.
The next day he went on
with Barnabas to Derbe.

THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15:3
to the Lord in whom they
had come to believe.
24 After passing through
Pisidia, they came to Pam-
phylia, 25 and when they had
spoken the word in Perga,
they went down to Attalia.
26 From there they sailed
to Antioch, where they had
been committed to the grace
of God for the work they
had now completed. 27 After
they arrived and gathered
the church together, they re-
ported all that God had done
through them, and how he
had opened a door of faith
to the Gentiles. 28 And they
stayed ‡there with the disci-
ples for some time.

The Jerusalem Council
Then some men came
down from Judea and were
teaching the brothers: “If
you are not circumcised
according to the custom
of Moses, you cannot be
saved.” 2 *Therefore, when
Paul and Barnabas had
a great dissension and
debate with them,
the
brothers appointed Paul and
Barnabas and some others
from among the believers
to go up to the apostles
and elders in Jerusalem to
discuss this issue. 3 After
being sent on their way
by the church, they passed
through †Phoenicia and
Samaria and brought great

them that through many

when they described in
detail the conversion of

arrived in Jerusalem, they
were welcomed by the
church, the apostles, and the
elders, and they reported all
that God had done through

believers who belonged to
the sect of the Pharisees
stood up, saying, “It is
necessary to circumcise the
Gentiles and command them
to keep the law of Moses.”
6 So the apostles and the
elders gathered together to
consider this matter. 7 After
there had been much de-
bate, Peter stood up and
said to them, “Brothers, you
know that in the early days
God made a choice among
§us, that by the words of my
mouth the Gentiles would
hear the message of the
gospel and believe. 8 And
God, who knows the heart,
testified to them by giving
them the Holy Spirit, just as
he did to us. 9 He made no
distinction between us and
them, purifying their hearts
by faith. 10 Now then, why
are you putting God to the
test by placing a yoke on the
neck of the disciples that nei-
ther our fathers nor we have
been able to bear? 11 On the
contrary, we believe that we
are saved by the grace of the
Lord *Jesus in the same way
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15:21
they are.”
12 Then the entire as-
sembly fell silent as they
listened to Barnabas and
Paul tell of all the signs and
wonders God had performed
through them among the
Gentiles. 13 When they had
finished speaking, James
replied, “Brothers, listen to
me. 14 Simeon has related
how God first visited the
Gentiles, to take from among
them a people for his name.
15 The words of the prophets
are in agreement with this,
just as it is written:
16 ‘After this I will return
and rebuild the taberna-
cle of David that has
fallen;
I will rebuild its ruins
and erect it again,
17 so that the rest of mankind
may seek the Lord,
even all the Gentiles who are
called by my name,
says the Lord, who †does ‡all
these things.’
18 All God's works are known
to
him from long ago.
Therefore my judgment
is that we not create
difficulties for those among
the Gentiles who turn to
God, 20 but that we write to
them, telling them to abstain
from things defiled by idols,
from fornication, from what
has been strangled, and

Paul and Barnabas Part
Company
36 After some days had
gone by, Paul said to Barn-
abas, “Let us return and
visit *our brothers in every
city where we proclaimed
the word of the Lord, to
see how they are doing.”
37 Now Barnabas wanted to
bring John, †who was called
Mark. 38 But Paul thought
it best not to bring this
man who had deserted them
in Pamphylia and had not
gone on with them in their

a sharp disagreement, with
the result that they parted
from one another.
Barn-

off to Cyprus, 40 but Paul
chose Silas and departed,

by the brothers to the grace
of ‡God. 41 And he went
through Syria and Cilicia,
strengthening the churches.

with him, so he took him and
circumcised him because of
the Jews who were in those
places, for they all knew that
his father was a Greek. 4 As
they went through the cities,
they delivered the decisions
that had been reached by
the apostles and the elders
in Jerusalem for the Gentile
believers to obey. 5 So the
churches were strengthened
in the faith and increased in
number every day.
Paul's Vision of the Mace-
donian Man
6 Then Paul and his com-
panions went through Phry-
gia and the region of Galatia,
having been forbidden by
the Holy Spirit from speak-
ing the word in Asia. 7 When
they reached Mysia, they
tried to go †on toward Bithy-
nia, but the ‡Spirit did not
allow them. 8 So passing by
Mysia, they went down to
Troas. 9 During the night
Paul had a vision. A Mace-
donian man was standing
there, urging him, “Come
over to Macedonia and help
us!” 10 After Paul saw the
vision, we immediately en-
deavored to go on to Mace-
donia, concluding that §the
Lord had called us to preach
the gospel to them.

on the next day we went
to Neapolis. 12 From there
we went on to Philippi,

and a *leading city of that

day we went outside the
†city to a riverside, where
‡it was customary for there
to be prayer. We sat down
and began speaking to the
women who had gathered
together. 14 One of those
listening to us was a woman
named Lydia. She was a
worshiper of God from the
city of Thyatira and a seller
of purple cloth. The Lord
opened her heart to respond
to what Paul was saying.
15 After she was baptized,
along with her household,
she urged us, “If you have
judged me to be faithful to
the Lord, come stay at my
house.” And she persuaded
us to do so.

the Most High God, who pro-
claim to *us a way of salva-
tion.” 18 She kept on doing
this for many days, and Paul
became so annoyed that he
turned and said to the spirit,
“I command yoʋ in the name
of Jesus Christ to come out of
her.” And it came out that
very hour.
19 When her masters saw
that their hope for profit
was gone, they seized Paul
and Silas, dragged them to
the marketplace, and set
them before the authorities.
20 After bringing them to
the magistrates, they said,
“These men are seriously
disturbing our city. They are
Jews, 21 and they are pro-
claiming customs that are
not lawful for us as Ro-
mans to accept or practice.”
22 The crowd rose up to-
gether against them, and
the magistrates tore their
garments off them and or-
dered them to be beaten

flicting many blows upon
them, they threw them into
prison, ordering the jailer
to keep them under close
guard. 24 When he received
this order, he put them in
the inner prison and fas-
tened their feet in the stocks.
25 About midnight Paul
and Silas were praying and
singing hymns to God, and
the prisoners were listening
to them. 26 Suddenly there

was awakened, and when he
saw that the doors of the
prison were open, he drew
his sword and was about to
kill himself, assuming that
the prisoners had escaped.
28 But Paul cried out with a
loud voice, “Do yoʋrself no
harm, for we are all here.”
29 Calling for lights, the jailer
rushed in and fell down
trembling before Paul and
Silas. 30 Then he brought
them out and said, “Sirs,
what must I do to be saved?”
31 They said, “Believe in the
Lord Jesus †Christ, and yoʋ
will be saved, yoʋ and yoʋr
household.” 32 Then they
spoke the word of ‡the Lord
to him §and to everyone in
his household. 33 He then
took them in that hour of
the night and washed their
wounds. Then he was bap-
tized at once, along with his
entire household. 34 After
bringing Paul and Silas into
*his house, he set a meal
before them. And he re-
joiced, along with his entire
household, because he had
come to believe in God.

to them, “They beat us in

though we are Roman citi-
zens, and they threw us into
prison. And now they are
sending us away secretly?
Certainly not! Rather, let
them come and escort us
38 So

the officers reported these
words to the magistrates,
and the magistrates were
afraid when they heard that
the men were Roman citi-
zens. 39 So they came and
spoke to them in a concil-
iatory manner. As they es-
corted them out, they begged
them to leave the city. 40 So
Paul and Silas came out of
the prison and went to Ly-
dia's house. And after seeing
the brothers and encourag-
ing them, they departed.

that it was necessary for
the Christ to suffer and to

“This Jesus whom I am
proclaiming to you is the

Jews were persuaded and
joined Paul and Silas, as
did a large number of the
devout Greeks and quite
a few prominent women.
5 But the Jews *who refused
to believe rounded up
some evil men from the
marketplace and formed
a mob, setting the city in
an uproar. They attacked
Jason's house, seeking to
bring Paul and Silas out to
the public assembly. 6 But
when they could not find
them, they dragged Jason
and some other brothers to
the city officials, shouting,

stirred up the crowd and

these things. 9 But when the
city officials had received
a security bond from Jason
and the others, they released
them.

rived, they went to the syn-
agogue of the Jews. 11 Now
these Jews were more noble
than those in Thessalonica,
and they received the word
with great eagerness, exam-
ining the Scriptures every
day to see if what Paul said
was true. 12 As a result,
many of them believed, as
did quite a few of the Greek
women of high standing and
the men. 13 But when the
Jews of Thessalonica found
out that Paul was proclaim-
ing the word of God in Berea
also, they went there as
well, †agitating the crowds.
14 Then the brothers imme-
diately sent Paul ‡away, as
though he were going by
sea, but Silas and Timothy
remained in Berea. 15 Those
who escorted Paul brought
him as far as Athens, and
after they had received an
order for Silas and Timothy
to come to him as soon as
possible, they departed.
Paul in Athens
Paul was wait-
ing for them in Athens, his
spirit was provoked within

with those who happened to
be there. 18 Some of the

Epicurean and Stoic philoso-

him. Some said, “What is
this babbler trying to say?”
But others said, “He seems
to be a proclaimer of for-
eign deities.” (They said this
because he was *preaching
the good news about Jesus
and the resurrection.) 19 So
they took him and brought
him to the Areopagus, say-
ing, “May we know what
this new teaching is that yoʋ
are presenting? 20 For yoʋ
are bringing some strange
things to our ears, and we
would like to know what

32 Now when they heard
about the resurrection of the
dead, some began to scoff,
but others said, “We wish
to hear about this from yoʋ
again.” 33 So Paul departed
from them, 34 but some of
the people joined him and
believed, among whom were

woman named Damaris, and
others with them.

shook out his garments and
said to them, “Your blood be
upon your own heads! I am
innocent. From now on I
will go to the Gentiles.” 7 So
he moved on from there and
went to the house of a man
named ‡Justus, a worshiper
of God, whose house was
next door to the synagogue.
8 Crispus, the ruler of the
synagogue, believed in the
Lord together with his whole
household. And many of
the Corinthians, when they
heard, believed and were
baptized. 9 One night the
Lord said to Paul in a vision:
“Do not be afraid, but
speak and do not be silent.
10 For I am with yoʋ, and
no one will attack yoʋ to
do yoʋ harm, for I have
many people in this city.”
11 So Paul stayed for a year
and six months, teaching the
word of God among them.
Paul in Corinth

from Athens and went to
Corinth. 2 There he found a

down to Antioch. 23 After

he departed and went from

the disciples.

that all who dwelt in Asia,

While Apollos was in
Corinth, Paul went through
the interior regions and
*came to Ephesus, where he
came across some disciples.

and prevailed against them,
so that they fled from the
house naked and wounded.
17 When this became known
to all the Jews and Greeks
who dwelt in Ephesus,
fear fell upon them all,
and the name of the Lord
Jesus was being magnified.
18 Many who had become
believers came forward,
confessing and disclosing
their practices, 19 while
many who practiced magical
arts brought their books
together and began burning
them in front of everyone.
When the value of the books
was added up, the total came

he was a Jew, a single
outcry arose from them all
as they shouted for about
two hours, “Great is Artemis

the city clerk had quieted

after the Feast of Unleav-

later we came to them at
Troas, where we stayed for
seven days.
Paul Raises Eutychus
On the first day of
the week, as †the disciples
were gathered together to
break bread, Paul addressed
them, intending to depart
the next day, and he pro-
longed his message until
midnight. 8 Now there were
many lamps in the upper
room where ‡we were gath-
ered together, 9 and a young
man named Eutychus, who
was sitting on the window
sill, sank into a deep sleep
while Paul continued speak-
ing for a long time. Over-
come by sleep, he fell down
from the third story and was
picked up dead. 10 But Paul
went down and threw him-
self on the young man. Tak-
ing him in his arms, he said,
“Do not be alarmed, for his
life is in him.” 11 Then Paul
went back upstairs, and af-
ter he had broken bread and
eaten, he conversed with the
disciples for a long time,
until dawn; that was how
he departed. 12 And they
brought the boy home alive
and were comforted beyond
measure.

THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20:21
we went §to the
ship and set sail for Assos,
intending to take Paul on
board there, for that is what
he had arranged, since he
himself intended to go by
land. 14 When he met us
in Assos, we took him on
board and went to Mitylene.
15 We set sail from there and
arrived off Chios on the fol-
lowing day. The next day we
reached Samos *and stayed
in Trogyllium, and the day
after that we came to Mile-
tus. 16 For Paul had decided
to sail past Ephesus so as
not to spend time in Asia,
because he was hurrying to
arrive in Jerusalem, if possi-
ble, by the day of Pentecost.
13 Then
Paul's Farewell Address to
the Ephesian Elders
17 From Miletus Paul sent
to Ephesus and called for
the elders of the church.
18 When they came to him,
he said to them, “You your-
selves know how I lived the
whole time I was with you,
from the day I first set foot in
Asia, 19 serving the Lord with
all humility and with †many
tears and trials, which came
upon me because of the

voyage from Tyre, we ar-
rived at Ptolemais.
After
greeting the brothers, we
stayed with them for one
day. 8 The next day §Paul
and his companions left and
went to Caesarea. We en-
tered the house of Philip the
evangelist, who was one of
the seven, and stayed with
him. 9 (He had four virgin
daughters who prophesied.)

for several days, a prophet

and binding his own *feet
and hands, he said, “Thus
says the Holy Spirit, ‘In this
way the Jews in Jerusalem
will bind the man who owns
this belt and deliver him
into the hands of the Gen-
tiles.’ ” 12 When we heard
this, we and the local resi-
dents urged Paul not to go up
to Jerusalem. 13 †But Paul re-
sponded, “What are you do-
ing, weeping and breaking
my heart? For I am ready
not only to be imprisoned,
but even to die in Jerusalem
for the name of the Lord
Jesus.” 14 Since he would
not be persuaded, we said,
“The Lord's will be done,”
and then we kept silent.
Paul's
Journey
to
Jerusalem
1 After we parted from
them and set sail, we fol-
lowed a straight course and
came to Cos.
The next
day we reached Rhodes,
and from there we went to
Patara. 2 When we found a
ship crossing over to Phoeni-
cia, we went on board and
set sail. 3 After coming in
sight of Cyprus, we passed it
on the left, sailed to Syria,
and arrived at Tyre, for
there the ship was to un-
load its cargo. 4 Then we
found *some disciples and
stayed there for seven days.
Through the Spirit they kept
telling Paul not to †go up
to Jerusalem, 5 but when
our days there came to an
end, we left and went on
our way. All the disciples
accompanied us, along with
their wives and children, un-
til we were outside of the
city. ‡Then we knelt down
on the beach and prayed.

another, we got on board the
ship, and they returned to

After those days we
packed up our belongings
and went up to Jerusalem.
16 Some of the disciples
from Caesarea went with us,

named Mnason, an early dis-
ciple, with whom we were to
stay.

Paul took the men, and on
the next day he purified
himself with them and
went to the temple, giving
notice of when the days of
their purification would be
completed and the offering
would be presented for each
of them.
Paul Visits James
When we arrived in
Jerusalem,

30 Then the entire city was
in an uproar, and the peo-
ple rushed together. They
seized Paul and dragged him
out of the temple courts,
and the gates were immedi-
ately shut. 31 But as they
were trying to kill him, a
report went up to the com-
mander of the Roman co-
hort that all Jerusalem was
in an uproar. 32 At once
he took soldiers and cen-
turions and ran down to
them. When the mob saw
the commander and the sol-
diers, they stopped beating
Paul. 33 Then the comman-
der came up, took him into
custody, and commanded
him to be bound with two
chains. He then asked who
he was and what he had
done. 34 But some in the
crowd were shouting one
thing, and some were shout-
ing another, and since the
commander could not find
out any reliable information
because of the uproar, he or-
dered Paul to be taken away
to the barracks. 35 When
Paul reached the steps, he
had to be carried by the sol-
diers because of the violence
of the crowd. 36 For the

Paul Addresses the Crowd
Paul was about to
be brought into the bar-
racks, he said to the com-
mander, “Do I have per-
mission to *speak to yoʋ?”
The commander said, “Yoʋ
know how to speak Greek?
38 Then yoʋ are not the
Egyptian who before these
days incited a revolt and
led four thousand men of
the Assassins out into the
wilderness?” 39 Paul said,
“I am a Jewish man from
Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen
of an important city. Now
I beg yoʋ, let me speak to
the people.” 40 When the
commander gave him per-
mission, Paul stood on the
steps and motioned with his
hand to the people. When
there was a great hush, he
addressed them in the He-
brew language,

“Brothers and fathers,
listen to the defense I now
make to you.” 2 When they
heard that he was address-
ing them in the Hebrew lan-
guage, they became even
more quiet. Then he said,
3 “I am a Jewish man, born in
Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought

12 “Now a certain Ana-

to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive

said, ‘The God of our fa-

32 The next day, they let
the horsemen go on with
him, while they returned to
the barracks. 33 When the
horsemen came to Caesarea
and delivered the letter to
the governor, they presented
Paul to him as well. 34 After
the governor read the letter,
he asked what province Paul
was from. When he learned
that he was from Cilicia,
35 he said, “I will give yoʋ a
hearing once yoʋr accusers
have arrived.” Then he gave
orders for him to be kept at
Herod's headquarters.

cellent Felix, with the utmost
gratitude. 4 But so that I may
not detain yoʋ any further,
I request that, in yoʋr for-

us briefly. 5 For we have
found this man to be a pesti-

‡dissension among all the

of the Nazarenes. 6 He even
tried to desecrate the temple,

listened to him speak about
faith in *Christ. 25 But as
Paul was discussing righ-
teousness, self-control, and
the coming judgment, Felix
became frightened and said
in response, “Go away for
now, and when I get an op-
portunity I will call for yoʋ.”
26 At the same time he was
hoping that Paul would give
him †money, so that he might
release him. So he would
send for Paul quite often and
converse with him. 27 But
after two years had passed,
Felix was succeeded by Por-
cius Festus. And wishing
to gain favor with the Jews,
Felix left Paul in prison.

those among you who are
influential go down with me,
and if there is †any fault

charges against him.”
After staying among
them for ‡more than ten
days, Festus went down to
Caesarea. The next day he
sat on the judgment seat and
ordered Paul to be brought
in. 7 When Paul arrived,
the Jews who had come
down from Jerusalem stood
around him, bringing many
serious charges §against him
that they could not prove.
8 Then Paul said in his own
defense, “Neither against the
law of the Jews, nor against
the temple, nor against
Caesar have I committed
any offense.” 9 But Festus,
wishing to gain favor with
the Jews, responded to Paul,
“Are yoʋ willing to go up
to Jerusalem and *stand
trial before me there on
these charges?” 10 Paul said,

Paul's Trial Before Festus
1 Three days after arriv-

went up to Jerusalem from
Caesarea, 2 where the *high
priest and prominent Jew-
ish men presented their case
against Paul. 3 Asking for
a favor against Paul, they
urged Festus to summon him
to Jerusalem, because they
were planning an ambush to
kill him on the way. 4 But
Festus replied that Paul was
being kept in custody in
Caesarea, and that he him-

conferring with the council,
Festus answered, “Yoʋ have
appealed to Caesar;

Caesar yoʋ shall go.”
Festus
Consults
King
Agrippa
13 After several days had
passed, King Agrippa and
Bernice arrived at Caesarea
and greeted Festus. 14 Since
†the king was staying there
for several days, Festus pre-
sented Paul's case to him,
saying, “There is a man

oner by Felix.
I was in Jerusalem, the
chief priests and the el-
ders of the Jews presented
their case and asked for a
‡judgment against him. 16 I
answered them that it is not
the custom of the Romans
to hand §anyone over for
destruction before the ac-
cused faces his accusers and
has an opportunity to make
his defense concerning the
charges. 17 So when they
had assembled here, I did
not postpone the case, but
on the next day I sat on the
judgment seat and ordered
the man to be brought in.
18 When his accusers stood
up, they brought no charge
against him of *the sort I was
expecting. 19 Instead they
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25:24
had certain points of dis-
agreement with him about
their own religion and about
a man named Jesus who
was dead, but whom Paul
claimed was alive. 20 Since
I was at a loss as to how
to investigate †this matter, I
asked if he might be willing
to go to Jerusalem and stand
trial there on these charges.
21 But Paul appealed to be
kept in custody for the deci-
sion of His Majesty the Em-
peror, so I ordered him to be
held until I could send him
to Caesar.” 22 Then Agrippa
said to Festus, “I would like
to hear the man myself.”
Festus said, “Tomorrow yoʋ
will hear him.”
Paul Brought Before King
Agrippa
23 So the next day Agrippa
and Bernice came with great
pomp and entered the audi-
torium along with the mil-
itary commanders and the
distinguished men of the
city.
Then Festus gave
the command, and Paul
was brought in. 24 Festus
said, “King Agrippa and all
you men who are present
with us, you see this man,
concerning whom the en-
tire Jewish community has
appealed to me, both in
Jerusalem and here in this
place, crying out that he
ought not to live any longer.

25 But ‡when I found that he

him. 26 Yet I have nothing
definite to write to my lord

now I am standing trial be-
cause of my hope in the
promise God made to our
fathers, 7 a promise that our
twelve tribes hope to attain
as they earnestly serve him

this hope, ‡King Agrippa, I
am being accused by the
Jews. 8 Why is it deemed un-
believable by you that God
raises the dead?
9 “Indeed, I myself was
convinced that I ought to
do many things against the
name of Jesus of Nazareth.

did in Jerusalem. §I locked

in all the synagogues and
tried to force them to blas-

enraged against them, I pur-
sued them even to foreign
cities.
Paul's Defense Before
Agrippa
1 Then Agrippa said to
Paul, “Yoʋ have permission
to speak for yoʋrself.” So
Paul stretched out his hand
and began to make his de-
fense: 2 “I consider myself
fortunate that it is before
yoʋ, King Agrippa, that I
am about to make my de-
fense today concerning all
the things of which I am
being accused by the Jews,
3 especially since *yoʋ are
acquainted with all the cus-
toms and controversies of
the Jews. Therefore I beg
yoʋ to listen to me patiently.

Paul Tells of His Preach-
ing to Jews and Gentiles
19 “Consequently,
King
Agrippa, I was not dis-
obedient to the heavenly
vision, 20 but first to those
in Damascus and *then to
those in Jerusalem, to all
the region of Judea and to
the Gentiles, I proclaimed
that they should repent and
turn to God, doing works
consistent with repentance.
21 That is why †the Jews
seized me ‡in the temple
courts and were trying to kill
me. 22 But having obtained
help from God, I stand to this
day testifying to both small
and great, saying nothing
except what the Prophets
and Moses said would take
place: 23 that the Christ
would suffer and that, as the
first to rise from the dead, he
would proclaim light §to our
people and to the Gentiles.”
24 As Paul was saying these
things in his own defense,
Festus said with a loud voice,
“Yoʋ are out of yoʋr mind,
Paul. Too much learning is
driving yoʋ insane!” 25 But
Paul said, “I am not out
of my mind, most excellent

28 Agrippa said to Paul, “Do
yoʋ think yoʋ can persuade
me to become a Christian
so quickly?” 29 Paul said,
“Whether quickly or not, I
pray to God that not only yoʋ
but also all who are listening
to me today would become
as I am, except for these
chains.”
30 †After Paul said these
things, the king stood up,
along with the governor,
Bernice, and those who
were sitting with them.
31 After leaving the room,
they began saying to one
another, “This man is doing
‡nothing that deserves death

Agrippa said to Festus,
“This man could have been

got on board a ship of
Adramyttium *and put out to
sea, intending to sail by the
ports along the coast of Asia.
With us was Aristarchus, a
Macedonian of Thessalonica.
3 The next day we put in
at Sidon, and Julius treated
Paul kindly, allowing him to
go to †his friends and receive
care. 4 From there we put
out to sea and sailed under
the lee of Cyprus, because
the winds were against us.
5 After sailing across the
open sea off Cilicia and Pam-
phylia, we arrived at Myra of
Lycia. 6 There the centurion
found an Alexandrian ship
that was sailing to Italy and
put us on board. 7 We sailed
along slowly for many days
and arrived with difficulty
off Cnidus. When the wind
did not allow us to hold
our course, we sailed under
the lee of Crete off Salmone.
8 Sailing along the coast with
difficulty, we came to a place
called Fair Havens, which
was near the city of Lasea.
9 Since much time had
been lost and the voyage
had now become dangerous
because the Fast was already
over, Paul advised the ship's
officers, 10 “Men, I perceive
that this voyage is going to
result in damage and great
loss, not only of the cargo
and of the ship, but also

of our lives.”

centurion was persuaded by
the ship's captain and the
shipowner rather than by
what Paul said. 12 Because
the harbor was not a suit-
able place for spending the
winter, the majority made
a decision to set sail from
there ‡also, hoping to some-
how reach Phoenix, a har-
bor of Crete facing south-
west and northwest, so that
we could spend the winter
there.
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27:27
next day, because we were
being
severely
battered
by the storm, the sailors
began throwing the cargo
overboard. 19 On the third
day ‡we threw the ship's
tackle overboard with our
own hands. 20 When neither
sun nor stars appeared for
many days, and the violent
storm continued to rage, all
hope that we might be saved
was lost.
21 Since there had been
little desire to eat, Paul stood
up among them and said,
“Men, you should have lis-
tened to my advice not to
set sail from Crete; then you
would have spared your-
selves this damage and loss.
22 But now I advise you to be
of good cheer, for there will
be no loss of life among you,
but only of the ship. 23 For
this very night an angel of
the God to whom I belong
and whom I serve stood be-
side me 24 and said, ‘Do not
be afraid, Paul; yoʋ must
stand before Caesar. And
behold, God has granted yoʋ
the safety of all who are sail-
ing with yoʋ.’ 25 Therefore
be of good cheer, men, for I
have faith in God that it will
happen just as I have been
told. 26 But we must run
aground on some island.”

to it and were driven along.
16 Running under the lee of a
small island called †Clauda,

hoisting it up, the sailors
used supports to undergird

was driven along. 18 The

Paul said to the centurion
and the soldiers, “If these

the sailors did not recognize
the land. But they noticed
a bay with a beach and de-
cided that, if *possible, they
would †run the ship ashore
there. 40 So they cut away
the anchors and left them
in the sea, at the same time
loosening the bands of the
rudders. Then they hoisted
the foresail up into the blow-
ing wind and made for the
beach. 41 But they struck
a sandbar and ran the ship
aground. The bow stuck fast
and remained immovable,
and the stern was being bro-
ken apart by the ‡force of
the waves. 42 The soldiers'
plan was to kill the prison-
ers, so that none of them
would swim away and es-
cape. 43 But the centurion,
wishing to save Paul's life,
kept them from carrying out
their plan. So he ordered
those who could swim to

you to take some food, for
this is important for †your

this, Paul took some bread

Paul Addresses the Jews in
Rome
17 After three days, Paul
called together those who
were prominent among the
Jews. When they had gath-
ered together, he said to
them, “Brothers, though I
had done nothing against
our people or the customs of
our fathers, I was delivered
as a prisoner from Jerusalem

amined me, they were will-
ing to release me because
there were no grounds for
death in my case. 19 But
when the Jews objected, I
was forced to appeal to Cae-
sar, not that I had any ac-
cusation to make against my
own nation. 20 That is why
I have asked to see you and
speak with you, for it is
on account of the hope of
Israel that I am bound with
this chain.” 21 They said to
him, “We have received no
letters from Judea about yoʋ,
and none of the brothers

who have come here have

bad about yoʋ. 22 But we
think it would be best to
hear what yoʋr views are,
for concerning this sect, we
know that everywhere it is
spoken against.”
23 When they had ar-
ranged a day to meet with
Paul, many more came to
him at his lodging. From
morning until evening he ex-
plained the matter to them,
testifying about the kingdom
of God and trying to con-
vince them about Jesus both
from the Law of Moses and
from the Prophets. 24 Some
were convinced by what he
said, but others refused to
believe. 25 So they were in
disagreement with one an-
other and began to leave af-

statement: “The Holy Spirit

Greeting
1 Paul, a servant of *Jesus
Christ, called to be an
apostle, set apart for the
gospel of God, 2 which
he promised beforehand
through his prophets in the
holy Scriptures, 3 concerning
his Son, who was descended
from David according to
the flesh 4 and who was
declared to be the Son of
God in power according
to the Spirit of holiness
by the resurrection from
the dead, Jesus Christ our
Lord, 5 through whom we
have received grace and
apostleship to bring about
the obedience of faith for
the sake of his name among
all the Gentiles, 6 including
you who are also called to
belong to Jesus Christ; 7 to all
who are in Rome, beloved by
God and called to be saints:
Grace to you and peace from
God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
Paul's Desire to Visit
Rome
8 First, I give thanks to my
God through Jesus Christ for
you all, because your faith is
proclaimed in all the world.
9 For God is my witness,
whom I serve with my spirit
in the gospel of his Son,
* 1:1 Jesus Christ ¦ Christ Jesus NA SBL
that I continually remember
you, 10 always pleading in
my prayers that somehow by
God's will I may now at last
succeed in coming to you.
11 For I long to see you so
that I may impart to you
some spiritual gift, that you
may be established, 12 that is,
that while I am among you
we may be mutually encour-
aged by each other's faith,
both yours and mine. 13 I do
not want you to be unaware,
brothers, that I have often
intended to come to you (but
have been hindered until the
present time) so that I might
have some fruit among you
as well, just as I have had
among the other Gentiles.
14 I am under obligation both
to Greeks and to barbarians,
both to the wise and to the
foolish; 15 thus the eagerness
on my part to preach the
gospel to you also who are in
Rome.
The Power of the Gospel
16 For I am not ashamed of
the gospel †of Christ, because
it is the power of God for
salvation to everyone who
believes, both to the Jew first
and also to the Greek. 17 For
in it the righteousness of
God is revealed from faith
to faith, just as it is written,
“The righteous will live by
faith.”
God's Wrath Against Un-
righteousness
18 For the wrath of God
is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and

who suppress the truth
by their unrighteousness.
19 Because what is known
about God is evident among
them, for God has made it
evident to them. 20 For his
invisible qualities, both his
everlasting power and his
divinity, have been plainly
seen from the creation of
the world, being perceived
through what has been
made, so that they are with-
out excuse. 21 For although
they knew God, they did not
glorify him as God or give
thanks, but they became

23 and ‡exchanged the glory
of the immortal God for
images resembling mortal

24 Therefore God gave
them up in the lusts of
their hearts to impurity, to
dishonor their bodies among
themselves, 25 because they
exchanged the truth of God
for falsehood and worshiped
and served the creature
rather than the Creator, who
is blessed forever. Amen.
26 For this reason God gave
them up to dishonorable
passions, for their women
exchanged the natural func-
tion for that which is con-
trary to nature. 27 In the
same way the men also, hav-
ing abandoned the natural
function of the female, were
inflamed in their lust for
one another, men commit-
ting shameful acts with men
and receiving in themselves
the due penalty for their er-
ror.

sidered it worthless to have

ness, §fornication, evil, cov-
etousness, and malice. They
are full of envy, murder,
strife, deceit, and malicious-
ness.
They are gossips,
30 slanderers, haters of God,
insolent, proud, boasters, in-
ventors of evil, disobedient
to parents, 31 senseless, un-
trustworthy, without natu-
ral affection, *irreconcilable,

they know the ordinance of
God, that those who practice
such things deserve death,
they not only do them but
also approve of those who
practice them.

25 Circumcision does in-
deed benefit yoʋ if yoʋ ob-
serve the law, but if yoʋ
transgress the law, yoʋr cir-

27 Then he who

and carries out the law will
judge yoʋ who, despite hav-
ing the letter of the law and
circumcision, transgress the

who is one outwardly, nei-
ther is circumcision some-
thing outward in the flesh;
29 but he is a Jew who is one
inwardly, and circumcision
is a matter of the heart, by
the Spirit, not by the letter.
Such a man's praise comes
not from men but from God.

tage of the Jew? Or what

of God?
Rather, let God be true even
if every man is a liar, just as
it is written,
“So that yoʋ may be justified
in yoʋr words,
and prevail when yoʋ are
judged.”
5 But if our unrighteousness
demonstrates the righteous-
ness of God, what shall we
say? Is God, who inflicts
wrath, unrighteous? (I speak
in a human way.) 6 Certainly
not! Otherwise, how could
God judge the world? 7 *For

not say (just as some slan-
derously claim that we say),
“Let us do evil that good may
come”? Their condemnation
is just.
No One is Righteous
What then?
Are we
Jews any better off? Not
at all! For we have previ-
ously charged that both Jews
and Greeks are all under sin,
10 just as it is written,
9
“There is none righteous,
not even one;
11 there is none who under-
stands;
there is none who seeks af-
ter God.THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 3:12294THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 3:31
12 All have turned aside; to-
gether they have be-
come useless;
there is none who shows
kindness,
not even one.”
13 “Their throat is an open
grave;
with their tongues they de-
ceive.”
“The venom of asps is under
their lips.”
14 “Their mouth is full of
cursing and bitter-
ness.”
15 “Their feet are swift to
shed blood.
16 Ruin and misery are in
their paths,
17 and the way of peace they
have not known.”
18 “There is no fear of God
before their eyes.”
19 Now we know that
whatever the law says, it
says to those who are under
the law, so that every mouth
may be stopped and all the
world may be brought under
the judgment of God. 20 For
by the works of the law no
flesh will be justified in his
sight, for through the law
comes knowledge of sin.
Justification by Faith
21 But now the righteous-
ness of God has been re-
vealed apart from the law,
attested by the Law and the
Prophets, 22 that is, the righ-
teousness of God through
faith in Jesus Christ for all
† 3:22 and upon all 92.6% ¦ — CT 6.6%
†and upon all who believe;
for there is no distinction.
23 For all have sinned and
fall short of the glory of
God, 24 being freely justi-
fied by his grace through
the redemption that is in
Christ Jesus, 25 whom God
put forward as a sacrifice of
atonement, through faith, by
his blood. He did this to
demonstrate his righteous-
ness, because in his divine
forbearance he had passed
over the sins that had previ-
ously been committed. 26 He
did so to prove in the present
time that he is righteous and
that he justifies the one who
has faith in Jesus.
27 Where then is boasting?
It is excluded. By what kind
of law? By a law of works?
No, but by the law of faith.
28 ‡We conclude therefore
that a person is justified by
faith apart from the works
of the law. 29 Or is God the
God of the Jews only? Is he
not the God of the Gentiles
also? Yes, of the Gentiles
also, 30 since God is one, who
will justify the circumcised
by faith and the uncircum-
cised through faith. 31 Do we
then nullify the law through
faith? Certainly not! On the
contrary, we uphold the law.

1 What then shall we say
*that Abraham our father
has discovered according to
the flesh? 2 If Abraham was
justified by works, he has
something to boast about,
but not before God. 3 For
what does the Scripture say?
“Abraham believed God, and
it was counted to him as
righteousness.” 4 Now to the
one who works, his wages
are not counted as a gift, but
as something owed to him.
5 However, to the one who
does not work but believes
in him who justifies the un-
godly, his faith is counted as
righteousness, 6 just as David
also speaks of the blessed-
ness of the one to whom God
counts righteousness apart
from works:
are those whose
lawless deeds are for-
given,
and whose sins are covered.
8 Blessed is the man against
whom the Lord will
never count sin.”

9 Is this blessedness then
only for the circumcised, or
is it also for the uncircum-
cised? For we say, “Faith
was counted to Abraham as
righteousness.” 10 How then
was it counted? When he
was circumcised, or uncir-
cumcised? Not when he was
circumcised, but when he
was uncircumcised. 11 He
received the sign of circum-
cision as a seal of the righ-
teousness that he had by
faith while he was still uncir-
cumcised, so that he might

be the father of all who be-
lieve when they are uncir-
cumcised, so that righteous-
ness might be counted to
them †as well, 12 and so that
he might be the father of
those who are not only cir-
cumcised in the flesh, but
who also walk in the foot-
steps of the faith that our
father Abraham had when
he was uncircumcised.
The Promise Granted
Through Faith
13 For the promise to Abra-
ham, or to his offspring, that
he would be the heir of the
world was not through the
law, but through the righ-
teousness of faith. 14 For if
those who are of the law are
heirs, faith has been made
void and the promise has
been invalidated, 15 because
the law brings wrath; ‡for
where there is no law, there
is no transgression.
16 For this reason the
promise comes by faith, so
that it may be according to
grace and be guaranteed to
all Abraham's offspring, not
only to the one who is of
the law, but also to the one
who is of the faith of Abra-
ham, who is the father of
us all 17 (just as it is writ-
ten, “I have made yoʋ the
father of many nations”). He
is our father in the pres-
ence of the God in whom
he believed, who gives life
to the dead and calls into
being what does not yet ex-
ist. 18 Against all hope Abra-
ham believed in hope that
‡ 4:15 for ¦ but CTTHE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 4:19296THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 5:12
he would become the father
of many nations according
to what had been spoken:
“So shall yoʋr offspring be.”
19 Because he was not weak
in faith, he §did not consider
his own body, *now as good
as dead (since he was some-
where around a hundred
years old), or the deadness
of Sarah's womb. 20 And he
did not waver in unbelief
at the promise of God but
was strengthened in faith,
giving glory to God 21 and
being fully assured that God
was able to do what he
had promised. 22 Therefore,
“it was counted to him as
righteousness.” 23 Now the
statement “it was counted to
him” was not written only
for Abraham's sake, 24 but
for ours also.
It will be
counted to us who believe
in him who raised Jesus our
Lord from the dead, 25 who
was delivered up for our
trespasses and raised for our
justification.

in our tribulations, knowing
that tribulation produces
4 endurance
endurance,
produces proven character,
proven character produces
hope, 5 and hope does not
put to shame, because the
love of God has been poured
out into our hearts through
the Holy Spirit who has been
given to †us.
6 For when we were still
weak, at the right time
Christ died for the ungodly.
7 Rarely will anyone die for
a righteous person, though
perhaps for a good person
someone might even dare to
die. 8 But God demonstrated
his own love for us in that,
while we were still sinners,
Christ died for us. 9 How
much more then, since we
have now been justified by
his blood, will we be saved
from wrath through him!
10 For if, while we were
God's enemies, we were rec-
onciled to him through the
death of his Son, how much
more will we be saved by
his life now that we have
been reconciled! 11 Not only
that, but we also boast in
God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom we
have now received reconcil-
iation.
Peace with God Through
Faith
1 Therefore,
since we
have been justified by faith,
*we have peace with God

through sin, in this way
death has come to all men,
because all have sinned.
13 For until the law sin
was in the world, but sin
is not charged to anyone's
account when there is no
law. 14 Nevertheless, death
reigned from Adam until
Moses, even over those
whose sins were not like
the transgression of Adam,
who was a type of the one to
come.
15 But the gift is not like
the trespass. For if many
died through the trespass of
the one man, how much
more have the grace of
God and the gift by the
grace of the one man Jesus
Christ abounded to many!
16 And the gift cannot be
compared to the result of
the one man's sin; for the
judgment that arose from
one trespass brought con-
demnation, but the gift that
arose from many trespasses
brought justification. 17 For
if, by the trespass of the one
man, death reigned through
the one man, how much
more will those who re-
ceive the abundance of grace
and the gift of righteousness
reign in life through the one
man Jesus Christ!
18 So then, just as one
trespass led to condemna-
tion for all men, so one
act of righteousness leads
to justification and life for
19 For just as
all men.
many were made sinners
through the disobedience of
one man, so also many will
be made righteous through
the obedience of one man.
20 Now the law came in
so that the trespass might
abound.
But where sin
abounded, grace abounded
all the more, 21 so that
just as sin reigned in death,
so also grace might reign
through righteousness lead-
ing to eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord.
6
Dead to Sin, Alive in Christ
1 What then shall we say?
Should we continue in sin
so that grace may abound?
2 Certainly not!
How can
we who have died to sin still
live in it? 3 Or do you not
know that all of us who have
been baptized into Christ
Jesus have been baptized
into his death? 4 Therefore
we were buried with him
through baptism into death,
so that just as Christ was
raised from the dead by the
glory of the Father, we too
might walk in newness of
life.
5 For if we have become
united with him in the like-
ness of his death, we will
certainly also be united with
him in the likeness of his
resurrection. 6 For we know
that our old self has been
crucified with him so that
the body of sin might be
done away with, and we
might no longer be enslaved
to sin. 7 For he who has
died has been set free from
sin. 8 Now if we have died
with Christ, we believe that
we will also live with him.
9 For we know that Christ,THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 6:10298THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 7:3
having been raised from the
dead, dies no more; death
no longer has dominion over
him. 10 For the death that
he died, he died to sin once
for all; but the life that he
lives, he lives to God. 11 So
you also must consider your-
selves to be dead to sin but
alive to God in Christ Jesus
*our Lord.
12 Therefore do not let sin
reign in your mortal bod-
ies so that you obey †it
in the body's sinful desires.
13 And do not present your
members to sin as instru-
ments of unrighteousness,
but present yourselves to
God as alive from the dead,
and present your members
to God as instruments of
righteousness. 14 For sin will
have no dominion over you,
for you are not under law
but under grace.
Slaves to Righteousness
Should we
sin because we are not un-
der law but under grace?
16 Do you
Certainly not!
not know that when you
present yourselves to some-
one as obedient slaves, you
are slaves of the one whom
you obey, either of sin lead-
ing to death, or of obedi-
ence leading to righteous-
ness? 17 But thanks be to God
that, though you were slaves
of sin, you have become obe-
dient from the heart to the
pattern of teaching to which
you were entrusted, 18 and
having been set free from

* 6:11 our Lord 94.5% ¦ — CT 3.5%
sin, you have become slaves
to righteousness. 19 (I am
speaking in human terms
because of the weakness of
your flesh.)
For just as
you presented your mem-
bers as slaves to impurity
and to lawlessness leading
to more lawlessness, so now
present your members as
slaves to righteousness lead-
ing to sanctification.
20 For when you were
slaves of sin, you were free
with regard to righteous-
ness. 21 So what fruit did you
have at that time from the
things of which you are now
ashamed? The end result of
those things is death. 22 But
now that you have been set
free from sin and become
slaves of God, you have fruit
that leads to sanctification,
and the end result is eternal
life. 23 For the wages of sin
is death, but the gift of God
is eternal life in Christ Jesus
our Lord.

Released from the Law
1 Do you not know, broth-
ers (for I am speaking to
those who know the law),
that the law has dominion
over a person only as long
as he lives? 2 For a married
woman is bound by the law
to her husband as long as he
is alive, but if her husband
dies, she is released from
the law concerning her hus-
band. 3 So then, she will be
called an adulteress if she is
† 6:12 it in 81.1% ¦ — CT 7.5%THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 7:4299THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS 7:20
joined to another man while
her husband is alive. But
if her husband dies, she is
free from that law and is not
committing adultery if she is
joined to another man.
4 So then, my brothers, you
also were put to death with
respect to the law through
the body of Christ, so that
you might be joined to an-
other, to him who was raised
from the dead, so that we
might bear fruit for God.
5 For when we were in the
flesh, our sinful passions,
which were aroused by the
law, were at work in our
members to bear fruit lead-
ing to death. 6 But now we
have been released from the
*law, having died to that by
which we were held, so that
we may serve in the new
way of the Spirit and not in
the old way of the written
code.
The Law and Sin
7 What then shall we say?
came to life and I died.
10 So I found that the very
commandment that was in-
tended to bring life actu-
ally brought death. 11 For
sin, seizing an opportunity
through the commandment,
deceived me and through it
killed me. 12 So then, the law
is holy, and the command-
ment is holy, righteous, and
good.
13 †Has that then which is
good brought death to me?
Certainly not! But sin, so
that it would be shown to
be sin, produced death in
me through that which is
good, so that through the
commandment sin might be-
come utterly sinful. 14 For
we know that the law is spir-
itual, but I am of the flesh,
sold as a slave to sin. 15 I
do not understand what I do.
Instead of doing what I want
to do, I do the very thing I
hate. 16 Now if I do the very
thing I do not want to do, I
agree that the law is good.
17 But now it is no longer I
who do it, but sin that dwells
in me. 18 For I know that
nothing good dwells in me,
that is, in my flesh. I have
the desire to do what is right,
but ‡I find that the ability to
carry it out is lacking. 19 For
I do not do the good that I
want to do, but I do the very
evil that I do not want to do.
20 Now if I do the very thing
I do not want to do, it is no

not! Yet I would not have
known sin except through
the law. For I would not

shall not covet.”
sin, seizing an opportunity
through the commandment,
produced in me every kind
of covetousness. For apart
from the law sin is dead.

from the law, but when
the commandment came, sin

21 I find then the law that
when I want to do what is
right, evil is present with me.
22 For I delight in the law of
God in my inner being, 23 but
I see another law at work
in my members, warring
against the law of my mind
and making me a prisoner to
the law of sin that is in my
members. 24 Wretched man
that I am! Who will rescue
me from this body of death?

do so through Jesus Christ

mind I serve the law of God,
but with my flesh I serve the
law of sin.
to the flesh but according to
the Spirit. 5 For those who
live according to the flesh set
their minds on the things of
the flesh, but those who live
according to the Spirit set
their minds on the things of
the Spirit. 6 Now the mindset
of the flesh is death, but the
mindset of the Spirit is life
and peace. 7 The mindset of
the flesh is hostile to God, for
it does not submit to the law
of God; indeed, it is unable
to do so. 8 That is why those
who are in the flesh cannot
please God.

the flesh but in the Spirit,

led by the Spirit of God are
sons of God. 15 For you did
not receive a spirit of slavery
leading again to fear, but a
spirit of adoption as sons,
by which we cry out, “Abba!
Father!” 16 The Spirit him-
self testifies with our spirit
that we are children of God.
17 Now if we are children,
we are also heirs, heirs of
God and fellow heirs with
Christ, if indeed we suffer
with him so that we may also
be glorified with him.
Future Glory
18 I consider that the suf-
we were saved. Now hope
that is seen is not hope, for
*why would someone hope
for what he already sees?
25 But if we hope for what
we do not see, we eagerly
wait for it with patient en-
durance.
26 In the same way the
Spirit also helps us in our
†weaknesses. For we do not
know what we ought to pray
for, but the Spirit himself
intercedes ‡for us with inex-
pressible groanings. 27 And
he who searches the hearts
knows the mind of the Spirit,
because the Spirit intercedes
for the saints according to
the will of God. 28 And we
know that §all things work
together for the good of
those who love God and are
called according to his pur-
pose. 29 Because those whom
he foreknew he also fore-
ordained to be conformed
to the image of his Son, so
that he might be the first-
born among many broth-
ers. 30 And those whom he
foreordained, he also called;
and those whom he called,
he also justified; and those
whom he justified, he also
glorified.
ferings of this present time
are not worth comparing to
the glory that will be re-
vealed to us. 19 The creation
waits with eager longing for
the sons of God to be re-
vealed. 20 For the creation
was subjected to futility, not
willingly, but because of him
who subjected it, in hope
21 that the creation itself will
also be set free from the
slavery of corruption and
brought into the freedom of
the glory of the children of
God. 22 For we know that
all creation has been groan-

an accusation against those
whom God has chosen? It is
God who justifies. 34 Who is

that, he was †raised and is at

ceding for us. 35 Who can

of Christ? Can tribulation,
or distress, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or
danger, or sword? 36 As it is
written,
“For yoʋr sake we face death
all day long;
we are regarded as sheep for

Yet in all these things
we are more than con-
querors through him who
loved us. 38 For I am per-
suaded that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor
rulers, nor ‡powers, nor
things present, nor things
to come, 39 nor height, nor

thing, will be able to sepa-
rate us from the love of God
that is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.

God's Choice of Israel

I could wish that I myself
were accursed, cut off from
Christ for the sake of my
brothers, my kinsmen ac-
cording to the flesh. 4 They
are Israelites, and to them
belong the adoption as sons,
the glory, the covenants, the
giving of the law, the temple
service, and the promises.
5 To them belong the patri-
archs, and from them, ac-
cording to the flesh, came
the Christ, who is God over
all, blessed forever. Amen.
6 It is not as though the
word of God has failed. For
not all Israelites truly be-
long to Israel, 7 and not
all of Abraham's children
are his true descendants,
but, “Through Isaac yoʋr de-
scendants will be counted.”
8 That is, it is not the
children of the flesh who
are the children of God;
rather, the children of the
promise are counted as de-
scendants. 9 For this is what
God promised: “About this
time next year I will come,
and Sarah will have a son.”
10 Not only that, but when

“The older will serve the

“Jacob I loved, but Esau I

14 What then shall we say?
Is there injustice with God?
Certainly not! 15 For he says
to Moses, “I will have mercy
on whom I have mercy, and
I will have compassion on
whom I have compassion.”
16 So then, it does not depend
on human will or effort, but
on God's mercy. 17 For the
Scripture says to Pharaoh, “I
have raised yoʋ up for the
very purpose of showing my
power in yoʋ, so that my
name might be declared in
all the earth.” 18 So then,

Israel's Unbelief
30 What then shall we say?
That Gentiles who were not
pursuing righteousness have
obtained righteousness, that
is, the righteousness that is
by faith. 31 But Israel, al-
though they pursued a law
of righteousness, did not at-
tain ‡a law of righteousness.
32 Why? Because they did
not pursue it by faith, but as
though it were by works §of
the law. They stumbled over
the stone of stumbling, 33 as
it is written,
not submitted to God's righ-
teousness. 4 For Christ is
the end of the law so that
there may be righteousness
for everyone who believes.
Salvation for All Who Be-
lieve
5 Moses writes ‡about the
righteousness that is by the
law: “The person who does
these things will live by
them.” 6 But the righteous-
ness that is by faith speaks
like this: “Do not say in
yoʋr heart, ‘Who will go
up to heaven?’ ” (that is,
to bring Christ down) 7 “or,
‘Who will go down into the
abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring
Christ up from the dead).

16 But not all the Israelites
have obeyed the gospel. For
Isaiah says, “Lord, who has
believed our report?” 17 So
then, faith comes by hearing,
and hearing comes through
the word of †God.
18 But I ask, have they not
heard? On the contrary,
by a nation that has no un-
derstanding I will pro-
voke you to anger.”
20 And
Isaiah is even bold
enough to say,
“I was found by those who
were not seeking me;
I became known to those
who were not asking

21 But to Israel he says, “All
day long I have stretched out
my hands to a disobedient
and contrary people.”
11
God Has Not Rejected Is-
rael
1 I ask then, has God re-
jected his people? Certainly
not! For I too am an Israelite,
a descendant of Abraham, of
the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God
has not rejected his people
whom he foreknew. Do you
not know what the Scripture
says in the passage about
Elijah, how he pleads with

6 Now if it is by grace, it is no
longer by works, otherwise
grace would no longer be
grace. ‡But if it is by works,
it is no longer grace, other-
wise work would no longer
be work.
7 What then? Israel did not
obtain what it was seeking.
The chosen obtained it, but
the rest were hardened, 8 as
it is written,
“God gave them a spirit of
stupor,
eyes not to see
and ears not to hear,
down to this very day.”
9 And David says,
“Let their table become a
snare and a trap,
a stumbling block and a ret-
ribution to them.
10 Let their eyes be darkened
so that they cannot
see,
and keep their backs forever
bent.”
The Salvation of the Gen-
tiles
11 I ask then, did the Is-
raelites stumble so as to
fall? Certainly not! Rather,
by their trespass salvation
has come to the Gentiles,
to provoke Israel to jeal-
ousy. 12 Now if their tres-
pass means riches for the
world, and their loss means
riches for the Gentiles, how
much more will it mean
when their full number is
included?
13 Now I am speaking to
you who are Gentiles. Inas-
much as I am an apostle
to the Gentiles, I glorify my
ministry 14 if somehow I
provoke my own people to
jealousy and save some of
them. 15 For if their rejection
means reconciliation for the
world, what will their accep-
tance mean but life from the
dead? 16 If the dough offered
as firstfruits is holy, so is the
whole lump; and if the root
is holy, so are the branches.
17 Now if some of the
branches have been broken
off, and yoʋ, a wild olive
branch, have been grafted
in among them and have
become a fellow partaker of
the §root and richness of the

this mystery, lest you be

27 “And this will be my
covenant with them,
when I take away their sins.”

to being chosen, they are

that he might have mercy on

I urge you therefore,
brothers, by the mercies of
God, to present your bod-

eats only vegetables. 3 The
one who eats must not de-

we live, we live for the Lord;
and if we die, we die for the
Lord. Therefore, whether
we live or die, we belong to
the Lord. 9 For this reason

of God, and Sosthenes our

God in Corinth, to those who

been disclosed to me about
you, my brothers, by those
of Chloe's household, that
there are quarrels among
you. 12 What I mean is this:
One of you says, “I follow
Paul,” while another says, “I
follow Apollos,” or, “I fol-
low Cephas,” or, “I follow
Christ.” 13 Has Christ been
divided? Was Paul crucified
for you, or were you bap-
tized into the name of Paul?
14 I give thanks §to God that
I baptized none of you, ex-
cept Crispus and Gaius, 15 so
that no one may say that *I
baptized into my own name.
16 (I also baptized the house-
hold of Stephanas. Beyond
that, I do not recall if I bap-
tized anyone else.) 17 For
Christ did not send me to
baptize, but to preach the
gospel, and not with clever-
ness of speech, so that the
cross of Christ would not be
deprived of its power.
the grace of God that has
been given to you in Christ
Jesus. 5 For you have been
enriched in him in every
way, in all speech and all
knowledge, 6 just as the tes-
timony of Christ was con-
firmed among you, 7 so that
you are not lacking in any
gift as you eagerly await the
revelation of our Lord Jesus
Christ. 8 He will strengthen
you to the end, so that you
will be blameless on the day
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

18 For the message of the
cross is foolishness to those
who are perishing, but to us
who are being saved it is the
power of God. 19 For it is
written,
“I will destroy the wisdom of
the wise,
and the intelligence of the
intelligent I will nul-
lify.”
20 Where
is the wise man?
Where is the scribe? Where
is the debater of this age?
Has not God made the wis-
dom of †this world foolish?
21 For since, in the wisdom
of God, the world through its
wisdom did not know God,
it pleased God through the
foolishness of our proclama-
tion to save those who be-
lieve. 22 For Jews ask for
‡a sign and Greeks seek wis-
dom, 23 but we preach Christ
crucified, a stumbling block
to Jews and foolishness to
§Greeks, 24 but to those who
are called, both Jews and
Greeks, Christ is the power
of God and the wisdom of
God. 25 For the foolishness
of God is wiser than men,
and the weakness of God is
stronger than men.
26 Consider your calling,
brothers, that not many of
you were wise according to
the flesh, not many were
powerful, not many were
of noble birth. 27 But God
chose the foolish things of
† 1:20 this ¦ the CT

the world to shame the wise,
and God chose the weak
things of the world to shame
28 God chose
the strong.
what is lowly and despised
in the world, things that
are regarded as nothing, to
nullify the things that are
regarded as something, 29 so
that no flesh might boast
before God. 30 It is because
of him that you are in Christ
Jesus, who has become for
us wisdom from God, and
in whom we have righteous-
ness, sanctification, and re-
demption. 31 Therefore, as
it is written, “Let him who
boasts, boast in the Lord.”

Proclaiming Christ Cruci-
fied
1 When I came to you,
brothers, I did not come
proclaiming to you the
*testimony of God with lofty
speech or wisdom. 2 For I
resolved to know nothing
among you except Jesus
Christ and him crucified. 3 I
came to you in weakness
and fear, and with much
trembling. 4 And my word
and my preaching were not
with †persuasive words of
human wisdom, but with a
demonstration of the Spirit
and of power, 5 so that your
faith would not be based on
the wisdom of men, but on
the power of God.

Spiritual Wisdom
we speak wisdom
among the mature, but not
a wisdom of this age or of
the rulers of this age, who
are being brought to noth-
ing. 7 On the contrary, we
speak the hidden wisdom of
God in a mystery, which God
foreordained for our glory
before time began. 8 None
of the rulers of this age un-
derstood this wisdom, for if
they had understood it, they
would not have crucified the
Lord of glory. 9 But, as it is
written,
6 Now
“No eye has seen, no ear has
heard,
and no heart has imagined
‡what God has prepared for
those who love him.”
1 Corinthians 3:4
by the †Holy Spirit, interpret-
ing spiritual things to spiri-
tual people.
14 The natural man does
not accept what comes from
the Spirit of God, because
it is foolishness to him; he
is not able to understand
it because it is spiritually
discerned. 15 But he who
is spiritual makes judgments
about all things, and yet he
himself is not subject to any
man's judgment. 16 “For who
has known the mind of the
Lord so as to advise him?”
But we have the mind of
Christ.

6 Now, brothers, I have ap-
plied these things to myself
and Apollos for your sake,
so that through us you may
learn †not to think beyond
what is written, so that you
may not be puffed up, with
each one of you supporting
one man against another.
7 For who regards yoʋ as
superior? What do yoʋ have
that yoʋ did not receive?
And if yoʋ received it, why
do yoʋ boast as though yoʋ
did not receive it?
8 You are already full! You
have already become rich!
You have begun to reign
without us!
And how I
wish that you really were
reigning, so that we could
reign with you! 9 For I think
that God has put us apos-
tles on display at the end of
the procession, as sentenced
to death, because we have
become a spectacle to the
world, both to angels and

are fools for
the sake of Christ, but you
are wise in Christ. We are
weak, but you are strong.
You are esteemed, but we
are dishonored. 11 To the
present hour we hunger and
thirst; we are poorly clothed
and beaten down, with no
home of our own. 12 We
labor, working with our own
hands. When we are reviled,
we bless; when we are per-
secuted, we endure; 13 when
we are slandered, we en-
courage. We have become
like the refuse of the world,
the scum of all things, even
to this present time.
14 I am not writing this
to shame you, but rather
‡I

15 For even if you had
ten thousand guardians in

Jesus I became a father

16 Therefore I urge you to
be imitators of me. 17 That
is why I have sent you
Timothy, who is my beloved
and faithful child in the
Lord. He will remind you
of my ways in §Christ, just
as I teach them everywhere
in every church. 18 But some
of you have become puffed

wills, and I will find out not

with old leaven, nor with
the leaven of malice and

9 I wrote to you in my let-
ter not to associate with for-

now I am writing to you
not to associate with anyone
who is named as a brother if
he is a fornicator or greedy,
an idolater or a reviler, a
drunkard or a swindler; do
not even eat with such a
man. 12 For what have I to do
with judging those who are
outside the church? Do you
not judge those who are in-
side the church? 13 God *will
judge those who are outside
the church. “†Therefore you
must remove the evil person
from among you.”

Principles of Marriage
1 Now concerning the mat-
ters about which you wrote
*to me: “It is good for a man
not to touch a woman.” 2 But
because of the cases of for-
nication, each man should
have his own wife, and
each woman should have
her own husband. 3 The
husband should fulfill his
marital duty to his wife,
and likewise the wife to her
husband. 4 The wife does
not have authority over her
own body, but the husband
does. Likewise the husband
does not have authority over
his own body, but the wife
does. 5 Do not deprive one
another, except by mutual
consent for a time, so that
you may devote yourselves
to †fasting and ‡prayer and
then come together again so
that Satan may not tempt
you because of your lack of
6 Now I say
self-control.
this as a concession, not as
a command. 7 §For I wish
that all people were as I am.
But each has his own gift
1 Corinthians 7:16
from God, one person *in
this manner and another in
that manner.
8 Now to the unmarried
and the widows I say: It is
good for them if they remain
even as I am. 9 But if they
cannot exercise self-control,
they should marry. For it is
better to marry than to burn
with passion.
10 Now to the married I
give this command (not I,
but the Lord): A wife must
not separate from her hus-
band 11 (but if she does sep-
arate, she must remain un-
married or else be recon-
ciled to her husband), and
a husband must not divorce
his wife.
12 Now to the rest I say
this (I, not the Lord): If any
brother has an unbelieving
wife, and she consents to
dwell with him, he must not

woman has an unbelieving
husband and he consents to
dwell with her, she must not
divorce him. 14 For the unbe-
lieving husband is sanctified
through his wife, and the un-
believing wife is sanctified
through †her husband. Oth-
erwise your children would
be unclean, but as it is, they
are holy. 15 But if the un-
believing spouse separates,
let it be so. The brother or
the sister is not enslaved in
such cases. God has called
‡us to live in peace. 16 For

1 Corinthians 7:33
The Unmarried and the
Widowed
25 Now concerning virgins,
I do not have a command
from the Lord, but I give
my judgment as one who has
been shown mercy by the
Lord to be trustworthy. 26 I
think it is good then, on ac-
count of the present distress,
for a man to remain as he is.
27 Are yoʋ pledged to marry
a woman? Do not seek to be
released. Are yoʋ free from
such a commitment? Do not
seek a wife. 28 But even
if yoʋ do marry, yoʋ have
not sinned. And if a virgin
marries, she has not sinned.
But those who marry will
have tribulation in the flesh,
and I am trying to spare you.
29 But I say this, brothers:
The time is short. From now
on those who have wives
should live as though they
had none, 30 and those who
weep as though they were
not weeping, and those who
rejoice as though they were
not rejoicing, and those who
buy as though they did not
possess, 31 and those who
use †this world as though
they were not making full
use of it. For the form of this
world is passing away.
32 But I want you to be
free from concern. The un-
married man is concerned
about the affairs of the Lord,
how he ‡will please the Lord.
33 But the married man is
concerned about the affairs
of the world, how he §will
Live as You Are Called
Nevertheless,
each
person should live the life
that §God has assigned to
him and to which *the Lord
has called him. This is the
rule I lay down in all the
churches. 18 Was any man
already circumcised when
he was called? He should
not remove the marks of
circumcision.
Was any
man uncircumcised when
he was called? He should
not become circumcised.
19 Circumcision is nothing,
and
uncircumcision
is
nothing, but what matters is
keeping the commandments
20 Each person
of God.
should remain in the calling
in which he was called.
21 Were yoʋ a slave when
yoʋ were called? Do not
be concerned about it, but
if yoʋ are able to become
free, make the most of the
opportunity. 22 For he who
was called in the Lord as a
slave is the Lord's freedman.
In the same way, he who
was called as a free man is
Christ's slave. 23 You were
bought with a price; do
not become slaves of men.
24 Brothers,
each person
should remain with God in
the condition in which he
was called.

a difference between †a wife
and a virgin. The unmarried
woman is concerned about
the affairs of the Lord, how
she may be holy both in
body and in spirit.
But
the married woman is con-
cerned about the affairs of
the world, how she ‡will
please her husband. 35 I say
this for your own benefit,
not to lay any restraint upon
you, but to promote proper
behavior and devotion to the
Lord without distraction.
36 Now if any man thinks
that he is acting improperly
toward his virgin daughter
by not letting her marry, if
she is past the bloom of her
youth and it seems neces-
sary to do so, he should do
what he wants. He is not
sinning by letting her get
married. 37 But the man
who stands firm in his heart,
who is under no compulsion
but has control over his own
will, and has determined in
his heart to keep his vir-
gin daughter from marrying,
§does well. 38 So then, he
who gives *her in marriage
does well, but he who does
not give her in marriage
†does better.
39 A wife is bound ‡by the
law to her husband for as
long as he lives. But if her
husband dies, she is free to

wishes, but only in the Lord.
40 Yet in my judgment she
is happier if she remains as
she is. §And I think that I too
have the Spirit of God.

Food Sacrificed to Idols
Now concerning food
sacrificed to idols, we know
that “we all have knowl-
edge.” Knowledge puffs up,
but love builds up. 2 If any-
one thinks he knows some-
thing, he has not yet come to
know *anything as he ought
to know it. 3 But if anyone
loves God, he is known by
God.
4 With regard then to eat-
ing food sacrificed to idols,
we know that “an idol is
nothing in the world,” and
that “there is no †other God
but one.” 5 For even if there
are so-called gods, whether
in heaven or on earth (as in-
deed there are many “gods”
and many “lords”), 6 for us
there is one God, the Fa-
ther, from whom are all
things, and we exist for him;
and there is one Lord, Jesus
Christ, through whom are all
things, and we exist through
him.
7 However, not everyone
possesses this knowledge.
But some ‡have idols in their

sin in this way against your
brothers and wound their

against Christ. 13 Therefore,

to stumble, I will certainly
never eat meat, so that I
will not cause my brother
to stumble.

1 Corinthians 9:11
Are you not my work in the
Lord? 2 If to others I am not
an apostle, at least I am to
you, for you are the seal of
my apostleship in the Lord.
3 This is my defense to
those who examine me. 4 Do
we not have a right to eat
and to drink? 5 Do we not
have a right to take along
a wife who is a sister in
Christ, as do the other apos-
tles, the brothers of the Lord,
and Cephas? 6 Or is it only
Barnabas and I who must
work to support ourselves?
7 Who at any time serves as
a soldier while supplying his
own provisions? Who plants
a vineyard and does not eat
‡of its fruit? §Or who tends
a flock and does not drink of
its milk?
8 Do I say this on human
authority?
Does not the
law also say the same thing?
9 For in the law of Moses it is
written, “Yoʋ shall not muz-
zle an ox while it is thresh-
ing.” Is it for oxen that God
is concerned? 10 Or does he
speak entirely for our sake?
Yes, this was written for our
sake, because he who plows
ought to plow in hope, and
he who threshes *in hope
ought to partake of his hope.

too much if we reap material
12 If
benefits from you?
others have a share in this
right over you, do not we
have it even more?
Nevertheless, we have not
made use of this right, but
we endure everything so
that we may not give any
hindrance to the gospel of
Christ. 13 Do you not know
that those who perform sa-
cred services eat of the tem-
ple sacrifices, and those who
attend to the altar have a
share in the altar sacrifices?
14 In the same way, the Lord
has commanded that those
who proclaim the gospel
should earn their living by
the gospel.
15 But I have not used
any of these rights, and I
am not writing this so that
such may be done in my
case. For I would rather die
†than have anyone deprive
me of my reason for boast-
ing. 16 If I preach the gospel,
I have no reason to boast,
because I am compelled to
preach, and woe to me if
I do not preach the gospel.
17 If I do this voluntarily,
I have a reward; but if I
do it under compulsion, it
is because I have been en-
trusted with a responsibility.
18 What then is my reward?
That when I preach, I may
present the gospel ‡of Christ
1 Corinthians 9:26
free of charge, so as not to
make full use of my right in
the gospel.
19 For though I am free
from all, I have made myself
a servant to all, in order
to win as many as possible.
20 To the Jews I became like
a Jew, so that I might win
the Jews. To those under the
law I became like one under
the §law, so that I might
win those under the law.
21 To those outside the law I
became like one outside the
law (though I am not outside
the law of God but under
the law of Christ), so that I
might win those outside the
law. 22 To the weak I became
*like one who is weak, so
that I might win the weak. I
have become all things to all
people, so that by all means I
might save some. 23 I do †this
for the sake of the gospel,
so that I may share in its
blessings.

a woman will not veil her-
self, she should cut off her
hair. But if it is disgraceful
for a woman to cut off her
hair or shave her head, she
should wear a veil. 7 For
a man ought not to have
his head veiled, since he is
the image and glory of God,
but woman is the glory of
man. 8 For man did not come
from woman, but woman
from man. 9 Neither was
man created for the sake of
woman, but woman for the
sake of man. 10 That is why
a woman ought to have a
symbol of authority on her
head, because of the angels.
11 Nevertheless, in the Lord
neither is †man independent
of woman nor woman in-
dependent of man. 12 For
just as woman came from
man, so also man is born of
woman, but all things come
from God. 13 Judge for your-
selves: Is it proper for a
woman to pray to God with
her head unveiled? 14 Does
not even nature itself teach
you that if a man has long
hair it is a disgrace to him,
15 but if a woman has long
hair it is her glory? For
her long hair is ‡given for a
covering. 16 But if anyone
is inclined to be contentious,
we have no such custom,
and neither do the churches
of God.
The Lord's Supper
17 Now in giving the fol-
lowing instructions, I do not
1 Corinthians 10:25
praise you, since you come
together not for the better,
but for the worse. 18 For in
the first place, I hear that
there are divisions among
you when you come together
as a church, and in some
part I believe it. 19 For there
must be factions among you
to show which of you are
approved. 20 Now when you
come together, it is not to
eat the Lord's supper. 21 For
when you eat, some of you
eat your own supper with-
out waiting for others. So
one person is hungry while
another gets drunk. 22 What!
Do you not have houses for
eating and drinking? Or do
you despise the church of
God and put to shame those
who do not have anything?
What should I say to you?
Should I praise you for this?
I do not praise you.
23 For I received from the
Lord what I also delivered
to you, that the Lord Je-
sus on the night in which
he was betrayed took bread,
24 and when he had given
thanks, he broke it and said,
“§Take and eat this bread;
this is my body, which
is *broken for you. Do
this in remembrance of
me.” 25 In the same way,
he also took the cup after
supper, saying, “This cup is
the new covenant in my
blood. Do this, as often

as you drink it, in remem-
brance of me.” 26 For as
often as you eat this bread
and drink †this cup, you pro-
claim the Lord's death until
he comes.
27 So then, whoever eats
‡this bread or drinks the cup
of the Lord in §a manner
unworthy of the Lord will be
guilty of the body and blood
of the Lord. 28 So a person
should examine himself be-
fore he eats of the bread and
drinks of the cup. 29 For he
who eats and *drinks in an
unworthy manner eats and
drinks judgment on himself,
since he shows no regard for
the body †of the Lord. 30 That
is why many among you are
weak and sick, and a consid-
erable number have fallen
asleep. 31 If we would evalu-
ate ourselves, we would not
be judged. 32 But when we
are judged by the Lord, we
are disciplined so that we
will not be condemned with
the world.
33 So then, my brothers,
when you come together to
eat, wait for one another.
34 If anyone is hungry, he
should eat at home, so that
when you come together it
will not result in condemna-
tion. I will set the remain-
ing matters in order when I
come.
1 Corinthians 12:10

Spiritual Gifts
1 Now concerning spiritual
gifts, brothers, I do not want
you to be uninformed. 2 You
know that *when you were
pagans you were somehow
enticed and led astray to
mute idols. 3 Therefore I
make known to you that no
one speaking by the Spirit
of God †calls Jesus accursed,
and no one can ‡call Je-
sus Lord except by the Holy
Spirit.
4 Now there are varieties
of gifts, but the same Spirit;
5 and there are varieties
of ministries, but the same
Lord; 6 and there are vari-
eties of activities, but it is the
same God who empowers all
of them in everyone. 7 A
manifestation of the Spirit

need of yoʋ,” nor in turn can
the head say to the feet, “I
have no need of you.” 22 On
the contrary, the members
of the body that seem to be
weaker are essential, 23 and
the members of the body
that we consider to be less
honorable are clothed with
more abundant honor. And
our unpresentable parts are
treated with greater mod-
esty, 24 but our presentable
parts have no need of it.
Instead, God has put the
body together, giving more
abundant honor to the part
that lacked it, 25 so that there
would be no †divisions in the
body, but that the members
would have the same con-
cern for one another. 26 If
one member suffers, all the
other members ‡suffer with
it; if §one member is hon-
ored, all the other members
*rejoice with it.
27 Now you are the body
of Christ, and individually
members of it. 28 And those
whom God has appointed
in the church are as fol-
lows:

ond prophets, third teach-
ers, next miracles, then gifts
of healing, helping, lead-
ing, and various kinds of

One Body with Many
Members
12 For just as the body is
one and has many members,
and all the members consti-
tute one body even though
they are many, so it is with
Christ. 13 For by one Spirit
we were all baptized into
one body—whether Jews or
Greeks, slave or free—and
we have all been given *to
drink into one Spirit.

others, and if I deliver up my
body *to be burned, but do
not have love, I receive no
benefit.
4 Love is patient and kind.
Love does not envy or boast.
It is not puffed up 5 or
rude. It does not seek its
own way, it is not irritable,
and it keeps no record of
wrongs. 6 It does not re-
joice over unrighteousness,
but rejoices with the truth.
7 It bears all things, believes
all things, hopes all things,
and endures all things.
8 Love never fails.
But
as for prophecies, they will
come to an end; as for
tongues, they will cease; as

for knowledge, it will come
to an end. 9 †Now we know
in part, and we prophesy in
part. 10 Yet when the perfect
comes, the partial will come
to an end. 11 When I was
a child, I spoke like a child,
I thought like a child, and I
reasoned like a child. But
when I became a man, I set
aside childish ways. 12 For
now we see in a mirror by
means of an obscure image,
but then we will see face
to face.
Now I know in
part, but then I will know
fully, just as I have been
fully known. 13 And now
faith, hope, and love abide,
these three; but the greatest
of these is love.

prophesies than he who
speaks in tongues, unless
someone interprets, so that
the church may be edified.
6 Now, brothers, if I come
to you speaking in tongues,
how will I benefit you un-
less I speak to you with a
revelation or knowledge or
prophecy or teaching? 7 It
is the same way with life-
less instruments that pro-
duce sound, such as the flute
or harp.
If they do not
produce distinct notes, how
will anyone recognize what
is being played? 8 And if
the trumpet does not pro-
duce a distinct sound, who
will prepare himself for bat-
tle? 9 It is the same with
you.
If you do not pro-
duce intelligible speech with
your tongue, how will any-
one know what you are say-
ing? You will just be speak-
ing into the air. 10 There
are undoubtedly many kinds
of languages in the world,
and none †of them is without
meaning. 11 If then I do
not know the meaning of a
particular language, I will
be a foreigner to him who
is speaking, and he who is
speaking will be a foreigner
to me. 12 It is the same with
you.
Since you earnestly
desire spiritual gifts, seek
to abound in them for the
edification of the church.
13 Therefore anyone who
speaks in a tongue should
pray for the ability to inter-

pret what he says. 14 For if
I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prays, but my mind is un-
fruitful. 15 What then should
I do? I will pray with my
spirit, but I will pray with my
mind also. I will sing praise
with my spirit, but I will
sing praise with my mind
also. 16 Otherwise, if yoʋ
bless with yoʋr spirit, how
will anyone in the position
of an outsider say “Amen”

he does not know what yoʋ

19 Nevertheless, in church
I would rather speak five

is written, “With foreign
tongues and with *foreign
lips I will speak to this peo-
ple, and even then they will
not listen to me, says the
Lord.” 22 So then, tongues
are a sign not for believers
but for unbelievers, while
prophecy is a sign not for
unbelievers but for believ-
ers. 23 So if the whole church
‡ 14:18 my ¦ — CT § 14:18 speaking
* 14:21 foreign lips ¦ the lips of foreigners CT1 Corinthians 14:24
334
comes together and every-
one is speaking in tongues,
and outsiders or unbelievers
come in, will they not say
that you are out of your
minds? 24 But if an unbe-
liever or outsider comes in
while everyone is prophesy-
ing, he will be convicted by
all and called to account by
all. 25 The secrets of his heart
will †thus be revealed, and
he will fall on his face and
worship God, declaring that
God is truly among you.
Orderly Worship
then should you
do, brothers?
When you
come together, each one ‡of
you has a psalm, a teach-
ing, a §tongue, a revelation,
or an interpretation.
Ev-
erything must be done for
edification. 27 If any speak in
a tongue, only two, or at the
most three, should speak;
they should each speak in
turn, and someone must in-
terpret. 28 But if there is
no interpreter, they should
keep quiet in the church and
speak in tongues privately
29 Two or three
to God.
prophets should speak, and
the others should evaluate
30 But if
what they say.
something is revealed to an-
other who is seated, the first
speaker should be silent.
31 For you can all proph-
esy one by one, so that all
26 What
1 Corinthians 15:1
may learn and all may be
encouraged. 32 Remember
that the spirits of prophets
are subject to the prophets.
33 For God is not a God of
disorder but of peace; this
is true in all the churches of
the saints.
34 *Your women should be
silent in the churches, for
they †have not been permit-
ted to speak, but must be
in submission, just as the
law says. 35 If they want to
learn anything, they should
ask their own husbands at
home; for it is shameful for
‡women to speak in church.
36 Or was it from you that
the word of God came? Or
are you the only ones it has
reached?
37 If anyone thinks that he
is a prophet or spiritual per-
son, he should acknowledge
that the things I am writing
to you are §commandments
of the Lord. 38 But if anyone
ignores this, *let him be ig-
norant. 39 So then, †brothers,
earnestly desire to prophesy
and do not forbid speaking
in tongues. 40 Let all things
be done decently and in or-
der.

which you received, in
which you stand, 2 and
by which you are being
saved, if you hold fast to the
message that I preached to
you—unless you believed in
vain.
3 For I delivered to you
as of first importance what
I also received: that Christ
died for our sins accord-
ing to the Scriptures, 4 that
he was buried, that he was
raised on the third day ac-
cording to the Scriptures,
5 and that he appeared to

peared to more than five
hundred brothers at once,
most of whom are still liv-
ing, but some have fallen
asleep. 7 Next he appeared
to James, then to all the
apostles. 8 Last of all, as
to one born at the wrong
time, he appeared to me as
well. 9 For I am the least
of the apostles, unworthy to
be called an apostle, because
I persecuted the church of
God. 10 But by the grace of
God I am what I am, and
his grace toward me was not
in vain. On the contrary,
I worked harder than all of
them, yet not I, but the grace
of God that was with me.
11 Whether then it was I or
they, this is what we preach,
and this is what you have
come to believe.
The Resurrection of the
Dead

1 Corinthians 15:24
12 Now
if it is preached
that Christ has been raised
from the dead, how can
some among you say that
there is no resurrection of
13 If there is

no resurrection of the dead,
then not even Christ has
been raised. 14 And if Christ
has not been raised, then
our preaching is in vain,
and *your faith is also in
vain. 15 We are even found
to be false witnesses about
God, because we have tes-
tified against God that he
raised Christ, whom he did
not raise if indeed the dead
16 For if
are not raised.
the dead are not raised, not
even Christ has been raised.
17 And if Christ has not been
raised, your faith is futile;
you are still in your sins.
18 Furthermore, those who
have fallen asleep in Christ
have also perished. 19 If for
this life only we have hoped
in Christ, we are of all people
most to be pitied.
20 But as it is, Christ has
been raised from the †dead;
he has become the firstfruits
of those who have fallen
asleep. 21 For since death
came through a man, the
resurrection of the dead has
also come through a man.
22 For just as all die in Adam,
so all will be made alive in
Christ. 23 But each in his
own order: Christ the first-
fruits, then, at his coming,
those who belong to Christ.

he hands the kingdom over
to God the Father, after he

put all his enemies under his

be abolished is death. 27 For
God “has put everything in
subjection under his feet.”
Now when it says that “ev-
erything has been put in sub-
jection,” it is evident that it
does not include God him-
self, who put everything in
subjection to Christ. 28 Now
when everything has been
subjected to him, the Son
himself will ‡also be sub-
jected to him who subjected
everything to him, so that
God may be all in all.

they come?” 36 Fool! What

what yoʋ sow is not the
body that will be, but a bare
kernel, perhaps of wheat or
some other grain. 38 But
God gives it a body just as
he has determined, and he
gives to each of the seeds its
own body. 39 Not all flesh
is the same flesh, but there
is one †kind for humans, an-

15 Brothers, you know that
the household of Stephanas

and that they have devoted
themselves to serving the
saints.
I urge you 16 to
submit to such people and to
everyone who joins together
in the work and labors with
them. 17 I rejoice over the
coming of Stephanas, For-
tunatus, and Achaicus, be-
cause these men have sup-

your part. 18 For they have
refreshed my spirit as well

to such men.

If we
are comforted, it is also for
your comfort and salvation,
7 because we know that just
as you share in our suffer-
ings, so also you share in our
comfort.
8 We do not want you to
be unaware, brothers, of the
affliction we experienced in
Asia. For we were so ut-
terly burdened beyond our
strength that we despaired
of life itself. 9 Indeed, we
felt that we had received
the sentence of death. But
this happened so that we
would not rely on ourselves,
but on God, who raises the
dead. 10 He rescued us from
such a terrible death, and
‡continues to rescue us. We
have put our hope in him
that he will rescue us yet
again 11 as you join in help-
ing us by your prayers. Then
many will give thanks on
§your behalf for the favor
granted to us through the
prayers of many.

us and put his Spirit in our
hearts as a guarantee.
23 But I call upon God as
a witness against me, that
the reason I did not return
to Corinth was to spare you.
24 Not that we rule over your
faith; rather, we work with
you for your joy, because by
faith you stand firm.
15 Because I was confident
of this, I intended to come to
you first, so that you would
‡be blessed by a second visit.
16 I wanted to visit you on my
way to Macedonia and re-
turn to you from Macedonia,
and then have you send me
on my way to Judea. 17 Was
I vacillating when I planned
to do this? Or do I make my
plans in a worldly manner,
ready to say “Yes” and “No”
at the same time? 18 But as
surely as God is faithful, our
message to you §did not wa-
ver between “Yes” and “No.”
19 For the Son of God, *Jesus
Christ, whom Silvanus, Tim-
othy, and I preached among
you, did not waver between
“Yes” and “No.”
On the
contrary, in him God's an-
swer has always been “Yes.”
20 For in him every one of
God's promises is †“Yes,” and
in him we say “Amen” to the
glory of God. 21 Now it is God
who establishes us with you
in Christ and who anointed1 So I made up my mind

that I would not come to you
again in sorrow. 2 For if I
make you sorrowful, who is
there to make me glad but
the one whom I have made
sorrowful? 3 That is why I
wrote *to you as I did, so that
when I came I would not
have sorrow from those who
ought to make me rejoice. I
had confidence about you all
that my joy would be yours.
4 For I wrote to you out of
great distress and anguish of
heart and with many tears,
not to cause you sorrow, but
to let you know the abun-
dant love I have for you.
Forgive the Sinner
Now if anyone has
caused sorrow, he has
caused it not to me, but in
some measure (not to put it
too severely) to all of you.

be overwhelmed with exces-

urge you to reaffirm your
love for him. 9 I wrote to
you because I wanted to test
your character and see if
you would be obedient in
everything. 10 Now if you
forgive anyone of anything,
I also forgive him. For ‡if
I have forgiven anyone of
anything, I have done it for
your sakes in the presence
of Christ, 11 so that we might
not be exploited by Satan.
For we are not ignorant of
his schemes.
Triumph in Christ
when I came to
Troas to preach the gospel
of Christ, a door was opened
for me in the Lord. 13 But
I had no rest in my spirit
because I did not find my
brother Titus. So I took leave
of the people there and went
on to Macedonia.
14 But thanks be to God,
who always leads us in tri-
umphal procession in Christ,
and through us spreads the
fragrance of the knowledge
of Christ everywhere. 15 For
we are a sweet fragrance
of Christ ascending to God
among those who are being
saved and among those who
are perishing; 16 to the lat-
ter we are a smell of death
leading to death, but to the
former we are a fragrance of
life leading to life. And who
12 Now
2 Corinthians 3:7
is equal to such a task? 17 For
we are not like §others who
peddle the word of God for
profit. On the contrary, in
Christ we speak with sincer-
ity in the presence of God, as
men sent from God.

Ministers of the New
Covenant
1 Are we beginning to com-
mend ourselves again? *Do
we need, as some do, letters
of recommendation to you
or †letters of recommenda-
tion from you? 2 You are our
letter, written on our hearts,
known and read by all. 3 You
show that you are a letter
from Christ, delivered by us,
written not with ink, but
with the Spirit of the living
God, not on stone tablets, but
on tablets of human hearts.
4 Such is the confidence
that we have in God through
Christ. 5 Not that we are
competent in and of our-
selves to claim that any-
thing comes from us, but
our competence comes from

competent to be ministers of
a new covenant, not of the
letter, but of the Spirit. For
the letter kills, but the Spirit
gives life.
7 Now if the ministry of
death, which was engraved
in letters on stone, came
with glory, so that the sons
of Israel could not gaze at

the face of Moses because of
its glory (a glory that was
fading away), 8 will not the
ministry of the Spirit be even
more glorious? 9 For if ‡the
ministry of condemnation
was glorious, the ministry
of righteousness abounds in
glory even more. 10 For what
was once glorious now has
no glory in comparison with
the glory that surpasses it.
11 And if what was fading
away came with glory, what
remains will be even more
glorious.
12 Therefore,
since we
have such a hope, we act
with great boldness. 13 We
are not like Moses, who
would put a veil over his
face so that the sons of Israel
would not gaze at the end
of what was fading away.
14 But their minds were
hardened, for to this day the
same veil remains unlifted
when the old covenant
is §read.
Only in Christ
is this veil taken away.
15 But to this day, *when
Moses is read, a veil lies
16 But

whenever someone turns to
the Lord, the veil is taken
away. 17 Now the Lord is
the Spirit, and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is
freedom. 18 And we all, with
‡ 3:9

unveiled faces reflecting the
glory of the Lord, are being
transformed into the same
image from one degree of
glory to another; this comes
from the Lord, who is the
Spirit.

Paul's Perseverance in
Ministry
1 Therefore, since we have
this ministry through God's
mercy, we do not lose heart.
2 Rather, we have renounced
shameful hidden deeds; we
do not act deceitfully or dis-
tort the word of God, but by
openly proclaiming the truth
we commend ourselves to
everyone's conscience in the
sight of God. 3 But even
if our gospel is veiled, it is
veiled among those who are
perishing. 4 The god of this
age has blinded the minds
of unbelievers like them, so
that *the light of the gospel
of the glory of Christ, who is
the image of God, might not
dawn upon them. 5 For what
we preach is not ourselves,
but †Christ Jesus as Lord,
and ourselves as your ser-
vants for Jesus' sake. 6 For

us the light of the knowledge
of the glory of God in the
face of §Jesus Christ.
7 But we have this treasure
in jars of clay, to show that
this extraordinary power is
from God and not from us.
8 We are afflicted in every
way, but not crushed; per-
plexed, but not in despair;
9 persecuted, but not for-
saken; struck down, but not
destroyed; 10 always carry-
ing about in our bodies the
death of *the Lord Jesus, so
that the life of Jesus may also
be revealed in our bodies.
11 For we who live are al-
ways being delivered up to
death for Jesus' sake, so that
the life of Jesus may also be
revealed in our mortal flesh.
12 So then, death is at work
in us, but life is at work in
you.
13 It is written, “I believed,
therefore I spoke.”
With
that same spirit of faith we
also believe, therefore we
also speak. 14 For we know
that he who raised †the
Lord Jesus will also raise us
‡through Jesus and bring us
with you into his presence.
15 All of this is for your
benefit, so that grace, as it
extends to more and more
people, may cause thanks-
giving to abound to the glory
of God.
2 Corinthians 5:9
away, on the inside we are
being renewed day by day.
17 For our light and mo-
mentary affliction is bring-
ing about for us an eternal
weight of glory far beyond
all measure, 18 as we look
not to what is seen, but to
what is unseen. For what is
seen is temporary, but what
is unseen is eternal.

1 Now we know that if the
earthly tent we live in is
destroyed, we have a build-
ing from God, an eternal
house in heaven, not made
2 For
by human hands.
in this tent we groan, long-
ing to be further clothed
with our heavenly dwelling,
3 *because when we are
clothed, we will not be found
naked. 4 For while we are
in this tent, we groan and
are burdened, not because
we want to be unclothed, but
further clothed, so that what
is mortal may be swallowed
up by life. 5 Now he who
has prepared us for this very
thing is God, who has †also
given us the Spirit as a guar-
antee.
6 Therefore
we have
courage at all times, and we
know that while we are at
home in the body we are
away from the Lord. 7 For
we walk by faith, not by
sight. 8 Yes, we have courage
and would rather be away
from the body and at home
with the Lord. 9 Therefore,

whether we are at home

evil.

2 Corinthians 5:3
17 Therefore, if anyone is in
Christ, he is a new creation.
Old things have passed
away; behold, †all things
have become new. 18 And all
these things are from God,
who reconciled us to himself
through ‡Jesus Christ and
gave us the ministry of
reconciliation, 19 namely,
that God was reconciling
the world to himself in
Christ, not counting people's
trespasses against them.
And he has committed to us
the message of reconcilia-
tion. 20 Therefore, we are
ambassadors for Christ, as
though God were making
an appeal through us. We
plead on Christ's behalf: “Be
reconciled to God.” 21 §For
God made him who did
not know sin to be a sin
offering for us, so that in
him we might become the
righteousness of God.
The Ministry of Reconcili-
ation

Macedonia.
severe trial of affliction,
their abundant joy and their
deep poverty abounded in
a wealth of generosity on
their part. 3 For I testify
that according to their
ability, and even beyond
their ability, they gave of
their own accord, 4 urgently
begging us †for the privilege
of contributing to the gift
for the saints in Jerusalem.
5 And they did not do this
in the way we expected, but
they gave themselves first
to the Lord and then to us
by the will of God. 6 So
we have urged Titus, who
previously encouraged you
to begin gathering money,
to return and help you
complete this gracious gift.
7 But just as you abound
in everything—in faith, in
speech, in knowledge, in
complete earnestness, and
in ‡your love for us—see that
you abound in this gracious
gift as well.
8 I am not saying this as
a command, but I want to
test the sincerity of your
love by comparing it with
the earnestness of others.
9 For you know the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that
though he was rich, yet for
§your sakes he became poor,
1 Now
2 Corinthians 8:18
so that by his poverty you
could become rich. 10 So I
am giving my advice about
what is best for you in
this matter. Last year you
were not only the first who
wanted to give, but you were
also the first to begin doing
so. 11 Now finish doing it, so
that your eager willingness
to give may be matched by
your completion of the gift,
according to what you have.
12 For if the eager willing-
ness is there, it is acceptable
according to what one has,
not according to what one
does not have. 13 I do not
mean there should be relief
for others and hardship for
you, but it is a matter of
equality. At the present time
your abundance should pro-
vide for their need, 14 so that
in turn their abundance may
provide for your need, and
thus there may be equality.
15 As it is written, “He who
gathered much had nothing
left over, and he who gath-
ered little had no lack.”
Titus and His Companions
thanks be to God,
who has put into the heart of
Titus the same earnest care
for you that I have. 17 For
Titus not only accepted our
appeal, but with great enthu-
siasm he is coming to you of
his own accord. 18 With him
we are sending the brother
who is praised by all the
churches for his preaching

of the gospel. 19 And not only
I know how eager you are
to help, and I keep boast-
ing about you to the Mace-
donians, saying that Achaia
has been prepared to give
since last year; and your
zeal has stirred up most of
them. 3 But I have sent the
brothers so that our boasting
about you in this matter may
not prove to be empty, but
that you may be prepared,
just as I said you would be.
4 Otherwise, if any of the
Macedonians were to come
with me and find you un-
prepared, we (not to men-
tion you) would be ashamed
*of this confident boasting.
5 So I thought it necessary
to urge the brothers to go
on ahead to you and arrange
in advance your previously
†announced blessing, so that
this gift of yours may be
ready as a blessing and not
as something you feel forced
to do.

Paul Defends His Ministry
myself ap-
peal to you by the meekness
and gentleness of Christ—I
who am humble when with
you face to face, but bold
toward you when absent! 2 I
ask that when I am present
I need not show boldness
by daring to oppose those
who think that we walk ac-
cording to the flesh. 3 For
though we walk in the flesh,
we do not wage war ac-
cording to the flesh. 4 For
the weapons of our warfare
are not of the flesh, but are
powerful in God for tear-
ing down strongholds. 5 We
tear down arguments and
every high thing that exalts
itself against the knowledge
of God, and we take every
thought captive to the obe-
dience of Christ. 6 We are
ready to punish any disobe-
dience, once your obedience
is complete.
7 Are you looking only at
outward appearances?
If
anyone is confident that he
belongs to Christ, he should
remind himself that just as
he belongs to Christ, so *we
also belong to Christ. 8 For
even if I boast somewhat
further about our authority
(which the Lord has given
†us for building you up and
not for tearing you down), I
will not be ashamed. 9 For

frighten you by my letters.
10 For, “His letters,” they say,
“are weighty and strong, but
his bodily presence is weak,
and his speech amounts to
nothing.” 11 The people who
say such things should re-
alize that what we say in
our letters when we are ab-
sent, we will demonstrate
by our actions when we are
present.
12 For we do not dare to
classify or compare our-
selves with some who com-
mend themselves.

however, will not boast
beyond certain limits, but
will confine our boasting to
the area of ministry that
God has assigned to us,
which reaches even as far
as you. 14 For we are not
overextending ourselves, as
though we did not reach
you; we were the first to
come all the way to you with
the gospel of Christ. 15 We
do not go beyond our limits
by boasting in the labors of
others.
On the contrary,
our hope is that, as your
faith increases, our area of
ministry among you will be
greatly expanded, 16 so that
we can preach the gospel
in the regions beyond you,
without boasting about work

Paul and the False Apos-
tles
1 If only you would bear
with me *for a bit in my
foolishness! Yes, do bear
with me! 2 I am jealous for
you with a godly jealousy,
because I promised you in
marriage to one husband, to
present you as a pure virgin
to Christ. 3 But I am afraid
that just as the serpent de-
ceived Eve by his crafti-
ness, †so your minds will

if someone comes to you
and preaches a different
message about Jesus than
the one we preached, or if
you receive a different spirit
than the one you received,
or a different gospel than
the one you accepted, you
bear with it well enough.
5 For I consider myself to be
in no way inferior to these
“super-apostles.” 6 I may be
untrained in speech, but I do
not lack knowledge; indeed,
in every way we have §been
made known to you in ev-
erything.

7 Did
I commit a sin by
humbling myself so that you
might be exalted, because
I preached the gospel of
God to you free of charge?
8 I “robbed” other churches
by receiving support from
them in order to serve you!
9 When I was with you
and in need, I did not bur-
den anyone, for the brothers
who came from Macedonia
supplied what I needed. I
kept myself from being a
burden to you in any way,
and I will continue to do so.
10 As surely as the truth of
Christ is in me, this boasting
of mine will not be *silenced
in the regions of Achaia.
11 Why? Because I do not
love you? God knows I do!
12 But what I am doing I
will continue to do, so that
I may deny any opportu-
nity to those who want to
be regarded as our equals
in what they boast about.
13 For such men are false
apostles and deceitful work-
ers, disguising themselves as
apostles of Christ. 14 And
no wonder, for even Satan
disguises himself as an an-
gel of light. 15 Therefore it
is no great surprise if his
servants also disguise them-
selves as servants of righ-
teousness. Their end will be
according to their works.

this confidence of boasting, I
am not saying in accordance
with the Lord, but as a fool.
18 Since many boast accord-
ing to the flesh, I too will
boast. 19 For you gladly bear
with fools since you are so
wise! 20 You bear with it
if anyone enslaves you, de-
vours you, takes advantage
of you, exalts himself, or
hits you in the face. 21 To
my shame I admit that we
were too weak for that! But
whatever anyone else dares
to boast about—I am speak-
ing like a fool—I also dare
to boast about. 22 Are they
Hebrews? So am I. Are they
Israelites? So am I. Are they
the offspring of Abraham?
So am I. 23 Are they servants
of Christ? (I am speaking
like I am out of my mind!)
I am even more so, with far
more labors, with †beatings
beyond measure, with far
more imprisonments, and
often facing death. 24 Five
times I received from the
Jews the forty lashes minus
one. 25 Three times I was
beaten with rods. Once I was
stoned. Three times I was
shipwrecked; a night and a
day I spent in the open sea.
26 I have often been on jour-
neys, exposed to dangers

from rivers, dangers from
robbers, dangers from my
own people, dangers from
the Gentiles, dangers in the
city, dangers in the wilder-
ness, dangers at sea, and
dangers among false broth-
ers. 27 I have endured labor
and hardship, many sleep-
less nights, and hunger and
thirst. I have often gone
without food and have been
cold due to a lack of suffi-
cient clothing. 28 Apart from
these external things, there
is ‡my daily burden: my
concern for all the churches.
29 Who is weak, and I am
not weak? Who is made to
stumble, and I do not burn
with indignation?
30 If I must boast, I will
boast about the things that
show my weakness. 31 The
God and Father of §the Lord
Jesus *Christ, who is blessed
forever, knows that I am not
lying. 32 In Damascus the
governor under King Are-
tas was guarding the city of
the †Damascenes, wanting to
arrest me, 33 but I was let
down in a basket through a
window in the city wall and
escaped from his hands.

Visions and Revelations
353
2 Corinthians 12:9
1 *Surely †it
is not bene-
ficial for me to boast, yet
I will go on to visions
and revelations from the
Lord. 2 I know a man in
Christ who fourteen years
ago was caught up to the
third heaven. (Whether it
was in the body or out of
the body I do not know; God
knows.) 3 And I know that
this man (whether in the
body or ‡out of the body I
do not know; God knows)
4 was caught up to Paradise
and heard words too sacred
to be spoken, which man
is not permitted to utter.
5 I will boast on behalf of
that man, but on my own
behalf I will not boast, ex-
cept about my weaknesses.
6 But even if I wanted to
boast, I would not be a fool,
for I would be speaking the
truth. Nevertheless, I refrain
so that no one will think
more of me than what he
sees in me or hears from
§me. 7 And to keep me from
becoming conceited because
of the surpassing greatness
of the revelations I received,
there was given to me a
thorn in the flesh, a messen-
ger of Satan to harass me
so that I would not become
conceited. 8 Three times I
pleaded with the Lord to
take it away from me. 9 But
he said to me, “My grace

Final Warnings and Greet-
ings
1 This is the third time I
am coming to you. Every
matter must be established
by the mouth of two or three
witnesses. 2 I gave a warn-
ing when I was present the
second time, and now I am
giving this *written warning
while absent: If I come again
I will not spare those who
sinned previously or any of
the others, 3 since you seek
proof that Christ is speaking
in me.
He is not weak
in dealing with you, but is
powerful among you. 4 For
†though he was crucified in
weakness, he lives by the
power of God.
Now we
also are weak in him, but
in dealing with you we will
live with him by the power
of God.
5 Examine yourselves to
see if you are in the faith;
test yourselves. Or do you
not realize that ‡Jesus Christ
is in you?—unless, of course,
you fail to meet the test.

nize that we have not failed
the test. 7 §I pray to God

own age among my people,
being far more zealous for
the traditions of my fathers.
15 But when *God, who set
me apart before I was born
and called me by his grace,
was pleased 16 to reveal his
Son in me so that I could
preach good news about him
among the Gentiles, I did
not immediately confer with

from him who called you

who are troubling you and
wish to pervert the gospel of
Christ. 8 But even if we or an
angel from heaven †should
preach to you a gospel con-
trary to the one we preached
to you, let him be accursed!

Damascus.
18 Then after three years
I went up to Jerusalem
to become acquainted with
†Peter, and I stayed with him
for fifteen days. 19 But I saw
none of the other apostles
except James, the brother of
the Lord. 20 (Now in what I
am writing to you, I assure
you before God that I am not
lying.) 21 Then I went into
the regions of Syria and Cili-
cia. 22 But I was personally
unknown to the churches
of Judea that are in Christ.
23 They were only hearing
people say, “The man who
once persecuted us is now
preaching the good news of
the faith he once tried to
destroy.” 24 So they were glo-
rifying God because of me.

those who were held in high

I was not running or had
not run in vain. 3 But not
even Titus, who was with
me, was compelled to be
circumcised, even though he
is a Greek. 4 Now this matter

arose because of the false
brothers who were secretly
brought in, who slipped in to
spy on the freedom we have
in Christ Jesus, so that they
might enslave us. 5 But we
did not yield to them in sub-
mission for even an hour, so
that the truth of the gospel
might be preserved for you.
6 Now from those who were
esteemed to be something
(what sort of men they once
were makes no difference
to me; God does not show
partiality)—those, I say, who
were held in high esteem
added nothing to me. 7 On
the contrary, they saw that I
had been entrusted with the
gospel to the uncircumcised,
just as Peter had been en-
trusted with the gospel to the
circumcised. 8 For he who
worked through Peter in his
apostleship to the circum-
cised also worked through
me in my apostleship to the

Gentiles.
Cephas, and John, who were
esteemed as pillars of the
church, recognized the grace
given to me, they gave the
right hand of fellowship to
Barnabas and me, agreeing
that we should go to the Gen-
tiles and that they should go
to the circumcised. 10 They
only asked us to remember
the poor, the very thing I
was eager to do.
Paul's Rebuke of Peter
when *Peter came
to Antioch, I opposed him
to his face, because he was
11 ButGalatians 2:12
358
blameworthy.
For he
regularly ate with the Gen-
tiles until certain men came
from James. But when they
came, he drew back and sep-
arated himself because he
was afraid of the circum-
cision faction. 13 And the
rest of the Jews acted hyp-
ocritically along with him,
so that even Barnabas was
led astray by their hypocrisy.
14 But when I saw that they
were not walking uprightly
in accordance with the truth
of the gospel, I said to †Peter
in front of them all, “If yoʋ,
though a Jew, live like a Gen-
tile and not like a Jew, ‡why
do yoʋ compel the Gentiles
to live like Jews?”
12
Galatians 3:6
I show myself to be a trans-
gressor. 19 For through the
law I died to the law so that
I might live for God. 20 I have
been crucified with Christ,
and it is no longer I who live,
but Christ who lives in me.
The life that I now live in the
flesh, I live by faith in the
Son of God, who loved me
and gave himself up for me.
21 I do not nullify the grace
of God, for if righteousness
comes through the law, then
Christ died for nothing.

Law or Faith
1 O foolish Galatians! Who
15 We §who are Jews by
nature and not Gentile sin-
ners 16 know that a person
is not justified by works of
the law but through faith in
*Jesus Christ. So we too have
put our faith in Christ Jesus
so that we may be justified
by faith in Christ and not by
works of the law, because
no flesh will be justified by
works of the law. 17 But
if we ourselves have also
been found to be sinners
while seeking to be justified
in Christ, is Christ then an
agent of sin? Certainly not!
18 For if I build up again the
very things that I tore down,has bewitched you *to keep
you from obeying the truth?
†In your presence, before
your very eyes, Jesus Christ
was publicly portrayed as
crucified. 2 Let me ask you
this one question: Did you
receive the Spirit by works
of the law or by hearing with
faith? 3 Are you so fool-
ish? Having begun by the
Spirit, are you now trying
to be perfected by the flesh?
4 Did you suffer so much
in vain?—if indeed it was
in vain. 5 Does God supply
you with the Spirit and work
miracles among you because
you perform the works of
the law or because you hear

with faith?

it was counted to him as

7 Therefore you must un-
derstand that those who
have faith are the sons
8 Now the
of Abraham.
Scripture, foreseeing that
God would justify the Gen-
tiles by faith, preached the
gospel beforehand to Abra-
ham, saying, “All the nations
will be blessed in yoʋ.” 9 So
then, those who have faith
are blessed along with Abra-
ham, the man of faith.
10 For all who rely on the
works of the law are un-
der a curse, because it is
written, “Cursed is everyone
who does not continue to
do everything written in the
Book of the Law.” 11 Now it
is evident that no one is jus-
tified before God by the law,
because “the righteous will
live by faith.” 12 But the law
is not based on faith; on the
contrary, “‡The person who
does these things will live by
them.” 13 Christ redeemed
us from the curse of the law
by becoming a curse for us,
for it is written, “Cursed is
everyone who hangs on a
tree.” 14 He redeemed us so
that the blessing of Abraham
would come to the Gentiles
in §Christ Jesus, so that we
could receive the promise of
the Spirit through faith.
The Law and the Promise
15 Brothers, let me give an
example from everyday life:
When a man-made covenant
is ratified, no one annuls
‡ 3:12 The person 92.6% ¦ He CT 6.6%

16 Now

the promises were spoken
to Abraham and to his de-
scendant.
Scripture does
not say, “And to his descen-
dants,” referring to many,
but referring to one man
it says, “And to yoʋr de-
scendant,” who is Christ.
17 My point is this: The law,
which came four hundred
and thirty years later, can-
not annul a covenant pre-
viously ratified by God *to
Christ, so as to invalidate the
promise. 18 For if the in-
heritance comes by the law,
it no longer comes by the
promise; but God granted it
to Abraham by a promise.
19 Why then was the law
given? It was added because
of transgressions, until the
descendant should come to
whom the promise had been
made.
It was ordained
through angels by the hand
20 Now a
of a mediator.
mediator does not represent
just one party, but God is
one.
Slaves and Sons
21 Is the law then opposed
to the promises of God? Cer-
tainly not! For if a law had
been given that was able to
give life, truly righteousness
would have come through
the law. 22 But the Scripture
has confined all under sin,
so that the promise might be
given on the basis of faith
in Jesus Christ to those who
believe.
§ 3:14 Christ Jesus ¦ Jesus Christ WHGalatians 3:23
360
23 Now before faith came,
we were kept in custody un-
der the law, confined until
the faith that was to come
would be revealed. 24 The
law, then, was our guardian
until Christ came, so that we
could be justified by faith.
25 But now that faith has
come, we are no longer un-
der a guardian, 26 for you are
all sons of God through faith
in Christ Jesus. 27 For all of
you who were baptized into
Christ have put on Christ.
28 There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither slave
nor free, there is neither
male nor female, for you are
all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And
if you belong to Christ, then
you are Abraham's descen-
dants and heirs according to
the promise.

And if yoʋ are a son, yoʋ are

Paul's Concern for the
Galatians
8 At that time, however,
when you did not know God,
you were enslaved to beings
that by nature are not gods.
9 But now that you have
come to know God, or rather
to be known by God, how
is it that you are turning
back again to the weak and
worthless elements? Do you
wish to be enslaved to them
once more? 10 You observe
days, months, seasons, and
years! 11 I am afraid for you,
lest somehow I have labored
for you in vain.
12 I plead with you, broth-
ers: Become as I am, be-
cause I also have become as
you are. You did me no
wrong. 13 But you know that
it was because of a physical
infirmity that I preached the
gospel to you the first time.
14 And you did not despise
or reject me even though
my physical condition was a
trial for ‡me. On the con-
trary, you received me as an
angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
15 §What then has become
of that sense of blessing you
had? For I testify to you
that, if possible, you would
I say that as long
as the heir is a child, he
differs in no way from a
slave, though he is the mas-
ter of all. 2 But he is un-
der guardians and stewards
until the time appointed by
his father. 3 In the same
way also, when we were
children, we were enslaved
to the elements of the world.
4 But when the fullness of
time came, God sent his Son,
born of a woman, born un-
der the law, 5 to redeem
those who were under the
law, so that we might receive

16 Have I now become your

in a good way, but rather
they wish to shut you out so
that you will be zealous for
them. 18 Now it is good to be
zealous for a good purpose,
and to be so at all times
and not just when I am with
you. 19 My *little children,

Galatians 5:1
§Jerusalem; she is in slavery
with her children. 26 But the
Jerusalem that is above is
the free woman; she is *the
mother of us all. 27 For it is
written,
“Rejoice, O barren woman,
who has never given
birth;
break forth and shout, yoʋ
who have never been
in labor!
For many are the children of
the desolate woman,
more than those of the
woman who has a
husband.”
28 Now †we,
brothers, like
Isaac, are children of the
promise. 29 But just as at that
time the child who was born
according to the flesh per-
secuted the child who was
born according to the Spirit,
so it is now also. 30 But
what does the Scripture say?
“Cast out the slave woman
and her son, for the son of
the slave woman shall not
inherit with the son of the
free woman.” 31 So, broth-
ers, we are not children of
the slave woman, but of the
free woman.
The Allegory of Hagar and
Sarah
21 Tell me, you who wish
to be under the law, do you
not listen to the law? 22 For
it is written that Abraham
had two sons, one by the
slave woman and one by
the free woman. 23 But the
son of the slave woman was
born according to the flesh,

woman was born through

2 Behold, I, Paul, say to you
that if you let yourselves be
circumcised, Christ will be
of no benefit to you. 3 I
testify again to every man
who lets himself be circum-
cised that he is obligated to
keep the entire law. 4 You
who are seeking to be jus-
tified by the law are alien-
ated from Christ; you have
fallen away from grace. 5 For
through the Spirit, by faith,
we eagerly await the hope
of righteousness. 6 For in
Christ Jesus neither does cir-
cumcision have any signif-
icance, nor uncircumcision,
but what matters is faith
working through love.
7 You were running well.
Who hindered you from
obeying the truth? 8 This
persuasion does not come
from him who calls you.
9 A little leaven leavens the
whole lump. 10 I have con-
fidence in you in the Lord
that you will adopt no other
mindset. But the one who is
troubling you will bear his
judgment, whoever he may
be. 11 Now, brothers, if I
am still preaching circumci-
sion, why am I still being
persecuted? In that case the
offense of the cross has been
done away with. 12 Oh that
those who are unsettling you
would cut themselves off!
13 You were called to free-
dom, brothers. Only do not
† 5:19 adultery, ¦ — CT

use your freedom as an op-
portunity for the flesh, but
serve one another in love.
14 For the entire law is ful-
filled in this one command-
ment: “Yoʋ shall love yoʋr
neighbor as yoʋrself.” 15 But
if you bite and devour one
another, watch out, or you
will be consumed by one
another.
The Fruit of the Spirit and
the Works of the Flesh
16 I say then, walk by the
Spirit and you will certainly
not gratify the desires of the
flesh. 17 For the flesh de-
sires what is contrary to the
Spirit, and the Spirit desires
what is contrary to the flesh.
These are opposed to each
other, to keep you from do-
ing the very things you want
18 But if you are

led by the Spirit, you are
not under the law. 19 Now
the works of the flesh are
obvious: †adultery, forni-
cation, impurity, sensuality,
20 idolatry, sorcery, hostil-
ities, ‡quarrels, §jealousies,
fits of rage, selfish ambi-
tions, dissensions, factions,
21 envy, *murder, drunken-
ness, revelries, and the like.
I warn you, just as I warned
you before, that those who
practice such things will not
inherit the kingdom of God.
22 But the fruit of the Spirit
is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithful-
ness, 23 gentleness, and self-

control; against such things
there is no law. 24 Now those
who belong to †Christ have
crucified the flesh with its
passions and desires.
25 Since we live by the
Spirit, let us also keep in step
with the Spirit. 26 Let us not
become conceited, provok-
ing one another and envying
one another.

the flesh, but he who sows
to the Spirit will reap eternal
life from the Spirit. 9 So let
us not grow weary in doing
good, for in due time we
will reap, if we do not give
up. 10 Therefore, as we have
opportunity, let us do good
to all, and especially to those
of the household of faith.

which he purposed in Christ
10 as a plan for the fullness
of times, to bring everything
together in Christ, things in
heaven and things on earth.
11 In Christ we have obtained
an inheritance, having been
foreordained according to
the purpose of him who ac-
complishes all things accord-
ing to the counsel of his own
will, 12 so that we who were
the first to hope in Christ,
might live for the praise of
his glory. 13 ‡And when you

above every ruler and au-
thority, power and domin-

is named, not only in this
age but also in the age to
come. 22 God put all things

feet and appointed him as

God, who is rich in mercy,
because of the great love

5 made us alive together with
Christ even when we were
dead in our trespasses—by
grace you have been saved.
6 And God raised us up with

the ages to come he might

prepared beforehand so that
we would walk in them.

Therefore remember
that *you, once Gentiles in

those who call themselves
“the circumcision,” which
is made in the flesh by
hands— 12 remember that
you were apart from Christ

once far away have been
brought near by the blood
of Christ. 14 For he is our
peace, who has united both
the Jews and Gentiles into

down the wall of hostility
that divided us. 15 He did
this by abolishing the law
with its commandments
and ordinances in order to
make peace between the two
groups and create in himself

reconciled both groups to

him we both have access

Ephesians 3:9
Paul's Ministry to the Gen-
tiles
1 For this reason I, Paul, a
prisoner for Christ Jesus for
the sake of you Gentiles, bow
my knees in prayer. 2 Surely
you have heard of the stew-
ardship of God's grace that
was given to me for *you,
3 how God made the mystery
known to me by revelation,
just as I have written above
in a few words. 4 When
you read what I have writ-
ten, you can understand my
insight into the mystery of
Christ, 5 which in previous
generations was not made
known to the sons of men as
it has now been revealed by
the Spirit to his holy apostles
and prophets. 6 This mystery
is that the Gentiles are fellow
heirs, fellow members of the
body, and fellow partakers
of †God's promise in ‡Christ
through the gospel. 7 I be-
came a servant of this gospel
according to the gift of God's
grace that was given to me
by the working of his power.
8 This grace was given to
me, the very least of all
the saints, to preach §among
the Gentiles the good news
of the boundless riches of
Christ, 9 and to bring to light
*for everyone the †plan of

pose of bringing this to light
is that, through the church,
the manifold wisdom of God
might now be made known
to the rulers and the author-
ities in the heavenly realms,
11 according to the eternal
purpose that God has car-
ried out in Christ Jesus our
Lord. 12 Because of Christ
and our faith in him, we
have boldness and confident
access to God. 13 Therefore
I ask you not to lose heart
at my tribulations on your
behalf, which will bring you
glory.
Prayer for the Ephesians
to Know the Love of Christ
14 For this reason I bow
my knees in prayer before
the Father §of our Lord Jesus
Christ, 15 from whom every
family in heaven and on
earth is named. 16 I pray
that, according to the riches
of his glory, he would grant
you to be strengthened with
power through his Spirit in
your inner being, 17 so that
Christ may dwell in your
hearts through faith, 18 as
you are being rooted and
grounded in love. I pray
that you may be able to fully
comprehend, together with
all the saints, how wide and
long and *deep and high
19 is the love of Christ, and
368
Ephesians 4:8
to know this love that sur-
passes knowledge, so that
you may be filled with all the
fullness of God.
20 Now to him who is
able to do immeasurably
more than all we could ask
or imagine, according to
the power at work within
us— 21 to him be glory in
the church †in Christ Jesus
throughout all generations,
forever and ever. Amen.

Unity in the Body of Christ
I, a prisoner
for the Lord, urge you to
walk in a manner worthy
of the calling you have re-
ceived, 2 with all humility
and gentleness, and with pa-
tience, bearing with one an-
other in love, 3 and being
diligent to keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of
peace. 4 There is one body
and one Spirit (just as you
were called to one hope at
your calling), 5 one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, 6 one God
and Father of all, who is over
all and through all and in *us
all.
7 Now each one of us
was given grace according to
the measure of Christ's gift.
8 Therefore it says,

what does “he as-
cended” mean except that
he †first also descended into
the lower parts of the earth?
10 He who descended is the
very one who ascended far
above all the heavens, so
that he might fill all things.)
11 It was he who appointed
some to be apostles, some
to be prophets, some to be
evangelists, and some to be
pastors and teachers, 12 to
equip the saints for the work
of ministry and to build up
the body of Christ, 13 until we
all reach unity in the faith
and in the knowledge of the
Son of God, growing into
maturity with a stature mea-
sured by Christ's fullness.
14 So we must no longer
be infants, tossed back and
forth by waves and carried
about by every wind of doc-
trine, by the trickery of men
and their craftiness in de-
ceitful scheming. 15 Rather,
speaking the truth in love,
we must grow up in every
way into him who is the

in every kind of impurity.

Christ in that way! 21 Surely
you have heard about him
and were taught in him, just
as the truth is in Jesus, 22 to
put off your old self, which
belongs to your former way
of life and is being corrupted
by its deceitful desires, 23 to

your minds, 24 and to put on

you all 5 because of your
partnership with me in the
gospel from the first day un-

that he who began a good

day of †Christ Jesus. 7 It is
right for me to think this
way about you all, since I
have you in my heart. For
you all share with me in
God's grace, both in my im-
prisonment and in my de-
fense and confirmation of
the gospel. 8 For God is my
witness that I long for you all

consider equality with God

ing the form of a servant

found in appearance as a
man, he humbled himself

Shining as Lights in the
World
12 Therefore, my beloved
friends, just as you have
always obeyed, not only in
my presence, but now much
more in my absence, work
out your own salvation with
fear and trembling, 13 for
God is the one at work in
you, granting you the will
and power to do so, accord-
ing to his good pleasure.
14 Do everything without
grumbling or arguing, 15 so
that you may be blameless
and pure, children of God
without blemish in the midst
of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom
you shine as lights in the
world 16 as you hold firmly
to the word of life. Then I
will have a reason to boast

in the day of Christ that I
did not run or labor in vain.
17 But even if I am being
poured out as a drink offer-
ing upon the sacrifice and
service of your faith, I am
glad and rejoice with you all.
18 In the same way you also
should be glad and rejoice
with me.
tus
Timothy and Epaphrodi-
19 I hope in the Lord Jesus
to send Timothy to you soon
so that I too may be encour-
aged when I receive news
about you. 20 I have no one
else like-minded who will be
genuinely concerned about
your welfare. 21 For they all
seek their own interests, not
those of †Christ Jesus. 22 But
you know Timothy's proven
character, how as a son with
a father he has served with
me in the work of the gospel.
23 Therefore I hope to send
him to you at once, as soon
as I find out what is going to
happen to me. 24 And I am
confident in the Lord that I
myself will also come soon.
25 But for now I thought
it necessary to send back
to you Epaphroditus—my
brother, fellow worker, and
fellow soldier, who is also
your messenger and minis-
ter to my need. 26 For he
has been longing ‡for you all
and was distressed because
you heard that he was sick.
27 Indeed he was sick, al-
most to the point of death.
But God had mercy on him,
† 2:21 Christ Jesus ¦ Jesus Christ NA SBL TH
‡ 2:26 for ¦ to see WHPhilippians 2:28

and not only on him but
also on me, so that I would
not have one sorrow after
another. 28 Therefore I am
all the more eager to send
him, so that when you see
him again you can rejoice
and I can be less anxious.
29 So receive him in the Lord
with all joy, and honor men
like him, 30 because he drew
near to death for the work
of §Christ, *disregarding his
own life to complete what
was lacking in your service
to me.

law, blameless. 7 But what-
ever was gain to me I have
counted as loss for the sake
of Christ. 8 More than that,
I count all things as loss
because of the surpassing
value of knowing Christ Je-
sus my Lord. For his sake
I have suffered the loss of
all things and count them as
rubbish so that I may gain
Christ 9 and be found in him,
not having a righteousness
of my own that comes from
the law, but the righteous-
ness that is through faith
in Christ, which comes from
God on the basis of faith. 10 I
want to know Christ and the
power of his resurrection
and the fellowship of his suf-
ferings, becoming like him
in his death, 11 in the hope
of attaining the resurrection
from the dead.

17 Join together in imitat-
ing me, brothers, and pay
close attention to those who
walk according to the exam-
ple you have in us. 18 For
I have often told you, and
tell you now with tears, that
many walk as enemies of the
cross of Christ. 19 Their end
is destruction, their god is
their belly, and their glory
is in their shame.
Their
minds are set on earthly
things. 20 But our citizen-
ship is in heaven, and we
eagerly await from there a
Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
21 who will transform our
lowly bodies to be like his
glorious body, by the power
that enables him to subject
all things to himself.

1 Therefore,
my brothers,
whom I love and long for,
my joy and crown, stand
firm in the Lord in this way,
my beloved friends.

gospel at my side, along
with Clement and the rest
of my fellow workers, whose
names are in the book of life.
4 Rejoice in the Lord al-
ways, and again I say, re-
joice! 5 Let your gentleness
be known to everyone. The
Lord is near. 6 Be anxious
about nothing, but in every-
thing, by prayer and sup-
plication, with thanksgiving,
make your requests known
to God. 7 And the peace of
God that surpasses all un-
derstanding will guard your
hearts and minds in Christ
Jesus.
8 Finally, brothers, what-
ever is true, whatever is
honorable,
whatever is
right, whatever is pure,
whatever is lovely, whatever
is commendable, if anything
is virtuous or praiseworthy,
think about such things.
9 Practice what you have
learned and received from
me, and what you have
heard and seen in me. And
the God of peace will be with
you.
Acknowledgment of the
Philippians' Gift
10 I have great joy in the
Lord that now at last you
have revived your concern
for me. Indeed, you were
concerned but had no oppor-
tunity to show it. 11 Not that
I am speaking about being
in need, for I have learned
to be content in whatever
circumstances I find myself.

14 Nevertheless, you did well
by sharing with me in my
affliction.
15 As
you Philippians
know, in the early days
of the gospel, when I set
out from Macedonia, no
church partnered with me
in the matter of giving and
receiving except you alone.
16 Even when I was in
Thessalonica, you sent me
help for my needs more than
once. 17 Not that I seek the
gift, but I seek the fruit that
abounds to your account. 18 I
have received everything in
full and have an abundance.
I am amply supplied, now
that I have received from
Epaphroditus the gifts you
sent. They are an aroma
of a sweet fragrance, an
acceptable sacrifice, pleas-
ing to God. 19 And my God
will fully supply your every
need through Christ Jesus
according to his riches in
glory. 20 Glory be to our God
and Father forever and ever!
Amen.

PAUL TO THE
COLOSSIANS
Greeting
1 Paul, an apostle of *Jesus

of God, and Timothy our
brother, 2 to the saints and
faithful brothers in Christ
who are in Colossae: Grace
to you and peace from God

‡the God and Father of our

Epaphras, our beloved fel-
low servant, who is a faithful
minister of Christ on †your
behalf 8 and who also told us
about your love in the Spirit.
The Preeminence of Christ
9 For this reason, from the
day we heard this, we have
not ceased praying for you
and asking that you may
be filled with the knowledge
of God's will in all wisdom
and spiritual understanding,
10 so that you may walk
in a manner worthy of the
Lord with every desire to
please him: bearing fruit
in every good work and in-
creasing in the knowledge
of God; 11 being strength-
ened with all power, accord-
ing to his glorious might, so
that you may have great en-
durance and patience with
joy; 12 giving thanks to ‡the
Father, who has enabled
§us to share in the in-
heritance of the saints in
light. 13 He has rescued us
from the dominion of dark-
ness and transferred us into
the kingdom of his beloved
Son, 14 in whom we have
*redemption, the remission
of sins. 15 He is the im-
age of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation.
16 For by him all things
were created, in heaven and
Lord Jesus Christ when we
pray for you, 4 because we
have heard of your faith in
Christ Jesus and §your love
for all the saints, 5 the faith
and love that spring from
the hope that is laid up for
you in heaven. You have al-
ready heard about this hope
in the message of the truth
of the gospel 6 that has come
to you. This gospel has gone
out into all the world, where
it is bearing fruit *and in-
creasing, just as it has been
doing among you since the
day you heard it and under-
stood the grace of God in
truth. 7 You learned it from

on earth, visible and invisi-
ble, whether thrones or do-
minions, rulers or authori-
ties—all things were created
through him and for him.
17 He is before all things,
and in him all things hold
together. 18 He is the head of
the body, the church. He is
the beginning, the firstborn
from the dead, so that in
everything he may be pre-
eminent. 19 For in him all the
fullness of God was pleased
to dwell, 20 and through him
to reconcile all things to
himself, whether on earth
or in heaven, making peace
through the blood of his
cross.
21 At one time you were
alienated from God and hos-
tile in your minds because
of your evil works.
But
now †God has reconciled
you to himself 22 through
the death of Christ in his
physical body, ‡in order to
bring you into his own pres-
ence as holy, unblemished,
and above reproach, 23 if
indeed you continue in the
faith, grounded and stead-
fast, without shifting away
from the hope of the gospel
that you heard. This gospel
has been preached in all
creation under heaven, and
of this gospel I, Paul, have
become a servant.

24 I rejoice now in my suf-
ferings for you, and in my
flesh I am filling up what is
lacking in Christ's afflictions
for the sake of his body, that
is, the church. 25 I became
a servant of the church ac-
cording to the stewardship
from God that was given to
me for you, to make the
word of God fully known,
26 the mystery that has been
hidden for ages and gen-
erations but has now been
revealed to his saints. 27 To
them God resolved to make
known how great among
the Gentiles are the glorious
riches of this mystery, which
is Christ in you, the hope
of glory. 28 He is the one
we proclaim, admonishing
everyone and teaching ev-
eryone with all wisdom, so
that we may present every-
one mature in Christ §Jesus.
29 To this end I labor, striving
according to his energy that
is powerfully at work within
me.

they may know the mystery

treasures of wisdom and

say this so that no one will
deceive you with persuasive
speech. 5 For though I am
absent in body, I am with
you in spirit, rejoicing to
see your good order and
the firmness of your faith
in Christ.
Fullness of Life in Christ
6 Therefore, just as you re-
ceived Christ Jesus the Lord,
continue to walk in him,
7 being rooted and built up
in him and established in
the faith, just as you were
taught, abounding †in it with
thanksgiving.
8 Be careful that no one
takes you captive through
philosophy and empty de-
ceit, according to the tra-
dition of men and the ele-
ments of the world, and not
according to Christ. 9 For

ture dwells bodily in Christ,

12 Having been buried with
him in baptism, you have

also been raised with him
through faith in the pow-
erful working of God, who
raised him from the dead.
13 And §although you were
dead in your trespasses and
the uncircumcision of your
flesh, God made you alive
together with Christ. He for-
gave *us all our trespasses
14 by blotting out the cer-
tificate of debt that stood
against us with its legal de-
mands; he took it away by
nailing it to the cross. 15 He
stripped the rulers and au-
thorities of their power and
made a public display of
them, leading a triumphal
procession over them by the
cross.
16 Therefore let no one
judge you in regard to food
†or drink, or in the matter
of a feast, a New Moon cel-
ebration, or a Sabbath day.
17 These are a shadow of the
things to come, but the sub-
stance is Christ. 18 Let no one
who delights in false humil-
ity and angelic religion dis-
qualify you. Such a person
takes his stand on things he
has ‡not seen, being puffed
up without reason by the
mind of his flesh, 19 while
not holding fast to the head,
from whom the entire body,
being supported and knit to-
gether by its joints and ten-
dons, grows with a growth
that is from God.

too once walked in these
ways when you lived among
them. 8 But now you must
put them all aside: wrath,
anger, malice, slander, and
filthy language from your
mouth. 9 Do not lie to one an-
other, since you have put off
the old self with its practices
10 and have put on the new
self, which is being renewed
in knowledge according to
the image of its Creator.
11 Here there is no distinc-
tion between Greek and Jew,
circumcised and uncircum-
cised, barbarian, Scythian,
slave and free, but Christ is
all and in all.
12 Therefore,
as God's
chosen people, holy and
beloved, put on tender-
hearted mercy, kindness,
humility, gentleness, and
patience, 13 bearing with
one another and forgiving
one other if any one of
you has a complaint against
another; just as ‡Christ
forgave you, so you also
must forgive. 14 Above all,
put on love, which is the
bond of perfection. 15 Let
the peace of §God rule
in your hearts, since as
members of one body you
were called to peace. And
be thankful. 16 Let the word

one another with all wisdom

also will be revealed with
him in glory.

you, brothers, became imita-

in Christ Jesus that are in
Judea, because you suffered
the same things from your
own countrymen that they
did from the Jews, 15 who
killed the Lord Jesus and
†their own prophets, and
who also drove ‡us out. They
displease God and are hos-
tile to all men 16 by hin-
dering us from telling the
Gentiles how they can be
saved. In this way they are
always filling up the mea-

has come upon them at last.

17 As for us, brothers,

is an avenger in all these
things, as we told you before
and solemnly warned you.
7 For God did not call us to
be impure, but to live in ho-
liness. 8 Therefore whoever
rejects this command does
not reject man but God, who
†has given his Holy Spirit to

9 Now concerning broth-
erly love, you have no need
for anyone to write to you,
for you yourselves have
been taught by God to love
one another. 10 And indeed
you do love all the brothers
throughout Macedonia. But
we urge you, brothers, to do
so more and more. 11 We
urge you to aspire to lead a
quiet life, to attend to your
own affairs, and to work
with your §own hands, just
as we commanded you, 12 so
that you may walk properly
toward outsiders and not be
in need of anything.
1 Thessalonians 5:5
the Lord, we declare to you
that we who are alive, who
are left behind until the com-
ing of the Lord, will cer-
tainly not precede those who
have fallen asleep. 16 For
the Lord himself will de-
scend from heaven with a
commanding shout, with the
voice of an archangel, and
with the trumpet call of God,
and the dead in Christ will
rise first. 17 Then we who are
alive, who are left behind,
will be caught up together
with them in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air.
And so we will always be
with the Lord. 18 Therefore
encourage one another with
these words.

The Day of the Lord
Now concerning the
times and seasons, brothers,
you have no need for
anything to be written to
you. 2 For you yourselves
know very well that the day
of the Lord will come like a

Final Instructions and
Benediction

ers, to recognize those who
labor among you, who lead
you in the Lord and admon-
ish you, 13 and to regard
them very highly in love
because of their work. Be
at peace with one another.

ers, to admonish those who
are idle, encourage the faint-
hearted, support the weak,
and be patient toward all.

THE SECOND
LETTER OF PAUL
TO THE
THESSALONIANS
Greeting
1 Paul, Silvanus, and Tim-
othy, to the church of the
Thessalonians in God our
Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ: 2 Grace to you and
peace from God *our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 2:2
revelation of the Lord Jesus
from heaven with his mighty
angels. 8 With flaming fire
he will inflict vengeance on
those who do not know God
and who do not obey the
gospel of our Lord †Jesus.
9 They will suffer the punish-
ment of eternal destruction,
separated from the presence
of the Lord and from the
glory of his might, 10 on that
day when he comes to be glo-
rified by his saints and to be
marveled at by all who ‡have
believed, including you, be-
cause you have believed our
testimony. 11 With this in
mind, we always pray for
you that our God will make
you worthy of his calling and
by his power bring to fulfill-
ment every good intention
and work of faith, 12 so that
the name of our Lord §Jesus
will be glorified in you, and
you in him, according to the
grace of our God and Lord,
Jesus Christ.
The Judgment at Christ's
Coming
3 We ought always to give
thanks to God for you, broth-
ers, as is only fitting, because
your faith is greatly increas-
ing and the love that each
of you has for one another
is abounding. 4 As a result
we ourselves boast about
you in the churches of God
for your perseverance and
faithfulness in all the perse-
cutions and tribulations that
you are enduring. 5 This

the day of †Christ has al-
ready come. 3 Let no one de-
ceive you in any manner, for
that day cannot come unless
the apostasy comes first and
the man of ‡sin is revealed,
the son of destruction. 4 He
will oppose and exalt him-
self above every so-called
god and object of worship, so
that he sits §as God in the
temple of God, proclaiming
himself to be God. 5 Do you
not remember that I told you
these things when I was still
with you? 6 And you know
what is now restraining him
so that he will be revealed in
his *own time. 7 For the mys-
tery of lawlessness is already
at work, but the one who
now restrains will do so until
he is taken out of the way.
8 And then the lawless one
will be revealed, whom the
Lord †will destroy with the
breath of his mouth and an-
nihilate by the appearance
of his coming. 9 The coming
of the lawless one will be in
accordance with the work-
ing of Satan, with all kinds of
counterfeit miracles, signs,
and wonders, 10 and with ev-
ery kind of wicked deception
‡among those who are per-
ishing, because they refused
to love the truth and so be
saved. 11 For this reason God
§will send them a powerful
delusion, leading them to be-
lieve what is false, 12 so that
2 Thessalonians 3:3
all who have not believed
the truth but have taken
pleasure in unrighteousness
will be condemned.
Chosen for Salvation
13 But we must always give
thanks to God for you, broth-
ers beloved by the Lord, be-
cause God chose you *from
the beginning for salvation
through sanctification by the
Spirit and belief in the truth.
14 He called you to this
through our gospel, so that
you might obtain the glory of
our Lord Jesus Christ. 15 So
then, brothers, stand firm
and hold fast to the teach-
ings that were passed on to
you, whether by word of
mouth or by a letter from us.
16 Now may our Lord Jesus
Christ himself and God our
Father, who has loved us
and given us eternal comfort
and good hope by his grace,
17 comfort †your hearts and
establish you in every good
‡word and work.

Pray for Us
1 Finally, brothers, pray for
us, that the word of the Lord
may spread rapidly and be
glorified, just as it was with
you. 2 And pray that we may
be rescued from deviant and
evil men, for not all have
faith. 3 But the Lord is faith-
ful; he will establish you and

Warning Against Idleness
6 Now we command you,
2 Thessalonians 3:18
Christ to work quietly and
eat their own bread. 13 But
as for you, brothers, do not
grow weary in doing good.
14 If anyone does not obey
what we say in this letter,
take note of him and do not
associate with him, so that
he will feel ashamed. 15 Yet
do not regard him as an
enemy, but admonish him as
a brother.
Benediction
16 Now may the Lord of
peace himself give you peace
at all times and in every way.
The Lord be with you all.
17 I, Paul, write this greet-
ing with my own hand. This

Lord Jesus Christ, to keep

the teaching we passed on

selves know how you ought
to imitate us, because we
were not idle when we were
with you, 8 nor did we eat
bread from anyone free of
charge.
On the contrary,
with labor and hardship we
worked day and night so
as not to be a burden to
any of you. 9 We did this,
not because we do not have
the right to be supported,
but to present ourselves as
an example for you to imi-
tate. 10 For even when we
were with you, we gave you
this command: “If anyone
is not willing to work, nei-
ther should he eat.” 11 For
we hear that some among
you are walking in idleness,

testimony I was appointed to
be a preacher, an apostle,
and a teacher of the Gentiles
in faith and truth. (I am
speaking the truth †in Christ;
I am not lying.)
8 Therefore I want the men
in every place to pray, lifting
up holy hands without anger
or ‡argument. 9 Likewise, I
want the women to adorn
themselves in respectable
apparel, with modesty and
discretion, not with elabo-
rately braided §hair, gold,
pearls, or expensive cloth-
ing, 10 but with good works,
which is proper for women
who profess godly rever-
ence. 11 A woman should
learn quietly with full sub-
mission. 12 I do not per-
mit a woman to teach or
to have authority over a
man; rather, she is to re-
main quiet. 13 For Adam
was formed first, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not the one
who was deceived; it was the
woman who was deceived
and fell into transgression.
15 Nevertheless, women will
be saved through childbear-
ing, if they continue in faith,
love, and holiness, with self-
control.
Instruction About Prayer
first of all,
that supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and thanks-
givings be made for all peo-
ple, 2 for kings and all who
are in authority, so that we
may lead a quiet and peace-
ful life in all godliness and
dignity. 3 *For this is good
and acceptable before God

people to be saved and to
come to the knowledge of

able to teach, 3 not given
to wine, not violent, *not
greedy for sordid gain, but
gentle, not contentious, and
not a lover of money. 4 He
must lead his own house-
hold well, keeping his chil-
dren in submission with all
dignity. 5 (For if a man does
not know how to lead his
own household, how will he
take care of God's church?)
6 He must not be a new
convert, or he might become
puffed up and fall into the
condemnation of the devil.
7 He must also have a good
reputation among outsiders,
so that he may not fall into
the reproach and snare of
the devil.
Qualifications for Dea-
cons
8 Deacons likewise must
be dignified, not double-
tongued, not given to much
wine, and not greedy for sor-
did gain. 9 They must hold
the mystery of the faith with
a clear conscience. 10 They
must first be tested; if they
are above reproach, let them
serve as deacons. 11 Their
wives likewise must be dig-
nified, not slanderers, but
sober-minded and faithful
in all things. 12 A deacon
must be the husband of one
wife and must lead his chil-
dren and his own house-

have served well as deacons

and taken up in glory.

Some Will Fall Away from
the Faith
1 Now the Spirit expressly
says that in latter times
some will fall away from
the faith and occupy them-
selves with deceitful spir-
its and the teachings of
demons, 2 being influenced
by the hypocrisy of liars
who are seared in their own
consciences. 3 They forbid
marriage and demand absti-
nence from foods that God
created to be received with
thanksgiving by those who
believe and know the truth.

God is good, and nothing
is to be rejected when it
is received with thanksgiv-
ing, 5 since it is sanctified
through the word of God and
prayer.
A Good Servant of Jesus
Christ
6 If yoʋ point these things
out to the brothers, yoʋ
will be a good servant of
*Jesus Christ,
nourished
by the words of the faith
and the sound doctrine that
yoʋ have closely followed.
7 Have nothing to do with
profane myths and old
wives' tales. Rather train
yoʋrself for godliness. 8 For
bodily training is beneficial
to a certain extent, but
godliness is beneficial in
every way, since it holds
†promise
for both the
present life and the life
to come. 9 This saying is
trustworthy and deserving
of full acceptance. 10 For this
is why we labor and ‡suffer

put our hope in the living
God, who is the Savior of
all people, and especially of
those who believe.

in self-indulgence is dead
even while she lives. 7 Give
these commands as well, so
that no one will be open
to blame. 8 But if anyone
does not provide for his own
relatives, and especially for
those of his own household,
he has denied the faith and
is worse than an unbeliever.
9 A widow may be put on
the list to receive support
if she is at least sixty years
old, has been the wife of
one husband, 10 and has a
reputation for good works,
that is, if she has brought

ity, washed the feet of the
saints, helped the afflicted,

younger widows, for when
their sensual desires draw
them away from Christ, they
wish to marry, 12 thus bring-
ing judgment on themselves
because they have broken
their previous pledge. 13 At
the same time, they learn
to be idle, wandering about
from house to house. And
they are not only idle, but
also gossips and busybodies,
saying things they should
not say. 14 So I advise the
younger widows to marry,
bear children, and man-
age their households, so
as to give the adversary
no opportunity to revile us.
15 For some have already
turned away to follow Satan.
1 Timothy 5:25
16 If any believing †man or
woman has relatives who
are widows, they must help
them; the church should not
be burdened, so that it may
help those who are truly
widows.
17 Elders who lead well
should be considered wor-
thy of double honor, es-
pecially those who labor
in preaching and teaching.
18 For the Scripture says,
“Yoʋ shall not muzzle an ox
while it is threshing,” and,
“The worker is worthy of
his wages.” 19 Do not accept
an accusation against an el-
der unless it is confirmed
by two or three witnesses.
20 As for those who sin, re-
prove them in the presence
of all, so that the rest may
stand in fear. 21 I solemnly
charge yoʋ before God and
‡the Lord Jesus Christ and
the chosen angels to observe
these things without partial-
ity, doing nothing out of fa-
voritism. 22 Do not lay hands
on anyone hastily, and do
not take part in the sins of
others; keep yoʋrself pure.
23 (No longer drink only wa-
ter, but use a little wine for
the sake of yoʋr stomach
and yoʋr frequent illnesses.)
24 The sins of some are ob-
vious, going before them to
judgment, but the sins of
others trail along behind.
25 In the same way, good
works are obvious, and even
those that are not obvious
cannot remain hidden.

This
grace was given to us in
Christ Jesus before time be-
gan, 10 but has now been
revealed through the ap-

gospel. 11 For this gospel
I was appointed to be a
preacher, an apostle, and
a teacher ‡of the Gentiles.

fering these things. But I

Paul's Appeal for Ones-

8 Therefore, although I am
bold enough in Christ to
command yoʋ to do what is
right, 9 I would rather appeal
to yoʋ on the basis of love.
I, Paul, an old man and now
a prisoner for †Jesus Christ,
10 appeal to yoʋ on behalf of
my child, Onesimus, whose
father I have become during
my imprisonment. 11 Once
he was useless to yoʋ, but
now he is useful both to yoʋ
and to me. I am sending him
‡back, 12 §and I ask yoʋ to
receive him, that is, my very
own heart. 13 I wanted to
keep him with me so that he
could serve me in yoʋr place
during my imprisonment for
the gospel. 14 But I did not
want to do anything with-
out yoʋr consent, so that
yoʋr good deed might not
be done out of compulsion,
but of yoʋr own free will.
15 Perhaps the reason he was
separated from yoʋ for an
hour was so that yoʋ might
have him back forever, 16 no
longer as a slave, but more
than a slave, as a beloved
brother, especially to me,
but even more so to yoʋ,
both in the flesh and in the
Lord.
17 So if yoʋ consider me
to be a partner, receive him
always making mention of
yoʋ in my prayers, 5 because
I hear of yoʋr love for all
the saints and the faith that
yoʋ have toward the Lord
Jesus. 6 I pray that yoʋr fel-

HEBREWS
God Has Spoken Through
His Son
1 God spoke to our fathers
long ago at many times and
in many ways through the
prophets, but in these last
days he has spoken to us
through his Son, 2 whom he
appointed heir of all things,
and through whom he made
the universe. 3 He is the ra-
diance of God's glory and the
exact representation of his
nature, sustaining all things
by his powerful word. When
he had made purification for
*our sins †by giving his own
life, he sat down at the right
hand of the Majesty in high
places, 4 having become as
much superior to the angels
as the name he has inherited
is more excellent than theirs.
The Son Is Superior to
Angels
5 For to which of the angels
did God ever say,
“Yoʋ are my Son;
today I have begotten yoʋ”?
Or again,
his firstborn into the world,
he says,
“Let all the angels of God
worship him.”
7 Of the angels he says,
“He makes his angels winds,
and his servants a flame of
fire,”
8 but of the Son he says,
“Yoʋr throne, O God, en-
dures forever and
ever;
the scepter ‡of §yoʋr king-
dom is a scepter of
uprightness.
9 Yoʋ have loved righteous-
ness and hated law-
lessness;
therefore God, yoʋr God, has
anointed yoʋ
with the oil of gladness
beyond yoʋr compan-
ions.”
10 And,
“In the beginning yoʋ, O
Lord, laid the founda-
tion of the earth,
and the heavens are the
works of yoʋr hands.
11 They will perish, but yoʋ
remain;
they will all wear out like a
garment.

13 To which of the angels did
God ever say,
“Sit at my right hand
until I make yoʋr enemies
a footstool for yoʋr
feet”?
14 Are they not all minister-
ing spirits sent out to serve
those who will inherit salva-
tion?

Warning Against Neglect-
ing Salvation
1 Therefore we must pay
greater attention to what we
have heard, so that we do
2 For if
not drift away.
the message spoken through
angels was valid and every
transgression and disobedi-
ence received a just retri-
bution, 3 how will we es-
cape if we neglect so great
a salvation? This salvation
was first announced by the
Lord, and it was confirmed
to us by those who heard
him. 4 God also bore further
witness with signs, wonders,
various miracles, and gifts
of the Holy Spirit distributed
according to his will.
THE LETTER TO THE HEBREWS 2:11
Jesus the Author of Salva-
tion
5 For it was not to angels
that God subjected the world
to come, about which we are
speaking. 6 But in one place
someone has testified:
“What is man that yoʋ are
mindful of him,
or the son of man that yoʋ
care for him?
7 Yoʋ made him a little lower
than the angels
and crowned him with glory
and *honor;
8 yoʋ put everything in
subjection under his
feet.”
In subjecting everything †to
him, God left nothing that
is not subjected to him.
But now we do not yet
see everything subjected to
him. 9 But we do see Jesus,
who for a little while was
made lower than the angels,
now crowned with glory and
honor because he suffered
death, so that ‡by the grace
of God he might taste death
for everyone.
10 For in bringing many
sons to glory, it was fit-
ting that God, for whom
and through whom all things
exist, should make the au-
thor of their salvation per-
fect through suffering. 11 For
he who sanctifies and those
who are being sanctified all
have one Father. That is why

Jesus Is Superior to Moses
Therefore, holy broth-
ers, you who share in a
heavenly calling, consider
*Jesus Christ, the apostle and
high priest of our confes-
sion, 2 who was faithful to
the one who appointed him,
just as Moses was faithful
in †all God's house. 3 Yet
Jesus is considered worthy
of more glory than Moses,
just as the builder of a house

house is built by someone,
but the builder of all things
is God. 5 Now Moses was
faithful in all God's house as
a servant, which provided
testimony to what would be
spoken later. 6 But Christ
is faithful over God's house
as a Son. And we are ‡his
house if §indeed we hold
*our confidence firm to the
end along with the hope in
which we boast.
1
Therefore, since the
children all have §flesh and
blood, Jesus himself took on
flesh and blood as well, so
that through death he might
destroy the one who has
the power of death, that is,
the devil, 15 and free those
who all their lives were held
in slavery by the fear of
death. 16 For surely it is

Christ, if indeed we hold our
original confidence firm to
the end. 15 As it is said,
“Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as
in the rebellion.”
16 For ‡some did rebel when
they heard God's voice, but
not all whom Moses led out
of Egypt. 17 Now with whom
was God angry for forty
years? Was it not with those
who sinned, whose bodies
fell in the wilderness? 18 And
to whom did God swear that
they would not enter his
rest, if not to those who were
disobedient? 19 So we see
that it was because of their
413
THE LETTER TO THE HEBREWS 4:7
unbelief that they were not
able to enter.
4
Therefore, while the
promise of entering his rest
remains open, let us proceed
with fear so that none of you
may be found to have fallen
short of it. 2 For we also have
received good news just as
they did. But the message
they heard did not benefit
them, since *they were not
united by faith with those
who listened. 3 For we who
have believed enter that
rest. As for the others, God
has said,
1
“As I swore in my wrath,
‘They will not enter my
rest!’ ”
Now God's works have been
finished from the founda-
tion of the world. 4 For in
one place it speaks about the
seventh day as follows: “On
the seventh day God rested
from all his works.” 5 But
again, God says in the pas-
sage above: “They will not
enter my rest!” 6 Therefore,
since God's rest remains
open for some to enter, and
those who formerly received
good news did not enter be-
cause of their disobedience,
7 he again designates a cer-
tain day, calling it “Today,”
as he says through David

already quoted,

“Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts.”
8 For
if Joshua had given
them rest, God would not
have spoken later about an-
other day. 9 So then, there
remains a Sabbath rest for
the people of God. 10 For
anyone who has entered
God's rest has rested from
his own works, just as God
rested from his.
11 Therefore let us make
every effort to enter that
rest, so that no one will fall
into the same pattern of dis-
obedience. 12 For the word
of God is living and active,
sharper than any two-edged
sword, piercing to the point
of dividing soul from spirit,
and joints from marrow, and
discerning the thoughts and
intentions of the heart. 13 No
creature is hidden from his
sight, but all are naked and
exposed to the eyes of him
to whom we must give an
account.

For every high priest
taken from among the peo-
ple is appointed to repre-
sent the people in matters
related to God, to offer gifts
and sacrifices for sins. 2 He
is able to deal gently with
those who are ignorant and
going astray, since he him-
self is subject to weakness.
3 That is why he is obligated
to offer sacrifices for his own
sins, as well as for the sins
of the people. 4 No one takes
this honor for himself, but
*receives it when he is called
by God, just as Aaron was.
5 In the same way, Christ
did not glorify himself in
becoming a high priest, but
was appointed by the one
who said to him,
1
Jesus the Great High “Yoʋ are my Son;

from death, and he was
heard because of his rever-
ence. 8 Even though he was
the Son, he learned obedi-
ence from what he suffered.
9 And having been made per-
fect, he became the source
of eternal salvation to all
who obey him 10 and was
designated by God as a high
priest according to the order
of Melchizedek.
11 On this topic we have
much to say, and it is hard
to explain, since you have
become sluggish in hearing.
12 For though you ought to
be teachers by this time,
you need someone to teach
you again the basic princi-
ples of the oracles of God.
You need milk, not solid
food. 13 Anyone who lives
on milk is unacquainted
with the teaching about righ-
teousness, for he is an in-
fant. 14 But solid food is for
the mature, whose faculties
have been trained by prac-
tice to distinguish between
good and evil.

Warning Against Falling
Away
1 Therefore, let us leave
behind
the
elementary
teaching about Christ and
go on to maturity, not
laying again a foundation
of repentance from dead
works and of faith in God,
2 and of instruction about
baptisms, the laying on
of hands, the resurrection
of the dead, and eternal

judgment. 3 And this we
will do, if God permits. 4 For
it is impossible to renew to
repentance those who have
once been enlightened, who
have tasted the heavenly
gift, who have shared in
the Holy Spirit, 5 who have
tasted the good word of
God and the powers of
the coming age, 6 and yet
have fallen away, since, to
their own harm, they are
crucifying the Son of God
all over again and exposing
him to public shame. 7 For
land that has drunk the
rain that often falls upon
it, and produces a crop
useful to those for whom
it is cultivated, receives a
blessing from God. 8 But
land that bears thorns and
thistles is worthless and on
the verge of being cursed; its
end is to be burned.
9 Even though we speak
in this way, beloved, we are
confident of better things in
your case, things that per-
tain to salvation. 10 For God
is not unjust; he will not
forget your work and the
*labor of love that you have
shown toward his name by
serving the saints, as you
still do. 11 We want each
one of you to show the same
earnestness to have the full
assurance of hope to the
very end, 12 so that you will
not be sluggish, but imita-
tors of those who inherit the
promises through faith and
patience.THE LETTER TO THE HEBREWS 6:13

The Certainty of God's
Promise
13 When God made his
promise to Abraham, since
he had no one greater to
swear by, he swore by him-
self, 14 saying, “I will surely
bless yoʋ and multiply yoʋ.”
15 And so Abraham, having
patiently endured, obtained

swear by someone greater
than themselves, and in ev-
ery dispute among them an
oath is final for confirma-
tion. 17 So when God wanted
to show the unchangeable
nature of his purpose even
more clearly to the heirs
of the promise, he guaran-
teed it with an oath, 18 so
that by two unchangeable
things, in which it is impos-
sible for God to lie, we who
have fled for refuge would
have strong encouragement
to take hold of the hope set
before us. 19 We have this
hope as a sure and steadfast
anchor for the soul. It enters
into the inner sanctuary be-
hind the veil, 20 where Jesus
has entered as a forerunner
for us, because he has be-
come a high priest forever
according to the order of
Melchizedek.
7
The Priestly Order of
Melchizedek
1 Now this Melchizedek
was king of Salem and priest
of God Most High. When
Abraham was returning
from the slaughter of the
* 7:4 even ¦ — SBL WH
THE LETTER TO THE HEBREWS 7:10
kings, Melchizedek met him
and blessed him, 2 and
Abraham gave him a tenth
of all the spoils. His name
means “king of righteous-
ness,” but he is also “king of
Salem,” which means, “king
of peace.” 3 He is without
father, without mother, and
without genealogy; there is
no beginning to his days
or end to his life.
But
resembling the Son of God,
he remains a priest forever.
4 Consider how great this
man must be, that *even
Abraham the patriarch gave
him a tenth of the spoils.

the priestly office to col-

who was not among the de-
scendants of Levi, received
a tithe from Abraham. He
also blessed Abraham, who
had received the promises.
7 It is beyond all dispute
that the inferior is blessed
by the superior. 8 In the
one case, tithes are received
by mortal men, but in the
other case, they are received
by one who is attested to
be living. 9 One might even
say that Levi himself, who
receives tithes, paid tithes
through Abraham. 10 For
Levi was still in the loins of
his ancestor Abraham when
Melchizedek met him.

Melchizedek
11 Now if perfection had
been attainable through the
Levitical priesthood (for un-
der this priesthood the peo-
ple received the law), what
further need would there
have been for another priest
to arise according to the or-
der of Melchizedek rather
than the order of Aaron?
12 For when the priesthood
is changed, the law must
also be changed. 13 Now
he of whom these things are
spoken belongs to a different
tribe, from which no one
has ever served at the altar.
14 For it is clear that our
Lord arose from Judah, and
in connection with that tribe
Moses said nothing about
†priesthood.
15 Now this point becomes
even more clear when there
arises another priest like
Melchizedek, 16 one who
has become a priest, not
through a legal requirement
concerning physical descent,
but through the power of
an endless life. 17 For ‡God
testifies,
“Yoʋ are a priest forever
according to the order of
Melchizedek.”
The former command-
ment is set aside because
it was weak and ineffective
19 (for the law made nothing
perfect), and a better hope
is introduced, by which we
draw near to God.
18
THE LETTER TO THE HEBREWS 7:28
And none of this
happened without an oath.
Aaron's descendants become
priests without an oath,
21 but Jesus was made a
priest with an oath by the
one who said to him,
20
“The Lord has sworn
and will not change his
mind,
‘Yoʋ are a priest forever
§according to the order of
Melchizedek.’ ”
22 Accordingly, Jesus has be-
come the guarantor of a bet-
ter covenant.
23 Now the former priests
were many in number, be-
cause they were prevented
by death from continuing
in office; 24 but because Je-
sus continues forever, he
has a permanent priesthood.
25 Therefore he is able to
save to the uttermost those
who come to God through
him, because he always lives
to intercede for them.
26 It was fitting for us to
have such a high priest, one
who is holy, innocent, un-
defiled, separated from sin-
ners, and exalted above the
heavens. 27 He has no need,
like the other high priests, to
offer up daily sacrifices, first
for his own sins, and then
for the sins of the people.
For he did this once for all
when he offered up himself.
28 For the law appoints as
high priests men who have
weakness, but the word of

23 So it was necessary for
the copies of the things in
heaven to be purified with
these sacrifices, but for the
heavenly things themselves
to be purified with better
sacrifices than these. 24 For
Christ did not enter holy
places made with hands,
which are copies of the true
ones; he entered heaven it-
self, so that he might ap-
pear now before God on
our behalf. 25 Nor did he
enter heaven to offer him-
self many times, as the high
priest enters the holy places
year after year with blood
that is not his own, 26 for
then he would have had to
suffer again and again since
the foundation of the world.
But now he has appeared
once for all at the end of the
ages to remove sin by the
sacrifice of himself. 27 And
just as it is appointed for
men to die once and then

is why he is the
mediator of a new covenant,
so that those who are called
may receive the promised
eternal inheritance, since a
death has occurred that re-
deems them from the trans-
gressions committed under
the first covenant. 16 For
in the case of a will, it is
necessary to establish the
death of the one who made
it, 17 because a will takes
effect only after the per-
son's death; it is §never in
force while the person who
made it is alive. 18 That is
why even the first covenant
was not inaugurated without
blood. 19 For when Moses
had proclaimed every com-
mandment of the law to all
the people, he took the blood
of calves *and goats, along
with water, scarlet wool, and
hyssop, and sprinkled the
scroll itself and all the peo-
ple, 20 saying, “This is the
blood of the covenant that
God has ordained for you.”
21 In the same way, he sprin-

form of those things, *the
same sacrifices that they
continually offer year after
year can never perfect those
who draw near to worship.
2 Otherwise, would they not
have ceased to be offered,
since the worshipers would
have been purified once and
for all, and would no longer
have any consciousness of
sins? 3 But in these sacrifices
there is a reminder of sins
year after year. 4 For it is
impossible for the blood of
bulls and goats to take away
sins.
5 Therefore, when Christ
came into the world, he said,
“Sacrifice and offering yoʋ
did not desire,
but a body yoʋ prepared for
me;
6 in whole burnt offerings
and sin offerings
yoʋ took no pleasure.
7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have
come to do yoʋr will,
O God,
as it is written about me
in the scroll of the
book.’ ”
8 In
the passage above he
says, “†Sacrifice and offer-
ing, and whole burnt offer-
ings and sin offerings you
did not desire, nor did you
take pleasure in them” (al-
though they are offered ac-
cording to the law), 9 Then
he adds, “Behold, I have

11 Now every priest stands
daily at service, offering
again and again the same

Christ had offered for all
time one sacrifice for sins,
he sat down at the right
hand of God, 13 where he
is now waiting until his en-
emies are made a footstool
for his feet. 14 For by one
offering he has perfected for
all time those who are being
sanctified.
15 The Holy Spirit also tes-
tifies to us about this. First
he says,
16 “This is the covenant I will
make with them
after those days, says the
Lord:
I will put my laws on their
hearts
and write them on their
minds.”
17 Then he adds,
“Their sins and their lawless
deeds I will remember
no more.”
18 Now
where there is re-
mission of these, there is no
longer any offering for sin.

The Discipline of the Lord
1 Therefore, since we have
such a great cloud of wit-
nesses surrounding us, let
us lay aside every weight
and the sin that so easily
entangles us, and let us run
with endurance the race that
lies before us, 2 fixing our
eyes upon Jesus, the author
and perfecter of our faith.
For the joy set before him
he endured the cross, disre-
garding its shame, and sat
down at the right hand of the
throne of God.
3 Consider him who en-
dured such opposition from
sinners against *himself, so
that you will not grow weary
or lose heart. 4 In your strug-
gle against sin, you have not
yet resisted to the point of
shedding your blood. 5 And
you have completely forgot-
ten the exhortation that ad-
dresses you as sons:
“My son, do not think lightly
of the discipline of the
Lord,
and do not lose heart when
he rebukes you.
6 For the Lord disciplines the
one he loves,
and he punishes every son
he receives.”

commended for their faith,
but they did not receive

have all had earthly fathers
who disciplined us, and we
respected them. Should we
not submit even more to the
Father of spirits and live?
10 For our fathers disciplined
us for a short time as seemed
best to them, but God dis-
ciplines us for our good, so
that we may share in his ho-
liness. 11 Now no discipline
seems pleasant at the time,
but painful. Later on, how-
ever, it produces the peace-
ful fruit of righteousness for
those trained by it.
12 Therefore,

your drooping hands and
strengthen your weak knees.
13 Make straight paths for
your feet, so that what is
lame may not be put out of
joint but healed instead.
14 Pursue peace with ev-
eryone, and holiness, for
without it no one will see
the Lord. 15 See to it that
no one falls short of the
grace of God and that no
root of bitterness springs up
and causes trouble, which
would result in many be-
coming defiled. 16 See to it
that there is no fornicator
or profane person like Esau,
who sold his birthright in
exchange for a single meal.

made the hearers beg that
no further word be spo-
ken to them. 20 For they
could not bear the order that
was given: “If even a beast
touches the mountain, it
shall be §stoned.” 21 Indeed,
the sight was so terrifying
that Moses said, “I am trem-
bling with fear.” 22 But you
have come to Mount Zion,
to the city of the living God,
the heavenly Jerusalem. You
have come to myriads of an-
gels, 23 to the festive gath-
ering and assembly of the
firstborn, whose names are
enrolled in heaven.
You
have come to God, the judge
of all, and to the spirits of
righteous people who have
been made perfect. 24 And
you have come to Jesus, the
mediator of a new covenant,
and to the sprinkled blood
that speaks *a better word

The Testing of Your Faith
Produces Endurance
2 Count it all joy, my broth-
ers, when you experience
various trials, 3 because you
know that the testing of your
faith produces endurance.
4 And let endurance have
its full effect, so that you
may be perfect and com-
plete, lacking in nothing. 5 If
any of you lacks wisdom, he
should ask God, who gives
generously to all without re-
proach, and it will be given
to him. 6 But he must ask
in faith without doubting,
for he who doubts is like a
wave of the sea, driven by
the wind and tossed about.
7 That person should not
expect to receive anything
from the Lord. 8 A double-
minded man is unstable in
all his ways.
The Lowly Brother and

9 The lowly brother should

So
also will the rich man fade
away in his pursuits.
Enduring Temptation
Blessed is the man
who endures temptation, for
when he has been approved,
he will receive the crown
of life, which *the Lord has
promised to those who love
him. 13 No one should say
when he is tempted, “I am
being tempted by God,” for
God is not tempted by evil,
and he himself tempts no
one. 14 But each person is
tempted when he is drawn
away and enticed by his own
evil desires. 15 And when
desire has conceived, it gives
birth to sin. And when sin is
fully grown, it brings forth
death.
16 Do not be deceived, my
beloved brothers. 17 Every
good and perfect gift is from
above, coming down from
the Father of lights, with
whom there is no variation
or shadow of turning. 18 Of
his own will he gave us birth
by the word of truth so that
we would be a kind of first-
fruits of his creatures.

22 But be doers of the word
and not hearers only, de-
ceiving yourselves. 23 For
if anyone is a hearer of the
‡word and not a doer, he
is like a man who looks at
his face in a mirror. 24 For
he looks at himself and goes
away, and then immediately
forgets what he looks like.
25 But he who looks into the
perfect law, the law of lib-
erty, and abides by it, §is not
a forgetful hearer but a doer
who acts. He will be blessed
in what he does.
26 If anyone *among you

“Abraham believed God, and
it was counted to him as

The Wisdom from Above
13 Who is wise and under-
standing among you? By
his good conduct he should
show that his works are
done with the gentleness
that comes from wisdom.
14 But if you have bitter jeal-
ousy and selfish ambition in
your hearts, do not boast or
deny the truth. 15 This is
not the wisdom that comes
down from above, but is
earthly, unspiritual, and de-
monic. 16 For where there
is jealousy and selfish am-
bition, there is disorder and
every evil practice. 17 But
the wisdom from above is
first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, easily entreated, full
of mercy and good fruits, im-
partial, and unhypocritical.
18 And the fruit of righteous-
ness is sown in peace by
those who make peace.

forgiven. 16 §Confess your

him; although you do not
now see him, you believe in
him and rejoice with an un-
speakable and glorious joy,
9 because you are receiving
the end result of your faith—
the salvation of your souls.
10 Concerning this salvation,
the prophets who prophe-
sied about the grace that
would come to you searched
and carefully investigated,
11 inquiring about the time
and circumstances that the
Spirit of Christ within them
was indicating when he tes-
tified in advance to the suf-
ferings of Christ and the
glories that would follow.
12 It was revealed to them
that they were not serv-
ing themselves, but §you,
in regard to the things that
have now been announced
to you through those who
preached the gospel to you
by the Holy Spirit sent from
heaven. Even angels long
to catch a glimpse of these
things.

Christ! In his great mercy he
caused us to be born again

7 Husbands, in the same
way, live with your wives

THE FIRST LETTER OF PETER 4:19
12 Beloved, do not be sur-
prised at the fiery trial that
has come upon you to test
you, as though a strange
thing were happening to
you. 13 But insofar as you
share in the sufferings of
Christ, rejoice, so that you
may also rejoice and be glad
when his glory is revealed.
14 If you are reproached for
the name of Christ, you are
blessed, because the Spirit
of *glory and of God †rests
upon you. ‡On their part he
is blasphemed, but on your
part he is glorified. 15 None
of you should suffer as a
murderer, thief, evildoer, or
meddler, 16 but if anyone
suffers as a Christian, he
should not be ashamed, but
should glorify God in this
§matter. 17 For it is time
for judgment to begin with
the household of God, and if
it begins first with us, what
will be the outcome for those
who are disobedient to the
gospel of God? 18 And,
“If the righteous man is
scarcely saved,
what will become of the
ungodly man and sin-
ner?”

fer according to the will
of God should entrust their

THE SECOND LETTER OF PETER 2:7
1 But there were also false
prophets among the peo-
ple, just as there will be
false teachers among you,
who will secretly bring in
destructive heresies. They
will even deny the Master
who bought them, bringing
upon themselves swift de-
struction. 2 Many will follow
their *sensual ways, and be-
cause of †them the way of
the truth will be maligned.
3 In their greed they will
exploit you with deceptive
words. Their condemnation
from of old is not idle, and
their destruction ‡will not
slumber.
4 For if God did not spare
angels when they sinned,
but cast them down to Tar-

to §chains of darkness to be
kept for judgment; 5 and if
he did not spare the ancient
world, but preserved Noah,

THE FIRST LETTER OF JOHN 2:22
I have written to you, young
men,
because you are strong,
and the word of God abides
in you,
and you have overcome the
evil one.
15 Do not love the world or
the things in the world. If
anyone loves the world, the
love of the Father is not in
him. 16 For all that is in the
world—the lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life—is not from the
Father, but from the world.
17 And the world is passing
away along with its lusts, but
whoever does the will of God
abides forever.
The Antichrist
18 Children, it is the last
hour, and just as you have
heard that §the antichrist
is coming, even now many
antichrists have come, by
which we know that it is
the last hour. 19 They went
out from us, but they did
not belong to us; for if they
had belonged to us, they
would have remained with
us. But they went out so
that it might be revealed that
they do not belong to us.
20 But you have an anointing
from the Holy One, and you
*know all things. 21 I have
not written to you because
you do not know the truth,
but because you know it,
and because no lie is of the
truth. 22 Who is the liar

is the Christ? This is the
antichrist, he who denies the
Father and the Son. 23 No
one who denies the Son has

let what you have heard
from the beginning abide in
you. If what you have heard
from the beginning abides in
you, then you will abide in

25 And this is what he has
promised us—eternal life.
26 I have written these
things to you concerning
those who are trying to de-
ceive you. 27 But the anoint-
ing you received from him
abides in you, and you have
no need for anyone to teach
you. But *the same anoint-
ing teaches you about all
things; it is true, not a lie. So,
just as it has taught you, †you
must abide in him.
Children of God
And now, little chil-
dren, abide in him, so that

have confidence and not be
ashamed before him at his
coming. 29 If you ‡know that

that everyone who practices
righteousness has been born

1 See what great love the
Father has lavished upon us,
THE FIRST LETTER OF JOHN 2:10
that we should be called chil-
dren of *God! The reason
the world does not know
†you is that it did not know
him. 2 Beloved, now we are
children of God, and what
we will be has not yet been
revealed. But we know that
when he appears, we will be
like him, because we will see
him as he is. 3 Everyone
who places this hope in him
purifies himself, just as he is
pure.
4 Everyone who practices
sin also practices lawless-
ness; sin is lawlessness. 5 But
you know that he appeared
in order to take away ‡our
sins, and in him there is no
sin. 6 No one who abides
in him continues in sin; no
one who continues in sin has
either seen him or known
him. 7 §Little children, let
no one deceive you. Who-
ever practices righteousness
is righteous, just as Jesus is
righteous. 8 Whoever prac-
tices sin is of the devil, for
the devil has been sinning
from the beginning. The rea-
son the Son of God appeared
was to destroy the works of
the devil. 9 No one who
has been born of God con-
tinues in sin, because God's
seed abides in him; he can-
not continue in sin, because
he has been born of God.

4 You are from God, little
children, and you have over-
come them, because greater
is he who is in you than he
who is in the world. 5 They
are from the world; there-
fore what they say is from
the world, and the world
listens to them. 6 We are
from God. Whoever knows
God listens to us; whoever is

Spirit of truth and the spirit

THE FIRST LETTER OF JOHN 5:1
14 And we have seen and we
testify that the Father has
sent the Son to be the Savior
of the world. 15 If anyone
confesses that §Jesus is the
Son of God, God abides in
him, and he in God. 16 And
we have come to know and
to believe the love that God
has for us.
God is love, and whoever
abides in love abides in God,
and God *abides in him.
17 By this, love is perfected
among us, so that we may
have confidence on the day
of judgment, because as he
is, so also are we in this
world. 18 There is no fear
in love, but perfect love casts
out fear, because fear has to
do with punishment. Who-
ever fears has not been per-
fected in love. 19 We love
†him because he first loved
us. 20 If anyone says, “I
love God,” and yet hates his
brother, he is a liar. For
he who does not love his
brother whom he has ‡seen,
how can he love God whom
he has not seen? 21 And
this is the commandment we
have from him: Whoever
loves God must also love his
brother.
God Is Love
Beloved, let us love
one another, because love
is from God, and every-
one who loves has been
born of God and knows God.
8 Whoever does not love
does not know God, because
God is love. 9 In this the love
of God was revealed among
us, that God sent his one and
only Son into the world so
that we might live through
him. 10 In this is love, not
that we loved God, but that
he loved us and sent his Son
to be the atoning sacrifice
for our sins. 11 Beloved, if
God loved us in this way,
5
we also ought to love one
another. 12 No one has ever

agreement. 9 If we receive
the testimony of men, we
should know that the testi-
mony of God is greater, be-
cause it is the testimony that
God has given about his Son.

mony, that God has given us
eternal life, and this life is in
his Son. 12 Whoever has the
Son has life; whoever does
not have the Son of God does
not have life.
The Knowledge of Eternal
Life
13 I have written these
things to you who believe in
the name of the Son of God
so that you may know that
you have eternal §life, and
so that you may believe *in
the name of the Son of God.
14 This is the confidence that
we have toward him, that
if we ask anything accord-
ing to his will, he hears us.
15 And if we know that he
hears us in whatever we ask,
we know that we have what
we have asked of him.
16 If anyone sees his
brother committing a sin
that does not lead to death,
he should pray for him, and
God will give him life. I refer
to those who commit sins
that do not lead to death.
There is sin that leads to
death; I do not say that he
should pray about that. 17 All
unrighteousness is sin, but
there is sin that does not lead
to death.
18 We know that no one
who has been born of God
continues in sin, but he

I was in the Spirit, and

on the *throne, 3 like

the throne was a rainbow
that looked like an emerald.

were seven flaming torches
burning before the throne;
these are the seven spirits of

was §something like a sea of
glass that looked like crystal.
THE REVELATION TO JOHN 4:11
the fourth †living creature
was like an eagle in flight.
8 Each of the four living
creatures had six wings and
was covered with eyes all
around and within. Day and
night they never stop saying,
“Holy, holy, ‡holy is the Lord
God Almighty,
who was and who is and
who is to come.”
9 And
whenever the living
creatures give glory, honor,
and thanks to him who sits
on the throne, who lives for-
ever and ever, 10 the twenty-
four elders fall down before
him who sits on the throne
and worship him who lives
forever and ever.
They
cast their crowns before the

1 Then I saw in the right

the throne a scroll written
on the inside and *outside,

2 And I saw a mighty angel
proclaiming with a loud
voice, “Who is worthy to
open the scroll and break
its seals?” 3 But no one in
heaven †above or on earth
or under the earth could
open the scroll or look into
it. 4 So I began to weep
loudly because no one was
found who was worthy to
‡open the scroll or look into

said to me, “Do not weep;

of incense, which are the

Praise from the Great
Multitude
9 After this I looked, and
behold, there was a great
multitude, which no one
could number, from every
nation, tribe, people, and
tongue, standing before the
throne and before the Lamb.
They were clothed in white
robes, §with palm branches
in their hands. 10 They were
crying out with a loud voice,
“Salvation belongs to *our
God, who sits on the †throne,
and to the Lamb.” 11 And all
the angels stood around the
throne and around the el-
ders and the four living crea-
tures, and they fell on their
faces before the throne and
worshiped God, 12 saying,
THE REVELATION TO JOHN 7:17
“Amen! Blessing, glory, and
wisdom,
thanksgiving and honor,
power and strength
be to our God forever and
ever! Amen.”
13 In response one of the
elders said to me, “Who
are these people clothed in
white robes, and where did
they come from?” 14 I said
to him, “Sir, yoʋ know.”
And he said to me, “These
are the ones coming out of
the great tribulation. They
have washed their robes and
made them white in the
blood of the Lamb.
15 Therefore they are before
the throne of God,
and they serve him day and

and he who sits on the

The Seventh Seal
1 When the Lamb opened
the seventh seal, there was
silence in heaven for about
half an hour. 2 And I saw
the seven angels who stand
before God, and seven trum-
pets were given to them.
3 Then another angel with
a golden censer came and
stood at the altar. He was
given a large amount of
incense to offer with the
prayers of all the saints on
the golden altar before the
throne. 4 And the smoke of
the incense, with the prayers
of the saints, ascended up
to God from the hand of
the angel. 5 Then the an-
gel took the censer, filled
it with fire from the altar,
and threw it to the earth,
and there were *peals of
thunder, rumblings, flashes
of lightning, and an earth-
quake.

10 The third angel sounded
his trumpet, and a great star
fell from heaven, burning
like a torch. It fell upon
a third of the rivers and
upon the springs of water.
11 The name of the star is
Wormwood, and a third §of

The

sounded his trumpet, and a
third of the sun was struck,
and a third of the moon
and a third of the stars, so
that a third of them were
darkened. A third of the day
was without light, and also a
third of the night.
13 Then I looked, and I
heard an *eagle saying †with
a loud voice as it flew di-
rectly overhead, “Woe, woe,

The Angel and the Little
Scroll
1 Then I saw *a mighty
angel coming down from
heaven, wrapped in a cloud,
with a rainbow over his
head; his face was like the
sun, and his feet were like
pillars of fire. 2 In his hand
he held †an open scroll. He
placed his right foot on the

sea and his left foot on the
land, 3 and cried out with a
loud voice, like a lion roar-
ing.
When he cried out,
the seven thunders sounded
their voices. 4 And when the
seven thunders ‡spoke, I was
about to write. But I heard a
voice from heaven §saying,
“Seal up what the seven
thunders have said, and *do
not write it down.” 5 Then
the angel I had seen stand-
ing on the sea and on the
land raised his †right hand
to heaven 6 and swore by
him who lives forever and
ever, who created heaven
and everything in it, the
earth and everything in it,
and the sea and everything
in it, and said that there
would no longer be delay,
7 but that in the days when
the seventh angel is about
to sound his trumpet, the
mystery of God would be
completed, ‡according to the
good news he announced to
his servants the prophets.
8 Then the voice I had
heard from heaven spoke to
me again, saying, “Go take
the §little scroll that is open
in the hand of the angel
who is standing on the sea
and on the land.” 9 So I
went over to the angel and

me, “Take the scroll and eat

bitter, but in yoʋr mouth it
will be as sweet as honey.”
10 So I took the †scroll from
the angel's hand and ate
it. In my mouth it was as
sweet as honey, but when
I had eaten it, my stomach
turned bitter. 11 Then I was
told, “Yoʋ must prophesy
again about many peoples,
nations, tongues, and kings.”
11
The Two Witnesses
1 Then I was given a mea-
suring rod like a staff, and *I
was told, “Rise and measure

they will prophesy for one

days, clothed in sackcloth.”

have the power to shut the

power over the waters to
turn them into blood and to
strike the earth with every
plague as often as they want.

some from among the peo-

nations will look at their
dead bodies and refuse to let
them be placed in *a tomb.
10 And those who dwell
on the earth will rejoice
over them and celebrate and
†give each other gifts, be-
cause these two prophets
had tormented those who
dwell on the earth. 11 But
after ‡the three and a half
days, the breath of life from
God entered them, and they
stood on their feet, and
great fear fell upon those
who were watching them.
12 Then §I heard a loud voice

while their enemies watched
them. 13 *On that day there
was a great earthquake, and
a tenth of the city fell. Seven
thousand people were killed
in the earthquake, and the
rest were terrified and gave
glory to the God of heaven.
14 The second woe has
passed. Behold, the third
woe is coming quickly.
The Seventh Trumpet
Then the seventh an-
gel sounded his trumpet,
and there were loud voices
in heaven, saying, “The
†kingdom of the world has
become the kingdom of our
Lord and of his Christ, and
he will reign forever and
ever.” 16 And the twenty-
four elders, who ‡sit on their
thrones before the throne of
God, fell on their faces and
worshiped God, 17 saying,

19 Then the temple of God
in heaven was opened, and
the ark of §the covenant of

temple.
And there were
flashes of lightning, rum-
blings, peals of *thunder,
and great hail.
12
The Woman and the
Dragon
1 Then a great sign ap-
peared in heaven: a woman
clothed with the sun, with
the moon under her feet and
a crown of twelve stars on
her head. 2 She was with
child and cried out in the
pain and agony of giving

The First Beast
1 Then *I stood on the
sand of the sea. And I saw
a beast coming up out of
the sea that had †ten horns
and seven heads, with ten
diadems on his horns and
‡blasphemous names on his
heads. 2 The beast I saw
was like a leopard; his feet
were like those of a bear,
and his mouth was like the
mouth of a lion. The dragon
gave the beast his power,
his throne, and great author-
ity. 3 §One of the beast's
heads appeared to be mor-
tally wounded. But its mor-
tal wound had been healed,
and *the whole world was

the dragon †that had given

and they also worshiped the
beast, saying, “Who is like
the beast, and who can wage

5 The
beast was given a
mouth to utter great boasts
THE REVELATION TO JOHN 13:10
and §blasphemy, and he was
*given authority to wage
war for forty-two months.
6 And he opened his mouth
to utter †blasphemy against
God and to slander his
‡name and his tabernacle,
that is, those who dwell in
heaven. 7 He was permit-
ted to wage war against the
saints and conquer them,
and he was given authority
over every tribe, §people,

who dwell on the earth
will worship him, *everyone

earth. He had §two horns

of his anger. He will be tor-

in the presence of the holy
angels and in the presence
of the Lamb. 11 And the
smoke of their torment goes
up forever and ever. There
is no rest day or night for
those who worship the beast
and his image or for anyone
who receives the mark of his
name.”
12 This calls for the en-
durance of the †saints, those
who keep the command-
ments of God and hold fast
to their faith in Jesus.
13 Then I heard a voice
‡saying,
from
heaven
“Write: ‘Blessed are the
dead who die in the Lord
from now on.’ ” “Yes,” says
the Spirit, “that they may
rest from their labors, §and
their works will follow
them.”
The Messages of the Three
Angels
6 Then I saw †an an-
gel flying directly overhead,
with an eternal gospel to
‡preach to those who dwell
on the earth, to every na-
tion, tribe, tongue, and peo-
ple. 7 He said with a loud
voice, “Fear §the Lord and
give him glory, because the
hour of his judgment has
come. Worship him who
made heaven and earth, the
sea and the springs of wa-
ter.”

a loud voice to him who
was sitting on the cloud,
“Take yoʋr sickle and reap,
because the hour †to reap
has come, for the harvest
of the earth is ripe.” 16 So
he who was sitting on the
cloud swung his sickle over
the earth, and the earth was
reaped.
17 Then another angel
came out of the temple in
heaven; he too had a sharp
sickle. 18 And another angel,
who had authority over the
fire, came out from the
altar and called out with
a loud ‡cry to the angel
who had the sharp sickle,
“Take yoʋr sharp sickle and
gather the clusters §from
the vintage of the earth, for
*its grapes are ripe.” 19 So
the angel swung his sickle
across the earth, gathered
the vintage of the earth,
and threw it into the great
winepress of the wrath of
God. 20 Then the winepress
was trodden outside the
city, and blood came out
of the winepress, as high
as a horse's bridle, for
one thousand six hundred
stadia.Seven Plagues
1 Then I saw another
great and marvelous sign
in heaven: seven angels
with the seven final plagues,
because with them the
wrath of God is completed.
2 I also saw something like
a sea of glass mixed with
fire, and those who had
overcome *the beast, his im-
age, †and the number of his
name were standing by the
sea of glass, holding ‡harps
from God. 3 They sang the

the seven angels with the
seven *plagues. They were
clothed in pure bright †linen,
with golden sashes wrapped
around their chests. 7 Then
one of the four living
creatures gave the seven
angels seven golden bowls
full of the wrath of God,
who lives forever and ever.
8 And the temple was filled
with smoke from the glory
of God and from his power,
and no one could enter
the temple until the seven

12 The sixth angel poured
out his bowl on the great
river Euphrates, and its wa-

the way for the kings of the
east. 13 Then I saw three
unclean spirits that looked
like frogs coming out of the
mouth of the dragon, out
of the mouth of the beast,
and out of the mouth of the
false prophet. 14 They are
demonic spirits performing
†signs, who go out to the
kings ‡of the whole world

sembled the kings at the

poured out his bowl into

came from the throne of *the

The Great Prostitute and
the Beast
1 Then one of the seven
angels who had the seven
bowls came and said to me,
“Come, I will show yoʋ the
judgment of the great pros-
titute who sits on many wa-
ters. 2 With her the kings
of the earth have committed
fornication, and those who
dwell on the earth have be-
come drunk with the wine

carried me away in the Spirit
to a wilderness, and I saw
a woman sitting on a scarlet
beast that was full of blas-
phemous names and had
seven heads and ten horns.

The Fall of Babylon the
Great
1 After this I saw *another
angel coming down from
heaven. He had great au-
thority, and the earth was
illuminated with his glory.
2 He cried out †with a mighty
voice,
“‡Fallen is Babylon the great!
She has become a dwelling
place for demons,
a haunt for every unclean
§spirit,
and a haunt for every un-
clean and hated bird.
3 For all the nations have
*fallen
because of the †wine of the
wrath of her fornica-
tion.
The kings of the earth have
committed fornication
with her,
and the merchants of the
earth have become
rich from the power
of her luxury.”
4 Then I heard another voice
from heaven say,

THE REVELATION TO JOHN 19:18
The Rider on the White
Horse
11 Then I saw heaven
opened, and behold, a white
horse! Its rider is called
Faithful and True, and in
righteousness he judges and
wages war. 12 His eyes are
‡a flame of fire, and on
his head are many diadems.
§Names were written on
him, including a name that
no one knows but he him-
self. 13 He is clothed with
a garment *dipped in blood,
and his name is the Word
of God. 14 The armies of
heaven, clothed in fine linen,
white and pure, were fol-
lowing him on white horses.
15 Out of his mouth comes
a sharp †two-edged sword
with which he can strike
down the nations, and he
will rule them with a rod
of iron. He will tread the
winepress of the fury ‡of the
wrath of God, the Almighty.
16 On his garment and on his
thigh is written the name:
“King of kings and Lord of
lords.”
17 Then I saw an angel
standing in the sun, and
he cried out with a loud
voice, saying to all the birds
that were flying directly
overhead, “Come, gather to-
gether for the §great supper
of God, 18 so that you may eat

of commanders, the flesh of

teous acts of the saints.
9 Then the angel said to
me, “Write: ‘Blessed are
those who are invited to
the marriage supper of the
Lamb.’ ” He also said to me,
“These are the true words
of God.” 10 Then I fell at
his feet to worship him, but
he said to me, “Do not do
that! I am a fellow servant of
yoʋrs, and of yoʋr brothers
who hold to the testimony of
Jesus. Worship God.” For
the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.

of them were thrown alive
into the lake of fire that

that came out of the mouth
of the rider on the horse, and
all the birds gorged them-
selves on their flesh.

489
THE REVELATION TO JOHN 20:8
He threw him into the
abyss and †locked and sealed
it over him, so that he
would no longer deceive the
nations until the thousand
years were completed. After
that he must be released for
a short time.
4 Then I saw thrones, and
those who sat on them were
given authority to judge. I
also saw the souls of those
who had been beheaded
for the testimony of Jesus
and for the word of God.
They had not worshiped
the beast or his image and
had not received the mark
on their foreheads or their
hands. They came to life and
reigned with Christ for ‡the
thousand years. 5 §(The rest
of the dead did not come to
life until the thousand years
were completed.) This is the

up over the breadth of the
earth and surrounded the

The New Heaven and the
New Earth
1 Then I saw a new heaven
and a new earth, for the
first heaven and the first
earth had passed away, and
the sea was no more. 2 *I
also saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down out
of heaven from God, pre-
pared like a bride adorned
3 And
for her husband.
I heard a loud voice from
†heaven saying, “Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with
men. He will dwell with
them, and they will be his
people, and God himself will
be with ‡them. 4 He will
wipe away every tear from
their eyes. Death will be

longer be mourning, crying,

things have passed away.”

throne said, “Behold, I am

fore ‡the throne, and books
were opened. Then another
book was opened, which
is the book of life.
And
the dead were judged by
what was written in the
books, according to their
works. 13 Then the sea gave
up the dead who were in
it, and Death and Hades
gave up the dead who were

The New Jerusalem
one of the seven
angels who had the seven
bowls full of the seven final
plagues ‡came and said to
me, “Come, I will show yoʋ
the §wife, the bride of the
Lamb.” 10 And he carried
me away in the Spirit to
a great and high mountain
and showed me the *great
city, the holy Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven
from God. 11 The city shone
9 Then
THE REVELATION TO JOHN 21:17
with the glory of God, and
its radiance was like a very
precious stone, like a jasper
stone, clear as crystal. 12 It
had a great, high wall with
twelve gates.
Twelve an-
gels were at the gates, and
on the gates were written
the names of the twelve
tribes of the sons of Israel.
13 There were three gates
on the east, three gates on
the north, three gates on the
south, and three gates on the
west. 14 The wall of the city
had twelve foundations, and
on them were the †twelve
names of the twelve apostles
of the Lamb.
15 The angel who spoke to
me had a golden ‡measuring
rod to measure the §city,
its gates, and its wall.
16 The city is laid out as
a square; its length is the
same as its width.
The
angel measured the city
with the rod and found
it to be twelve thousand
stadia. (The length, width,
and height were all *equal,
each
measuring
twelve
thousand stadia.) 17 †Then
he measured its wall and

18 The wall was made of
jasper, while the city was
pure gold, like clear glass.
19 The foundations of the
city wall were adorned with
every kind of precious stone.
The first foundation stone
was jasper; the second,
sapphire; the third, agate;
the fourth, emerald; 20 the

each one of the gates was
made of a single pearl, and
the street of the city was
pure gold, like transparent
glass.
22 I did not see a temple
in the city, for the Lord God
Almighty is its temple, and
so is the Lamb. 23 The city
has no need of sun or moon
to ‡shine upon it, for the
glory of God gives it light,
and its lamp is the Lamb.

The River of Life and the
Tree of Life
1 Then the angel showed
me a *pure river of the wa-
ter of life, as bright as crys-
tal, flowing from the throne
of God and of the Lamb.
2 In the middle of the city
street, and on each side of
the river, is the tree of life,
bearing twelve kinds of fruit,
yielding its fruit each month.
And the leaves of the tree
are for the healing of the
nations. 3 †No longer will
there be anything accursed,
but the throne of God and of
the Lamb will be in the city,
and his servants will serve
him. 4 They will see his face,
