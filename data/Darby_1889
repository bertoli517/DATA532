8 I do not speak as commanding
[it], but through the zeal of others,
and proving the genuineness of
9 your 0 love. For yo know the
grace of onr Lord Jesus Christ,
that for your sakes he being rich
became poor, in order that ye by
h is poverty might be enriched.
10 And I give [my] opinion in this,
for this is profitable for you wlio
began before, not only to do, but
also to be -willing, a year ago.
11 But now also complete tho doing
of it; so that as [there was] the
readiness to be willing, so also to
complete out of what yo have.
12 For if the readiness be there, [a
man isj accepted ^ according to
what he * may have, not according
13 to what he has not. For [it is]
not in order ttiat there may be
case for others, and for you dis-
14 tress, but [on the principle] of
equality ; in the present time your
abundance for their lack, that
their abundance may be for your
lack, so that there should, be
15 equality.
According as it is
written, He who [gathered] much
had no excess, and he who [gath­
ered] little was nothing short.
10 But thanks [be] to God, who
gives the same diligent zeal for
17 you in the heart of Titus. For he
received indeed the entreaty, but,
being full of zeal, he went of his
IH own accord to y o u ; but we have
sent with him tho brother whose
praise [is] in the glad tidings
through all the assemblies; and
not only [so], but [is] also chosen
by the assemblies as our fellow-
traveller with this grace, minis­
tered by us to the glory of the
Lord himself, and [a witness of]
■n2 ourJ readiness;
avoiding this,
that any one should blame us in
this abundance [which is) ad-
-;1 ministered by ur ; for * we provide 1
for things honest, not only before
[the] Lord, but also before men.
22 And we have sent with them our
brother whom we have often
proved to bo of diligent zeal in
many things, and now more dili­
gently zealous through the great
confidence [he has] as to you.
23 Whether as regards Titus, [he is]
my companion and fellow-labourer
in your behalf; or onr brethren,
[they are] deputed messengers of
24 assemblies, Christ’s glory. Shew
therefore to them, m before the
C h ap . 9 ,

assemblies, the proof of your lov 〇,
and of our boasting aboxit you.
For concerning the ministration
which [is] for the saints, it is
superfluous m y writing to you.
2 For I know your readiness, which
I boast of as respects you to
Macedonians, that Achaia is pre­
pared since a year ago, and the
zeal [reported] of you has stimu­
lated the mass [of the brethren].
3 But I have sent the brethren, in
order that our boasting about you
may not be made void in this
respect, in order that, as I have
4 said, ye may be prepared; lest
haply, if Macedonians come with
me and find you unprepared, w e,
that we say not ye, may be pxit to
5 shame in this confidence.71 I
thought it necessary therefore to
beg the brethren that they would
come to you, and complete before­
hand your fore*announced bless­
ing, that this may be ready thus
as blessing, and not as got out of
6 you ， But this [is true], he that
sows sparingly shall reap also
sparingly; and ho that sows in
[the spirit of] blessing shall reap
7 also in blessing: each according
as he is purposed in his heart; not
grievinglj^,^ or of necessity; for
8 God loves a cheerful griver. But
God is able to make every gracious
gift abound towards you, that,
having in every way always all-
sufficiency, ye may abound to
9 every good w ork: according as
it is written, He has scattered
abroad, he lias given to tho poor,
his righteousness remains for ever.
10 Now he that supplies seed to the
sower and bread for eating shall3
supply and make abundant 3rour
sowing, and increase the fruits of
11 your righteousness: enriched in
every way unto all free-hearted
liberality, which works through us
12 thanksgiving to God. Because the
ministration of this service is not
only filling up the measure of what
is lacking to the saints, but also
abounding by many thanksgiv-
13 ings to God ; they glorifying God
through the proof of this ministra­
tion, by reason of your subjection,
by profession, to the glad tidings
of the Christ, and your free-hearted
liberality in communicating to-
14 wards them and towards a ll; and
in their supplication for you, full
of ardent desire for you, on account

Chap. 5, v. i.
Wherefore, holy brethren, par­
takers of [the] heavenly calling,
consider the Apostle and High
Priest of our confession, fcJesu6,
2 who is faithful to him that has
constituted him, as Moses also
3 in all his house. For he has been
counted worthy of greater glory
than Moses, by how much he that
has built it has more honour than
4 the house. For every house is
built by some on e; but ho who
5 has built all things [is] God. And
Moses indeed [was] faithful in all
his house, as a ministering ser­
vant, for a testimony of the things
C to bo spoken after; but Christ, as
Son over hia house, whose house
are we, if indeed we hold fast the
boldness and the boast of hopo
Ann to the end.
7 When'forc, even as sajrs the
Holy Spirit, To-day if yc will hear
8 his voice, harden not your hearts,
as in the provocation, in the day
of temptation in the wilderness;
9 where your fathers tempted Cme],
by proving [me], and saw my
10 works forty years. Wherefore I
was wroth with this* generation,
and said, They always err in heart;
and they have not known my
11 ways ; so I swore in my wrath, If
12 they shall enter into my rest. Sec,
brethren, lest there be in any one
of you a wicked heart of \mbelief,
in turning away from [the] living
13 God. But encourage yourselves^
each day, as long as it is called
To-day, that none of you bo
hardened by the deccitfulness of
14 sin. For we are become com ­
panions of the Christ if indeed wc
hold the beginning of the assur-
la ancc firm to the en d; in that it is
said, To-day if ye will hear his
voice, do not harden your hearts,
1G as in the provocation; (for >vho
was it, who, having heard, pro­
voked ? but [was it] n o tn all
who came out of Egypt by Moses ?
17 And with whom was he wroth forty
years ? [Was it] not with those who
had sinned, whose carcases fell in
18 tho wilderness ? And to whom
sware he that they should not enter
into his rest, but to those who
had not hearkened to the word ?
19 And we see that they could not
enter in on account of unboliof;)
indeed we have had glad tidings
presented to us, even as they also ;
but the word of the report did
not profit them, not being mixed
with faith in those who heard.
3 For we enter into the rest who
have believed; as he said, As I
have sworn in my wrath, If they
shall enter into my rest; although
the works had been completed
from [the} foundation of [the]
4 world. For he has said somewhere
of the seventh [day] thus, And
God rested on the seventh day
5 from all his works: and in this
again, If they shall enter into my
6 rest. Seeing therefore it remains
that some enter into it, and those*
who first received the glad tidings
did not enter in on account of not
7 hearkening to the word, again he
determines a certain day, saying,
in David, ' T o-day/ after so long
a tim e; (according as it has been
said "before。〉
， To-day, if ye will
hear his voice, liarden not your
8 hearts. For if Jesus p had brought
them into rest, he would not have
spoken afterwards about another
9 day.
There remains then a
sabbatism to the people of God.
10 For ho that has entered into his
rest, ho also has rested from bis
works, as God did from his own.
11 Let us therefore use diligence to
enter into that rest, that no one
may fall after the same example of
12 not hearkening to the word. For
the word of God [is] living and
operative， and sharper tiian any
two-edged sword, and penetrating
to [the] division Qof soul and spirit ,
both of joints and marrow, and
a disccrner of the thoughts and
13 intents of [the] heart. And there
is not a creature unapparent before
him ; but all things [are] naked
and laid bare to his eyes, with
whom wc have to do.
U Having therefore a great high
priest -who has passed through tLo
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let
15 us hold fast the confession. For
wo have not a higrh priest not able
to sympathise with our infirmities,
but tempted in all things in like
10 manner/ sin apart. Let us ap­
proach therefore with boldness to
the throne of grace, that we may
receive mercy, and find grace for
seasonable help.
For every high priest taken
his rest, any one of you migtit
from amongst men is established

JOHN

The elder to [the] elect lady and
her children, whom I love in truth,
and not I only but also all who
2 have known the trutji， for the
truths sake which abides in us and
3 shall be with us to eternity. Grace
shall be with you, mercy, peace
from God [the] Father, and from
[the] Lord Jos\is Christ, the Son of
the Father, in truth and love.
1 I rejoiced greatly that I have
found of thy children walking in
truth, as we have received com-
5 mandment from the Father. And
now I beseech thee, lady, not as
writing to thee a new command­
ment, but that which we have had
from [the] beginning, that we
6 should love one another. And this
is love, that we should walk ac­
cording to his commandments.
This is the commandment, accord­
ing as ye have heard from the
beginning, that ye might walk in
7 it. For many deceivers have gone
out a into the world, they who
do not confess Je6us Christ coming
in flesh—
— this is the deceiver and
8 the antichrist. See to yourselves,
that we may not lose what we
have wrought, but may receive
9 full wages. Whosoever goes for­
ward6 and abides not in the
doctrine of the Christ has not God.
He that abides in the doctrine,6
he has both the Father and the
10 Son. If any one come to you and
bring not this doctrine, do not
receive him into [the] house, and
11 greet him n o t; for he who greets
him partakes in his wicked works.
12 Having many things to write
to you, I would not with paper
and ink ; but hope to come to you,
and to speak mouth to mouth,
that our joy may be full.

sister greet thee.c
