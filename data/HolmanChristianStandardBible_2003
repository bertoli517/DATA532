Matthew
1
1 The historical record of Jesus
Christ, the Son of David, the Son of
Abraham:
2 Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac
fathered Jacob, Jacob fathered Judah
and his brothers,
3 Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by
Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron
fathered Aram,
4 Aram fathered Aminadab, Aminadab
fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered
Salmon,
5 Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz
fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered
Jesse,
6 and Jesse fathered King David. Then
David fathered Solomon by Uriah's wife,MATTHEW 1
2
7 Solomon fathered Rehoboam,
Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah
fathered Asa,
8 Asa fathered Jehoshaphat,
Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram
fathered Uzziah,
9 Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham
fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
10 Hezekiah fathered Manasseh,
Manasseh fathered Amon, Amon
fathered Josiah,
11 and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and
his brothers at the me of the exile to
Babylon.
12 Then a er the exile to Babylon
Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, Salathiel
fathered Zerubbabel,
13 Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud
fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,
14 Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered
Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,MATTHEW 1
3
15 Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar
fathered Ma han, Ma han fathered
Jacob,
16 and Jacob fathered Joseph the
husband of Mary, who gave birth to
Jesus who is called the Messiah.
17 So all the genera ons from Abraham
to David were 14 genera ons; and
from David un l the exile to Babylon,
14 genera ons; and from the exile
to Babylon un l the Messiah, 14
genera ons.
18 The birth of Jesus Christ came
about this way: A er His mother Mary
had been engaged to Joseph, it was
discovered before they came together
that she was pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
19 So her husband Joseph, being a
righteous man, and not wan ng to
disgrace her publicly, decided to divorce
her secretly.MATTHEW 1
20 But a
4
er he had considered these
things, an angel of the Lord suddenly
appeared to him in a dream, saying,
"Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to
take Mary as your wife, because what
has been conceived in her is by the Holy
Spirit.
21 She will give birth to a son, and you
are to name Him Jesus, because He will
save His people from their sins."
22 Now all this took place to fulﬁll what
was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet:
23 See, the virgin will become pregnant
and give birth to a son, and they
will name Him Immanuel , which is
translated "God is with us."
24 When Joseph got up from sleeping,
he did as the Lord's angel had
commanded him. He married herMATTHEW 1 – 2
25 but did not know her in
5
mately un l
she gave birth to a son. And he named
Him Jesus.
1 A er Jesus was born in Bethlehem
of Judea in the days of King
Herod, wise men from the east arrived
unexpectedly in Jerusalem,
2 saying, "Where is He who has been
born King of the Jews? For we saw
His star in the east and have come to
worship Him."
3 When King Herod heard this, he was
deeply disturbed, and all Jerusalem with
him.
4 So he assembled all the chief priests
and scribes of the people and asked
them where the Messiah would be born.
5 "In Bethlehem of Judea," they told
him, "because this is what was wri en
by the prophet:
6 And you, Bethlehem, in the land of
Judah, are by no means least among the
2MATTHEW 2
6
leaders of Judah: because out of you will
come a leader who will shepherd My
people Israel. "
7 Then Herod secretly summoned the
wise men and asked them the exact me
the star appeared.
8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said,
"Go and search carefully for the child.
When you ﬁnd Him, report back to me
so that I too can go and worship Him."
9 A er hearing the king, they went on
their way. And there it was--the star they
had seen in the east! It led them un l
it came and stopped above the place
where the child was.
10 When they saw the star, they were
overjoyed beyond measure.
11 Entering the house, they saw the
child with Mary His mother, and falling
to their knees, they worshiped Him.
Then they opened their treasuresMATTHEW 2
7
and presented Him with gi s: gold,
frankincense, and myrrh.
12 And being warned in a dream not to
go back to Herod, they returned to their
own country by another route.
13 A er they were gone, an angel of the
Lord suddenly appeared to Joseph in a
dream, saying, "Get up! Take the child
and His mother, ﬂee to Egypt, and stay
there un l I tell you. For Herod is about
to search for the child to destroy Him."
14 So he got up, took the child and His
mother during the night, and escaped to
Egypt.
15 He stayed there un l Herod's death,
so that what was spoken by the Lord
through the prophet might be fulﬁlled:
Out of Egypt I called My Son.
16 Then Herod, when he saw that he
had been outwi ed by the wise men,
ﬂew into a rage. He gave orders to
massacre all the male children in andMATTHEW 2
8
around Bethlehem who were two years
old and under, in keeping with the me
he had learned from the wise men.
17 Then what was spoken through
Jeremiah the prophet was fulﬁlled:
18 A voice was heard in Ramah,
weeping, and great mourning, Rachel
weeping for her children; and she
refused to be consoled, because they
were no more.
19 A er Herod died, an angel of the
Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to
Joseph in Egypt,
20 saying, "Get up! Take the child and
His mother and go to the land of Israel,
because those who sought the child's
life are dead."
21 So he got up, took the child and His
mother, and entered the land of Israel.
22 But when he heard that Archelaus
was ruling over Judea in place of his
father Herod, he was afraid to go there.MATTHEW 2 – 3
9
And being warned in a dream, he
withdrew to the region of Galilee.
23 Then he went and se led in a town
called Nazareth to fulﬁll what was
spoken through the prophets, that He
will be called a Nazarene.
1 In those days John the Bap st
came, preaching in the Wilderness
of Judea
2 and saying, "Repent, because the
kingdom of heaven has come near!"
3 For he is the one spoken of through
the prophet Isaiah, who said: A voice
of one crying out in the wilderness:
"Prepare the way for the Lord; make His
paths straight!"
4 John himself had a camel-hair
garment with a leather belt around his
waist, and his food was locusts and wild
honey.
3MATTHEW 3
10
5 Then people from Jerusalem, all
Judea, and all the vicinity of the Jordan
were ﬂocking to him,
6 and they were bap zed by him in the
Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
7 When he saw many of the Pharisees
and Sadducees coming to the place of
his bap sm, he said to them, "Brood of
vipers! Who warned you to ﬂee from the
coming wrath?
8 Therefore produce fruit consistent
with repentance.
9 And don't presume to say to
yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our
father.' For I tell you that God is able
to raise up children for Abraham from
these stones!
10 Even now the ax is ready to strike the
root of the trees! Therefore every tree
that doesn't produce good fruit will be
cut down and thrown into the ﬁre.MATTHEW 3
11 "I bap
11
ze you with water for
repentance, but the One who is coming
a er me is more powerful than I. I am
not worthy to take oﬀ His sandals. He
Himself will bap ze you with the Holy
Spirit and ﬁre.
12 His winnowing shovel is in His hand,
and He will clear His threshing ﬂoor and
gather His wheat into the barn. But the
chaﬀ He will burn up with ﬁre that never
goes out."
13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John
at the Jordan, to be bap zed by him.
14 But John tried to stop Him, saying, "I
need to be bap zed by You, and yet You
come to me?"
15 Jesus answered him, "Allow it for
now, because this is the way for us to
fulﬁll all righteousness." Then he allowed
Him to be bap zed .
16 A er Jesus was bap zed, He went
up immediately from the water. TheMATTHEW 3 – 4
12
heavens suddenly opened for Him, and
He saw the Spirit of God descending like
a dove and coming down on Him.
17 And there came a voice from heaven:
This is My beloved Son. I take delight in
Him!
1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit
into the wilderness to be tempted by
the Devil.
2 A er He had fasted 40 days and 40
nights, He was hungry.
3 Then the tempter approached Him
and said, "If You are the Son of God, tell
these stones to become bread."
4 But He answered, "It is wri en: Man
must not live on bread alone but on
every word that comes from the mouth
of God. "
5 Then the Devil took Him to the holy
city, had Him stand on the pinnacle of
the temple,
4MATTHEW 4
13
6 and said to Him, "If You are the Son
of God, throw Yourself down. For it is
wri en: He will give His angels orders
concerning you and, they will support
you with their hands so that you will not
strike your foot against a stone. "
7 Jesus told him, "It is also wri en: Do
not test the Lord your God. "
8 Again, the Devil took Him to a very
high mountain and showed Him all
the kingdoms of the world and their
splendor.
9 And he said to Him, "I will give You
all these things if You will fall down and
worship me."
10 Then Jesus told him, "Go away,
Satan! For it is wri en: Worship the Lord
your God, and serve only Him. "
11 Then the Devil le Him, and
immediately angels came and began to
serve Him.MATTHEW 4
14
12 When He heard that John had been
arrested, He withdrew into Galilee.
13 He le Nazareth behind and went
to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the
region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
14 This was to fulﬁll what was spoken
through the prophet Isaiah:
15 Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
along the sea road, beyond the Jordan,
Galilee of the Gen les!
16 The people who live in darkness have
seen a great light, and for those living
in the shadowland of death, light has
dawned.
17 From then on Jesus began to preach,
"Repent, because the kingdom of heaven
has come near!"
18 As He was walking along the Sea of
Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon,
who was called Peter, and his brother
Andrew. They were cas ng a net into the
sea, since they were ﬁshermen.MATTHEW 4
15
19 "Follow Me," He told them, "and I
will make you ﬁsh for people!"
20 Immediately they le their nets and
followed Him.
21 Going on from there, He saw two
other brothers, James the son of
Zebedee, and his brother John. They
were in a boat with Zebedee their father,
mending their nets, and He called them.
22 Immediately they le the boat and
their father and followed Him.
23 Jesus was going all over Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, preaching
the good news of the kingdom, and
healing every disease and sickness
among the people.
24 Then the news about Him spread
throughout Syria. So they brought to
Him all those who were aﬄicted, those
suﬀering from various diseases and
intense pains, the demon-possessed,MATTHEW 4 – 5
16
the epilep cs, and the paraly cs. And
He healed them.
25 Large crowds followed Him from
Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and
beyond the Jordan.
1 When He saw the crowds, He went
up on the mountain, and a er He sat
down, His disciples came to Him.
2 Then He began to teach them, saying:
3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
4 Blessed are those who mourn,
because they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the gentle, because they
will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst for righteousness, because they
will be ﬁlled.
7 Blessed are the merciful, because they
will be shown mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, because
they will see God.
5MATTHEW 5
17
9 Blessed are the peacemakers, because
they will be called sons of God.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted
for righteousness, because the kingdom
of heaven is theirs.
11 "Blessed are you when they insult
you and persecute you and falsely say
every kind of evil against you because of
Me.
12 Be glad and rejoice, because your
reward is great in heaven. For that is
how they persecuted the prophets who
were before you.
13 "You are the salt of the earth. But if
the salt should lose its taste, how can
it be made salty? It's no longer good
for anything but to be thrown out and
trampled on by men.
14 "You are the light of the world. A city
situated on a hill cannot be hidden.MATTHEW 5
18
15 No one lights a lamp and puts it under
a basket, but rather on a lampstand, and
it gives light for all who are in the house.
16 In the same way, let your light shine
before men, so that they may see your
good works and give glory to your Father
in heaven.
17 "Don't assume that I came to destroy
the Law or the Prophets. I did not come
to destroy but to fulﬁll.
18 For I assure you: Un l heaven and
earth pass away, not the smallest le er
or one stroke of a le er will pass from
the law un l all things are accomplished.
19 Therefore, whoever breaks one of
the least of these commandments and
teaches people to do so will be called
least in the kingdom of heaven. But
whoever prac ces and teaches these
commandments will be called great in
the kingdom of heaven.MATTHEW 5
19
20 For I tell you, unless your
righteousness surpasses that of
the scribes and Pharisees, you will never
enter the kingdom of heaven.
21 "You have heard that it was said
to our ancestors, Do not murder , and
whoever murders will be subject to
judgment.
22 But I tell you, everyone who is
angry with his brother will be subject
to judgment. And whoever says to
his brother, 'Fool!' will be subject to
the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You
moron!' will be subject to hellﬁre.
23 So if you are oﬀering your gi on the
altar, and there you remember that your
brother has something against you,
24 leave your gi there in front of the
altar. First go and be reconciled with
your brother, and then come and oﬀer
your gi .MATTHEW 5
25 Reach a se
20
lement quickly with
your adversary while you're on the way
with him, or your adversary will hand
you over to the judge, the judge to the
oﬃcer, and you will be thrown into
prison.
26 I assure you: You will never get out of
there un l you have paid the last penny!
27 "You have heard that it was said, Do
not commit adultery.
28 But I tell you, everyone who looks
at a woman to lust for her has already
commi ed adultery with her in his heart.
29 If your right eye causes you to sin,
gouge it out and throw it away. For it is
be er that you lose one of the parts of
your body than for your whole body to
be thrown into hell.
30 And if your right hand causes you to
sin, cut it oﬀ and throw it away. For it is
be er that you lose one of the parts ofMATTHEW 5
21
your body than for your whole body to
go into hell!
31 "It was also said, Whoever divorces
his wife must give her a wri en no ce of
divorce.
32 But I tell you, everyone who divorces
his wife, except in a case of sexual
immorality, causes her to commit
adultery. And whoever marries a
divorced woman commits adultery.
33 "Again, you have heard that it was
said to our ancestors, You must not
break your oath, but you must keep your
oaths to the Lord.
34 But I tell you, don't take an oath at
all: either by heaven, because it is God's
throne;
35 or by the earth, because it is His
footstool; or by Jerusalem, because it is
the city of the great King.MATTHEW 5
22
36 Neither should you swear by your
head, because you cannot make a single
hair white or black.
37 But let your word 'yes' be 'yes,' and
your 'no' be 'no.' Anything more than
this is from the evil one.
38 "You have heard that it was said, An
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
39 But I tell you, don't resist an evildoer.
On the contrary, if anyone slaps you on
your right cheek, turn the other to him
also.
40 As for the one who wants to sue you
and take away your shirt, let him have
your coat as well.
41 And if anyone forces you to go one
mile, go with him two.
42 Give to the one who asks you, and
don't turn away from the one who wants
to borrow from you.
43 "You have heard that it was said, Love
your neighbor and hate your enemy.MATTHEW 5 – 6
23
44 But I tell you, love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you,
45 so that you may be sons of your
Father in heaven. For He causes His sun
to rise on the evil and the good, and
sends rain on the righteous and the
unrighteous.
46 For if you love those who love you,
what reward will you have? Don't even
the tax collectors do the same?
47 And if you greet only your brothers,
what are you doing out of the ordinary?
Don't even the Gen les do the same?
48 Be perfect, therefore, as your
heavenly Father is perfect.
1 "Be careful not to prac ce your
righteousness in front of people, to
be seen by them. Otherwise, you will
have no reward from your Father in
heaven.
2 So whenever you give to the poor,
don't sound a trumpet before you, as the
6MATTHEW 6
24
hypocrites do in the synagogues and on
the streets, to be applauded by people. I
assure you: They've got their reward!
3 But when you give to the poor, don't
let your le hand know what your right
hand is doing,
4 so that your giving may be in secret.
And your Father who sees in secret will
reward you.
5 "Whenever you pray, you must not be
like the hypocrites, because they love to
pray standing in the synagogues and on
the street corners to be seen by people.
I assure you: They've got their reward!
6 But when you pray, go into your
private room, shut your door, and pray
to your Father who is in secret. And your
Father who sees in secret will reward
you.
7 When you pray, don't babble like the
idolaters, since they imagine they'll be
heard for their many words.MATTHEW 6
25
8 Don't be like them, because your
Father knows the things you need before
you ask Him.
9 "Therefore, you should pray like this:
Our Father in heaven, Your name be
honored as holy.
10 Your kingdom come. Your will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us today our daily bread.
12 And forgive us our debts, as we also
have forgiven our debtors.
13 And do not bring us into tempta on,
but deliver us from the evil one. [For
Yours is the kingdom and the power and
the glory forever. Amen.]
14 "For if you forgive people their
wrongdoing, your heavenly Father will
forgive you as well.
15 But if you don't forgive people, your
Father will not forgive your wrongdoing.
16 "Whenever you fast, don't be
sad-faced like the hypocrites. For theyMATTHEW 6
26
make their faces una rac ve so their
fas ng is obvious to people. I assure you:
They've got their reward!
17 But when you fast, put oil on your
head, and wash your face,
18 so that you don't show your fas ng
to people but to your Father who is in
secret. And your Father who sees in
secret will reward you.
19 "Don't collect for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust
destroy and where thieves break in and
steal.
20 But collect for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
destroys, and where thieves don't break
in and steal.
21 For where your treasure is, there
your heart will be also.
22 "The eye is the lamp of the body. If
your eye is good, your whole body will
be full of light.MATTHEW 6
27
23 But if your eye is bad, your whole
body will be full of darkness. So if the
light within you is darkness--how deep is
that darkness!
24 "No one can be a slave of two
masters, since either he will hate one
and love the other, or be devoted to one
and despise the other. You cannot be
slaves of God and of money.
25 "This is why I tell you: Don't worry
about your life, what you will eat or what
you will drink; or about your body, what
you will wear. Isn't life more than food
and the body more than clothing?
26 Look at the birds of the sky: they
don't sow or reap or gather into barns,
yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Aren't you worth more than they?
27 Can any of you add a single cubit to
his height by worrying?MATTHEW 6
28
28 And why do you worry about clothes?
Learn how the wildﬂowers of the ﬁeld
grow: they don't labor or spin thread.
29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon
in all his splendor was adorned like one
of these!
30 If that's how God clothes the grass of
the ﬁeld, which is here today and thrown
into the furnace tomorrow, won't He do
much more for you--you of li le faith?
31 So don't worry, saying, 'What will we
eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What
will we wear?'
32 For the idolaters eagerly seek all
these things, and your heavenly Father
knows that you need them.
33 But seek ﬁrst the kingdom of God
and His righteousness, and all these
things will be provided for you.
34 Therefore don't worry about
tomorrow, because tomorrow will worryMATTHEW 7
29
about itself. Each day has enough trouble
of its own.
1 "Do not judge, so that you won't be
judged.
2 For with the judgment you use, you
will be judged, and with the measure
you use, it will be measured to you.
3 Why do you look at the speck in your
brother's eye but don't no ce the log in
your own eye?
4 Or how can you say to your brother,
'Let me take the speck out of your eye,'
and look, there's a log in your eye?
5 Hypocrite! First take the log out of
your eye, and then you will see clearly to
take the speck out of your brother's eye.
6 Don't give what is holy to dogs or
toss your pearls before pigs, or they will
trample them with their feet, turn, and
tear you to pieces.
7 "Keep asking, and it will be given to
you. Keep searching, and you will ﬁnd.
7MATTHEW 7
30
Keep knocking, and the door will be
opened to you.
8 For everyone who asks receives, and
the one who searches ﬁnds, and to
the one who knocks, the door will be
opened.
9 What man among you, if his son asks
him for bread, will give him a stone?
10 Or if he asks for a ﬁsh, will give him a
snake?
11 If you then, who are evil, know how
to give good gi s to your children, how
much more will your Father in heaven
give good things to those who ask Him!
12 Therefore, whatever you want others
to do for you, do also the same for
them--this is the Law and the Prophets.
13 "Enter through the narrow gate. For
the gate is wide and the road is broad
that leads to destruc on, and there are
many who go through it.MATTHEW 7
31
14 How narrow is the gate and diﬃcult
the road that leads to life, and few ﬁnd
it.
15 "Beware of false prophets who come
to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly
are ravaging wolves.
16 You'll recognize them by their fruit.
Are grapes gathered from thornbushes
or ﬁgs from thistles?
17 In the same way, every good tree
produces good fruit, but a bad tree
produces bad fruit.
18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit;
neither can a bad tree produce good
fruit.
19 Every tree that doesn't produce good
fruit is cut down and thrown into the
ﬁre.
20 So you'll recognize them by their
fruit.
21 "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord,
Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven,MATTHEW 7
32
but only the one who does the will of
My Father in heaven.
22 On that day many will say to Me,
'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in Your
name, drive out demons in Your name,
and do many miracles in Your name?'
23 Then I will announce to them, 'I
never knew you! Depart from Me, you
lawbreakers! '
24 "Therefore, everyone who hears
these words of Mine and acts on them
will be like a sensible man who built his
house on the rock.
25 The rain fell, the rivers rose, and the
winds blew and pounded that house. Yet
it didn't collapse, because its founda on
was on the rock.
26 But everyone who hears these words
of Mine and doesn't act on them will be
like a foolish man who built his house on
the sand.MATTHEW 7 – 8
33
27 The rain fell, the rivers rose, the
winds blew and pounded that house,
and it collapsed. And its collapse was
great!"
28 When Jesus had ﬁnished this sermon,
the crowds were astonished at His
teaching,
29 because He was teaching them like
one who had authority, and not like their
scribes.
1 When He came down from the
mountain, large crowds followed
Him.
2 Right away a man with a serious skin
disease came up and knelt before Him,
saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can
make me clean."
3 Reaching out His hand He touched
him, saying, "I am willing; be made
clean." Immediately his disease was
healed.
8MATTHEW 8
34
4 Then Jesus told him, "See that you
don't tell anyone; but go, show yourself
to the priest, and oﬀer the gi that
Moses prescribed, as a tes mony to
them."
5 When He entered Capernaum, a
centurion came to Him, pleading with
Him,
6 "Lord, my servant is lying at home
paralyzed, in terrible agony!"
7 "I will come and heal him," He told
him.
8 "Lord," the centurion replied, "I am
not worthy to have You come under
my roof. But only say the word, and my
servant will be cured.
9 For I too am a man under authority,
having soldiers under my command. I
say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to
another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to
my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it."MATTHEW 8
35
10 Hearing this, Jesus was amazed and
said to those following Him, "I assure
you: I have not found anyone in Israel
with so great a faith!
11 I tell you that many will come from
east and west, and recline at the table
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
kingdom of heaven.
12 But the sons of the kingdom will
be thrown into the outer darkness. In
that place there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth."
13 Then Jesus told the centurion, "Go.
As you have believed, let it be done for
you." And his servant was cured that
very moment.
14 When Jesus went into Peter's house,
He saw his mother-in-law lying in bed
with a fever.
15 So He touched her hand, and the
fever le her. Then she got up and began
to serve Him.MATTHEW 8
36
16 When evening came, they brought to
Him many who were demon-possessed.
He drove out the spirits with a word and
healed all who were sick,
17 so that what was spoken through
the prophet Isaiah might be fulﬁlled:
He Himself took our weaknesses and
carried our diseases.
18 When Jesus saw large crowds around
Him, He gave the order to go to the
other side of the sea .
19 A scribe approached Him and said,
"Teacher, I will follow You wherever You
go!"
20 Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens and
birds of the sky have nests, but the Son
of Man has no place to lay His head."
21 "Lord," another of His disciples said,
"ﬁrst let me go bury my father."
22 But Jesus told him, "Follow Me, and
let the dead bury their own dead."MATTHEW 8
37
23 As He got into the boat, His disciples
followed Him.
24 Suddenly, a violent storm arose on
the sea, so that the boat was being
swamped by the waves. But He was
sleeping.
25 So the disciples came and woke Him
up, saying, "Lord, save us ! We're going
to die!"
26 But He said to them, "Why are you
fearful, you of li le faith?" Then He got
up and rebuked the winds and the sea.
And there was a great calm.
27 The men were amazed and asked,
"What kind of man is this?--even the
winds and the sea obey Him!"
28 When He had come to the other side,
to the region of the Gadarenes, two
demon-possessed men met Him as they
came out of the tombs. They were so
violent that no one could pass that way.MATTHEW 8
38
29 Suddenly they shouted, "What do
You have to do with us, Son of God?
Have You come here to torment us
before the me?"
30 Now a long way oﬀ from them, a
large herd of pigs was feeding.
31 "If You drive us out," the demons
begged Him, "send us into the herd of
pigs."
32 "Go!" He told them. So when they
had come out, they entered the pigs.
And suddenly the whole herd rushed
down the steep bank into the sea and
perished in the water.
33 Then the men who tended them
ﬂed. They went into the city and
reported everything--especially what
had happened to those who were
demon-possessed.
34 At that, the whole town went out to
meet Jesus. When they saw Him, they
begged Him to leave their region.MATTHEW 9
9
39
1 So He got into a boat, crossed over,
and came to His own town.
2 Just then some men brought to Him
a paraly c lying on a stretcher. Seeing
their faith, Jesus told the paraly c, "Have
courage, son, your sins are forgiven."
3 At this, some of the scribes said
among themselves, "He's blaspheming!"
4 But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus
said, "Why are you thinking evil things in
your hearts?
5 For which is easier: to say, 'Your sins
are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and
walk'?
6 But so you may know that the Son of
Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins"--then He told the paraly c, "Get
up, pick up your stretcher, and go home."
7 And he got up and went home.
8 When the crowds saw this, they were
awestruck and gave glory to God who
had given such authority to men.MATTHEW 9
40
9 As Jesus went on from there, He saw
a man named Ma hew si ng at the tax
oﬃce, and He said to him, "Follow Me!"
So he got up and followed Him.
10 While He was reclining at the table
in the house, many tax collectors and
sinners came as guests to eat with Jesus
and His disciples.
11 When the Pharisees saw this, they
asked His disciples, "Why does your
Teacher eat with tax collectors and
sinners?"
12 But when He heard this, He said,
"Those who are well don't need a doctor,
but the sick do.
13 Go and learn what this means: I
desire mercy and not sacriﬁce. For I
didn't come to call the righteous, but
sinners."
14 Then John's disciples came to Him,
saying, "Why do we and the PhariseesMATTHEW 9
41
fast o en, but Your disciples do not
fast?"
15 Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding
guests be sad while the groom is with
them? The days will come when the
groom will be taken away from them,
and then they will fast.
16 No one patches an old garment with
unshrunk cloth, because the patch pulls
away from the garment and makes the
tear worse.
17 And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins. Otherwise, the skins burst,
the wine spills out, and the skins are
ruined. But they put new wine into fresh
wineskins, and both are preserved."
18 As He was telling them these things,
suddenly one of the leaders came and
knelt down before Him, saying, "My
daughter is near death, but come and
lay Your hand on her, and she will live."MATTHEW 9
42
19 So Jesus and His disciples got up and
followed him.
20 Just then, a woman who had suﬀered
from bleeding for 12 years approached
from behind and touched the tassel on
His robe,
21 for she said to herself, "If I can just
touch His robe, I'll be made well!"
22 But Jesus turned and saw her. "Have
courage, daughter," He said. "Your faith
has made you well." And the woman
was made well from that moment.
23 When Jesus came to the leader's
house, He saw the ﬂute players and a
crowd lamen ng loudly.
24 "Leave," He said, "because the girl
isn't dead, but sleeping." And they
started laughing at Him.
25 But when the crowd had been put
outside, He went in and took her by the
hand, and the girl got up.MATTHEW 9
43
26 And this news spread throughout
that whole area.
27 As Jesus went on from there, two
blind men followed Him, shou ng, "Have
mercy on us, Son of David!"
28 When He entered the house, the
blind men approached Him, and Jesus
said to them, "Do you believe that I can
do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered
Him.
29 Then He touched their eyes, saying,
"Let it be done for you according to your
faith!"
30 And their eyes were opened. Then
Jesus warned them sternly, "Be sure that
no one ﬁnds out!"
31 But they went out and spread the
news about Him throughout that whole
area.
32 Just as they were going out, a
demon-possessed man who was unable
to speak was brought to Him.MATTHEW 9
44
33 When the demon had been driven
out, the man spoke. And the crowds
were amazed, saying, "Nothing like this
has ever been seen in Israel!"
34 But the Pharisees said, "He drives out
demons by the ruler of the demons!"
35 Then Jesus went to all the towns and
villages, teaching in their synagogues,
preaching the good news of the
kingdom, and healing every disease and
every sickness.
36 When He saw the crowds, He felt
compassion for them, because they
were weary and worn out, like sheep
without a shepherd.
37 Then He said to His disciples, "The
harvest is abundant, but the workers are
few.
38 Therefore, pray to the Lord of the
harvest to send out workers into His
harvest."MATTHEW 10
10
45
1 Summoning His 12 disciples, He
gave them authority over unclean
spirits, to drive them out and to heal
every disease and sickness.
2 These are the names of the 12
apostles: First, Simon, who is called
Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and
Ma hew the tax collector; James the
son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,
who also betrayed Him.
5 Jesus sent out these 12 a er giving
them instruc ons: "Don't take the road
leading to other na ons, and don't enter
any Samaritan town.
6 Instead, go to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.
7 As you go, announce this: 'The
kingdom of heaven has come near.'MATTHEW 10
46
8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
those with skin diseases, drive out
demons. You have received free of
charge; give free of charge.
9 Don't take along gold, silver, or copper
for your money-belts.
10 Don't take a traveling bag for the
road, or an extra shirt, sandals, or a
walking s ck, for the worker is worthy of
his food.
11 "When you enter any town or village,
ﬁnd out who is worthy, and stay there
un l you leave.
12 Greet a household when you enter it,
13 and if the household is worthy, let
your peace be on it. But if it is unworthy,
let your peace return to you.
14 If anyone will not welcome you or
listen to your words, shake the dust oﬀ
your feet when you leave that house or
town.MATTHEW 10
47
15 I assure you: It will be more tolerable
on the day of judgment for the land
of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that
town.
16 "Look, I'm sending you out like sheep
among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd
as serpents and as harmless as doves.
17 Because people will hand you over
to sanhedrins and ﬂog you in their
synagogues, beware of them.
18 You will even be brought before
governors and kings because of Me, to
bear witness to them and to the na ons.
19 But when they hand you over, don't
worry about how or what you should
speak. For you will be given what to say
at that hour,
20 because you are not speaking, but
the Spirit of your Father is speaking
through you.
21 "Brother will betray brother to death,
and a father his child. Children will evenMATTHEW 10
48
rise up against their parents and have
them put to death.
22 You will be hated by everyone
because of My name. But the one who
endures to the end will be delivered.
23 When they persecute you in one
town, escape to another. For I assure
you: You will not have covered the towns
of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
24 A disciple is not above his teacher, or
a slave above his master.
25 It is enough for a disciple to become
like his teacher and a slave like his
master. If they called the head of the
house 'Beelzebul,' how much more the
members of his household!
26 "Therefore, don't be afraid of them,
since there is nothing covered that won't
be uncovered, and nothing hidden that
won't be made known.MATTHEW 10
49
27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in
the light. What you hear in a whisper,
proclaim on the housetops.
28 Don't fear those who kill the body
but are not able to kill the soul; rather,
fear Him who is able to destroy both soul
and body in hell.
29 Aren't two sparrows sold for a
penny? Yet not one of them falls to the
ground without your Father's consent.
30 But even the hairs of your head have
all been counted.
31 Don't be afraid therefore; you are
worth more than many sparrows.
32 "Therefore, everyone who will
acknowledge Me before men, I will also
acknowledge him before My Father in
heaven.
33 But whoever denies Me before men,
I will also deny him before My Father in
heaven.MATTHEW 10
50
34 Don't assume that I came to bring
peace on the earth. I did not come to
bring peace, but a sword.
35 For I came to turn a man against
his father, a daughter against her
mother, a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law;
36 and a man's enemies will be the
members of his household.
37 The person who loves father or
mother more than Me is not worthy
of Me; the person who loves son or
daughter more than Me is not worthy of
Me.
38 And whoever doesn't take up his
cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.
39 Anyone ﬁnding his life will lose it, and
anyone losing his life because of Me will
ﬁnd it.
40 "The one who welcomes you
welcomes Me, and the one whoMATTHEW 10 – 11
51
welcomes Me welcomes Him who sent
Me.
41 Anyone who welcomes a prophet
because he is a prophet will receive
a prophet's reward. And anyone who
welcomes a righteous person because
he's righteous will receive a righteous
person's reward.
42 And whoever gives just a cup of cold
water to one of these li le ones because
he is a disciple--I assure you: He will
never lose his reward!"
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished giving
orders to His 12 disciples, He
moved on from there to teach and
preach in their towns.
2 When John heard in prison what the
Messiah was doing, he sent a message
by his disciples
3 and asked Him, "Are You the One
who is to come, or should we expect
someone else?"
11MATTHEW 11
52
4 Jesus replied to them, "Go and report
to John what you hear and see:
5 the blind see, the lame walk, those
with skin diseases are healed, the deaf
hear, the dead are raised, and the poor
are told the good news.
6 And if anyone is not oﬀended because
of Me, he is blessed."
7 As these men went away, Jesus began
to speak to the crowds about John:
"What did you go out into the wilderness
to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
8 What then did you go out to see?
A man dressed in so clothes? Look,
those who wear so clothes are in kings'
palaces.
9 But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more
than a prophet.
10 This is the one it is wri en about:
Look, I am sending My messenger aheadMATTHEW 11
53
of You; he will prepare Your way before
You.
11 "I assure you: Among those born of
women no one greater than John the
Bap st has appeared, but the least in
the kingdom of heaven is greater than
he.
12 From the days of John the Bap st
un l now, the kingdom of heaven has
been suﬀering violence, and the violent
have been seizing it by force.
13 For all the prophets and the law
prophesied un l John;
14 if you're willing to accept it, he is the
Elijah who is to come.
15 Anyone who has ears should listen!
16 "To what should I compare this
genera on? It's like children si ng in
the marketplaces who call out to each
other:MATTHEW 11
54
17 We played the ﬂute for you, but you
didn't dance; we sang a lament, but you
didn't mourn!
18 For John did not come ea ng or
drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!'
19 The Son of Man came ea ng and
drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glu on
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by
her deeds."
20 Then He proceeded to denounce the
towns where most of His miracles were
done, because they did not repent:
21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were
done in you had been done in Tyre and
Sidon, they would have repented in
sackcloth and ashes long ago!
22 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon on the day of
judgment than for you.MATTHEW 11
55
23 And you, Capernaum, will you be
exalted to heaven? You will go down
to Hades. For if the miracles that were
done in you had been done in Sodom, it
would have remained un l today.
24 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable
for the land of Sodom on the day of
judgment than for you."
25 At that me Jesus said, "I praise
You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because You have hidden these things
from the wise and learned and revealed
them to infants.
26 Yes, Father, because this was Your
good pleasure.
27 All things have been entrusted to Me
by My Father. No one knows the Son
except the Father, and no one knows
the Father except the Son and anyone to
whom the Son desires to reveal Him.MATTHEW 11 – 12
56
28 "Come to Me, all of you who are
weary and burdened, and I will give you
rest.
29 All of you, take up My yoke and
learn from Me, because I am gentle and
humble in heart, and you will ﬁnd rest
for yourselves.
30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is
light."
1 At that me Jesus passed
through the grainﬁelds on the
Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and
began to pick and eat some heads of
grain.
2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they
said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are
doing what is not lawful to do on the
Sabbath!"
3 He said to them, "Haven't you read
what David did when he and those who
were with him were hungry--
12MATTHEW 12
57
4 how he entered the house of God,
and they ate the sacred bread, which is
not lawful for him or for those with him
to eat, but only for the priests?
5 Or haven't you read in the Law that on
Sabbath days the priests in the temple
violate the Sabbath and are innocent?
6 But I tell you that something greater
than the temple is here!
7 If you had known what this means:
I desire mercy and not sacriﬁce ,
you would not have condemned the
innocent.
8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath."
9 Moving on from there, He entered
their synagogue.
10 There He saw a man who had a
paralyzed hand. And in order to accuse
Him they asked Him, "Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath?"MATTHEW 12
58
11 But He said to them, "What man
among you, if he had a sheep that fell
into a pit on the Sabbath, wouldn't take
hold of it and li it out?
12 A man is worth far more than a
sheep, so it is lawful to do good on the
Sabbath."
13 Then He told the man, "Stretch out
your hand." So he stretched it out, and it
was restored, as good as the other.
14 But the Pharisees went out and
plo ed against Him, how they might
destroy Him.
15 When Jesus became aware of this,
He withdrew from there. Huge crowds
followed Him, and He healed them all.
16 He warned them not to make Him
known,
17 so that what was spoken through the
prophet Isaiah might be fulﬁlled:
18 Here is My Servant whom I have
chosen, My beloved in whom My soulMATTHEW 12
59
delights; I will put My Spirit on Him, and
He will proclaim jus ce to the na ons.
19 He will not argue or shout, and no
one will hear His voice in the streets.
20 He will not break a bruised reed, and
He will not put out a smoldering wick,
un l He has led jus ce to victory.
21 The na ons will put their hope in His
name.
22 Then a demon-possessed man who
was blind and unable to speak was
brought to Him. He healed him, so that
the man could both speak and see.
23 And all the crowds were astounded
and said, "Perhaps this is the Son of
David!"
24 When the Pharisees heard this, they
said, "The man drives out demons only
by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
25 Knowing their thoughts, He told
them: "Every kingdom divided against
itself is headed for destruc on, and noMATTHEW 12
60
city or house divided against itself will
stand.
26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is
divided against himself. How then will
his kingdom stand?
27 And if I drive out demons by
Beelzebul, who is it your sons drive them
out by? For this reason they will be your
judges.
28 If I drive out demons by the Spirit of
God, then the kingdom of God has come
to you.
29 How can someone enter a strong
man's house and steal his possessions
unless he ﬁrst es up the strong man?
Then he can rob his house.
30 Anyone who is not with Me is against
Me, and anyone who does not gather
with Me sca ers.
31 Because of this, I tell you, people will
be forgiven every sin and blasphemy, butMATTHEW 12
61
the blasphemy against the Spirit will not
be forgiven.
32 Whoever speaks a word against the
Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But
whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit,
it will not be forgiven him, either in this
age or in the one to come.
33 "Either make the tree good and its
fruit good, or make the tree bad and its
fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
34 Brood of vipers! How can you speak
good things when you are evil? For the
mouth speaks from the overﬂow of the
heart.
35 A good man produces good things
from his storeroom of good, and an
evil man produces evil things from his
storeroom of evil.
36 I tell you that on the day of judgment
people will have to account for every
careless word they speak.MATTHEW 12
62
37 For by your words you will be
acqui ed, and by your words you will be
condemned."
38 Then some of the scribes and
Pharisees said to Him, "Teacher, we want
to see a sign from You."
39 But He answered them, "An evil and
adulterous genera on demands a sign,
but no sign will be given to it except the
sign of the prophet Jonah.
40 For as Jonah was in the belly of the
great ﬁsh three days and three nights,
so the Son of Man will be in the heart of
the earth three days and three nights.
41 The men of Nineveh will stand up
at the judgment with this genera on
and condemn it, because they repented
at Jonah's proclama on; and look-
-something greater than Jonah is
here!
42 The queen of the south will rise up at
the judgment with this genera on andMATTHEW 12
63
condemn it, because she came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of
Solomon; and look--something greater
than Solomon is here!
43 "When an unclean spirit comes out
of a man, it roams through waterless
places looking for rest but doesn't ﬁnd
any.
44 Then it says, 'I'll go back to my house
that I came from.' And when it arrives, it
ﬁnds the house vacant, swept, and put
in order.
45 Then oﬀ it goes and brings with it
seven other spirits more evil than itself,
and they enter and se le down there.
As a result, that man's last condi on is
worse than the ﬁrst. That's how it will
also be with this evil genera on."
46 He was s ll speaking to the crowds
when suddenly His mother and brothers
were standing outside wan ng to speak
to Him.MATTHEW 12 – 13
64
47 Someone told Him, "Look, Your
mother and Your brothers are standing
outside, wan ng to speak to You."
48 But He replied to the one who told
Him, "Who is My mother and who are
My brothers?"
49 And stretching out His hand toward
His disciples, He said, "Here are My
mother and My brothers!
50 For whoever does the will of My
Father in heaven, that person is My
brother and sister and mother."
1 On that day Jesus went out of
the house and was si ng by the
sea.
2 Such large crowds gathered around
Him that He got into a boat and sat
down, while the whole crowd stood on
the shore.
3 Then He told them many things in
parables, saying: "Consider the sower
who went out to sow.
13MATTHEW 13
65
4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell
along the path, and the birds came and
ate them up.
5 Others fell on rocky ground, where
there wasn't much soil, and they sprang
up quickly since the soil wasn't deep.
6 But when the sun came up they were
scorched, and since they had no root,
they withered.
7 Others fell among thorns, and the
thorns came up and choked them.
8 S ll others fell on good ground, and
produced a crop: some 100, some 60,
and some 30 mes what was sown .
9 Anyone who has ears should listen!"
10 Then the disciples came up and
asked Him, "Why do You speak to them
in parables?"
11 He answered them, "Because the
secrets of the kingdom of heaven have
been given for you to know, but it has
not been given to them.MATTHEW 13
66
12 For whoever has, more will be given
to him, and he will have more than
enough. But whoever does not have,
even what he has will be taken away
from him.
13 For this reason I speak to them in
parables, because looking they do not
see, and hearing they do not listen or
understand.
14 Isaiah's prophecy is fulﬁlled in them,
which says: You will listen and listen, yet
never understand; and you will look and
look, yet never perceive.
15 For this people's heart has grown
callous; their ears are hard of hearing,
and they have shut their eyes; otherwise
they might see with their eyes and hear
with their ears, understand with their
hearts and turn back--and I would cure
them.MATTHEW 13
67
16 "But your eyes are blessed because
they do see, and your ears because they
do hear!
17 For I assure you: Many prophets
and righteous people longed to see the
things you see yet didn't see them; to
hear the things you hear yet didn't hear
them.
18 "You, then, listen to the parable of
the sower:
19 When anyone hears the word about
the kingdom and doesn't understand it,
the evil one comes and snatches away
what was sown in his heart. This is the
one sown along the path.
20 And the one sown on rocky ground-
-this is one who hears the word and
immediately receives it with joy.
21 Yet he has no root in himself,
but is short-lived. When pressure or
persecu on comes because of the word,
immediately he stumbles.MATTHEW 13
68
22 Now the one sown among the
thorns--this is one who hears the word,
but the worries of this age and the
seduc on of wealth choke the word, and
it becomes unfrui ul.
23 But the one sown on the good
ground--this is one who hears and
understands the word, who does bear
fruit and yields: some 100, some 60,
some 30 mes what was sown ."
24 He presented another parable to
them: "The kingdom of heaven may be
compared to a man who sowed good
seed in his ﬁeld.
25 But while people were sleeping, his
enemy came, sowed weeds among the
wheat, and le .
26 When the plants sprouted and
produced grain, then the weeds also
appeared.
27 The landowner's slaves came to him
and said, 'Master, didn't you sow goodMATTHEW 13
69
seed in your ﬁeld? Then where did the
weeds come from?'
28 "'An enemy did this!' he told them.
"'So, do you want us to go and gather
them up?' the slaves asked him.
29 "'No,' he said. 'When you gather up
the weeds, you might also uproot the
wheat with them.
30 Let both grow together un l the
harvest. At harvest me I'll tell the
reapers: Gather the weeds ﬁrst and e
them in bundles to burn them, but store
the wheat in my barn. '"
31 He presented another parable to
them: "The kingdom of heaven is like
a mustard seed that a man took and
sowed in his ﬁeld.
32 It's the smallest of all the seeds,
but when grown, it's taller than the
vegetables and becomes a tree, so that
the birds of the sky come and nest in its
branches."MATTHEW 13
70
33 He told them another parable: "The
kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a
woman took and mixed into 50 pounds
of ﬂour un l it spread through all of it."
34 Jesus told the crowds all these things
in parables, and He would not speak
anything to them without a parable,
35 so that what was spoken through the
prophet might be fulﬁlled: I will open My
mouth in parables; I will declare things
kept secret from the founda on of the
world.
36 Then He dismissed the crowds
and went into the house. His disciples
approached Him and said, "Explain the
parable of the weeds in the ﬁeld to us."
37 He replied: "The One who sows the
good seed is the Son of Man;
38 the ﬁeld is the world; and the good
seed--these are the sons of the kingdom.
The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
andMATTHEW 13

39 the enemy who sowed them is the
Devil. The harvest is the end of the age,
and the harvesters are angels.
40 Therefore just as the weeds are
gathered and burned in the ﬁre, so it will
be at the end of the age.
41 The Son of Man will send out His
angels, and they will gather from His
kingdom everything that causes sin and
those guilty of lawlessness.
42 They will throw them into the blazing
furnace where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.
43 Then the righteous will shine like the
sun in their Father's kingdom. Anyone
who has ears should listen!
44 "The kingdom of heaven is like
treasure, buried in a ﬁeld, that a man
found and reburied. Then in his joy he
goes and sells everything he has and
buys that ﬁeld.MATTHEW 13
72
45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
a merchant in search of ﬁne pearls.
46 When he found one priceless pearl,
he went and sold everything he had, and
bought it.
47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is
like a large net thrown into the sea. It
collected every kind of ﬁsh ,
48 and when it was full, they dragged
it ashore, sat down, and gathered the
good ﬁsh into containers, but threw out
the worthless ones.
49 So it will be at the end of the age.
The angels will go out, separate the evil
people from the righteous,
50 and throw them into the blazing
furnace. In that place there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.
51 "Have you understood all these
things?" "Yes," they told Him.
52 "Therefore," He said to them, "every
student of Scripture instructed in theMATTHEW 13
73
kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
who brings out of his storeroom what is
new and what is old."
53 When Jesus had ﬁnished these
parables, He le there.
54 He went to His hometown and began
to teach them in their synagogue, so that
they were astonished and said, "How did
this wisdom and these miracles come to
Him?
55 Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't
His mother called Mary, and His brothers
James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
56 And His sisters, aren't they all with
us? So where does He get all these
things?"
57 And they were oﬀended by Him. But
Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not
without honor except in his hometown
and in his household."
58 And He did not do many miracles
there because of their unbelief.MATTHEW 14
1 At that
74
me Herod the tetrarch
heard the report about Jesus.
2 "This is John the Bap st!" he told
his servants. "He has been raised from
the dead, and that's why supernatural
powers are at work in him."
3 For Herod had arrested John, chained
him, and put him in prison on account of
Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
4 since John had been telling him, "It's
not lawful for you to have her!"
5 Though he wanted to kill him, he
feared the crowd, since they regarded
him as a prophet.
6 But when Herod's birthday celebra on
came, Herodias' daughter danced before
them and pleased Herod.
7 So he promised with an oath to give
her whatever she might ask.
8 And prompted by her mother, she
answered, "Give me John the Bap st's
head here on a pla er!"
14MATTHEW 14
9 Although the king regre
75
ed it, he
commanded that it be granted because
of his oaths and his guests.
10 So he sent orders and had John
beheaded in the prison.
11 His head was brought on a pla er
and given to the girl, who carried it to
her mother.
12 Then his disciples came, removed the
corpse, buried it, and went and reported
to Jesus.
13 When Jesus heard about it, He
withdrew from there by boat to a
remote place to be alone. When the
crowds heard this, they followed Him on
foot from the towns.
14 As He stepped ashore, He saw a huge
crowd, felt compassion for them, and
healed their sick.
15 When evening came, the disciples
approached Him and said, "This place is
a wilderness, and it is already late. SendMATTHEW 14
76
the crowds away so they can go into the
villages and buy food for themselves."
16 "They don't need to go away," Jesus
told them. "You give them something to
eat."
17 "But we only have ﬁve loaves and
two ﬁsh here," they said to Him.
18 "Bring them here to Me," He said.
19 Then He commanded the crowds to
sit down on the grass. He took the ﬁve
loaves and the two ﬁsh, and looking
up to heaven, He blessed them. He
broke the loaves and gave them to the
disciples, and the disciples gave them to
the crowds.
20 Everyone ate and was ﬁlled. Then
they picked up 12 baskets full of le over
pieces!
21 Now those who ate were about 5,000
men, besides women and children.
22 Immediately He made the disciples
get into the boat and go ahead of Him toMATTHEW 14
77
the other side, while He dismissed the
crowds.
23 A er dismissing the crowds, He
went up on the mountain by Himself to
pray. When evening came, He was there
alone.
24 But the boat was already over a
mile from land, ba ered by the waves,
because the wind was against them.
25 Around three in the morning, He
came toward them walking on the sea.
26 When the disciples saw Him walking
on the sea, they were terriﬁed. "It's a
ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
27 Immediately Jesus spoke to them.
"Have courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
28 "Lord, if it's You," Peter answered
Him, "command me to come to You on
the water."
29 "Come!" He said. And climbing out of
the boat, Peter started walking on the
water and came toward Jesus.MATTHEW 14
78
30 But when he saw the strength of the
wind, he was afraid. And beginning to
sink he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
31 Immediately Jesus reached out His
hand, caught hold of him, and said to
him, "You of li le faith, why did you
doubt?"
32 When they got into the boat, the
wind ceased.
33 Then those in the boat worshiped
Him and said, "Truly You are the Son of
God!"
34 Once they crossed over, they came to
land at Gennesaret.
35 When the men of that place
recognized Him, they alerted the whole
vicinity and brought to Him all who were
sick.
36 They were begging Him that they
might only touch the tassel on His robe.
And as many as touched it were made
perfectly well.MATTHEW 15
15
79
1 Then Pharisees and scribes
came from Jerusalem to Jesus
and asked,
2 "Why do Your disciples break the
tradi on of the elders? For they don't
wash their hands when they eat!"
3 He answered them, "And why do you
break God's commandment because of
your tradi on?
4 For God said: Honor your father and
your mother; and, The one who speaks
evil of father or mother must be put to
death.
5 But you say, 'Whoever tells his father
or mother, "Whatever beneﬁt you
might have received from me is a gi
commi ed to the temple "--
6 he does not have to honor his father.'
In this way, you have revoked God's word
because of your tradi on.
7 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied
correctly about you when he said:MATTHEW 15
80
8 These people honor Me with their
lips, but their heart is far from Me.
9 They worship Me in vain, teaching as
doctrines the commands of men. "
10 Summoning the crowd, He told them,
"Listen and understand:
11 It's not what goes into the mouth
that deﬁles a man, but what comes out
of the mouth, this deﬁles a man."
12 Then the disciples came up and told
Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees
took oﬀense when they heard this
statement?"
13 He replied, "Every plant that My
heavenly Father didn't plant will be
uprooted.
14 Leave them alone! They are blind
guides. And if the blind guide the blind,
both will fall into a pit."
15 Then Peter replied to Him, "Explain
this parable to us."MATTHEW 15
16 "Are even you s
81
ll lacking in
understanding?" He asked.
17 "Don't you realize that whatever goes
into the mouth passes into the stomach
and is eliminated?
18 But what comes out of the mouth
comes from the heart, and this deﬁles a
man.
19 For from the heart come evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual
immorali es, the s, false tes monies,
blasphemies.
20 These are the things that deﬁle a
man, but ea ng with unwashed hands
does not deﬁle a man."
21 When Jesus le there, He withdrew
to the area of Tyre and Sidon.
22 Just then a Canaanite woman from
that region came and kept crying out,
"Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!
My daughter is cruelly tormented by a
demon."MATTHEW 15
82
23 Yet He did not say a word to her. So
His disciples approached Him and urged
Him, "Send her away because she cries
out a er us."
24 He replied, "I was sent only to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel."
25 But she came, knelt before Him, and
said, "Lord, help me!"
26 He answered, "It isn't right to take
the children's bread and throw it to their
dogs."
27 "Yes, Lord," she said, "yet even the
dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their
masters' table!"
28 Then Jesus replied to her, "Woman,
your faith is great. Let it be done for you
as you want." And from that moment
her daughter was cured.
29 Moving on from there, Jesus passed
along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on
a mountain and sat there,MATTHEW 15
83
30 and large crowds came to Him,
having with them the lame, the blind,
the deformed, those unable to speak,
and many others. They put them at His
feet, and He healed them.
31 So the crowd was amazed when they
saw those unable to speak talking, the
deformed restored, the lame walking,
and the blind seeing. And they gave
glory to the God of Israel.
32 Now Jesus summoned His disciples
and said, "I have compassion on the
crowd, because they've already stayed
with Me three days and have nothing
to eat. I don't want to send them away
hungry; otherwise they might collapse
on the way."
33 The disciples said to Him, "Where
could we get enough bread in this
desolate place to ﬁll such a crowd?"MATTHEW 15 – 16
84
34 "How many loaves do you have?"
Jesus asked them. "Seven," they said,
"and a few small ﬁsh."
35 A er commanding the crowd to sit
down on the ground,
36 He took the seven loaves and the ﬁsh,
and He gave thanks, broke them, and
kept on giving them to the disciples, and
the disciples gave them to the crowds.
37 They all ate and were ﬁlled. Then
they collected the le over pieces--seven
large baskets full.
38 Now those who ate were 4,000 men,
besides women and children.
39 A er dismissing the crowds, He got
into the boat and went to the region of
Magadan.
1 The Pharisees and Sadducees
approached, and as a test, asked
Him to show them a sign from heaven.
16MATTHEW 16
85
2 He answered them: "When evening
comes you say, 'It will be good weather
because the sky is red.'
3 And in the morning, 'Today will be
stormy because the sky is red and
threatening.' You know how to read the
appearance of the sky, but you can't
read the signs of the mes.
4 An evil and adulterous genera on
wants a sign, but no sign will be given to
it except the sign of Jonah." Then He le
them and went away.
5 The disciples reached the other shore,
and they had forgo en to take bread.
6 Then Jesus told them, "Watch out and
beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees."
7 And they discussed among
themselves, "We didn't bring any
bread."MATTHEW 16
8 Aware of this, Jesus said, "You of li
86
le
faith! Why are you discussing among
yourselves that you do not have bread?
9 Don't you understand yet? Don't you
remember the ﬁve loaves for the 5,000
and how many baskets you collected?
10 Or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and
how many large baskets you collected?
11 Why is it you don't understand that
when I told you, 'Beware of the yeast of
the Pharisees and Sadducees,' it wasn't
about bread?"
12 Then they understood that He did
not tell them to beware of the yeast
in bread, but of the teaching of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.
13 When Jesus came to the region of
Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples,
"Who do people say that the Son of Man
is?"MATTHEW 16
87
14 And they said, "Some say John
the Bap st; others, Elijah; s ll others,
Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
15 "But you," He asked them, "who do
you say that I am?"
16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the
Messiah, the Son of the living God!"
17 And Jesus responded, "Simon son
of Jonah, you are blessed because ﬂesh
and blood did not reveal this to you, but
My Father in heaven.
18 And I also say to you that you are
Peter, and on this rock I will build My
church, and the forces of Hades will not
overpower it.
19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, and whatever you bind on
earth is already bound in heaven, and
whatever you loose on earth is already
loosed in heaven."
20 And He gave the disciples orders to
tell no one that He was the Messiah.MATTHEW 16
88
21 From then on Jesus began to point
out to His disciples that He must go to
Jerusalem and suﬀer many things from
the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be
killed, and be raised the third day.
22 Then Peter took Him aside and began
to rebuke Him, "Oh no, Lord! This will
never happen to You!"
23 But He turned and told Peter, "Get
behind Me, Satan! You are an oﬀense to
Me because you're not thinking about
God's concerns, but man's."
24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If
anyone wants to come with Me, he must
deny himself, take up his cross, and
follow Me.
25 For whoever wants to save his life
will lose it, but whoever loses his life
because of Me will ﬁnd it.
26 What will it beneﬁt a man if he gains
the whole world yet loses his life? OrMATTHEW 16 – 17
89
what will a man give in exchange for his
life?
27 For the Son of Man is going to come
with His angels in the glory of His Father,
and then He will reward each according
to what he has done.
28 I assure you: There are some standing
here who will not taste death un l they
see the Son of Man coming in His
kingdom."
1 A er six days Jesus took Peter,
James, and his brother John, and
led them up on a high mountain by
themselves.
2 He was transformed in front of them,
and His face shone like the sun. Even His
clothes became as white as the light.
3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared
to them, talking with Him.
4 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it's
good for us to be here! If You want, I will
17MATTHEW 17
90
make three tabernacles here: one for
You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
5 While he was s ll speaking, suddenly
a bright cloud covered them, and a voice
from the cloud said: This is My beloved
Son. I take delight in Him. Listen to Him!
6 When the disciples heard it, they fell
facedown and were terriﬁed.
7 Then Jesus came up, touched them,
and said, "Get up; don't be afraid."
8 When they looked up they saw no one
except Him--Jesus alone.
9 As they were coming down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them,
"Don't tell anyone about the vision un l
the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
10 So the disciples ques oned Him,
"Why then do the scribes say that Elijah
must come ﬁrst?"
11 "Elijah is coming and will restore
everything," He replied.MATTHEW 17
91
12 "But I tell you: Elijah has already
come, and they didn't recognize him.
On the contrary, they did whatever they
pleased to him. In the same way the Son
of Man is going to suﬀer at their hands."
13 Then the disciples understood that
He spoke to them about John the
Bap st.
14 When they reached the crowd, a
man approached and knelt down before
Him.
15 "Lord," he said, "have mercy on my
son, because he has seizures and suﬀers
severely. He o en falls into the ﬁre and
o en into the water.
16 I brought him to Your disciples, but
they couldn't heal him."
17 Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and
rebellious genera on! How long will I be
with you? How long must I put up with
you? Bring him here to Me."MATTHEW 17
92
18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon,
and it came out of him, and from that
moment the boy was healed.
19 Then the disciples approached Jesus
privately and said, "Why couldn't we
drive it out?"
20 "Because of your li le faith," He told
them. "For I assure you: If you have
faith the size of a mustard seed, you will
tell this mountain, 'Move from here to
there,' and it will move. Nothing will be
impossible for you.
21 [However, this kind does not come
out except by prayer and fas ng.]"
22 As they were mee ng in Galilee,
Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is
about to be betrayed into the hands of
men.
23 They will kill Him, and on the third
day He will be raised up." And they were
deeply distressed.MATTHEW 17 – 18
93
24 When they came to Capernaum,
those who collected the double-drachma
tax approached Peter and said, "Doesn't
your Teacher pay the double-drachma
tax?"
25 "Yes," he said. When he went into the
house, Jesus spoke to him ﬁrst, "What
do you think, Simon? Who do earthly
kings collect tariﬀs or taxes from? From
their sons or from strangers?"
26 "From strangers," he said. "Then the
sons are free," Jesus told him.
27 "But, so we won't oﬀend them, go to
the sea, cast in a ﬁshhook, and catch the
ﬁrst ﬁsh that comes up. When you open
its mouth you'll ﬁnd a coin. Take it and
give it to them for Me and you."
1 At that me the disciples
came to Jesus and said, "Who is
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
2 Then He called a child to Him and had
him stand among them.
18MATTHEW 18
94
3 "I assure you," He said, "unless you
are converted and become like children,
you will never enter the kingdom of
heaven.
4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself
like this child--this one is the greatest in
the kingdom of heaven.
5 And whoever welcomes one child like
this in My name welcomes Me.
6 "But whoever causes the downfall of
one of these li le ones who believe in
Me--it would be be er for him if a heavy
millstone were hung around his neck
and he were drowned in the depths of
the sea!
7 Woe to the world because of oﬀenses.
For oﬀenses must come, but woe to that
man by whom the oﬀense comes.
8 If your hand or your foot causes your
downfall, cut it oﬀ and throw it away.
It is be er for you to enter life maimedMATTHEW 18
95
or lame, than to have two hands or two
feet and be thrown into the eternal ﬁre.
9 And if your eye causes your downfall,
gouge it out and throw it away. It is
be er for you to enter life with one eye,
rather than to have two eyes and be
thrown into hellﬁre!
10 "See that you don't look down on one
of these li le ones, because I tell you
that in heaven their angels con nually
view the face of My Father in heaven.
11 [For the Son of Man has come to save
the lost.]
12 What do you think? If a man has 100
sheep, and one of them goes astray,
won't he leave the 99 on the hillside and
go and search for the stray?
13 And if he ﬁnds it, I assure you: He
rejoices over that sheep more than over
the 99 that did not go astray.MATTHEW 18
96
14 In the same way, it is not the will of
your Father in heaven that one of these
li le ones perish.
15 "If your brother sins against you, go
and rebuke him in private. If he listens to
you, you have won your brother.
16 But if he won't listen, take one or two
more with you, so that by the tes mony
of two or three witnesses every fact may
be established.
17 If he pays no a en on to them,
tell the church. But if he doesn't pay
a en on even to the church, let him be
like an unbeliever and a tax collector to
you.
18 I assure you: Whatever you bind on
earth is already bound in heaven, and
whatever you loose on earth is already
loosed in heaven.
19 Again, I assure you: If two of you on
earth agree about any ma er that youMATTHEW 18
97
pray for, it will be done for you by My
Father in heaven.
20 For where two or three are gathered
together in My name, I am there among
them."
21 Then Peter came to Him and said,
"Lord, how many mes could my brother
sin against me and I forgive him? As
many as seven mes?"
22 "I tell you, not as many as seven,"
Jesus said to him, "but 70 mes seven.
23 For this reason, the kingdom of
heaven can be compared to a king
who wanted to se le accounts with his
slaves.
24 When he began to se le accounts,
one who owed 10,000 talents was
brought before him.
25 Since he had no way to pay it back,
his master commanded that he, his wife,
his children, and everything he had be
sold to pay the debt.MATTHEW 18
98
26 "At this, the slave fell facedown
before him and said, 'Be pa ent with
me, and I will pay you everything!'
27 Then the master of that slave had
compassion, released him, and forgave
him the loan.
28 "But that slave went out and found
one of his fellow slaves who owed him
100 denarii. He grabbed him, started
choking him, and said, 'Pay what you
owe!'
29 "At this, his fellow slave fell down
and began begging him, 'Be pa ent with
me, and I will pay you back.'
30 But he wasn't willing. On the
contrary, he went and threw him into
prison un l he could pay what was
owed.
31 When the other slaves saw what had
taken place, they were deeply distressed
and went and reported to their master
everything that had happened.MATTHEW 18 – 19
32 "Then, a
99
er he had summoned him,
his master said to him, 'You wicked slave!
I forgave you all that debt because you
begged me.
33 Shouldn't you also have had mercy
on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on
you?'
34 And his master got angry and handed
him over to the jailers un l he could pay
everything that was owed.
35 So My heavenly Father will also do to
you if each of you does not forgive his
brother from his heart."
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished this
instruc on, He departed from
Galilee and went to the region of Judea
across the Jordan.
2 Large crowds followed Him, and He
healed them there.
3 Some Pharisees approached Him to
test Him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a
man to divorce his wife on any grounds?"
19MATTHEW 19
100
4 "Haven't you read," He replied, "that
He who created them in the beginning
made them male and female ,
5 and He also said: For this reason a
man will leave his father and mother and
be joined to his wife, and the two will
become one ﬂesh ?
6 So they are no longer two, but one
ﬂesh. Therefore what God has joined
together, man must not separate."
7 "Why then," they asked Him, "did
Moses command us to give divorce
papers and to send her away?"
8 He told them, "Moses permi ed you
to divorce your wives because of the
hardness of your hearts. But it was not
like that from the beginning.
9 And I tell you, whoever divorces his
wife, except for sexual immorality, and
marries another, commits adultery."MATTHEW 19
101
10 His disciples said to Him, "If the
rela onship of a man with his wife is like
this, it's be er not to marry!"
11 But He told them, "Not everyone can
accept this saying, but only those it has
been given to.
12 For there are eunuchs who were born
that way from their mother's womb,
there are eunuchs who were made by
men, and there are eunuchs who have
made themselves that way because
of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone
accept this who can."
13 Then children were brought to Him
so He might put His hands on them and
pray. But the disciples rebuked them.
14 Then Jesus said, "Leave the children
alone, and don't try to keep them from
coming to Me, because the kingdom of
heaven is made up of people like this."
15 A er pu ng His hands on them, He
went on from there.MATTHEW 19
102
16 Just then someone came up and
asked Him, "Teacher, what good must I
do to have eternal life?"
17 "Why do you ask Me about what is
good?" He said to him. "There is only
One who is good. If you want to enter
into life, keep the commandments."
18 "Which ones?" he asked Him. Jesus
answered, Do not murder; do not
commit adultery; do not steal; do not
bear false witness;
19 honor your father and your mother;
and love your neighbor as yourself.
20 "I have kept all these," the young
man told Him. "What do I s ll lack?"
21 "If you want to be perfect," Jesus said
to him, "go, sell your belongings and give
to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven. Then come, follow Me."
22 When the young man heard that
command, he went away grieving,
because he had many possessions.MATTHEW 19
103
23 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "I
assure you: It will be hard for a rich
person to enter the kingdom of heaven!
24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
God."
25 When the disciples heard this, they
were u erly astonished and asked,
"Then who can be saved?"
26 But Jesus looked at them and said,
"With men this is impossible, but with
God all things are possible."
27 Then Peter responded to Him, "Look,
we have le everything and followed
You. So what will there be for us?"
28 Jesus said to them, "I assure you: In
the Messianic Age, when the Son of Man
sits on His glorious throne, you who have
followed Me will also sit on 12 thrones,
judging the 12 tribes of Israel.MATTHEW 19 – 20
29 And everyone who has le
104
houses,
brothers or sisters, father or mother,
children, or ﬁelds because of My name
will receive 100 mes more and will
inherit eternal life.
30 But many who are ﬁrst will be last,
and the last ﬁrst.
1 "For the kingdom of heaven is
like a landowner who went out
early in the morning to hire workers for
his vineyard.
2 A er agreeing with the workers on
one denarius for the day, he sent them
into his vineyard.
3 When he went out about nine in the
morning, he saw others standing in the
marketplace doing nothing.
4 To those men he said, 'You also go to
my vineyard, and I'll give you whatever
is right.' So oﬀ they went.
5 About noon and at three, he went out
again and did the same thing.
20MATTHEW 20
105
6 Then about ﬁve he went and found
others standing around, and said to
them, 'Why have you been standing here
all day doing nothing?'
7 "'Because no one hired us,' they said
to him. "'You also go to my vineyard,' he
told them.
8 When evening came, the owner of
the vineyard told his foreman, 'Call the
workers and give them their pay, star ng
with the last and ending with the ﬁrst.'
9 "When those who were hired about
ﬁve came, they each received one
denarius.
10 So when the ﬁrst ones came, they
assumed they would get more, but they
also received a denarius each.
11 When they received it, they began to
complain to the landowner:
12 'These last men put in one hour, and
you made them equal to us who boreMATTHEW 20
106
the burden of the day and the burning
heat!'
13 "He replied to one of them, 'Friend,
I'm doing you no wrong. Didn't you
agree with me on a denarius?
14 Take what's yours and go. I want to
give this last man the same as I gave you.
15 Don't I have the right to do what I
want with my business? Are you jealous
because I'm generous?'
16 "So the last will be ﬁrst, and the ﬁrst
last."
17 While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus
took the 12 disciples aside privately and
said to them on the way:
18 "Listen! We are going up to
Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be
handed over to the chief priests and
scribes, and they will condemn Him to
death.
19 Then they will hand Him over to the
Gen les to be mocked, ﬂogged, andMATTHEW 20
107
cruciﬁed, and He will be resurrected on
the third day."
20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons
approached Him with her sons. She knelt
down to ask Him for something.
21 "What do you want?" He asked her.
"Promise," she said to Him, "that these
two sons of mine may sit, one on Your
right and the other on Your le , in Your
kingdom."
22 But Jesus answered, "You don't know
what you're asking. Are you able to drink
the cup that I am about to drink?" "We
are able," they said to Him.
23 He told them, "You will indeed drink
My cup. But to sit at My right and le is
not Mine to give; instead, it belongs to
those for whom it has been prepared by
My Father."
24 When the 10 disciples heard this,
they became indignant with the two
brothers.MATTHEW 20
108
25 But Jesus called them over and said,
"You know that the rulers of the Gen les
dominate them, and the men of high
posi on exercise power over them.
26 It must not be like that among you.
On the contrary, whoever wants to
become great among you must be your
servant,
27 and whoever wants to be ﬁrst among
you must be your slave;
28 just as the Son of Man did not come
to be served, but to serve, and to give
His life--a ransom for many."
29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large
crowd followed Him.
30 There were two blind men si ng by
the road. When they heard that Jesus
was passing by, they cried out, "Lord,
have mercy on us, Son of David!"
31 The crowd told them to keep quiet,
but they cried out all the more, "Lord,
have mercy on us, Son of David!"MATTHEW 20 – 21
109
32 Jesus stopped, called them, and said,
"What do you want Me to do for you?"
33 "Lord," they said to Him, "open our
eyes!"
34 Moved with compassion, Jesus
touched their eyes. Immediately they
could see, and they followed Him.
1 When they approached
Jerusalem and came to
Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus
then sent two disciples,
2 telling them, "Go into the village
ahead of you. At once you will ﬁnd a
donkey ed there, and a colt with her.
Un e them and bring them to Me.
3 If anyone says anything to you, you
should say that the Lord needs them,
and immediately he will send them."
4 This took place so that what was
spoken through the prophet might be
fulﬁlled:
21MATTHEW 21
110
5 Tell Daughter Zion, "See, your King is
coming to you, gentle, and mounted on
a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a
beast of burden."
6 The disciples went and did just as
Jesus directed them.
7 They brought the donkey and the colt;
then they laid their robes on them, and
He sat on them.
8 A very large crowd spread their
robes on the road; others were cu ng
branches from the trees and spreading
them on the road.
9 Then the crowds who went ahead
of Him and those who followed kept
shou ng: Hosanna to the Son of David!
Blessed is He who comes in the name
of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest
heaven!
10 When He entered Jerusalem, the
whole city was shaken, saying, "Who is
this?"MATTHEW 21
111
11 And the crowds kept saying, "This
is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in
Galilee!"
12 Jesus went into the temple complex
and drove out all those buying and
selling in the temple. He overturned the
money changers' tables and the chairs of
those selling doves.
13 And He said to them, "It is wri en,
My house will be called a house of
prayer. But you are making it a den of
thieves! "
14 The blind and the lame came to Him
in the temple complex, and He healed
them.
15 When the chief priests and the
scribes saw the wonders that He did
and the children in the temple complex
cheering, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
they were indignant
16 and said to Him, "Do You hear what
these children are saying?" "Yes," JesusMATTHEW 21
112
told them. "Have you never read: You
have prepared praise from the mouths
of children and nursing infants ?"
17 Then He le them, went out of the
city to Bethany, and spent the night
there.
18 Early in the morning, as He was
returning to the city, He was hungry.
19 Seeing a lone ﬁg tree by the road, He
went up to it and found nothing on it
except leaves. And He said to it, "May no
fruit ever come from you again!" At once
the ﬁg tree withered.
20 When the disciples saw it, they were
amazed and said, "How did the ﬁg tree
wither so quickly?"
21 Jesus answered them, "I assure you:
If you have faith and do not doubt, you
will not only do what was done to the ﬁg
tree, but even if you tell this mountain,
'Be li ed up and thrown into the sea,' it
will be done.MATTHEW 21
113
22 And if you believe, you will receive
whatever you ask for in prayer."
23 When He entered the temple
complex, the chief priests and the elders
of the people came up to Him as He was
teaching and said, "By what authority
are You doing these things? Who gave
You this authority?"
24 Jesus answered them, "I will also ask
you one ques on, and if you answer
it for Me, then I will tell you by what
authority I do these things.
25 Where did John's bap sm come
from? From heaven or from men?" They
began to argue among themselves, "If
we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us,
'Then why didn't you believe him?'
26 But if we say, 'From men,' we're
afraid of the crowd, because everyone
thought John was a prophet."
27 So they answered Jesus, "We don't
know." And He said to them, "NeitherMATTHEW 21
114
will I tell you by what authority I do
these things.
28 "But what do you think? A man had
two sons. He went to the ﬁrst and said,
'My son, go, work in the vineyard today.'
29 "He answered, 'I don't want to!' Yet
later he changed his mind and went.
30 Then the man went to the other
and said the same thing. "'I will, sir,' he
answered. But he didn't go.
31 "Which of the two did his father's
will?" "The ﬁrst," they said. Jesus said to
them, "I assure you: Tax collectors and
pros tutes are entering the kingdom of
God before you!
32 For John came to you in the way of
righteousness, and you didn't believe
him. Tax collectors and pros tutes did
believe him, but you, when you saw it,
didn't even change your minds then and
believe him.MATTHEW 21
115
33 "Listen to another parable: There
was a man, a landowner, who planted
a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a
winepress in it, and built a watchtower.
He leased it to tenant farmers and went
away.
34 When the grape harvest drew near,
he sent his slaves to the farmers to
collect his fruit.
35 But the farmers took his slaves, beat
one, killed another, and stoned a third.
36 Again, he sent other slaves, more
than the ﬁrst group, and they did the
same to them.
37 Finally, he sent his son to them. 'They
will respect my son,' he said.
38 "But when the tenant farmers saw
the son, they said among themselves,
'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and
take his inheritance!'
39 So they seized him and threw him
out of the vineyard, and killed him.MATTHEW 21
116
40 Therefore, when the owner of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those
farmers?"
41 "He will completely destroy those
terrible men," they told Him, "and lease
his vineyard to other farmers who will
give him his produce at the harvest."
42 Jesus said to them, "Have you never
read in the Scriptures: The stone that
the builders rejected has become the
cornerstone. This came from the Lord
and is wonderful in our eyes ?
43 Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of
God will be taken away from you and
given to a na on producing its fruit.
44 [Whoever falls on this stone will be
broken to pieces; but on whomever it
falls, it will grind him to powder!]"
45 When the chief priests and the
Pharisees heard His parables, they knew
He was speaking about them.MATTHEW 21 – 22
117
46 Although they were looking for a way
to arrest Him, they feared the crowds,
because they regarded Him as a prophet.
1 Once more Jesus spoke to them
in parables:
2 "The kingdom of heaven may be
compared to a king who gave a wedding
banquet for his son.
3 He sent out his slaves to summon
those invited to the banquet, but they
didn't want to come.
4 Again, he sent out other slaves, and
said, 'Tell those who are invited: Look,
I've prepared my dinner; my oxen and
fa ened ca le have been slaughtered,
and everything is ready. Come to the
wedding banquet. '
5 "But they paid no a en on and went
away, one to his own farm, another to
his business.
22MATTHEW 22
118
6 And the others seized his slaves,
treated them outrageously and killed
them.
7 The king was enraged, so he sent out
his troops, destroyed those murderers,
and burned down their city.
8 "Then he told his slaves, 'The banquet
is ready, but those who were invited
were not worthy.
9 Therefore, go to where the roads exit
the city and invite everyone you ﬁnd to
the banquet.'
10 So those slaves went out on the roads
and gathered everyone they found, both
evil and good. The wedding banquet was
ﬁlled with guests.
11 But when the king came in to view
the guests, he saw a man there who was
not dressed for a wedding.
12 So he said to him, 'Friend, how
did you get in here without wedding
clothes?' The man was speechless.MATTHEW 22
13 "Then the king told the a
119
endants,
'Tie him up hand and foot, and throw
him into the outer darkness, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of
teeth.'
14 "For many are invited, but few are
chosen."
15 Then the Pharisees went and plo ed
how to trap Him by what He said.
16 They sent their disciples to Him, with
the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we
know that You are truthful and teach
truthfully the way of God. You defer to
no one, for You don't show par ality.
17 Tell us, therefore, what You think. Is
it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
18 But perceiving their malice, Jesus
said, "Why are you tes ng Me,
hypocrites?
19 Show Me the coin used for the tax."
So they brought Him a denarius.MATTHEW 22
20 "Whose image and inscrip
120
on is
this?" He asked them.
21 "Caesar's," they said to Him. Then He
said to them, "Therefore, give back to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and
to God the things that are God's."
22 When they heard this, they were
amazed. So they le Him and went away.
23 The same day some Sadducees, who
say there is no resurrec on, came up to
Him and ques oned Him:
24 "Teacher, Moses said, if a man dies,
having no children, his brother is to
marry his wife and raise up oﬀspring for
his brother.
25 Now there were seven brothers
among us. The ﬁrst got married and
died. Having no oﬀspring, he le his wife
to his brother.
26 The same happened to the second
also, and the third, and so to all seven.
27 Then last of all the woman died.MATTHEW 22
28 Therefore, in the resurrec
121
on, whose
wife will she be of the seven? For they
all had married her."
29 Jesus answered them, "You are
deceived, because you don't know the
Scriptures or the power of God.
30 For in the resurrec on they neither
marry nor are given in marriage but are
like angels in heaven.
31 Now concerning the resurrec on of
the dead, haven't you read what was
spoken to you by God:
32 I am the God of Abraham and the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ? He
is not the God of the dead, but of the
living."
33 And when the crowds heard this,
they were astonished at His teaching.
34 When the Pharisees heard that He
had silenced the Sadducees, they came
together in the same place.MATTHEW 22
122
35 And one of them, an expert in the
law, asked a ques on to test Him:
36 "Teacher, which commandment in
the law is the greatest?"
37 He said to him, "Love the Lord your
God with all your heart, with all your
soul, and with all your mind.
38 This is the greatest and most
important commandment.
39 The second is like it: Love your
neighbor as yourself.
40 All the Law and the Prophets depend
on these two commandments."
41 While the Pharisees were together,
Jesus ques oned them,
42 "What do you think about the
Messiah? Whose Son is He?" "David's,"
they told Him.
43 He asked them, "How is it then that
David, inspired by the Spirit, calls Him
'Lord':MATTHEW 22 – 23
123
44 The Lord declared to my Lord, 'Sit at
My right hand un l I put Your enemies
under Your feet' ?
45 "If David calls Him 'Lord,' how then
can the Messiah be his Son"
46 No one was able to answer Him at
all, and from that day no one dared to
ques on Him any more.
1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds
and to His disciples:
2 "The scribes and the Pharisees are
seated in the chair of Moses.
3 Therefore do whatever they tell you
and observe it . But don't do what they
do, because they don't prac ce what
they teach.
4 They e up heavy loads that are
hard to carry and put them on people's
shoulders, but they themselves aren't
willing to li a ﬁnger to move them.
23MATTHEW 23
124
5 They do everything to be observed by
others: They enlarge their phylacteries
and lengthen their tassels.
6 They love the place of honor at
banquets, the front seats in the
synagogues,
7 gree ngs in the marketplaces, and to
be called 'Rabbi' by people.
8 "But as for you, do not be called
'Rabbi,' because you have one Teacher,
and you are all brothers.
9 Do not call anyone on earth your
father, because you have one Father,
who is in heaven.
10 And do not be called masters either,
because you have one Master, the
Messiah.
11 The greatest among you will be your
servant.
12 Whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself
will be exalted.MATTHEW 23
125
13 "But woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! You lock up the
kingdom of heaven from people. For you
don't go in, and you don't allow those
entering to go in.
14 ["Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You devour widows' houses
and make long prayers just for show.
This is why you will receive a harsher
punishment.]
15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You travel over land and sea
to make one proselyte, and when he
becomes one, you make him twice as ﬁt
for hell as you are!
16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say,
'Whoever takes an oath by the sanctuary,
it means nothing. But whoever takes
an oath by the gold of the sanctuary is
bound by his oath.'MATTHEW 23
126
17 Blind fools! For which is greater, the
gold or the sanctuary that sanc ﬁed the
gold?
18 Also, 'Whoever takes an oath by the
altar, it means nothing. But whoever
takes an oath by the gi that is on it is
bound by his oath.'
19 Blind people! For which is greater,
the gi or the altar that sanc ﬁes the
gi ?
20 Therefore the one who takes an oath
by the altar takes an oath by it and by
everything on it.
21 The one who takes an oath by the
sanctuary takes an oath by it and by Him
who dwells in it.
22 And the one who takes an oath by
heaven takes an oath by God's throne
and by Him who sits on it.
23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You pay a tenth of mint,
dill, and cumin, yet you have neglectedMATTHEW 23
127
the more important ma ers of the
law--jus ce, mercy, and faith. These
things should have been done without
neglec ng the others.
24 Blind guides! You strain out a gnat,
yet gulp down a camel!
25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You clean the outside of the
cup and dish, but inside they are full of
greed and self-indulgence!
26 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside
of the cup, so the outside of it may also
become clean.
27 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You are like whitewashed
tombs, which appear beau ful on the
outside, but inside are full of dead men's
bones and every impurity.
28 In the same way, on the outside you
seem righteous to people, but inside you
are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.MATTHEW 23
128
29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! You build the tombs of the
prophets and decorate the monuments
of the righteous,
30 and you say, 'If we had lived in the
days of our fathers, we wouldn't have
taken part with them in shedding the
prophets' blood.'
31 You therefore tes fy against
yourselves that you are sons of those
who murdered the prophets.
32 Fill up, then, the measure of your
fathers' sins!
33 "Snakes! Brood of vipers! How can
you escape being condemned to hell?
34 This is why I am sending you
prophets, sages, and scribes. Some of
them you will kill and crucify, and some
of them you will ﬂog in your synagogues
and hound from town to town.
35 So all the righteous blood shed on
the earth will be charged to you, fromMATTHEW 23 – 24
129
the blood of righteous Abel to the blood
of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom
you murdered between the sanctuary
and the altar.
36 I assure you: All these things will
come on this genera on!
37 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The city who
kills the prophets and stones those who
are sent to her. How o en I wanted to
gather your children together, as a hen
gathers her chicks under her wings, yet
you were not willing!
38 See, your house is le to you
desolate.
39 For I tell you, you will never see Me
again un l you say, Blessed is He who
comes in the name of the Lord! "
1 As Jesus le and was going
out of the temple complex,
His disciples came up and called His
a en on to the temple buildings.
24MATTHEW 24
130
2 Then He replied to them, "Don't you
see all these things? I assure you: Not
one stone will be le here on another
that will not be thrown down!"
3 While He was si ng on the Mount
of Olives, the disciples approached Him
privately and said, "Tell us, when will
these things happen? And what is the
sign of Your coming and of the end of
the age?"
4 Then Jesus replied to them: "Watch
out that no one deceives you.
5 For many will come in My name,
saying, 'I am the Messiah,' and they will
deceive many.
6 You are going to hear of wars and
rumors of wars. See that you are not
alarmed, because these things must take
place, but the end is not yet.
7 For na on will rise up against na on,
and kingdom against kingdom. There willMATTHEW 24
131
be famines and earthquakes in various
places.
8 All these events are the beginning of
birth pains.
9 "Then they will hand you over for
persecu on, and they will kill you. You
will be hated by all na ons because of
My name.
10 Then many will take oﬀense, betray
one another and hate one another.
11 Many false prophets will rise up and
deceive many.
12 Because lawlessness will mul ply,
the love of many will grow cold.
13 But the one who endures to the end
will be delivered.
14 This good news of the kingdom will
be proclaimed in all the world as a
tes mony to all na ons. And then the
end will come.
15 "So when you see the abomina on
that causes desola on , spoken of byMATTHEW 24
132
the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy
place" (let the reader understand),
16 "then those in Judea must ﬂee to the
mountains!
17 A man on the housetop must not
come down to get things out of his
house.
18 And a man in the ﬁeld must not go
back to get his clothes.
19 Woe to pregnant women and nursing
mothers in those days!
20 Pray that your escape may not be in
winter or on a Sabbath.
21 For at that me there will be great
tribula on, the kind that hasn't taken
place from the beginning of the world
un l now and never will again!
22 Unless those days were limited, no
one would survive. But those days will
be limited because of the elect.MATTHEW 24
133
23 "If anyone tells you then, 'Look, here
is the Messiah!' or, 'Over here!' do not
believe it!
24 False messiahs and false prophets
will arise and perform great signs and
wonders to lead astray, if possible, even
the elect.
25 Take note: I have told you in advance.
26 So if they tell you, 'Look, he's in the
wilderness!' don't go out; 'Look, he's in
the inner rooms!' do not believe it.
27 For as the lightning comes from the
east and ﬂashes as far as the west, so
will be the coming of the Son of Man.
28 Wherever the carcass is, there the
vultures will gather.
29 "Immediately a er the tribula on of
those days: The sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not shed its light;
the stars will fall from the sky, and the
celes al powers will be shaken.MATTHEW 24
134
30 "Then the sign of the Son of Man
will appear in the sky, and then all the
peoples of the earth will mourn; and
they will see the Son of Man coming on
the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory.
31 He will send out His angels with a
loud trumpet, and they will gather His
elect from the four winds, from one end
of the sky to the other.
32 "Now learn this parable from the
ﬁg tree: As soon as its branch becomes
tender and sprouts leaves, you know
that summer is near.
33 In the same way, when you see
all these things, recognize that He is
near--at the door!
34 I assure you: This genera on will
certainly not pass away un l all these
things take place.
35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but
My words will never pass away.MATTHEW 24
135
36 "Now concerning that day and hour
no one knows--neither the angels in
heaven, nor the Son--except the Father
only.
37 As the days of Noah were, so the
coming of the Son of Man will be.
38 For in those days before the ﬂood
they were ea ng and drinking, marrying
and giving in marriage, un l the day
Noah boarded the ark.
39 They didn't know un l the ﬂood
came and swept them all away. So this is
the way the coming of the Son of Man
will be:
40 Then two men will be in the ﬁeld:
one will be taken and one le .
41 Two women will be grinding at the
mill: one will be taken and one le .
42 Therefore be alert, since you don't
know what day your Lord is coming.
43 But know this: If the homeowner had
known what me the thief was coming,MATTHEW 24
136
he would have stayed alert and not let
his house be broken into.
44 This is why you also must be ready,
because the Son of Man is coming at an
hour you do not expect.
45 "Who then is a faithful and sensible
slave, whom his master has put in charge
of his household, to give them food at
the proper me?
46 That slave whose master ﬁnds
him working when he comes will be
rewarded.
47 I assure you: He will put him in charge
of all his possessions.
48 But if that wicked slave says in his
heart, 'My master is delayed,'
49 and starts to beat his fellow slaves,
and eats and drinks with drunkards,
50 that slave's master will come on a
day he does not expect and at an hour
he does not know.MATTHEW 24 – 25
137
51 He will cut him to pieces and assign
him a place with the hypocrites. In
that place there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.
1 "Then the kingdom of heaven
will be like 10 virgins who took
their lamps and went out to meet the
groom.
2 Five of them were foolish and ﬁve
were sensible.
3 When the foolish took their lamps,
they didn't take oil with them.
4 But the sensible ones took oil in their
ﬂasks with their lamps.
5 Since the groom was delayed, they all
became drowsy and fell asleep.
6 "In the middle of the night there was
a shout: 'Here's the groom! Come out to
meet him.'
7 "Then all those virgins got up and
trimmed their lamps.
25MATTHEW 25
138
8 But the foolish ones said to the
sensible ones, 'Give us some of your oil,
because our lamps are going out.'
9 "The sensible ones answered, 'No,
there won't be enough for us and for
you. Go instead to those who sell, and
buy oil for yourselves.'
10 "When they had gone to buy some,
the groom arrived. Then those who were
ready went in with him to the wedding
banquet, and the door was shut.
11 "Later the rest of the virgins also
came and said, 'Master, master, open up
for us!'
12 "But he replied, 'I assure you: I do
not know you!'
13 "Therefore be alert, because you
don't know either the day or the hour.
14 "For it is just like a man going on a
journey. He called his own slaves and
turned over his possessions to them.MATTHEW 25
139
15 To one he gave ﬁve talents; to
another, two; and to another, one--to
each according to his own ability. Then
he went on a journey. Immediately
16 the man who had received ﬁve
talents went, put them to work, and
earned ﬁve more.
17 In the same way the man with two
earned two more.
18 But the man who had received one
talent went oﬀ, dug a hole in the ground,
and hid his master's money.
19 "A er a long me the master of
those slaves came and se led accounts
with them.
20 The man who had received ﬁve
talents approached, presented ﬁve more
talents, and said, 'Master, you gave me
ﬁve talents. Look, I've earned ﬁve more
talents.'
21 "His master said to him, 'Well done,
good and faithful slave! You were faithfulMATTHEW 25
140
over a few things; I will put you in charge
of many things. Share your master's joy!'
22 "Then the man with two talents also
approached. He said, 'Master, you gave
me two talents. Look, I've earned two
more talents.'
23 "His master said to him, 'Well done,
good and faithful slave! You were faithful
over a few things; I will put you in charge
of many things. Share your master's joy!'
24 "Then the man who had received
one talent also approached and said,
'Master, I know you. You're a diﬃcult
man, reaping where you haven't sown
and gathering where you haven't
sca ered seed.
25 So I was afraid and went oﬀ and hid
your talent in the ground. Look, you
have what is yours.'
26 "But his master replied to him, 'You
evil, lazy slave! If you knew that I reapMATTHEW 25
141
where I haven't sown and gather where I
haven't sca ered,
27 then you should have deposited my
money with the bankers. And when
I returned I would have received my
money back with interest.
28 "'So take the talent from him and
give it to the one who has 10 talents.
29 For to everyone who has, more will
be given, and he will have more than
enough. But from the one who does not
have, even what he has will be taken
away from him.
30 And throw this good-for-nothing
slave into the outer darkness. In that
place there will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.'
31 "When the Son of Man comes in His
glory, and all the angels with Him, then
He will sit on the throne of His glory.
32 All the na ons will be gathered
before Him, and He will separate themMATTHEW 25
142
one from another, just as a shepherd
separates the sheep from the goats.
33 He will put the sheep on His right,
and the goats on the le .
34 Then the King will say to those on His
right, 'Come, you who are blessed by My
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the founda on of the world.
35 For I was hungry and you gave Me
something to eat; I was thirsty and you
gave Me something to drink; I was a
stranger and you took Me in;
36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I
was sick and you took care of Me; I was
in prison and you visited Me.'
37 "Then the righteous will answer
Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry
and feed You, or thirsty and give You
something to drink?
38 When did we see You a stranger
and take You in, or without clothes and
clothe You?MATTHEW 25
143
39 When did we see You sick, or in
prison, and visit You?'
40 "And the King will answer them, 'I
assure you: Whatever you did for one of
the least of these brothers of Mine, you
did for Me.'
41 Then He will also say to those on
the le , 'Depart from Me, you who are
cursed, into the eternal ﬁre prepared for
the Devil and his angels!
42 For I was hungry and you gave Me
nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you gave
Me nothing to drink;
43 I was a stranger and you didn't take
Me in; I was naked and you didn't clothe
Me, sick and in prison and you didn't
take care of Me.'
44 "Then they too will answer, 'Lord,
when did we see You hungry, or thirsty,
or a stranger, or without clothes, or sick,
or in prison, and not help You?'MATTHEW 25 – 26
144
45 "Then He will answer them, 'I assure
you: Whatever you did not do for one of
the least of these, you did not do for Me
either.'
46 "And they will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into
eternal life."
1 When Jesus had ﬁnished saying
all this, He told His disciples,
2 "You know that the Passover takes
place a er two days, and the Son of Man
will be handed over to be cruciﬁed."
3 Then the chief priests and the elders
of the people assembled in the palace of
the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
4 and they conspired to arrest Jesus in a
treacherous way and kill Him.
5 "Not during the fes val," they said,
"so there won't be rio ng among the
people."
26MATTHEW 26
145
6 While Jesus was in Bethany at the
house of Simon, a man who had a
serious skin disease,
7 a woman approached Him with an
alabaster jar of very expensive fragrant
oil. She poured it on His head as He was
reclining at the table.
8 When the disciples saw it, they were
indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
9 "This might have been sold for a great
deal and given to the poor."
10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them,
"Why are you bothering this woman?
She has done a noble thing for Me.
11 You always have the poor with you,
but you do not always have Me.
12 By pouring this fragrant oil on My
body, she has prepared Me for burial.
13 I assure you: Wherever this gospel
is proclaimed in the whole world, what
this woman has done will also be told in
memory of her."MATTHEW 26
146
14 Then one of the Twelve--the man
called Judas Iscariot--went to the chief
priests
15 and said, "What are you willing to
give me if I hand Him over to you?" So
they weighed out 30 pieces of silver for
him.
16 And from that me he started looking
for a good opportunity to betray Him.
17 On the ﬁrst day of Unleavened Bread
the disciples came to Jesus and asked,
"Where do You want us to prepare the
Passover so You may eat it?"
18 "Go into the city to a certain man,"
He said, "and tell him, 'The Teacher says:
My me is near; I am celebra ng the
Passover at your place with My disciples.
'"
19 So the disciples did as Jesus had
directed them and prepared the
Passover.MATTHEW 26
147
20 When evening came, He was reclining
at the table with the Twelve.
21 While they were ea ng, He said, "I
assure you: One of you will betray Me."
22 Deeply distressed, each one began to
say to Him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
23 He replied, "The one who dipped his
hand with Me in the bowl--he will betray
Me.
24 The Son of Man will go just as it is
wri en about Him, but woe to that man
by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It
would have been be er for that man if
he had not been born."
25 Then Judas, His betrayer, replied,
"Surely not I, Rabbi?" "You have said it,"
He told him.
26 As they were ea ng, Jesus took
bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to
the disciples, and said, "Take and eat it;
this is My body."MATTHEW 26
27 Then He took a cup, and a
148
er giving
thanks, He gave it to them and said,
"Drink from it, all of you.
28 For this is My blood that establishes
the covenant; it is shed for many for the
forgiveness of sins.
29 But I tell you, from this moment I will
not drink of this fruit of the vine un l
that day when I drink it in a new way in
My Father's kingdom with you."
30 A er singing psalms, they went out
to the Mount of Olives.
31 Then Jesus said to them, "Tonight all
of you will run away because of Me, for it
is wri en: I will strike the shepherd, and
the sheep of the ﬂock will be sca ered.
32 But a er I have been resurrected, I
will go ahead of you to Galilee."
33 Peter told Him, "Even if everyone
runs away because of You, I will never
run away!"MATTHEW 26
149
34 "I assure you," Jesus said to him,
"tonight--before the rooster crows, you
will deny Me three mes!"
35 "Even if I have to die with You," Peter
told Him, "I will never deny You!" And all
the disciples said the same thing.
36 Then Jesus came with them to a
place called Gethsemane, and He told
the disciples, "Sit here while I go over
there and pray."
37 Taking along Peter and the two sons
of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful
and deeply distressed.
38 Then He said to them, "My soul is
swallowed up in sorrow--to the point of
death. Remain here and stay awake with
Me."
39 Going a li le farther, He fell facedown
and prayed, "My Father! If it is possible,
let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I
will, but as You will."MATTHEW 26
150
40 Then He came to the disciples and
found them sleeping. He asked Peter.
"So, couldn't you stay awake with Me
one hour?
41 Stay awake and pray, so that you
won't enter into tempta on. The spirit is
willing, but the ﬂesh is weak."
42 Again, a second me, He went away
and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot
pass unless I drink it, Your will be done."
43 And He came again and found them
sleeping, because they could not keep
their eyes open.
44 A er leaving them, He went away
again and prayed a third me, saying the
same thing once more.
45 Then He came to the disciples and
said to them, "Are you s ll sleeping and
res ng? Look, the me is near. The Son
of Man is being betrayed into the hands
of sinners.MATTHEW 26
151
46 Get up; let's go! See--My betrayer is
near."
47 While He was s ll speaking, Judas,
one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived.
A large mob, with swords and clubs,
was with him from the chief priests and
elders of the people.
48 His betrayer had given them a sign:
"The One I kiss, He's the One; arrest
Him!"
49 So he went right up to Jesus and said,
"Gree ngs, Rabbi!"--and kissed Him.
50 "Friend," Jesus asked him, "why have
you come?" Then they came up, took
hold of Jesus, and arrested Him.
51 At that moment one of those with
Jesus reached out his hand and drew his
sword. He struck the high priest's slave
and cut oﬀ his ear.
52 Then Jesus told him, "Put your sword
back in place because all who take up a
sword will perish by a sword.MATTHEW 26
152
53 Or do you think that I cannot call
on My Father, and He will provide Me
at once with more than 12 legions of
angels?
54 How, then, would the Scriptures be
fulﬁlled that say it must happen this
way?"
55 At that me Jesus said to the crowds,
"Have you come out with swords and
clubs, as if I were a criminal, to capture
Me? Every day I used to sit, teaching
in the temple complex, and you didn't
arrest Me.
56 But all this has happened so that the
prophe c Scriptures would be fulﬁlled."
Then all the disciples deserted Him and
ran away.
57 Those who had arrested Jesus led
Him away to Caiaphas the high priest,
where the scribes and the elders had
convened.MATTHEW 26
153
58 Meanwhile, Peter was following
Him at a distance right to the high
priest's courtyard. He went in and was
si ng with the temple police to see the
outcome.
59 The chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were looking for false
tes mony against Jesus so they could
put Him to death.
60 But they could not ﬁnd any, even
though many false witnesses came
forward. Finally, two who came forward
61 stated, "This man said, 'I can
demolish God's sanctuary and rebuild it
in three days.'"
62 The high priest then stood up and
said to Him, "Don't You have an answer
to what these men are tes fying against
You?"
63 But Jesus kept silent. Then the high
priest said to Him, "By the living God IMATTHEW 26
154
place You under oath: tell us if You are
the Messiah, the Son of God!"
64 "You have said it," Jesus told him.
"But I tell you, in the future you will see
the Son of Man seated at the right hand
of the Power and coming on the clouds
of heaven ."
65 Then the high priest tore his robes
and said, "He has blasphemed! Why
do we s ll need witnesses? Look, now
you've heard the blasphemy!
66 What is your decision?" They
answered, "He deserves death!"
67 Then they spit in His face and beat
Him; others slapped Him
68 and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah!
Who hit You?"
69 Now Peter was si ng outside in the
courtyard. A servant approached him
and she said, "You were with Jesus the
Galilean too."MATTHEW 26 – 27
155
70 But he denied it in front of everyone:
"I don't know what you're talking
about!"
71 When he had gone out to the
gateway, another woman saw him and
told those who were there, "This man
was with Jesus the Nazarene!"
72 And again he denied it with an oath,
"I don't know the man!"
73 A er a li le while those standing
there approached and said to Peter, "You
certainly are one of them, since even
your accent gives you away."
74 Then he started to curse and to swear
with an oath, "I do not know the man!"
Immediately a rooster crowed,
75 and Peter remembered the words
Jesus had spoken, "Before the rooster
crows, you will deny Me three mes."
And he went outside and wept bi erly.
1 When daybreak came, all the
chief priests and the elders of the
27MATTHEW 27
156
people plo ed against Jesus to put Him
to death.
2 A er tying Him up, they led Him away
and handed Him over to Pilate, the
governor.
3 Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that
He had been condemned, was full of
remorse and returned the 30 pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders.
4 "I have sinned by betraying innocent
blood," he said. "What's that to us?"
they said. "See to it yourself!"
5 So he threw the silver into the
sanctuary and departed. Then he went
and hanged himself.
6 The chief priests took the silver
and said, "It's not lawful to put it into
the temple treasury, since it is blood
money."
7 So they conferred together and
bought the po er's ﬁeld with it as a
burial place for foreigners.MATTHEW 27
157
8 Therefore that ﬁeld has been called
"Blood Field" to this day.
9 Then what was spoken through the
prophet Jeremiah was fulﬁlled: They
took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of
Him whose price was set by the sons of
Israel,
10 and they gave them for the po er's
ﬁeld, as the Lord directed me.
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor.
"Are You the King of the Jews?" the
governor asked Him. Jesus answered,
"You have said it."
12 And while He was being accused by
the chief priests and elders, He didn't
answer.
13 Then Pilate said to Him, "Don't You
hear how much they are tes fying
against You?"
14 But He didn't answer him on even
one charge, so that the governor was
greatly amazed.MATTHEW 27
15 At the fes
158
val the governor's custom
was to release to the crowd a prisoner
they wanted.
16 At that me they had a notorious
prisoner called Barabbas.
17 So when they had gathered together,
Pilate said to them, "Who is it you want
me to release for you--Barabbas, or
Jesus who is called Messiah?"
18 For he knew they had handed Him
over because of envy.
19 While he was si ng on the judge's
bench, his wife sent word to him, "Have
nothing to do with that righteous man,
for today I've suﬀered terribly in a dream
because of Him!"
20 The chief priests and the elders,
however, persuaded the crowds to ask
for Barabbas and to execute Jesus.
21 The governor asked them, "Which of
the two do you want me to release for
you?" "Barabbas!" they answered.MATTHEW 27
159
22 Pilate asked them, "What should I do
then with Jesus, who is called Messiah?"
They all answered, "Crucify Him!"
23 Then he said, "Why? What has He
done wrong?" But they kept shou ng,
"Crucify Him!" all the more.
24 When Pilate saw that he was ge ng
nowhere, but that a riot was star ng
instead, he took some water, washed his
hands in front of the crowd, and said, "I
am innocent of this man's blood. See to
it yourselves!"
25 All the people answered, "His blood
be on us and on our children!"
26 Then he released Barabbas to them.
But a er having Jesus ﬂogged, he
handed Him over to be cruciﬁed.
27 Then the governor's soldiers took
Jesus into headquarters and gathered
the whole company around Him.
28 They stripped Him and dressed Him
in a scarlet robe.MATTHEW 27
160
29 They twisted together a crown of
thorns, put it on His head, and placed a
reed in His right hand. And they knelt
down before Him and mocked Him:
"Hail, King of the Jews!"
30 Then they spit at Him, took the reed,
and kept hi ng Him on the head.
31 When they had mocked Him, they
stripped Him of the robe, put His clothes
on Him, and led Him away to crucify
Him.
32 As they were going out, they found
a Cyrenian man named Simon. They
forced this man to carry His cross.
33 When they came to a place called
Golgotha (which means Skull Place),
34 they gave Him wine mixed with gall
to drink. But when He tasted it, He would
not drink it.
35 A er crucifying Him they divided His
clothes by cas ng lots.MATTHEW 27
161
36 Then they sat down and were
guarding Him there.
37 Above His head they put up the
charge against Him in wri ng: THIS IS
JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS
38 Then two criminals were cruciﬁed
with Him, one on the right and one on
the le .
39 Those who passed by were yelling
insults at Him, shaking their heads
40 and saying, "The One who would
demolish the sanctuary and rebuild it in
three days, save Yourself! If You are the
Son of God, come down from the cross!"
41 In the same way the chief priests,
with the scribes and elders, mocked Him
and said,
42 "He saved others, but He cannot save
Himself! He is the King of Israel! Let Him
come down now from the cross, and we
will believe in Him.MATTHEW 27
162
43 He has put His trust in God; let God
rescue Him now--if He wants Him! For
He said, 'I am God's Son.'"
44 In the same way even the criminals
who were cruciﬁed with Him kept
taun ng Him.
45 From noon un l three in the
a ernoon darkness came over the whole
land.
46 At about three in the a ernoon Jesus
cried out with a loud voice, "Elí, Elí, lemá
sabachtháni? " that is, "My God, My
God, why have You forsaken Me? "
47 When some of those standing there
heard this, they said, "He's calling for
Elijah!"
48 Immediately one of them ran and got
a sponge, ﬁlled it with sour wine, ﬁxed it
on a reed, and oﬀered Him a drink.
49 But the rest said, "Let's see if Elijah
comes to save Him!"MATTHEW 27
163
50 Jesus shouted again with a loud voice
and gave up His spirit.
51 Suddenly, the curtain of the
sanctuary was split in two from top to
bo om; the earth quaked and the rocks
were split.
52 The tombs also were opened and
many bodies of the saints who had gone
to their rest were raised.
53 And they came out of the tombs a er
His resurrec on, entered the holy city,
and appeared to many.
54 When the centurion and those with
him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the
earthquake and the things that had
happened, they were terriﬁed and said,
"This man really was God's Son!"
55 Many women who had followed
Jesus from Galilee and ministered to Him
were there, looking on from a distance.MATTHEW 27
164
56 Among them were Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
57 When it was evening, a rich man
from Arimathea named Joseph came,
who himself had also become a disciple
of Jesus.
58 He approached Pilate and asked for
Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered that it
be released.
59 So Joseph took the body, wrapped it
in clean, ﬁne linen,
60 and placed it in his new tomb, which
he had cut into the rock. He le a er
rolling a great stone against the entrance
of the tomb.
61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
were seated there, facing the tomb.
62 The next day, which followed the
prepara on day, the chief priests and
the Pharisees gathered before PilateMATTHEW 27 – 28
165
63 and said, "Sir, we remember that
while this deceiver was s ll alive, He
said, 'A er three days I will rise again.'
64 Therefore give orders that the tomb
be made secure un l the third day.
Otherwise, His disciples may come, steal
Him, and tell the people, 'He has been
raised from the dead.' Then the last
decep on will be worse than the ﬁrst."
65 "You have a guard of soldiers ," Pilate
told them. "Go and make it as secure as
you know how."
66 Then they went and made the tomb
secure by sealing the stone and se ng
the guard.
1 A er the Sabbath, as the ﬁrst
day of the week was dawning,
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
went to view the tomb.
2 Suddenly there was a violent
earthquake, because an angel of the
Lord descended from heaven and
28MATTHEW 28
166
approached the tomb . He rolled back
the stone and was si ng on it.
3 His appearance was like lightning, and
his robe was as white as snow.
4 The guards were so shaken from fear
of him that they became like dead men.
5 But the angel told the women, "Don't
be afraid, because I know you are looking
for Jesus who was cruciﬁed.
6 He is not here! For He has been
resurrected, just as He said. Come and
see the place where He lay.
7 Then go quickly and tell His disciples,
'He has been raised from the dead. In
fact, He is going ahead of you to Galilee;
you will see Him there.' Listen, I have
told you."
8 So, depar ng quickly from the tomb
with fear and great joy, they ran to tell
His disciples the news.MATTHEW 28
167
9 Just then Jesus met them and said,
"Good morning!" They came up, took
hold of His feet, and worshiped Him.
10 Then Jesus told them, "Do not be
afraid. Go and tell My brothers to leave
for Galilee, and they will see Me there."
11 As they were on their way, some
of the guard came into the city and
reported to the chief priests everything
that had happened.
12 A er the priests had assembled with
the elders and agreed on a plan, they
gave the soldiers a large sum of money
13 and told them, "Say this, 'His disciples
came during the night and stole Him
while we were sleeping.'
14 If this reaches the governor's ears,
we will deal with him and keep you out
of trouble."
15 So they took the money and did as
they were instructed. And this story hasMATTHEW 28
168
been spread among Jewish people to
this day.
16 The 11 disciples traveled to Galilee,
to the mountain where Jesus had
directed them.
17 When they saw Him, they worshiped,
but some doubted.
18 Then Jesus came near and said to
them, "All authority has been given to
Me in heaven and on earth.
19 Go, therefore, and make disciples of
all na ons, bap zing them in the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit,
20 teaching them to observe everything
I have commanded you. And remember,
I am with you always, to the end of the
age."Mark
1
1 The beginning of the gospel of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
2 As it is wri en in Isaiah the prophet:
Look, I am sending My messenger ahead
of You, who will prepare Your way.
3 A voice of one crying out in the
wilderness: "Prepare the way for the
Lord; make His paths straight!"
4 John came bap zing in the wilderness
and preaching a bap sm of repentance
for the forgiveness of sins.
5 The whole Judean countryside and all
the people of Jerusalem were ﬂocking to
him, and they were bap zed by him in
the Jordan River as they confessed their
sins.MARK 1
2
6 John wore a camel-hair garment with
a leather belt around his waist and ate
locusts and wild honey.
7 He was preaching: "Someone more
powerful than I will come a er me. I am
not worthy to stoop down and un e the
strap of His sandals.
8 I have bap zed you with water, but He
will bap ze you with the Holy Spirit."
9 In those days Jesus came from
Nazareth in Galilee and was bap zed in
the Jordan by John.
10 As soon as He came up out of the
water, He saw the heavens being torn
open and the Spirit descending to Him
like a dove.
11 And a voice came from heaven: You
are My beloved Son; I take delight in
You!
12 Immediately the Spirit drove Him
into the wilderness.MARK 1
3
13 He was in the wilderness 40 days,
being tempted by Satan. He was with
the wild animals, and the angels began
to serve Him.
14 A er John was arrested, Jesus went
to Galilee, preaching the good news of
God:
15 "The me is fulﬁlled, and the
kingdom of God has come near. Repent
and believe in the good news!"
16 As He was passing along by the Sea
of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew,
Simon's brother. They were cas ng a net
into the sea, since they were ﬁshermen.
17 "Follow Me," Jesus told them, "and I
will make you ﬁsh for people!"
18 Immediately they le their nets and
followed Him.
19 Going on a li le farther, He saw
James the son of Zebedee and his
brother John. They were in their boat
mending their nets.MARK 1
4
20 Immediately He called them, and
they le their father Zebedee in the boat
with the hired men and followed Him.
21 Then they went into Capernaum, and
right away He entered the synagogue on
the Sabbath and began to teach.
22 They were astonished at His teaching
because, unlike the scribes, He was
teaching them as one having authority.
23 Just then a man with an unclean
spirit was in their synagogue. He cried
out,
24 "What do You have to do with us,
Jesus--Nazarene? Have You come to
destroy us? I know who You are--the
Holy One of God!"
25 But Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be
quiet, and come out of him!"
26 And the unclean spirit convulsed him,
shouted with a loud voice, and came out
of him.MARK 1
5
27 Then they were all amazed, so
they began to argue with one another,
saying, "What is this? A new teaching
with authority! He commands even the
unclean spirits, and they obey Him."
28 His fame then spread throughout the
en re vicinity of Galilee.
29 As soon as they le the synagogue,
they went into Simon and Andrew's
house with James and John.
30 Simon's mother-in-law was lying in
bed with a fever, and they told Him
about her at once.
31 So He went to her, took her by the
hand, and raised her up. The fever le
her, and she began to serve them.
32 When evening came, a er the sun
had set, they began bringing to Him all
those who were sick and those who
were demon-possessed.
33 The whole town was assembled at
the door,MARK 1
6
34 and He healed many who were sick
with various diseases and drove out
many demons. But He would not permit
the demons to speak, because they
knew Him.
35 Very early in the morning, while it
was s ll dark, He got up, went out, and
made His way to a deserted place. And
He was praying there.
36 Simon and his companions went
searching for Him.
37 They found Him and said, "Everyone's
looking for You!"
38 And He said to them, "Let's go on to
the neighboring villages so that I may
preach there too. This is why I have
come."
39 So He went into all of Galilee,
preaching in their synagogues and
driving out demons.
40 Then a man with a serious skin
disease came to Him and, on his knees,MARK 1
7
begged Him: "If You are willing, You can
make me clean."
41 Moved with compassion, Jesus
reached out His hand and touched him.
"I am willing," He told him. "Be made
clean."
42 Immediately the disease le him,
and he was healed.
43 Then He sternly warned him and sent
him away at once,
44 telling him, "See that you say nothing
to anyone; but go and show yourself
to the priest, and oﬀer what Moses
prescribed for your cleansing, as a
tes mony to them."
45 Yet he went out and began to
proclaim it widely and to spread the
news, with the result that Jesus could no
longer enter a town openly. But He was
out in deserted places, and they would
come to Him from everywhere.MARK 2
2
8
1 When He entered Capernaum again
a er some days, it was reported that
He was at home.
2 So many people gathered together
that there was no more room, not even
in the doorway, and He was speaking the
message to them.
3 Then they came to Him bringing a
paraly c, carried by four men.
4 Since they were not able to bring him
to Jesus because of the crowd, they
removed the roof above where He was.
And when they had broken through,
they lowered the stretcher on which the
paraly c was lying.
5 Seeing their faith, Jesus told the
paraly c, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
6 But some of the scribes were si ng
there, thinking to themselves:
7 "Why does He speak like this? He's
blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but
God alone?"MARK 2
9
8 Right away Jesus understood in His
spirit that they were reasoning like this
within themselves and said to them,
"Why are you reasoning these things in
your hearts?
9 Which is easier: to say to the paraly c,
'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get
up, pick up your stretcher, and walk'?
10 But so you may know that the Son
of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins," He told the paraly c,
11 "I tell you: get up, pick up your
stretcher, and go home."
12 Immediately he got up, picked up
the stretcher, and went out in front
of everyone. As a result, they were all
astounded and gave glory to God, saying,
"We have never seen anything like this!"
13 Then Jesus went out again beside the
sea. The whole crowd was coming to
Him, and He taught them.MARK 2
10
14 Then, moving on, He saw Levi the
son of Alphaeus si ng at the tax oﬃce,
and He said to him, "Follow Me!" So he
got up and followed Him.
15 While He was reclining at the table
in Levi's house, many tax collectors and
sinners were also guests with Jesus and
His disciples, because there were many
who were following Him.
16 When the scribes of the Pharisees
saw that He was ea ng with sinners and
tax collectors, they asked His disciples,
"Why does He eat with tax collectors
and sinners?"
17 When Jesus heard this, He told them,
"Those who are well don't need a doctor,
but the sick do need one . I didn't come
to call the righteous, but sinners."
18 Now John's disciples and the
Pharisees were fas ng. People came and
asked Him, "Why do John's disciples andMARK 2
11
the Pharisees' disciples fast, but Your
disciples do not fast?"
19 Jesus said to them, "The wedding
guests cannot fast while the groom is
with them, can they? As long as they
have the groom with them, they cannot
fast.
20 But the me will come when the
groom is taken away from them, and
then they will fast in that day.
21 No one sews a patch of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the
new patch pulls away from the old cloth,
and a worse tear is made.
22 And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst
the skins, and the wine is lost as well
as the skins. But new wine is for fresh
wineskins."
23 On the Sabbath He was going through
the grainﬁelds, and His disciples beganMARK 2 – 3
12
to make their way picking some heads of
grain.
24 The Pharisees said to Him, "Look,
why are they doing what is not lawful on
the Sabbath?"
25 He said to them, "Have you never
read what David and those who were
with him did when he was in need and
hungry--
26 how he entered the house of God in
the me of Abiathar the high priest and
ate the sacred bread--which is not lawful
for anyone to eat except the priests--and
also gave some to his companions?"
27 Then He told them, "The Sabbath
was made for man and not man for the
Sabbath.
28 Therefore the Son of Man is Lord
even of the Sabbath."
1 Now He entered the synagogue
again, and a man was there who had
a paralyzed hand.
3MARK 3
13
2 In order to accuse Him, they were
watching Him closely to see whether He
would heal him on the Sabbath.
3 He told the man with the paralyzed
hand, "Stand before us."
4 Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on
the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to
save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
5 A er looking around at them with
anger and sorrow at the hardness of
their hearts, He told the man, "Stretch
out your hand." So he stretched it out,
and his hand was restored.
6 Immediately the Pharisees went out
and started plo ng with the Herodians
against Him, how they might destroy
Him.
7 Jesus departed with His disciples to
the sea, and a great mul tude followed
from Galilee, Judea,
8 Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the
Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. TheMARK 3
14
great mul tude came to Him because
they heard about everything He was
doing.
9 Then He told His disciples to have a
small boat ready for Him, so the crowd
would not crush Him.
10 Since He had healed many, all who
had diseases were pressing toward Him
to touch Him.
11 Whenever the unclean spirits saw
Him, those possessed fell down before
Him and cried out, "You are the Son of
God!"
12 And He would strongly warn them
not to make Him known.
13 Then He went up the mountain and
summoned those He wanted, and they
came to Him.
14 He also appointed 12--He also named
them apostles--to be with Him, to send
them out to preach,MARK 3
15
15 and to have authority to drive out
demons.
16 He appointed the Twelve: To Simon,
He gave the name Peter;
17 and to James the son of Zebedee,
and to his brother John, He gave the
name "Boanerges" (that is, "Sons of
Thunder");
18 Andrew; Philip and Bartholomew;
Ma hew and Thomas; James the son
of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the
Zealot,
19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
Him.
20 Then He went home, and the crowd
gathered again so that they were not
even able to eat.
21 When His family heard this, they set
out to restrain Him, because they said,
"He's out of His mind."
22 The scribes who had come down
from Jerusalem said, "He has BeelzebulMARK 3
16
in Him!" and, "He drives out demons by
the ruler of the demons!"
23 So He summoned them and spoke to
them in parables: "How can Satan drive
out Satan?
24 If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand.
25 If a house is divided against itself,
that house cannot stand.
26 And if Satan rebels against himself
and is divided, he cannot stand but is
ﬁnished!
27 "On the other hand, no one can
enter a strong man's house and rob his
possessions unless he ﬁrst es up the
strong man. Then he will rob his house.
28 I assure you: People will be forgiven
for all sins and whatever blasphemies
they may blaspheme.
29 But whoever blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is
guilty of an eternal sin"--MARK 3 – 4
17
30 because they were saying, "He has
an unclean spirit."
31 Then His mother and His brothers
came, and standing outside, they sent
word to Him and called Him.
32 A crowd was si ng around Him
and told Him, "Look, Your mother, Your
brothers, and Your sisters are outside
asking for You."
33 He replied to them, "Who are My
mother and My brothers?"
34 And looking about at those who were
si ng in a circle around Him, He said,
"Here are My mother and My brothers!
35 Whoever does the will of God is My
brother and sister and mother."
1 Again He began to teach by the
sea, and a very large crowd gathered
around Him. So He got into a boat on
the sea and sat down, while the whole
crowd was on the shore facing the sea.
4MARK 4
18
2 He taught them many things in
parables, and in His teaching He said to
them:
3 "Listen! Consider the sower who went
out to sow.
4 As he sowed, this occurred: Some
seed fell along the path, and the birds
came and ate it up.
5 Other seed fell on rocky ground where
it didn't have much soil, and it sprang up
right away, since it didn't have deep soil.
6 When the sun came up, it was
scorched, and since it didn't have a root,
it withered.
7 Other seed fell among thorns, and the
thorns came up and choked it, and it
didn't produce a crop.
8 S ll others fell on good ground and
produced a crop that increased 30, 60,
and 100 mes what was sown ."
9 Then He said, "Anyone who has ears
to hear should listen!"MARK 4
19
10 When He was alone with the Twelve,
those who were around Him asked Him
about the parables.
11 He answered them, "The secret of
the kingdom of God has been granted
to you, but to those outside, everything
comes in parables
12 so that they may look and look, yet
not perceive; they may listen and listen,
yet not understand; otherwise, they
might turn back--and be forgiven. "
13 Then He said to them: "Do you not
understand this parable? How then will
you understand any of the parables?
14 The sower sows the word.
15 These are the ones along the path
where the word is sown: when they
hear, immediately Satan comes and
takes away the word sown in them.
16 And these are the ones sown on
rocky ground: when they hear the word,
immediately they receive it with joy.MARK 4
20
17 But they have no root in themselves;
they are short-lived. When aﬄic on or
persecu on comes because of the word,
they immediately stumble.
18 Others are sown among thorns;
these are the ones who hear the word,
19 but the worries of this age, the
seduc on of wealth, and the desires
for other things enter in and choke the
word, and it becomes unfrui ul.
20 But the ones sown on good ground
are those who hear the word, welcome
it, and produce a crop: 30, 60, and 100
mes what was sown ."
21 He also said to them, "Is a lamp
brought in to be put under a basket
or under a bed? Isn't it to be put on a
lampstand?
22 For nothing is concealed except to be
revealed, and nothing hidden except to
come to light.MARK 4
21
23 If anyone has ears to hear, he should
listen!"
24 Then He said to them, "Pay a en on
to what you hear. By the measure you
use, it will be measured and added to
you.
25 For to the one who has, it will be
given, and from the one who does not
have, even what he has will be taken
away."
26 "The kingdom of God is like this,"
He said. "A man sca ers seed on the
ground;
27 he sleeps and rises--night and day,
and the seed sprouts and grows--he
doesn't know how.
28 The soil produces a crop by itself--ﬁrst
the blade, then the head, and then the
ripe grain on the head.
29 But as soon as the crop is ready, he
sends for the sickle, because harvest has
come."MARK 4
22
30 And He said: "How can we illustrate
the kingdom of God, or what parable can
we use to describe it?
31 It's like a mustard seed that, when
sown in the soil, is smaller than all the
seeds on the ground.
32 And when sown, it comes up and
grows taller than all the vegetables, and
produces large branches, so that the
birds of the sky can nest in its shade."
33 He would speak the word to them
with many parables like these, as they
were able to understand.
34 And He did not speak to them
without a parable. Privately, however,
He would explain everything to His own
disciples.
35 On that day, when evening had come,
He told them, "Let's cross over to the
other side of the lake ."MARK 4 – 5
36 So they le
23
the crowd and took Him
along since He was already in the boat.
And other boats were with Him.
37 A ﬁerce windstorm arose, and the
waves were breaking over the boat,
so that the boat was already being
swamped.
38 But He was in the stern, sleeping on
the cushion. So they woke Him up and
said to Him, "Teacher! Don't you care
that we're going to die?"
39 He got up, rebuked the wind, and
said to the sea, "Silence! Be s ll!" The
wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
40 Then He said to them, "Why are you
fearful? Do you s ll have no faith?"
41 And they were terriﬁed and asked
one another, "Who then is this? Even the
wind and the sea obey Him!"
1 Then they came to the other side
of the sea, to the region of the
Gerasenes.
5MARK 5
24
2 As soon as He got out of the boat, a
man with an unclean spirit came out of
the tombs and met Him.
3 He lived in the tombs. No one was
able to restrain him any more--even with
chains--
4 because he o en had been bound
with shackles and chains, but had
snapped oﬀ the chains and smashed the
shackles. No one was strong enough to
subdue him.
5 And always, night and day, he was
crying out among the tombs and in the
mountains and cu ng himself with
stones.
6 When he saw Jesus from a distance,
he ran and knelt down before Him.
7 And he cried out with a loud voice,
"What do You have to do with me, Jesus,
Son of the Most High God? I beg You
before God, don't torment me!"MARK 5
25
8 For He had told him, "Come out of the
man, you unclean spirit!"
9 "What is your name?" He asked him.
"My name is Legion," he answered Him,
"because we are many."
10 And he kept begging Him not to send
them out of the region.
11 Now a large herd of pigs was there,
feeding on the hillside.
12 The demons begged Him, "Send us
to the pigs, so we may enter them."
13 And He gave them permission. Then
the unclean spirits came out and entered
the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000
rushed down the steep bank into the sea
and drowned there.
14 The men who tended them ran oﬀ
and reported it in the town and the
countryside, and people went to see
what had happened.
15 They came to Jesus and saw the man
who had been demon-possessed by theMARK 5
26
legion, si ng there, dressed and in his
right mind; and they were afraid.
16 The eyewitnesses described to
them what had happened to the
demon-possessed man and told about
the pigs.
17 Then they began to beg Him to leave
their region.
18 As He was ge ng into the boat, the
man who had been demon-possessed
kept begging Him to be with Him.
19 But He would not let him; instead, He
told him, "Go back home to your own
people, and report to them how much
the Lord has done for you and how He
has had mercy on you."
20 So he went out and began to proclaim
in the Decapolis how much Jesus had
done for him, and they were all amazed.
21 When Jesus had crossed over again
by boat to the other side, a large crowdMARK 5
27
gathered around Him while He was by
the sea.
22 One of the synagogue leaders,
named Jairus, came, and when he saw
Jesus, he fell at His feet
23 and kept begging Him, "My li le
daughter is at death's door. Come and
lay Your hands on her so she can get well
and live."
24 So Jesus went with him, and a
large crowd was following and pressing
against Him.
25 A woman suﬀering from bleeding for
12 years
26 had endured much under many
doctors. She had spent everything she
had and was not helped at all. On the
contrary, she became worse.
27 Having heard about Jesus, she came
behind Him in the crowd and touched
His robe.MARK 5
28
28 For she said, "If I can just touch His
robes, I'll be made well!"
29 Instantly her ﬂow of blood ceased,
and she sensed in her body that she was
cured of her aﬄic on.
30 At once Jesus realized in Himself
that power had gone out from Him. He
turned around in the crowd and said,
"Who touched My robes?"
31 His disciples said to Him, "You see
the crowd pressing against You, and You
say, 'Who touched Me?'"
32 So He was looking around to see who
had done this.
33 Then the woman, knowing what had
happened to her, came with fear and
trembling, fell down before Him, and
told Him the whole truth.
34 "Daughter," He said to her, "your
faith has made you well. Go in peace and
be free from your aﬄic on."MARK 5
35 While He was s
29
ll speaking, people
came from the synagogue leader's house
and said, "Your daughter is dead. Why
bother the Teacher any more?"
36 But when Jesus overheard what
was said, He told the synagogue leader,
"Don't be afraid. Only believe."
37 He did not let anyone accompany
Him except Peter, James, and John,
James' brother.
38 They came to the leader's house, and
He saw a commo on--people weeping
and wailing loudly.
39 He went in and said to them, "Why
are you making a commo on and
weeping? The child is not dead but
asleep."
40 They started laughing at Him, but He
put them all outside. He took the child's
father, mother, and those who were with
Him, and entered the place where the
child was.MARK 5 – 6
30
41 Then He took the child by the hand
and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which
is translated, "Li le girl, I say to you, get
up!").
42 Immediately the girl got up and
began to walk. (She was 12 years old.) At
this they were u erly astounded.
43 Then He gave them strict orders that
no one should know about this and said
that she should be given something to
eat.
1 He went away from there and came
to His hometown, and His disciples
followed Him.
2 When the Sabbath came, He began to
teach in the synagogue, and many who
heard Him were astonished. "Where did
this man get these things?" they said.
"What is this wisdom given to Him, and
how are these miracles performed by
His hands?
6MARK 6
31
3 Isn't this the carpenter, the son of
Mary, and the brother of James, Joses,
Judas, and Simon? And aren't His sisters
here with us?" So they were oﬀended by
Him.
4 Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet
is not without honor except in his
hometown, among his rela ves, and in
his household."
5 So He was not able to do any miracles
there, except that He laid His hands on a
few sick people and healed them.
6 And He was amazed at their unbelief.
Now He was going around the villages in
a circuit, teaching.
7 He summoned the Twelve and began
to send them out in pairs and gave them
authority over unclean spirits.
8 He instructed them to take nothing
for the road except a walking s ck: no
bread, no traveling bag, no money in
their belts.MARK 6
32
9 They were to wear sandals, but not
put on an extra shirt.
10 Then He said to them, "Whenever
you enter a house, stay there un l you
leave that place.
11 If any place does not welcome you
and people refuse to listen to you, when
you leave there, shake the dust oﬀ your
feet as a tes mony against them."
12 So they went out and preached that
people should repent.
13 And they were driving out many
demons, anoin ng many sick people
with oil, and healing.
14 King Herod heard of this, because
Jesus' name had become well known.
Some said, "John the Bap st has been
raised from the dead, and that's why
supernatural powers are at work in him."
15 But others said, "He's Elijah." S ll
others said, "He's a prophet--like one of
the prophets."MARK 6
33
16 When Herod heard of it, he said,
"John, the one I beheaded, has been
raised!"
17 For Herod himself had given orders
to arrest John and to chain him in prison
on account of Herodias, his brother
Philip's wife, whom he had married.
18 John had been telling Herod, "It is
not lawful for you to have your brother's
wife!"
19 So Herodias held a grudge against
him and wanted to kill him. But she
could not,
20 because Herod was in awe of John
and was protec ng him, knowing he was
a righteous and holy man. When Herod
heard him he would be very disturbed,
yet would hear him gladly.
21 Now an opportune me came on his
birthday, when Herod gave a banquet
for his nobles, military commanders, and
the leading men of Galilee.MARK 6
34
22 When Herodias' own daughter came
in and danced, she pleased Herod and
his guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask
me whatever you want, and I'll give it to
you."
23 So he swore oaths to her: "Whatever
you ask me I will give you, up to half my
kingdom."
24 Then she went out and said to her
mother, "What should I ask for?" "John
the Bap st's head!" she said.
25 Immediately she hurried to the king
and said, "I want you to give me John the
Bap st's head on a pla er--right now!"
26 Though the king was deeply
distressed, because of his oaths and the
guests he did not want to refuse her.
27 The king immediately sent for an
execu oner and commanded him to
bring John's head. So he went and
beheaded him in prison,MARK 6
28 brought his head on a pla
35
er, and
gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to
her mother.
29 When his disciples heard about it,
they came and removed his corpse and
placed it in a tomb.
30 The apostles gathered around Jesus
and reported to Him all that they had
done and taught.
31 He said to them, "Come away by
yourselves to a remote place and rest a
while." For many people were coming
and going, and they did not even have
me to eat.
32 So they went away in the boat by
themselves to a remote place,
33 but many saw them leaving and
recognized them. People ran there by
land from all the towns and arrived
ahead of them.
34 So as He stepped ashore, He saw
a huge crowd and had compassion onMARK 6
36
them, because they were like sheep
without a shepherd. Then He began to
teach them many things.
35 When it was already late, His disciples
approached Him and said, "This place is
a wilderness, and it is already late!
36 Send them away, so they can go into
the surrounding countryside and villages
to buy themselves something to eat."
37 "You give them something to eat,"
He responded. They said to Him, "Should
we go and buy 200 denarii worth of
bread and give them something to eat?"
38 And He asked them, "How many
loaves do you have? Go look." When
they found out they said, "Five, and two
ﬁsh."
39 Then He instructed them to have all
the people sit down in groups on the
green grass.
40 So they sat down in ranks of hundreds
and ﬁ ies.MARK 6
37
41 Then He took the ﬁve loaves and the
two ﬁsh, and looking up to heaven, He
blessed and broke the loaves. He kept
giving them to His disciples to set before
the people. He also divided the two ﬁsh
among them all.
42 Everyone ate and was ﬁlled.
43 Then they picked up 12 baskets full
of pieces of bread and ﬁsh.
44 Now those who ate the loaves were
5,000 men.
45 Immediately He made His disciples
get into the boat and go ahead of Him
to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He
dismissed the crowd.
46 A er He said good-bye to them, He
went away to the mountain to pray.
47 When evening came, the boat was in
the middle of the sea, and He was alone
on the land.
48 He saw them being ba ered as they
rowed, because the wind was againstMARK 6
38
them. Around three in the morning He
came toward them walking on the sea
and wanted to pass by them.
49 When they saw Him walking on the
sea, they thought it was a ghost and
cried out;
50 for they all saw Him and were
terriﬁed. Immediately He spoke with
them and said, "Have courage! It is I.
Don't be afraid."
51 Then He got into the boat with
them, and the wind ceased. They were
completely astounded,
52 because they had not understood
about the loaves. Instead, their hearts
were hardened.
53 When they had crossed over, they
came to land at Gennesaret and beached
the boat.
54 As they got out of the boat, people
immediately recognized Him.MARK 6 – 7
39
55 They hurried throughout that vicinity
and began to carry the sick on stretchers
to wherever they heard He was.
56 Wherever He would go, into villages,
towns, or the country, they laid the sick
in the marketplaces and begged Him
that they might touch just the tassel of
His robe. And everyone who touched it
was made well.
1 The Pharisees and some of
the scribes who had come from
Jerusalem gathered around Him.
2 They observed that some of His
disciples were ea ng their bread with
unclean--that is, unwashed--hands.
3 (For the Pharisees, in fact all the Jews,
will not eat unless they wash their hands
ritually, keeping the tradi on of the
elders.
4 When they come from the
marketplace, they do not eat unless they
have washed. And there are many other
7MARK 7
40
customs they have received and keep,
like the washing of cups, jugs, copper
utensils, and dining couches.)
5 Then the Pharisees and the scribes
asked Him, "Why don't Your disciples live
according to the tradi on of the elders,
instead of ea ng bread with ritually
unclean hands?"
6 He answered them, "Isaiah prophesied
correctly about you hypocrites, as it is
wri en: These people honor Me with
their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
7 They worship Me in vain, teaching as
doctrines the commands of men.
8 Disregarding the command of God,
you keep the tradi on of men."
9 He also said to them, "You completely
invalidate God's command in order to
maintain your tradi on!
10 For Moses said: Honor your father
and your mother; and, Whoever speaksMARK 7
41
evil of father or mother must be put to
death.
11 But you say, 'If a man tells his father
or mother: Whatever beneﬁt you might
have received from me is Corban'" (that
is, a gi commi ed to the temple ),
12 "you no longer let him do anything
for his father or mother.
13 You revoke God's word by your
tradi on that you have handed down.
And you do many other similar things."
14 Summoning the crowd again, He
told them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and
understand:
15 Nothing that goes into a person from
outside can deﬁle him, but the things
that come out of a person are what
deﬁle him.
16 If anyone has ears to hear, he should
listen!"MARK 7
42
17 When He went into the house away
from the crowd, the disciples asked Him
about the parable.
18 And He said to them, "Are you also
as lacking in understanding? Don't you
realize that nothing going into a man
from the outside can deﬁle him?
19 For it doesn't go into his heart but
into the stomach and is eliminated." (As
a result, He made all foods clean.)
20 Then He said, "What comes out of a
person--that deﬁles him.
21 For from within, out of people's
hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual
immorali es, the s, murders,
22 adulteries, greed, evil ac ons, deceit,
lewdness, s nginess, blasphemy, pride,
and foolishness.
23 All these evil things come from within
and deﬁle a person."
24 He got up and departed from there to
the region of Tyre and Sidon. He enteredMARK 7
43
a house and did not want anyone to
know it, but He could not escape no ce.
25 Instead, immediately a er hearing
about Him, a woman whose li le
daughter had an unclean spirit came and
fell at His feet.
26 Now the woman was Greek, a
Syrophoenician by birth, and she kept
asking Him to drive the demon out of
her daughter.
27 He said to her, "Allow the children to
be sa sﬁed ﬁrst, because it isn't right to
take the children's bread and throw it to
the dogs."
28 But she replied to Him, "Lord,
even the dogs under the table eat the
children's crumbs."
29 Then He told her, "Because of this
reply, you may go. The demon has gone
out of your daughter."MARK 7
44
30 When she went back to her home,
she found her child lying on the bed, and
the demon was gone.
31 Again, leaving the region of Tyre,
He went by way of Sidon to the Sea
of Galilee, through the region of the
Decapolis.
32 They brought to Him a deaf man who
also had a speech diﬃculty, and begged
Jesus to lay His hand on him.
33 So He took him away from the crowd
privately. A er pu ng His ﬁngers in the
man's ears and spi ng, He touched his
tongue.
34 Then, looking up to heaven, He sighed
deeply and said to him, "Ephphatha!"
(that is, "Be opened!").
35 Immediately his ears were opened,
his speech diﬃculty was removed, and
he began to speak clearly.MARK 7 – 8
45
36 Then He ordered them to tell no one,
but the more He would order them, the
more they would proclaim it.
37 They were extremely astonished
and said, "He has done everything well!
He even makes deaf people hear, and
people unable to speak, talk!"
1 In those days there was again a
large crowd, and they had nothing
to eat. He summoned the disciples and
said to them,
2 "I have compassion on the crowd,
because they've already stayed with Me
three days and have nothing to eat.
3 If I send them home famished, they
will collapse on the way, and some of
them have come a long distance."
4 His disciples answered Him, "Where
can anyone get enough bread here in
this desolate place to ﬁll these people?"
5 "How many loaves do you have?" He
asked them. "Seven," they said.
8MARK 8
46
6 Then He commanded the crowd to sit
down on the ground. Taking the seven
loaves, He gave thanks, broke the loaves
, and kept on giving them to His disciples
to set before the people . So they served
the loaves to the crowd.
7 They also had a few small ﬁsh, and
when He had blessed them, He said
these were to be served as well.
8 They ate and were ﬁlled. Then they
collected seven large baskets of le over
pieces.
9 About 4,000 men were there. He
dismissed them
10 and immediately got into the boat
with His disciples and went to the district
of Dalmanutha.
11 The Pharisees came out and began
to argue with Him, demanding of Him a
sign from heaven to test Him.
12 But sighing deeply in His spirit, He
said, "Why does this genera on demandMARK 8
47
a sign? I assure you: No sign will be given
to this genera on!"
13 Then He le them, got on board the
boat again, and went to the other side.
14 They had forgo en to take bread and
had only one loaf with them in the boat.
15 Then he commanded them: "Watch
out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees
and the yeast of Herod."
16 They were discussing among
themselves that they did not have any
bread.
17 Aware of this, He said to them, "Why
are you discussing that you do not have
any bread? Do you not yet understand or
comprehend? Is your heart hardened?
18 Do you have eyes, and not see, and
do you have ears, and not hear? And do
you not remember?
19 When I broke the ﬁve loaves for the
5,000, how many baskets full of piecesMARK 8
48
of bread did you collect?" "Twelve," they
told Him.
20 "When I broke the seven loaves for
the 4,000, how many large baskets full
of pieces of bread did you collect?"
"Seven," they said.
21 And He said to them, "Don't you
understand yet?"
22 Then they came to Bethsaida. They
brought a blind man to Him and begged
Him to touch him.
23 He took the blind man by the hand
and brought him out of the village.
Spi ng on his eyes and laying His hands
on him, He asked him, "Do you see
anything?"
24 He looked up and said, "I see
people--they look to me like trees
walking."
25 Again Jesus placed His hands on the
man's eyes, and he saw dis nctly. HeMARK 8
49
was cured and could see everything
clearly.
26 Then He sent him home, saying,
"Don't even go into the village."
27 Jesus went out with His disciples to
the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on
the road He asked His disciples, "Who do
people say that I am?"
28 They answered Him, "John the
Bap st; others, Elijah; s ll others, one of
the prophets."
29 "But you," He asked them again,
"who do you say that I am?" Peter
answered Him, "You are the Messiah!"
30 And He strictly warned them to tell
no one about Him.
31 Then He began to teach them that
the Son of Man must suﬀer many things,
and be rejected by the elders, the chief
priests, and the scribes, be killed, and
rise a er three days.MARK 8
50
32 He was openly talking about this.
So Peter took Him aside and began to
rebuke Him.
33 But turning around and looking at
His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said,
"Get behind Me, Satan, because you're
not thinking about God's concerns, but
man's!"
34 Summoning the crowd along with His
disciples, He said to them, "If anyone
wants to be My follower, he must deny
himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.
35 For whoever wants to save his life
will lose it, but whoever loses his life
because of Me and the gospel will save
it.
36 For what does it beneﬁt a man to
gain the whole world yet lose his life?
37 What can a man give in exchange for
his life?
38 For whoever is ashamed of Me and
of My words in this adulterous and sinfulMARK 9
51
genera on, the Son of Man will also be
ashamed of him when He comes in the
glory of His Father with the holy angels."
1 Then He said to them, "I assure
you: There are some standing here
who will not taste death un l they see
the kingdom of God come in power."
2 A er six days Jesus took Peter, James,
and John and led them up on a high
mountain by themselves to be alone. He
was transformed in front of them,
3 and His clothes became dazzling--
extremely white as no launderer on
earth could whiten them.
4 Elijah appeared to them with Moses,
and they were talking with Jesus.
5 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it
is good for us to be here! Let us make
three tabernacles: one for You, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah"--
6 because he did not know what he
should say, since they were terriﬁed.
9MARK 9
52
7 A cloud appeared, overshadowing
them, and a voice came from the cloud:
This is My beloved Son; listen to Him!
8 Then suddenly, looking around, they
no longer saw anyone with them except
Jesus alone.
9 As they were coming down from the
mountain, He ordered them to tell no
one what they had seen un l the Son of
Man had risen from the dead.
10 They kept this word to themselves,
discussing what "rising from the dead"
meant.
11 Then they began to ques on Him,
"Why do the scribes say that Elijah must
come ﬁrst?"
12 "Elijah does come ﬁrst and restores
everything," He replied. "How then is it
wri en about the Son of Man that He
must suﬀer many things and be treated
with contempt?MARK 9
53
13 But I tell you that Elijah really has
come, and they did to him whatever
they wanted, just as it is wri en about
him."
14 When they came to the disciples,
they saw a large crowd around them and
scribes dispu ng with them.
15 All of a sudden, when the whole
crowd saw Him, they were amazed and
ran to greet Him.
16 Then He asked them, "What are you
arguing with them about?"
17 Out of the crowd, one man answered
Him, "Teacher, I brought my son to You.
He has a spirit that makes him unable to
speak.
18 Wherever it seizes him, it throws
him down, and he foams at the mouth,
grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I
asked Your disciples to drive it out, but
they couldn't."MARK 9
54
19 He replied to them, "You unbelieving
genera on! How long will I be with you?
How long must I put up with you? Bring
him to Me."
20 So they brought him to Him. When
the spirit saw Him, it immediately
convulsed the boy. He fell to the ground
and rolled around, foaming at the
mouth.
21 "How long has this been happening
to him?" Jesus asked his father. "From
childhood," he said.
22 "And many mes it has thrown him
into ﬁre or water to destroy him. But if
You can do anything, have compassion
on us and help us."
23 Then Jesus said to him, "'If You can?'
Everything is possible to the one who
believes."
24 Immediately the father of the
boy cried out, "I do believe! Help my
unbelief."MARK 9
55
25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was
rapidly coming together, He rebuked the
unclean spirit, saying to it, "You mute
and deaf spirit, I command you: come
out of him and never enter him again!"
26 Then it came out, shrieking and
convulsing him violently. The boy
became like a corpse, so that many said,
"He's dead."
27 But Jesus, taking him by the hand,
raised him, and he stood up.
28 A er He went into a house, His
disciples asked Him privately, "Why
couldn't we drive it out?"
29 And He told them, "This kind can
come out by nothing but prayer [and
fas ng]."
30 Then they le that place and made
their way through Galilee, but He did not
want anyone to know it.
31 For He was teaching His disciples and
telling them, "The Son of Man is beingMARK 9
56
betrayed into the hands of men. They
will kill Him, and a er He is killed, He will
rise three days later."
32 But they did not understand this
statement, and they were afraid to ask
Him.
33 Then they came to Capernaum.
When He was in the house, He asked
them, "What were you arguing about on
the way?"
34 But they were silent, because on the
way they had been arguing with one
another about who was the greatest.
35 Si ng down, He called the Twelve
and said to them, "If anyone wants to be
ﬁrst, he must be last of all and servant of
all."
36 Then He took a child, had him stand
among them, and taking him in His arms,
He said to them,
37 "Whoever welcomes one li le child
such as this in My name welcomes Me.MARK 9
57
And whoever welcomes Me does not
welcome Me, but Him who sent Me."
38 John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw
someone driving out demons in Your
name, and we tried to stop him because
he wasn't following us."
39 "Don't stop him," said Jesus,
"because there is no one who will
perform a miracle in My name who can
soon a erwards speak evil of Me.
40 For whoever is not against us is for
us.
41 And whoever gives you a cup of water
to drink because of My name, since you
belong to the Messiah--I assure you: He
will never lose his reward.
42 "But whoever causes the downfall of
one of these li le ones who believe in
Me--it would be be er for him if a heavy
millstone were hung around his neck
and he were thrown into the sea.MARK 9
58
43 And if your hand causes your
downfall, cut it oﬀ. It is be er for you
to enter life maimed than to have two
hands and go to hell--the unquenchable
ﬁre,
44 [where Their worm does not die, and
the ﬁre is not quenched. ]
45 And if your foot causes your downfall,
cut it oﬀ. It is be er for you to enter
life lame than to have two feet and be
thrown into hell--[the unquenchable
ﬁre,
46 where Their worm does not die, and
the ﬁre is not quenched. ]
47 And if your eye causes your downfall,
gouge it out. It is be er for you to enter
the kingdom of God with one eye than
to have two eyes and be thrown into
hell,
48 where Their worm does not die, and
the ﬁre is not quenched.
49 For everyone will be salted with ﬁre.MARK 9 – 10
59
50 Salt is good, but if the salt should
lose its ﬂavor, how can you make it salty?
Have salt among yourselves and be at
peace with one another."
1 He set out from there and went
to the region of Judea and across
the Jordan. Then crowds converged on
Him again and, as He usually did, He
began teaching them once more.
2 Some Pharisees approached Him to
test Him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a
man to divorce his wife?"
3 He replied to them, "What did Moses
command you?"
4 They said, "Moses permi ed us to
write divorce papers and send her away."
5 But Jesus told them, "He wrote this
commandment for you because of the
hardness of your hearts.
6 But from the beginning of crea on
God made them male and female.
10MARK 10
60
7 For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother [and be joined to his
wife,]
8 and the two will become one ﬂesh. So
they are no longer two, but one ﬂesh.
9 Therefore what God has joined
together, man must not separate."
10 Now in the house the disciples
ques oned Him again about this ma er.
11 And He said to them, "Whoever
divorces his wife and marries another
commits adultery against her.
12 Also, if she divorces her husband and
marries another, she commits adultery."
13 Some people were bringing li le
children to Him so He might touch them,
but His disciples rebuked them.
14 When Jesus saw it, He was indignant
and said to them, "Let the li le children
come to Me. Don't stop them, for the
kingdom of God belongs to such as
these.MARK 10
61
15 I assure you: Whoever does not
welcome the kingdom of God like a li le
child will never enter it."
16 A er taking them in His arms, He laid
His hands on them and blessed them.
17 As He was se ng out on a journey, a
man ran up, knelt down before Him, and
asked Him, "Good Teacher, what must I
do to inherit eternal life?"
18 "Why do you call Me good?"
Jesus asked him. "No one is good but
One--God.
19 You know the commandments: Do
not murder; do not commit adultery;
do not steal; do not bear false witness;
do not defraud; honor your father and
mother. "
20 He said to Him, "Teacher, I have kept
all these from my youth."
21 Then, looking at him, Jesus loved him
and said to him, "You lack one thing: Go,
sell all you have and give to the poor,MARK 10
62
and you will have treasure in heaven.
Then come, follow Me."
22 But he was stunned at this demand,
and he went away grieving, because he
had many possessions.
23 Jesus looked around and said to His
disciples, "How hard it is for those who
have wealth to enter the kingdom of
God!"
24 But the disciples were astonished
at His words. Again Jesus said to them,
"Children, how hard it is to enter the
kingdom of God!
25 It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich person
to enter the kingdom of God."
26 So they were even more astonished,
saying to one another, "Then who can be
saved?"
27 Looking at them, Jesus said, "With
men it is impossible, but not with God,MARK 10
63
because all things are possible with
God."
28 Peter began to tell Him, "Look, we
have le everything and followed You."
29 "I assure you," Jesus said, "there is
no one who has le house, brothers or
sisters, mother or father, children, or
ﬁelds because of Me and the gospel,
30 who will not receive 100 mes more,
now at this me--houses, brothers and
sisters, mothers and children, and ﬁelds,
with persecu ons--and eternal life in the
age to come.
31 But many who are ﬁrst will be last,
and the last ﬁrst."
32 They were on the road, going up
to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking
ahead of them. They were astonished,
but those who followed Him were
afraid. Taking the Twelve aside again, He
began to tell them the things that would
happen to Him.MARK 10
64
33 "Listen! We are going up to
Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be
handed over to the chief priests and the
scribes, and they will condemn Him to
death. Then they will hand Him over to
the Gen les,
34 and they will mock Him, spit on Him,
ﬂog Him, and kill Him, and He will rise
a er three days."
35 Then James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, approached Him and said,
"Teacher, we want You to do something
for us if we ask You."
36 "What do you want Me to do for
you?" He asked them.
37 They answered Him, "Allow us to
sit at Your right and at Your le in Your
glory."
38 But Jesus said to them, "You don't
know what you're asking. Are you able
to drink the cup I drink or to be bap zed
with the bap sm I am bap zed with?"MARK 10
65
39 "We are able," they told Him. Jesus
said to them, "You will drink the cup I
drink, and you will be bap zed with the
bap sm I am bap zed with.
40 But to sit at My right or le is not
Mine to give; instead, it is for those it
has been prepared for."
41 When the other 10 disciples heard
this, they began to be indignant with
James and John.
42 Jesus called them over and said
to them, "You know that those who
are regarded as rulers of the Gen les
dominate them, and their men of high
posi ons exercise power over them.
43 But it must not be like that among
you. On the contrary, whoever wants to
become great among you must be your
servant,
44 and whoever wants to be ﬁrst among
you must be a slave to all.MARK 10
66
45 For even the Son of Man did not
come to be served, but to serve, and to
give His life--a ransom for many."
46 They came to Jericho. And as He was
leaving Jericho with His disciples and
a large crowd, Bar maeus (the son of
Timaeus), a blind beggar, was si ng by
the road.
47 When he heard that it was Jesus the
Nazarene, he began to cry out, "Son of
David, Jesus, have mercy on me!"
48 Many people told him to keep quiet,
but he was crying out all the more,
"Have mercy on me, Son of David!"
49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."
So they called the blind man and said to
him, "Have courage! Get up; He's calling
for you."
50 He threw oﬀ his coat, jumped up,
and came to Jesus.MARK 10 – 11
67
51 Then Jesus answered him, "What do
you want Me to do for you?" "Rabbouni,"
the blind man told Him, "I want to see!"
52 "Go your way," Jesus told him. "Your
faith has healed you." Immediately he
could see and began to follow Him on
the road.
1 When they approached
Jerusalem, at Bethphage and
Bethany near the Mount of Olives, He
sent two of His disciples
2 and told them, "Go into the village
ahead of you. As soon as you enter it,
you will ﬁnd a young donkey ed there,
on which no one has ever sat. Un e it
and bring it here.
3 If anyone says to you, 'Why are you
doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and
will send it back here right away.'"
4 So they went and found a young
donkey outside in the street, ed by a
door. They un ed it,
11MARK 11
68
5 and some of those standing there said
to them, "What are you doing, untying
the donkey?"
6 They answered them just as Jesus had
said, so they let them go.
7 Then they brought the donkey to
Jesus and threw their robes on it, and He
sat on it.
8 Many people spread their robes
on the road, and others spread leafy
branches cut from the ﬁelds.
9 Then those who went ahead and
those who followed kept shou ng:
Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in
the name of the Lord!
10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our
father David! Hosanna in the highest
heaven!
11 And He went into Jerusalem and
into the temple complex. A er looking
around at everything, since it wasMARK 11
69
already late, He went out to Bethany
with the Twelve.
12 The next day when they came out
from Bethany, He was hungry.
13 A er seeing in the distance a ﬁg tree
with leaves, He went to ﬁnd out if there
was anything on it. When He came to it,
He found nothing but leaves, because it
was not the season for ﬁgs.
14 He said to it, "May no one ever eat
fruit from you again!" And His disciples
heard it.
15 They came to Jerusalem, and He
went into the temple complex and began
to throw out those buying and selling in
the temple. He overturned the money
changers' tables and the chairs of those
selling doves,
16 and would not permit anyone to carry
goods through the temple complex.
17 Then He began to teach them: "Is it
not wri en, My house will be called aMARK 11
70
house of prayer for all na ons ? But you
have made it a den of thieves !"
18 Then the chief priests and the scribes
heard it and started looking for a way
to destroy Him. For they were afraid
of Him, because the whole crowd was
astonished by His teaching.
19 And whenever evening came, they
would go out of the city.
20 Early in the morning, as they were
passing by, they saw the ﬁg tree withered
from the roots up.
21 Then Peter remembered and said to
Him, "Rabbi, look! The ﬁg tree that You
cursed is withered."
22 Jesus replied to them, "Have faith in
God.
23 I assure you: If anyone says to this
mountain, 'Be li ed up and thrown
into the sea,' and does not doubt in his
heart, but believes that what he says will
happen, it will be done for him.MARK 11
71
24 Therefore, I tell you, all the things
you pray and ask for--believe that you
have received them, and you will have
them.
25 And whenever you stand praying,
if you have anything against anyone,
forgive him, so that your Father in
heaven will also forgive you your
wrongdoing.
26 [But if you don't forgive, neither
will your Father in heaven forgive your
wrongdoing."]
27 They came again to Jerusalem. As He
was walking in the temple complex, the
chief priests, the scribes, and the elders
came and asked Him,
28 "By what authority are You doing
these things? Who gave You this
authority to do these things?"
29 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one
ques on; then answer Me, and I will tellMARK 11 – 12
72
you by what authority I am doing these
things.
30 Was John's bap sm from heaven or
from men? Answer Me."
31 They began to argue among
themselves: "If we say, 'From heaven,'
He will say, 'Then why didn't you believe
him?'
32 But if we say, 'From men'"--they
were afraid of the crowd, because
everyone thought that John was a
genuine prophet.
33 So they answered Jesus, "We don't
know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither
will I tell you by what authority I do
these things."
1 Then He began to speak to them
in parables: "A man planted a
vineyard, put a fence around it, dug
out a pit for a winepress, and built a
watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant
farmers and went away.
12MARK 12
2 At harvest
73
me he sent a slave to the
farmers to collect some of the fruit of
the vineyard from the farmers.
3 But they took him, beat him, and sent
him away empty-handed.
4 Again he sent another slave to them,
and they hit him on the head and treated
him shamefully.
5 Then he sent another, and they killed
that one. He also sent many others; they
beat some and they killed some.
6 "He s ll had one to send, a beloved
son. Finally he sent him to them, saying,
'They will respect my son.'
7 "But those tenant farmers said among
themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's
kill him, and the inheritance will be
ours!'
8 So they seized him, killed him, and
threw him out of the vineyard.
9 "Therefore, what will the owner of the
vineyard do? He will come and destroyMARK 12
74
the farmers and give the vineyard to
others.
10 Haven't you read this Scripture: The
stone that the builders rejected--this has
become the cornerstone.
11 This came from the Lord and is
wonderful in our eyes ?"
12 Because they knew He had said this
parable against them, they were looking
for a way to arrest Him, but they were
afraid of the crowd. So they le Him and
went away.
13 Then they sent some of the Pharisees
and the Herodians to Him to trap Him by
what He said.
14 When they came, they said to Him,
"Teacher, we know You are truthful and
defer to no one, for You don't show
par ality but teach truthfully the way of
God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or
not?MARK 12
75
15 Should we pay, or should we not
pay?" But knowing their hypocrisy, He
said to them, "Why are you tes ng Me?
Bring Me a denarius to look at."
16 So they brought one. "Whose image
and inscrip on is this?" He asked them.
"Caesar's," they said.
17 Then Jesus told them, "Give back to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and
to God the things that are God's." And
they were amazed at Him.
18 Some Sadducees, who say there
is no resurrec on, came to Him and
ques oned Him:
19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if
a man's brother dies , leaves his wife
behind, and leaves no child, his brother
should take the wife and produce
oﬀspring for his brother.
20 There were seven brothers. The ﬁrst
took a wife, and dying, le no oﬀspring.MARK 12
76
21 The second also took her, and he
died, leaving no oﬀspring. And the third
likewise.
22 The seven also le no oﬀspring. Last
of all, the woman died too.
23 In the resurrec on, when they rise,
whose wife will she be, since the seven
had married her?"
24 Jesus told them, "Are you not
deceived because you don't know the
Scriptures or the power of God?
25 For when they rise from the dead,
they neither marry nor are given in
marriage but are like angels in heaven.
26 Now concerning the dead being
raised--haven't you read in the book of
Moses, in the passage about the burning
bush, how God spoke to him: I am the
God of Abraham and the God of Isaac
and the God of Jacob ?
27 He is not God of the dead but of the
living. You are badly deceived."MARK 12
77
28 One of the scribes approached.
When he heard them deba ng and saw
that Jesus answered them well, he asked
Him, "Which commandment is the most
important of all?"
29 "This is the most important," Jesus
answered: Listen, Israel! The Lord our
God, The Lord is One.
30 Love the Lord your God with all your
heart, with all your soul, with all your
mind, and with all your strength.
31 "The second is: Love your
neighbor as yourself. There is no
other commandment greater than
these."
32 Then the scribe said to Him, "You are
right, Teacher! You have correctly said
that He is One, and there is no one else
except Him.
33 And to love Him with all your heart,
with all your understanding, and with all
your strength, and to love your neighborMARK 12
78
as yourself, is far more important than
all the burnt oﬀerings and sacriﬁces."
34 When Jesus saw that he answered
intelligently, He said to him, "You are not
far from the kingdom of God." And no
one dared to ques on Him any longer.
35 So Jesus asked this ques on as He
taught in the temple complex, "How can
the scribes say that the Messiah is the
Son of David?
36 David himself says by the Holy Spirit:
The Lord declared to my Lord, 'Sit at
My right hand un l I put Your enemies
under Your feet.'
37 David himself calls Him 'Lord'; how
then can the Messiah be his Son?" And
the large crowd was listening to Him
with delight.
38 He also said in His teaching, "Beware
of the scribes, who want to go around in
long robes, and who want gree ngs in
the marketplaces,MARK 12 – 13
79
39 the front seats in the synagogues,
and the places of honor at banquets.
40 They devour widows' houses and say
long prayers just for show. These will
receive harsher punishment."
41 Si ng across from the temple
treasury, He watched how the crowd
dropped money into the treasury. Many
rich people were pu ng in large sums.
42 And a poor widow came and dropped
in two ny coins worth very li le.
43 Summoning His disciples, He said to
them, "I assure you: This poor widow
has put in more than all those giving to
the temple treasury.
44 For they all gave out of their surplus,
but she out of her poverty has put in
everything she possessed--all she had to
live on."
1 As He was going out of the
temple complex, one of His
disciples said to Him, "Teacher, look!
13MARK 13
80
What massive stones! What impressive
buildings!"
2 Jesus said to him, "Do you see these
great buildings? Not one stone will be
le here on another that will not be
thrown down!"
3 While He was si ng on the Mount of
Olives across from the temple complex,
Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked
Him privately,
4 "Tell us, when will these things
happen? And what will be the sign when
all these things are about to take place?"
5 Then Jesus began by telling them:
"Watch out that no one deceives you.
6 Many will come in My name, saying, 'I
am He,' and they will deceive many.
7 When you hear of wars and rumors
of wars, don't be alarmed; these things
must take place, but the end is not yet.
8 For na on will rise up against na on,
and kingdom against kingdom. ThereMARK 13
81
will be earthquakes in various places,
and famines. These are the beginning of
birth pains.
9 "But you, be on your guard! They will
hand you over to sanhedrins, and you
will be ﬂogged in the synagogues. You
will stand before governors and kings
because of Me, as a witness to them.
10 And the good news must ﬁrst be
proclaimed to all na ons.
11 So when they arrest you and hand
you over, don't worry beforehand what
you will say. On the contrary, whatever
is given to you in that hour--say it. For it
isn't you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
12 Then brother will betray brother to
death, and a father his child. Children
will rise up against parents and put them
to death.
13 And you will be hated by everyone
because of My name. But the one who
endures to the end will be delivered.MARK 13
14 "When you see the abomina
82
on
that causes desola on standing where it
should not" (let the reader understand),
"then those in Judea must ﬂee to the
mountains!
15 A man on the housetop must not
come down or go in to get anything out
of his house.
16 And a man in the ﬁeld must not go
back to get his clothes.
17 Woe to pregnant women and nursing
mothers in those days!
18 Pray it won't happen in winter.
19 For those will be days of tribula on,
the kind that hasn't been from the
beginning of the world, which God
created, un l now and never will be
again!
20 Unless the Lord limited those days,
no one would survive. But He limited
those days because of the elect, whom
He chose.MARK 13
83
21 "Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here
is the Messiah! Look--there!' do not
believe it!
22 For false messiahs and false prophets
will rise up and will perform signs and
wonders to lead astray, if possible, the
elect.
23 And you must watch! I have told you
everything in advance.
24 "But in those days, a er that
tribula on: The sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not shed its light;
25 the stars will be falling from the sky,
and the celes al powers will be shaken.
26 Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in clouds with great power and
glory.
27 He will send out the angels and
gather His elect from the four winds,
from the end of the earth to the end of
the sky.MARK 13
84
28 "Learn this parable from the ﬁg tree:
As soon as its branch becomes tender
and sprouts leaves, you know that
summer is near.
29 In the same way, when you see
these things happening, know that He is
near--at the door!
30 I assure you: This genera on will
certainly not pass away un l all these
things take place.
31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but
My words will never pass away.
32 "Now concerning that day or hour no
one knows--neither the angels in heaven
nor the Son--except the Father.
33 Watch! Be alert! For you don't know
when the me is coming .
34 It is like a man on a journey, who
le his house, gave authority to his
slaves, gave each one his work, and
commanded the doorkeeper to be alert.MARK 13 – 14
85
35 Therefore be alert, since you don't
know when the master of the house is
coming--whether in the evening or at
midnight or at the crowing of the rooster
or early in the morning.
36 Otherwise, he might come suddenly
and ﬁnd you sleeping.
37 And what I say to you, I say to
everyone: Be alert!"
1 A er two days it was the
Passover and the Fes val of
Unleavened Bread. The chief priests
and the scribes were looking for a
treacherous way to arrest and kill Him.
2 "Not during the fes val," they said,
"or there may be rio ng among the
people."
3 While He was in Bethany at the house
of Simon who had a serious skin disease,
as He was reclining at the table, a woman
came with an alabaster jar of pure and
14MARK 14
86
expensive fragrant oil of nard. She broke
the jar and poured it on His head.
4 But some were expressing indigna on
to one another: "Why has this fragrant
oil been wasted?
5 For this oil might have been sold for
more than 300 denarii and given to the
poor." And they began to scold her.
6 Then Jesus said, "Leave her alone.
Why are you bothering her? She has
done a noble thing for Me.
7 You always have the poor with you,
and you can do good for them whenever
you want, but you do not always have
Me.
8 She has done what she could; she has
anointed My body in advance for burial.
9 I assure you: Wherever the gospel is
proclaimed in the whole world, what
this woman has done will also be told in
memory of her."MARK 14
87
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the
Twelve, went to the chief priests to hand
Him over to them.
11 And when they heard this, they
were glad and promised to give him
silver. So he started looking for a good
opportunity to betray Him.
12 On the ﬁrst day of Unleavened Bread,
when they sacriﬁce the Passover lamb,
His disciples asked Him, "Where do You
want us to go and prepare the Passover
so You may eat it?"
13 So He sent two of His disciples and
told them, "Go into the city, and a man
carrying a water jug will meet you.
Follow him.
14 Wherever he enters, tell the owner
of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where
is the guest room for Me to eat the
Passover with My disciples?"'MARK 14
88
15 He will show you a large room
upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the
prepara ons for us there."
16 So the disciples went out, entered
the city, and found it just as He had told
them, and they prepared the Passover.
17 When evening came, He arrived with
the Twelve.
18 While they were reclining and ea ng,
Jesus said, "I assure you: One of you will
betray Me--one who is ea ng with Me!"
19 They began to be distressed and to
say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?"
20 He said to them, "It is one of the
Twelve--the one who is dipping bread
with Me in the bowl.
21 For the Son of Man will go just as it is
wri en about Him, but woe to that man
by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It
would have been be er for that man if
he had not been born."MARK 14
22 As they were ea
89
ng, He took bread,
blessed and broke it, gave it to them,
and said, "Take it ; this is My body."
23 Then He took a cup, and a er giving
thanks, He gave it to them, and so they
all drank from it.
24 He said to them, "This is My blood
that establishes the covenant; it is shed
for many.
25 I assure you: I will no longer drink of
the fruit of the vine un l that day when I
drink it in a new way in the kingdom of
God."
26 A er singing psalms, they went out
to the Mount of Olives.
27 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you
will run away, because it is wri en: I will
strike the shepherd, and the sheep will
be sca ered.
28 But a er I have been resurrected, I
will go ahead of you to Galilee."MARK 14
90
29 Peter told Him, "Even if everyone
runs away, I will certainly not!"
30 "I assure you," Jesus said to him,
"today, this very night, before the
rooster crows twice, you will deny Me
three mes!"
31 But he kept insis ng, "If I have to die
with You, I will never deny You!" And
they all said the same thing.
32 Then they came to a place named
Gethsemane, and He told His disciples,
"Sit here while I pray."
33 He took Peter, James, and John
with Him, and He began to be deeply
distressed and horriﬁed.
34 Then He said to them, "My soul is
swallowed up in sorrow--to the point of
death. Remain here and stay awake."
35 Then He went a li le farther, fell to
the ground, and began to pray that if it
were possible, the hour might pass from
Him.MARK 14
91
36 And He said, "Abba, Father! All things
are possible for You. Take this cup away
from Me. Nevertheless, not what I will,
but what You will."
37 Then He came and found them
sleeping. "Simon, are you sleeping?" He
asked Peter. "Couldn't you stay awake
one hour?
38 Stay awake and pray so that you
won't enter into tempta on. The spirit is
willing, but the ﬂesh is weak."
39 Once again He went away and
prayed, saying the same thing.
40 And He came again and found them
sleeping, because they could not keep
their eyes open. They did not know what
to say to Him.
41 Then He came a third me and said
to them, "Are you s ll sleeping and
res ng? Enough! The me has come.
Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed
into the hands of sinners.MARK 14
92
42 Get up; let's go! See--My betrayer is
near."
43 While He was s ll speaking, Judas,
one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived.
With him was a mob, with swords and
clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes,
and the elders.
44 His betrayer had given them a signal.
"The One I kiss," he said, "He's the One;
arrest Him and take Him away under
guard."
45 So when he came, he went right up
to Him and said, "Rabbi!"--and kissed
Him.
46 Then they took hold of Him and
arrested Him.
47 And one of those who stood by drew
his sword, struck the high priest's slave,
and cut oﬀ his ear.
48 But Jesus said to them, "Have you
come out with swords and clubs, as
though I were a criminal, to capture Me?MARK 14
93
49 Every day I was among you, teaching
in the temple complex, and you didn't
arrest Me. But the Scriptures must be
fulﬁlled."
50 Then they all deserted Him and ran
away.
51 Now a certain young man, having a
linen cloth wrapped around his naked
body, was following Him. They caught
hold of him,
52 but he le the linen cloth behind and
ran away naked.
53 They led Jesus away to the high
priest, and all the chief priests, the
elders, and the scribes convened.
54 Peter followed Him at a distance,
right into the high priest's courtyard.
He was si ng with the temple police,
warming himself by the ﬁre.
55 The chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were looking for tes monyMARK 14
94
against Jesus to put Him to death, but
they could ﬁnd none.
56 For many were giving false tes mony
against Him, but the tes monies did not
agree.
57 Some stood up and were giving false
tes mony against Him, sta ng,
58 "We heard Him say, 'I will demolish
this sanctuary made by human hands,
and in three days I will build another not
made by hands.'"
59 Yet their tes mony did not agree
even on this.
60 Then the high priest stood up before
them all and ques oned Jesus, "Don't
You have an answer to what these men
are tes fying against You?"
61 But He kept silent and did not
answer anything. Again the high priest
ques oned Him, "Are You the Messiah,
the Son of the Blessed One?"MARK 14
95
62 "I am," said Jesus, "and all of you will
see the Son of Man seated at the right
hand of the Power and coming with the
clouds of heaven ."
63 Then the high priest tore his robes
and said, "Why do we s ll need
witnesses?
64 You have heard the blasphemy!
What is your decision?" And they all
condemned Him to be deserving of
death.
65 Then some began to spit on Him, to
blindfold Him, and to beat Him, saying,
"Prophesy!" Even the temple police took
Him and slapped Him.
66 While Peter was in the courtyard
below, one of the high priest's servants
came.
67 When she saw Peter warming
himself, she looked at him and said, "You
also were with that Nazarene, Jesus."MARK 14 – 15
96
68 But he denied it: "I don't know or
understand what you're talking about!"
Then he went out to the entryway, and a
rooster crowed.
69 When the servant saw him again
she began to tell those standing nearby,
"This man is one of them!"
70 But again he denied it. A er a li le
while those standing there said to Peter
again, "You certainly are one of them,
since you're also a Galilean!"
71 Then he started to curse and to
swear with an oath, "I don't know this
man you're talking about!"
72 Immediately a rooster crowed a
second me, and Peter remembered
when Jesus had spoken the word to him,
"Before the rooster crows twice, you will
deny Me three mes." When he thought
about it, he began to weep.
1 As soon as it was morning,
the chief priests had a mee ng
15MARK 15
97
with the elders, scribes, and the whole
Sanhedrin. A er tying Jesus up, they
led Him away and handed Him over to
Pilate.
2 So Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King
of the Jews?" He answered him, "You
have said it."
3 And the chief priests began to accuse
Him of many things.
4 Then Pilate ques oned Him again,
"Are You not answering anything? Look
how many things they are accusing You
of!"
5 But Jesus s ll did not answer anything,
so Pilate was amazed.
6 At the fes val it was Pilate's custom to
release for the people a prisoner they
requested.
7 There was one named Barabbas,
who was in prison with rebels who had
commi ed murder during the rebellion.MARK 15
98
8 The crowd came up and began to ask
Pilate to do for them as was his custom.
9 So Pilate answered them, "Do you
want me to release the King of the Jews
for you?"
10 For he knew it was because of envy
that the chief priests had handed Him
over.
11 But the chief priests s rred up the
crowd so that he would release Barabbas
to them instead.
12 Pilate asked them again, "Then what
do you want me to do with the One you
call the King of the Jews?"
13 Again they shouted, "Crucify Him!"
14 Then Pilate said to them, "Why?
What has He done wrong?" But they
shouted, "Crucify Him!" all the more.
15 Then, willing to gra fy the crowd,
Pilate released Barabbas to them. And
a er having Jesus ﬂogged, he handed
Him over to be cruciﬁed.MARK 15
99
16 Then the soldiers led Him away into
the courtyard (that is, headquarters) and
called the whole company together.
17 They dressed Him in a purple robe,
twisted together a crown of thorns, and
put it on Him.
18 And they began to salute Him, "Hail,
King of the Jews!"
19 They kept hi ng Him on the head
with a reed and spi ng on Him. Ge ng
down on their knees, they were paying
Him homage.
20 When they had mocked Him, they
stripped Him of the purple robe, put
His clothes on Him, and led Him out to
crucify Him.
21 They forced a man coming in from
the country, who was passing by, to carry
Jesus' cross. He was Simon, a Cyrenian,
the father of Alexander and Rufus.MARK 15
100
22 And they brought Jesus to the place
called Golgotha (which means Skull
Place).
23 They tried to give Him wine mixed
with myrrh, but He did not take it.
24 Then they cruciﬁed Him and divided
His clothes, cas ng lots for them to
decide what each would get.
25 Now it was nine in the morning when
they cruciﬁed Him.
26 The inscrip on of the charge wri en
against Him was THE KING OF THE JEWS
27 They cruciﬁed two criminals with
Him, one on His right and one on His le .
28 [So the Scripture was fulﬁlled that
says: And He was counted among
outlaws. ]
29 Those who passed by were yelling
insults at Him, shaking their heads,
and saying, "Ha! The One who would
demolish the sanctuary and build it in
three days,MARK 15
101
30 save Yourself by coming down from
the cross!"
31 In the same way, the chief priests
with the scribes were mocking Him
to one another and saying, "He saved
others; He cannot save Himself!
32 Let the Messiah, the King of Israel,
come down now from the cross, so
that we may see and believe." Even
those who were cruciﬁed with Him were
taun ng Him.
33 When it was noon, darkness came
over the whole land un l three in the
a ernoon.
34 And at three Jesus cried out with a
loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lemá sabachtháni?
" which is translated, "My God, My God,
why have You forsaken Me? "
35 When some of those standing there
heard this, they said, "Look, He's calling
for Elijah!"MARK 15
102
36 Someone ran and ﬁlled a sponge with
sour wine, ﬁxed it on a reed, oﬀered
Him a drink, and said, "Let's see if Elijah
comes to take Him down!"
37 But Jesus let out a loud cry and
breathed His last.
38 Then the curtain of the sanctuary
was split in two from top to bo om.
39 When the centurion, who was
standing opposite Him, saw the way He
breathed His last, he said, "This man
really was God's Son!"
40 There were also women looking on
from a distance. Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James
the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41 When He was in Galilee, they would
follow Him and help Him. Many other
women had come up with Him to
Jerusalem.MARK 15
103
42 When it was already evening,
because it was prepara on day (that is,
the day before the Sabbath),
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent
member of the Sanhedrin who was
himself looking forward to the kingdom
of God, came and boldly went in to Pilate
and asked for Jesus' body.
44 Pilate was surprised that He was
already dead. Summoning the centurion,
he asked him whether He had already
died.
45 When he found out from the
centurion, he gave the corpse to Joseph.
46 A er he bought some ﬁne linen, he
took Him down and wrapped Him in the
linen. Then he placed Him in a tomb
cut out of the rock, and rolled a stone
against the entrance to the tomb.
47 Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Joses were watching where
He was placed.MARK 16
16
104
1 When the Sabbath was over,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the
mother of James, and Salome bought
spices, so they could go and anoint Him.
2 Very early in the morning, on the ﬁrst
day of the week, they went to the tomb
at sunrise.
3 They were saying to one another,
"Who will roll away the stone from the
entrance to the tomb for us?"
4 Looking up, they observed that the
stone--which was very large--had been
rolled away.
5 When they entered the tomb, they
saw a young man dressed in a long white
robe si ng on the right side; they were
amazed and alarmed.
6 "Don't be alarmed," he told them.
"You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene,
who was cruciﬁed. He has been
resurrected! He is not here! See the
place where they put Him.MARK 16
105
7 But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He
is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will
see Him there just as He told you.'"
8 So they went out and started running
from the tomb, because trembling and
astonishment overwhelmed them. And
they said nothing to anyone, since they
were afraid.
9 [Early on the ﬁrst day of the week,
a er He had risen, He appeared ﬁrst to
Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had
driven seven demons.
10 She went and reported to those
who had been with Him, as they were
mourning and weeping.
11 Yet, when they heard that He was
alive and had been seen by her, they did
not believe it.
12 Then a er this, He appeared in a
diﬀerent form to two of them walking
on their way into the country.MARK 16
106
13 And they went and reported it to the
rest, who did not believe them either.
14 Later, He appeared to the Eleven
themselves as they were reclining at
the table. He rebuked their unbelief and
hardness of heart, because they did not
believe those who saw Him a er He had
been resurrected.
15 Then He said to them, "Go into all
the world and preach the gospel to the
whole crea on.
16 Whoever believes and is bap zed will
be saved, but whoever does not believe
will be condemned.
17 And these signs will accompany
those who believe: In My name they will
drive out demons; they will speak in new
languages;
18 they will pick up snakes; if they
should drink anything deadly, it will
never harm them; they will lay hands on
the sick, and they will get well."MARK 16
19 Then a
107
er speaking to them, the
Lord Jesus was taken up into heaven and
sat down at the right hand of God.
20 And they went out and preached
everywhere, the Lord working with
them and conﬁrming the word by the
accompanying signs.]Luke

1 Many have undertaken to compile
a narra ve about the events that
have been fulﬁlled among us,
2 just as the original eyewitnesses and
servants of the word handed them down
to us.
3 It also seemed good to me, since I
have carefully inves gated everything
from the very ﬁrst, to write to you
in orderly sequence, most honorable
Theophilus,
4 so that you may know the certainty of
the things about which you have been
instructed.
5 In the days of King Herod of Judea,
there was a priest of Abijah's division
named Zechariah. His wife was from theLUKE 1
2
daughters of Aaron, and her name was
Elizabeth.
6 Both were righteous in God's sight,
living without blame according to all the
commandments and requirements of
the Lord.
7 But they had no children because
Elizabeth could not conceive, and both
of them were well along in years.
8 When his division was on duty and he
was serving as priest before God,
9 it happened that he was chosen by
lot, according to the custom of the
priesthood, to enter the sanctuary of the
Lord and burn incense.
10 At the hour of incense the whole
assembly of the people was praying
outside.
11 An angel of the Lord appeared to
him, standing to the right of the altar of
incense.LUKE 1
3
12 When Zechariah saw him, he was
startled and overcome with fear.
13 But the angel said to him: Do not be
afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer
has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will
bear you a son, and you will name him
John.
14 There will be joy and delight for you,
and many will rejoice at his birth.
15 For he will be great in the sight of
the Lord and will never drink wine or
beer. He will be ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit
while s ll in his mother's womb.
16 He will turn many of the sons of Israel
to the Lord their God.
17 And he will go before Him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the
hearts of fathers to their children, and
the disobedient to the understanding

18 "How can I know this?" Zechariah
asked the angel. "For I am an old man,
and my wife is well along in years."
19 The angel answered him, "I am
Gabriel, who stands in the presence of
God, and I was sent to speak to you and
tell you this good news.
20 Now listen! You will become silent
and unable to speak un l the day these
things take place, because you did not
believe my words, which will be fulﬁlled
in their proper me."
21 Meanwhile, the people were wai ng
for Zechariah, amazed that he stayed so
long in the sanctuary.
22 When he did come out, he could not
speak to them. Then they realized that
he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He
kept making signs to them and remained
speechless.
23 When the days of his ministry were
completed, he went back home.LUKE 1
24 A

er these days his wife Elizabeth
conceived and kept herself in seclusion
for ﬁve months. She said,
25 "The Lord has done this for me. He
has looked with favor in these days
to take away my disgrace among the
people."
26 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel
was sent by God to a town in Galilee
called Nazareth,
27 to a virgin engaged to a man named
Joseph, of the house of David. The
virgin's name was Mary.
28 And the angel came to her and said,
"Rejoice, favored woman! The Lord is
with you."
29 But she was deeply troubled by this
statement, wondering what kind of
gree ng this could be.
30 Then the angel told her: Do not be
afraid, Mary, for you have found favor
with God.LUKE 1
6
31 Now listen: You will conceive and
give birth to a son, and you will call His
name JESUS.
32 He will be great and will be called the
Son of the Most High, and the Lord God
will give Him the throne of His father
David.
33 He will reign over the house of Jacob
forever, and His kingdom will have no
end.
34 Mary asked the angel, "How can this
be, since I have not been in mate with a
man?"
35 The angel replied to her: The Holy
Spirit will come upon you, and the power
of the Most High will overshadow you.
Therefore the holy One to be born will
be called the Son of God.
36 And consider your rela ve Elizabeth-
-even she has conceived a son in her old
age, and this is the sixth month for her
who was called barren.LUKE 1
7
37 For nothing will be impossible with
God."
38 "I am the Lord's slave," said Mary.
"May it be done to me according to your
word." Then the angel le her.
39 In those days Mary set out and
hurried to a town in the hill country of
Judah
40 where she entered Zechariah's house
and greeted Elizabeth.
41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's
gree ng, the baby leaped inside her, and
Elizabeth was ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit.
42 Then she exclaimed with a loud cry:
You are the most blessed of women, and
your child will be blessed!
43 How could this happen to me, that
the mother of my Lord should come to
me?
44 For you see, when the sound of your
gree ng reached my ears, the baby
leaped for joy inside me!LUKE 1
8
45 She who has believed is blessed
because what was spoken to her by the
Lord will be fulﬁlled!"
46 And Mary said: My soul proclaims
the greatness of the Lord,
47 and my spirit has rejoiced in God my
Savior,
48 because He has looked with favor
on the humble condi on of His slave.
Surely, from now on all genera ons will
call me blessed,
49 because the Mighty One has done
great things for me, and His name is holy.
50 His mercy is from genera on to
genera on on those who fear Him.
51 He has done a mighty deed with His
arm; He has sca ered the proud because
of the thoughts of their hearts;
52 He has toppled the mighty from their
thrones and exalted the lowly.
53 He has sa sﬁed the hungry with good
things and sent the rich away empty.LUKE 1
9
54 He has helped His servant Israel,
mindful of His mercy,
55 just as He spoke to our ancestors, to
Abraham and his descendants forever.
56 And Mary stayed with her about
three months; then she returned to her
home.
57 Now the me had come for Elizabeth
to give birth, and she had a son.
58 Then her neighbors and rela ves
heard that the Lord had shown her His
great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.
59 When they came to circumcise the
child on the eighth day, they were going
to name him Zechariah, a er his father.
60 But his mother responded, "No! He
will be called John."
61 Then they said to her, "None of your
rela ves has that name."
62 So they mo oned to his father to ﬁnd
out what he wanted him to be called.LUKE 1
63 He asked for a wri
10
ng tablet and
wrote: HIS NAME IS JOHN And they were
all amazed.
64 Immediately his mouth was opened
and his tongue set free , and he began to
speak, praising God.
65 Fear came on all those who lived
around them, and all these things were
being talked about throughout the hill
country of Judea.
66 All who heard about him took it to
heart, saying, "What then will this child
become?" For, indeed, the Lord's hand
was with him.
67 Then his father Zechariah was ﬁlled
with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
68 Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
because He has visited and provided
redemp on for His people.
69 He has raised up a horn of salva on
for us in the house of His servant David,LUKE 1
11
70 just as He spoke by the mouth of His
holy prophets in ancient mes;
71 salva on from our enemies and from
the clutches of those who hate us.
72 He has dealt mercifully with our
fathers and remembered His holy
covenant--
73 the oath that He swore to our father
Abraham. He has given us the privilege,
74 since we have been rescued from our
enemies' clutches, to serve Him without
fear
75 in holiness and righteousness in His
presence all our days.
76 And child, you will be called a
prophet of the Most High, for you will go
before the Lord to prepare His ways,
77 to give His people knowledge of
salva on through the forgiveness of
their sins.LUKE 1 – 2
12
78 Because of our God's merciful
compassion, the Dawn from on high will
visit us
79 to shine on those who live in
darkness and the shadow of death, to
guide our feet into the way of peace.
80 The child grew up and became
spiritually strong, and he was in the
wilderness un l the day of his public
appearance to Israel.
1 In those days a decree went out
from Caesar Augustus that the whole
empire should be registered.
2 This ﬁrst registra on took place while
Quirinius was governing Syria.
3 So everyone went to be registered,
each to his own town.
4 And Joseph also went up from the
town of Nazareth in Galilee, to Judea,
to the city of David, which is called
Bethlehem, because he was of the house
and family line of David,
2LUKE 2
13
5 to be registered along with Mary, who
was engaged to him and was pregnant.
6 While they were there, the me came
for her to give birth.
7 Then she gave birth to her ﬁrstborn
Son, and she wrapped Him snugly
in cloth and laid Him in a feeding
trough--because there was no room for
them at the inn.
8 In the same region, shepherds were
staying out in the ﬁelds and keeping
watch at night over their ﬂock.
9 Then an angel of the Lord stood before
them, and the glory of the Lord shone
around them, and they were terriﬁed.
10 But the angel said to them, "Don't be
afraid, for look, I proclaim to you good
news of great joy that will be for all the
people:
11 today a Savior, who is Messiah the
Lord, was born for you in the city of
David.LUKE 2
14
12 This will be the sign for you: you will
ﬁnd a baby wrapped snugly in cloth and
lying in a feeding trough."
13 Suddenly there was a mul tude
of the heavenly host with the angel,
praising God and saying:
14 Glory to God in the highest heaven,
and peace on earth to people He favors!
15 When the angels had le them and
returned to heaven, the shepherds said
to one another, "Let's go straight to
Bethlehem and see what has happened,
which the Lord has made known to us."
16 They hurried oﬀ and found both
Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was
lying in the feeding trough.
17 A er seeing them , they reported the
message they were told about this child,
18 and all who heard it were amazed at
what the shepherds said to them.LUKE 2
15
19 But Mary was treasuring up all these
things in her heart and medita ng on
them.
20 The shepherds returned, glorifying
and praising God for all they had seen
and heard, just as they had been told.
21 When the eight days were completed
for His circumcision, He was named
JESUS--the name given by the angel
before He was conceived.
22 And when the days of their
puriﬁca on according to the law of
Moses were ﬁnished, they brought Him
up to Jerusalem to present Him to the
Lord
23 (just as it is wri en in the law of
the Lord: Every ﬁrstborn male will be
dedicated to the Lord )
24 and to oﬀer a sacriﬁce (according to
what is stated in the law of the Lord: a
pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
).LUKE 2
16
25 There was a man in Jerusalem
whose name was Simeon. This man was
righteous and devout, looking forward to
Israel's consola on, and the Holy Spirit
was on him.
26 It had been revealed to him by the
Holy Spirit that he would not see death
before he saw the Lord's Messiah.
27 Guided by the Spirit, he entered
the temple complex. When the parents
brought in the child Jesus to perform for
Him what was customary under the law,
28 Simeon took Him up in his arms,
praised God, and said:
29 Now, Master, You can dismiss Your
slave in peace, according to Your word.
30 For my eyes have seen Your salva on.
31 You have prepared it in the presence
of all peoples--
32 a light for revela on to the Gen les
and glory to Your people Israel.LUKE 2
17
33 His father and mother were amazed
at what was being said about Him.
34 Then Simeon blessed them and told
His mother Mary: "Indeed, this child is
des ned to cause the fall and rise of
many in Israel and to be a sign that will
be opposed--
35 and a sword will pierce your own
soul--that the thoughts of many hearts
may be revealed."
36 There was also a prophetess, Anna,
a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe
of Asher. She was well along in years,
having lived with her husband seven
years a er her marriage,
37 and was a widow for 84 years. She
did not leave the temple complex,
serving God night and day with fas ngs
and prayers.
38 At that very moment, she came up
and began to thank God and to speakLUKE 2
18
about Him to all who were looking
forward to the redemp on of Jerusalem.
39 When they had completed everything
according to the law of the Lord, they
returned to Galilee, to their own town of
Nazareth.
40 The boy grew up and became strong,
ﬁlled with wisdom, and God's grace was
on Him.
41 Every year His parents traveled to
Jerusalem for the Passover Fes val.
42 When He was 12 years old, they
went up according to the custom of the
fes val.
43 A er those days were over, as they
were returning, the boy Jesus stayed
behind in Jerusalem, but His parents did
not know it.
44 Assuming He was in the traveling
party, they went a day's journey. Then
they began looking for Him among their
rela ves and friends.LUKE 2
19
45 When they did not ﬁnd Him, they
returned to Jerusalem to search for Him.
46 A er three days, they found Him in
the temple complex si ng among the
teachers, listening to them and asking
them ques ons.
47 And all those who heard Him were
astounded at His understanding and His
answers.
48 When His parents saw Him, they
were astonished, and His mother said
to Him, "Son, why have You treated us
like this? Your father and I have been
anxiously searching for You."
49 "Why were you searching for Me?"
He asked them. "Didn't you know that I
had to be in my Father's house?"
50 But they did not understand what He
said to them.
51 Then He went down with them and
came to Nazareth and was obedient toLUKE 2 – 3
20
them. His mother kept all these things in
her heart.
52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature, and in favor with God and with
people.
1 In the ﬁ eenth year of the reign
of Tiberius Caesar, while Pon us
Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod
was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother
Philip tetrarch of the region of Iturea
and Trachoni s, and Lysanias tetrarch of
Abilene,
2 during the high priesthood of Annas
and Caiaphas, God's word came to John
the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
3 He went into all the vicinity of
the Jordan, preaching a bap sm of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
4 as it is wri en in the book of the
words of the prophet Isaiah: A voice
of one crying out in the wilderness:
3LUKE 3
21
"Prepare the way for the Lord; make His
paths straight!
5 Every valley will be ﬁlled, and every
mountain and hill will be made low; the
crooked will become straight, the rough
ways smooth,
6 and everyone will see the salva on of
God."
7 He then said to the crowds who came
out to be bap zed by him, "Brood of
vipers! Who warned you to ﬂee from the
coming wrath?
8 Therefore produce fruit consistent
with repentance. And don't start saying
to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our
father,' for I tell you that God is able
to raise up children for Abraham from
these stones!
9 Even now the ax is ready to strike the
root of the trees! Therefore every tree
that doesn't produce good fruit will be
cut down and thrown into the ﬁre."LUKE 3
22
10 "What then should we do?" the
crowds were asking him.
11 He replied to them, "The one who
has two shirts must share with someone
who has none, and the one who has
food must do the same."
12 Tax collectors also came to be
bap zed, and they asked him, "Teacher,
what should we do?"
13 He told them, "Don't collect any more
than what you have been authorized."
14 Some soldiers also ques oned him:
"What should we do?" He said to them,
"Don't take money from anyone by force
or false accusa on; be sa sﬁed with
your wages."
15 Now the people were wai ng
expectantly, and all of them were
deba ng in their minds whether John
might be the Messiah.
16 John answered them all, "I bap ze
you with water, but One is coming whoLUKE 3
23
is more powerful than I. I am not worthy
to un e the strap of His sandals. He will
bap ze you with the Holy Spirit and ﬁre.
17 His winnowing shovel is in His hand
to clear His threshing ﬂoor and gather
the wheat into His barn, but the chaﬀ He
will burn up with a ﬁre that never goes
out."
18 Then, along with many other
exhorta ons, he proclaimed good news
to the people.
19 But Herod the tetrarch, being
rebuked by him about Herodias, his
brother's wife, and about all the evil
things Herod had done,
20 added this to everything else--he
locked John up in prison.
21 When all the people were bap zed,
Jesus also was bap zed. As He was
praying, heaven opened,
22 and the Holy Spirit descended on
Him in a physical appearance like a dove.LUKE 3
24
And a voice came from heaven: You are
My beloved Son. I take delight in You!
23 As He began His ministry , Jesus was
about 30 years old and was thought to
be the son of Joseph, son of Heli,

1 Then Jesus returned from the
Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, and
was led by the Spirit in the wilderness
2 for 40 days to be tempted by the Devil.
He ate nothing during those days, and
when they were over, He was hungry.
4LUKE 4
26
3 The Devil said to Him, "If You are the
Son of God, tell this stone to become
bread."
4 But Jesus answered him, "It is wri en:
Man must not live on bread alone. "
5 So he took Him up and showed Him all
the kingdoms of the world in a moment
of me.
6 The Devil said to Him, "I will give You
their splendor and all this authority,
because it has been given over to me,
and I can give it to anyone I want.
7 If You, then, will worship me, all will
be Yours."
8 And Jesus answered him, "It is wri en:
Worship the Lord your God, and serve
Him only. "
9 So he took Him to Jerusalem, had Him
stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and
said to Him, "If You are the Son of God,
throw Yourself down from here.LUKE 4
10 For it is wri
27
en: He will give His
angels orders concerning you, to protect
you,
11 and they will support you with their
hands, so that you will not strike your
foot against a stone. "
12 And Jesus answered him, "It is said:
Do not test the Lord your God. "
13 A er the Devil had ﬁnished every
tempta on, he departed from Him for a
me.
14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the
power of the Spirit, and news about Him
spread throughout the en re vicinity.
15 He was teaching in their synagogues,
being acclaimed by everyone.
16 He came to Nazareth, where He had
been brought up. As usual, He entered
the synagogue on the Sabbath day and
stood up to read.LUKE 4
28
17 The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was
given to Him, and unrolling the scroll, He
found the place where it was wri en:
18 The Spirit of the Lord is on Me,
because He has anointed Me to preach
good news to the poor. He has sent Me
to proclaim freedom to the cap ves and
recovery of sight to the blind, to set free
the oppressed,
19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's
favor.
20 He then rolled up the scroll, gave it
back to the a endant, and sat down. And
the eyes of everyone in the synagogue
were ﬁxed on Him.
21 He began by saying to them, "Today
as you listen, this Scripture has been
fulﬁlled."
22 They were all speaking well of Him
and were amazed by the gracious words
that came from His mouth, yet they said,
"Isn't this Joseph's son?"LUKE 4
29
23 Then He said to them, "No doubt you
will quote this proverb to Me: 'Doctor,
heal yourself.' 'All we've heard that took
place in Capernaum, do here in Your
hometown also.'"
24 He also said, "I assure you: No
prophet is accepted in his hometown.
25 But I say to you, there were certainly
many widows in Israel in Elijah's days,
when the sky was shut up for three years
and six months while a great famine
came over all the land.
26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of
them--but to a widow at Zarephath in
Sidon.
27 And in the prophet Elisha's me,
there were many in Israel who had
serious skin diseases, yet not one of
them was healed--only Naaman the
Syrian."
28 When they heard this, everyone in
the synagogue was enraged.LUKE 4
30
29 They got up, drove Him out of town,
and brought Him to the edge of the hill
their town was built on, intending to
hurl Him over the cliﬀ.
30 But He passed right through the
crowd and went on His way.
31 Then He went down to Capernaum, a
town in Galilee, and was teaching them
on the Sabbath.
32 They were astonished at His teaching
because His message had authority.
33 In the synagogue there was a man
with an unclean demonic spirit who
cried out with a loud voice,
34 "Leave us alone! What do You have
to do with us, Jesus--Nazarene? Have
You come to destroy us? I know who You
are--the Holy One of God!"
35 But Jesus rebuked him and said,
"Be quiet and come out of him!" And
throwing him down before them, theLUKE 4
31
demon came out of him without hur ng
him at all.
36 They were all struck with amazement
and kept saying to one another, "What
is this message? For He commands the
unclean spirits with authority and power,
and they come out!"
37 And news about Him began to go out
to every place in the vicinity.
38 A er He le the synagogue, He
entered Simon's house. Simon's mother-
in-law was suﬀering from a high fever,
and they asked Him about her.
39 So He stood over her and rebuked
the fever, and it le her. She got up
immediately and began to serve them.
40 When the sun was se ng, all those
who had anyone sick with various
diseases brought them to Him. As He
laid His hands on each one of them, He
would heal them.LUKE 4 – 5
32
41 Also, demons were coming out of
many, shou ng and saying, "You are the
Son of God!" But He rebuked them and
would not allow them to speak, because
they knew He was the Messiah.
42 When it was day, He went out and
made His way to a deserted place. But
the crowds were searching for Him. They
came to Him and tried to keep Him from
leaving them.
43 But He said to them, "I must proclaim
the good news about the kingdom of
God to the other towns also, because I
was sent for this purpose."
44 And He was preaching in the
synagogues of Galilee.
1 As the crowd was pressing in on
Jesus to hear God's word, He was
standing by Lake Gennesaret.
2 He saw two boats at the edge of the
lake; the ﬁshermen had le them and
were washing their nets.
5LUKE 5
33
3 He got into one of the boats, which
belonged to Simon, and asked him to
put out a li le from the land. Then He
sat down and was teaching the crowds
from the boat.
4 When He had ﬁnished speaking, He
said to Simon, "Put out into deep water
and let down your nets for a catch."
5 "Master," Simon replied, "we've
worked hard all night long and caught
nothing! But at Your word, I'll let down
the nets."
6 When they did this, they caught a
great number of ﬁsh, and their nets
began to tear.
7 So they signaled to their partners in
the other boat to come and help them;
they came and ﬁlled both boats so full
that they began to sink.
8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at
Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from
me, because I'm a sinful man, Lord!"LUKE 5
34
9 For he and all those with him were
amazed at the catch of ﬁsh they took,
10 and so were James and John,
Zebedee's sons, who were Simon's
partners. "Don't be afraid," Jesus told
Simon. "From now on you will be
catching people!"
11 Then they brought the boats to land,
le everything, and followed Him.
12 While He was in one of the towns, a
man was there who had a serious skin
disease all over him. He saw Jesus, fell
facedown, and begged Him: "Lord, if You
are willing, You can make me clean."
13 Reaching out His hand, He touched
him, saying, "I am willing; be made
clean," and immediately the disease le
him.
14 Then He ordered him to tell no one:
"But go and show yourself to the priest,
and oﬀer what Moses prescribed for
your cleansing as a tes mony to them."LUKE 5
35
15 But the news about Him spread even
more, and large crowds would come
together to hear Him and to be healed
of their sicknesses.
16 Yet He o en withdrew to deserted
places and prayed.
17 On one of those days while He was
teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the
law were si ng there who had come
from every village of Galilee and Judea,
and also from Jerusalem. And the Lord's
power to heal was in Him.
18 Just then some men came, carrying
on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed.
They tried to bring him in and set him
down before Him.
19 Since they could not ﬁnd a way to
bring him in because of the crowd, they
went up on the roof and lowered him on
the stretcher through the roof les into
the middle of the crowd before Jesus.LUKE 5
36
20 Seeing their faith He said, "Friend,
your sins are forgiven you."
21 Then the scribes and the Pharisees
began to reason: "Who is this man who
speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive
sins but God alone?"
22 But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus
replied to them, "Why are you reasoning
this in your hearts?
23 Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins
are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Get up and
walk'?
24 But so you may know that the Son
of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins"--He told the paralyzed man, "I tell
you: get up, pick up your stretcher, and
go home."
25 Immediately he got up before them,
picked up what he had been lying on,
and went home glorifying God.
26 Then everyone was astounded, and
they were giving glory to God. And theyLUKE 5
37
were ﬁlled with awe and said, "We have
seen incredible things today!"
27 A er this, Jesus went out and saw a
tax collector named Levi si ng at the tax
oﬃce, and He said to him, "Follow Me!"
28 So, leaving everything behind, he got
up and began to follow Him.
29 Then Levi hosted a grand banquet for
Him at his house. Now there was a large
crowd of tax collectors and others who
were guests with them.
30 But the Pharisees and their scribes
were complaining to His disciples, "Why
do you eat and drink with tax collectors
and sinners?"
31 Jesus replied to them, "The healthy
don't need a doctor, but the sick do.
32 I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance."
33 Then they said to Him, "John's
disciples fast o en and say prayers, andLUKE 5
38
those of the Pharisees do the same, but
Yours eat and drink."
34 Jesus said to them, "You can't make
the wedding guests fast while the groom
is with them, can you?
35 But the days will come when
the groom will be taken away from
them--then they will fast in those days."
36 He also told them a parable: "No one
tears a patch from a new garment and
puts it on an old garment. Otherwise,
not only will he tear the new, but also
the piece from the new garment will not
match the old.
37 And no one puts new wine into old
wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will
burst the skins, it will spill, and the skins
will be ruined.
38 But new wine should be put into
fresh wineskins.LUKE 5 – 6
39 And no one, a
39
er drinking old wine,
wants new, because he says, 'The old is
be er.'"
1 On a Sabbath, He passed through
the grainﬁelds. His disciples were
picking heads of grain, rubbing them in
their hands, and ea ng them.
2 But some of the Pharisees said, "Why
are you doing what is not lawful on the
Sabbath?"
3 Jesus answered them, "Haven't you
read what David and those who were
with him did when he was hungry--
4 how he entered the house of God, and
took and ate the sacred bread, which is
not lawful for any but the priests to eat?
He even gave some to those who were
with him."
5 Then He told them, "The Son of Man
is Lord of the Sabbath."
6LUKE 6
40
6 On another Sabbath He entered the
synagogue and was teaching. A man was
there whose right hand was paralyzed.
7 The scribes and Pharisees were
watching Him closely, to see if He would
heal on the Sabbath, so that they could
ﬁnd a charge against Him.
8 But He knew their thoughts and told
the man with the paralyzed hand, "Get
up and stand here." So he got up and
stood there.
9 Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you: is
it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to
do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"
10 A er looking around at them all, He
told him, "Stretch out your hand." He
did so, and his hand was restored.
11 They, however, were ﬁlled with rage
and started discussing with one another
what they might do to Jesus.LUKE 6
41
12 During those days He went out to the
mountain to pray and spent all night in
prayer to God.
13 When daylight came, He summoned
His disciples, and He chose 12 of
them--He also named them apostles:
14 Simon, whom He also named Peter,
and Andrew his brother; James and
John; Philip and Bartholomew;
15 Ma hew and Thomas; James the
son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the
Zealot;
16 Judas the son of James, and Judas
Iscariot, who became a traitor.
17 A er coming down with them, He
stood on a level place with a large crowd
of His disciples and a great mul tude of
people from all Judea and Jerusalem and
from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.
18 They came to hear Him and to be
healed of their diseases; and thoseLUKE 6
42
tormented by unclean spirits were made
well.
19 The whole crowd was trying to touch
Him, because power was coming out
from Him and healing them all.
20 Then looking up at His disciples, He
said: Blessed are you who are poor,
because the kingdom of God is yours.
21 Blessed are you who are hungry now,
because you will be ﬁlled. Blessed are
you who weep now, because you will
laugh.
22 Blessed are you when people hate
you, when they exclude you, insult you,
and slander your name as evil, because
of the Son of Man.
23 "Rejoice in that day and leap for
joy! Take note--your reward is great in
heaven, because this is the way their
ancestors used to treat the prophets.
24 But woe to you who are rich, because
you have received your comfort.LUKE 6
43
25 Woe to you who are full now, because
you will be hungry. Woe to you who are
laughing now, because you will mourn
and weep.
26 Woe to you when all people speak
well of you, because this is the way
their ancestors used to treat the false
prophets.
27 "But I say to you who listen: Love
your enemies, do good to those who
hate you,
28 bless those who curse you, pray for
those who mistreat you.
29 If anyone hits you on the cheek, oﬀer
the other also. And if anyone takes away
your coat, don't hold back your shirt
either.
30 Give to everyone who asks from
you, and from one who takes away your
things, don't ask for them back.
31 Just as you want others to do for you,
do the same for them.LUKE 6
44
32 If you love those who love you, what
credit is that to you? Even sinners love
those who love them.
33 If you do what is good to those who
are good to you, what credit is that to
you? Even sinners do that.
34 And if you lend to those from whom
you expect to receive, what credit is that
to you? Even sinners lend to sinners to
be repaid in full.
35 But love your enemies, do what is
good, and lend, expec ng nothing in
return. Then your reward will be great,
and you will be sons of the Most High.
For He is gracious to the ungrateful and
evil.
36 Be merciful, just as your Father also
is merciful.
37 "Do not judge, and you will not be
judged. Do not condemn, and you will
not be condemned. Forgive, and you will
be forgiven.LUKE 6
45
38 Give, and it will be given to you; a
good measure--pressed down, shaken
together, and running over--will be
poured into your lap. For with the
measure you use, it will be measured
back to you."
39 He also told them a parable: "Can the
blind guide the blind? Won't they both
fall into a pit?
40 A disciple is not above his teacher,
but everyone who is fully trained will be
like his teacher.
41 "Why do you look at the speck in
your brother's eye, but don't no ce the
log in your own eye?
42 Or how can you say to your brother,
'Brother, let me take out the speck that
is in your eye,' when you yourself don't
see the log in your eye? Hypocrite! First
take the log out of your eye, and then
you will see clearly to take out the speck
in your brother's eye.LUKE 6
46
43 "A good tree doesn't produce bad
fruit; on the other hand, a bad tree
doesn't produce good fruit.
44 For each tree is known by its
own fruit. Figs aren't gathered from
thornbushes, or grapes picked from a
bramble bush.
45 A good man produces good out of
the good storeroom of his heart. An
evil man produces evil out of the evil
storeroom, for his mouth speaks from
the overﬂow of the heart.
46 "Why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and
don't do the things I say?
47 I will show you what someone is like
who comes to Me, hears My words, and
acts on them:
48 He is like a man building a house,
who dug deep and laid the founda on
on the rock. When the ﬂood came, the
river crashed against that house andLUKE 6 – 7
47
couldn't shake it, because it was well
built.
49 But the one who hears and does not
act is like a man who built a house on
the ground without a founda on. The
river crashed against it, and immediately
it collapsed. And the destruc on of that
house was great!"
1 When He had concluded all His
sayings in the hearing of the people,
He entered Capernaum.
2 A centurion's slave, who was highly
valued by him, was sick and about to die.
3 When the centurion heard about
Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to
Him, reques ng Him to come and save
the life of his slave.
4 When they reached Jesus, they
pleaded with Him earnestly, saying, "He
is worthy for You to grant this,
5 because he loves our na on and has
built us a synagogue."
7LUKE 7
48
6 Jesus went with them, and when
He was not far from the house, the
centurion sent friends to tell Him, "Lord,
don't trouble Yourself, since I am not
worthy to have You come under my roof.
7 That is why I didn't even consider
myself worthy to come to You. But say
the word, and my servant will be cured.
8 For I too am a man placed under
authority, having soldiers under my
command. I say to this one, 'Go!' and
he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he
comes; and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he
does it."
9 Jesus heard this and was amazed at
him, and turning to the crowd following
Him, He said, "I tell you, I have not found
so great a faith even in Israel!"
10 When those who had been sent
returned to the house, they found the
slave in good health.LUKE 7
11 Soon a
49
erwards He was on His way
to a town called Nain. His disciples and a
large crowd were traveling with Him.
12 Just as He neared the gate of the
town, a dead man was being carried out.
He was his mother's only son, and she
was a widow. A large crowd from the city
was also with her.
13 When the Lord saw her, He had
compassion on her and said, "Don't cry."
14 Then He came up and touched
the open coﬃn, and the pallbearers
stopped. And He said, "Young man, I tell
you, get up!"
15 The dead man sat up and began to
speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.
16 Then fear came over everyone, and
they gloriﬁed God, saying, "A great
prophet has risen among us," and "God
has visited His people."
17 This report about Him went
throughout Judea and all the vicinity.LUKE 7
50
18 Then John's disciples told him about
all these things. So John summoned two
of his disciples
19 and sent them to the Lord, asking,
"Are You the One who is to come, or
should we look for someone else?"
20 When the men reached Him, they
said, "John the Bap st sent us to ask
You, 'Are You the One who is to come, or
should we look for someone else?'"
21 At that me Jesus healed many
people of diseases, plagues, and evil
spirits, and He granted sight to many
blind people.
22 He replied to them, "Go and report
to John the things you have seen and
heard: The blind receive their sight, the
lame walk, those with skin diseases
are healed, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised, and the poor have the good news
preached to them.LUKE 7
51
23 And anyone who is not oﬀended
because of Me is blessed."
24 A er John's messengers le , He
began to speak to the crowds about
John: "What did you go out into the
wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
wind?
25 What then did you go out to see? A
man dressed in so robes? Look, those
who are splendidly dressed and live in
luxury are in royal palaces.
26 What then did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more
than a prophet.
27 This is the one it is wri en about:
Look, I am sending My messenger ahead
of You; he will prepare Your way before
You.
28 I tell you, among those born of
women no one is greater than John,
but the least in the kingdom of God is
greater than he."LUKE 7
52
29 (And when all the people,
including the tax collectors, heard
this, they acknowledged God's way of
righteousness, because they had been
bap zed with John's bap sm.
30 But since the Pharisees and experts
in the law had not been bap zed by
him, they rejected the plan of God for
themselves.)
31 "To what then should I compare the
people of this genera on, and what are
they like?
32 They are like children si ng in the
marketplace and calling to each other:
We played the ﬂute for you, but you
didn't dance; we sang a lament, but you
didn't weep!
33 For John the Bap st did not come
ea ng bread or drinking wine, and you
say, 'He has a demon!'
34 The Son of Man has come ea ng and
drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glu onLUKE 7
53
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and sinners!'
35 Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her
children."
36 Then one of the Pharisees invited
Him to eat with him. He entered the
Pharisee's house and reclined at the
table.
37 And a woman in the town who was a
sinner found out that Jesus was reclining
at the table in the Pharisee's house. She
brought an alabaster ﬂask of fragrant oil
38 and stood behind Him at His feet,
weeping, and began to wash His feet
with her tears. She wiped His feet with
the hair of her head, kissing them and
anoin ng them with the fragrant oil.
39 When the Pharisee who had invited
Him saw this, he said to himself, "This
man, if He were a prophet, would know
who and what kind of woman this is who
is touching Him--she's a sinner!"LUKE 7
54
40 Jesus replied to him, "Simon, I have
something to say to you." "Teacher," he
said, "say it."
41 "A creditor had two debtors. One
owed 500 denarii, and the other 50.
42 Since they could not pay it back, he
graciously forgave them both. So, which
of them will love him more?"
43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one
he forgave more." "You have judged
correctly," He told him.
44 Turning to the woman, He said to
Simon, "Do you see this woman? I
entered your house; you gave Me no
water for My feet, but she, with her
tears, has washed My feet and wiped
them with her hair.
45 You gave Me no kiss, but she hasn't
stopped kissing My feet since I came in.
46 You didn't anoint My head with
oil, but she has anointed My feet with
fragrant oil.LUKE 7 – 8
55
47 Therefore I tell you, her many sins
have been forgiven; that's why she loved
much. But the one who is forgiven li le,
loves li le."
48 Then He said to her, "Your sins are
forgiven."
49 Those who were at the table with
Him began to say among themselves,
"Who is this man who even forgives
sins?"
50 And He said to the woman, "Your
faith has saved you. Go in peace."
1 Soon a erwards He was traveling
from one town and village to
another, preaching and telling the good
news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve
were with Him,
2 and also some women who had been
healed of evil spirits and sicknesses:
Mary, called Magdalene (seven demons
had come out of her);
8LUKE 8
56
3 Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's
steward; Susanna; and many others
who were suppor ng them from their
possessions.
4 As a large crowd was gathering, and
people were ﬂocking to Him from every
town, He said in a parable:
5 "A sower went out to sow his seed. As
he was sowing, some fell along the path;
it was trampled on, and the birds of the
sky ate it up.
6 Other seed fell on the rock; when it
sprang up, it withered, since it lacked
moisture.
7 Other seed fell among thorns; the
thorns sprang up with it and choked it.
8 S ll other seed fell on good ground;
when it sprang up, it produced a crop:
100 mes what was sown ." As He said
this, He called out, "Anyone who has
ears to hear should listen!"LUKE 8
57
9 Then His disciples asked Him, "What
does this parable mean?"
10 So He said, "The secrets of the
kingdom of God have been given for you
to know, but to the rest it is in parables,
so that Looking they may not see, and
hearing they may not understand.
11 "This is the meaning of the parable:
The seed is the word of God.
12 The seeds along the path are those
who have heard. Then the Devil comes
and takes away the word from their
hearts, so that they may not believe and
be saved.
13 And the seeds on the rock are those
who, when they hear, welcome the
word with joy. Having no root, these
believe for a while and depart in a me
of tes ng.
14 As for the seed that fell among
thorns, these are the ones who, when
they have heard, go on their way andLUKE 8
58
are choked with worries, riches, and
pleasures of life, and produce no mature
fruit.
15 But the seed in the good ground--
these are the ones who, having heard
the word with an honest and good heart,
hold on to it and by enduring, bear fruit.
16 "No one, a er ligh ng a lamp, covers
it with a basket or puts it under a bed,
but puts it on a lampstand so that those
who come in may see the light.
17 For nothing is concealed that won't
be revealed, and nothing hidden that
won't be made known and come to light.
18 Therefore, take care how you listen.
For whoever has, more will be given to
him; and whoever does not have, even
what he thinks he has will be taken away
from him."
19 Then His mother and brothers came
to Him, but they could not meet with
Him because of the crowd.LUKE 8
59
20 He was told, "Your mother and Your
brothers are standing outside, wan ng
to see You."
21 But He replied to them, "My mother
and My brothers are those who hear and
do the word of God."
22 One day He and His disciples got into
a boat, and He told them, "Let's cross
over to the other side of the lake." So
they set out,
23 and as they were sailing He fell
asleep. Then a ﬁerce windstorm came
down on the lake; they were being
swamped and were in danger.
24 They came and woke Him up, saying,
"Master, Master, we're going to die!"
Then He got up and rebuked the wind
and the raging waves. So they ceased,
and there was a calm.
25 He said to them, "Where is your
faith?" They were fearful and amazed,
asking one another, "Who can this be?LUKE 8
60
He commands even the winds and the
waves, and they obey Him!"
26 Then they sailed to the region of the
Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
27 When He got out on land, a demon-
possessed man from the town met Him.
For a long me he had worn no clothes
and did not stay in a house but in the
tombs.
28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out,
fell down before Him, and said in a loud
voice, "What do You have to do with me,
Jesus, You Son of the Most High God? I
beg You, don't torment me!"
29 For He had commanded the unclean
spirit to come out of the man. Many
mes it had seized him, and although
he was guarded, bound by chains and
shackles, he would snap the restraints
and be driven by the demon into
deserted places.LUKE 8
61
30 "What is your name?" Jesus asked
him. "Legion," he said--because many
demons had entered him.
31 And they begged Him not to banish
them to the abyss.
32 A large herd of pigs was there,
feeding on the hillside. The demons
begged Him to permit them to enter the
pigs, and He gave them permission.
33 The demons came out of the man
and entered the pigs, and the herd
rushed down the steep bank into the
lake and drowned.
34 When the men who tended them
saw what had happened, they ran oﬀ
and reported it in the town and in the
countryside.
35 Then people went out to see what
had happened. They came to Jesus
and found the man the demons had
departed from, si ng at Jesus' feet,LUKE 8
62
dressed and in his right mind. And they
were afraid.
36 Meanwhile the eyewitnesses
reported to them how the demon-
possessed man was delivered.
37 Then all the people of the Gerasene
region asked Him to leave them, because
they were gripped by great fear. So
ge ng into the boat, He returned.
38 The man from whom the demons
had departed kept begging Him to be
with Him. But He sent him away and
said,
39 "Go back to your home, and tell all
that God has done for you." And oﬀ he
went, proclaiming throughout the town
all that Jesus had done for him.
40 When Jesus returned, the crowd
welcomed Him, for they were all
expec ng Him.
41 Just then, a man named Jairus came.
He was a leader of the synagogue. HeLUKE 8
63
fell down at Jesus' feet and pleaded with
Him to come to his house,
42 because he had an only daughter
about 12 years old, and she was at
death's door. While He was going, the
crowds were nearly crushing Him.
43 A woman suﬀering from bleeding for
12 years, who had spent all she had on
doctors yet could not be healed by any,
44 approached from behind and
touched the tassel of His robe. Instantly
her bleeding stopped.
45 "Who touched Me?" Jesus asked.
When they all denied it, Peter said,
"Master, the crowds are hemming You in
and pressing against You."
46 "Somebody did touch Me," said
Jesus. "I know that power has gone out
from Me."
47 When the woman saw that she was
discovered, she came trembling and fell
down before Him. In the presence ofLUKE 8
64
all the people, she declared the reason
she had touched Him and how she was
instantly cured.
48 "Daughter," He said to her, "your
faith has made you well. Go in peace."
49 While He was s ll speaking, someone
came from the synagogue leader's house
, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Don't
bother the Teacher anymore."
50 When Jesus heard it, He answered
him, "Don't be afraid. Only believe, and
she will be made well."
51 A er He came to the house, He let
no one enter with Him except Peter,
John, James, and the child's father and
mother.
52 Everyone was crying and mourning
for her. But He said, "Stop crying, for she
is not dead but asleep."
53 They started laughing at Him,
because they knew she was dead.LUKE 8 – 9
65
54 So He took her by the hand and
called out, "Child, get up!"
55 Her spirit returned, and she got up at
once. Then He gave orders that she be
given something to eat.
56 Her parents were astounded, but He
instructed them to tell no one what had
happened.
1 Summoning the Twelve, He gave
them power and authority over all
the demons, and power to heal diseases.
2 Then He sent them to proclaim the
kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
3 "Take nothing for the road," He told
them, "no walking s ck, no traveling
bag, no bread, no money; and don't take
an extra shirt.
4 Whatever house you enter, stay there
and leave from there.
5 If they do not welcome you, when you
leave that town, shake oﬀ the dust from
your feet as a tes mony against them."
9LUKE 9
66
6 So they went out and traveled from
village to village, proclaiming the good
news and healing everywhere.
7 Herod the tetrarch heard about
everything that was going on. He was
perplexed, because some said that John
had been raised from the dead,
8 some that Elijah had appeared, and
others that one of the ancient prophets
had risen.
9 "I beheaded John," Herod said, "but
who is this I hear such things about?"
And he wanted to see Him.
10 When the apostles returned, they
reported to Jesus all that they had
done. He took them along and withdrew
privately to a town called Bethsaida.
11 When the crowds found out, they
followed Him. He welcomed them, spoke
to them about the kingdom of God, and
cured those who needed healing.LUKE 9
67
12 Late in the day, the Twelve
approached and said to Him, "Send the
crowd away, so they can go into the
surrounding villages and countryside to
ﬁnd food and lodging, because we are in
a deserted place here."
13 "You give them something to eat," He
told them. "We have no more than ﬁve
loaves and two ﬁsh," they said, "unless
we go and buy food for all these people."
14 (For about 5,000 men were there.)
Then He told His disciples, "Have them
sit down in groups of about 50 each."
15 They did so, and had them all sit
down.
16 Then He took the ﬁve loaves and the
two ﬁsh, and looking up to heaven, He
blessed and broke them. He kept giving
them to the disciples to set before the
crowd.LUKE 9
68
17 Everyone ate and was ﬁlled. Then
they picked up 12 baskets of le over
pieces.
18 While He was praying in private and
His disciples were with Him, He asked
them, "Who do the crowds say that I
am?"
19 They answered, "John the Bap st;
others, Elijah; s ll others, that one of the
ancient prophets has come back."
20 "But you," He asked them, "who do
you say that I am?" Peter answered,
"God's Messiah!"
21 But He strictly warned and instructed
them to tell this to no one,
22 saying, "The Son of Man must suﬀer
many things and be rejected by the
elders, chief priests, and scribes, be
killed, and be raised the third day."
23 Then He said to them all, "If anyone
wants to come with Me, he must denyLUKE 9
69
himself, take up his cross daily, and
follow Me.
24 For whoever wants to save his life
will lose it, but whoever loses his life
because of Me will save it.
25 What is a man beneﬁted if he gains
the whole world, yet loses or forfeits
himself?
26 For whoever is ashamed of Me
and My words, the Son of Man will be
ashamed of him when He comes in His
glory and that of the Father and the holy
angels.
27 I tell you the truth: there are some
standing here who will not taste death
un l they see the kingdom of God."
28 About eight days a er these words,
He took along Peter, John, and James,
and went up on the mountain to pray.
29 As He was praying, the appearance
of His face changed, and His clothes
became dazzling white.LUKE 9
70
30 Suddenly, two men were talking with
Him--Moses and Elijah.
31 They appeared in glory and were
speaking of His death, which He was
about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
32 Peter and those with him were in a
deep sleep, and when they became fully
awake, they saw His glory and the two
men who were standing with Him.
33 As the two men were depar ng from
Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it's
good for us to be here! Let us make
three tabernacles: one for You, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah"--not knowing
what he said.
34 While he was saying this, a cloud
appeared and overshadowed them.
They became afraid as they entered the
cloud.
35 Then a voice came from the cloud,
saying: This is My Son, the Chosen One;
listen to Him!LUKE 9
36 A
71
er the voice had spoken, only
Jesus was found. They kept silent, and in
those days told no one what they had
seen.
37 The next day, when they came down
from the mountain, a large crowd met
Him.
38 Just then a man from the crowd cried
out, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my
son, because he's my only child .
39 O en a spirit seizes him; suddenly
he shrieks, and it throws him into
convulsions un l he foams at the mouth;
wounding him, it hardly ever leaves him.
40 I begged Your disciples to drive it out,
but they couldn't."
41 Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and
rebellious genera on! How long will I
be with you and put up with you? Bring
your son here."
42 As the boy was s ll approaching, the
demon knocked him down and threwLUKE 9
72
him into severe convulsions. But Jesus
rebuked the unclean spirit, cured the
boy, and gave him back to his father.
43 And they were all astonished at the
greatness of God. While everyone was
amazed at all the things He was doing,
He told His disciples,
44 "Let these words sink in: the Son of
Man is about to be betrayed into the
hands of men."
45 But they did not understand this
statement; it was concealed from them
so that they could not grasp it, and they
were afraid to ask Him about it.
46 Then an argument started among
them about who would be the greatest
of them.
47 But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of
their hearts, took a li le child and had
him stand next to Him.
48 He told them, "Whoever welcomes
this li le child in My name welcomes Me.LUKE 9
73
And whoever welcomes Me welcomes
Him who sent Me. For whoever is least
among you--this one is great."
49 John responded, "Master, we saw
someone driving out demons in Your
name, and we tried to stop him because
he does not follow us."
50 "Don't stop him," Jesus told him,
"because whoever is not against you is
for you."
51 When the days were coming to
a close for Him to be taken up, He
determined to journey to Jerusalem.
52 He sent messengers ahead of Him,
and on the way they entered a village of
the Samaritans to make prepara ons for
Him.
53 But they did not welcome Him,
because He determined to journey to
Jerusalem.
54 When the disciples James and John
saw this, they said, "Lord, do You wantLUKE 9
74
us to call down ﬁre from heaven to
consume them?"
55 But He turned and rebuked them,
56 and they went to another village.
57 As they were traveling on the road
someone said to Him, "I will follow You
wherever You go!"
58 Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens, and
birds of the sky have nests, but the Son
of Man has no place to lay His head."
59 Then He said to another, "Follow
Me." "Lord," he said, "ﬁrst let me go
bury my father."
60 But He told him, "Let the dead bury
their own dead, but you go and spread
the news of the kingdom of God."
61 Another also said, "I will follow
You, Lord, but ﬁrst let me go and say
good-bye to those at my house."
62 But Jesus said to him, "No one who
puts his hand to the plow and looks back
is ﬁt for the kingdom of God."LUKE 10
1A
75
er this, the Lord appointed 70
others, and He sent them ahead
of Him in pairs to every town and place
where He Himself was about to go.
2 He told them: "The harvest is
abundant, but the workers are few.
Therefore, pray to the Lord of the
harvest to send out workers into His
harvest.
3 Now go; I'm sending you out like
lambs among wolves.
4 Don't carry a money-bag, traveling
bag, or sandals; don't greet anyone
along the road.
5 Whatever house you enter, ﬁrst say,
'Peace to this household.'
6 If a son of peace is there, your peace
will rest on him; but if not, it will return
to you.
7 Remain in the same house, ea ng and
drinking what they oﬀer, for the worker
10LUKE 10
76
is worthy of his wages. Don't be moving
from house to house.
8 When you enter any town, and they
welcome you, eat the things set before
you.
9 Heal the sick who are there, and tell
them, 'The kingdom of God has come
near you.'
10 When you enter any town, and
they don't welcome you, go out into its
streets and say,
11 'We are wiping oﬀ as a witness
against you even the dust of your town
that clings to our feet. Know this for
certain: the kingdom of God has come
near.'
12 I tell you, on that day it will be more
tolerable for Sodom than for that town.
13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were
done in you had been done in Tyre andLUKE 10
77
Sidon, they would have repented long
ago, si ng in sackcloth and ashes!
14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
15 And you, Capernaum, will you be
exalted to heaven? No, you will go down
to Hades!
16 Whoever listens to you listens to Me.
Whoever rejects you rejects Me. And
whoever rejects Me rejects the One who
sent Me."
17 The Seventy returned with joy,
saying, "Lord, even the demons submit
to us in Your name."
18 He said to them, "I watched Satan fall
from heaven like a lightning ﬂash.
19 Look, I have given you the authority
to trample on snakes and scorpions and
over all the power of the enemy; nothing
will ever harm you.LUKE 10
78
20 However, don't rejoice that the
spirits submit to you, but rejoice that
your names are wri en in heaven."
21 In that same hour He rejoiced in the
Holy Spirit and said, "I praise You, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because You
have hidden these things from the wise
and the learned and have revealed them
to infants. Yes, Father, because this was
Your good pleasure.
22 All things have been entrusted to Me
by My Father. No one knows who the
Son is except the Father, and who the
Father is except the Son, and anyone to
whom the Son desires to reveal Him."
23 Then turning to His disciples He said
privately, "The eyes that see the things
you see are blessed!
24 For I tell you that many prophets and
kings wanted to see the things you see
yet didn't see them; to hear the things
you hear yet didn't hear them."LUKE 10
79
25 Just then an expert in the law stood
up to test Him, saying, "Teacher, what
must I do to inherit eternal life?"
26 "What is wri en in the law?" He
asked him. "How do you read it?"
27 He answered: Love the Lord your God
with all your heart, with all your soul,
with all your strength, and with all your
mind; and your neighbor as yourself.
28 "You've answered correctly," He told
him. "Do this and you will live."
29 But wan ng to jus fy himself, he
asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
30 Jesus took up the ques on and said:
"A man was going down from Jerusalem
to Jericho and fell into the hands of
robbers. They stripped him, beat him up,
and ﬂed, leaving him half dead.
31 A priest happened to be going down
that road. When he saw him, he passed
by on the other side.LUKE 10
80
32 In the same way, a Levite, when he
arrived at the place and saw him, passed
by on the other side.
33 But a Samaritan on his journey came
up to him, and when he saw the man ,
he had compassion.
34 He went over to him and bandaged
his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
Then he put him on his own animal,
brought him to an inn, and took care of
him.
35 The next day he took out two denarii,
gave them to the innkeeper, and said,
'Take care of him. When I come back I'll
reimburse you for whatever extra you
spend.'
36 "Which of these three do you think
proved to be a neighbor to the man who
fell into the hands of the robbers?"
37 "The one who showed mercy to
him," he said. Then Jesus told him, "Go
and do the same."LUKE 10 – 11
81
38 While they were traveling, He
entered a village, and a woman named
Martha welcomed Him into her home.
39 She had a sister named Mary, who
also sat at the Lord's feet and was
listening to what He said.
40 But Martha was distracted by her
many tasks, and she came up and asked,
"Lord, don't You care that my sister has
le me to serve alone? So tell her to give
me a hand."
41 The Lord answered her, "Martha,
Martha, you are worried and upset
about many things,
42 but one thing is necessary. Mary has
made the right choice, and it will not be
taken away from her."
1 He was praying in a certain
place, and when He ﬁnished, one
of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach
us to pray, just as John also taught his
disciples."
11LUKE 11
82
2 He said to them, "Whenever you pray,
say: Father, Your name be honored as
holy. Your kingdom come.
3 Give us each day our daily bread.
4 And forgive us our sins, for we
ourselves also forgive everyone in
debt to us. And do not bring us into
tempta on."
5 He also said to them: "Suppose one
of you has a friend and goes to him at
midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend
me three loaves of bread,
6 because a friend of mine on a journey
has come to me, and I don't have
anything to oﬀer him.'
7 Then he will answer from inside
and say, 'Don't bother me! The door is
already locked, and my children and I
have gone to bed. I can't get up to give
you anything.'
8 I tell you, even though he won't get up
and give him anything because he is hisLUKE 11
83
friend, yet because of his persistence, he
will get up and give him as much as he
needs.
9 "So I say to you, keep asking, and it
will be given to you. Keep searching, and
you will ﬁnd. Keep knocking, and the
door will be opened to you.
10 For everyone who asks receives,
and the one who searches ﬁnds, and to
the one who knocks, the door will be
opened.
11 What father among you, if his son
asks for a ﬁsh, will give him a snake
instead of a ﬁsh?
12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him
a scorpion?
13 If you then, who are evil, know how
to give good gi s to your children, how
much more will the heavenly Father give
the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?"
14 Now He was driving out a demon that
was mute. When the demon came out,LUKE 11
84
the man who had been mute, spoke, and
the crowds were amazed.
15 But some of them said, "He drives
out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of
the demons!"
16 And others, as a test, were
demanding of Him a sign from heaven.
17 Knowing their thoughts, He told
them: "Every kingdom divided against
itself is headed for destruc on, and a
house divided against itself falls.
18 If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand? For
you say I drive out demons by Beelzebul.
19 And if I drive out demons by
Beelzebul, who is it your sons drive them
out by? For this reason they will be your
judges.
20 If I drive out demons by the ﬁnger of
God, then the kingdom of God has come
to you.LUKE 11
85
21 When a strong man, fully armed,
guards his estate, his possessions are
secure.
22 But when one stronger than he
a acks and overpowers him, he takes
from him all his weapons he trusted in,
and divides up his plunder.
23 Anyone who is not with Me is against
Me, and anyone who does not gather
with Me sca ers.
24 "When an unclean spirit comes out
of a man, it roams through waterless
places looking for rest, and not ﬁnding
rest, it then says, 'I'll go back to my
house where I came from.'
25 And returning, it ﬁnds the house
swept and put in order.
26 Then it goes and brings seven other
spirits more evil than itself, and they
enter and se le down there. As a result,
that man's last condi on is worse than
the ﬁrst."LUKE 11
86
27 As He was saying these things, a
woman from the crowd raised her voice
and said to Him, "The womb that bore
You and the one who nursed You are
blessed!"
28 He said, "Even more, those who
hear the word of God and keep it are
blessed!"
29 As the crowds were increasing, He
began saying: "This genera on is an evil
genera on. It demands a sign, but no
sign will be given to it except the sign of
Jonah.
30 For just as Jonah became a sign to
the people of Nineveh, so also the Son
of Man will be to this genera on.
31 The queen of the south will rise up
at the judgment with the men of this
genera on and condemn them, because
she came from the ends of the earth
to hear the wisdom of Solomon, andLUKE 11
87
look--something greater than Solomon
is here!
32 The men of Nineveh will rise up at
the judgment with this genera on and
condemn it, because they repented
at Jonah's proclama on, and look-
-something greater than Jonah is
here!
33 "No one lights a lamp and puts it in
the cellar or under a basket, but on a
lampstand, so that those who come in
may see its light.
34 Your eye is the lamp of the body.
When your eye is good, your whole body
is also full of light. But when it is bad,
your body is also full of darkness.
35 Take care then, that the light in you is
not darkness.
36 If therefore your whole body is full of
light, with no part of it in darkness, the
whole body will be full of light, as when
a lamp shines its light on you."LUKE 11
88
37 As He was speaking, a Pharisee asked
Him to dine with him. So He went in and
reclined at the table.
38 When the Pharisee saw this, he was
amazed that He did not ﬁrst perform the
ritual washing before dinner.
39 But the Lord said to him: "Now you
Pharisees clean the outside of the cup
and dish, but inside you are full of greed
and evil.
40 Fools! Didn't He who made the
outside make the inside too?
41 But give to charity what is within,
and then everything is clean for you.
42 "But woe to you Pharisees! You give
a tenth of mint, rue, and every kind of
herb, and you bypass jus ce and love for
God. These things you should have done
without neglec ng the others.
43 "Woe to you Pharisees! You love
the front seat in the synagogues and
gree ngs in the marketplaces.LUKE 11
89
44 "Woe to you! You are like unmarked
graves; the people who walk over them
don't know it."
45 One of the experts in the law
answered Him, "Teacher, when You say
these things You insult us too."
46 Then He said: "Woe also to you
experts in the law! You load people with
burdens that are hard to carry, yet you
yourselves don't touch these burdens
with one of your ﬁngers.
47 "Woe to you! You build monuments
to the prophets, and your fathers killed
them.
48 Therefore you are witnesses that you
approve the deeds of your fathers, for
they killed them, and you build their
monuments.
49 Because of this, the wisdom of God
said, 'I will send them prophets and
apostles, and some of them they will kill
and persecute,'LUKE 11 – 12
50 so that this genera
90
on may be held
responsible for the blood of all the
prophets shed since the founda on of
the world--
51 from the blood of Abel to the blood
of Zechariah, who perished between the
altar and the sanctuary. "Yes, I tell you,
this genera on will be held responsible.
52 "Woe to you experts in the law! You
have taken away the key of knowledge!
You didn't go in yourselves, and you
hindered those who were going in."
53 When He le there, the scribes and
the Pharisees began to oppose Him
ﬁercely and to cross-examine Him about
many things;
54 they were lying in wait for Him to
trap Him in something He said.
1 In these circumstances, a
crowd of many thousands came
together, so that they were trampling
on one another. He began to say to His
12LUKE 12
91
disciples ﬁrst: "Be on your guard against
the yeast of the Pharisees, which is
hypocrisy.
2 There is nothing covered that won't
be uncovered, nothing hidden that won't
be made known.
3 Therefore whatever you have said in
the dark will be heard in the light, and
what you have whispered in an ear in
private rooms will be proclaimed on the
housetops.
4 "And I say to you, My friends, don't
fear those who kill the body, and a er
that can do nothing more.
5 But I will show you the One to fear:
Fear Him who has authority to throw
people into hell a er death. Yes, I say to
you, this is the One to fear!
6 Aren't ﬁve sparrows sold for two
pennies? Yet not one of them is forgo en
in God's sight.LUKE 12
92
7 Indeed, the hairs of your head are all
counted. Don't be afraid; you are worth
more than many sparrows!
8 "And I say to you, anyone who
acknowledges Me before men, the Son
of Man will also acknowledge him before
the angels of God,
9 but whoever denies Me before men
will be denied before the angels of God.
10 Anyone who speaks a word against
the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the
one who blasphemes against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven.
11 Whenever they bring you before
synagogues and rulers and authori es,
don't worry about how you should
defend yourselves or what you should
say.
12 For the Holy Spirit will teach you at
that very hour what must be said."LUKE 12
93
13 Someone from the crowd said to
Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide
the inheritance with me."
14 "Friend," He said to him, "who
appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over
you?"
15 He then told them, "Watch out and
be on guard against all greed because
one's life is not in the abundance of his
possessions."
16 Then He told them a parable: "A rich
man's land was very produc ve.
17 He thought to himself, 'What should I
do, since I don't have anywhere to store
my crops?
18 I will do this,' he said. 'I'll tear down
my barns and build bigger ones, and
store all my grain and my goods there.
19 Then I'll say to myself, "You have
many goods stored up for many years.
Take it easy; eat, drink, and enjoy
yourself."'LUKE 12
94
20 "But God said to him, 'You fool!
This very night your life is demanded
of you. And the things you have
prepared--whose will they be?'
21 "That's how it is with the one who
stores up treasure for himself and is not
rich toward God."
22 Then He said to His disciples:
"Therefore I tell you, don't worry about
your life, what you will eat; or about the
body, what you will wear.
23 For life is more than food and the
body more than clothing.
24 Consider the ravens: they don't sow
or reap; they don't have a storeroom or
a barn; yet God feeds them. Aren't you
worth much more than the birds?
25 Can any of you add a cubit to his
height by worrying?
26 If then you're not able to do even a
li le thing, why worry about the rest?LUKE 12
95
27 "Consider how the wildﬂowers grow:
they don't labor or spin thread. Yet I tell
you, not even Solomon in all his splendor
was adorned like one of these!
28 If that's how God clothes the grass,
which is in the ﬁeld today and is thrown
into the furnace tomorrow, how much
more will He do for you--you of li le
faith?
29 Don't keep striving for what you
should eat and what you should drink,
and don't be anxious.
30 For the Gen le world eagerly seeks
all these things, and your Father knows
that you need them.
31 "But seek His kingdom, and these
things will be provided for you.
32 Don't be afraid, li le ﬂock, because
your Father delights to give you the
kingdom.
33 Sell your possessions and give to the
poor. Make money-bags for yourselvesLUKE 12
96
that won't grow old, an inexhaus ble
treasure in heaven, where no thief
comes near and no moth destroys.
34 For where your treasure is, there
your heart will be also.
35 "Be ready for service and have your
lamps lit.
36 You must be like people wai ng for
their master to return from the wedding
banquet so that when he comes and
knocks, they can open the door for him
at once.
37 Those slaves the master will ﬁnd alert
when he comes will be blessed. I assure
you: He will get ready, have them recline
at the table, then come and serve them.
38 If he comes in the middle of the
night, or even near dawn, and ﬁnds
them alert, those slaves are blessed.
39 But know this: if the homeowner
had known at what hour the thief wasLUKE 12
97
coming, he would not have let his house
be broken into.
40 You also be ready, because the Son
of Man is coming at an hour that you do
not expect."
41 "Lord," Peter asked, "are You telling
this parable to us or to everyone?"
42 The Lord said: "Who then is the
faithful and sensible manager his master
will put in charge of his household
servants to give them their allo ed food
at the proper me?
43 That slave whose master ﬁnds
him working when he comes will be
rewarded.
44 I tell you the truth: he will put him in
charge of all his possessions.
45 But if that slave says in his heart, 'My
master is delaying his coming,' and starts
to beat the male and female slaves, and
to eat and drink and get drunk,LUKE 12
98
46 that slave's master will come on a
day he does not expect him and at an
hour he does not know. He will cut him
to pieces and assign him a place with the
unbelievers.
47 And that slave who knew his master's
will and didn't prepare himself or do it
will be severely beaten.
48 But the one who did not know and
did things deserving of blows will be
beaten lightly. Much will be required of
everyone who has been given much.
And even more will be expected of the
one who has been entrusted with more.
49 "I came to bring ﬁre on the earth, and
how I wish it were already set ablaze!
50 But I have a bap sm to be bap zed
with, and how it consumes Me un l it is
ﬁnished!
51 Do you think that I came here to give
peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but
rather division!LUKE 12
99
52 From now on, ﬁve in one household
will be divided: three against two, and
two against three.
53 They will be divided, father against
son, son against father, mother against
daughter, daughter against mother,
mother-in-law against her daughter-
in-law, and daughter-in-law against
mother-in-law. "
54 He also said to the crowds: "When
you see a cloud rising in the west, right
away you say, 'A storm is coming,' and so
it does.
55 And when the south wind is blowing,
you say, 'It's going to be a scorcher!' and
it is.
56 Hypocrites! You know how to
interpret the appearance of the earth
and the sky, but why don't you know
how to interpret this me?
57 "Why don't you judge for yourselves
what is right?LUKE 12 – 13
100
58 As you are going with your adversary
to the ruler, make an eﬀort to se le with
him on the way. Then he won't drag you
before the judge, the judge hand you
over to the bailiﬀ, and the bailiﬀ throw
you into prison.
59 I tell you, you will never get out of
there un l you have paid the last cent."
1 At that me, some people came
and reported to Him about the
Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed
with their sacriﬁces.
2 And He responded to them, "Do you
think that these Galileans were more
sinful than all Galileans because they
suﬀered these things?
3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent,
you will all perish as well!
4 Or those 18 that the tower in Siloam
fell on and killed--do you think they were
more sinful than all the people who live
in Jerusalem?
13LUKE 13
101
5 No, I tell you; but unless you repent,
you will all perish as well!"
6 And He told this parable: "A man
had a ﬁg tree that was planted in his
vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it
and found none.
7 He told the vineyard worker, 'Listen,
for three years I have come looking for
fruit on this ﬁg tree and haven't found
any. Cut it down! Why should it even
waste the soil?'
8 "But he replied to him, 'Sir, leave it
this year also, un l I dig around it and
fer lize it.
9 Perhaps it will bear fruit next year, but
if not, you can cut it down.'"
10 As He was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the Sabbath,
11 a woman was there who had been
disabled by a spirit for over 18 years. She
was bent over and could not straighten
up at all.LUKE 13
102
12 When Jesus saw her, He called out
to her, "Woman, you are free of your
disability."
13 Then He laid His hands on her, and
instantly she was restored and began to
glorify God.
14 But the leader of the synagogue,
indignant because Jesus had healed on
the Sabbath, responded by telling the
crowd, "There are six days when work
should be done; therefore come on
those days and be healed and not on the
Sabbath day."
15 But the Lord answered him and said,
"Hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you
un e his ox or donkey from the feeding
trough on the Sabbath, and lead it to
water?
16 Satan has bound this woman, a
daughter of Abraham, for 18 years-
-shouldn't she be un ed from this
bondage on the Sabbath day?"LUKE 13
103
17 When He had said these things, all
His adversaries were humiliated, but the
whole crowd was rejoicing over all the
glorious things He was doing.
18 He said therefore, "What is the
kingdom of God like, and what can I
compare it to?
19 It's like a mustard seed that a man
took and sowed in his garden. It grew
and became a tree, and the birds of the
sky nested in its branches."
20 Again He said, "What can I compare
the kingdom of God to?
21 It's like yeast that a woman took and
mixed into 50 pounds of ﬂour un l it
spread through the en re mixture."
22 He went through one town and
village a er another, teaching and
making His way to Jerusalem.
23 "Lord," someone asked Him, "are
there few being saved?" He said to them,LUKE 13
104
24 "Make every eﬀort to enter through
the narrow door, because I tell you,
many will try to enter and won't be able
25 once the homeowner gets up and
shuts the door. Then you will stand
outside and knock on the door, saying,
'Lord, open up for us!' He will answer
you, 'I don't know you or where you're
from.'
26 Then you will say, 'We ate and drank
in Your presence, and You taught in our
streets!'
27 But He will say, 'I tell you, I don't
know you or where you're from. Get
away from Me, all you workers of
unrighteousness!'
28 There will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth in that place, when you see
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets in the kingdom of God but
yourselves thrown out.LUKE 13
105
29 They will come from east and west,
from north and south, and recline at the
table in the kingdom of God.
30 Note this: some are last who will be
ﬁrst, and some are ﬁrst who will be last."
31 At that me some Pharisees came
and told Him, "Go, get out of here!
Herod wants to kill You!"
32 He said to them, "Go tell that
fox, 'Look! I'm driving out demons
and performing healings today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will
complete My work.'
33 Yet I must travel today, tomorrow,
and the next day, because it is not
possible for a prophet to perish outside
of Jerusalem!
34 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The city who
kills the prophets and stones those who

1 One Sabbath, when He went
to eat at the house of one of the
leading Pharisees, they were watching
Him closely.
2 There in front of Him was a man
whose body was swollen with ﬂuid.
3 In response, Jesus asked the law
experts and the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to
heal on the Sabbath or not?"
4 But they kept silent. He took the man,
healed him, and sent him away.
5 And to them, He said, "Which of you
whose son or ox falls into a well, will not
immediately pull him out on the Sabbath
day?"
6 To this they could ﬁnd no answer.
14LUKE 14
107
7 He told a parable to those who
were invited, when He no ced how
they would choose the best places for
themselves:
8 "When you are invited by someone to
a wedding banquet, don't recline at the
best place, because a more dis nguished
person than you may have been invited
by your host.
9 The one who invited both of you may
come and say to you, 'Give your place to
this man,' and then in humilia on, you
will proceed to take the lowest place.
10 "But when you are invited, go and
recline in the lowest place, so that when
the one who invited you comes, he will
say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' You
will then be honored in the presence of
all the other guests.
11 For everyone who exalts himself will
be humbled, and the one who humbles
himself will be exalted."LUKE 14
108
12 He also said to the one who had
invited Him, "When you give a lunch or
a dinner, don't invite your friends, your
brothers, your rela ves, or your rich
neighbors, because they might invite
you back, and you would be repaid.
13 On the contrary, when you host a
banquet, invite those who are poor,
maimed, lame, or blind.
14 And you will be blessed, because they
cannot repay you; for you will be repaid
at the resurrec on of the righteous."
15 When one of those who reclined at
the table with Him heard these things,
he said to Him, "The one who will eat
bread in the kingdom of God is blessed!"
16 Then He told him: "A man was giving
a large banquet and invited many.
17 At the me of the banquet, he sent
his slave to tell those who were invited,
'Come, because everything is now
ready.'LUKE 14
18 "But without excep
109
on they all began
to make excuses. The ﬁrst one said to
him, 'I have bought a ﬁeld, and I must go
out and see it. I ask you to excuse me.'
19 "Another said, 'I have bought ﬁve
yoke of oxen, and I'm going to try them
out. I ask you to excuse me.'
20 "And another said, 'I just got married,
and therefore I'm unable to come.'
21 "So the slave came back and reported
these things to his master. Then in anger,
the master of the house told his slave,
'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys
of the city, and bring in here the poor,
maimed, blind, and lame!'
22 "'Master,' the slave said, 'what you
ordered has been done, and there's s ll
room.'
23 "Then the master told the slave, 'Go
out into the highways and lanes and
make them come in, so that my house
may be ﬁlled.LUKE 14
110
24 For I tell you, not one of those
men who were invited will enjoy my
banquet!'"
25 Now great crowds were traveling
with Him. So He turned and said to
them:
26 "If anyone comes to Me and does not
hate his own father and mother, wife
and children, brothers and sisters--yes,
and even his own life--he cannot be My
disciple.
27 Whoever does not bear his own
cross and come a er Me cannot be My
disciple.
28 "For which of you, wan ng to build
a tower, doesn't ﬁrst sit down and
calculate the cost to see if he has enough
to complete it?
29 Otherwise, a er he has laid the
founda on and cannot ﬁnish it, all the
onlookers will begin to make fun of him,LUKE 14 – 15
111
30 saying, 'This man started to build and
wasn't able to ﬁnish.'
31 "Or what king, going to war against
another king, will not ﬁrst sit down
and decide if he is able with 10,000 to
oppose the one who comes against him
with 20,000?
32 If not, while the other is s ll far oﬀ,
he sends a delega on and asks for terms
of peace.
33 In the same way, therefore, every
one of you who does not say good-bye
to all his possessions cannot be My
disciple.
34 "Now, salt is good, but if salt should
lose its taste, how will it be made salty?
35 It isn't ﬁt for the soil or for the
manure pile; they throw it out. Anyone
who has ears to hear should listen!"
1 All the tax collectors and sinners
were approaching to listen to
Him.
15LUKE 15
112
2 And the Pharisees and scribes were
complaining, "This man welcomes
sinners and eats with them!"
3 So He told them this parable:
4 "What man among you, who has 100
sheep and loses one of them, does not
leave the 99 in the open ﬁeld and go
a er the lost one un l he ﬁnds it?
5 When he has found it, he joyfully puts
it on his shoulders,
6 and coming home, he calls his friends
and neighbors together, saying to them,
'Rejoice with me, because I have found
my lost sheep!'
7 I tell you, in the same way, there will
be more joy in heaven over one sinner
who repents than over 99 righteous
people who don't need repentance.
8 "Or what woman who has 10 silver
coins, if she loses one coin, does not light
a lamp, sweep the house, and search
carefully un l she ﬁnds it?LUKE 15
113
9 When she ﬁnds it, she calls her
women friends and neighbors together,
saying, 'Rejoice with me, because I have
found the silver coin I lost!'
10 I tell you, in the same way, there is
joy in the presence of God's angels over
one sinner who repents."
11 He also said: "A man had two sons.
12 The younger of them said to his
father, 'Father, give me the share of
the estate I have coming to me.' So he
distributed the assets to them.
13 Not many days later, the younger
son gathered together all he had and
traveled to a distant country, where he
squandered his estate in foolish living.
14 A er he had spent everything, a
severe famine struck that country, and
he had nothing.
15 Then he went to work for one of the
ci zens of that country, who sent him
into his ﬁelds to feed pigs.LUKE 15
114
16 He longed to eat his ﬁll from the
carob pods the pigs were ea ng, but no
one would give him any.
17 When he came to his senses, he said,
'How many of my father's hired hands
have more than enough food, and here I
am dying of hunger!
18 I'll get up, go to my father, and say to
him, Father, I have sinned against heaven
and in your sight.
19 I'm no longer worthy to be called
your son. Make me like one of your hired
hands.'
20 So he got up and went to his father.
But while the son was s ll a long way
oﬀ, his father saw him and was ﬁlled
with compassion. He ran, threw his arms
around his neck, and kissed him.
21 The son said to him, 'Father, I have
sinned against heaven and in your sight.
I'm no longer worthy to be called your
son.'LUKE 15
115
22 "But the father told his slaves, 'Quick!
Bring out the best robe and put it on
him; put a ring on his ﬁnger and sandals
on his feet.
23 Then bring the fa ened calf and
slaughter it, and let's celebrate with a
feast,
24 because this son of mine was dead
and is alive again; he was lost and is
found!' So they began to celebrate.
25 "Now his older son was in the ﬁeld;
as he came near the house, he heard
music and dancing.
26 So he summoned one of the servants
and asked what these things meant.
27 'Your brother is here,' he told him,
'and your father has slaughtered the
fa ened calf because he has him back
safe and sound.'
28 "Then he became angry and didn't
want to go in. So his father came out and
pleaded with him.LUKE 15 – 16
116
29 But he replied to his father, 'Look, I
have been slaving many years for you,
and I have never disobeyed your orders,
yet you never gave me a young goat so I
could celebrate with my friends.
30 But when this son of yours came,
who has devoured your assets with
pros tutes, you slaughtered the fa ened
calf for him.'
31 "'Son,' he said to him, 'you are always
with me, and everything I have is yours.
32 But we had to celebrate and rejoice,
because this brother of yours was dead
and is alive again; he was lost and is
found.'"
1 He also said to the disciples:
"There was a rich man who
received an accusa on that his manager
was squandering his possessions.
2 So he called the manager in and asked,
'What is this I hear about you? Give an
16LUKE 16
117
account of your management, because
you can no longer be my manager.'
3 "Then the manager said to himself,
'What should I do, since my master
is taking the management away from
me? I'm not strong enough to dig; I'm
ashamed to beg.
4 I know what I'll do so that when I'm
removed from management, people will
welcome me into their homes.'
5 "So he summoned each one of his
master's debtors. 'How much do you
owe my master?' he asked the ﬁrst one.
6 "'A hundred measures of oil,' he said.
"'Take your invoice,' he told him, 'sit
down quickly, and write 50.'
7 "Next he asked another, 'How much
do you owe?' "'A hundred measures of
wheat,' he said. "'Take your invoice,' he
told him, 'and write 80.'
8 "The master praised the unrighteous
manager because he had acted astutely.LUKE 16
118
For the sons of this age are more astute
than the sons of light in dealing with
their own people.
9 And I tell you, make friends for
yourselves by means of the unrighteous
money so that when it fails, they may
welcome you into eternal dwellings.
10 Whoever is faithful in very li le
is also faithful in much, and whoever
is unrighteous in very li le is also
unrighteous in much.
11 So if you have not been faithful with
the unrighteous money, who will trust
you with what is genuine?
12 And if you have not been faithful
with what belongs to someone else, who
will give you what is your own?
13 No household slave can be the slave
of two masters, since either he will hate
one and love the other, or he will be
devoted to one and despise the other.LUKE 16
119
You can't be slaves to both God and
money."
14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of
money, were listening to all these things
and scoﬃng at Him.
15 And He told them: "You are the ones
who jus fy yourselves in the sight of
others, but God knows your hearts.
For what is highly admired by people is
revol ng in God's sight.
16 "The Law and the Prophets were un l
John; since then, the good news of the
kingdom of God has been proclaimed,
and everyone is strongly urged to enter
it.
17 But it is easier for heaven and earth
to pass away than for one stroke of a
le er in the law to drop out.
18 "Everyone who divorces his wife
and marries another woman commits
adultery, and everyone who marriesLUKE 16
120
a woman divorced from her husband
commits adultery.
19 "There was a rich man who would
dress in purple and ﬁne linen, feas ng
lavishly every day.
20 But a poor man named Lazarus,
covered with sores, was le at his gate.
21 He longed to be ﬁlled with what fell
from the rich man's table, but instead
the dogs would come and lick his sores.
22 One day the poor man died and was
carried away by the angels to Abraham's
side. The rich man also died and was
buried.
23 And being in torment in Hades, he
looked up and saw Abraham a long way
oﬀ, with Lazarus at his side.
24 'Father Abraham!' he called out,
'Have mercy on me and send Lazarus to
dip the p of his ﬁnger in water and cool
my tongue, because I am in agony in this
ﬂame!'LUKE 16
121
25 "'Son,' Abraham said, 'remember
that during your life you received your
good things, just as Lazarus received bad
things, but now he is comforted here,
while you are in agony.
26 Besides all this, a great chasm has
been ﬁxed between us and you, so that
those who want to pass over from here
to you cannot; neither can those from
there cross over to us.'
27 "'Father,' he said, 'then I beg you to
send him to my father's house--
28 because I have ﬁve brothers--to warn
them, so they won't also come to this
place of torment.'
29 "But Abraham said, 'They have Moses
and the prophets; they should listen to
them.'
30 "'No, father Abraham,' he said. 'But
if someone from the dead goes to them,
they will repent.'LUKE 16 – 17
122
31 "But he told him, 'If they don't listen
to Moses and the prophets, they will not
be persuaded if someone rises from the
dead.'"
1 He said to His disciples,
"Oﬀenses will certainly come, but
woe to the one they come through!
2 It would be be er for him if a
millstone were hung around his neck
and he were thrown into the sea than
for him to cause one of these li le ones
to stumble.
3 Be on your guard. If your brother sins,
rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive
him.
4 And if he sins against you seven mes
in a day, and comes back to you seven
mes, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive
him."
5 The apostles said to the Lord,
"Increase our faith."
17LUKE 17
123
6 "If you have faith the size of a mustard
seed," the Lord said, "you can say to this
mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted
in the sea,' and it will obey you.
7 "Which one of you having a slave
plowing or tending sheep, will say to him
when he comes in from the ﬁeld, 'Come
at once and sit down to eat'?
8 Instead, will he not tell him, 'Prepare
something for me to eat, get ready, and
serve me while I eat and drink; later you
can eat and drink'?
9 Does he thank that slave because he
did what was commanded?
10 In the same way, when you have
done all that you were commanded, you
should say, 'We are good-for-nothing
slaves; we've only done our duty.'"
11 While traveling to Jerusalem, He
passed between Samaria and Galilee.LUKE 17
124
12 As He entered a village, 10 men with
serious skin diseases met Him. They
stood at a distance
13 and raised their voices, saying,
"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
14 When He saw them, He told them,
"Go and show yourselves to the priests."
And while they were going, they were
healed.
15 But one of them, seeing that he was
healed, returned and, with a loud voice,
gave glory to God.
16 He fell facedown at His feet, thanking
Him. And he was a Samaritan.
17 Then Jesus said, "Were not 10
cleansed? Where are the nine?
18 Didn't any return to give glory to God
except this foreigner?"
19 And He told him, "Get up and go on
your way. Your faith has made you well."
20 Being asked by the Pharisees when
the kingdom of God will come, HeLUKE 17
125
answered them, "The kingdom of God is
not coming with something observable;
21 no one will say, 'Look here!' or
'There!' For you see, the kingdom of God
is among you."
22 Then He told the disciples: "The days
are coming when you will long to see
one of the days of the Son of Man, but
you won't see it.
23 They will say to you, 'Look there!'
or 'Look here!' Don't follow or run a er
them.
24 For as the lightning ﬂashes from
horizon to horizon and lights up the sky,
so the Son of Man will be in His day.
25 But ﬁrst He must suﬀer many things
and be rejected by this genera on.
26 "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so
it will be in the days of the Son of Man:
27 people went on ea ng, drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage un l theLUKE 17
126
day Noah boarded the ark, and the ﬂood
came and destroyed them all.
28 It will be the same as it was in the
days of Lot: people went on ea ng,
drinking, buying, selling, plan ng,
building.
29 But on the day Lot le Sodom, ﬁre
and sulfur rained from heaven and
destroyed them all.
30 It will be like that on the day the Son
of Man is revealed.
31 On that day, a man on the housetop,
whose belongings are in the house, must
not come down to get them. Likewise
the man who is in the ﬁeld must not turn
back.
32 Remember Lot's wife!
33 Whoever tries to make his life secure
will lose it, and whoever loses his life will
preserve it.LUKE 17 – 18
127
34 I tell you, on that night two will be in
one bed: one will be taken and the other
will be le .
35 Two women will be grinding grain
together: one will be taken and the other
le .
36 [Two will be in a ﬁeld: one will be
taken, and the other will be le ."]
37 "Where, Lord?" they asked Him. He
said to them, "Where the corpse is,
there also the vultures will be gathered."
1 He then told them a parable on
the need for them to pray always
and not become discouraged:
2 "There was a judge in one town who
didn't fear God or respect man.
3 And a widow in that town kept coming
to him, saying, 'Give me jus ce against
my adversary.'
4 "For a while he was unwilling, but
later he said to himself, 'Even though I
don't fear God or respect man,
18LUKE 18
128
5 yet because this widow keeps
pestering me, I will give her jus ce,
so she doesn't wear me out by her
persistent coming.'"
6 Then the Lord said, "Listen to what
the unjust judge says.
7 Will not God grant jus ce to His elect
who cry out to Him day and night? Will
He delay to help them?
8 I tell you that He will swi ly grant
them jus ce. Nevertheless, when the
Son of Man comes, will He ﬁnd that faith
on earth?"
9 He also told this parable to some who
trusted in themselves that they were
righteous and looked down on everyone
else:
10 "Two men went up to the temple
complex to pray, one a Pharisee and the
other a tax collector.
11 The Pharisee took his stand and
was praying like this: 'God, I thank YouLUKE 18
129
that I'm not like other people--greedy,
unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this
tax collector.
12 I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of
everything I get.'
13 "But the tax collector, standing far
oﬀ, would not even raise his eyes to
heaven but kept striking his chest and
saying, 'God, turn Your wrath from me--a
sinner!'
14 I tell you, this one went down to his
house jus ﬁed rather than the other;
because everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, but the one who
humbles himself will be exalted."
15 Some people were even bringing
infants to Him so He might touch them,
but when the disciples saw it, they
rebuked them.
16 Jesus, however, invited them: "Let
the li le children come to Me, and don'tLUKE 18
130
stop them, because the kingdom of God
belongs to such as these.
17 I assure you: Whoever does not
welcome the kingdom of God like a li le
child will never enter it."
18 A ruler asked Him, "Good Teacher,
what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
19 "Why do you call Me good?"
Jesus asked him. "No one is good but
One--God.
20 You know the commandments: Do
not commit adultery; do not murder;
do not steal; do not bear false witness;
honor your father and mother. "
21 "I have kept all these from my youth,"
he said.
22 When Jesus heard this, He told him,
"You s ll lack one thing: sell all that you
have and distribute it to the poor, and
you will have treasure in heaven. Then
come, follow Me."LUKE 18
23 A
131
er he heard this, he became
extremely sad, because he was very rich.
24 Seeing that he became sad, Jesus
said, "How hard it is for those who have
wealth to enter the kingdom of God!
25 For it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for
a rich person to enter the kingdom of
God."
26 Those who heard this asked, "Then
who can be saved?"
27 He replied, "What is impossible with
men is possible with God."
28 Then Peter said, "Look, we have le
what we had and followed You."
29 So He said to them, "I assure you:
There is no one who has le a house,
wife or brothers, parents or children
because of the kingdom of God,
30 who will not receive many mes
more at this me, and eternal life in the
age to come."LUKE 18
132
31 Then He took the Twelve aside and
told them, "Listen! We are going up to
Jerusalem. Everything that is wri en
through the prophets about the Son of
Man will be accomplished.
32 For He will be handed over to
the Gen les, and He will be mocked,
insulted, spit on;
33 and a er they ﬂog Him, they will kill
Him, and He will rise on the third day."
34 They understood none of these
things. This saying was hidden from
them, and they did not grasp what was
said.
35 As He drew near Jericho, a blind man
was si ng by the road begging.
36 Hearing a crowd passing by, he
inquired what this meant.
37 "Jesus the Nazarene is passing by,"
they told him.
38 So he called out, "Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!"LUKE 18 – 19
133
39 Then those in front told him to keep
quiet, but he kept crying out all the
more, "Son of David, have mercy on
me!"
40 Jesus stopped and commanded that
he be brought to Him. When he drew
near, He asked him,
41 "What do you want Me to do for
you?" "Lord," he said, "I want to see!"
42 "Receive your sight!" Jesus told him.
"Your faith has healed you."
43 Instantly he could see, and he began
to follow Him, glorifying God. All the
people, when they saw it, gave praise to
God.
1 He entered Jericho and was
passing through.
2 There was a man named Zacchaeus
who was a chief tax collector, and he was
rich.
19LUKE 19
134
3 He was trying to see who Jesus was,
but he was not able because of the
crowd, since he was a short man.
4 So running ahead, he climbed up a
sycamore tree to see Jesus, since He was
about to pass that way.
5 When Jesus came to the place, He
looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus,
hurry and come down, because today I
must stay at your house."
6 So he quickly came down and
welcomed Him joyfully.
7 All who saw it began to complain,
"He's gone to lodge with a sinful man!"
8 But Zacchaeus stood there and said
to the Lord, "Look, I'll give half of my
possessions to the poor, Lord! And if I
have extorted anything from anyone, I'll
pay back four mes as much!"
9 "Today salva on has come to this
house," Jesus told him, "because he too
is a son of Abraham.LUKE 19
135
10 For the Son of Man has come to seek
and to save the lost."
11 As they were listening to this, He
went on to tell a parable because He
was near Jerusalem, and they thought
the kingdom of God was going to appear
right away.
12 Therefore He said: "A nobleman
traveled to a far country to receive for
himself authority to be king and then
return.
13 He called 10 of his slaves, gave them
10 minas, and told them, 'Engage in
business un l I come back.'
14 "But his subjects hated him and sent
a delega on a er him, saying, 'We don't
want this man to rule over us!'
15 "At his return, having received the
authority to be king, he summoned
those slaves he had given the money to
so he could ﬁnd out how much they had
made in business.LUKE 19
136
16 The ﬁrst came forward and said,
'Master, your mina has earned 10 more
minas.'
17 "'Well done, good slave!' he told him.
'Because you have been faithful in a very
small ma er, have authority over 10
towns.'
18 "The second came and said, 'Master,
your mina has made ﬁve minas.'
19 "So he said to him, 'You will be over
ﬁve towns.'
20 "And another came and said, 'Master,
here is your mina. I have kept it hidden
away in a cloth
21 because I was afraid of you, for you're
a tough man: you collect what you didn't
deposit and reap what you didn't sow.'
22 "He told him, 'I will judge you by
what you have said, you evil slave! If you
knew I was a tough man, collec ng what
I didn't deposit and reaping what I didn't
sow,LUKE 19
137
23 why didn't you put my money in the
bank? And when I returned, I would
have collected it with interest!'
24 So he said to those standing there,
'Take the mina away from him and give
it to the one who has 10 minas.'
25 "But they said to him, 'Master, he has
10 minas.'
26 "'I tell you, that to everyone who has,
more will be given; and from the one
who does not have, even what he does
have will be taken away.
27 But bring here these enemies of
mine, who did not want me to rule
over them, and slaughter them in my
presence.'"
28 When He had said these things, He
went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29 As He approached Bethphage and
Bethany, at the place called the Mount
of Olives, He sent two of the disciplesLUKE 19
138
30 and said, "Go into the village ahead
of you. As you enter it, you will ﬁnd a
young donkey ed there, on which no
one has ever sat. Un e it and bring it
here.
31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you
untying it?' say this: 'The Lord needs it.'"
32 So those who were sent le and
found it just as He had told them.
33 As they were untying the young
donkey, its owners said to them, "Why
are you untying the donkey?"
34 "The Lord needs it," they said.
35 Then they brought it to Jesus, and
a er throwing their robes on the donkey,
they helped Jesus get on it.
36 As He was going along, they were
spreading their robes on the road.
37 Now He came near the path down
the Mount of Olives, and the whole
crowd of the disciples began to praiseLUKE 19
139
God joyfully with a loud voice for all the
miracles they had seen:
38 Blessed is the King who comes in the
name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and
glory in the highest heaven!
39 Some of the Pharisees from the
crowd told Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your
disciples."
40 He answered, "I tell you, if they were
to keep silent, the stones would cry out!"
41 As He approached and saw the city,
He wept over it,
42 saying, "If you knew this day what
would bring peace--but now it is hidden
from your eyes.
43 For the days will come on you when
your enemies will build an embankment
against you, surround you, and hem you
in on every side.
44 They will crush you and your children
within you to the ground, and they will
not leave one stone on another in you,LUKE 19 – 20
140
because you did not recognize the me
of your visita on."
45 He went into the temple complex
and began to throw out those who were
selling,
46 and He said, "It is wri en, My house
will be a house of prayer, but you have
made it a den of thieves !"
47 Every day He was teaching in the
temple complex. The chief priests, the
scribes, and the leaders of the people
were looking for a way to destroy Him,
48 but they could not ﬁnd a way to do it,
because all the people were cap vated
by what they heard.
1 One day as He was teaching the
people in the temple complex
and proclaiming the good news, the
chief priests and the scribes, with the
elders, came up
20LUKE 20
141
2 and said to Him: "Tell us, by what
authority are You doing these things?
Who is it who gave You this authority?"
3 He answered them, "I will also ask you
a ques on. Tell Me,
4 was the bap sm of John from heaven
or from men?"
5 They discussed it among themselves:
"If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say,
'Why didn't you believe him?'
6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the
people will stone us, because they are
convinced that John was a prophet."
7 So they answered that they did not
know its origin.
8 And Jesus said to them, "Neither will
I tell you by what authority I do these
things."
9 Then He began to tell the people this
parable: "A man planted a vineyard,
leased it to tenant farmers, and went
away for a long me.LUKE 20
10 At harvest
142
me he sent a slave to
the farmers so that they might give him
some fruit from the vineyard. But the
farmers beat him and sent him away
empty-handed.
11 He sent yet another slave, but
they beat that one too, treated
him shamefully, and sent him away
empty-handed.
12 And he sent yet a third, but they
wounded this one too and threw him
out.
13 "Then the owner of the vineyard
said, 'What should I do? I will send my
beloved son. Perhaps they will respect
him.'
14 "But when the tenant farmers saw
him, they discussed it among themselves
and said, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him,
so the inheritance will be ours!'LUKE 20
143
15 So they threw him out of the vineyard
and killed him. "Therefore, what will the
owner of the vineyard do to them?
16 He will come and destroy those
farmers and give the vineyard to others."
But when they heard this they said,
"No--never!"
17 But He looked at them and
said, "Then what is the meaning of
this Scripture: The stone that the
builders rejected--this has become the
cornerstone ?
18 Everyone who falls on that stone will
be broken to pieces, and if it falls on
anyone, it will grind him to powder!"
19 Then the scribes and the chief priests
looked for a way to get their hands on
Him that very hour, because they knew
He had told this parable against them,
but they feared the people.
20 They watched closely and sent spies
who pretended to be righteous, so theyLUKE 20
144
could catch Him in what He said, to hand
Him over to the governor's rule and
authority.
21 They ques oned Him, "Teacher, we
know that You speak and teach correctly,
and You don't show par ality, but teach
truthfully the way of God.
22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to
Caesar or not?"
23 But detec ng their cra iness, He said
to them,
24 "Show Me a denarius. Whose image
and inscrip on does it have?" "Caesar's,"
they said.
25 "Well then," He told them, "give back
to Caesar the things that are Caesar's
and to God the things that are God's."
26 They were not able to catch Him
in what He said in public, and being
amazed at His answer, they became
silent.LUKE 20
145
27 Some of the Sadducees, who say
there is no resurrec on, came up and
ques oned Him:
28 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that
if a man's brother has a wife, and
dies childless, his brother should take
the wife and produce oﬀspring for his
brother.
29 Now there were seven brothers.
The ﬁrst took a wife and died without
children.
30 Also the second
31 and the third took her. In the same
way, all seven died and le no children.
32 Finally, the woman died too.
33 Therefore, in the resurrec on, whose
wife will the woman be? For all seven
had married her."
34 Jesus told them, "The sons of this age
marry and are given in marriage.
35 But those who are counted worthy
to take part in that age and in theLUKE 20
146
resurrec on from the dead neither
marry nor are given in marriage.
36 For they cannot die anymore,
because they are like angels and are
sons of God, since they are sons of the
resurrec on.
37 Moses even indicated in the passage
about the burning bush that the dead
are raised, where he calls the Lord the
God of Abraham and the God of Isaac
and the God of Jacob.
38 He is not God of the dead but of the
living, because all are living to Him."
39 Some of the scribes answered,
"Teacher, You have spoken well."
40 And they no longer dared to ask Him
anything.
41 Then He said to them, "How can they
say that the Messiah is the Son of David?
42 For David himself says in the Book of
Psalms: The Lord declared to my Lord,
'Sit at My right handLUKE 20 – 21
43 un
147
l I make Your enemies Your
footstool.'
44 David calls Him 'Lord'; how then can
the Messiah be his Son?"
45 While all the people were listening,
He said to His disciples,
46 "Beware of the scribes, who want to
go around in long robes and who love
gree ngs in the marketplaces, the front
seats in the synagogues, and the places
of honor at banquets.
47 They devour widows' houses and say
long prayers just for show. These will
receive greater punishment."
1 He looked up and saw the rich
dropping their oﬀerings into the
temple treasury.
2 He also saw a poor widow dropping in
two ny coins.
3 "I tell you the truth," He said. "This
poor widow has put in more than all of
them.
21LUKE 21
4 For all these people have put in gi
148
s
out of their surplus, but she out of her
poverty has put in all she had to live on."
5 As some were talking about the
temple complex, how it was adorned
with beau ful stones and gi s dedicated
to God, He said,
6 "These things that you see--the days
will come when not one stone will be
le on another that will not be thrown
down!"
7 "Teacher," they asked Him, "so when
will these things be? And what will be
the sign when these things are about to
take place?"
8 Then He said, "Watch out that you are
not deceived. For many will come in My
name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The me is
near.' Don't follow them.
9 When you hear of wars and rebellions,
don't be alarmed. Indeed, these thingsLUKE 21
149
must take place ﬁrst, but the end won't
come right away."
10 Then He told them: "Na on will be
raised up against na on, and kingdom
against kingdom.
11 There will be violent earthquakes,
and famines and plagues in various
places, and there will be terrifying sights
and great signs from heaven.
12 But before all these things, they will
lay their hands on you and persecute
you. They will hand you over to the
synagogues and prisons, and you will
be brought before kings and governors
because of My name.
13 It will lead to an opportunity for you
to witness.
14 Therefore make up your minds not to
prepare your defense ahead of me,
15 for I will give you such words and a
wisdom that none of your adversaries
will be able to resist or contradict.LUKE 21
150
16 You will even be betrayed by parents,
brothers, rela ves, and friends. They will
kill some of you.
17 You will be hated by everyone
because of My name,
18 but not a hair of your head will be
lost.
19 By your endurance gain your lives.
20 "When you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies, then recognize
that its desola on has come near.
21 Then those in Judea must ﬂee to
the mountains! Those inside the city
must leave it, and those who are in the
country must not enter it,
22 because these are days of vengeance
to fulﬁll all the things that are wri en.
23 Woe to pregnant women and nursing
mothers in those days, for there will
be great distress in the land and wrath
against this people.LUKE 21
151
24 They will fall by the edge of the sword
and be led cap ve into all the na ons,
and Jerusalem will be trampled by the
Gen les un l the mes of the Gen les
are fulﬁlled.
25 "Then there will be signs in the
sun, moon, and stars; and there will be
anguish on the earth among na ons
bewildered by the roaring sea and
waves.
26 People will faint from fear and
expecta on of the things that are
coming on the world, because the
celes al powers will be shaken.
27 Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great
glory.
28 But when these things begin to take
place, stand up and li up your heads,
because your redemp on is near!"
29 Then He told them a parable: "Look
at the ﬁg tree, and all the trees.LUKE 21
152
30 As soon as they put out leaves you
can see for yourselves and recognize
that summer is already near.
31 In the same way, when you see these
things happening, recognize that the
kingdom of God is near.
32 I assure you: This genera on will
certainly not pass away un l all things
take place.
33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but
My words will never pass away.
34 "Be on your guard, so that your
minds are not dulled from carousing,
drunkenness, and worries of life, or that
day will come on you unexpectedly
35 like a trap. For it will come on all who
live on the face of the whole earth.
36 But be alert at all mes, praying that
you may have strength to escape all
these things that are going to take place
and to stand before the Son of Man."LUKE 21 – 22
153
37 During the day, He was teaching in
the temple complex, but in the evening
He would go out and spend the night on
what is called the Mount of Olives.
38 Then all the people would come early
in the morning to hear Him in the temple
complex.
1 The Fes val of Unleavened
Bread, which is called Passover,
was drawing near.
2 The chief priests and the scribes were
looking for a way to put Him to death,
because they were afraid of the people.
3 Then Satan entered Judas, called
Iscariot, who was numbered among the
Twelve.
4 He went away and discussed with the
chief priests and temple police how he
could hand Him over to them.
5 They were glad and agreed to give
him silver.
22LUKE 22
154
6 So he accepted the oﬀer and started
looking for a good opportunity to betray
Him to them when the crowd was not
present.
7 Then the Day of Unleavened Bread
came when the Passover lamb had to be
sacriﬁced.
8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go
and prepare the Passover meal for us, so
we can eat it."
9 "Where do You want us to prepare
it?" they asked Him.
10 "Listen," He said to them, "when
you've entered the city, a man carrying a
water jug will meet you. Follow him into
the house he enters.
11 Tell the owner of the house, 'The
Teacher asks you, "Where is the guest
room where I can eat the Passover with
My disciples?"'LUKE 22
155
12 Then he will show you a large,
furnished room upstairs. Make the
prepara ons there."
13 So they went and found it just as He
had told them, and they prepared the
Passover.
14 When the hour came, He reclined at
the table, and the apostles with Him.
15 Then He said to them, "I have
fervently desired to eat this Passover
with you before I suﬀer.
16 For I tell you, I will not eat it again
un l it is fulﬁlled in the kingdom of God."
17 Then He took a cup, and a er giving
thanks, He said, "Take this and share it
among yourselves.
18 For I tell you, from now on I will not
drink of the fruit of the vine un l the
kingdom of God comes."
19 And He took bread, gave thanks,
broke it, gave it to them, and said, "ThisLUKE 22
156
is My body, which is given for you. Do
this in remembrance of Me."
20 In the same way He also took the cup
a er supper and said, "This cup is the
new covenant established by My blood;
it is shed for you.
21 But look, the hand of the one
betraying Me is at the table with Me!
22 For the Son of Man will go away as it
has been determined, but woe to that
man by whom He is betrayed!"
23 So they began to argue among
themselves which of them it could be
who was going to do this thing.
24 Then a dispute also arose among
them about who should be considered
the greatest.
25 But He said to them, "The kings of
the Gen les dominate them, and those
who have authority over them are called
'Benefactors.'LUKE 22
157
26 But it must not be like that among
you. On the contrary, whoever is
greatest among you must become like
the youngest, and whoever leads, like
the one serving.
27 For who is greater, the one at the
table or the one serving? Isn't it the one
at the table? But I am among you as the
One who serves.
28 You are the ones who stood by Me in
My trials.
29 I bestow on you a kingdom, just as
My Father bestowed one on Me,
30 so that you may eat and drink at My
table in My kingdom. And you will sit on
thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel.
31 "Simon, Simon, look out! Satan has
asked to si you like wheat.
32 But I have prayed for you that your
faith may not fail. And you, when you
have turned back, strengthen your
brothers."LUKE 22
158
33 "Lord," he told Him, "I'm ready to go
with You both to prison and to death!"
34 "I tell you, Peter," He said, "the
rooster will not crow today un l you
deny three mes that you know Me!"
35 He also said to them, "When I sent
you out without money-bag, traveling
bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?"
"Not a thing," they said.
36 Then He said to them, "But now,
whoever has a money-bag should take
it, and also a traveling bag. And whoever
doesn't have a sword should sell his robe
and buy one.
37 For I tell you, what is wri en must
be fulﬁlled in Me: And He was counted
among the outlaws. Yes, what is wri en
about Me is coming to its fulﬁllment."
38 "Lord," they said, "look, here are
two swords." "Enough of that!" He told
them.LUKE 22
159
39 He went out and made His way as
usual to the Mount of Olives, and the
disciples followed Him.
40 When He reached the place, He told
them, "Pray that you may not enter into
tempta on."
41 Then He withdrew from them about
a stone's throw, knelt down, and began
to pray,
42 "Father, if You are willing, take this
cup away from Me--nevertheless, not
My will, but Yours, be done."
43 [Then an angel from heaven
appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
44 Being in anguish, He prayed more
fervently, and His sweat became like
drops of blood falling to the ground.]
45 When He got up from prayer and
came to the disciples, He found them
sleeping, exhausted from their grief.LUKE 22
160
46 "Why are you sleeping?" He asked
them. "Get up and pray, so that you
won't enter into tempta on."
47 While He was s ll speaking, suddenly
a mob was there, and one of the Twelve
named Judas was leading them. He came
near Jesus to kiss Him,
48 but Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you
betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
49 When those around Him saw what
was going to happen, they asked, "Lord,
should we strike with the sword?"
50 Then one of them struck the high
priest's slave and cut oﬀ his right ear.
51 But Jesus responded, "No more of
this!" And touching his ear, He healed
him.
52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
temple police, and the elders who had
come for Him, "Have you come out with
swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?LUKE 22
161
53 Every day while I was with you in the
temple complex, you never laid a hand
on Me. But this is your hour--and the
dominion of darkness."
54 They seized Him, led Him away, and
brought Him into the high priest's house.
Meanwhile Peter was following at a
distance.
55 They lit a ﬁre in the middle of the
courtyard and sat down together, and
Peter sat among them.
56 When a servant saw him si ng in the
ﬁrelight, and looked closely at him, she
said, "This man was with Him too."
57 But he denied it: "Woman, I don't
know Him!"
58 A er a li le while, someone else saw
him and said, "You're one of them too!"
"Man, I am not!" Peter said.
59 About an hour later, another kept
insis ng, "This man was certainly with
Him, since he's also a Galilean."LUKE 22
162
60 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know
what you're talking about!" Immediately,
while he was s ll speaking, a rooster
crowed.
61 Then the Lord turned and looked at
Peter. So Peter remembered the word
of the Lord, how He had said to him,
"Before the rooster crows today, you will
deny Me three mes."
62 And he went outside and wept
bi erly.
63 The men who were holding Jesus
started mocking and bea ng Him.
64 A er blindfolding Him, they kept
asking, "Prophesy! Who hit You?"
65 And they were saying many other
blasphemous things against Him.
66 When daylight came, the elders of
the people, both the chief priests and
the scribes, convened and brought Him
before their Sanhedrin.LUKE 22 – 23
163
67 They said, "If You are the Messiah,
tell us." But He said to them, "If I do tell
you, you will not believe.
68 And if I ask you, you will not answer.
69 But from now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the Power
of God."
70 They all asked, "Are You, then, the
Son of God?" And He said to them, "You
say that I am."
71 "Why do we need any more
tes mony," they said, "since we've heard
it ourselves from His mouth?"
1 Then their whole assembly rose
up and brought Him before Pilate.
2 They began to accuse Him, saying,
"We found this man subver ng our
na on, opposing payment of taxes to
Caesar, and saying that He Himself is the
Messiah, a King."
23LUKE 23
164
3 So Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King
of the Jews?" He answered him, "You
have said it."
4 Pilate then told the chief priests
and the crowds, "I ﬁnd no grounds for
charging this man."
5 But they kept insis ng, "He s rs up
the people, teaching throughout all
Judea, from Galilee where He started
even to here."
6 When Pilate heard this, he asked if the
man was a Galilean.
7 Finding that He was under Herod's
jurisdic on, he sent Him to Herod, who
was also in Jerusalem during those days.
8 Herod was very glad to see Jesus;
for a long me he had wanted to see
Him, because he had heard about Him
and was hoping to see some miracle
performed by Him.
9 So he kept asking Him ques ons, but
Jesus did not answer him.LUKE 23
165
10 The chief priests and the scribes
stood by, vehemently accusing Him.
11 Then Herod, with his soldiers, treated
Him with contempt, mocked Him,
dressed Him in a brilliant robe, and sent
Him back to Pilate.
12 That very day Herod and Pilate
became friends. Previously, they had
been hos le toward each other.
13 Pilate called together the chief
priests, the leaders, and the people,
14 and said to them, "You have brought
me this man as one who subverts the
people. But in fact, a er examining
Him in your presence, I have found no
grounds to charge this man with those
things you accuse Him of.
15 Neither has Herod, because he sent
Him back to us. Clearly, He has done
nothing to deserve death.
16 Therefore I will have Him whipped
and then release Him."LUKE 23
17 [For according to the fes
166
val he had
to release someone to them.]
18 Then they all cried out together,
"Take this man away! Release Barabbas
to us!"
19 (He had been thrown into prison for
a rebellion that had taken place in the
city, and for murder.)
20 Pilate, wan ng to release Jesus,
addressed them again,
21 but they kept shou ng, "Crucify!
Crucify Him!"
22 A third me he said to them, "Why?
What has this man done wrong? I
have found in Him no grounds for the
death penalty. Therefore I will have Him
whipped and then release Him."
23 But they kept up the pressure,
demanding with loud voices that He be
cruciﬁed. And their voices won out.
24 So Pilate decided to grant their
demandLUKE 23
167
25 and released the one they were
asking for, who had been thrown into
prison for rebellion and murder. But he
handed Jesus over to their will.
26 As they led Him away, they seized
Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in
from the country, and laid the cross on
him to carry behind Jesus.
27 A great mul tude of the people
followed Him, including women who
were mourning and lamen ng Him.
28 But turning to them, Jesus said,
"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep
for Me, but weep for yourselves and
your children.
29 Look, the days are coming when they
will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the
wombs that never bore, and the breasts
that never nursed!'
30 Then they will begin to say to the
mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills,
'Cover us!'LUKE 23
168
31 For if they do these things when the
wood is green, what will happen when it
is dry?"
32 Two others--criminals--were also led
away to be executed with Him.
33 When they arrived at the place called
The Skull, they cruciﬁed Him there, along
with the criminals, one on the right and
one on the le .
34 [Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive
them, because they do not know what
they are doing."] And they divided His
clothes and cast lots.
35 The people stood watching, and even
the leaders kept scoﬃng: "He saved
others; let Him save Himself if this is
God's Messiah, the Chosen One!"
36 The soldiers also mocked Him. They
came oﬀering Him sour wine
37 and said, "If You are the King of the
Jews, save Yourself!"LUKE 23
38 An inscrip
169
on was above Him: THIS
IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
39 Then one of the criminals hanging
there began to yell insults at Him: "Aren't
You the Messiah? Save Yourself and us!"
40 But the other answered, rebuking
him: "Don't you even fear God, since you
are undergoing the same punishment?
41 We are punished justly, because
we're ge ng back what we deserve for
the things we did, but this man has done
nothing wrong."
42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
when You come into Your kingdom!"
43 And He said to him, "I assure you:
Today you will be with Me in paradise."
44 It was now about noon, and darkness
came over the whole land un l three,
45 because the sun's light failed. The
curtain of the sanctuary was split down
the middle.LUKE 23
170
46 And Jesus called out with a loud
voice, "Father, into Your hands I entrust
My spirit. " Saying this, He breathed His
last.
47 When the centurion saw what
happened, he began to glorify God,
saying, "This man really was righteous!"
48 All the crowds that had gathered for
this spectacle, when they saw what had
taken place, went home, striking their
chests.
49 But all who knew Him, including the
women who had followed Him from
Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
50 There was a good and righteous
man named Joseph, a member of the
Sanhedrin,
51 who had not agreed with their plan
and ac on. He was from Arimathea, a
Judean town, and was looking forward
to the kingdom of God.LUKE 23 – 24
171
52 He approached Pilate and asked for
Jesus' body.
53 Taking it down, he wrapped it in ﬁne
linen and placed it in a tomb cut into
the rock, where no one had ever been
placed.
54 It was prepara on day, and the
Sabbath was about to begin.
55 The women who had come with
Him from Galilee followed along and
observed the tomb and how His body
was placed.
56 Then they returned and prepared
spices and perfumes. And they rested
on the Sabbath according to the
commandment.
1 On the ﬁrst day of the week,
very early in the morning, they
came to the tomb, bringing the spices
they had prepared.
2 They found the stone rolled away
from the tomb.
24LUKE 24
172
3 They went in but did not ﬁnd the body
of the Lord Jesus.
4 While they were perplexed about this,
suddenly two men stood by them in
dazzling clothes.
5 So the women were terriﬁed and
bowed down to the ground. "Why are
you looking for the living among the
dead?" asked the men.
6 "He is not here, but He has been
resurrected! Remember how He spoke
to you when He was s ll in Galilee,
7 saying, 'The Son of Man must be
betrayed into the hands of sinful men,
be cruciﬁed, and rise on the third day'?"
8 And they remembered His words.
9 Returning from the tomb, they
reported all these things to the Eleven
and to all the rest.
10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the
mother of James, and the other womenLUKE 24
173
with them were telling the apostles
these things.
11 But these words seemed like
nonsense to them, and they did not
believe the women.
12 Peter, however, got up and ran to the
tomb. When he stooped to look in, he
saw only the linen cloths. So he went
home, amazed at what had happened.
13 Now that same day two of them
were on their way to a village called
Emmaus, which was about seven miles
from Jerusalem.
14 Together they were discussing
everything that had taken place.
15 And while they were discussing and
arguing, Jesus Himself came near and
began to walk along with them.
16 But they were prevented from
recognizing Him.
17 Then He asked them, "What is
this dispute that you're having withLUKE 24
174
each other as you are walking?" And
they stopped walking and looked
discouraged.
18 The one named Cleopas answered
Him, "Are You the only visitor in
Jerusalem who doesn't know the things
that happened there in these days?"
19 "What things?" He asked them. So
they said to Him, "The things concerning
Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet
powerful in ac on and speech before
God and all the people,
20 and how our chief priests and leaders
handed Him over to be sentenced to
death, and they cruciﬁed Him.
21 But we were hoping that He was the
One who was about to redeem Israel.
Besides all this, it's the third day since
these things happened.
22 Moreover, some women from our
group astounded us. They arrived early
at the tomb,LUKE 24
175
23 and when they didn't ﬁnd His body,
they came and reported that they had
seen a vision of angels who said He was
alive.
24 Some of those who were with us
went to the tomb and found it just as
the women had said, but they didn't see
Him."
25 He said to them, "How unwise and
slow you are to believe in your hearts all
that the prophets have spoken!
26 Didn't the Messiah have to suﬀer
these things and enter into His glory?"
27 Then beginning with Moses and all
the Prophets, He interpreted for them
the things concerning Himself in all the
Scriptures.
28 They came near the village where
they were going, and He gave the
impression that He was going farther.
29 But they urged Him: "Stay with us,
because it's almost evening, and nowLUKE 24
176
the day is almost over." So He went in to
stay with them.
30 It was as He reclined at the table with
them that He took the bread, blessed
and broke it, and gave it to them.
31 Then their eyes were opened,
and they recognized Him, but He
disappeared from their sight.
32 So they said to each other, "Weren't
our hearts ablaze within us while He
was talking with us on the road and
explaining the Scriptures to us?"
33 That very hour they got up and
returned to Jerusalem. They found the
Eleven and those with them gathered
together,
34 who said, "The Lord has certainly
been raised, and has appeared to
Simon!"
35 Then they began to describe what
had happened on the road and howLUKE 24
177
He was made known to them in the
breaking of the bread.
36 And as they were saying these things,
He Himself stood among them. He said
to them, "Peace to you!"
37 But they were startled and terriﬁed
and thought they were seeing a ghost.
38 "Why are you troubled?" He asked
them. "And why do doubts arise in your
hearts?
39 Look at My hands and My feet, that it
is I Myself! Touch Me and see, because a
ghost does not have ﬂesh and bones as
you can see I have."
40 Having said this, He showed them His
hands and feet.
41 But while they s ll could not believe
because of their joy and were amazed,
He asked them, "Do you have anything
here to eat?"
42 So they gave Him a piece of a broiled
ﬁsh,LUKE 24
178
43 and He took it and ate in their
presence.
44 Then He told them, "These are My
words that I spoke to you while I was s ll
with you--that everything wri en about
Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets,
and the Psalms must be fulﬁlled."
45 Then He opened their minds to
understand the Scriptures.
46 He also said to them, "This is what is
wri en: the Messiah would suﬀer and
rise from the dead the third day,
47 and repentance for forgiveness of
sins would be proclaimed in His name to
all the na ons, beginning at Jerusalem.
48 You are witnesses of these things.
49 And look, I am sending you what My
Father promised. As for you, stay in the
city un l you are empowered from on
high."LUKE 24
179
50 Then He led them out as far as
Bethany, and li ing up His hands He
blessed them.
51 And while He was blessing them,
He le them and was carried up into
heaven.
52 A er worshiping Him, they returned
to Jerusalem with great joy.
53 And they were con nually in the
temple complex blessing God.John
1
1 In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.
2 He was with God in the beginning.
3 All things were created through Him,
and apart from Him not one thing was
created that has been created.
4 Life was in Him, and that life was the
light of men.
5 That light shines in the darkness, yet
the darkness did not overcome it.
6 There was a man named John who
was sent from God.
7 He came as a witness to tes fy about
the light, so that all might believe
through him.
8 He was not the light, but he came to
tes fy about the light.JOHN 1
2
9 The true light, who gives light to
everyone, was coming into the world.
10 He was in the world, and the world
was created through Him, yet the world
did not recognize Him.
11 He came to His own, and His own
people did not receive Him.
12 But to all who did receive Him, He
gave them the right to be children of
God, to those who believe in His name,
13 who were born, not of blood, or of
the will of the ﬂesh, or of the will of man,
but of God.
14 The Word became ﬂesh and took up
residence among us. We observed His
glory, the glory as the One and Only Son
from the Father, full of grace and truth.
15 (John tes ﬁed concerning Him and
exclaimed, "This was the One of whom
I said, 'The One coming a er me has
surpassed me, because He existed
before me.'")JOHN 1
3
16 Indeed, we have all received grace
a er grace from His fullness,
17 for although the law was given
through Moses; grace and truth came
through Jesus Christ.
18 No one has ever seen God. The One
and Only Son--the One who is at the
Father's side--He has revealed Him.
19 This is John's tes mony when the
Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and
Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"
20 He did not refuse to answer, but he
declared: "I am not the Messiah."
21 "What then?" they asked him. "Are
you Elijah?" "I am not," he said. "Are you
the Prophet?" "No," he answered.
22 "Who are you, then?" they asked.
"We need to give an answer to those
who sent us. What can you tell us about
yourself?"
23 He said, "I am a voice of one crying
out in the wilderness: Make straightJOHN 1
4
the way of the Lord --just as Isaiah the
prophet said."
24 Now they had been sent from the
Pharisees.
25 So they asked him, "Why then do
you bap ze if you aren't the Messiah, or
Elijah, or the Prophet?"
26 "I bap ze with water," John answered
them. "Someone stands among you, but
you don't know Him .
27 He is the One coming a er me,
whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to
un e."
28 All this happened in Bethany across
the Jordan, where John was bap zing.
29 The next day John saw Jesus coming
toward him and said, "Here is the Lamb
of God, who takes away the sin of the
world!
30 This is the One I told you about: 'A er
me comes a man who has surpassed me,
because He existed before me.'JOHN 1
5
31 I didn't know Him, but I came
bap zing with water so He might be
revealed to Israel."
32 And John tes ﬁed, "I watched the
Spirit descending from heaven like a
dove, and He rested on Him.
33 I didn't know Him, but He who sent
me to bap ze with water told me, 'The
One you see the Spirit descending and
res ng on--He is the One who bap zes
with the Holy Spirit.'
34 I have seen and tes ﬁed that He is
the Son of God!"
35 Again the next day, John was standing
with two of his disciples.
36 When he saw Jesus passing by, he
said, "Look! The Lamb of God!"
37 The two disciples heard him say this
and followed Jesus.
38 When Jesus turned and no ced
them following Him, He asked them,
"What are you looking for?" They said toJOHN 1
6
Him, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"),
"where are You staying?"
39 "Come and you'll see," He replied.
So they went and saw where He was
staying, and they stayed with Him that
day. It was about 10 in the morning.
40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was
one of the two who heard John and
followed Him.
41 He ﬁrst found his own brother Simon
and told him, "We have found the
Messiah!" (which means "Anointed
One"),
42 and he brought Simon to Jesus.
When Jesus saw him, He said, "You are
Simon, son of John. You will be called
Cephas" (which means "Rock").
43 The next day He decided to leave for
Galilee. Jesus found Philip and told him,
"Follow Me!"
44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the
hometown of Andrew and Peter.JOHN 1
7
45 Philip found Nathanael and told
him, "We have found the One Moses
wrote about in the law (and so did the
prophets): Jesus the son of Joseph, from
Nazareth!"
46 "Can anything good come out of
Nazareth?" Nathanael asked him. "Come
and see," Philip answered.
47 Then Jesus saw Nathanael coming
toward Him and said about him, "Here is
a true Israelite; no deceit is in him."
48 "How do you know me?" Nathanael
asked. "Before Philip called you, when
you were under the ﬁg tree, I saw you,"
Jesus answered.
49 "Rabbi," Nathanael replied, "You
are the Son of God! You are the King of
Israel!"
50 Jesus responded to him, "Do you
believe only because I told you I saw you
under the ﬁg tree? You will see greater
things than this."JOHN 1 – 2
8
51 Then He said, "I assure you: You will
see heaven opened and the angels of
God ascending and descending on the
Son of Man."
1 On the third day a wedding took
place in Cana of Galilee. Jesus'
mother was there, and
2 Jesus and His disciples were invited to
the wedding as well.
3 When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother
told Him, "They don't have any wine."
4 "What has this concern of yours to
do with Me, woman?" Jesus asked. "My
hour has not yet come."
5 "Do whatever He tells you," His
mother told the servants.
6 Now six stone water jars had been
set there for Jewish puriﬁca on. Each
contained 20 or 30 gallons.
7 "Fill the jars with water," Jesus told
them. So they ﬁlled them to the brim.
2JOHN 2
9
8 Then He said to them, "Now draw
some out and take it to the chief
servant." And they did.
9 When the chief servant tasted the
water (a er it had become wine), he did
not know where it came from--though
the servants who had drawn the water
knew. He called the groom
10 and told him, "Everybody sets out
the ﬁne wine ﬁrst, then, a er people
have drunk freely, the inferior. But you
have kept the ﬁne wine un l now."
11 Jesus performed this ﬁrst sign in
Cana of Galilee. He displayed His glory,
and His disciples believed in Him.
12 A er this, He went down to
Capernaum, together with His mother,
His brothers, and His disciples, and they
stayed there only a few days.
13 The Jewish Passover was near, so
Jesus went up to Jerusalem.JOHN 2
10
14 In the temple complex He found
people selling oxen, sheep, and doves,
and He also found the money changers
si ng there.
15 A er making a whip out of cords,
He drove everyone out of the temple
complex with their sheep and oxen. He
also poured out the money changers'
coins and overturned the tables.
16 He told those who were selling
doves, "Get these things out of here!
Stop turning My Father's house into a
marketplace!"
17 And His disciples remembered that
it is wri en: Zeal for Your house will
consume Me.
18 So the Jews replied to Him, "What
sign of authority will You show us for
doing these things?"
19 Jesus answered, "Destroy this
sanctuary, and I will raise it up in three
days."JOHN 2 – 3
11
20 Therefore the Jews said, "This
sanctuary took 46 years to build, and will
You raise it up in three days?"
21 But He was speaking about the
sanctuary of His body.
22 So when He was raised from the
dead, His disciples remembered that
He had said this. And they believed the
Scripture and the statement Jesus had
made.
23 While He was in Jerusalem at the
Passover Fes val, many trusted in His
name when they saw the signs He was
doing.
24 Jesus, however, would not entrust
Himself to them, since He knew them all
25 and because He did not need anyone
to tes fy about man; for He Himself
knew what was in man.
1 There was a man from the
Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler
of the Jews.
3JOHN 3
12
2 This man came to Him at night and
said, "Rabbi, we know that You have
come from God as a teacher, for no one
could perform these signs You do unless
God were with him."
3 Jesus replied, "I assure you: Unless
someone is born again, he cannot see
the kingdom of God."
4 "But how can anyone be born when
he is old?" Nicodemus asked Him. "Can
he enter his mother's womb a second
me and be born?"
5 Jesus answered, "I assure you: Unless
someone is born of water and the Spirit,
he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
6 Whatever is born of the ﬂesh is ﬂesh,
and whatever is born of the Spirit is
spirit.
7 Do not be amazed that I told you that
you must be born again.
8 The wind blows where it pleases, and
you hear its sound, but you don't knowJOHN 3
13
where it comes from or where it is going.
So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
9 "How can these things be?" asked
Nicodemus.
10 "Are you a teacher of Israel and don't
know these things?" Jesus replied.
11 "I assure you: We speak what
We know and We tes fy to what We
have seen, but you do not accept Our
tes mony.
12 If I have told you about things that
happen on earth and you don't believe,
how will you believe if I tell you about
things of heaven?
13 No one has ascended into heaven
except the One who descended from
heaven--the Son of Man.
14 Just as Moses li ed up the snake in
the wilderness, so the Son of Man must
be li ed up,
15 so that everyone who believes in Him
will have eternal life.JOHN 3
14
16 "For God loved the world in this way:
He gave His One and Only Son, so that
everyone who believes in Him will not
perish but have eternal life.
17 For God did not send His Son into the
world that He might judge the world, but
that the world might be saved through
Him.
18 Anyone who believes in Him is
not judged, but anyone who does not
believe is already judged, because he
has not believed in the name of the One
and Only Son of God.
19 "This, then, is the judgment: the light
has come into the world, and people
loved darkness rather than the light
because their deeds were evil.
20 For everyone who prac ces wicked
things hates the light and avoids it, so
that his deeds may not be exposed.JOHN 3
15
21 But anyone who lives by the truth
comes to the light, so that his works may
be shown to be accomplished by God."
22 A er this, Jesus and His disciples
went to the Judean countryside, where
He spent me with them and bap zed.
23 John also was bap zing in Aenon
near Salim, because there was plenty of
water there. People were coming and
being bap zed,
24 since John had not yet been thrown
into prison.
25 Then a dispute arose between John's
disciples and a Jew about puriﬁca on.
26 So they came to John and told him,
"Rabbi, the One you tes ﬁed about, and
who was with you across the Jordan, is
bap zing--and everyone is ﬂocking to
Him."
27 John responded, "No one can receive
a single thing unless it's given to him
from heaven.JOHN 3
28 You yourselves can tes
16
fy that I said,
'I am not the Messiah, but I've been sent
ahead of Him.'
29 He who has the bride is the groom.
But the groom's friend, who stands by
and listens for him, rejoices greatly at
the groom's voice. So this joy of mine is
complete.
30 He must increase, but I must
decrease."
31 The One who comes from above is
above all. The one who is from the earth
is earthly and speaks in earthly terms.
The One who comes from heaven is
above all.
32 He tes ﬁes to what He has seen and
heard, yet no one accepts His tes mony.
33 The one who has accepted His
tes mony has aﬃrmed that God is true.
34 For God sent Him, and He speaks
God's words, since He gives the Spirit
without measure.JOHN 3 – 4
17
35 The Father loves the Son and has
given all things into His hands.
36 The one who believes in the Son has
eternal life, but the one who refuses
to believe in the Son will not see life;
instead, the wrath of God remains on
him.
1 When Jesus knew that the
Pharisees heard He was making and
bap zing more disciples than John
2 (though Jesus Himself was not
bap zing, but His disciples were),
3 He le Judea and went again to
Galilee.
4 He had to travel through Samaria,
5 so He came to a town of Samaria
called Sychar near the property that
Jacob had given his son Joseph.
6 Jacob's well was there, and Jesus,
worn out from His journey, sat down at
the well. It was about six in the evening.
4JOHN 4
18
7 A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. "Give Me a drink," Jesus said to
her,
8 for His disciples had gone into town to
buy food.
9 "How is it that You, a Jew, ask for a
drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"
she asked Him. For Jews do not associate
with Samaritans.
10 Jesus answered, "If you knew the gi
of God, and who is saying to you, 'Give
Me a drink,' you would ask Him, and He
would give you living water."
11 "Sir," said the woman, "You don't
even have a bucket, and the well is deep.
So where do you get this 'living water'?
12 You aren't greater than our father
Jacob, are you? He gave us the well and
drank from it himself, as did his sons and
livestock."
13 Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks
from this water will get thirsty again.JOHN 4
19
14 But whoever drinks from the water
that I will give him will never get thirsty
again--ever! In fact, the water I will
give him will become a well of water
springing up within him for eternal life."
15 "Sir," the woman said to Him, "give
me this water so I won't get thirsty and
come here to draw water."
16 "Go call your husband," He told her,
"and come back here."
17 "I don't have a husband," she
answered. "You have correctly said, 'I
don't have a husband,'" Jesus said.
18 "For you've had ﬁve husbands, and
the man you now have is not your
husband. What you have said is true."
19 "Sir," the woman replied, "I see that
You are a prophet.
20 Our fathers worshiped on this
mountain, yet you Jews say that the
place to worship is in Jerusalem."JOHN 4
20
21 Jesus told her, "Believe Me, woman,
an hour is coming when you will worship
the Father neither on this mountain nor
in Jerusalem.
22 You Samaritans worship what you do
not know. We worship what we do know,
because salva on is from the Jews.
23 But an hour is coming, and is now
here, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth.
Yes, the Father wants such people to
worship Him.
24 God is spirit, and those who worship
Him must worship in spirit and truth."
25 The woman said to Him, "I know
that Messiah is coming" (who is called
Christ). "When He comes, He will explain
everything to us."
26 "I am He ," Jesus told her, "the One
speaking to you."
27 Just then His disciples arrived, and
they were amazed that He was talkingJOHN 4
21
with a woman. Yet no one said, "What
do You want?" or "Why are You talking
with her?"
28 Then the woman le her water jar,
went into town, and told the men,
29 "Come, see a man who told me
everything I ever did! Could this be the
Messiah?"
30 They le the town and made their
way to Him.
31 In the mean me the disciples kept
urging Him, "Rabbi, eat something."
32 But He said, "I have food to eat that
you don't know about."
33 The disciples said to one another,
"Could someone have brought Him
something to eat?"
34 "My food is to do the will of Him who
sent Me and to ﬁnish His work," Jesus
told them.
35 "Don't you say, 'There are s ll four
more months, then comes the harvest'?JOHN 4
22
Listen to what I'm telling you: Open your
eyes and look at the ﬁelds, for they are
ready for harvest.
36 The reaper is already receiving pay
and gathering fruit for eternal life, so the
sower and reaper can rejoice together.
37 For in this case the saying is true:
'One sows and another reaps.'
38 I sent you to reap what you didn't
labor for; others have labored, and you
have beneﬁted from their labor."
39 Now many Samaritans from that
town believed in Him because of what
the woman said when she tes ﬁed, "He
told me everything I ever did."
40 Therefore, when the Samaritans
came to Him, they asked Him to stay
with them, and He stayed there two
days.
41 Many more believed because of what
He said.JOHN 4
23
42 And they told the woman, "We no
longer believe because of what you said,
for we have heard for ourselves and
know that this really is the Savior of the
world."
43 A er two days He le there for
Galilee.
44 Jesus Himself tes ﬁed that a prophet
has no honor in his own country.
45 When they entered Galilee, the
Galileans welcomed Him because they
had seen everything He did in Jerusalem
during the fes val. For they also had
gone to the fes val.
46 Then He went again to Cana of
Galilee, where He had turned the water
into wine. There was a certain royal
oﬃcial whose son was ill at Capernaum.
47 When this man heard that Jesus had
come from Judea into Galilee, he went
to Him and pleaded with Him to comeJOHN 4
24
down and heal his son, for he was about
to die.
48 Jesus told him, "Unless you people
see signs and wonders, you will not
believe."
49 "Sir," the oﬃcial said to Him, "come
down before my boy dies!"
50 "Go," Jesus told him, "your son will
live." The man believed what Jesus said
to him and departed.
51 While he was s ll going down, his
slaves met him saying that his boy was
alive.
52 He asked them at what me he
got be er. "Yesterday at seven in the
morning the fever le him," they
answered.
53 The father realized this was the very
hour at which Jesus had told him, "Your
son will live." Then he himself believed,
along with his whole household.JOHN 4 – 5
25
54 This therefore was the second sign
Jesus performed a er He came from
Judea to Galilee.
1 A er this, a Jewish fes val took
place, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
2 By the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there
is a pool, called Bethesda in Hebrew,
which has ﬁve colonnades.
3 Within these lay a mul tude of
the sick--blind, lame, and paralyzed
[--wai ng for the moving of the water,
4 because an angel would go down into
the pool from me to me and s r up
the water. Then the ﬁrst one who got in
a er the water was s rred up recovered
from whatever ailment he had].
5 One man was there who had been
sick for 38 years.
6 When Jesus saw him lying there and
knew he had already been there a long
5JOHN 5
26
me, He said to him, "Do you want to
get well?"
7 "Sir," the sick man answered, "I don't
have a man to put me into the pool
when the water is s rred up, but while
I'm coming, someone goes down ahead
of me."
8 "Get up," Jesus told him, "pick up your
bedroll and walk!"
9 Instantly the man got well, picked up
his bedroll, and started to walk. Now
that day was the Sabbath,
10 so the Jews said to the man who had
been healed, "This is the Sabbath! It's
illegal for you to pick up your bedroll."
11 He replied, "The man who made me
well told me, 'Pick up your bedroll and
walk.'"
12 "Who is this man who told you, 'Pick
up your bedroll and walk?'" they asked.
13 But the man who was cured did not
know who it was, because Jesus hadJOHN 5
27
slipped away into the crowd that was
there.
14 A er this, Jesus found him in the
temple complex and said to him, "See,
you are well. Do not sin any more, so
that something worse doesn't happen to
you."
15 The man went and reported to the
Jews that it was Jesus who had made
him well.
16 Therefore, the Jews began
persecu ng Jesus because He was doing
these things on the Sabbath.
17 But Jesus responded to them, "My
Father is s ll working, and I am working
also."
18 This is why the Jews began trying
all the more to kill Him: not only was
He breaking the Sabbath, but He was
even calling God His own Father, making
Himself equal with God.JOHN 5
28
19 Then Jesus replied, "I assure you: The
Son is not able to do anything on His
own, but only what He sees the Father
doing. For whatever the Father does, the
Son also does these things in the same
way.
20 For the Father loves the Son and
shows Him everything He is doing, and
He will show Him greater works than
these so that you will be amazed.
21 And just as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, so the Son also gives
life to anyone He wants to.
22 The Father, in fact, judges no one but
has given all judgment to the Son,
23 so that all people will honor the Son
just as they honor the Father. Anyone
who does not honor the Son does not
honor the Father who sent Him.
24 "I assure you: Anyone who hears My
word and believes Him who sent Me
has eternal life and will not come underJOHN 5
29
judgment but has passed from death to
life.
25 "I assure you: An hour is coming, and
is now here, when the dead will hear the
voice of the Son of God, and those who
hear will live.
26 For just as the Father has life in
Himself, so also He has granted to the
Son to have life in Himself.
27 And He has granted Him the right to
pass judgment, because He is the Son of
Man.
28 Do not be amazed at this, because a
me is coming when all who are in the
graves will hear His voice
29 and come out--those who have done
good things, to the resurrec on of life,
but those who have done wicked things,
to the resurrec on of judgment.
30 "I can do nothing on My own. I
judge only as I hear, and My judgment isJOHN 5
30
righteous, because I do not seek My own
will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
31 "If I tes fy about Myself, My
tes mony is not valid.
32 There is Another who tes ﬁes about
Me, and I know that the tes mony He
gives about Me is valid.
33 You have sent messengers to John,
and he has tes ﬁed to the truth.
34 I don't receive man's tes mony, but
I say these things so that you may be
saved.
35 John was a burning and shining lamp,
and for a me you were willing to enjoy
his light.
36 "But I have a greater tes mony than
John's because of the works that the
Father has given Me to accomplish.
These very works I am doing tes fy
about Me that the Father has sent Me.
37 The Father who sent Me has Himself
tes ﬁed about Me. You have not heardJOHN 5
31
His voice at any me, and you haven't
seen His form.
38 You don't have His word living in you,
because you don't believe the One He
sent.
39 You pore over the Scriptures because
you think you have eternal life in them,
yet they tes fy about Me.
40 And you are not willing to come to
Me that you may have life.
41 "I do not accept glory from men,
42 but I know you--that you have no
love for God within you.
43 I have come in My Father's name, yet
you don't accept Me. If someone else
comes in his own name, you will accept
him.
44 How can you believe? While
accep ng glory from one another, you
don't seek the glory that comes from the
only God.JOHN 5 – 6
32
45 Do not think that I will accuse you
to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on
whom you have set your hope.
46 For if you believed Moses, you would
believe Me, because he wrote about Me.
47 But if you don't believe his wri ngs,
how will you believe My words?"
1 A er this, Jesus crossed the Sea of
Galilee (or Tiberias).
2 And a huge crowd was following Him
because they saw the signs that He was
performing on the sick.
3 So Jesus went up a mountain and sat
down there with His disciples.
4 Now the Passover, a Jewish fes val,
was near.
5 Therefore, when Jesus looked up and
no ced a huge crowd coming toward
Him, He asked Philip, "Where will we
buy bread so these people can eat?"
6 He asked this to test him, for He
Himself knew what He was going to do.
6JOHN 6
33
7 Philip answered, "Two hundred
denarii worth of bread wouldn't be
enough for each of them to have a li le."
8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon
Peter's brother, said to Him,
9 "There's a boy here who has ﬁve
barley loaves and two ﬁsh--but what are
they for so many?"
10 Then Jesus said, "Have the people
sit down." There was plenty of grass in
that place, so they sat down. The men
numbered about 5,000.
11 Then Jesus took the loaves, and a er
giving thanks He distributed them to
those who were seated--so also with the
ﬁsh, as much as they wanted.
12 When they were full, He told His
disciples, "Collect the le overs so that
nothing is wasted."
13 So they collected them and ﬁlled
12 baskets with the pieces from theJOHN 6
34
ﬁve barley loaves that were le over by
those who had eaten.
14 When the people saw the sign He
had done, they said, "This really is the
Prophet who was to come into the
world!"
15 Therefore, when Jesus knew that
they were about to come and take Him
by force to make Him king, He withdrew
again to the mountain by Himself.
16 When evening came, His disciples
went down to the sea,
17 got into a boat, and started across
the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had
already set in, but Jesus had not yet
come to them.
18 Then a high wind arose, and the sea
began to churn.
19 A er they had rowed about three or
four miles, they saw Jesus walking on
the sea. He was coming near the boat,
and they were afraid.JOHN 6
35
20 But He said to them, "It is I. Don't be
afraid!"
21 Then they were willing to take Him
on board, and at once the boat was at
the shore where they were heading.
22 The next day, the crowd that had
stayed on the other side of the sea knew
there had been only one boat. They
also knew that Jesus had not boarded
the boat with His disciples, but that His
disciples had gone oﬀ alone.
23 Some boats from Tiberias came near
the place where they ate the bread a er
the Lord gave thanks.
24 When the crowd saw that neither
Jesus nor His disciples were there,
they got into the boats and went to
Capernaum looking for Jesus.
25 When they found Him on the other
side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi,
when did You get here?"JOHN 6
36
26 Jesus answered, "I assure you: You
are looking for Me, not because you saw
the signs, but because you ate the loaves
and were ﬁlled.
27 Don't work for the food that perishes
but for the food that lasts for eternal
life, which the Son of Man will give you,
because God the Father has set His seal
of approval on Him."
28 "What can we do to perform the
works of God?" they asked.
29 Jesus replied, "This is the work of
God: that you believe in the One He has
sent."
30 "What sign then are You going to do
so we may see and believe You?" they
asked. "What are You going to perform?
31 Our fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, just as it is wri en: He gave
them bread from heaven to eat. "
32 Jesus said to them, "I assure you:
Moses didn't give you the bread fromJOHN 6
37
heaven, but My Father gives you the real
bread from heaven.
33 For the bread of God is the One who
comes down from heaven and gives life
to the world."
34 Then they said, "Sir, give us this bread
always!"
35 "I am the bread of life," Jesus told
them. "No one who comes to Me will
ever be hungry, and no one who believes
in Me will ever be thirsty again.
36 But as I told you, you've seen Me,
and yet you do not believe.
37 Everyone the Father gives Me will
come to Me, and the one who comes to
Me I will never cast out.
38 For I have come down from heaven,
not to do My will, but the will of Him
who sent Me.
39 This is the will of Him who sent Me:
that I should lose none of those He hasJOHN 6
38
given Me but should raise them up on
the last day.
40 For this is the will of My Father: that
everyone who sees the Son and believes
in Him may have eternal life, and I will
raise him up on the last day."
41 Therefore the Jews started
complaining about Him, because He
said, "I am the bread that came down
from heaven."
42 They were saying, "Isn't this Jesus the
son of Joseph, whose father and mother
we know? How can He now say, 'I have
come down from heaven'?"
43 Jesus answered them, "Stop
complaining among yourselves.
44 No one can come to Me unless the
Father who sent Me draws him, and I
will raise him up on the last day.
45 It is wri en in the Prophets: And they
will all be taught by God. Everyone whoJOHN 6
39
has listened to and learned from the
Father comes to Me--
46 not that anyone has seen the Father
except the One who is from God. He has
seen the Father.
47 "I assure you: Anyone who believes
has eternal life.
48 I am the bread of life.
49 Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died.
50 This is the bread that comes down
from heaven so that anyone may eat of
it and not die.
51 I am the living bread that came down
from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread
he will live forever. The bread that I will
give for the life of the world is My ﬂesh."
52 At that, the Jews argued among
themselves, "How can this man give us
His ﬂesh to eat?"
53 So Jesus said to them, "I assure you:
Unless you eat the ﬂesh of the Son ofJOHN 6
40
Man and drink His blood, you do not
have life in yourselves.
54 Anyone who eats My ﬂesh and drinks
My blood has eternal life, and I will raise
him up on the last day,
55 because My ﬂesh is real food and My
blood is real drink.
56 The one who eats My ﬂesh and drinks
My blood lives in Me, and I in him.
57 Just as the living Father sent Me and
I live because of the Father, so the one
who feeds on Me will live because of
Me.
58 This is the bread that came down
from heaven; it is not like the manna
your fathers ate--and they died. The one
who eats this bread will live forever."
59 He said these things while teaching
in the synagogue in Capernaum.
60 Therefore, when many of His
disciples heard this, they said, "This
teaching is hard! Who can accept it?"JOHN 6
41
61 Jesus, knowing in Himself that His
disciples were complaining about this,
asked them, "Does this oﬀend you?
62 Then what if you were to observe the
Son of Man ascending to where He was
before?
63 The Spirit is the One who gives life.
The ﬂesh doesn't help at all. The words
that I have spoken to you are spirit and
are life.
64 But there are some among you who
don't believe." (For Jesus knew from the
beginning those who would not believe
and the one who would betray Him.)
65 He said, "This is why I told you that
no one can come to Me unless it is
granted to him by the Father."
66 From that moment many of His
disciples turned back and no longer
accompanied Him.JOHN 6 – 7
42
67 Therefore Jesus said to the Twelve,
"You don't want to go away too, do
you?"
68 Simon Peter answered, "Lord, who
will we go to? You have the words of
eternal life.
69 We have come to believe and know
that You are the Holy One of God!"
70 Jesus replied to them, "Didn't I
choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you
is the Devil!"
71 He was referring to Judas, Simon
Iscariot's son, one of the Twelve,
because he was going to betray Him.
1 A er this, Jesus traveled in Galilee,
since He did not want to travel in
Judea because the Jews were trying to
kill Him.
2 The Jewish Fes val of Tabernacles was
near,
7JOHN 7
43
3 so His brothers said to Him, "Leave
here and go to Judea so Your disciples
can see Your works that You are doing.
4 For no one does anything in secret
while he's seeking public recogni on. If
You do these things, show Yourself to
the world."
5 (For not even His brothers believed in
Him.)
6 Jesus told them, "My me has not yet
arrived, but your me is always at hand.
7 The world cannot hate you, but it does
hate Me because I tes fy about it--that
its deeds are evil.
8 Go up to the fes val yourselves. I'm
not going up to the fes val yet, because
My me has not yet fully come."
9 A er He had said these things, He
stayed in Galilee.
10 A er His brothers had gone up to
the fes val, then He also went up, not
openly but secretly.JOHN 7
44
11 The Jews were looking for Him at the
fes val and saying, "Where is He?"
12 And there was a lot of discussion
about Him among the crowds. Some
were saying, "He's a good man." Others
were saying, "No, on the contrary, He's
deceiving the people."
13 S ll, nobody was talking publicly
about Him because they feared the Jews.
14 When the fes val was already half
over, Jesus went up into the temple
complex and began to teach.
15 Then the Jews were amazed and
said, "How does He know the Scriptures,
since He hasn't been trained?"
16 Jesus answered them, "My teaching
isn't Mine but is from the One who sent
Me.
17 If anyone wants to do His will, he
will understand whether the teaching is
from God or if I am speaking on My own.JOHN 7
45
18 The one who speaks for himself seeks
his own glory. But He who seeks the
glory of the One who sent Him is true,
and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
19 Didn't Moses give you the law? Yet
none of you keeps the law! Why do you
want to kill Me?"
20 "You have a demon!" the crowd
responded. "Who wants to kill You?"
21 "I did one work, and you are all
amazed," Jesus answered.
22 "Consider this: Moses has given you
circumcision--not that it comes from
Moses but from the fathers--and you
circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
23 If a man receives circumcision on
the Sabbath so that the law of Moses
won't be broken, are you angry at Me
because I made a man en rely well on
the Sabbath?JOHN 7
46
24 Stop judging according to outward
appearances; rather judge according to
righteous judgment."
25 Some of the people of Jerusalem
were saying, "Isn't this the man they
want to kill?
26 Yet, look! He's speaking publicly and
they're saying nothing to Him. Can it be
true that the authori es know He is the
Messiah?
27 But we know where this man is from.
When the Messiah comes, nobody will
know where He is from."
28 As He was teaching in the temple
complex, Jesus cried out, "You know Me
and you know where I am from. Yet I
have not come on My own, but the One
who sent Me is true. You don't know
Him;
29 I know Him because I am from Him,
and He sent Me."JOHN 7
47
30 Then they tried to seize Him. Yet no
one laid a hand on Him because His hour
had not yet come.
31 However, many from the crowd
believed in Him and said, "When the
Messiah comes, He won't perform more
signs than this man has done, will He?"
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd
mu ering these things about Him, so
the chief priests and the Pharisees sent
temple police to arrest Him.
33 Then Jesus said, "I am only with you
for a short me. Then I'm going to the
One who sent Me.
34 You will look for Me, but you will not
ﬁnd Me; and where I am, you cannot
come."
35 Then the Jews said to one another,
"Where does He intend to go so we
won't ﬁnd Him? He doesn't intend to go
to the Dispersion among the Greeks and
teach the Greeks, does He?JOHN 7
48
36 What is this remark He made: 'You
will look for Me, and you will not ﬁnd
Me; and where I am, you cannot come'?"
37 On the last and most important day
of the fes val, Jesus stood up and cried
out, "If anyone is thirsty, he should come
to Me and drink!
38 The one who believes in Me, as the
Scripture has said, will have streams of
living water ﬂow from deep within him."
39 He said this about the Spirit, whom
those who believed in Him were going to
receive, for the Spirit had not yet been
received, because Jesus had not yet
been gloriﬁed.
40 When some from the crowd heard
these words, they said, "This really is the
Prophet!"
41 Others said, "This is the Messiah!"
But some said, "Surely the Messiah
doesn't come from Galilee, does He?JOHN 7
49
42 Doesn't the Scripture say that the
Messiah comes from David's oﬀspring
and from the town of Bethlehem, where
David once lived?"
43 So a division occurred among the
crowd because of Him.
44 Some of them wanted to seize Him,
but no one laid hands on Him.
45 Then the temple police came to the
chief priests and Pharisees, who asked
them, "Why haven't you brought Him?"
46 The police answered, "No man ever
spoke like this!"
47 Then the Pharisees responded to
them: "Are you fooled too?
48 Have any of the rulers believed in
Him? Or any of the Pharisees?
49 But this crowd, which doesn't know
the law, is accursed!"
50 Nicodemus--the one who came to
Him previously, being one of them--said
to them,JOHN 7 – 8
50
51 "Our law doesn't judge a man before
it hears from him and knows what he's
doing, does it?"
52 "You aren't from Galilee too, are
you?" they replied. "Inves gate and you
will see that no prophet arises from
Galilee."
53 [So each one went to his house.
1 But Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives.
2 At dawn He went to the temple
complex again, and all the people were
coming to Him. He sat down and began
to teach them.
3 Then the scribes and the Pharisees
brought a woman caught in adultery,
making her stand in the center.
4 "Teacher," they said to Him, "this
woman was caught in the act of
commi ng adultery.
8JOHN 8
51
5 In the law Moses commanded us to
stone such women. So what do You
say?"
6 They asked this to trap Him, in order
that they might have evidence to accuse
Him. Jesus stooped down and started
wri ng on the ground with His ﬁnger.
7 When they persisted in ques oning
Him, He stood up and said to them, "The
one without sin among you should be
the ﬁrst to throw a stone at her."
8 Then He stooped down again and
con nued wri ng on the ground.
9 When they heard this, they le one
by one, star ng with the older men.
Only He was le , with the woman in the
center.
10 When Jesus stood up, He said to her,
"Woman, where are they? Has no one
condemned you?"
11 "No one, Lord," she answered.
"Neither do I condemn you," said Jesus.JOHN 8
52
"Go, and from now on do not sin any
more."]
12 Then Jesus spoke to them again:
"I am the light of the world. Anyone
who follows Me will never walk in the
darkness but will have the light of life."
13 So the Pharisees said to Him, "You are
tes fying about Yourself. Your tes mony
is not valid."
14 "Even if I tes fy about Myself," Jesus
replied, "My tes mony is valid, because I
know where I came from and where I'm
going. But you don't know where I come
from or where I'm going.
15 You judge by human standards. I
judge no one.
16 And if I do judge, My judgment is
true, because I am not alone, but I and
the Father who sent Me judge together .
17 Even in your law it is wri en that the
witness of two men is valid.JOHN 8
18 I am the One who tes
53
ﬁes about
Myself, and the Father who sent Me
tes ﬁes about Me."
19 Then they asked Him, "Where is Your
Father?" "You know neither Me nor My
Father," Jesus answered. "If you knew
Me, you would also know My Father."
20 He spoke these words by the
treasury, while teaching in the temple
complex. But no one seized Him, because
His hour had not come.
21 Then He said to them again, "I'm
going away; you will look for Me, and
you will die in your sin. Where I'm going,
you cannot come."
22 So the Jews said again, "He won't kill
Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where
I'm going, you cannot come'?"
23 "You are from below," He told them,
"I am from above. You are of this world;
I am not of this world.JOHN 8
54
24 Therefore I told you that you will die
in your sins. For if you do not believe
that I am He , you will die in your sins."
25 "Who are You?" they ques oned.
"Precisely what I've been telling you
from the very beginning," Jesus told
them.
26 "I have many things to say and to
judge about you, but the One who sent
Me is true, and what I have heard from
Him--these things I tell the world."
27 They did not know He was speaking
to them about the Father.
28 So Jesus said to them, "When you li
up the Son of Man, then you will know
that I am He , and that I do nothing on
My own. But just as the Father taught
Me, I say these things.
29 The One who sent Me is with Me. He
has not le Me alone, because I always
do what pleases Him."JOHN 8
55
30 As He was saying these things, many
believed in Him.
31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had
believed Him, "If you con nue in My
word, you really are My disciples.
32 You will know the truth, and the truth
will set you free."
33 "We are descendants of Abraham,"
they answered Him, "and we have never
been enslaved to anyone. How can You
say, 'You will become free'?"
34 Jesus responded, "I assure you:
Everyone who commits sin is a slave of
sin.
35 A slave does not remain in the
household forever, but a son does
remain forever.
36 Therefore if the Son sets you free,
you really will be free.
37 I know you are descendants of
Abraham, but you are trying to kill MeJOHN 8
56
because My word is not welcome among
you.
38 I speak what I have seen in the
presence of the Father, and therefore
you do what you have heard from your
father."
39 "Our father is Abraham!" they
replied. "If you were Abraham's
children," Jesus told them, "you would
do what Abraham did.
40 But now you are trying to kill Me, a
man who has told you the truth that I
heard from God. Abraham did not do
this!
41 You're doing what your father does."
"We weren't born of sexual immorality,"
they said. "We have one Father--God."
42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your
Father, you would love Me, because I
came from God and I am here. For I
didn't come on My own, but He sent Me.JOHN 8
57
43 Why don't you understand what I
say? Because you cannot listen to My
word.
44 You are of your father the Devil,
and you want to carry out your father's
desires. He was a murderer from the
beginning and has not stood in the
truth, because there is no truth in him.
When he tells a lie, he speaks from his
own nature, because he is a liar and the
father of liars.
45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do
not believe Me.
46 Who among you can convict Me of
sin? If I tell the truth, why don't you
believe Me?
47 The one who is from God listens to
God's words. This is why you don't listen,
because you are not from God."
48 The Jews responded to Him, "Aren't
we right in saying that You're a Samaritan
and have a demon?"JOHN 8
58
49 "I do not have a demon," Jesus
answered. "On the contrary, I honor My
Father and you dishonor Me.
50 I do not seek My glory; the One who
seeks it also judges.
51 I assure you: If anyone keeps My
word, he will never see death--ever!"
52 Then the Jews said, "Now we know
You have a demon. Abraham died and
so did the prophets. You say, 'If anyone
keeps My word, he will never taste
death--ever!'
53 Are You greater than our father
Abraham who died? Even the prophets
died. Who do You pretend to be?"
54 "If I glorify Myself," Jesus answered,
"My glory is nothing. My Father--you say
about Him, 'He is our God.'--He is the
One who gloriﬁes Me.
55 You've never known Him, but I know
Him. If I were to say I don't know Him, IJOHN 8 – 9
59
would be a liar like you. But I do know
Him, and I keep His word.
56 Your father Abraham was overjoyed
that he would see My day; he saw it and
rejoiced."
57 The Jews replied, "You aren't 50 years
old yet, and You've seen Abraham?"
58 Jesus said to them, "I assure you:
Before Abraham was, I am."
59 At that, they picked up stones to
throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and
went out of the temple complex.
1 As He was passing by, He saw a
man blind from birth.
2 His disciples ques oned Him: "Rabbi,
who sinned, this man or his parents, that
he was born blind?"
3 "Neither this man nor his parents
sinned," Jesus answered. "This came
about so that God's works might be
displayed in him.
9JOHN 9
60
4 We must do the works of Him who
sent Me while it is day. Night is coming
when no one can work.
5 As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world."
6 A er He said these things He spit on
the ground, made some mud from the
saliva, and spread the mud on his eyes.
7 "Go," He told him, "wash in the pool
of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he
le , washed, and came back seeing.
8 His neighbors and those who formerly
had seen him as a beggar said, "Isn't this
the man who sat begging?"
9 Some said, "He's the one." "No,"
others were saying, "but he looks like
him." He kept saying, "I'm the one!"
10 Therefore they asked him, "Then how
were your eyes opened?"
11 He answered, "The man called Jesus
made mud, spread it on my eyes, and
told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' SoJOHN 9
61
when I went and washed I received my
sight."
12 "Where is He?" they asked. "I don't
know," he said.
13 They brought the man who used to
be blind to the Pharisees.
14 The day that Jesus made the mud
and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.
15 So again the Pharisees asked him
how he received his sight. "He put mud
on my eyes," he told them. "I washed
and I can see."
16 Therefore some of the Pharisees
said, "This man is not from God, for He
doesn't keep the Sabbath!" But others
were saying, "How can a sinful man
perform such signs?" And there was a
division among them.
17 Again they asked the blind man,
"What do you say about Him, since He
opened your eyes?" "He's a prophet," he
said.JOHN 9
62
18 The Jews did not believe this about
him--that he was blind and received
sight--un l they summoned the parents
of the one who had received his sight.
19 They asked them, "Is this your son,
the one you say was born blind? How
then does he now see?"
20 "We know this is our son and that he
was born blind," his parents answered.
21 "But we don't know how he now
sees, and we don't know who opened
his eyes. Ask him; he's of age. He will
speak for himself."
22 His parents said these things because
they were afraid of the Jews, since the
Jews had already agreed that if anyone
confessed Him as Messiah, he would be
banned from the synagogue.
23 This is why his parents said, "He's of
age; ask him."
24 So a second me they summoned
the man who had been blind and toldJOHN 9
63
him, "Give glory to God. We know that
this man is a sinner!"
25 He answered, "Whether or not He's
a sinner, I don't know. One thing I do
know: I was blind, and now I can see!"
26 Then they asked him, "What did He
do to you? How did He open your eyes?"
27 "I already told you," he said, "and
you didn't listen. Why do you want to
hear it again? You don't want to become
His disciples too, do you?"
28 They ridiculed him: "You're that
man's disciple, but we're Moses'
disciples.
29 We know that God has spoken to
Moses. But this man--we don't know
where He's from!"
30 "This is an amazing thing," the man
told them. "You don't know where He is
from, yet He opened my eyes!JOHN 9
64
31 We know that God doesn't listen to
sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and
does His will, He listens to him.
32 Throughout history no one has ever
heard of someone opening the eyes of a
person born blind.
33 If this man were not from God, He
wouldn't be able to do anything."
34 "You were born en rely in sin," they
replied, "and are you trying to teach us?"
Then they threw him out.
35 When Jesus heard that they had
thrown the man out, He found him and
asked, "Do you believe in the Son of
Man?"
36 "Who is He, Sir, that I may believe in
Him?" he asked.
37 Jesus answered, "You have seen Him;
in fact, He is the One speaking with you."
38 "I believe, Lord!" he said, and he
worshiped Him.JOHN 9 – 10
65
39 Jesus said, "I came into this world for
judgment, in order that those who do
not see will see and those who do see
will become blind."
40 Some of the Pharisees who were
with Him heard these things and asked
Him, "We aren't blind too, are we?"
41 "If you were blind," Jesus told them,
"you wouldn't have sin. But now that
you say, 'We see'--your sin remains.
1 "I assure you: Anyone who
doesn't enter the sheep pen by
the door but climbs in some other way,
is a thief and a robber.
2 The one who enters by the door is the
shepherd of the sheep.
3 The doorkeeper opens it for him, and
the sheep hear his voice. He calls his
own sheep by name and leads them out.
4 When he has brought all his own
outside, he goes ahead of them. The
10JOHN 10
66
sheep follow him because they recognize
his voice.
5 They will never follow a stranger;
instead they will run away from him,
because they don't recognize the voice
of strangers."
6 Jesus gave them this illustra on, but
they did not understand what He was
telling them.
7 So Jesus said again, "I assure you: I am
the door of the sheep.
8 All who came before Me are thieves
and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen
to them.
9 I am the door. If anyone enters by Me,
he will be saved and will come in and go
out and ﬁnd pasture.
10 A thief comes only to steal and to kill
and to destroy. I have come that they
may have life and have it in abundance.JOHN 10
67
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep.
12 The hired man, since he is not the
shepherd and doesn't own the sheep,
leaves them and runs away when he sees
a wolf coming. The wolf then snatches
and sca ers them.
13 This happens because he is a hired
man and doesn't care about the sheep.
14 "I am the good shepherd. I know My
own sheep, and they know Me,
15 as the Father knows Me, and I know
the Father. I lay down My life for the
sheep.
16 But I have other sheep that are not
of this fold; I must bring them also, and
they will listen to My voice. Then there
will be one ﬂock, one shepherd.
17 This is why the Father loves Me,
because I am laying down My life so I
may take it up again.JOHN 10
68
18 No one takes it from Me, but I lay it
down on My own. I have the right to lay
it down, and I have the right to take it
up again. I have received this command
from My Father."
19 Again a division took place among
the Jews because of these words.
20 Many of them were saying, "He has
a demon and He's crazy! Why do you
listen to Him?"
21 Others were saying, "These aren't the
words of someone demon-possessed.
Can a demon open the eyes of the
blind?"
22 Then the Fes val of Dedica on took
place in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
23 Jesus was walking in the temple
complex in Solomon's Colonnade.
24 Then the Jews surrounded Him and
asked, "How long are You going to keep
us in suspense? If You are the Messiah,
tell us plainly."JOHN 10
69
25 "I did tell you and you don't believe,"
Jesus answered them. "The works that
I do in My Father's name tes fy about
Me.
26 But you don't believe because you
are not My sheep.
27 My sheep hear My voice, I know
them, and they follow Me.
28 I give them eternal life, and they will
never perish--ever! No one will snatch
them out of My hand.
29 My Father, who has given them to
Me, is greater than all. No one is able to
snatch them out of the Father's hand.
30 The Father and I are one."
31 Again the Jews picked up rocks to
stone Him.
32 Jesus replied, "I have shown you
many good works from the Father.
Which of these works are you stoning
Me for?"JOHN 10
70
33 "We aren't stoning You for a good
work," the Jews answered, "but for
blasphemy, because You--being a
man--make Yourself God."
34 Jesus answered them, "Isn't it wri en
in your law, I said, you are gods ?
35 If He called those whom the word of
God came to 'gods'--and the Scripture
cannot be broken--
36 do you say, 'You are blaspheming' to
the One the Father set apart and sent
into the world, because I said: I am the
Son of God?
37 If I am not doing My Father's works,
don't believe Me.
38 But if I am doing them and you don't
believe Me, believe the works. This way
you will know and understand that the
Father is in Me and I in the Father."
39 Then they were trying again to seize
Him, yet He eluded their grasp.JOHN 10 – 11
71
40 So He departed again across the
Jordan to the place where John had
been bap zing earlier, and He remained
there.
41 Many came to Him and said, "John
never did a sign, but everything John
said about this man was true."
42 And many believed in Him there.
1 Now a man was sick, Lazarus,
from Bethany, the village of Mary
and her sister Martha.
2 Mary was the one who anointed the
Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet
with her hair, and it was her brother
Lazarus who was sick.
3 So the sisters sent a message to Him:
"Lord, the one You love is sick."
4 When Jesus heard it, He said, "This
sickness will not end in death but is for
the glory of God, so that the Son of God
may be gloriﬁed through it."
11JOHN 11
72
5 (Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and
Lazarus.)
6 So when He heard that he was sick,
He stayed two more days in the place
where He was.
7 Then a er that, He said to the
disciples, "Let's go to Judea again."
8 "Rabbi," the disciples told Him, "just
now the Jews tried to stone You, and
You're going there again?"
9 "Aren't there 12 hours in a day?" Jesus
answered. "If anyone walks during the
day, he doesn't stumble, because he
sees the light of this world.
10 If anyone walks during the night, he
does stumble, because the light is not in
him."
11 He said this, and then He told them,
"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
but I'm on My way to wake him up."
12 Then the disciples said to Him, "Lord,
if he has fallen asleep, he will get well."JOHN 11
73
13 Jesus, however, was speaking about
his death, but they thought He was
speaking about natural sleep.
14 So Jesus then told them plainly,
"Lazarus has died.
15 I'm glad for you that I wasn't there
so that you may believe. But let's go to
him."
16 Then Thomas (called "Twin") said to
his fellow disciples, "Let's go so that we
may die with Him."
17 When Jesus arrived, He found that
Lazarus had already been in the tomb
four days.
18 Bethany was near Jerusalem (about
two miles away).
19 Many of the Jews had come to
Martha and Mary to comfort them about
their brother.
20 As soon as Martha heard that Jesus
was coming, she went to meet Him. But
Mary remained seated in the house.JOHN 11
74
21 Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if
You had been here, my brother wouldn't
have died.
22 Yet even now I know that whatever
You ask from God, God will give You."
23 "Your brother will rise again," Jesus
told her.
24 Martha said, "I know that he will rise
again in the resurrec on at the last day."
25 Jesus said to her, "I am the
resurrec on and the life. The one who
believes in Me, even if he dies, will live.
26 Everyone who lives and believes in
Me will never die--ever. Do you believe
this?"
27 "Yes, Lord," she told Him, "I believe
You are the Messiah, the Son of God,
who was to come into the world."
28 Having said this, she went back and
called her sister Mary, saying in private,
"The Teacher is here and is calling for
you."JOHN 11
75
29 As soon as she heard this, she got up
quickly and went to Him.
30 Jesus had not yet come into the
village but was s ll in the place where
Martha had met Him.
31 The Jews who were with her in the
house consoling her saw that Mary
got up quickly and went out. So they
followed her, supposing that she was
going to the tomb to cry there.
32 When Mary came to where Jesus
was and saw Him, she fell at His feet and
told Him, "Lord, if You had been here,
my brother would not have died!"
33 When Jesus saw her crying, and the
Jews who had come with her crying,
He was angry in His spirit and deeply
moved.
34 "Where have you put him?" He
asked. "Lord," they told Him, "come and
see."
35 Jesus wept.JOHN 11
76
36 So the Jews said, "See how He loved
him!"
37 But some of them said, "Couldn't He
who opened the blind man's eyes also
have kept this man from dying?"
38 Then Jesus, angry in Himself again,
came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a
stone was lying against it.
39 "Remove the stone," Jesus said.
Martha, the dead man's sister, told Him,
"Lord, he already s nks. It's been four
days."
40 Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you
that if you believed you would see the
glory of God?"
41 So they removed the stone. Then
Jesus raised His eyes and said, "Father, I
thank You that You heard Me.
42 I know that You always hear Me, but
because of the crowd standing here I
said this, so they may believe You sent
Me."JOHN 11
43 A
77
er He said this, He shouted with a
loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
44 The dead man came out bound hand
and foot with linen strips and with his
face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to
them, "Loose him and let him go."
45 Therefore many of the Jews who
came to Mary and saw what He did
believed in Him.
46 But some of them went to the
Pharisees and told them what Jesus had
done.
47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees
convened the Sanhedrin and said, "What
are we going to do since this man does
many signs?
48 If we let Him con nue in this way,
everybody will believe in Him! Then the
Romans will come and remove both our
place and our na on."JOHN 11
78
49 One of them, Caiaphas, who was high
priest that year, said to them, "You know
nothing at all!
50 You're not considering that it is to
your advantage that one man should die
for the people rather than the whole
na on perish."
51 He did not say this on his own,
but being high priest that year he
prophesied that Jesus was going to die
for the na on,
52 and not for the na on only, but also
to unite the sca ered children of God.
53 So from that day on they plo ed to
kill Him.
54 Therefore Jesus no longer walked
openly among the Jews but departed
from there to the countryside near the
wilderness, to a town called Ephraim.
And He stayed there with the disciples.
55 The Jewish Passover was near, and
many went up to Jerusalem from theJOHN 11 – 12
79
country to purify themselves before the
Passover.
56 They were looking for Jesus and
asking one another as they stood in the
temple complex: "What do you think?
He won't come to the fes val, will He?"
57 The chief priests and the Pharisees
had given orders that if anyone knew
where He was, he should report it so
they could arrest Him.
1 Six days before the Passover,
Jesus came to Bethany where
Lazarus was, the one Jesus had raised
from the dead.
2 So they gave a dinner for Him there;
Martha was serving them, and Lazarus
was one of those reclining at the table
with Him.
3 Then Mary took a pound of fragrant
oil--pure and expensive nard--anointed
Jesus' feet, and wiped His feet with her
12JOHN 12
80
hair. So the house was ﬁlled with the
fragrance of the oil.
4 Then one of His disciples, Judas
Iscariot (who was about to betray Him),
said,
5 "Why wasn't this fragrant oil sold for
300 denarii and given to the poor?"
6 He didn't say this because he cared
about the poor but because he was a
thief. He was in charge of the money-bag
and would steal part of what was put in
it.
7 Jesus answered, "Leave her alone; she
has kept it for the day of My burial.
8 For you always have the poor with
you, but you do not always have Me."
9 Then a large crowd of the Jews
learned He was there. They came not
only because of Jesus, but also to see
Lazarus the one He had raised from the
dead.JOHN 12
81
10 Therefore the chief priests decided
to also kill Lazarus,
11 because he was the reason many
of the Jews were deser ng them and
believing in Jesus.
12 The next day, when the large crowd
that had come to the fes val heard that
Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
13 they took palm branches and went
out to meet Him. They kept shou ng:
"Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes
in the name of the Lord --the King of
Israel!"
14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat
on it, just as it is wri en:
15 Fear no more, Daughter Zion; look!
your King is coming, si ng on a donkey's
colt.
16 His disciples did not understand these
things at ﬁrst. However, when Jesus was
gloriﬁed, then they remembered that
these things had been wri en aboutJOHN 12
82
Him and that they had done these things
to Him.
17 Meanwhile the crowd, which had
been with Him when He called Lazarus
out of the tomb and raised him from the
dead, con nued to tes fy.
18 This is also why the crowd met Him,
because they heard He had done this
sign.
19 Then the Pharisees said to one
another, "You see? You've accomplished
nothing. Look--the world has gone a er
Him!"
20 Now some Greeks were among those
who went up to worship at the fes val.
21 So they came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of
him, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
22 Philip went and told Andrew; then
Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
23 Jesus replied to them, "The hour has
come for the Son of Man to be gloriﬁed.JOHN 12
83
24 "I assure you: Unless a grain of wheat
falls into the ground and dies, it remains
by itself. But if it dies, it produces a large
crop.
25 The one who loves his life will lose
it, and the one who hates his life in this
world will keep it for eternal life.
26 If anyone serves Me, he must follow
Me. Where I am, there My servant also
will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father
will honor him.
27 "Now My soul is troubled. What
should I say--Father, save Me from this
hour? But that is why I came to this hour.
28 Father, glorify Your name!" Then
a voice came from heaven: "I have
gloriﬁed it, and I will glorify it again!"
29 The crowd standing there heard it
and said it was thunder. Others said, "An
angel has spoken to Him!"
30 Jesus responded, "This voice came,
not for Me, but for you.JOHN 12
84
31 Now is the judgment of this world.
Now the ruler of this world will be cast
out.
32 As for Me, if I am li ed up from the
earth I will draw all people to Myself."
33 He said this to signify what kind of
death He was about to die.
34 Then the crowd replied to Him,
"We have heard from the law that the
Messiah will remain forever. So how can
You say, 'The Son of Man must be li ed
up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
35 Jesus answered, "The light will be
with you only a li le longer. Walk while
you have the light so that darkness
doesn't overtake you. The one who
walks in darkness doesn't know where
he's going.
36 While you have the light, believe in
the light so that you may become sons
of light." Jesus said this, then went away
and hid from them.JOHN 12
85
37 Even though He had performed so
many signs in their presence, they did
not believe in Him.
38 But this was to fulﬁll the word of
Isaiah the prophet, who said: Lord, who
has believed our message? And who has
the arm of the Lord been revealed to?
39 This is why they were unable to
believe, because Isaiah also said:
40 He has blinded their eyes and
hardened their hearts, so that they
would not see with their eyes or
understand with their hearts, and be
converted, and I would heal them.
41 Isaiah said these things because he
saw His glory and spoke about Him.
42 Nevertheless, many did believe in
Him even among the rulers, but because
of the Pharisees they did not confess
Him, so they would not be banned from
the synagogue.JOHN 12
86
43 For they loved praise from men more
than praise from God.
44 Then Jesus cried out, "The one who
believes in Me believes not in Me, but in
Him who sent Me.
45 And the one who sees Me sees Him
who sent Me.
46 I have come as a light into the world,
so that everyone who believes in Me
would not remain in darkness.
47 If anyone hears My words and
doesn't keep them, I do not judge him;
for I did not come to judge the world but
to save the world.
48 The one who rejects Me and doesn't
accept My sayings has this as his judge:
the word I have spoken will judge him on
the last day.
49 For I have not spoken on My own,
but the Father Himself who sent Me has
given Me a command as to what I should
say and what I should speak.JOHN 12 – 13
87
50 I know that His command is eternal
life. So the things that I speak, I speak
just as the Father has told Me."
1 Before the Passover Fes val,
Jesus knew that His hour had
come to depart from this world to the
Father. Having loved His own who were
in the world, He loved them to the end.
2 Now by the me of supper, the Devil
had already put it into the heart of Judas,
Simon Iscariot's son, to betray Him.
3 Jesus knew that the Father had given
everything into His hands, that He had
come from God, and that He was going
back to God.
4 So He got up from supper, laid aside
His robe, took a towel, and ed it around
Himself.
5 Next, He poured water into a basin
and began to wash His disciples' feet and
to dry them with the towel ed around
Him.
13JOHN 13
88
6 He came to Simon Peter, who asked
Him, "Lord, are You going to wash my
feet?"
7 Jesus answered him, "What I'm
doing you don't understand now, but
a erwards you will know."
8 "You will never wash my feet--ever!"
Peter said. Jesus replied, "If I don't wash
you, you have no part with Me."
9 Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, not
only my feet, but also my hands and my
head."
10 "One who has bathed," Jesus told
him, "doesn't need to wash anything
except his feet, but he is completely
clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
11 For He knew who would betray Him.
This is why He said, "You are not all
clean."
12 When Jesus had washed their feet
and put on His robe, He reclined againJOHN 13
89
and said to them, "Do you know what I
have done for you?
13 You call Me Teacher and Lord. This is
well said, for I am.
14 So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have
washed your feet, you also ought to
wash one another's feet.
15 For I have given you an example that
you also should do just as I have done
for you.
16 "I assure you: A slave is not greater
than his master, and a messenger is not
greater than the one who sent him.
17 If you know these things, you are
blessed if you do them.
18 I'm not speaking about all of you;
I know those I have chosen. But the
Scripture must be fulﬁlled: The one who
eats My bread has raised his heel against
Me.JOHN 13
90
19 "I am telling you now before it
happens, so that when it does happen
you will believe that I am He .
20 I assure you: The one who receives
whomever I send receives Me, and the
one who receives Me receives Him who
sent Me."
21 When Jesus had said this, He was
troubled in His spirit and tes ﬁed, "I
assure you: One of you will betray Me!"
22 The disciples started looking at one
another--uncertain which one He was
speaking about.
23 One of His disciples, the one Jesus
loved, was reclining close beside Jesus.
24 Simon Peter mo oned to him to ﬁnd
out who it was He was talking about.
25 So he leaned back against Jesus and
asked Him, "Lord, who is it?"
26 Jesus replied, "He's the one I give the
piece of bread to a er I have dipped it."JOHN 13
91
When He had dipped the bread, He gave
it to Judas, Simon Iscariot's son.
27 A er Judas ate the piece of bread,
Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus told
him, "What you're doing, do quickly."
28 None of those reclining at the table
knew why He told him this.
29 Since Judas kept the money-bag,
some thought that Jesus was telling him,
"Buy what we need for the fes val," or
that he should give something to the
poor.
30 A er receiving the piece of bread, he
went out immediately. And it was night.
31 When he had gone out, Jesus said,
"Now the Son of Man is gloriﬁed, and
God is gloriﬁed in Him.
32 If God is gloriﬁed in Him, God will also
glorify Him in Himself and will glorify
Him at once.
33 "Children, I am with you a li le while
longer. You will look for Me, and just asJOHN 13 – 14
92
I told the Jews, 'Where I am going you
cannot come,' so now I tell you.
34 "I give you a new commandment:
love one another. Just as I have loved
you, you must also love one another.
35 By this all people will know that you
are My disciples, if you have love for one
another."
36 "Lord," Simon Peter said to Him,
"where are You going?" Jesus answered,
"Where I am going you cannot follow
Me now, but you will follow later."
37 "Lord," Peter asked, "why can't I
follow You now? I will lay down my life
for You!"
38 Jesus replied, "Will you lay down
your life for Me? I assure you: A rooster
will not crow un l you have denied Me
three mes.
1 "Your heart must not be
troubled. Believe in God; believe
also in Me.
14JOHN 14
93
2 In My Father's house are many
dwelling places; if not, I would have told
you. I am going away to prepare a place
for you.
3 If I go away and prepare a place for
you, I will come back and receive you to
Myself, so that where I am you may be
also.
4 You know the way where I am going."
5 "Lord," Thomas said, "we don't know
where You're going. How can we know
the way?"
6 Jesus told him, "I am the way, the
truth, and the life. No one comes to the
Father except through Me.
7 "If you know Me, you will also know
My Father. From now on you do know
Him and have seen Him."
8 "Lord," said Philip, "show us the
Father, and that's enough for us."
9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been among
you all this me without your knowingJOHN 14
94
Me, Philip? The one who has seen Me
has seen the Father. How can you say,
'Show us the Father'?
10 Don't you believe that I am in the
Father and the Father is in Me? The
words I speak to you I do not speak on
My own. The Father who lives in Me
does His works.
11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and
the Father is in Me. Otherwise, believe
because of the works themselves.
12 "I assure you: The one who believes
in Me will also do the works that I do.
And he will do even greater works than
these, because I am going to the Father.
13 Whatever you ask in My name, I will
do it so that the Father may be gloriﬁed
in the Son.
14 If you ask Me anything in My name, I
will do it.
15 "If you love Me, you will keep My
commandments.JOHN 14
95
16 And I will ask the Father, and He will
give you another Counselor to be with
you forever.
17 He is the Spirit of truth. The world is
unable to receive Him because it doesn't
see Him or know Him. But you do know
Him, because He remains with you and
will be in you.
18 I will not leave you as orphans; I am
coming to you.
19 "In a li le while the world will see Me
no longer, but you will see Me. Because I
live, you will live too.
20 In that day you will know that I am
in My Father, you are in Me, and I am in
you.
21 The one who has My commands and
keeps them is the one who loves Me.
And the one who loves Me will be loved
by My Father. I also will love him and will
reveal Myself to him."JOHN 14
96
22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him,
"Lord, how is it You're going to reveal
Yourself to us and not to the world?"
23 Jesus answered, "If anyone loves Me,
he will keep My word. My Father will
love him, and We will come to him and
make Our home with him.
24 The one who doesn't love Me will
not keep My words. The word that you
hear is not Mine but is from the Father
who sent Me.
25 "I have spoken these things to you
while I remain with you.
26 But the Counselor, the Holy
Spirit--the Father will send Him in My
name--will teach you all things and
remind you of everything I have told you.
27 "Peace I leave with you. My peace
I give to you. I do not give to you as
the world gives. Your heart must not be
troubled or fearful.JOHN 14 – 15
97
28 You have heard Me tell you, 'I am
going away and I am coming to you.' If
you loved Me, you would have rejoiced
that I am going to the Father, because
the Father is greater than I.
29 I have told you now before it happens
so that when it does happen you may
believe.
30 I will not talk with you much longer,
because the ruler of the world is coming.
He has no power over Me.
31 On the contrary, I am going away so
that the world may know that I love the
Father. Just as the Father commanded
Me, so I do. "Get up; let's leave this
place.
1 "I am the true vine, and My
Father is the vineyard keeper.
2 Every branch in Me that does not
produce fruit He removes, and He
prunes every branch that produces fruit
so that it will produce more fruit.
15JOHN 15
98
3 You are already clean because of the
word I have spoken to you.
4 Remain in Me, and I in you. Just as a
branch is unable to produce fruit by itself
unless it remains on the vine, so neither
can you unless you remain in Me.
5 "I am the vine; you are the branches.
The one who remains in Me and I in him
produces much fruit, because you can
do nothing without Me.
6 If anyone does not remain in Me, he
is thrown aside like a branch and he
withers. They gather them, throw them
into the ﬁre, and they are burned.
7 If you remain in Me and My words
remain in you, ask whatever you want
and it will be done for you.
8 My Father is gloriﬁed by this: that you
produce much fruit and prove to be My
disciples.
9 "As the Father has loved me, I have
also loved you. Remain in My love.JOHN 15
99
10 If you keep My commands you will
remain in My love, just as I have kept My
Father's commands and remain in His
love.
11 "I have spoken these things to you so
that My joy may be in you and your joy
may be complete.
12 This is My command: love one
another as I have loved you.
13 No one has greater love than this,
that someone would lay down his life for
his friends.
14 You are My friends if you do what I
command you.
15 I do not call you slaves anymore,
because a slave doesn't know what his
master is doing. I have called you friends,
because I have made known to you
everything I have heard from My Father.
16 You did not choose Me, but I chose
you. I appointed you that you should go
out and produce fruit and that your fruitJOHN 15
100
should remain, so that whatever you ask
the Father in My name, He will give you.
17 This is what I command you: love one
another.
18 "If the world hates you, understand
that it hated Me before it hated you.
19 If you were of the world, the world
would love you as its own. However,
because you are not of the world, but
I have chosen you out of it, the world
hates you.
20 Remember the word I spoke to you:
'A slave is not greater than his master.'
If they persecuted Me, they will also
persecute you. If they kept My word,
they will also keep yours.
21 But they will do all these things to
you on account of My name, because
they don't know the One who sent Me.
22 If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would not have sin. Now
they have no excuse for their sin.JOHN 15 – 16
101
23 The one who hates Me also hates My
Father.
24 If I had not done the works among
them that no one else has done, they
would not have sin. Now they have seen
and hated both Me and My Father.
25 But this happened so that the
statement wri en in their law might be
fulﬁlled: They hated Me for no reason.
26 "When the Counselor comes, the One
I will send to you from the Father--the
Spirit of truth who proceeds from the
Father--He will tes fy about Me.
27 You also will tes fy, because you
have been with Me from the beginning.
1 "I have told you these things to
keep you from stumbling.
2 They will ban you from the
synagogues. In fact, a me is coming
when anyone who kills you will think he
is oﬀering service to God.
16JOHN 16
102
3 They will do these things because they
haven't known the Father or Me.
4 But I have told you these things so
that when their me comes you may
remember I told them to you. I didn't
tell you these things from the beginning,
because I was with you.
5 "But now I am going away to Him who
sent Me, and not one of you asks Me,
'Where are You going?'
6 Yet, because I have spoken these
things to you, sorrow has ﬁlled your
heart.
7 Nevertheless, I am telling you the
truth. It is for your beneﬁt that I go away,
because if I don't go away the Counselor
will not come to you. If I go, I will send
Him to you.
8 When He comes, He will convict the
world about sin, righteousness, and
judgment:JOHN 16
103
9 about sin, because they do not believe
in Me;
10 about righteousness, because I am
going to the Father and you will no
longer see Me;
11 and about judgment, because the
ruler of this world has been judged.
12 "I s ll have many things to tell you,
but you can't bear them now.
13 When the Spirit of truth comes, He
will guide you into all the truth. For He
will not speak on His own, but He will
speak whatever He hears. He will also
declare to you what is to come.
14 He will glorify Me, because He will
take from what is Mine and declare it to
you.
15 Everything the Father has is Mine.
This is why I told you that He takes from
what is Mine and will declare it to you.JOHN 16
16 "A li
104
le while and you will no longer
see Me; again a li le while and you will
see Me."
17 Therefore some of His disciples said
to one another, "What is this He tells us:
'A li le while and you will not see Me;
again a li le while and you will see Me';
and, 'because I am going to the Father'?"
18 They said, "What is this He is saying,
'A li le while'? We don't know what He's
talking about!"
19 Jesus knew they wanted to ques on
Him, so He said to them, "Are you asking
one another about what I said, 'A li le
while and you will not see Me; again a
li le while and you will see Me'?
20 "I assure you: You will weep and
wail, but the world will rejoice. You will
become sorrowful, but your sorrow will
turn to joy.
21 When a woman is in labor she has
pain because her me has come. ButJOHN 16
105
when she has given birth to a child,
she no longer remembers the suﬀering
because of the joy that a person has
been born into the world.
22 So you also have sorrow now. But
I will see you again. Your hearts will
rejoice, and no one will rob you of your
joy.
23 In that day you will not ask Me
anything. "I assure you: Anything you ask
the Father in My name, He will give you.
24 Un l now you have asked for nothing
in My name. Ask and you will receive,
that your joy may be complete.
25 "I have spoken these things to you
in ﬁgures of speech. A me is coming
when I will no longer speak to you in
ﬁgures, but I will tell you plainly about
the Father.
26 In that day you will ask in My name.
I am not telling you that I will make
requests to the Father on your behalf.JOHN 16
106
27 For the Father Himself loves you,
because you have loved Me and have
believed that I came from God.
28 I came from the Father and have
come into the world. Again, I am leaving
the world and going to the Father."
29 "Ah!" His disciples said. "Now You're
speaking plainly and not using any
ﬁgura ve language.
30 Now we know that You know
everything and don't need anyone to
ques on You. By this we believe that You
came from God."
31 Jesus responded to them, "Do you
now believe?
32 Look: An hour is coming, and has
come, when each of you will be sca ered
to his own home, and you will leave Me
alone. Yet I am not alone, because the
Father is with Me.
33 I have told you these things so that in
Me you may have peace. You will haveJOHN 17
107
suﬀering in this world. Be courageous! I
have conquered the world."
1 Jesus spoke these things, looked
up to heaven, and said: Father,
the hour has come. Glorify Your Son so
that the Son may glorify You,
2 for You gave Him authority over all
ﬂesh; so He may give eternal life to all
You have given Him.
3 This is eternal life: that they may know
You, the only true God, and the One You
have sent--Jesus Christ.
4 I have gloriﬁed You on the earth by
comple ng the work You gave Me to do.
5 Now, Father, glorify Me in Your
presence with that glory I had with You
before the world existed.
6 I have revealed Your name to the men
You gave Me from the world. They were
Yours, You gave them to Me, and they
have kept Your word.
17JOHN 17
108
7 Now they know that all things You
have given to Me are from You,
8 because the words that You gave Me,
I have given them. They have received
them and have known for certain that I
came from You. They have believed that
You sent Me.
9 I pray for them. I am not praying for
the world but for those You have given
Me, because they are Yours.
10 All My things are Yours, and Yours are
Mine, and I have been gloriﬁed in them.
11 I am no longer in the world, but they
are in the world, and I am coming to
You. Holy Father, protect them by Your
name that You have given Me, so that
they may be one as We are one.
12 While I was with them, I was
protec ng them by Your name that You
have given Me. I guarded them and not
one of them is lost, except the son ofJOHN 17
109
destruc on, so that the Scripture may
be fulﬁlled.
13 Now I am coming to You, and I speak
these things in the world so that they
may have My joy completed in them.
14 I have given them Your word. The
world hated them because they are not
of the world, as I am not of the world.
15 I am not praying that You take them
out of the world but that You protect
them from the evil one.
16 They are not of the world, as I am not
of the world.
17 Sanc fy them by the truth; Your
word is truth.
18 As You sent Me into the world, I also
have sent them into the world.
19 I sanc fy Myself for them, so they
also may be sanc ﬁed by the truth.
20 I pray not only for these, but also for
those who believe in Me through their
message.JOHN 17
110
21 May they all be one, as You, Father,
are in Me and I am in You. May they also
be one in Us, so the world may believe
You sent Me.
22 I have given them the glory You have
given Me. May they be one as We are
one.
23 I am in them and You are in Me. May
they be made completely one, so the
world may know You have sent Me and
have loved them as You have loved Me.
24 Father, I desire those You have given
Me to be with Me where I am. Then they
will see My glory, which You have given
Me because You loved Me before the
world's founda on.
25 Righteous Father! The world has not
known You. However, I have known You,
and these have known that You sent Me.
26 I made Your name known to them
and will make it known, so the love YouJOHN 18
111
have loved Me with may be in them and
I may be in them.
1 A er Jesus had said these
things, He went out with His
disciples across the Kidron Valley, where
there was a garden, and He and His
disciples went into it.
2 Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew
the place, because Jesus o en met there
with His disciples.
3 So Judas took a company of soldiers
and some temple police from the chief
priests and the Pharisees and came there
with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
4 Then Jesus, knowing everything that
was about to happen to Him, went out
and said to them, "Who is it you're
looking for?"
5 "Jesus the Nazarene," they answered.
"I am He," Jesus told them. Judas, who
betrayed Him, was also standing with
them.
18JOHN 18
112
6 When He told them, "I am He," they
stepped back and fell to the ground.
7 Then He asked them again, "Who
is it you're looking for?" "Jesus the
Nazarene," they said.
8 "I told you I am He ," Jesus replied.
"So if you're looking for Me, let these
men go."
9 This was to fulﬁll the words He had
said: "I have not lost one of those You
have given Me."
10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword,
drew it, struck the high priest's slave,
and cut oﬀ his right ear. (The slave's
name was Malchus.)
11 At that, Jesus said to Peter, "Sheathe
your sword! Am I not to drink the cup
the Father has given Me?"
12 Then the company of soldiers, the
commander, and the Jewish temple
police arrested Jesus and ed Him up.JOHN 18
113
13 First they led Him to Annas, for he
was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who
was high priest that year.
14 Caiaphas was the one who
had advised the Jews that it was
advantageous that one man should die
for the people.
15 Meanwhile Simon Peter was
following Jesus, as was another disciple.
That disciple was an acquaintance of the
high priest; so he went with Jesus into
the high priest's courtyard.
16 But Peter remained standing outside
by the door. So the other disciple, the
one known to the high priest, went
out and spoke to the girl who was the
doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
17 Then the slave girl who was the
doorkeeper said to Peter, "You aren't
one of this man's disciples too, are you?"
"I am not!" he said.JOHN 18
114
18 Now the slaves and the temple police
had made a charcoal ﬁre, because it was
cold. They were standing there warming
themselves, and Peter was standing with
them, warming himself.
19 The high priest ques oned Jesus
about His disciples and about His
teaching.
20 "I have spoken openly to the world,"
Jesus answered him. "I have always
taught in the synagogue and in the
temple complex, where all the Jews
congregate, and I haven't spoken
anything in secret.
21 Why do you ques on Me? Ques on
those who heard what I told them. Look,
they know what I said."
22 When He had said these things, one
of the temple police standing by slapped
Jesus, saying, "Is this the way you answer
the high priest?"JOHN 18
115
23 "If I have spoken wrongly," Jesus
answered him, "give evidence about
the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit
Me?"
24 Then Annas sent Him bound to
Caiaphas the high priest.
25 Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said to him, "You
aren't one of His disciples too, are you?"
He denied it and said, "I am not!"
26 One of the high priest's slaves, a
rela ve of the man whose ear Peter had
cut oﬀ, said, "Didn't I see you with Him
in the garden?"
27 Peter then denied it again.
Immediately a rooster crowed.
28 Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas
to the governor's headquarters. It was
early morning. They did not enter the
headquarters themselves; otherwise
they would be deﬁled and unable to eat
the Passover.JOHN 18
116
29 Then Pilate came out to them and
said, "What charge do you bring against
this man?"
30 They answered him, "If this man
weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have
handed Him over to you."
31 So Pilate told them, "Take Him
yourselves and judge Him according to
your law." "It's not legal for us to put
anyone to death," the Jews declared.
32 They said this so that Jesus' words
might be fulﬁlled signifying what sort of
death He was going to die.
33 Then Pilate went back into the
headquarters, summoned Jesus, and
said to Him, "Are You the King of the
Jews?"
34 Jesus answered, "Are you asking this
on your own, or have others told you
about Me?"
35 "I'm not a Jew, am I?" Pilate replied.
"Your own na on and the chief priestsJOHN 18
117
handed You over to me. What have You
done?"
36 "My kingdom is not of this world,"
said Jesus. "If My kingdom were of this
world, My servants would ﬁght, so that
I wouldn't be handed over to the Jews.
As it is, My kingdom does not have its
origin here."
37 "You are a king then?" Pilate asked.
"You say that I'm a king," Jesus replied. "I
was born for this, and I have come into
the world for this: to tes fy to the truth.
Everyone who is of the truth listens to
My voice."
38 "What is truth?" said Pilate. A er he
had said this, he went out to the Jews
again and told them, "I ﬁnd no grounds
for charging Him.
39 You have a custom that I release one
prisoner to you at the Passover. So, do
you want me to release to you the King
of the Jews?"JOHN 18 – 19
118
40 They shouted back, "Not this man,
but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a
revolu onary.
1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had
Him ﬂogged.
2 The soldiers also twisted together a
crown of thorns, put it on His head, and
threw a purple robe around Him.
3 And they repeatedly came up to Him
and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and
were slapping His face.
4 Pilate went outside again and said to
them, "Look, I'm bringing Him outside to
you to let you know I ﬁnd no grounds for
charging Him."
5 Then Jesus came out wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple robe.
Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
6 When the chief priests and the temple
police saw Him, they shouted, "Crucify!
Crucify!" Pilate responded, "Take Him
19JOHN 19
119
and crucify Him yourselves, for I ﬁnd no
grounds for charging Him."
7 "We have a law," the Jews replied to
him, "and according to that law He must
die, because He made Himself the Son
of God."
8 When Pilate heard this statement, he
was more afraid than ever.
9 He went back into the headquarters
and asked Jesus, "Where are You from?"
But Jesus did not give him an answer.
10 So Pilate said to Him, "You're not
talking to me? Don't You know that I
have the authority to release You and
the authority to crucify You?"
11 "You would have no authority over
Me at all," Jesus answered him, "if it
hadn't been given you from above. This
is why the one who handed Me over to
you has the greater sin."
12 From that moment Pilate made
every eﬀort to release Him. But the JewsJOHN 19
120
shouted, "If you release this man, you
are not Caesar's friend. Anyone who
makes himself a king opposes Caesar!"
13 When Pilate heard these words, he
brought Jesus outside. He sat down
on the judge's bench in a place called
the Stone Pavement (but in Hebrew
Gabbatha).
14 It was the prepara on day for the
Passover, and it was about six in the
morning. Then he told the Jews, "Here is
your king!"
15 But they shouted, "Take Him away!
Take Him away! Crucify Him!" Pilate said
to them, "Should I crucify your king?"
"We have no king but Caesar!" the chief
priests answered.
16 So then, because of them, he handed
Him over to be cruciﬁed. Therefore they
took Jesus away.JOHN 19
121
17 Carrying His own cross, He went out
to what is called Skull Place, which in
Hebrew is called Golgotha.
18 There they cruciﬁed Him and two
others with Him, one on either side, with
Jesus in the middle.
19 Pilate also had a sign le ered and put
on the cross. The inscrip on was: JESUS
THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS
20 Many of the Jews read this sign,
because the place where Jesus was
cruciﬁed was near the city, and it was
wri en in Hebrew, La n, and Greek.
21 So the chief priests of the Jews said
to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The King of the
Jews,' but that He said, 'I am the King of
the Jews.'"
22 Pilate replied, "What I have wri en, I
have wri en."
23 When the soldiers cruciﬁed Jesus,
they took His clothes and divided them
into four parts, a part for each soldier.JOHN 19
122
They also took the tunic, which was
seamless, woven in one piece from the
top.
24 So they said to one another, "Let's
not tear it, but toss for it, to see who gets
it." They did this to fulﬁll the Scripture
that says: They divided My clothes
among themselves, and they cast lots
for My clothing. And this is what the
soldiers did.
25 Standing by the cross of Jesus were
His mother, His mother's sister, Mary the
wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
26 When Jesus saw His mother and the
disciple He loved standing there, He said
to His mother, "Woman, here is your
son."
27 Then He said to the disciple, "Here is
your mother." And from that hour the
disciple took her into his home.
28 A er this, when Jesus knew that
everything was now accomplished thatJOHN 19
123
the Scripture might be fulﬁlled, He said,
"I'm thirsty!"
29 A jar full of sour wine was si ng
there; so they ﬁxed a sponge full of sour
wine on hyssop and held it up to His
mouth.
30 When Jesus had received the sour
wine, He said, "It is ﬁnished!" Then
bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
31 Since it was the prepara on day,
the Jews did not want the bodies to
remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for
that Sabbath was a special day). They
requested that Pilate have the men's
legs broken and that their bodies be
taken away.
32 So the soldiers came and broke the
legs of the ﬁrst man and of the other
one who had been cruciﬁed with Him.
33 When they came to Jesus, they did
not break His legs since they saw that He
was already dead.JOHN 19
124
34 But one of the soldiers pierced His
side with a spear, and at once blood and
water came out.
35 He who saw this has tes ﬁed so that
you also may believe. His tes mony
is true, and he knows he is telling the
truth.
36 For these things happened so that
the Scripture would be fulﬁlled: Not one
of His bones will be broken.
37 Also, another Scripture says: They
will look at the One they pierced.
38 A er this, Joseph of Arimathea, who
was a disciple of Jesus--but secretly
because of his fear of the Jews--asked
Pilate that he might remove Jesus' body.
Pilate gave him permission, so he came
and took His body away.
39 Nicodemus (who had previously
come to Him at night) also came,
bringing a mixture of about 75 pounds
of myrrh and aloes.JOHN 19 – 20
125
40 Then they took Jesus' body and
wrapped it in linen cloths with the
aroma c spices, according to the burial
custom of the Jews.
41 There was a garden in the place
where He was cruciﬁed. A new tomb
was in the garden; no one had yet been
placed in it.
42 They place Jesus there because of
the Jewish prepara on and since the
tomb was nearby.
1 On the ﬁrst day of the week
Mary Magdalene came to the
tomb early, while it was s ll dark. She
saw that the stone had been removed
from the tomb.
2 So she ran to Simon Peter and to the
other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and
said to them, "They have taken the Lord
out of the tomb, and we don't know
where they have put Him!"
20JOHN 20
126
3 At that, Peter and the other disciple
went out, heading for the tomb.
4 The two were running together, but
the other disciple outran Peter and got
to the tomb ﬁrst.
5 Stooping down, he saw the linen
cloths lying there, yet he did not go in.
6 Then, following him, Simon Peter
came also. He entered the tomb and saw
the linen cloths lying there.
7 The wrapping that had been on His
head was not lying with the linen cloths
but was folded up in a separate place by
itself.
8 The other disciple, who had reached
the tomb ﬁrst, then entered the tomb,
saw, and believed.
9 For they s ll did not understand the
Scripture that He must rise from the
dead.
10 Then the disciples went home again.JOHN 20
127
11 But Mary stood outside facing the
tomb, crying. As she was crying, she
stooped to look into the tomb.
12 She saw two angels in white si ng
there, one at the head and one at the
feet, where Jesus' body had been lying.
13 They said to her, "Woman, why are
you crying?" "Because they've taken
away my Lord," she told them, "and I
don't know where they've put Him."
14 Having said this, she turned around
and saw Jesus standing there, though
she did not know it was Jesus.
15 "Woman," Jesus said to her, "why are
you crying? Who is it you are looking
for?" Supposing He was the gardener,
she replied, "Sir, if you've removed Him,
tell me where you've put Him, and I will
take Him away."
16 Jesus said, "Mary." Turning around,
she said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabbouni!"-
-which means "Teacher."JOHN 20
128
17 "Don't cling to Me," Jesus told her,
"for I have not yet ascended to the
Father. But go to My brothers and tell
them that I am ascending to My Father
and your Father--to My God and your
God."
18 Mary Magdalene went and
announced to the disciples, "I have seen
the Lord!" And she told them what He
had said to her.
19 In the evening of that ﬁrst day of
the week, the disciples were gathered
together with the doors locked because
of their fear of the Jews. Then Jesus
came, stood among them, and said to
them, "Peace to you!"
20 Having said this, He showed them
His hands and His side. So the disciples
rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace to
you! As the Father has sent Me, I also
send you."JOHN 20
22 A
129
er saying this, He breathed on
them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are
forgiven them; if you retain the sins of
any, they are retained."
24 But one of the Twelve, Thomas
(called "Twin"), was not with them when
Jesus came.
25 So the other disciples kept telling
him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he
said to them, "If I don't see the mark of
the nails in His hands, put my ﬁnger into
the mark of the nails, and put my hand
into His side, I will never believe!"
26 A er eight days His disciples were
indoors again, and Thomas was with
them. Even though the doors were
locked, Jesus came and stood among
them. He said, "Peace to you!"
27 Then He said to Thomas, "Put your
ﬁnger here and observe My hands.
Reach out your hand and put it intoJOHN 20 – 21
130
My side. Don't be an unbeliever, but a
believer."
28 Thomas responded to Him, "My Lord
and my God!"
29 Jesus said, "Because you have seen
Me, you have believed. Those who
believe without seeing are blessed."
30 Jesus performed many other signs in
the presence of His disciples that are not
wri en in this book.
31 But these are wri en so that you may
believe Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of
God, and by believing you may have life
in His name.
1 A er this, Jesus revealed
Himself again to His disciples by
the Sea of Tiberias. He revealed Himself
in this way:
2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called "Twin"),
Nathanael from Cana of Galilee,
Zebedee's sons, and two others of His
disciples were together.
21JOHN 21
131
3 "I'm going ﬁshing," Simon Peter said
to them. "We're coming with you," they
told him. They went out and got into the
boat, but that night they caught nothing.
4 When daybreak came, Jesus stood on
the shore. However, the disciples did not
know it was Jesus.
5 "Men," Jesus called to them, "you
don't have any ﬁsh, do you?" "No," they
answered.
6 "Cast the net on the right side of
the boat," He told them, "and you'll
ﬁnd some." So they did, and they were
unable to haul it in because of the large
number of ﬁsh.
7 Therefore the disciple, the one Jesus
loved, said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"
When Simon Peter heard that it was the
Lord, he ed his outer garment around
him (for he was stripped) and plunged
into the sea.JOHN 21
132
8 But since they were not far from
land (about 100 yards away), the other
disciples came in the boat, dragging the
net full of ﬁsh.
9 When they got out on land, they saw
a charcoal ﬁre there, with ﬁsh lying on it,
and bread.
10 "Bring some of the ﬁsh you've just
caught," Jesus told them.
11 So Simon Peter got up and hauled
the net ashore, full of large ﬁsh--153 of
them. Even though there were so many,
the net was not torn.
12 "Come and have breakfast," Jesus
told them. None of the disciples dared
ask Him, "Who are You?" because they
knew it was the Lord.
13 Jesus came, took the bread, and gave
it to them. He did the same with the ﬁsh.
14 This was now the third me Jesus
appeared to the disciples a er He was
raised from the dead.JOHN 21
133
15 When they had eaten breakfast,
Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of
John, do you love Me more than these?"
"Yes, Lord," he said to Him, "You know
that I love You." "Feed My lambs," He
told him.
16 A second me He asked him, "Simon,
son of John, do you love Me?" "Yes,
Lord," he said to Him, "You know that I
love You." "Shepherd My sheep," He told
him.
17 He asked him the third me, "Simon,
son of John, do you love Me?" Peter
was grieved that He asked him the third
me, "Do you love Me?" He said, "Lord,
You know everything! You know that I
love You." "Feed My sheep," Jesus said.
18 "I assure you: When you were
young, you would e your belt and walk
wherever you wanted. But when you
grow old, you will stretch out your handsJOHN 21
134
and someone else will e you and carry
you where you don't want to go."
19 He said this to signify by what kind of
death he would glorify God. A er saying
this, He told him, "Follow Me!"
20 So Peter turned around and saw the
disciple Jesus loved following them. That
disciple was the one who had leaned
back against Jesus at the supper and
asked, "Lord, who is the one that's going
to betray You?"
21 When Peter saw him, he said to
Jesus, "Lord--what about him?"
22 "If I want him to remain un l I come,"
Jesus answered, "what is that to you? As
for you, follow Me."
23 So this report spread to the brothers
that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus
did not tell him that he would not die,
but, "If I want him to remain un l I come,
what is that to you?"JOHN 21
24 This is the disciple who tes
135
ﬁes to
these things and who wrote them down.
We know that his tes mony is true.
25 And there are also many other things
that Jesus did, which, if they were
wri en one by one, I suppose not even
the world itself could contain the books
that would be wri en.Acts of the Apostles
1 I wrote the ﬁrst narra
ve,
Theophilus, about all that Jesus
began to do and teach
2 un l the day He was taken up, a er He
had given orders through the Holy Spirit
to the apostles whom He had chosen.
3 A er He had suﬀered, He also
presented Himself alive to them by many
convincing proofs, appearing to them
during 40 days and speaking about the
kingdom of God.
4 While He was together with them,
He commanded them not to leave
Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father's
promise. "This," He said, "is what you
heard from Me;
1ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5 for John bap
2
zed with water, but you
will be bap zed with the Holy Spirit not
many days from now."
6 So when they had come together,
they asked Him, "Lord, at this me are
You restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
7 He said to them, "It is not for you to
know mes or periods that the Father
has set by His own authority.
8 But you will receive power when the
Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you
will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, in all
Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of
the earth."
9 A er He had said this, He was taken
up as they were watching, and a cloud
received Him out of their sight.
10 While He was going, they were gazing
into heaven, and suddenly two men in
white clothes stood by them.
11 They said, "Men of Galilee, why do
you stand looking up into heaven? ThisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
3
Jesus, who has been taken from you into
heaven, will come in the same way that
you have seen Him going into heaven."
12 Then they returned to Jerusalem
from the mount called Olive Grove,
which is near Jerusalem--a Sabbath day's
journey away.
13 When they arrived, they went to the
room upstairs where they were staying:
Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip,
Thomas, Bartholomew, Ma hew, James
the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,
and Judas the son of James.
14 All these were con nually united in
prayer, along with the women, including
Mary the mother of Jesus, and His
brothers.
15 During these days Peter stood up
among the brothers--the number of
people who were together was about
120--and said:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
4
16 "Brothers, the Scripture had to be
fulﬁlled that the Holy Spirit through the
mouth of David spoke in advance about
Judas, who became a guide to those
who arrested Jesus.
17 For he was one of our number and
was allo ed a share in this ministry."
18 Now this man acquired a ﬁeld with
his unrighteous wages; and falling
headﬁrst, he burst open in the middle,
and all his insides spilled out.
19 This became known to all the
residents of Jerusalem, so that in
their own language that ﬁeld is called
Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.
20 "For it is wri en in the Book of
Psalms: Let his dwelling become
desolate; let no one live in it; and Let
someone else take his posi on.
21 "Therefore, from among the men
who have accompanied us during theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1 – 2
5
whole me the Lord Jesus went in and
out among us--
22 beginning from the bap sm of John
un l the day He was taken up from
us--from among these, it is necessary
that one become a witness with us of
His resurrec on."
23 So they proposed two: Joseph, called
Barsabbas, who was also known as
Justus, and Ma hias.
24 Then they prayed, "You, Lord, know
the hearts of all; show which of these
two You have chosen
25 to take the place in this apostolic
service that Judas le to go to his own
place."
26 Then they cast lots for them, and the
lot fell to Ma hias. So he was numbered
with the 11 apostles.
1 When the day of Pentecost had
arrived, they were all together in one
place.
2ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
6
2 Suddenly a sound like that of a violent
rushing wind came from heaven, and it
ﬁlled the whole house where they were
staying.
3 And tongues, like ﬂames of ﬁre that
were divided, appeared to them and
rested on each one of them.
4 Then they were all ﬁlled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in diﬀerent
languages, as the Spirit gave them ability
for speech.
5 There were Jews living in Jerusalem,
devout men from every na on under
heaven.
6 When this sound occurred, the
mul tude came together and was
confused because each one heard them
speaking in his own language.
7 And they were astounded and
amazed, saying, "Look, aren't all these
who are speaking Galileans?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
7
8 How is it that we hear, each of us, in
our own na ve language?
9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites; those
who live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and
Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and
the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors
from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
11 Cretans and Arabs--we hear them
speaking in our own languages the
magniﬁcent acts of God."
12 And they were all astounded and
perplexed, saying to one another, "What
could this be?"
13 But some sneered and said, "They're
full of new wine!"
14 But Peter stood up with the Eleven,
raised his voice, and proclaimed to
them: "Jewish men and all you residents
of Jerusalem, let this be known to you
and pay a en on to my words.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
8
15 For these people are not drunk, as
you suppose, since it's only nine in the
morning.
16 On the contrary, this is what was
spoken through the prophet Joel:
17 And it will be in the last days, says
God, that I will pour out My Spirit on
all humanity; then your sons and your
daughters will prophesy, your young
men will see visions, and your old men
will dream dreams.
18 I will even pour out My Spirit on My
male and female slaves in those days,
and they will prophesy.
19 I will display wonders in the heaven
above and signs on the earth below:
blood and ﬁre and a cloud of smoke.
20 The sun will be turned to darkness,
and the moon to blood, before the great
and remarkable day of the Lord comes;
21 then whoever calls on the name of
the Lord will be saved.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
9
22 "Men of Israel, listen to these words:
This Jesus the Nazarene was a man
pointed out to you by God with miracles,
wonders, and signs that God did among
you through Him, just as you yourselves
know.
23 Though He was delivered up
according to God's determined plan and
foreknowledge, you used lawless people
to nail Him to a cross and kill Him.
24 God raised Him up, ending the pains
of death, because it was not possible for
Him to be held by it.
25 For David says of Him: I saw the Lord
ever before me; because He is at my
right hand, I will not be shaken.
26 Therefore my heart was glad, and my
tongue rejoiced. Moreover my ﬂesh will
rest in hope,
27 because You will not leave my soul
in Hades, or allow Your Holy One to see
decay.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
10
28 You have revealed the paths of life to
me; You will ﬁll me with gladness in Your
presence.
29 "Brothers, I can conﬁdently speak to
you about the patriarch David: he is both
dead and buried, and his tomb is with us
to this day.
30 Since he was a prophet, he knew that
God had sworn an oath to him to seat
one of his descendants on his throne.
31 Seeing this in advance, he spoke
concerning the resurrec on of the
Messiah: He was not le in Hades, and
His ﬂesh did not experience decay.
32 "God has resurrected this Jesus. We
are all witnesses of this.
33 Therefore, since He has been exalted
to the right hand of God and has
received from the Father the promised
Holy Spirit, He has poured out what you
both see and hear.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
11
34 For it was not David who ascended
into the heavens, but he himself says:
The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right
hand
35 un l I make Your enemies Your
footstool.'
36 "Therefore let all the house of Israel
know with certainty that God has made
this Jesus, whom you cruciﬁed, both
Lord and Messiah!"
37 When they heard this, they were
pierced to the heart and said to Peter
and the rest of the apostles: "Brothers,
what must we do?"
38 "Repent," Peter said to them, "and
be bap zed, each of you, in the name of
Jesus the Messiah for the forgiveness of
your sins, and you will receive the gi of
the Holy Spirit.
39 For the promise is for you and for
your children, and for all who are far oﬀ,
as many as the Lord our God will call."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
12
40 And with many other words he
tes ﬁed and strongly urged them,
saying, "Be saved from this corrupt
genera on!"
41 So those who accepted his message
were bap zed, and that day about 3,000
people were added to them.
42 And they devoted themselves to the
apostles' teaching, to fellowship, to the
breaking of bread, and to prayers.
43 Then fear came over everyone, and
many wonders and signs were being
performed through the apostles.
44 Now all the believers were together
and had everything in common.
45 So they sold their possessions and
property and distributed the proceeds
to all, as anyone had a need.
46 And every day they devoted
themselves to mee ng together in the
temple complex, and broke bread fromACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2 – 3
13
house to house. They ate their food with
gladness and simplicity of heart,
47 praising God and having favor with
all the people. And every day the Lord
added to them those who were being
saved.
1 Now Peter and John were going
up together to the temple complex
at the hour of prayer at three in the
a ernoon.
2 And a man who was lame from his
mother's womb was carried there and
placed every day at the temple gate
called Beau ful, so he could beg from
those entering the temple complex.
3 When he saw Peter and John about to
enter the temple complex, he asked for
help.
4 Peter, along with John, looked at him
intently and said, "Look at us."
5 So he turned to them, expec ng to
get something from them.
3ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
14
6 But Peter said, "I have neither silver
nor gold, but what I have, I give to you: In
the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene,
get up and walk!"
7 Then, taking him by the right hand he
raised him up, and at once his feet and
ankles became strong.
8 So he jumped up, stood, and started
to walk, and he entered the temple
complex with them--walking, leaping,
and praising God.
9 All the people saw him walking and
praising God,
10 and they recognized that he was
the one who used to sit and beg at the
Beau ful Gate of the temple complex.
So they were ﬁlled with awe and
astonishment at what had happened to
him.
11 While he was holding on to Peter and
John, all the people, greatly amazed, ranACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
15
toward them in what is called Solomon's
Colonnade.
12 When Peter saw this, he addressed
the people: "Men of Israel, why are you
amazed at this? Or why do you stare
at us, as though by our own power or
godliness we had made him walk?
13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, the God of our fathers, has
gloriﬁed His Servant Jesus, whom you
handed over and denied in the presence
of Pilate, when he had decided to release
Him.
14 But you denied the Holy and
Righteous One, and asked to have a
murderer given to you.
15 And you killed the source of life,
whom God raised from the dead; we are
witnesses of this.
16 By faith in His name, His name has
made this man strong, whom you see
and know. So the faith that comesACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
16
through Him has given him this perfect
health in front of all of you.
17 "And now, brothers, I know that you
did it in ignorance, just as your leaders
also did.
18 But what God predicted through
the mouth of all the prophets--that His
Messiah would suﬀer--He has fulﬁlled in
this way.
19 Therefore repent and turn back, that
your sins may be wiped out so that
seasons of refreshing may come from
the presence of the Lord,
20 and He may send Jesus, who has
been appointed Messiah for you.
21 Heaven must welcome Him un l the
mes of the restora on of all things,
which God spoke about by the mouth of
His holy prophets from the beginning.
22 Moses said: The Lord your God will
raise up for you a Prophet like me fromACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3 – 4
17
among your brothers. You must listen to
Him in everything He will say to you.
23 And it will be that everyone who
will not listen to that Prophet will be
completely cut oﬀ from the people.
24 "In addi on, all the prophets who
have spoken, from Samuel and those
a er him, have also announced these
days.
25 You are the sons of the prophets and
of the covenant that God made with
your forefathers, saying to Abraham,
And in your seed all the families of the
earth will be blessed.
26 God raised up His Servant and sent
Him ﬁrst to you to bless you by turning
each of you from your evil ways."
1 Now as they were speaking to the
people, the priests, the commander
of the temple guard, and the Sadducees
confronted them,
4ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
18
2 because they were provoked that
they were teaching the people and
proclaiming in the person of Jesus the
resurrec on from the dead.
3 So they seized them and put them in
custody un l the next day, since it was
already evening.
4 But many of those who heard the
message believed, and the number of
the men came to about 5,000.
5 The next day, their rulers, elders, and
scribes assembled in Jerusalem
6 with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas,
John and Alexander, and all the members
of the high-priestly family.
7 A er they had Peter and John stand
before them, they asked the ques on:
"By what power or in what name have
you done this?"
8 Then Peter was ﬁlled with the Holy
Spirit and said to them, "Rulers of the
people and elders:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
19
9 If we are being examined today about
a good deed done to a disabled man--by
what means he was healed--
10 let it be known to all of you and to all
the people of Israel, that by the name
of Jesus Christ the Nazarene--whom you
cruciﬁed and whom God raised from the
dead--by Him this man is standing here
before you healthy.
11 This Jesus is The stone despised
by you builders, who has become the
cornerstone.
12 There is salva on in no one else, for
there is no other name under heaven
given to people by which we must be
saved."
13 When they observed the boldness of
Peter and John and realized that they
were uneducated and untrained men,
they were amazed and knew that they
had been with Jesus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
20
14 And since they saw the man who had
been healed standing with them, they
had nothing to say in response.
15 A er they had ordered them to leave
the Sanhedrin, they conferred among
themselves,
16 saying, "What should we do with
these men? For an obvious sign, evident
to all who live in Jerusalem, has been
done through them, and we cannot deny
it!
17 But so this does not spread any
further among the people, let's threaten
them against speaking to anyone in this
name again."
18 So they called for them and ordered
them not to preach or teach at all in the
name of Jesus.
19 But Peter and John answered them,
"Whether it's right in the sight of God for
us to listen to you rather than to God,
you decide;ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
21
20 for we are unable to stop speaking
about what we have seen and heard."
21 A er threatening them further, they
released them. They found no way to
punish them, because the people were
all giving glory to God over what had
been done;
22 for the man was over 40 years old
on whom this sign of healing had been
performed.
23 A er they were released, they went
to their own fellowship and reported all
that the chief priests and the elders had
said to them.
24 When they heard this, they raised
their voices to God unanimously and
said, "Master, You are the One who
made the heaven, the earth, and the
sea, and everything in them.
25 You said through the Holy Spirit,
by the mouth of our father David YourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
22
servant: Why did the Gen les rage, and
the peoples plot fu le things?
26 The kings of the earth took their
stand, and the rulers assembled together
against the Lord and against His Messiah.
27 "For, in fact, in this city both Herod
and Pon us Pilate, with the Gen les
and the peoples of Israel, assembled
together against Your holy Servant Jesus,
whom You anointed,
28 to do whatever Your hand and Your
plan had predes ned to take place.
29 And now, Lord, consider their threats,
and grant that Your slaves may speak
Your message with complete boldness,
30 while You stretch out Your hand
for healing, signs, and wonders to be
performed through the name of Your
holy Servant Jesus."
31 When they had prayed, the place
where they were assembled was shaken,
and they were all ﬁlled with the HolyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
23
Spirit and began to speak God's message
with boldness.
32 Now the mul tude of those who
believed were of one heart and soul, and
no one said that any of his possessions
was his own, but instead they held
everything in common.
33 And with great power the apostles
were giving tes mony to the resurrec on
of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was
on all of them.
34 For there was not a needy person
among them, because all those who
owned lands or houses sold them,
brought the proceeds of the things that
were sold,
35 and laid them at the apostles' feet.
This was then distributed to each person
as anyone had a need.
36 Joseph, a Levite and a Cypriot
by birth, whom the apostles namedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4 – 5
24
Barnabas, which is translated Son of
Encouragement,
37 sold a ﬁeld he owned, brought the
money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
1 But a man named Ananias, with
Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of
property.
2 However, he kept back part of the
proceeds with his wife's knowledge, and
brought a por on of it and laid it at the
apostles' feet.
3 Then Peter said, "Ananias, why has
Satan ﬁlled your heart to lie to the Holy
Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds
from the ﬁeld?
4 Wasn't it yours while you possessed
it? And a er it was sold, wasn't it at your
disposal? Why is it that you planned this
thing in your heart? You have not lied to
men but to God!"
5ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
25
5 When he heard these words, Ananias
dropped dead, and a great fear came on
all who heard.
6 The young men got up, wrapped his
body , carried him out, and buried him.
7 There was an interval of about
three hours; then his wife came in, not
knowing what had happened.
8 "Tell me," Peter asked her, "did you
sell the ﬁeld for this price?" "Yes," she
said, "for that price."
9 Then Peter said to her, "Why did you
agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look!
The feet of those who have buried your
husband are at the door, and they will
carry you out!"
10 Instantly she dropped dead at his
feet. When the young men came in, they
found her dead, carried her out, and
buried her beside her husband.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
26
11 Then great fear came on the whole
church and on all who heard these
things.
12 Many signs and wonders were being
done among the people through the
hands of the apostles. By common
consent they would all meet in
Solomon's Colonnade.
13 None of the rest dared to join them,
but the people praised them highly.
14 Believers were added to the Lord
in increasing numbers--crowds of both
men and women.
15 As a result, they would carry the
sick out into the streets and lay them
on beds and pallets so that when Peter
came by, at least his shadow might fall
on some of them.
16 In addi on, a mul tude came
together from the towns surrounding
Jerusalem, bringing sick people andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
27
those who were tormented by unclean
spirits, and they were all healed.
17 Then the high priest took ac on.
He and all his colleagues, those who
belonged to the party of the Sadducees,
were ﬁlled with jealousy.
18 So they arrested the apostles and put
them in the city jail.
19 But an angel of the Lord opened
the doors of the jail during the night,
brought them out, and said,
20 "Go and stand in the temple complex,
and tell the people all about this life."
21 In obedience to this, they entered
the temple complex at daybreak and
began to teach. When the high priest
and those who were with him arrived,
they convened the Sanhedrin--the full
Senate of the sons of Israel--and sent
orders to the jail to have them brought.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
28
22 But when the temple police got
there, they did not ﬁnd them in the jail,
so they returned and reported,
23 "We found the jail securely locked,
with the guards standing in front of the
doors; but when we opened them, we
found no one inside!"
24 As the captain of the temple police
and the chief priests heard these things,
they were baﬄed about them, as to
what could come of this.
25 Someone came and reported to
them, "Look! The men you put in jail
are standing in the temple complex and
teaching the people."
26 Then the captain went with the
temple police and brought them in
without force, because they were afraid
the people might stone them.
27 When they had brought them in, they
had them stand before the Sanhedrin,
and the high priest asked,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
29
28 "Didn't we strictly order you not to
teach in this name? And look, you have
ﬁlled Jerusalem with your teaching and
are determined to bring this man's blood
on us!"
29 But Peter and the apostles replied,
"We must obey God rather than men.
30 The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus, whom you had murdered by
hanging Him on a tree.
31 God exalted this man to His right
hand as ruler and Savior, to grant
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of
sins.
32 We are witnesses of these things,
and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has
given to those who obey Him."
33 When they heard this, they were
enraged and wanted to kill them.
34 A Pharisee named Gamaliel, a
teacher of the law who was respected by
all the people, stood up in the SanhedrinACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
30
and ordered the men to be taken outside
for a li le while.
35 He said to them, "Men of Israel, be
careful about what you're going to do to
these men.
36 Not long ago Theudas rose up,
claiming to be somebody, and a group
of about 400 men rallied to him. He
was killed, and all his par sans were
dispersed and came to nothing.
37 A er this man, Judas the Galilean
rose up in the days of the census and
a racted a following. That man also
perished, and all his par sans were
sca ered.
38 And now, I tell you, stay away from
these men and leave them alone. For if
this plan or this work is of men, it will be
overthrown;
39 but if it is of God, you will not be
able to overthrow them. You may evenACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5 – 6
31
be found ﬁgh ng against God." So they
were persuaded by him.
40 A er they called in the apostles and
had them ﬂogged, they ordered them
not to speak in the name of Jesus and
released them.
41 Then they went out from the
presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to be
dishonored on behalf of the name.
42 Every day in the temple complex,
and in various homes, they con nued
teaching and proclaiming the good news
that the Messiah is Jesus.
1 In those days, as the number of
the disciples was mul plying, there
arose a complaint by the Hellenis c
Jews against the Hebraic Jews that their
widows were being overlooked in the
daily distribu on.
2 Then the Twelve summoned the
whole company of the disciples and said,
6ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
32
"It would not be right for us to give up
preaching about God to wait on tables.
3 Therefore, brothers, select from
among you seven men of good
reputa on, full of the Spirit and wisdom,
whom we can appoint to this duty.
4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer
and to the preaching ministry."
5 The proposal pleased the whole
company. So they chose Stephen, a
man full of faith and the Holy Spirit,
and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon,
Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte
from An och.
6 They had them stand before the
apostles, who prayed and laid their
hands on them.
7 So the preaching about God
ﬂourished, the number of the disciples
in Jerusalem mul plied greatly, and a
large group of priests became obedient
to the faith.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
33
8 Stephen, full of grace and power, was
performing great wonders and signs
among the people.
9 Then some from what is called the
Freedmen's Synagogue, composed
of both Cyrenians and Alexandrians,
and some from Cilicia and Asia, came
forward and disputed with Stephen.
10 But they were unable to stand up
against the wisdom and the Spirit by
whom he spoke.
11 Then they induced men to say, "We
heard him speaking blasphemous words
against Moses and God!"
12 They s rred up the people, the
elders, and the scribes; so they came up,
dragged him oﬀ, and took him to the
Sanhedrin.
13 They also presented false witnesses
who said, "This man does not stop
speaking blasphemous words against
this holy place and the law.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6 – 7
34
14 For we heard him say that Jesus, this
Nazarene, will destroy this place and
change the customs that Moses handed
down to us."
15 And all who were si ng in the
Sanhedrin looked intently at him and
saw that his face was like the face of an
angel.
1 "Is this true?" the high priest asked.
2 "Brothers and fathers," he said,
"listen: The God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham when he was
in Mesopotamia, before he se led in
Haran,
3 and said to him: Get out of your
country and away from your rela ves,
and come to the land that I will show
you.
4 "Then he came out of the land of the
Chaldeans and se led in Haran. And
from there, a er his father died, God
7ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
35
had him move to this land in which you
now live.
5 He didn't give him an inheritance
in it, not even a foot of ground, but
He promised to give it to him as a
possession, and to his descendants a er
him, even though he was childless.
6 God spoke in this way: His descendants
would be strangers in a foreign country,
and they would enslave and oppress
them for 400 years.
7 I will judge the na on that they will
serve as slaves, God said. A er this, they
will come out and worship Me in this
place.
8 Then He gave him the covenant of
circumcision. This being so, he fathered
Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth
day; Isaac did the same with Jacob, and
Jacob with the 12 patriarchs.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
36
9 "The patriarchs became jealous of
Joseph and sold him into Egypt, but God
was with him
10 and rescued him out of all his
troubles. He gave him favor and wisdom
in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt,
who appointed him governor over Egypt
and over his whole household.
11 Then a famine came over all of Egypt
and Canaan, with great suﬀering, and
our forefathers could ﬁnd no food.
12 When Jacob heard there was grain in
Egypt, he sent our forefathers the ﬁrst
me.
13 The second me, Joseph was
revealed to his brothers, and Joseph's
family became known to Pharaoh.
14 Joseph then invited his father Jacob
and all his rela ves, 75 people in all,
15 and Jacob went down to Egypt. He
and our forefathers died there,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
37
16 were carried back to Shechem, and
were placed in the tomb that Abraham
had bought for a sum of silver from the
sons of Hamor in Shechem.
17 "As the me was drawing near to
fulﬁll the promise that God had made
to Abraham, the people ﬂourished and
mul plied in Egypt
18 un l a diﬀerent king ruled over Egypt
who did not know Joseph.
19 He dealt decei ully with our race and
oppressed our forefathers by making
them leave their infants outside so they
wouldn't survive.
20 At this me Moses was born, and he
was beau ful before God. He was nursed
in his father's home three months,
21 and when he was le outside,
Pharaoh's daughter adopted and raised
him as her own son.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
38
22 So Moses was educated in all the
wisdom of the Egyp ans, and was
powerful in his speech and ac ons.
23 "As he was approaching the age of
40, he decided to visit his brothers, the
sons of Israel.
24 When he saw one of them being
mistreated, he came to his rescue and
avenged the oppressed man by striking
down the Egyp an.
25 He assumed his brothers would
understand that God would give them
deliverance through him, but they did
not understand.
26 The next day he showed up while
they were ﬁgh ng and tried to reconcile
them peacefully, saying, 'Men, you are
brothers. Why are you mistrea ng each
other?'
27 "But the one who was mistrea ng his
neighbor pushed him away, saying: WhoACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
39
appointed you a ruler and a judge over
us?
28 Do you want to kill me, the same way
you killed the Egyp an yesterday?
29 "At this disclosure, Moses ﬂed and
became an exile in the land of Midian,
where he fathered two sons.
30 A er 40 years had passed, an angel
appeared to him in the desert of Mount
Sinai, in the ﬂame of a burning bush.
31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed
at the sight. As he was approaching to
look at it, the voice of the Lord came:
32 I am the God of your forefathers--the
God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.
So Moses began to tremble and did not
dare to look.
33 "Then the Lord said to him: Take the
sandals oﬀ your feet, because the place
where you are standing is holy ground.
34 I have certainly seen the oppression
of My people in Egypt; I have heard theirACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
40
groaning and have come down to rescue
them. And now, come, I will send you to
Egypt.
35 "This Moses, whom they rejected
when they said, Who appointed you a
ruler and a judge? --this one God sent as
a ruler and a redeemer by means of the
angel who appeared to him in the bush.
36 This man led them out and performed
wonders and signs in the land of Egypt,
at the Red Sea, and in the desert for 40
years.
37 "This is the Moses who said to the
sons of Israel, God will raise up for you
a Prophet like me from among your
brothers.
38 He is the one who was in the
congrega on in the desert together
with the angel who spoke to him on
Mount Sinai, and with our forefathers.
He received living oracles to give to us.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
41
39 Our forefathers were unwilling to
obey him, but pushed him away, and in
their hearts turned back to Egypt.
40 They told Aaron: Make us gods who
will go before us. As for this Moses who
brought us out of the land of Egypt, we
don't know what's become of him.
41 They even made a calf in those days,
oﬀered sacriﬁce to the idol, and were
celebra ng what their hands had made.
42 Then God turned away and gave
them up to worship the host of heaven,
as it is wri en in the book of the
prophets: Did you bring Me oﬀerings
and sacriﬁces for 40 years in the desert,
O house of Israel?
43 No, you took up the tent of Moloch
and the star of your god Rephan, the
images that you made to worship. So I
will deport you beyond Babylon!
44 "Our forefathers had the tabernacle
of the tes mony in the desert, just as HeACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
42
who spoke to Moses commanded him to
make it according to the pa ern he had
seen.
45 Our forefathers in turn received it
and with Joshua brought it in when they
dispossessed the na ons that God drove
out before our fathers, un l the days of
David.
46 He found favor in God's sight and
asked that he might provide a dwelling
place for the God of Jacob.
47 But it was Solomon who built Him a
house.
48 However, the Most High does not
dwell in sanctuaries made with hands,
as the prophet says:
49 Heaven is My throne, and earth My
footstool. What sort of house will you
build for Me? says the Lord, or what is
My res ng place?
50 Did not My hand make all these
things?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
51 "You s
43
ﬀ-necked people with
uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are
always resis ng the Holy Spirit; as your
forefathers did, so do you.
52 Which of the prophets did your
fathers not persecute? They even killed
those who announced beforehand the
coming of the Righteous One, whose
betrayers and murderers you have now
become.
53 You received the law under the
direc on of angels and yet have not kept
it."
54 When they heard these things,
they were enraged in their hearts and
gnashed their teeth at him.
55 But Stephen, ﬁlled by the Holy Spirit,
gazed into heaven. He saw God's glory,
with Jesus standing at the right hand of
God, and he said,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7 – 8
44
56 "Look! I see the heavens opened and
the Son of Man standing at the right
hand of God!"
57 Then they screamed at the top of
their voices, stopped their ears, and
rushed together against him.
58 They threw him out of the city and
began to stone him. And the witnesses
laid their robes at the feet of a young
man named Saul.
59 They were stoning Stephen as he
called out: "Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit!"
60 Then he knelt down and cried out
with a loud voice, "Lord, do not charge
them with this sin!" And saying this, he
fell asleep.
1 Saul agreed with pu ng him
to death. On that day a severe
persecu on broke out against the church
in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles
8ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
45
were sca ered throughout the land of
Judea and Samaria.
2 But devout men buried Stephen and
mourned deeply over him.
3 Saul, however, was ravaging the
church, and he would enter house a er
house, drag oﬀ men and women, and
put them in prison.
4 So those who were sca ered went on
their way proclaiming the message of
good news.
5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria
and preached the Messiah to them.
6 The crowds paid a en on with one
mind to what Philip said, as they heard
and saw the signs he was performing.
7 For unclean spirits, crying out with
a loud voice, came out of many who
were possessed, and many who were
paralyzed and lame were healed.
8 So there was great joy in that city.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
46
9 A man named Simon had previously
prac ced sorcery in that city and
astounded the Samaritan people, while
claiming to be somebody great.
10 They all paid a en on to him, from
the least of them to the greatest, and
they said, "This man is called the Great
Power of God!"
11 They were a en ve to him because
he had astounded them with his
sorceries for a long me.
12 But when they believed Philip, as
he proclaimed the good news about
the kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ, both men and women were
bap zed.
13 Then even Simon himself believed.
And a er he was bap zed, he went
around constantly with Philip and was
astounded as he observed the signs
and great miracles that were being
performed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
47
14 When the apostles who were at
Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
welcomed God's message, they sent
Peter and John to them.
15 A er they went down there, they
prayed for them, that they might receive
the Holy Spirit.
16 For He had not yet come down
on any of them; they had only been
bap zed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
17 Then Peter and John laid their hands
on them, and they received the Holy
Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit
was given through the laying on of the
apostles' hands, he oﬀered them money,
19 saying, "Give me this power too, so
that anyone I lay hands on may receive
the Holy Spirit."
20 But Peter told him, "May your
silver be destroyed with you, becauseACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
48
you thought the gi of God could be
obtained with money!
21 You have no part or share in this
ma er, because your heart is not right
before God.
22 Therefore repent of this wickedness
of yours, and pray to the Lord that the
intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
23 For I see you are poisoned by
bi erness and bound by iniquity."
24 "Please pray to the Lord for me,"
Simon replied, "so that nothing you have
said may happen to me."
25 Then, a er they had tes ﬁed and
spoken the message of the Lord, they
traveled back to Jerusalem, evangelizing
many villages of the Samaritans.
26 An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip:
"Get up and go south to the road that
goes down from Jerusalem to desert
Gaza."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
49
27 So he got up and went. There was an
Ethiopian man, a eunuch and high oﬃcial
of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians,
who was in charge of her en re treasury.
He had come to worship in Jerusalem
28 and was si ng in his chariot on his
way home, reading the prophet Isaiah
aloud.
29 The Spirit told Philip, "Go and join
that chariot."
30 When Philip ran up to it, he heard
him reading the prophet Isaiah, and
said, "Do you understand what you're
reading?"
31 "How can I," he said, "unless
someone guides me?" So he invited
Philip to come up and sit with him.
32 Now the Scripture passage he was
reading was this: He was led like a sheep
to the slaughter, and as a lamb is silent
before its shearer, so He does not open
His mouth.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
33 In His humilia
50
on jus ce was denied
Him. Who will describe His genera on?
For His life is taken from the earth.
34 The eunuch replied to Philip, "I ask
you, who is the prophet saying this
about--himself or another person?"
35 So Philip proceeded to tell him the
good news about Jesus, beginning from
that Scripture.
36 As they were traveling down the
road, they came to some water. The
eunuch said, "Look, there's water! What
would keep me from being bap zed?"
37 [And Philip said, "If you believe with
all your heart you may." And he replied,
"I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God."]
38 Then he ordered the chariot to stop,
and both Philip and the eunuch went
down into the water, and he bap zed
him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8 – 9
51
39 When they came up out of the water,
the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away,
and the eunuch did not see him any
longer. But he went on his way rejoicing.
40 Philip appeared in Azotus, and
passing through, he was evangelizing all
the towns un l he came to Caesarea.
1 Meanwhile Saul, s ll breathing
threats and murder against the
disciples of the Lord, went to the high
priest
2 and requested le ers from him to the
synagogues in Damascus, so that if he
found any who belonged to the Way,
either men or women, he might bring
them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
3 As he traveled and was nearing
Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly
ﬂashed around him.
4 Falling to the ground, he heard a voice
saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you
persecu ng Me?"
9ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
52
5 "Who are You, Lord?" he said. "I am
Jesus, whom you are persecu ng," He
replied.
6 "But get up and go into the city, and
you will be told what you must do."
7 The men who were traveling with him
stood speechless, hearing the sound but
seeing no one.
8 Then Saul got up from the ground,
and though his eyes were open, he could
see nothing. So they took him by the
hand and led him into Damascus.
9 He was unable to see for three days,
and did not eat or drink.
10 Now in Damascus there was a
disciple named Ananias. And the Lord
said to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Here
I am, Lord!" he said.
11 "Get up and go to the street called
Straight," the Lord said to him, "to the
house of Judas, and ask for a man fromACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
53
Tarsus named Saul, since he is praying
there.
12 In a vision he has seen a man named
Ananias coming in and placing his hands
on him so he may regain his sight."
13 "Lord," Ananias answered, "I have
heard from many people about this man,
how much harm he has done to Your
saints in Jerusalem.
14 And he has authority here from the
chief priests to arrest all who call on Your
name."
15 But the Lord said to him, "Go! For
this man is My chosen instrument to
carry My name before Gen les, kings,
and the sons of Israel.
16 I will certainly show him how much
he must suﬀer for My name!"
17 So Ananias le and entered the
house. Then he placed his hands on him
and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus,
who appeared to you on the road youACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
54
were traveling, has sent me so you may
regain your sight and be ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit."
18 At once something like scales fell
from his eyes, and he regained his sight.
Then he got up and was bap zed.
19 And a er taking some food, he
regained his strength. Saul was with the
disciples in Damascus for some days.
20 Immediately he began proclaiming
Jesus in the synagogues: "He is the Son
of God."
21 But all who heard him were
astounded and said, "Isn't this the man
who, in Jerusalem, was destroying those
who called on this name, and then came
here for the purpose of taking them as
prisoners to the chief priests?"
22 But Saul grew more capable, and
kept confounding the Jews who lived in
Damascus by proving that this One is the
Messiah.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
23 A
55
er many days had passed, the
Jews conspired to kill him,
24 but their plot became known to Saul.
So they were watching the gates day and
night intending to kill him,
25 but his disciples took him by night
and lowered him in a large basket
through an opening in the wall.
26 When he arrived in Jerusalem, he
tried to associate with the disciples, but
they were all afraid of him, since they
did not believe he was a disciple.
27 Barnabas, however, took him
and brought him to the apostles and
explained to them how, on the road,
Saul had seen the Lord, and that He had
talked to him, and how in Damascus he
had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.
28 Saul was coming and going with
them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in
the name of the Lord.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
56
29 He conversed and debated with the
Hellenis c Jews, but they a empted to
kill him.
30 When the brothers found out, they
took him down to Caesarea and sent him
oﬀ to Tarsus.
31 So the church throughout all Judea,
Galilee, and Samaria had peace, being
built up and walking in the fear of the
Lord and in the encouragement of the
Holy Spirit, and it increased in numbers.
32 As Peter was traveling from place to
place, he also came down to the saints
who lived in Lydda.
33 There he found a man named
Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had
been bedridden for eight years.
34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus
Christ heals you. Get up and make your
own bed," and immediately he got up.
35 So all who lived in Lydda and Sharon
saw him and turned to the Lord.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
57
36 In Joppa there was a disciple named
Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. She
was always doing good works and acts
of charity.
37 In those days she became sick and
died. A er washing her, they placed her
in a room upstairs.
38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the
disciples heard that Peter was there and
sent two men to him who begged him,
"Don't delay in coming with us."
39 So Peter got up and went with them.
When he arrived, they led him to the
room upstairs. And all the widows
approached him, weeping and showing
him the robes and clothes that Dorcas
had made while she was with them.
40 Then Peter sent them all out of
the room. He knelt down, prayed, and
turning toward the body said, "Tabitha,
get up!" She opened her eyes, saw Peter,
and sat up.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9 – 10
58
41 He gave her his hand and helped her
stand up. Then he called the saints and
widows and presented her alive.
42 This became known throughout all
Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
43 And Peter stayed on many days in
Joppa with Simon, a leather tanner.
1 There was a man in Caesarea
named Cornelius, a centurion of
what was called the Italian Regiment.
2 He was a devout man and feared God
along with his whole household. He did
many charitable deeds for the Jewish
people and always prayed to God.
3 At about three in the a ernoon he
dis nctly saw in a vision an angel of
God who came in and said to him,
"Cornelius!"
4 Looking intently at him, he became
afraid and said, "What is it, Lord?" And
he told him, "Your prayers and your acts
10ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
59
of charity have come up as a memorial
oﬀering before God.
5 Now send men to Joppa and call for
Simon, who is also named Peter.
6 He is lodging with Simon, a tanner,
whose house is by the sea."
7 When the angel who spoke to him
had gone, he called two of his household
slaves and a devout soldier, who was
one of those who a ended him.
8 A er explaining everything to them,
he sent them to Joppa.
9 The next day, as they were traveling
and nearing the city, Peter went up to
pray on the housetop at about noon.
10 Then he became hungry and wanted
to eat, but while they were preparing
something he went into a visionary
state.
11 He saw heaven opened and an object
coming down that resembled a largeACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
60
sheet being lowered to the earth by its
four corners.
12 In it were all the four-footed animals
and rep les of the earth, and the birds
of the sky.
13 Then a voice said to him, "Get up,
Peter; kill and eat!"
14 "No, Lord!" Peter said. "For I have
never eaten anything common and
unclean!"
15 Again, a second me, a voice said to
him, "What God has made clean, you
must not call common."
16 This happened three mes, and then
the object was taken up into heaven.
17 While Peter was deeply perplexed
about what the vision he had seen might
mean, the men who had been sent by
Cornelius, having asked direc ons to
Simon's house, stood at the gate.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
61
18 They called out, asking if Simon,
who was also named Peter, was lodging
there.
19 While Peter was thinking about the
vision, the Spirit told him, "Three men
are here looking for you.
20 Get up, go downstairs, and
accompany them with no doubts at all,
because I have sent them."
21 Then Peter went down to the men
and said, "Here I am, the one you're
looking for. What is the reason you're
here?"
22 They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an
upright and God-fearing man, who has a
good reputa on with the whole Jewish
na on, was divinely directed by a holy
angel to call you to his house and to hear
a message from you."
23 Peter then invited them in and gave
them lodging. The next day he got upACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
62
and set out with them, and some of the
brothers from Joppa went with him.
24 The following day he entered
Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expec ng
them and had called together his
rela ves and close friends.
25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met
him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.
26 But Peter helped him up and said,
"Stand up! I myself am also a man."
27 While talking with him, he went on in
and found that many had come together
there.
28 Peter said to them, "You know it's
forbidden for a Jewish man to associate
with or visit a foreigner. But God has
shown me that I must not call any person
common or unclean.
29 That's why I came without any
objec on when I was sent for. So I ask,
'Why did you send for me?'"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
63
30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago at
this hour, at three in the a ernoon, I was
praying in my house. Just then a man in
a dazzling robe stood before me
31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has
been heard, and your acts of charity
have been remembered in God's sight.
32 Therefore send someone to Joppa
and invite Simon here, who is also
named Peter. He is lodging in Simon the
tanner's house by the sea.'
33 Therefore I immediately sent for you,
and you did the right thing in coming. So
we are all present before God, to hear
everything you have been commanded
by the Lord."
34 Then Peter began to speak: "In truth,
I understand that God doesn't show
favori sm,
35 but in every na on the person who
fears Him and does righteousness is
acceptable to Him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
64
36 He sent the message to the sons of
Israel, proclaiming the good news of
peace through Jesus Christ--He is Lord of
all.
37 You know the events that took place
throughout all Judea, beginning from
Galilee a er the bap sm that John
preached:
38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
with the Holy Spirit and with power, and
how He went about doing good and
curing all who were under the tyranny of
the Devil, because God was with Him.
39 We ourselves are witnesses of
everything He did in both the Judean
country and in Jerusalem; yet they killed
Him by hanging Him on a tree.
40 God raised up this man on the third
day and permi ed Him to be seen,
41 not by all the people, but by us,
witnesses appointed beforehand byACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
65
God, who ate and drank with Him a er
He rose from the dead.
42 He commanded us to preach to the
people, and to solemnly tes fy that He
is the One appointed by God to be the
Judge of the living and the dead.
43 All the prophets tes fy about Him
that through His name everyone who
believes in Him will receive forgiveness
of sins."
44 While Peter was s ll speaking these
words, the Holy Spirit came down on all
those who heard the message.
45 The circumcised believers who
had come with Peter were astounded,
because the gi of the Holy Spirit had
been poured out on the Gen les also.
46 For they heard them speaking in
other languages and declaring the
greatness of God. Then Peter responded,
47 "Can anyone withhold water and
prevent these from being bap zed, whoACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10 – 11 66
have received the Holy Spirit just as we
have?"
48 And he commanded them to be
bap zed in the name of Jesus Christ.
Then they asked him to stay for a few
days.
1 The apostles and the brothers
who were throughout Judea
heard that the Gen les had welcomed
God's message also.
2 When Peter went up to Jerusalem,
those who stressed circumcision argued
with him,
3 saying, "You visited uncircumcised
men and ate with them!"
4 Peter began to explain to them in an
orderly sequence, saying:
5 "I was in the town of Joppa praying,
and I saw, in a visionary state, an object
coming down that resembled a large
sheet being lowered from heaven by its
four corners, and it came to me.
11ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11

6 When I looked closely and considered
it, I saw the four-footed animals of the
earth, the wild beasts, the rep les, and
the birds of the sky.
7 Then I also heard a voice telling me,
'Get up, Peter; kill and eat!'
8 "'No, Lord!' I said. 'For nothing
common or unclean has ever entered
my mouth!'
9 But a voice answered from heaven a
second me, 'What God has made clean,
you must not call common.'
10 "Now this happened three mes, and
then everything was drawn up again into
heaven.
11 At that very moment, three men who
had been sent to me from Caesarea
arrived at the house where we were.
12 Then the Spirit told me to go with
them with no doubts at all. These six
brothers accompanied me, and we went
into the man's house.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
68
13 He reported to us how he had seen
the angel standing in his house and
saying, 'Send to Joppa, and call for
Simon, who is also named Peter.
14 He will speak words to you by which
you and all your household will be
saved.'
15 "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit
came down on them, just as on us at the
beginning.
16 Then I remembered the word of the
Lord, how He said, 'John bap zed with
water, but you will be bap zed with the
Holy Spirit.'
17 Therefore, if God gave them the
same gi that He also gave to us when
we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,
how could I possibly hinder God?"
18 When they heard this they became
silent. Then they gloriﬁed God, saying,
"So God has granted repentance
resul ng in life to even the Gen les!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
19 Those who had been sca
69
ered as a
result of the persecu on that started
because of Stephen made their way as
far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and An och,
speaking the message to no one except
Jews.
20 But there were some of them,
Cypriot and Cyrenian men, who came
to An och and began speaking to the
Hellenists, proclaiming the good news
about the Lord Jesus.
21 The Lord's hand was with them, and
a large number who believed turned to
the Lord.
22 Then the report about them reached
the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and
they sent out Barnabas to travel as far as
An och.
23 When he arrived and saw the grace
of God, he was glad, and he encouraged
all of them to remain true to the Lord
with a ﬁrm resolve of the heart--ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
70
24 for he was a good man, full of
the Holy Spirit and of faith--and large
numbers of people were added to the
Lord.
25 Then he went to Tarsus to search for
Saul,
26 and when he found him he brought
him to An och. For a whole year they
met with the church and taught large
numbers, and the disciples were ﬁrst
called Chris ans in An och.
27 In those days some prophets came
down from Jerusalem to An och.
28 Then one of them, named Agabus,
stood up and predicted by the Spirit
that there would be a severe famine
throughout the Roman world. This took
place during the me of Claudius.
29 So each of the disciples, according to
his ability, determined to send relief to
the brothers who lived in Judea.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11 – 12 71
30 This they did, sending it to the elders
by means of Barnabas and Saul.
1 About that me King Herod
cruelly a acked some who
belonged to the church,
2 and he killed James, John's brother,
with the sword.
3 When he saw that it pleased the Jews,
he proceeded to arrest Peter too, during
the days of Unleavened Bread.
4 A er the arrest, he put him in prison
and assigned four squads of four soldiers
each to guard him, intending to bring
him out to the people a er the Passover.
5 So Peter was kept in prison, but prayer
was being made earnestly to God for
him by the church.
6 On the night before Herod was to
bring him out for execu on , Peter was
sleeping between two soldiers, bound
with two chains, while the sentries in
front of the door guarded the prison.
12ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
72
7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord
appeared, and a light shone in the cell.
Striking Peter on the side, he woke him
up and said, "Quick, get up!" Then the
chains fell oﬀ his wrists.
8 "Get dressed," the angel told him,
"and put on your sandals." And he did
so. "Wrap your cloak around you," he
told him, "and follow me."
9 So he went out and followed, and
he did not know that what took place
through the angel was real, but thought
he was seeing a vision.
10 A er they passed the ﬁrst and second
guard posts, they came to the iron gate
that leads into the city, which opened to
them by itself. They went outside and
passed one street, and immediately the
angel le him.
11 Then Peter came to himself and
said, "Now I know for certain that the
Lord has sent His angel and rescued meACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
73
from Herod's grasp and from all that the
Jewish people expected."
12 When he realized this, he went to
the house of Mary, the mother of John
Mark, where many had assembled and
were praying.
13 He knocked at the door in the
gateway, and a servant named Rhoda
came to answer.
14 She recognized Peter's voice, and
because of her joy she did not open the
gate, but ran in and announced that
Peter was standing at the gateway.
15 "You're crazy!" they told her. But she
kept insis ng that it was true. Then they
said, "It's his angel!"
16 Peter, however, kept on knocking,
and when they opened the door and
saw him, they were astounded.
17 Mo oning to them with his hand to
be silent, he explained to them how the
Lord had brought him out of the prison.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
74
"Report these things to James and the
brothers," he said. Then he departed
and went to a diﬀerent place.
18 At daylight, there was a great
commo on among the soldiers as to
what could have become of Peter.
19 A er Herod had searched and did
not ﬁnd him, he interrogated the guards
and ordered their execu on. Then Herod
went down from Judea to Caesarea and
stayed there.
20 He had been very angry with the
Tyrians and Sidonians. Together they
presented themselves before him, and
having won over Blastus, who was in
charge of the king's bedroom, they
asked for peace, because their country
was supplied with food from the king's
country.
21 So on an appointed day, dressed in
royal robes and seated on the throne,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12 – 13 75
Herod delivered a public address to
them.
22 The populace began to shout, "It's
the voice of a god and not of a man!"
23 At once an angel of the Lord struck
him because he did not give the glory
to God, and he became infected with
worms and died.
24 Then God's message ﬂourished and
mul plied.
25 And Barnabas and Saul returned to
Jerusalem a er they had completed
their relief mission, on which they took
John Mark.
1 In the local church at An och
there were prophets and
teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was
called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian,
Manaen, a close friend of Herod the
tetrarch, and Saul.
2 As they were ministering to the Lord
and fas ng, the Holy Spirit said, "Set
13ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
76
apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the
work that I have called them to."
3 Then, a er they had fasted, prayed,
and laid hands on them, they sent them
oﬀ.
4 Being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they
came down to Seleucia, and from there
they sailed to Cyprus.
5 Arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed
God's message in the Jewish synagogues.
They also had John as their assistant.
6 When they had gone through the
whole island as far as Paphos, they came
across a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet
named Bar-Jesus.
7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius
Paulus, an intelligent man. This man
summoned Barnabas and Saul and
desired to hear God's message.
8 But Elymas, the sorcerer, which is how
his name is translated, opposed themACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
77
and tried to turn the proconsul away
from the faith.
9 Then Saul--also called Paul--ﬁlled with
the Holy Spirit, stared straight at the
sorcerer
10 and said, "You son of the Devil, full
of all deceit and all fraud, enemy of
all righteousness! Won't you ever stop
perver ng the straight paths of the
Lord?
11 Now, look! The Lord's hand is against
you: you are going to be blind, and will
not see the sun for a me." Suddenly a
mist and darkness fell on him, and he
went around seeking someone to lead
him by the hand.
12 Then the proconsul, seeing what
happened, believed and was astonished
at the teaching about the Lord.
13 Paul and his companions set sail from
Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
78
John, however, le them and went back
to Jerusalem.
14 They con nued their journey from
Perga and reached An och in Pisidia.
On the Sabbath day they went into the
synagogue and sat down.
15 A er the reading of the Law and the
Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue
sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if
you have any message of encouragement
for the people, you can speak."
16 Then standing up, Paul mo oned
with his hand and spoke: "Men of Israel,
and you who fear God, listen!
17 The God of this people Israel chose
our forefathers, exalted the people
during their stay in the land of Egypt,
and led them out of it with a mighty arm.
18 And for about 40 years He put up
with them in the desert;ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
19 then a
79
er destroying seven na ons
in the land of Canaan, He gave their land
to them as an inheritance.
20 This all took about 450 years. A er
this, He gave them judges un l Samuel
the prophet.
21 Then they asked for a king, so God
gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of
the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years.
22 A er removing him, He raised up
David as their king, of whom He tes ﬁed:
'I have found David the son of Jesse, a
man a er My heart, who will carry out
all My will.'
23 "From this man's descendants,
according to the promise, God brought
the Savior, Jesus, to Israel.
24 Before He came to public a en on,
John had previously proclaimed a
bap sm of repentance to all the people
of Israel.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
25 Then as John was comple
80
ng his life
work, he said, 'Who do you think I am?
I am not the One. But look! Someone is
coming a er me, and I am not worthy to
un e the sandals on His feet.'
26 "Brothers, sons of Abraham's race,
and those among you who fear God, the
message of this salva on has been sent
to us.
27 For the residents of Jerusalem and
their rulers, since they did not recognize
Him or the voices of the prophets that
are read every Sabbath, have fulﬁlled
their words by condemning Him.
28 Though they found no grounds for
the death penalty, they asked Pilate to
have Him killed.
29 When they had fulﬁlled all that had
been wri en about Him, they took Him
down from the tree and put Him in a
tomb.
30 But God raised Him from the dead,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
81
31 and He appeared for many days
to those who came up with Him from
Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His
witnesses to the people.
32 And we ourselves proclaim to you
the good news of the promise that was
made to our forefathers.
33 God has fulﬁlled this to us their
children by raising up Jesus, as it is
wri en in the second Psalm: You are My
Son; today I have become Your Father.
34 Since He raised Him from the dead,
never to return to decay, He has spoken
in this way, I will grant you the faithful
covenant blessings made to David.
35 Therefore He also says in another
passage, You will not allow Your Holy
One to see decay.
36 For David, a er serving his own
genera on in God's plan, fell asleep, was
buried with his fathers, and decayed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
82
37 But the One whom God raised up did
not decay.
38 Therefore, let it be known to
you, brothers, that through this man
forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed
to you,
39 and everyone who believes in Him
is jus ﬁed from everything, which you
could not be jus ﬁed from through the
law of Moses.
40 So beware that what is said in the
prophets does not happen to you:
41 Look, you scoﬀers, marvel and vanish
away, because I am doing a work in your
days, a work that you will never believe,
even if someone were to explain it to
you. "
42 As they were leaving, they begged
that these ma ers be presented to them
the following Sabbath.
43 A er the synagogue had been
dismissed, many of the Jews and devoutACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
83
proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas,
who were speaking with them and
persuading them to con nue in the
grace of God.
44 The following Sabbath almost the
whole town assembled to hear the
message of the Lord.
45 But when the Jews saw the crowds,
they were ﬁlled with jealousy and began
to oppose what Paul was saying by
insul ng him.
46 Then Paul and Barnabas boldly said:
"It was necessary that God's message be
spoken to you ﬁrst. But since you reject
it, and consider yourselves unworthy of
eternal life, we now turn to the Gen les!
47 For this is what the Lord has
commanded us: I have appointed you as
a light for the Gen les, to bring salva on
to the ends of the earth. "
48 When the Gen les heard this, they
rejoiced and gloriﬁed the message of theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13 – 14 84
Lord, and all who had been appointed to
eternal life believed.
49 So the message of the Lord spread
through the whole region.
50 But the Jews incited the religious
women of high standing and the
leading men of the city. They s rred up
persecu on against Paul and Barnabas
and expelled them from their district.
51 But shaking the dust oﬀ their
feet against them, they proceeded to
Iconium.
52 And the disciples were ﬁlled with joy
and the Holy Spirit.
1 The same thing happened in
Iconium; they entered the Jewish
synagogue and spoke in such a way that
a great number of both Jews and Greeks
believed.
2 But the Jews who refused to believe
s rred up and poisoned the minds of the
Gen les against the brothers.
14ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
3 So they stayed there for some
85
me
and spoke boldly, in reliance on the Lord,
who tes ﬁed to the message of His grace
by gran ng that signs and wonders be
performed through them.
4 But the people of the city were
divided, some siding with the Jews and
some with the apostles.
5 When an a empt was made by both
the Gen les and Jews, with their rulers,
to assault and stone them,
6 they found out about it and ﬂed to the
Lycaonian towns called Lystra and Derbe,
and to the surrounding countryside.
7 And there they kept evangelizing.
8 In Lystra a man without strength in
his feet, lame from birth, and who had
never walked, sat
9 and heard Paul speaking. A er
observing him closely and seeing that he
had faith to be healed,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
86
10 Paul said in a loud voice, "Stand up
straight on your feet!" And he jumped
up and started to walk around.
11 When the crowds saw what Paul had
done, they raised their voices, saying in
the Lycaonian language, "The gods have
come down to us in the form of men!"
12 And they started to call Barnabas,
Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was
the main speaker.
13 Then the priest of Zeus, whose
temple was just outside the town,
brought oxen and garlands to the gates.
He, with the crowds, intended to oﬀer
sacriﬁce.
14 The apostles Barnabas and Paul tore
their robes when they heard this and
rushed into the crowd, shou ng:
15 "Men! Why are you doing these
things? We are men also, with the same
nature as you, and we are proclaiming
good news to you, that you should turnACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
87
from these worthless things to the living
God, who made the heaven, the earth,
the sea, and everything in them .
16 In past genera ons He allowed all
the na ons to go their own way,
17 although He did not leave Himself
without a witness, since He did good:
giving you rain from heaven and frui ul
seasons, and sa sfying your hearts with
food and happiness."
18 Even though they said these things,
they barely stopped the crowds from
sacriﬁcing to them.
19 Then some Jews came from An och
and Iconium, and when they had won
over the crowds and stoned Paul, they
dragged him out of the city, thinking he
was dead.
20 A er the disciples surrounded him,
he got up and went into the town. The
next day he le with Barnabas for Derbe.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
21 A
88
er they had evangelized that town
and made many disciples, they returned
to Lystra, to Iconium, and to An och,
22 strengthening the hearts of the
disciples by encouraging them to
con nue in the faith, and by telling
them, "It is necessary to pass through
many troubles on our way into the
kingdom of God."
23 When they had appointed elders in
every church and prayed with fas ng,
they commi ed them to the Lord in
whom they had believed.
24 Then they passed through Pisidia and
came to Pamphylia.
25 A er they spoke the message in
Perga, they went down to A alia.
26 From there they sailed back to
An och where they had been entrusted
to the grace of God for the work they
had completed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14 – 15 89
27 A
er they arrived and gathered
the church together, they reported
everything God had done with them,
and that He had opened the door of
faith to the Gen les.
28 And they spent a considerable me
with the disciples.
1 Some men came down from
Judea and began to teach the
brothers: "Unless you are circumcised
according to the custom prescribed by
Moses, you cannot be saved!"
2 But a er Paul and Barnabas had
engaged them in serious argument
and debate, they arranged for Paul and
Barnabas and some others of them
to go up to the apostles and elders in
Jerusalem concerning this controversy.
3 When they had been sent on their
way by the church, they passed through
both Phoenicia and Samaria, explaining
in detail the conversion of the Gen les,
15ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
90
and they created great joy among all the
brothers.
4 When they arrived at Jerusalem,
they were welcomed by the church,
the apostles, and the elders, and they
reported all that God had done with
them.
5 But some of the believers from the
party of the Pharisees stood up and said,
"It is necessary to circumcise them and
to command them to keep the law of
Moses!"
6 Then the apostles and the elders
assembled to consider this ma er.
7 A er there had been much debate,
Peter stood up and said to them:
"Brothers, you are aware that in the
early days God made a choice among
you, that by my mouth the Gen les
would hear the gospel message and
believe.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
91
8 And God, who knows the heart,
tes ﬁed to them by giving the Holy
Spirit, just as He also did to us.
9 He made no dis nc on between us
and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
10 Why, then, are you now tes ng God
by pu ng on the disciples' necks a yoke
that neither our forefathers nor we have
been able to bear?
11 On the contrary, we believe we are
saved through the grace of the Lord
Jesus, in the same way they are."
12 Then the whole assembly fell silent
and listened to Barnabas and Paul
describing all the signs and wonders
God had done through them among the
Gen les.
13 A er they stopped speaking, James
responded: "Brothers, listen to me!
14 Simeon has reported how God ﬁrst
intervened to take from the Gen les a
people for His name.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
92
15 And the words of the prophets agree
with this, as it is wri en:
16 A er these things I will return and
will rebuild David's tent, which has fallen
down. I will rebuild its ruins and will set
it up again,
17 so that those who are le of mankind
may seek the Lord--even all the Gen les
who are called by My name, says the
Lord who does these things,
18 which have been known from long
ago.
19 Therefore, in my judgment, we
should not cause diﬃcul es for those
who turn to God from among the
Gen les,
20 but instead we should write to them
to abstain from things polluted by idols,
from sexual immorality, from ea ng
anything that has been strangled, and
from blood.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
21 For since ancient
93
mes, Moses has
had in every city those who proclaim
him, and he is read aloud in the
synagogues every Sabbath day."
22 Then the apostles and the elders,
with the whole church, decided to select
men from among them and to send
them to An och with Paul and Barnabas:
Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, both
leading men among the brothers.
23 They wrote this le er to be delivered
by them: From the apostles and the
elders, your brothers, To the brothers
from among the Gen les in An och,
Syria, and Cilicia: Gree ngs.
24 Because we have heard that some to
whom we gave no authoriza on went
out from us and troubled you with their
words and unse led your hearts,
25 we have unanimously decided to
select men and send them to you along
with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
94
26 who have risked their lives for the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27 Therefore we have sent Judas and
Silas, who will personally report the
same things by word of mouth.
28 For it was the Holy Spirit's decision-
-and ours--to put no greater burden on
you than these necessary things:
29 that you abstain from food oﬀered to
idols, from blood, from ea ng anything
that has been strangled, and from sexual
immorality. If you keep yourselves from
these things, you will do well. Farewell.
30 Then, being sent oﬀ, they went down
to An och, and a er gathering the
assembly, they delivered the le er.
31 When they read it, they rejoiced
because of its encouragement.
32 Both Judas and Silas, who were also
prophets themselves, encouraged the
brothers and strengthened them with a
long message.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
95
33 A
er spending some me there, they
were sent back in peace by the brothers
to those who had sent them.
34
35 But Paul and Barnabas, along with
many others, remained in An och
teaching and proclaiming the message
of the Lord.
36 A er some me had passed, Paul
said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit
the brothers in every town where we
have preached the message of the Lord,
and see how they're doing."
37 Barnabas wanted to take along John
Mark.
38 But Paul did not think it appropriate
to take along this man who had deserted
them in Pamphylia and had not gone on
with them to the work.
39 There was such a sharp disagreement
that they parted company, and BarnabasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15 – 16 96
took Mark with him and sailed oﬀ to
Cyprus.
40 Then Paul chose Silas and departed,
a er being commended to the grace of
the Lord by the brothers.
41 He traveled through Syria and Cilicia,
strengthening the churches.
1 Then he went on to Derbe and
Lystra, where there was a disciple
named Timothy, the son of a believing
Jewish woman, but his father was a
Greek.
2 The brothers at Lystra and Iconium
spoke highly of him.
3 Paul wanted Timothy to go with him,
so he took him and circumcised him
because of the Jews who were in those
places, since they all knew that his father
was a Greek.
4 As they traveled through the towns,
they delivered the decisions reached by
16ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
97
the apostles and elders at Jerusalem for
them to observe.
5 So the churches were strengthened in
the faith and were increased in number
daily.
6 They went through the region of
Phrygia and Gala a and were prevented
by the Holy Spirit from speaking the
message in the province of Asia.
7 When they came to Mysia, they tried
to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus
did not allow them.
8 So, bypassing Mysia, they came down
to Troas.
9 During the night a vision appeared to
Paul: a Macedonian man was standing
and pleading with him, "Cross over to
Macedonia and help us!"
10 A er he had seen the vision, we
immediately made eﬀorts to set out for
Macedonia, concluding that God had
called us to evangelize them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
11 Then, se
98
ng sail from Troas, we ran
a straight course to Samothrace, the
next day to Neapolis,
12 and from there to Philippi, a Roman
colony, which is a leading city of that
district of Macedonia. We stayed in that
city for a number of days.
13 On the Sabbath day we went outside
the city gate by the river, where we
thought there was a place of prayer.
We sat down and spoke to the women
gathered there.
14 A woman named Lydia, a dealer in
purple cloth from the city of Thya ra,
who worshiped God, was listening. The
Lord opened her heart to pay a en on
to what was spoken by Paul.
15 A er she and her household were
bap zed, she urged us, "If you consider
me a believer in the Lord, come and stay
at my house." And she persuaded us.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
99
16 Once, as we were on our way to
prayer, a slave girl met us who had a
spirit of predic on and made a large
proﬁt for her owners by fortune-telling.
17 As she followed Paul and us she cried
out, "These men are the slaves of the
Most High God, who are proclaiming to
you the way of salva on."
18 And she did this for many days. But
Paul was greatly aggravated, and turning
to the spirit, said, "I command you in
the name of Jesus Christ to come out of
her!" And it came out right away.
19 When her owners saw that their
hope of proﬁt was gone, they seized
Paul and Silas and dragged them into the
marketplace to the authori es.
20 And bringing them before the chief
magistrates, they said, "These men are
seriously disturbing our city. They are
Jews,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
21 and are promo
100
ng customs that are
not legal for us as Romans to adopt or
prac ce."
22 Then the mob joined in the a ack
against them, and the chief magistrates
stripped oﬀ their clothes and ordered
them to be beaten with rods.
23 A er they had inﬂicted many blows
on them, they threw them in jail,
ordering the jailer to keep them securely
guarded.
24 Receiving such an order, he put them
into the inner prison and secured their
feet in the stocks.
25 About midnight Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns to God, and
the prisoners were listening to them.
26 Suddenly there was such a violent
earthquake that the founda ons of the
jail were shaken, and immediately all
the doors were opened, and everyone's
chains came loose.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
101
27 When the jailer woke up and saw the
doors of the prison open, he drew his
sword and was going to kill himself, since
he thought the prisoners had escaped.
28 But Paul called out in a loud voice,
"Don't harm yourself, because all of us
are here!"
29 Then the jailer called for lights,
rushed in, and fell down trembling
before Paul and Silas.
30 Then he escorted them out and said,
"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
31 So they said, "Believe on the Lord
Jesus, and you will be saved--you and
your household."
32 Then they spoke the message of the
Lord to him along with everyone in his
house.
33 He took them the same hour of the
night and washed their wounds. Right
away he and all his family were bap zed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
102
34 He brought them up into his house,
set a meal before them, and rejoiced
because he had believed God with his
en re household.
35 When daylight came, the chief
magistrates sent the police to say,
"Release those men!"
36 The jailer reported these words to
Paul: "The magistrates have sent orders
for you to be released. So come out now
and go in peace."
37 But Paul said to them, "They beat us
in public without a trial, although we are
Roman ci zens, and threw us in jail. And
now are they going to smuggle us out
secretly? Certainly not! On the contrary,
let them come themselves and escort us
out!"
38 Then the police reported these words
to the magistrates. And they were afraid
when they heard that Paul and Silas
were Roman ci zens.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16 – 17 103
39 So they came and apologized to
them, and escor ng them out, they
urged them to leave town.
40 A er leaving the jail, they came
to Lydia's house where they saw and
encouraged the brothers, and departed.
1 Then they traveled through
Amphipolis and Apollonia and
came to Thessalonica, where there was
a Jewish synagogue.
2 As usual, Paul went to them, and on
three Sabbath days reasoned with them
from the Scriptures,
3 explaining and showing that the
Messiah had to suﬀer and rise from the
dead, and saying: "This is the Messiah,
Jesus, whom I am proclaiming to you."
4 Then some of them were persuaded
and joined Paul and Silas, including a
great number of God-fearing Greeks, as
well as a number of the leading women.
17ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
104
5 But the Jews became jealous, and
when they had brought together some
scoundrels from the marketplace and
formed a mob, they set the city in an
uproar. A acking Jason's house, they
searched for them to bring them out to
the public assembly.
6 When they did not ﬁnd them, they
dragged Jason and some of the brothers
before the city oﬃcials, shou ng, "These
men who have turned the world upside
down have come here too,
7 and Jason has received them as
guests! They are all ac ng contrary to
Caesar's decrees, saying that there is
another king--Jesus!"
8 The Jews s rred up the crowd and the
city oﬃcials who heard these things.
9 So taking a security bond from Jason
and the others, they released them.
10 As soon as it was night, the brothers
sent Paul and Silas oﬀ to Beroea. OnACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
105
arrival, they went into the synagogue of
the Jews.
11 The people here were more open-
minded than those in Thessalonica,
since they welcomed the message with
eagerness and examined the Scriptures
daily to see if these things were so.
12 Consequently, many of them
believed, including a number of the
prominent Greek women as well as men.
13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica
found out that God's message had been
proclaimed by Paul at Beroea, they came
there too, agita ng and disturbing the
crowds.
14 Then the brothers immediately sent
Paul away to go to the sea, but Silas and
Timothy stayed on there.
15 Those who escorted Paul brought
him as far as Athens, and a er receiving
instruc ons for Silas and Timothy toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
106
come to him as quickly as possible, they
departed.
16 While Paul was wai ng for them in
Athens, his spirit was troubled within
him when he saw that the city was full of
idols.
17 So he reasoned in the synagogue
with the Jews and with those who
worshiped God, and in the marketplace
every day with those who happened to
be there.
18 Then also, some of the Epicurean
and Stoic philosophers argued with
him. Some said, "What is this pseudo-
intellectual trying to say?" Others
replied, "He seems to be a preacher of
foreign dei es"--because he was telling
the good news about Jesus and the
resurrec on.
19 They took him and brought him to
the Areopagus, and said, "May we learnACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
107
about this new teaching you're speaking
of?
20 For what you say sounds strange to
us, and we want to know what these
ideas mean."
21 Now all the Athenians and the
foreigners residing there spent their
me on nothing else but telling or
hearing something new.
22 Then Paul stood in the middle of the
Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I
see that you are extremely religious in
every respect.
23 For as I was passing through
and observing the objects of your
worship, I even found an altar on
which was inscribed: TO AN UNKNOWN
GOD Therefore, what you worship in
ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
24 The God who made the world and
everything in it--He is Lord of heavenACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
108
and earth and does not live in shrines
made by hands.
25 Neither is He served by human
hands, as though He needed anything,
since He Himself gives everyone life and
breath and all things.
26 From one man He has made every
na on of men to live all over the earth
and has determined their appointed
mes and the boundaries of where they
live,
27 so that they might seek God, and
perhaps they might reach out and ﬁnd
Him, though He is not far from each one
of us.
28 For in Him we live and move and
exist, as even some of your own poets
have said, 'For we are also His oﬀspring.'
29 Being God's oﬀspring, then, we
shouldn't think that the divine nature
is like gold or silver or stone, an image
fashioned by human art and imagina on.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17 – 18 109
30 "Therefore, having overlooked the
mes of ignorance, God now commands
all people everywhere to repent,
31 because He has set a day on which
He is going to judge the world in
righteousness by the Man He has
appointed. He has provided proof of
this to everyone by raising Him from the
dead."
32 When they heard about resurrec on
of the dead, some began to ridicule him.
But others said, "We will hear you about
this again."
33 So Paul went out from their presence.
34 However, some men joined him and
believed, among whom were Dionysius
the Areopagite, a woman named
Damaris, and others with them.
1 A er this, he le from Athens
and went to Corinth,
2 where he found a Jewish man named
Aquila, a na ve of Pontus, who had
18ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
110
recently come from Italy with his wife
Priscilla because Claudius had ordered
all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul came to
them,
3 and being of the same occupa on,
stayed with them and worked, for they
were tentmakers by trade.
4 He reasoned in the synagogue every
Sabbath and tried to persuade both Jews
and Greeks.
5 When Silas and Timothy came down
from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with
preaching the message and solemnly
tes ﬁed to the Jews that the Messiah is
Jesus.
6 But when they resisted and
blasphemed, he shook out his clothes
and told them, "Your blood is on your
own heads! I am clean. From now on I
will go to the Gen les."
7 So he le there and went to the
house of a man named Ti us Justus,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
111
a worshiper of God, whose house was
next door to the synagogue.
8 Crispus, the leader of the synagogue,
believed the Lord, along with his whole
household; and many of the Corinthians,
when they heard, believed and were
bap zed.
9 Then the Lord said to Paul in a night
vision, "Don't be afraid, but keep on
speaking and don't be silent.
10 For I am with you, and no one will
lay a hand on you to hurt you, because I
have many people in this city."
11 And he stayed there a year and
six months, teaching the word of God
among them.
12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,
the Jews made a united a ack against
Paul and brought him to the judge's
bench.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
112
13 "This man," they said, "persuades
people to worship God contrary to the
law!"
14 And as Paul was about to open his
mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were
a ma er of a crime or of moral evil, it
would be reasonable for me to put up
with you Jews.
15 But if these are ques ons about
words, names, and your own law, see to
it yourselves. I don't want to be a judge
of such things."
16 So he drove them from the judge's
bench.
17 Then they all seized Sosthenes, the
leader of the synagogue, and beat him in
front of the judge's bench. But none of
these things concerned Gallio.
18 So Paul, having stayed on for many
days, said good-bye to the brothers and
sailed away to Syria. Priscilla and AquilaACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
113
were with him. He shaved his head at
Cenchreae, because he had taken a vow.
19 When they reached Ephesus he le
them there, but he himself entered the
synagogue and engaged in discussion
with the Jews.
20 And though they asked him to stay
for a longer me, he declined,
21 but said good-bye and stated, "I'll
come back to you again, if God wills."
Then he set sail from Ephesus.
22 On landing at Caesarea, he went up
and greeted the church, and went down
to An och.
23 He set out, traveling through one
place a er another in the Gala an
territory and Phrygia, strengthening all
the disciples.
24 A Jew named Apollos, a na ve
Alexandrian, an eloquent man who was
powerful in the Scriptures, arrived in
Ephesus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18 – 19 114
25 This man had been instructed in the
way of the Lord; and being fervent in
spirit, he spoke and taught the things
about Jesus accurately, although he
knew only John's bap sm.
26 He began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. A er Priscilla and Aquila
heard him, they took him home and
explained the way of God to him more
accurately.
27 When he wanted to cross over
to Achaia, the brothers wrote to the
disciples urging them to welcome him.
A er he arrived, he greatly helped those
who had believed through grace.
28 For he vigorously refuted the Jews
in public, demonstra ng through the
Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.
1 While Apollos was in Corinth,
Paul traveled through the interior
regions and came to Ephesus. He found
some disciples
19ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
115
2 and asked them, "Did you receive the
Holy Spirit when you believed?" "No,"
they told him, "we haven't even heard
that there is a Holy Spirit."
3 "Then with what bap sm were you
bap zed?" he asked them. "With John's
bap sm," they replied.
4 Paul said, "John bap zed with a
bap sm of repentance, telling the
people that they should believe in the
One who would come a er him, that is,
in Jesus."
5 On hearing this, they were bap zed in
the name of the Lord Jesus.
6 And when Paul had laid his hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came on them,
and they began to speak with other
languages and to prophesy.
7 Now there were about 12 men in all.
8 Then he entered the synagogue and
spoke boldly over a period of three
months, engaging in discussion andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
116
trying to persuade them about the
things related to the kingdom of God.
9 But when some became hardened
and would not believe, slandering the
Way in front of the crowd, he withdrew
from them and met separately with the
disciples, conduc ng discussions every
day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
10 And this went on for two years, so
that all the inhabitants of the province
of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the
word of the Lord.
11 God was performing extraordinary
miracles by Paul's hands,
12 so that even facecloths or work
aprons that had touched his skin were
brought to the sick, and the diseases le
them, and the evil spirits came out of
them.
13 Then some of the i nerant Jewish
exorcists a empted to pronounce the
name of the Lord Jesus over those whoACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
117
had evil spirits, saying, "I command you
by the Jesus whom Paul preaches!"
14 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief
priest, were doing this.
15 The evil spirit answered them, "Jesus
I know, and Paul I recognize--but who
are you?"
16 Then the man who had the evil spirit
leaped on them, overpowered them
all, and prevailed against them, so that
they ran out of that house naked and
wounded.
17 This became known to everyone who
lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks.
Then fear fell on all of them, and the
name of the Lord Jesus was magniﬁed.
18 And many who had become believers
came confessing and disclosing their
prac ces,
19 while many of those who had
prac ced magic collected their books
and burned them in front of everyone.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
118
So they calculated their value, and found
it to be 50,000 pieces of silver.
20 In this way the Lord's message
ﬂourished and prevailed.
21 When these events were over, Paul
resolved in the Spirit to pass through
Macedonia and Achaia and go to
Jerusalem. "A er I've been there," he
said, "I must see Rome as well!"
22 So a er sending two of those who
assisted him, Timothy and Erastus, to
Macedonia, he himself stayed in the
province of Asia for a while.
23 During that me there was a major
disturbance about the Way.
24 For a person named Demetrius, a
silversmith who made silver shrines
of Artemis, provided a great deal of
business for the cra smen.
25 When he had assembled them, as
well as the workers engaged in this type
of business, he said: "Men, you knowACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
119
that our prosperity is derived from this
business.
26 You both see and hear that not only
in Ephesus, but in almost the whole
province of Asia, this man Paul has
persuaded and misled a considerable
number of people by saying that gods
made by hand are not gods!
27 So not only do we run a risk that our
business may be discredited, but also
that the temple of the great goddess
Artemis may be despised and her
magniﬁcence come to the verge of
ruin--the very one whom the whole
province of Asia and the world adore."
28 When they had heard this, they were
ﬁlled with rage and began to cry out,
"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
29 So the city was ﬁlled with confusion;
and they rushed all together into the
amphitheater, dragging along Gaius andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
120
Aristarchus, Macedonians who were
Paul's traveling companions.
30 Though Paul wanted to go in before
the people, the disciples did not let him.
31 Even some of the provincial oﬃcials
of Asia, who were his friends, sent word
to him, pleading with him not to take a
chance by going into the amphitheater.
32 Meanwhile, some were shou ng one
thing and some another, because the
assembly was in confusion, and most of
them did not know why they had come
together.
33 Then some of the crowd gave
Alexander advice when the Jews pushed
him to the front. So mo oning with his
hand, Alexander wanted to make his
defense to the people.
34 But when they recognized that he
was a Jew, a united cry went up from all
of them for about two hours: "Great is
Artemis of the Ephesians!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
121
35 However, when the city clerk had
calmed the crowd down, he said,
"Men of Ephesus! What man is there
who doesn't know that the city of the
Ephesians is the temple guardian of the
great Artemis, and of the image that fell
from heaven?
36 Therefore, since these things are
undeniable, you must keep calm and not
do anything rash.
37 For you have brought these men
here who are not temple robbers or
blasphemers of our goddess.
38 So if Demetrius and the cra smen
who are with him have a case against
anyone, the courts are in session, and
there are proconsuls. Let them bring
charges against one another.
39 But if you want something else, it
must be decided in a legal assembly.
40 In fact, we run a risk of being charged
with rio ng for what happened today,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19 – 20 122
since there is no jus ﬁca on that we
can give as a reason for this disorderly
gathering."
41 A er saying this, he dismissed the
assembly.
1 A er the uproar was over, Paul
sent for the disciples, encouraged
them, and a er saying good-bye,
departed to go to Macedonia.
2 And when he had passed through
those areas and exhorted them at
length, he came to Greece
3 and stayed three months. When he
was about to set sail for Syria, a plot was
devised against him by the Jews, so a
decision was made to go back through
Macedonia.
4 He was accompanied by Sopater, son
of Pyrrhus, from Beroea, Aristarchus
and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius
from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and
Trophimus from Asia.
20ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
123
5 These men went on ahead and waited
for us in Troas,
6 but we sailed away from Philippi a er
the days of Unleavened Bread. In ﬁve
days we reached them at Troas, where
we spent seven days.
7 On the ﬁrst day of the week, we
assembled to break bread. Paul spoke to
them, and since he was about to depart
the next day, he extended his message
un l midnight.
8 There were many lamps in the room
upstairs where we were assembled,
9 and a young man named Eutychus
was si ng on a window sill and sank into
a deep sleep as Paul kept on speaking.
When he was overcome by sleep he
fell down from the third story, and was
picked up dead.
10 But Paul went down, threw himself
on him, embraced him, and said, "Don't
be alarmed, for his life is in him!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
11 A
124
er going upstairs, breaking the
bread, and ea ng, he conversed a
considerable me un l dawn. Then he
le .
12 They brought the boy home alive and
were greatly comforted.
13 Then we went on ahead to the
ship and sailed for Assos, from there
intending to take Paul on board. For
these were his instruc ons, since he
himself was going by land.
14 When he met us at Assos, we took
him on board and came to Mitylene.
15 Sailing from there, the next day we
arrived oﬀ Chios. The following day we
crossed over to Samos, and the day a er,
we came to Miletus.
16 For Paul had decided to sail past
Ephesus so he would not have to spend
me in the province of Asia, because
he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if
possible, for the day of Pentecost.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
125
17 Now from Miletus, he sent to
Ephesus and called for the elders of the
church.
18 And when they came to him, he said
to them: "You know, from the ﬁrst day I
set foot in Asia, how I was with you the
whole me--
19 serving the Lord with all humility,
with tears, and with the trials that came
to me through the plots of the Jews--
20 and that I did not shrink back from
proclaiming to you anything that was
proﬁtable, or from teaching it to you in
public and from house to house.
21 I tes ﬁed to both Jews and Greeks
about repentance toward God and faith
in our Lord Jesus.
22 "And now I am on my way to
Jerusalem, bound in my spirit, not
knowing what I will encounter there,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
23 except that in town a
126
er town the
Holy Spirit tes ﬁes to me that chains
and aﬄic ons are wai ng for me.
24 But I count my life of no value to
myself, so that I may ﬁnish my course
and the ministry I received from the Lord
Jesus, to tes fy to the gospel of God's
grace.
25 "And now I know that none of you,
among whom I went about preaching
the kingdom, will ever see my face again.
26 Therefore I tes fy to you this day that
I am innocent of everyone's blood,
27 for I did not shrink back from
declaring to you the whole plan of God.
28 Be on guard for yourselves and for
all the ﬂock, among whom the Holy
Spirit has appointed you as overseers, to
shepherd the church of God, which He
purchased with His own blood.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
29 I know that a
127
er my departure
savage wolves will come in among you,
not sparing the ﬂock.
30 And men from among yourselves will
rise up with deviant doctrines to lure the
disciples into following them.
31 Therefore be on the alert,
remembering that night and day
for three years I did not stop warning
each one of you with tears.
32 "And now I commit you to God and
to the message of His grace, which
is able to build you up and to give
you an inheritance among all who are
sanc ﬁed.
33 I have not coveted anyone's silver or
gold or clothing.
34 You yourselves know that these
hands have provided for my needs, and
for those who were with me.
35 In every way I've shown you that by
laboring like this, it is necessary to helpACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20 – 21 128
the weak and to keep in mind the words
of the Lord Jesus, for He said, 'It is more
blessed to give than to receive.'"
36 A er he said this, he knelt down and
prayed with all of them.
37 There was a great deal of weeping
by everyone. And embracing Paul, they
kissed him,
38 grieving most of all over his
statement that they would never see his
face again. Then they escorted him to
the ship.
1 A er we tore ourselves away
from them and set sail, we came
by a direct route to Cos, the next day to
Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
2 Finding a ship crossing over to
Phoenicia, we boarded and set sail.
3 A er we sighted Cyprus, leaving it on
the le , we sailed on to Syria and arrived
at Tyre, because the ship was to unload
its cargo there.
21ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
129
4 So we found some disciples and
stayed there seven days. They said to
Paul through the Spirit not to go to
Jerusalem.
5 When our days there were over, we
le to con nue our journey, while all
of them, with their wives and children,
escorted us out of the city. A er kneeling
down on the beach to pray,
6 we said good-bye to one another.
Then we boarded the ship, and they
returned home.
7 When we completed our voyage from
Tyre, we reached Ptolemais, where we
greeted the brothers and stayed with
them one day.
8 The next day we le and came to
Caesarea, where we entered the house
of Philip the evangelist, who was one of
the Seven, and stayed with him.
9 This man had four virgin daughters
who prophesied.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
130
10 While we were staying there many
days, a prophet named Agabus came
down from Judea.
11 He came to us, took Paul's belt, ed
his own feet and hands, and said, "This
is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this way
the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man
who owns this belt, and deliver him into
Gen le hands.'"
12 When we heard this, both we and
the local people begged him not to go
up to Jerusalem.
13 Then Paul replied, "What are you
doing, weeping and breaking my heart?
For I am ready not only to be bound, but
also to die in Jerusalem for the name of
the Lord Jesus."
14 Since he would not be persuaded,
we stopped talking and simply said, "The
Lord's will be done!"
15 A er these days we got ready and
went up to Jerusalem.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
131
16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea
also went with us and brought us to
Mnason, a Cypriot and an early disciple,
with whom we were to stay.
17 When we reached Jerusalem, the
brothers welcomed us gladly.
18 The following day Paul went in with
us to James, and all the elders were
present.
19 A er gree ng them, he related one
by one what God did among the Gen les
through his ministry.
20 When they heard it, they gloriﬁed
God and said, "You see, brother, how
many thousands of Jews there are who
have believed, and they are all zealous
for the law.
21 But they have been told about you
that you teach all the Jews who are
among the Gen les to abandon Moses,
by telling them not to circumcise their
children or to walk in our customs.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
132
22 So what is to be done? They will
certainly hear that you've come.
23 Therefore do what we tell you: We
have four men who have obligated
themselves with a vow.
24 Take these men, purify yourself along
with them, and pay for them to get
their heads shaved. Then everyone will
know that what they were told about
you amounts to nothing, but that you
yourself are also careful about observing
the law.
25 With regard to the Gen les who
have believed, we have wri en a le er
containing our decision that they should
keep themselves from food sacriﬁced to
idols, from blood, from what is strangled,
and from sexual immorality."
26 Then the next day, Paul took the men,
having puriﬁed himself along with them,
and entered the temple, announcing
the comple on of the puriﬁca on daysACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
133
when the oﬀering for each of them
would be made.
27 As the seven days were about to end,
the Jews from the province of Asia saw
him in the temple complex, s rred up
the whole crowd, and seized him,
28 shou ng, "Men of Israel, help!
This is the man who teaches everyone
everywhere against our people, our law,
and this place. What's more, he also
brought Greeks into the temple and has
profaned this holy place."
29 For they had previously seen
Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with
him, and they supposed that Paul had
brought him into the temple complex.
30 The whole city was s rred up, and
the people rushed together. They seized
Paul, dragged him out of the temple
complex, and at once the gates were
shut.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
134
31 As they were trying to kill him, word
went up to the commander of the
regiment that all Jerusalem was in chaos.
32 Taking along soldiers and centurions,
he immediately ran down to them.
Seeing the commander and the soldiers,
they stopped bea ng Paul.
33 Then the commander came up, took
him into custody, and ordered him to be
bound with two chains. He asked who
he was and what he had done.
34 Some in the mob were shou ng
one thing and some another. Since he
was not able to get reliable informa on
because of the uproar, he ordered him
to be taken into the barracks.
35 When Paul got to the steps, he had
to be carried by the soldiers because of
the mob's violence,
36 for the mass of people were following
and yelling, "Kill him!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21 – 22 135
37 As he was about to be brought
into the barracks, Paul said to the
commander, "Am I allowed to say
something to you?" He replied, "Do you
know Greek?
38 Aren't you the Egyp an who raised a
rebellion some me ago and led 4,000
Assassins into the desert?"
39 Paul said, "I am a Jewish man from
Tarsus of Cilicia, a ci zen of an important
city. Now I ask you, let me speak to the
people."
40 A er he had given permission, Paul
stood on the steps and mo oned with
his hand to the people. When there was
a great hush, he addressed them in the
Hebrew language:
1 "Brothers and fathers, listen
now to my defense before you."
2 When they heard that he was
addressing them in the Hebrew
language, they became even quieter.
22ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
3 He con
136
nued, "I am a Jewish man,
born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up
in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and
educated according to the strict view of
our patriarchal law. Being zealous for
God, just as all of you are today,
4 I persecuted this Way to the death,
binding and pu ng both men and
women in jail,
5 as both the high priest and the whole
council of elders can tes fy about me.
Having received le ers from them to the
brothers, I was traveling to Damascus to
bring those who were prisoners there to
be punished in Jerusalem.
6 "As I was traveling and near Damascus,
about noon an intense light from heaven
suddenly ﬂashed around me.
7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice
saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you
persecu ng Me?'ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
137
8 "I answered, 'Who are You, Lord?' "He
said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene,
whom you are persecu ng!'
9 Now those who were with me saw the
light, but they did not hear the voice of
the One who was speaking to me.
10 "Then I said, 'What should I do, Lord?'
"And the Lord told me, 'Get up and go
into Damascus, and there you will be
told about everything that is assigned
for you to do.'
11 "Since I couldn't see because of the
brightness of that light, I was led by the
hand by those who were with me, and
came into Damascus.
12 Someone named Ananias, a devout
man according to the law, having a good
reputa on with all the Jews residing
there,
13 came to me, stood by me, and said,
'Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And in
that very hour I looked up and saw him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
138
14 Then he said, 'The God of our fathers
has appointed you to know His will, to
see the Righteous One, and to hear the
sound of His voice.
15 For you will be a witness for Him to
all people of what you have seen and
heard.
16 And now, why delay? Get up and be
bap zed, and wash away your sins by
calling on His name.'
17 "A er I came back to Jerusalem and
was praying in the temple complex, I
went into a visionary state
18 and saw Him telling me, 'Hurry and
get out of Jerusalem quickly, because
they will not accept your tes mony
about Me!'
19 "But I said, 'Lord, they know that in
synagogue a er synagogue I had those
who believed in You imprisoned and
beaten.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
139
20 And when the blood of Your witness
Stephen was being shed, I myself
was standing by and approving, and I
guarded the clothes of those who killed
him.'
21 "Then He said to me, 'Go, because I
will send you far away to the Gen les.'"
22 They listened to him up to this word.
Then they raised their voices, shou ng,
"Wipe this person oﬀ the earth--it's a
disgrace for him to live!"
23 As they were yelling and ﬂinging
aside their robes and throwing dust into
the air,
24 the commander ordered him to be
brought into the barracks, direc ng that
he be examined with the scourge, so
he could discover the reason they were
shou ng against him like this.
25 As they stretched him out for the
lash, Paul said to the centurion standing
by, "Is it legal for you to scourge aACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
140
man who is a Roman ci zen and is
uncondemned?"
26 When the centurion heard this, he
went and reported to the commander,
saying, "What are you going to do? For
this man is a Roman ci zen."
27 The commander came and said to
him, "Tell me--are you a Roman ci zen?"
"Yes," he said.
28 The commander replied, "I bought
this ci zenship for a large amount
of money." "But I myself was born a
ci zen," Paul said.
29 Therefore, those who were about
to examine him withdrew from him at
once. The commander too was alarmed
when he realized Paul was a Roman
ci zen and he had bound him.
30 The next day, since he wanted to
ﬁnd out exactly why Paul was being
accused by the Jews, he released him
and instructed the chief priests andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
141
all the Sanhedrin to convene. Then he
brought Paul down and placed him
before them.
1 Paul looked intently at the
Sanhedrin and said, "Brothers, I
have lived my life before God in all good
conscience un l this day."
2 But the high priest Ananias ordered
those who were standing next to him to
strike him on the mouth.
3 Then Paul said to him, "God is going
to strike you, you whitewashed wall! You
are si ng there judging me according to
the law, and in viola on of the law are
you ordering me to be struck?"
4 And those standing nearby said, "Do
you dare revile God's high priest?"
5 "I did not know, brothers," Paul said,
"that it was the high priest. For it is
wri en, You must not speak evil of a
ruler of your people. "
23ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
142
6 When Paul realized that one part of
them were Sadducees and the other
part were Pharisees, he cried out in the
Sanhedrin, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee,
a son of Pharisees! I am being judged
because of the hope of the resurrec on
of the dead!"
7 When he said this, a dispute broke
out between the Pharisees and the
Sadducees, and the assembly was
divided.
8 For the Sadducees say there is no
resurrec on, and no angel or spirit, but
the Pharisees aﬃrm them all.
9 The shou ng grew loud, and some of
the scribes of the Pharisees' party got
up and argued vehemently: "We ﬁnd
nothing evil in this man. What if a spirit
or an angel has spoken to him?"
10 When the dispute became violent,
the commander feared that Paul might
be torn apart by them and ordered theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
143
troops to go down, rescue him from
them, and bring him into the barracks.
11 The following night, the Lord stood by
him and said, "Have courage! For as you
have tes ﬁed about Me in Jerusalem, so
you must also tes fy in Rome."
12 When it was day, the Jews formed a
conspiracy and bound themselves under
a curse: neither to eat nor to drink un l
they had killed Paul.
13 There were more than 40 who had
formed this plot.
14 These men went to the chief priests
and elders and said, "We have bound
ourselves under a solemn curse that we
won't eat anything un l we have killed
Paul.
15 So now you, along with the
Sanhedrin, make a request to the
commander that he bring him down to
you as if you were going to inves gate
his case more thoroughly. However,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
144
before he gets near, we are ready to kill
him."
16 But the son of Paul's sister, hearing
about their ambush, came and entered
the barracks and reported it to Paul.
17 Then Paul called one of the
centurions and said, "Take this young
man to the commander, because he has
something to report to him."
18 So he took him, brought him to the
commander, and said, "The prisoner
Paul called me and asked me to bring
this young man to you, because he has
something to tell you."
19 Then the commander took him by
the hand, led him aside, and inquired
privately, "What is it you have to report
to me?"
20 "The Jews," he said, "have agreed
to ask you to bring Paul down to the
Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they areACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
145
going to hold a somewhat more careful
inquiry about him.
21 Don't let them persuade you,
because there are more than 40 of them
arranging to ambush him, men who have
bound themselves under a curse not to
eat or drink un l they kill him. Now they
are ready, wai ng for a commitment
from you."
22 So the commander dismissed the
young man and instructed him, "Don't
tell anyone that you have informed me
about this."
23 He summoned two of his centurions
and said, "Get 200 soldiers ready with
70 cavalry and 200 spearmen to go to
Caesarea at nine tonight.
24 Also provide mounts so they can put
Paul on them and bring him safely to
Felix the governor."
25 He wrote a le er of this kind:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
146
26 Claudius Lysias, To the most excellent
governor Felix: Gree ngs.
27 When this man had been seized by
the Jews and was about to be killed
by them, I arrived with my troops and
rescued him because I learned that he is
a Roman ci zen.
28 Wan ng to know the charge for
which they were accusing him, I brought
him down before their Sanhedrin.
29 I found out that the accusa ons were
about disputed ma ers in their law, and
that there was no charge that merited
death or chains.
30 When I was informed that there was
a plot against the man, I sent him to you
right away. I also ordered his accusers
to state their case against him in your
presence.
31 Therefore, during the night, the
soldiers took Paul and brought him to
An patris as they were ordered.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23 – 24 147
32 The next day, they returned to the
barracks, allowing the cavalry to go on
with him.
33 When these men entered Caesarea
and delivered the le er to the governor,
they also presented Paul to him.
34 A er he read it, he asked what
province he was from. So when he
learned he was from Cilicia,
35 he said, "I will give you a hearing
whenever your accusers get here too."
And he ordered that he be kept under
guard in Herod's palace.
1 A er ﬁve days Ananias the high
priest came down with some
elders and a lawyer named Tertullus.
These men presented their case against
Paul to the governor.
2 When he was called in, Tertullus
began to accuse him and said: "Since we
enjoy great peace because of you, and
24ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
148
reforms are taking place for the beneﬁt
of this na on by your foresight,
3 we gratefully receive them always and
in all places, most excellent Felix, with all
thankfulness.
4 However, so that I will not burden
you any further, I beg you in your
graciousness to give us a brief hearing.
5 For we have found this man to be a
plague, an agitator among all the Jews
throughout the Roman world, and a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes!
6 He even tried to desecrate the temple,
so we apprehended him [and wanted to
judge him according to our law.
7 But Lysias the commander came and
took him from our hands, commanding
his accusers to come to you.]
8 By examining him yourself you will be
able to discern all these things of which
we accuse him."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
9 The Jews also joined in the a
149
ack,
alleging that these things were so.
10 When the governor mo oned to him
to speak, Paul replied: "Because I know
you have been a judge of this na on
for many years, I am glad to oﬀer my
defense in what concerns me.
11 You are able to determine that it is
no more than 12 days since I went up to
worship in Jerusalem.
12 And they didn't ﬁnd me dispu ng
with anyone or causing a disturbance
among the crowd, either in the temple
complex or in the synagogues, or
anywhere in the city.
13 Neither can they provide evidence to
you of what they now bring against me.
14 But I confess this to you: that
according to the Way, which they call
a sect, so I worship my fathers' God,
believing all the things that are wri en
in the Law and in the Prophets.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
150
15 And I have a hope in God, which
these men themselves also accept, that
there is going to be a resurrec on, both
of the righteous and the unrighteous.
16 I always do my best to have a clear
conscience toward God and men.
17 A er many years, I came to bring
charitable gi s and oﬀerings to my
na on,
18 and while I was doing this, some
Jews from the province of Asia found me
ritually puriﬁed in the temple, without a
crowd and without any uproar.
19 It is they who ought to be here
before you to bring charges, if they have
anything against me.
20 Either let these men here state what
wrongdoing they found in me when I
stood before the Sanhedrin,
21 or about this one statement I cried
out while standing among them, 'Today IACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
151
am being judged before you concerning
the resurrec on of the dead.'"
22 Since Felix was accurately informed
about the Way, he adjourned the
hearing, saying, "When Lysias the
commander comes down, I will decide
your case."
23 He ordered that the centurion keep
Paul under guard, though he could have
some freedom, and that he should not
prevent any of his friends from serving
him.
24 A er some days, when Felix came
with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish,
he sent for Paul and listened to him on
the subject of faith in Christ Jesus.
25 Now as he spoke about
righteousness, self-control, and
the judgment to come, Felix became
afraid and replied, "Leave for now, but
when I ﬁnd me I'll call for you."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24 – 25 152
26 At the same
me he was also hoping
that money would be given to him by
Paul. For this reason he sent for him
quite o en and conversed with him.
27 A er two years had passed, Felix
received a successor, Porcius Festus, and
because he wished to do a favor for the
Jews, Felix le Paul in prison.
1 Three days a er Festus arrived
in the province, he went up to
Jerusalem from Caesarea.
2 Then the chief priests and the leaders
of the Jews presented their case against
Paul to him; and they appealed,
3 asking him to do them a favor against
Paul, that he might summon him to
Jerusalem. They were preparing an
ambush along the road to kill him.
4 However, Festus answered that Paul
should be kept at Caesarea, and that he
himself was about to go there shortly.
25ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
153
5 "Therefore," he said, "let the men of
authority among you go down with me
and accuse him, if there is any wrong in
this man."
6 When he had spent not more than
eight or 10 days among them, he went
down to Caesarea. The next day, seated
at the judge's bench, he commanded
Paul to be brought in.
7 When he arrived, the Jews who
had come down from Jerusalem stood
around him and brought many serious
charges that they were not able to prove,
8 while Paul made the defense that,
"Neither against the Jewish law, nor
against the temple, nor against Caesar
have I sinned at all."
9 Then Festus, wan ng to do a favor
for the Jews, replied to Paul, "Are you
willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be
tried before me on these charges?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
154
10 But Paul said: "I am standing at
Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be
tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews,
as even you can see very well.
11 If then I am doing wrong, or have
done anything deserving of death, I do
not refuse to die, but if there is nothing
to what these men accuse me of, no
one can give me up to them. I appeal to
Caesar!"
12 A er Festus conferred with his
council, he replied, "You have appealed
to Caesar; to Caesar you will go!"
13 A er some days had passed, King
Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea
and paid a courtesy call on Festus.
14 Since they stayed there many days,
Festus presented Paul's case to the king,
saying, "There's a man who was le as a
prisoner by Felix.
15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief
priests and the elders of the JewsACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
155
presented their case and asked for a
judgment against him.
16 I answered them that it's not the
Romans' custom to give any man
up before the accused confronts
the accusers face to face and has an
opportunity to give a defense concerning
the charge.
17 Therefore, when they had assembled
here, I did not delay. The next day I sat at
the judge's bench and ordered the man
to be brought in.
18 Concerning him, the accusers stood
up and brought no charge of the sort I
was expec ng.
19 Instead they had some
disagreements with him about
their own religion and about a certain
Jesus, a dead man whom Paul claimed
to be alive.
20 Since I was at a loss in a dispute over
such things, I asked him if he wishedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
156
to go to Jerusalem and be tried there
concerning these ma ers.
21 But when Paul appealed to be held
for trial by the Emperor, I ordered him to
be kept in custody un l I could send him
to Caesar."
22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I
would like to hear the man myself."
"Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear
him."
23 So the next day, Agrippa and Bernice
came with great pomp and entered the
auditorium with the commanders and
prominent men of the city. When Festus
gave the command, Paul was brought in.
24 Then Festus said: "King Agrippa and
all men present with us, you see this
man about whom the whole Jewish
community has appealed to me, both
in Jerusalem and here, shou ng that he
should not live any longer.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25 – 26 157
25 Now I realized that he had not done
anything deserving of death, but when
he himself appealed to the Emperor, I
decided to send him.
26 I have nothing deﬁnite to write to
the Emperor about him. Therefore, I
have brought him before all of you, and
especially before you, King Agrippa, so
that a er this examina on is over, I may
have something to write.
27 For it seems unreasonable to me to
send a prisoner and not to indicate the
charges against him."
1 Agrippa said to Paul, "It is
permi ed for you to speak for
yourself." Then Paul stretched out his
hand and began his defense:
2 "I consider myself fortunate, King
Agrippa, that today I am going to make
a defense before you about everything I
am accused of by the Jews,
26ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
158
3 especially since you are an expert in all
the Jewish customs and controversies.
Therefore I beg you to listen to me
pa ently.
4 "All the Jews know my way of life from
my youth, which was spent from the
beginning among my own na on and in
Jerusalem.
5 They had previously known me for
quite some me, if they were willing to
tes fy, that according to the strictest
party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.
6 And now I stand on trial for the hope
of the promise made by God to our
fathers,
7 the promise our 12 tribes hope to
a ain as they earnestly serve Him night
and day. Because of this hope I am being
accused by the Jews, O king!
8 Why is it considered incredible by any
of you that God raises the dead?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
159
9 In fact, I myself supposed it was
necessary to do many things in
opposi on to the name of Jesus the
Nazarene.
10 This I actually did in Jerusalem, and
I locked up many of the saints in prison,
since I had received authority for that
from the chief priests. When they were
put to death, I cast my vote against
them.
11 In all the synagogues I o en tried
to make them blaspheme by punishing
them. Being greatly enraged at them, I
even pursued them to foreign ci es.
12 "Under these circumstances I was
traveling to Damascus with authority
and a commission from the chief priests.
13 At midday, while on the road, O king,
I saw a light from heaven brighter than
the sun, shining around me and those
traveling with me.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
160
14 When we had all fallen to the ground,
I heard a voice speaking to me in the
Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are
you persecu ng Me? It is hard for you to
kick against the goads.'
15 "But I said, 'Who are You, Lord?' "And
the Lord replied: 'I am Jesus, whom you
are persecu ng.
16 But get up and stand on your feet.
For I have appeared to you for this
purpose, to appoint you as a servant and
a witness of things you have seen, and
of things in which I will appear to you.
17 I will rescue you from the people and
from the Gen les, to whom I now send
you,
18 to open their eyes that they may
turn from darkness to light and from the
power of Satan to God, that they may
receive forgiveness of sins and a share
among those who are sanc ﬁed by faith
in Me.'ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
161
19 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not
disobedient to the heavenly vision.
20 Instead, I preached to those
in Damascus ﬁrst, and to those in
Jerusalem and in all the region of Judea,
and to the Gen les, that they should
repent and turn to God, and do works
worthy of repentance.
21 For this reason the Jews seized me in
the temple complex and were trying to
kill me.
22 Since I have obtained help that
comes from God, to this day I stand and
tes fy to both small and great, saying
nothing else than what the prophets and
Moses said would take place--
23 that the Messiah must suﬀer, and
that as the ﬁrst to rise from the dead, He
would proclaim light to our people and
to the Gen les."
24 As he was making his defense this
way, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
162
"You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much
study is driving you mad!"
25 But Paul replied, "I'm not out of my
mind, most excellent Festus. On the
contrary, I'm speaking words of truth
and good judgment.
26 For the king knows about these
ma ers. It is to him I am actually
speaking boldly. For I'm not convinced
that any of these things escapes his
no ce, since this was not done in a
corner!
27 King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know you believe."
28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Are you
going to persuade me to become a
Chris an so easily?"
29 "I wish before God," replied Paul,
"that whether easily or with diﬃculty,
not only you but all who listen to me
today might become as I am--except for
these chains."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26 – 27 163
30 So the king, the governor, Bernice,
and those si ng with them got up,
31 and when they had le they talked
with each other and said, "This man is
doing nothing that deserves death or
chains."
32 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "This
man could have been released if he had
not appealed to Caesar."
1 When it was decided that we
were to sail to Italy, they handed
over Paul and some other prisoners to a
centurion named Julius, of the Imperial
Regiment.
2 So when we had boarded a ship of
Adramy um, we put to sea, intending
to sail to ports along the coast of
the province of Asia. Aristarchus, a
Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with
us.
3 The next day we put in at Sidon, and
Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed
27ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
164
him to go to his friends to receive their
care.
4 When we had put out to sea from
there, we sailed along the northern
coast of Cyprus because the winds were
against us.
5 A er sailing through the open sea oﬀ
Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra
in Lycia.
6 There the centurion found an
Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put
us on board.
7 Sailing slowly for many days, we came
with diﬃculty as far as Cnidus. But since
the wind did not allow us to approach it,
we sailed along the south side of Crete
oﬀ Salmone.
8 With yet more diﬃculty we sailed
along the coast, and came to a place
called Fair Havens near the city of Lasea.
9 By now much me had passed, and
the voyage was already dangerous. SinceACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
165
the Fast was already over, Paul gave his
advice
10 and told them, "Men, I can see that
this voyage is headed toward damage
and heavy loss, not only of the cargo and
the ship, but also of our lives."
11 But the centurion paid a en on to
the captain and the owner of the ship
rather than to what Paul said.
12 Since the harbor was unsuitable to
winter in, the majority decided to set sail
from there, hoping somehow to reach
Phoenix, a harbor on Crete open to the
southwest and northwest, and to winter
there.
13 When a gentle south wind sprang
up, they thought they had achieved
their purpose; they weighed anchor and
sailed along the shore of Crete.
14 But not long a erwards, a ﬁerce wind
called the "northeaster" rushed down
from the island.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
166
15 Since the ship was caught and was
unable to head into the wind, we gave
way to it and were driven along.
16 A er running under the shelter of a
li le island called Cauda, we were barely
able to get control of the skiﬀ.
17 A er hois ng it up, they used ropes
and tackle and girded the ship. Then,
fearing they would run aground on the
Syr s, they lowered the dri -anchor, and
in this way they were driven along.
18 Because we were being severely
ba ered by the storm, they began to
je son the cargo the next day.
19 On the third day, they threw the
ship's gear overboard with their own
hands.
20 For many days neither sun nor stars
appeared, and the severe storm kept
raging; ﬁnally all hope that we would be
saved was disappearing.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
167
21 Since many were going without food,
Paul stood up among them and said,
"You men should have followed my
advice not to sail from Crete and sustain
this damage and loss.
22 Now I urge you to take courage,
because there will be no loss of any of
your lives, but only of the ship.
23 For this night an angel of the God I
belong to and serve stood by me,
24 saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul. You
must stand before Caesar. And, look!
God has graciously given you all those
who are sailing with you.'
25 Therefore, take courage, men,
because I believe God that it will be just
the way it was told to me.
26 However, we must run aground on a
certain island."
27 When the fourteenth night came,
we were dri ing in the Adria c Sea, andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
168
in the middle of the night the sailors
thought they were approaching land.
28 They took a sounding and found it to
be 120 feet deep; when they had sailed
a li le farther and sounded again, they
found it to be 90 feet deep.
29 Then, fearing we might run aground
in some rocky place, they dropped four
anchors from the stern and prayed for
daylight to come.
30 Some sailors tried to escape from the
ship; they had let down the skiﬀ into the
sea, pretending that they were going to
put out anchors from the bow.
31 Paul said to the centurion and the
soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the
ship, you cannot be saved."
32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes
holding the skiﬀ and let it drop away.
33 When it was just about daylight,
Paul urged them all to take food, saying,
"Today is the fourteenth day that youACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
169
have been wai ng and going without
food, having eaten nothing.
34 Therefore I urge you to take some
food. For this has to do with your
survival, since not a hair will be lost from
the head of any of you."
35 A er he said these things and had
taken some bread, he gave thanks to
God in the presence of them all, and
when he had broken it, he began to eat.
36 They all became encouraged and
took food themselves.
37 In all there were 276 of us on the
ship.
38 And having eaten enough food, they
began to lighten the ship by throwing
the grain overboard into the sea.
39 When daylight came, they did not
recognize the land, but sighted a bay
with a beach. They planned to run the
ship ashore if they could.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
40 A
170
er cas ng oﬀ the anchors, they
le them in the sea, at the same me
loosening the ropes that held the
rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail
to the wind and headed for the beach.
41 But they struck a sandbar and ran
the ship aground. The bow jammed fast
and remained immovable, but the stern
began to break up with the pounding of
the waves.
42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the
prisoners so that no one could swim oﬀ
and escape.
43 But the centurion kept them from
carrying out their plan because he
wanted to save Paul, so he ordered those
who could swim to jump overboard ﬁrst
and get to land.
44 The rest were to follow, some on
planks and some on debris from the
ship. In this way, all got safely to land.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28

1 Safely ashore, we then learned
that the island was called Malta.
2 The local people showed us
extraordinary kindness, for they lit a ﬁre
and took us all in, since rain was falling
and it was cold.
3 As Paul gathered a bundle of
brushwood and put it on the ﬁre, a
viper came out because of the heat and
fastened itself to his hand.
4 When the local people saw the
creature hanging from his hand, they
said to one another, "This man is
probably a murderer, and though he has
escaped the sea, Jus ce does not allow
him to live!"
5 However, he shook the creature oﬀ
into the ﬁre and suﬀered no harm.
6 They expected that he would swell up
or suddenly drop dead. But a er they
waited a long me and saw nothingACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
172
unusual happen to him, they changed
their minds and said he was a god.
7 Now in the area around that place
was an estate belonging to the leading
man of the island, named Publius,
who welcomed us and entertained us
hospitably for three days.
8 It happened that Publius' father was in
bed suﬀering from fever and dysentery.
Paul went to him, and praying and laying
his hands on him, he healed him.
9 A er this, the rest of those on the
island who had diseases also came and
were cured.
10 So they heaped many honors on us,
and when we sailed, they gave us what
we needed.
11 A er three months we set sail in an
Alexandrian ship that had wintered at
the island, with the Twin Brothers as its
ﬁgurehead.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
12 Pu
173
ng in at Syracuse, we stayed
three days.
13 From there, a er making a circuit
along the coast, we reached Rhegium.
A er one day a south wind sprang up,
and the second day we came to Puteoli.
14 There we found believers and were
invited to stay with them for seven days.
And so we came to Rome.
15 Now the believers from there had
heard the news about us and had come
to meet us as far as Forum of Appius and
Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he
thanked God and took courage.
16 And when we entered Rome, Paul
was permi ed to stay by himself with
the soldier who guarded him.
17 A er three days he called together
the leaders of the Jews. And when
they had gathered he said to them:
"Brothers, although I have done nothing
against our people or the customs of ourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
174
forefathers, I was delivered as a prisoner
from Jerusalem into the hands of the
Romans
18 who, a er examining me, wanted to
release me, since I had not commi ed a
capital oﬀense.
19 Because the Jews objected, I was
compelled to appeal to Caesar; it was
not as though I had any accusa on
against my na on.
20 So, for this reason I've asked to see
you and speak to you. In fact, it is for
the hope of Israel that I'm wearing this
chain."
21 And they said to him, "We haven't
received any le ers about you from
Judea; none of the brothers has come
and reported or spoken anything evil
about you.
22 But we consider it suitable to hear
from you what you think. For concerningACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
175
this sect, we are aware that it is spoken
against everywhere."
23 A er arranging a day with him, many
came to him at his lodging. From dawn to
dusk he expounded and witnessed about
the kingdom of God. He persuaded them
concerning Jesus from both the Law of
Moses and the Prophets.
24 Some were persuaded by what he
said, but others did not believe.
25 Disagreeing among themselves, they
began to leave a er Paul made one
statement: "The Holy Spirit correctly
spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your
forefathers
26 when He said, Go to this people and
say: 'You will listen and listen, yet never
understand; and you will look and look,
yet never perceive.
27 For this people's heart has grown
callous, their ears are hard of hearing,
and they have shut their eyes; otherwiseACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
176
they might see with their eyes and hear
with their ears, understand with their
heart, and be converted--and I would
heal them.'
28 Therefore, let it be known to you that
this saving work of God has been sent to
the Gen les; they will listen!"
29 [A er he said these things, the Jews
departed, while engaging in a prolonged
debate among themselves.]
30 Then he stayed two whole years in
his own rented house. And he welcomed
all who visited him,
31 proclaiming the kingdom of God
and teaching the things concerning the
Lord Jesus Christ with full boldness and
without hindrance.Romans
1
1 Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called
as an apostle and singled out for
God's good news--
2 which He promised long ago through
His prophets in the Holy Scriptures--
3 concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our
Lord, who was a descendant of David
according to the ﬂesh
4 and was established as the powerful
Son of God by the resurrec on from the
dead according to the Spirit of holiness.
5 We have received grace and
apostleship through Him to bring about
the obedience of faith among all the
na ons, on behalf of His name,
6 including yourselves who are also
Jesus Christ's by calling:ROMANS 1
2
7 To all who are in Rome, loved by God,
called as saints. Grace to you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
8 First, I thank my God through Jesus
Christ for all of you because the news
of your faith is being reported in all the
world.
9 For God, whom I serve with my spirit
in telling the good news about His Son,
is my witness that I constantly men on
you,
10 always asking in my prayers that if it
is somehow in God's will, I may now at
last succeed in coming to you.
11 For I want very much to see you, that
I may impart to you some spiritual gi to
strengthen you,
12 that is, to be mutually encouraged by
each other's faith, both yours and mine.
13 Now I want you to know, brothers,
that I o en planned to come to youROMANS 1
3
(but was prevented un l now) in order
that I might have a frui ul ministry
among you, just as among the rest of the
Gen les.
14 I am obligated both to Greeks and
barbarians, both to the wise and the
foolish.
15 So I am eager to preach the good
news to you also who are in Rome.
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
because it is God's power for salva on
to everyone who believes, ﬁrst to the
Jew, and also to the Greek.
17 For in it God's righteousness is
revealed from faith to faith, just as it is
wri en: The righteous will live by faith.
18 For God's wrath is revealed from
heaven against all godlessness and
unrighteousness of people who by their
unrighteousness suppress the truth,ROMANS 1
4
19 since what can be known about God
is evident among them, because God
has shown it to them.
20 From the crea on of the world His
invisible a ributes, that is, His eternal
power and divine nature, have been
clearly seen, being understood through
what He has made. As a result, people
are without excuse.
21 For though they knew God, they
did not glorify Him as God or show
gra tude. Instead, their thinking became
nonsense, and their senseless minds
were darkened.
22 Claiming to be wise, they became
fools
23 and exchanged the glory of the
immortal God for images resembling
mortal man, birds, four-footed animals,
and rep les.
24 Therefore God delivered them over
in the cravings of their hearts to sexualROMANS 1
5
impurity, so that their bodies were
degraded among themselves.
25 They exchanged the truth of God
for a lie, and worshiped and served
something created instead of the
Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
26 This is why God delivered them
over to degrading passions. For even
their females exchanged natural sexual
intercourse for what is unnatural.
27 The males in the same way also le
natural sexual intercourse with females
and were inﬂamed in their lust for one
another. Males commi ed shameless
acts with males and received in their
own persons the appropriate penalty for
their perversion.
28 And because they did not think
it worthwhile to have God in their
knowledge, God delivered them over to
a worthless mind to do what is morally
wrong.ROMANS 1 – 2
6
29 They are ﬁlled with all
unrighteousness, evil, greed, and
wickedness. They are full of envy,
murder, disputes, deceit, and malice.
They are gossips,
30 slanderers, God-haters, arrogant,
proud, boas ul, inventors of evil,
disobedient to parents,
31 undiscerning, untrustworthy,
unloving, and unmerciful.
32 Although they know full well God's
just sentence--that those who prac ce
such things deserve to die--they not only
do them, but even applaud others who
prac ce them.
1 Therefore, anyone of you who
judges is without excuse. For when
you judge another, you condemn
yourself, since you, the judge, do the
same things.
2ROMANS 2
7
2 We know that God's judgment on
those who do such things is based on
the truth.
3 Do you really think--anyone of you
who judges those who do such things
yet do the same--that you will escape
God's judgment?
4 Or do you despise the riches of
His kindness, restraint, and pa ence,
not recognizing that God's kindness is
intended to lead you to repentance?
5 But because of your hardness and
unrepentant heart you are storing up
wrath for yourself in the day of wrath,
when God's righteous judgment is
revealed.
6 He will repay each one according to
his works :
7 eternal life to those who by pa ently
doing good seek for glory, honor, and
immortality;ROMANS 2
8 but wrath and indigna
8
on to those
who are self-seeking and disobey the
truth, but are obeying unrighteousness;
9 aﬄic on and distress for every human
being who does evil, ﬁrst to the Jew, and
also to the Greek;
10 but glory, honor, and peace for
everyone who does good, ﬁrst to the
Jew, and also to the Greek.
11 There is no favori sm with God.
12 All those who sinned without the law
will also perish without the law, and all
those who sinned under the law will be
judged by the law.
13 For the hearers of the law are not
righteous before God, but the doers of
the law will be declared righteous.
14 So, when Gen les, who do not have
the law, ins nc vely do what the law
demands, they are a law to themselves
even though they do not have the law.ROMANS 2
9
15 They show that the work of the
law is wri en on their hearts. Their
consciences tes fy in support of this,
and their compe ng thoughts either
accuse or excuse them
16 on the day when God judges what
people have kept secret, according to
my gospel through Christ Jesus.
17 Now if you call yourself a Jew, and
rest in the law, and boast in God,
18 and know His will, and approve the
things that are superior, being instructed
from the law,
19 and are convinced that you are a
guide for the blind, a light to those in
darkness,
20 an instructor of the ignorant, a
teacher of the immature, having in the
law the full expression of knowledge and
truth--ROMANS 2
10
21 you then, who teach another, do you
not teach yourself? You who preach,
"You must not steal"--do you steal?
22 You who say, "You must not commit
adultery"--do you commit adultery?
You who detest idols, do you rob their
temples?
23 You who boast in the law, do you
dishonor God by breaking the law?
24 For, as it is wri en: The name of
God is blasphemed among the Gen les
because of you.
25 For circumcision beneﬁts you if
you observe the law, but if you are
a lawbreaker, your circumcision has
become uncircumcision.
26 Therefore if an uncircumcised man
keeps the law's requirements, will
his uncircumcision not be counted as
circumcision?
27 A man who is physically
uncircumcised, but who fulﬁlls theROMANS 2 – 3
11
law, will judge you who are a lawbreaker
in spite of having the le er of the law
and circumcision.
28 For a person is not a Jew who is one
outwardly, and true circumcision is not
something visible in the ﬂesh.
29 On the contrary, a person is a Jew
who is one inwardly, and circumcision is
of the heart--by the Spirit, not the le er.
His praise is not from men but from God.
1 So what advantage does the Jew
have? Or what is the beneﬁt of
circumcision?
2 Considerable in every way. First, they
were entrusted with the spoken words
of God.
3 What then? If some did not believe,
will their unbelief cancel God's
faithfulness?
4 Absolutely not! God must be true, but
everyone is a liar, as it is wri en: That
3ROMANS 3
12
You may be jus ﬁed in Your words and
triumph when You judge.
5 But if our unrighteousness highlights
God's righteousness, what are we to
say? I use a human argument: Is God
unrighteous to inﬂict wrath?
6 Absolutely not! Otherwise, how will
God judge the world?
7 But if by my lie God's truth is ampliﬁed
to His glory, why am I also s ll judged as
a sinner?
8 And why not say, just as some people
slanderously claim we say, "Let us do
evil so that good may come"? Their
condemna on is deserved!
9 What then? Are we any be er? Not at
all! For we have previously charged that
both Jews and Gen les are all under sin,
10 as it is wri en: There is no one
righteous, not even one;
11 there is no one who understands,
there is no one who seeks God.ROMANS 3
13
12 All have turned away, together they
have become useless; there is no one
who does good, there is not even one.
13 Their throat is an open grave; they
deceive with their tongues. Vipers'
venom is under their lips.
14 Their mouth is full of cursing and
bi erness.
15 Their feet are swi to shed blood;
16 ruin and wretchedness are in their
paths,
17 and the path of peace they have not
known.
18 There is no fear of God before their
eyes.
19 Now we know that whatever the law
says speaks to those who are subject
to the law, so that every mouth may be
shut and the whole world may become
subject to God's judgment.ROMANS 3
20 For no ﬂesh will be jus
14
ﬁed in His
sight by the works of the law, for through
the law comes the knowledge of sin.
21 But now, apart from the law, God's
righteousness has been revealed--
a ested by the Law and the Prophets
22 --that is, God's righteousness through
faith in Jesus Christ, to all who believe,
since there is no dis nc on.
23 For all have sinned and fall short of
the glory of God.
24 They are jus ﬁed freely by His grace
through the redemp on that is in Christ
Jesus.
25 God presented Him as a propi a on
through faith in His blood, to
demonstrate His righteousness,
because in His restraint God passed over
the sins previously commi ed.
26 He presented Him to demonstrate
His righteousness at the present me, soROMANS 3 – 4
15
that He would be righteous and declare
righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.
27 Where then is boas ng? It is
excluded. By what kind of law? By one of
works? No, on the contrary, by a law of
faith.
28 For we conclude that a man is
jus ﬁed by faith apart from works of law.
29 Or is God for Jews only? Is He not
also for Gen les? Yes, for Gen les too,
30 since there is one God who will
jus fy the circumcised by faith and the
uncircumcised through faith.
31 Do we then cancel the law through
faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary,
we uphold the law.
1 What then can we say that
Abraham, our forefather according
to the ﬂesh, has found?
2 If Abraham was jus ﬁed by works,
then he has something to brag
about--but not before God.
4ROMANS 4
16
3 For what does the Scripture say?
Abraham believed God, and it was
credited to him for righteousness.
4 Now to the one who works, pay is not
considered as a gi , but as something
owed.
5 But to the one who does not work, but
believes on Him who declares righteous
the ungodly, his faith is credited for
righteousness.
6 Likewise, David also speaks of the
blessing of the man to whom God credits
righteousness apart from works:
7 How happy those whose lawless acts
are forgiven and whose sins are covered!
8 How happy the man whom the Lord
will never charge with sin!
9 Is this blessing only for the
circumcised, then? Or is it also for
the uncircumcised? For we say, Faith was
credited to Abraham for righteousness.ROMANS 4
17
10 How then was it credited--while he
was circumcised, or uncircumcised?
Not while he was circumcised, but
uncircumcised.
11 And he received the sign of
circumcision as a seal of the
righteousness that he had by faith
while s ll uncircumcised. This was
to make him the father of all who
believe but are not circumcised, so that
righteousness may be credited to them
also.
12 And he became the father of the
circumcised, not only to those who
are circumcised, but also to those who
follow in the footsteps of the faith
our father Abraham had while s ll
uncircumcised.
13 For the promise to Abraham or to
his descendants that he would inherit
the world was not through the law, butROMANS 4
18
through the righteousness that comes
by faith.
14 If those who are of the law are heirs,
faith is made empty and the promise is
canceled.
15 For the law produces wrath; but
where there is no law, there is no
transgression.
16 This is why the promise is by faith,
so that it may be according to grace, to
guarantee it to all the descendants--not
only to those who are of the law, but
also to those who are of Abraham's faith.
He is the father of us all
17 in God's sight. As it is wri en: I have
made you the father of many na ons.
He believed in God, who gives life to the
dead and calls things into existence that
do not exist.
18 Against hope, with hope he believed,
so that he became the father of manyROMANS 4
19
na ons, according to what had been
spoken: So will your descendants be.
19 He considered his own body to be
already dead (since he was about a
hundred years old), and the deadness of
Sarah's womb, without weakening in the
faith.
20 He did not waver in unbelief at God's
promise, but was strengthened in his
faith and gave glory to God,
21 because he was fully convinced that
what He had promised He was also able
to perform.
22 Therefore, it was credited to him for
righteousness.
23 Now it was credited to him was not
wri en for Abraham alone,
24 but also for us. It will be credited to
us who believe in Him who raised Jesus
our Lord from the dead.ROMANS 4 – 5
20
25 He was delivered up for our
trespasses and raised for our
jus ﬁca on.
1 Therefore, since we have been
declared righteous by faith, we have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ.
2 Also through Him, we have obtained
access by faith into this grace in which
we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of
the glory of God.
3 And not only that, but we also rejoice
in our aﬄic ons, because we know that
aﬄic on produces endurance,
4 endurance produces proven character,
and proven character produces hope.
5 This hope does not disappoint,
because God's love has been poured out
in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who
was given to us.
5ROMANS 5
6 For while we were s
21
ll helpless, at the
appointed moment, Christ died for the
ungodly.
7 For rarely will someone die for a
just person--though for a good person
perhaps someone might even dare to
die.
8 But God proves His own love for us in
that while we were s ll sinners Christ
died for us!
9 Much more then, since we have now
been declared righteous by His blood,
we will be saved through Him from
wrath.
10 For if, while we were enemies, we
were reconciled to God through the
death of His Son, then how much more,
having been reconciled, will we be saved
by His life!
11 And not only that, but we also rejoice
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,ROMANS 5
22
through whom we have now received
reconcilia on.
12 Therefore, just as sin entered the
world through one man, and death
through sin, in this way death spread to
all men, because all sinned.
13 In fact, sin was in the world before
the law, but sin is not charged to one's
account when there is no law.
14 Nevertheless, death reigned from
Adam to Moses, even over those who
did not sin in the likeness of Adam's
transgression. He is a prototype of the
Coming One.
15 But the gi is not like the trespass.
For if by the one man's trespass the
many died, how much more have the
grace of God and the gi overﬂowed to
the many by the grace of the one man,
Jesus Christ.
16 And the gi is not like the one man's
sin, because from one sin came theROMANS 5
23
judgment, resul ng in condemna on,
but from many trespasses came the gi ,
resul ng in jus ﬁca on.
17 Since by the one man's trespass,
death reigned through that one man,
how much more will those who receive
the overﬂow of grace and the gi of
righteousness reign in life through the
one man, Jesus Christ.
18 So then, as through one trespass
there is condemna on for everyone, so
also through one righteous act there is
life-giving jus ﬁca on for everyone.
19 For just as through one man's
disobedience the many were made
sinners, so also through the one man's
obedience the many will be made
righteous.
20 The law came along to mul ply the
trespass. But where sin mul plied, grace
mul plied even more,ROMANS 5 – 6
24
21 so that, just as sin reigned in
death, so also grace will reign through
righteousness, resul ng in eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 What should we say then? Should
we con nue in sin in order that grace
may mul ply?
2 Absolutely not! How can we who died
to sin s ll live in it?
3 Or are you unaware that all of us who
were bap zed into Christ Jesus were
bap zed into His death?
4 Therefore we were buried with Him
by bap sm into death, in order that, just
as Christ was raised from the dead by
the glory of the Father, so we too may
walk in a new way of life.
5 For if we have been joined with Him
in the likeness of His death, we will
certainly also be in the likeness of His
resurrec on.
6ROMANS 6
25
6 For we know that our old self
was cruciﬁed with Him in order that
sin's dominion over the body may be
abolished, so that we may no longer be
enslaved to sin,
7 since a person who has died is freed
from sin's claims.
8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe
that we will also live with Him,
9 because we know that Christ, having
been raised from the dead, no longer
dies. Death no longer rules over Him.
10 For in that He died, He died to sin
once for all; but in that He lives, He lives
to God.
11 So, you too consider yourselves dead
to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your
mortal body, so that you obey its desires.
13 And do not oﬀer any parts of it to
sin as weapons for unrighteousness. But
as those who are alive from the dead,ROMANS 6
26
oﬀer yourselves to God, and all the parts
of yourselves to God as weapons for
righteousness.
14 For sin will not rule over you, because
you are not under law but under grace.
15 What then? Should we sin because
we are not under law but under grace?
Absolutely not!
16 Do you not know that if you oﬀer
yourselves to someone as obedient
slaves, you are slaves of that one you
obey--either of sin leading to death or of
obedience leading to righteousness?
17 But thank God that, although you
used to be slaves of sin, you obeyed
from the heart that pa ern of teaching
you were entrusted to,
18 and having been liberated from sin,
you became enslaved to righteousness.
19 I am using a human analogy because
of the weakness of your ﬂesh. For just
as you oﬀered the parts of yourselves asROMANS 6 – 7
27
slaves to moral impurity, and to greater
and greater lawlessness, so now oﬀer
them as slaves to righteousness, which
results in sanc ﬁca on.
20 For when you were slaves of sin,
you were free from allegiance to
righteousness.
21 And what fruit was produced then
from the things you are now ashamed
of? For the end of those things is death.
22 But now, since you have been
liberated from sin and become enslaved
to God, you have your fruit, which results
in sanc ﬁca on--and the end is eternal
life!
23 For the wages of sin is death, but the
gi of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus
our Lord.
1 Since I am speaking to those who
understand law, brothers, are you
unaware that the law has authority over
someone as long as he lives?
7ROMANS 7
28
2 For example, a married woman is
legally bound to her husband while
he lives. But if her husband dies, she
is released from the law regarding the
husband.
3 So then, if she gives herself to another
man while her husband is living, she
will be called an adulteress. But if her
husband dies, she is free from that law.
Then, if she gives herself to another
man, she is not an adulteress.
4 Therefore, my brothers, you also
were put to death in rela on to the
law through the cruciﬁed body of the
Messiah, so that you may belong to
another--to Him who was raised from
the dead--that we may bear fruit for
God.
5 For when we were in the ﬂesh, the
sinful passions operated through the
law in every part of us and bore fruit for
death.ROMANS 7
29
6 But now we have been released from
the law, since we have died to what held
us, so that we may serve in the new way
of the Spirit and not in the old le er of
the law.
7 What should we say then? Is the law
sin? Absolutely not! On the contrary, I
would not have known sin if it were not
for the law. For example, I would not
have known what it is to covet if the law
had not said, You shall not covet.
8 And sin, seizing an opportunity
through the commandment, produced
in me cove ng of every kind. For apart
from the law sin is dead.
9 Once I was alive apart from the law,
but when the commandment came, sin
sprang to life
10 and I died. The commandment that
was meant for life resulted in death for
me.ROMANS 7
30
11 For sin, seizing an opportunity
through the commandment, deceived
me, and through it killed me.
12 So then, the law is holy, and the
commandment is holy and just and
good.
13 Therefore, did what is good cause my
death? Absolutely not! On the contrary,
sin, in order to be recognized as sin,
was producing death in me through
what is good, so that through the
commandment sin might become sinful
beyond measure.
14 For we know that the law is spiritual;
but I am made out of ﬂesh, sold into sin's
power.
15 For I do not understand what I am
doing, because I do not prac ce what I
want to do, but I do what I hate.
16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I
agree with the law that it is good.ROMANS 7
31
17 So now I am no longer the one doing
it, but it is sin living in me.
18 For I know that nothing good lives in
me, that is, in my ﬂesh. For the desire to
do what is good is with me, but there is
no ability to do it.
19 For I do not do the good that I want
to do, but I prac ce the evil that I do not
want to do.
20 Now if I do what I do not want, I am
no longer the one doing it, but it is the
sin that lives in me.
21 So I discover this principle: when I
want to do good, evil is with me.
22 For in my inner self I joyfully agree
with God's law.
23 But I see a diﬀerent law in the parts
of my body, waging war against the law
of my mind and taking me prisoner to
the law of sin in the parts of my body.
24 What a wretched man I am! Who will
rescue me from this body of death?ROMANS 7 – 8
32
25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our
Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am
a slave to the law of God, but with my
ﬂesh, to the law of sin.
1 Therefore, no condemna on now
exists for those in Christ Jesus,
2 because the Spirit's law of life in Christ
Jesus has set you free from the law of sin
and of death.
3 What the law could not do since it
was limited by the ﬂesh, God did. He
condemned sin in the ﬂesh by sending
His own Son in ﬂesh like ours under sin's
domain, and as a sin oﬀering,
4 in order that the law's requirement
would be accomplished in us who do not
walk according to the ﬂesh but according
to the Spirit.
5 For those whose lives are according
to the ﬂesh think about the things of
the ﬂesh, but those whose lives are
8ROMANS 8
33
according to the Spirit, about the things
of the Spirit.
6 For the mind-set of the ﬂesh is death,
but the mind-set of the Spirit is life and
peace.
7 For the mind-set of the ﬂesh is hos le
to God because it does not submit itself
to God's law, for it is unable to do so.
8 Those whose lives are in the ﬂesh are
unable to please God.
9 You, however, are not in the ﬂesh, but
in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God lives
in you. But if anyone does not have the
Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to
Him.
10 Now if Christ is in you, the body is
dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life
because of righteousness.
11 And if the Spirit of Him who raised
Jesus from the dead lives in you, then He
who raised Christ from the dead will alsoROMANS 8
34
bring your mortal bodies to life through
His Spirit who lives in you.
12 So then, brothers, we are not
obligated to the ﬂesh to live according to
the ﬂesh,
13 for if you live according to the ﬂesh,
you are going to die. But if by the Spirit
you put to death the deeds of the body,
you will live.
14 All those led by God's Spirit are God's
sons.
15 For you did not receive a spirit of
slavery to fall back into fear, but you
received the Spirit of adop on, by whom
we cry out, "Abba, Father!"
16 The Spirit Himself tes ﬁes together
with our spirit that we are God's
children,
17 and if children, also heirs--heirs of
God and co-heirs with Christ--seeing that
we suﬀer with Him so that we may also
be gloriﬁed with Him.ROMANS 8
35
18 For I consider that the suﬀerings
of this present me are not worth
comparing with the glory that is going to
be revealed to us.
19 For the crea on eagerly waits
with an cipa on for God's sons to be
revealed.
20 For the crea on was subjected to
fu lity--not willingly, but because of Him
who subjected it--in the hope
21 that the crea on itself will also be set
free from the bondage of corrup on into
the glorious freedom of God's children.
22 For we know that the whole crea on
has been groaning together with labor
pains un l now.
23 And not only that, but we ourselves
who have the Spirit as the ﬁrs ruits--we
also groan within ourselves, eagerly
wai ng for adop on, the redemp on of
our bodies.ROMANS 8
36
24 Now in this hope we were saved, yet
hope that is seen is not hope, because
who hopes for what he sees?
25 But if we hope for what we do not
see, we eagerly wait for it with pa ence.
26 In the same way the Spirit also joins
to help in our weakness, because we do
not know what to pray for as we should,
but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us
with unspoken groanings.
27 And He who searches the hearts
knows the Spirit's mind-set, because He
intercedes for the saints according to the
will of God.
28 We know that all things work
together for the good of those who love
God: those who are called according to
His purpose.
29 For those He foreknew He also
predes ned to be conformed to the
image of His Son, so that He would be
the ﬁrstborn among many brothers.ROMANS 8
30 And those He predes
37
ned, He also
called; and those He called, He also
jus ﬁed; and those He jus ﬁed, He also
gloriﬁed.
31 What then are we to say about these
things? If God is for us, who is against
us?
32 He did not even spare His own Son,
but oﬀered Him up for us all; how will He
not also with Him grant us everything?
33 Who can bring an accusa on against
God's elect? God is the One who jus ﬁes.
34 Who is the one who condemns?
Christ Jesus is the One who died, but
even more, has been raised; He also is at
the right hand of God and intercedes for
us.
35 Who can separate us from the love
of Christ? Can aﬄic on or anguish or
persecu on or famine or nakedness or
danger or sword?ROMANS 8 – 9
36 As it is wri
38
en: Because of You we
are being put to death all day long; we
are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
37 No, in all these things we are more
than victorious through Him who loved
us.
38 For I am persuaded that neither
death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor
powers,
39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other
created thing will have the power to
separate us from the love of God that is
in Christ Jesus our Lord!
1 I speak the truth in Christ--I am not
lying; my conscience is tes fying to
me with the Holy Spirit--
2 that I have intense sorrow and
con nual anguish in my heart.
3 For I could wish that I myself were
cursed and cut oﬀ from the Messiah
9ROMANS 9
39
for the beneﬁt of my brothers, my
countrymen by physical descent.
4 They are Israelites, and to them
belong the adop on, the glory, the
covenants, the giving of the law, the
temple service, and the promises.
5 The forefathers are theirs, and from
them, by physical descent, came the
Messiah, who is God over all, blessed
forever. Amen.
6 But it is not as though the word of God
has failed. For not all who are descended
from Israel are Israel.
7 Neither are they all children because
they are Abraham's descendants. On
the contrary, in Isaac your seed will be
called.
8 That is, it is not the children by
physical descent who are God's children,
but the children of the promise are
considered seed.ROMANS 9
40
9 For this is the statement of the
promise: At this me I will come, and
Sarah will have a son.
10 And not only that, but also when
Rebekah became pregnant by Isaac our
forefather
11 (for though they had not been born
yet or done anything good or bad, so
that God's purpose according to elec on
might stand,
12 not from works but from the One
who calls) she was told: The older will
serve the younger.
13 As it is wri en: Jacob I have loved,
but Esau I have hated.
14 What should we say then? Is there
injus ce with God? Absolutely not!
15 For He tells Moses: I will show
mercy to whom I show mercy, and I
will have compassion on whom I have
compassion.ROMANS 9
41
16 So then it does not depend on human
will or eﬀort, but on God who shows
mercy.
17 For the Scripture tells Pharaoh: For
this reason I raised you up: so that I may
display My power in you, and that My
name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
18 So then, He shows mercy to whom
He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.
19 You will say to me, therefore, "Why
then does He s ll ﬁnd fault? For who can
resist His will?"
20 But who are you--anyone who talks
back to God? Will what is formed say to
the one who formed it, "Why did you
make me like this?"
21 Or has the po er no right over His
clay, to make from the same lump one
piece of po ery for honor and another
for dishonor?
22 And what if God, desiring to display
His wrath and to make His power known,ROMANS 9
42
endured with much pa ence objects of
wrath ready for destruc on?
23 And what if He did this to make
known the riches of His glory on objects
of mercy that He prepared beforehand
for glory--
24 on us whom He also called, not
only from the Jews but also from the
Gen les?
25 As He also says in Hosea: I will call
"Not-My-People," "My-People," and she
who is "Unloved," "Beloved."
26 And it will be in the place where they
were told, you are not My people, there
they will be called sons of the living God.
27 But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:
Though the number of Israel's sons is like
the sand of the sea, only the remnant
will be saved;
28 for the Lord will execute His sentence
completely and decisively on the earth.ROMANS 9 – 10
43
29 And just as Isaiah predicted: If the
Lord of Hosts had not le us a seed, we
would have become like Sodom, and we
would have been made like Gomorrah.
30 What should we say then? Gen les,
who did not pursue righteousness, have
obtained righteousness--namely the
righteousness that comes from faith.
31 But Israel, pursuing the law for
righteousness, has not achieved the law.
32 Why is that? Because they did not
pursue it by faith, but as if it were
by works. They stumbled over the
stumbling stone.
33 As it is wri en: Look! I am pu ng a
stone in Zion to stumble over, and a rock
to trip over, yet the one who believes on
Him will not be put to shame.
1 Brothers, my heart's desire and
prayer to God concerning them is
for their salva on!
10ROMANS 10
2 I can tes
44
fy about them that they
have zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge.
3 Because they disregarded the
righteousness from God and a empted
to establish their own righteousness,
they have not submi ed to God's
righteousness.
4 For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to everyone who believes.
5 For Moses writes about the
righteousness that is from the law: The
one who does these things will live by
them.
6 But the righteousness that comes
from faith speaks like this: Do not say in
your heart, "Who will go up to heaven?"
that is, to bring Christ down
7 or, "Who will go down into the abyss?"
that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.
8 On the contrary, what does it say? The
message is near you, in your mouth andROMANS 10
45
in your heart. This is the message of faith
that we proclaim:
9 if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus
is Lord," and believe in your heart that
God raised Him from the dead, you will
be saved.
10 With the heart one believes, resul ng
in righteousness, and with the mouth
one confesses, resul ng in salva on.
11 Now the Scripture says, No one who
believes on Him will be put to shame,
12 for there is no dis nc on between
Jew and Greek, since the same Lord of
all is rich to all who call on Him.
13 For everyone who calls on the name
of the Lord will be saved.
14 But how can they call on Him in
whom they have not believed? And how
can they believe without hearing about
Him? And how can they hear without a
preacher?ROMANS 10
46
15 And how can they preach unless they
are sent? As it is wri en: How welcome
are the feet of those who announce the
gospel of good things!
16 But all did not obey the gospel. For
Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our
message?
17 So faith comes from what is heard,
and what is heard comes through the
message about Christ.
18 But I ask, "Did they not hear?" Yes,
they did: Their voice has gone out to all
the earth, and their words to the ends of
the inhabited world.
19 But I ask, "Did Israel not understand?"
First, Moses said: I will make you jealous
of those who are not a na on; I will
make you angry by a na on that lacks
understanding.
20 And Isaiah says boldly: I was found
by those who were not looking for Me; IROMANS 10 – 11
47
revealed Myself to those who were not
asking for Me.
21 But to Israel he says: All day long
I have spread out My hands to a
disobedient and deﬁant people.
1 I ask, then, has God rejected
His people? Absolutely not! For
I too am an Israelite, a descendant of
Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
2 God has not rejected His people
whom He foreknew. Or do you not know
what the Scripture says in the Elijah
sec on--how he pleads with God against
Israel?
3 Lord, they have killed Your prophets,
torn down Your altars; and I am the only
one le , and they are trying to take my
life!
4 But what was God's reply to him? I
have le 7,000 men for Myself who have
not bowed down to Baal.
11ROMANS 11
48
5 In the same way, then, there is also at
the present me a remnant chosen by
grace.
6 Now if by grace, then it is not by
works; otherwise grace ceases to be
grace.
7 What then? Israel did not ﬁnd what it
was looking for, but the elect did ﬁnd it.
The rest were hardened,
8 as it is wri en: God gave them a spirit
of stupor, eyes that cannot see and ears
that cannot hear, to this day .
9 And David says: Let their feas ng
become a snare and a trap, a pi all and
a retribu on to them.
10 Let their eyes be darkened so they
cannot see, and their backs be bent
con nually.
11 I ask, then, have they stumbled so as
to fall? Absolutely not! On the contrary,
by their stumbling, salva on has come
to the Gen les to make Israel jealous.ROMANS 11
49
12 Now if their stumbling brings riches
for the world, and their failure riches for
the Gen les, how much more will their
full number bring!
13 Now I am speaking to you Gen les.
In view of the fact that I am an apostle
to the Gen les, I magnify my ministry,
14 if I can somehow make my own
people jealous and save some of them.
15 For if their being rejected is world
reconcilia on, what will their acceptance
mean but life from the dead?
16 Now if the ﬁrs ruits oﬀered up are
holy, so is the whole batch. And if the
root is holy, so are the branches.
17 Now if some of the branches were
broken oﬀ, and you, though a wild olive
branch, were gra ed in among them,
and have come to share in the rich root
of the cul vated olive tree,
18 do not brag that you are be er than
those branches. But if you do brag--youROMANS 11
50
do not sustain the root, but the root
sustains you.
19 Then you will say, "Branches were
broken oﬀ so that I might be gra ed in."
20 True enough; they were broken oﬀ
by unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do
not be arrogant, but be afraid.
21 For if God did not spare the natural
branches, He will not spare you either.
22 Therefore, consider God's kindness
and severity: severity toward those who
have fallen, but God's kindness toward
you--if you remain in His kindness.
Otherwise you too will be cut oﬀ.
23 And even they, if they do not remain
in unbelief, will be gra ed in, because
God has the power to gra them in
again.
24 For if you were cut oﬀ from your
na ve wild olive, and against nature
were gra ed into a cul vated olive tree,
how much more will these--the naturalROMANS 11
51
branches--be gra ed into their own olive
tree?
25 So that you will not be conceited,
brothers, I do not want you to be
unaware of this mystery: a par al
hardening has come to Israel un l the
full number of the Gen les has come in.
26 And in this way all Israel will be saved,
as it is wri en: The Liberator will come
from Zion; He will turn away godlessness
from Jacob.
27 And this will be My covenant with
them, when I take away their sins.
28 Regarding the gospel, they are
enemies for your advantage, but
regarding elec on, they are loved
because of their forefathers,
29 since God's gracious gi s and calling
are irrevocable.
30 As you once disobeyed God, but
now have received mercy through their
disobedience,ROMANS 11 – 12
52
31 so they too have now disobeyed,
resul ng in mercy to you, so that they
also now may receive mercy.
32 For God has imprisoned all in
disobedience, so that He may have
mercy on all.
33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of
the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
How unsearchable His judgments and
untraceable His ways!
34 For who has known the mind of the
Lord? Or who has been His counselor?
35 Or who has ever ﬁrst given to Him,
and has to be repaid?
36 For from Him and through Him and
to Him are all things. To Him be the glory
forever. Amen.
1 Therefore, brothers, by the
mercies of God, I urge you to
present your bodies as a living sacriﬁce,
holy and pleasing to God; this is your
spiritual worship.
12ROMANS 12
53
2 Do not be conformed to this age, but
be transformed by the renewing of your
mind, so that you may discern what is
the good, pleasing, and perfect will of
God.
3 For by the grace given to me, I tell
everyone among you not to think of
himself more highly than he should
think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has
distributed a measure of faith to each
one.
4 Now as we have many parts in one
body, and all the parts do not have the
same func on,
5 in the same way we who are many
are one body in Christ and individually
members of one another.
6 According to the grace given to us, we
have diﬀerent gi s: If prophecy, use it
according to the standard of faith;
7 if service, in service; if teaching, in
teaching;ROMANS 12
8 if exhor
54
ng, in exhorta on; giving,
with generosity; leading, with diligence;
showing mercy, with cheerfulness.
9 Love must be without hypocrisy.
Detest evil; cling to what is good.
10 Show family aﬀec on to one another
with brotherly love. Outdo one another
in showing honor.
11 Do not lack diligence; be fervent in
spirit; serve the Lord.
12 Rejoice in hope; be pa ent in
aﬄic on; be persistent in prayer.
13 Share with the saints in their needs;
pursue hospitality.
14 Bless those who persecute you; bless
and do not curse.
15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep
with those who weep.
16 Be in agreement with one another.
Do not be proud; instead, associate with
the humble. Do not be wise in your own
es ma on.ROMANS 12 – 13
55
17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Try
to do what is honorable in everyone's
eyes.
18 If possible, on your part, live at peace
with everyone.
19 Friends, do not avenge yourselves;
instead, leave room for His wrath. For it
is wri en: Vengeance belongs to Me; I
will repay, says the Lord.
20 But If your enemy is hungry, feed
him. If he is thirsty, give him something
to drink. For in so doing you will be
heaping ﬁery coals on his head.
21 Do not be conquered by evil, but
conquer evil with good.
1 Everyone must submit to the
governing authori es, for there is
no authority except from God, and those
that exist are ins tuted by God.
2 So then, the one who resists the
authority is opposing God's command,
13ROMANS 13
56
and those who oppose it will bring
judgment on themselves.
3 For rulers are not a terror to good
conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be
unafraid of the authority? Do good and
you will have its approval.
4 For government is God's servant to
you for good. But if you do wrong, be
afraid, because it does not carry the
sword for no reason. For government
is God's servant, an avenger that brings
wrath on the one who does wrong.
5 Therefore, you must submit, not only
because of wrath, but also because of
your conscience.
6 And for this reason you pay taxes,
since the authori es are God's public
servants, con nually a ending to these
tasks.
7 Pay your obliga ons to everyone:
taxes to those you owe taxes, tolls to
those you owe tolls, respect to thoseROMANS 13
57
you owe respect, and honor to those
you owe honor.
8 Do not owe anyone anything, except
to love one another, for the one who
loves another has fulﬁlled the law.
9 The commandments: You shall not
commit adultery, you shall not murder,
you shall not steal, you shall not covet,
and if there is any other commandment-
-all are summed up by this: You shall
love your neighbor as yourself.
10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor.
Love, therefore, is the fulﬁllment of the
law.
11 Besides this, knowing the me, it is
already the hour for you to wake up from
sleep, for now our salva on is nearer
than when we ﬁrst believed.
12 The night is nearly over, and the
daylight is near, so let us discard the
deeds of darkness and put on the armor
of light.ROMANS 13 – 14
58
13 Let us walk with decency, as in
the daylight: not in carousing and
drunkenness; not in sexual impurity
and promiscuity; not in quarreling and
jealousy.
14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and make no plans to sa sfy the ﬂeshly
desires.
1 Accept anyone who is weak
in faith, but don't argue about
doub ul issues.
2 One person believes he may eat
anything, but one who is weak eats only
vegetables.
3 One who eats must not look down
on one who does not eat; and one who
does not eat must not cri cize one who
does, because God has accepted him.
4 Who are you to cri cize another's
household slave? Before his own Lord he
stands or falls. And stand he will! For the
Lord is able to make him stand.
14ROMANS 14
59
5 One person considers one day to
be above another day. Someone else
considers every day to be the same. Each
one must be fully convinced in his own
mind.
6 Whoever observes the day, observes
it to the Lord. Whoever eats, eats to the
Lord, since he gives thanks to God; and
whoever does not eat, it is to the Lord
that he does not eat, yet he thanks God.
7 For none of us lives to himself, and no
one dies to himself.
8 If we live, we live to the Lord; and if
we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore,
whether we live or die, we belong to the
Lord.
9 Christ died and came to life for this:
that He might rule over both the dead
and the living.
10 But you, why do you cri cize your
brother? Or you, why do you look downROMANS 14
60
on your brother? For we will all stand
before the judgment seat of God.
11 For it is wri en: As I live, says the
Lord, every knee will bow to Me, and
every tongue will give praise to God.
12 So then, each of us will give an
account of himself to God.
13 Therefore, let us no longer cri cize
one another, but instead decide not to
put a stumbling block or pi all in your
brother's way.
14 (I know and am persuaded by the
Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in
itself. S ll, to someone who considers
a thing to be unclean, to that one it is
unclean.)
15 For if your brother is hurt by what
you eat, you are no longer walking
according to love. By what you eat, do
not destroy that one for whom Christ
died.ROMANS 14
61
16 Therefore, do not let your good be
slandered,
17 for the kingdom of God is not ea ng
and drinking, but righteousness, peace,
and joy in the Holy Spirit.
18 Whoever serves the Messiah in this
way is acceptable to God and approved
by men.
19 So then, we must pursue what
promotes peace and what builds up one
another.
20 Do not tear down God's work
because of food. Everything is clean, but
it is wrong for a man to cause stumbling
by what he eats.
21 It is a noble thing not to eat meat, or
drink wine, or do anything that makes
your brother stumble.
22 Do you have faith? Keep it to yourself
before God. Blessed is the man who
does not condemn himself by what he
approves.ROMANS 14 – 15
62
23 But whoever doubts stands
condemned if he eats, because his
ea ng is not from faith, and everything
that is not from faith is sin.
1 Now we who are strong have an
obliga on to bear the weaknesses
of those without strength, and not to
please ourselves.
2 Each one of us must please his
neighbor for his good, in order to build
him up.
3 For even the Messiah did not please
Himself. On the contrary, as it is wri en,
The insults of those who insult You have
fallen on Me.
4 For whatever was wri en before
was wri en for our instruc on, so that
through our endurance and through the
encouragement of the Scriptures we
may have hope.
5 Now may the God of endurance and
encouragement grant you agreement
15ROMANS 15
63
with one another, according to Christ
Jesus,
6 so that you may glorify the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with a
united mind and voice.
7 Therefore accept one another, just as
the Messiah also accepted you, to the
glory of God.
8 Now I say that Christ has become a
servant of the circumcised on behalf
of the truth of God, to conﬁrm the
promises to the fathers,
9 and so that Gen les may glorify God
for His mercy. As it is wri en: Therefore I
will praise You among the Gen les, and I
will sing psalms to Your name.
10 Again it says: Rejoice, you Gen les,
with His people!
11 And again: Praise the Lord, all you
Gen les; all the peoples should praise
Him!ROMANS 15
64
12 And again, Isaiah says: The root of
Jesse will appear, the One who rises to
rule the Gen les; in Him the Gen les will
hope.
13 Now may the God of hope ﬁll you
with all joy and peace in believing, so
that you may overﬂow with hope by the
power of the Holy Spirit.
14 Now, my brothers, I myself am
convinced about you that you also
are full of goodness, ﬁlled with all
knowledge, and able to instruct one
another.
15 Nevertheless, to remind you, I have
wri en to you more boldly on some
points because of the grace given me by
God
16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus
to the Gen les, serving as a priest of
God's good news. My purpose is that
the oﬀering of the Gen les may be
acceptable, sanc ﬁed by the Holy Spirit.ROMANS 15

17 Therefore I have reason to boast in
Christ Jesus regarding what pertains to
God.
18 For I would not dare say anything
except what Christ has accomplished
through me to make the Gen les
obedient by word and deed,
19 by the power of miraculous signs and
wonders, and by the power of God's
Spirit. As a result, I have fully proclaimed
the good news about the Messiah
from Jerusalem all the way around to
Illyricum.
20 So my aim is to evangelize where
Christ has not been named, in order that
I will not be building on someone else's
founda on,
21 but, as it is wri en: Those who had
no report of Him will see, and those who
have not heard will understand.
22 That is why I have been prevented
many mes from coming to you.ROMANS 15
66
23 But now I no longer have any work
to do in these provinces, and I have
strongly desired for many years to come
to you
24 whenever I travel to Spain. For I do
hope to see you when I pass through,
and to be sent on my way there by you,
once I have ﬁrst enjoyed your company
for a while.
25 Now, however, I am traveling to
Jerusalem to serve the saints;
26 for Macedonia and Achaia were
pleased to make a contribu on to the
poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
27 Yes, they were pleased, and they are
indebted to them. For if the Gen les
have shared in their spiritual beneﬁts,
then they are obligated to minister to
Jews in material needs.
28 So when I have ﬁnished this and
safely delivered the funds to them, I will
go by way of you to Spain.ROMANS 15 – 16
67
29 But I know that when I come to you, I
will come in the fullness of the blessing
of Christ.
30 Now I implore you, brothers, through
the Lord Jesus Christ and through the
love of the Spirit, to agonize together
with me in your prayers to God on my
behalf:
31 that I may be rescued from the
unbelievers in Judea, that my service
for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the
saints,
32 and that, by God's will, I may come to
you with joy and be refreshed together
with you.
33 The God of peace be with all of you.
Amen.
1 I commend to you our sister
Phoebe, who is a servant of the
church in Cenchreae.
2 So you should welcome her in the
Lord in a manner worthy of the saints,
16ROMANS 16
68
and assist her in whatever ma er she
may require your help. For indeed she
has been a benefactor of many--and of
me also.
3 Give my gree ngs to Prisca and Aquila,
my co-workers in Christ Jesus,
4 who risked their own necks for my life.
Not only do I thank them, but so do all
the Gen le churches.
5 Greet also the church that meets
in their home. Greet my dear friend
Epaenetus, who is the ﬁrst convert to
Christ from Asia.
6 Greet Mary, who has worked very
hard for you.
7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow
countrymen and fellow prisoners. They
are outstanding among the apostles, and
they were also in Christ before me.
8 Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the
Lord.ROMANS 16
69
9 Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in
Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
10 Greet Apelles, who is approved in
Christ. Greet those who belong to the
household of Aristobulus.
11 Greet Herodion, my fellow
countryman. Greet those who belong to
the household of Narcissus who are in
the Lord.
12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who
have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my
dear friend Persis, who has worked very
hard in the Lord.
13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord; also
his mother--and mine.
14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes,
Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who
are with them.
15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus
and his sister, and Olympas, and all the
saints who are with them.ROMANS 16
70
16 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the churches of Christ send you
gree ngs.
17 Now I implore you, brothers, watch
out for those who cause dissensions and
pi alls contrary to the doctrine you have
learned. Avoid them;
18 for such people do not serve our Lord
Christ but their own appe tes, and by
smooth talk and ﬂa ering words they
deceive the hearts of the unsuspec ng.
19 The report of your obedience has
reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice
over you. But I want you to be wise
about what is good, yet innocent about
what is evil.
20 The God of peace will soon crush
Satan under your feet. The grace of our
Lord Jesus be with you.
21 Timothy, my co-worker, and Lucius,
Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow
countrymen, greet you.ROMANS 16
22 I Ter
71
us, who penned this epistle in
the Lord, greet you.
23 Gaius, who is host to me and to the
whole church, greets you. Erastus, the
city treasurer, and our brother Quartus
greet you.
24 [The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all.]
25 Now to Him who has power to
strengthen you according to my gospel
and the proclama on of Jesus Christ,
according to the revela on of the sacred
secret kept silent for long ages,
26 but now revealed and made known
through the prophe c Scriptures,
according to the command of the eternal
God, to advance the obedience of faith
among all na ons--
27 to the only wise God, through Jesus
Christ--to Him be the glory forever!
Amen.1 Corinthians
1
1 Paul, called as an apostle of Christ
Jesus by God's will, and our brother
Sosthenes:
2 To God's church at Corinth, to those
who are sanc ﬁed in Christ Jesus and
called as saints, with all those in every
place who call on the name of Jesus
Christ our Lord--theirs and ours.
3 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I always thank my God for you because
of God's grace given to you in Christ
Jesus,
5 that by Him you were made rich
in everything--in all speaking and all
knowledge--
6 as the tes mony about Christ was
conﬁrmed among you,1 CORINTHIANS 1
2
7 so that you do not lack any spiritual
gi as you eagerly wait for the revela on
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
8 He will also conﬁrm you to the end,
blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
9 God is faithful; by Him you were called
into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ
our Lord.
10 Now I urge you, brothers, in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you
all say the same thing, that there be no
divisions among you, and that you be
united with the same understanding and
the same convic on.
11 For it has been reported to me about
you, my brothers, by members of Chloe's
household, that there are quarrels
among you.
12 What I am saying is this: each of
you says, "I'm with Paul," or "I'm with1 CORINTHIANS 1
3
Apollos," or "I'm with Cephas," or "I'm
with Christ."
13 Is Christ divided? Was it Paul who
was cruciﬁed for you? Or were you
bap zed in Paul's name?
14 I thank God that I bap zed none of
you except Crispus and Gaius,
15 so that no one can say you had been
bap zed in my name.
16 I did, in fact, bap ze the household
of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't know
if I bap zed anyone else.
17 For Christ did not send me to bap ze,
but to preach the gospel--not with clever
words, so that the cross of Christ will not
be emp ed of its eﬀect .
18 For to those who are perishing the
message of the cross is foolishness, but
to us who are being saved it is God's
power.1 CORINTHIANS 1
19 For it is wri
4
en: I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside
the understanding of the experts.
20 Where is the philosopher? Where
is the scholar? Where is the debater of
this age? Hasn't God made the world's
wisdom foolish?
21 For since, in God's wisdom, the world
did not know God through wisdom, God
was pleased to save those who believe
through the foolishness of the message
preached.
22 For the Jews ask for signs and the
Greeks seek wisdom,
23 but we preach Christ cruciﬁed,
a stumbling block to the Jews and
foolishness to the Gen les.
24 Yet to those who are called, both
Jews and Greeks, Christ is God's power
and God's wisdom,
25 because God's foolishness is wiser
than human wisdom, and God's1 CORINTHIANS 1
5
weakness is stronger than human
strength.
26 Brothers, consider your calling:
not many are wise from a human
perspec ve, not many powerful, not
many of noble birth.
27 Instead, God has chosen the world's
foolish things to shame the wise, and
God has chosen the world's weak things
to shame the strong.
28 God has chosen the world's
insigniﬁcant and despised things--the
things viewed as nothing--so He might
bring to nothing the things that are
viewed as something,
29 so that no one can boast in His
presence.
30 But from Him you are in Christ Jesus,
who for us became wisdom from God,
as well as righteousness, sanc ﬁca on,
and redemp on,1 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
31 in order that, as it is wri
6
en: The one
who boasts must boast in the Lord.
1 When I came to you, brothers,
announcing the tes mony of God
to you, I did not come with brilliance of
speech or wisdom.
2 For I determined to know nothing
among you except Jesus Christ and Him
cruciﬁed.
3 And I was with you in weakness, in
fear, and in much trembling.
4 My speech and my proclama on were
not with persuasive words of wisdom,
but with a demonstra on of the Spirit
and power,
5 so that your faith might not be based
on men's wisdom but on God's power.
6 However, among the mature we do
speak a wisdom, but not a wisdom of
this age, or of the rulers of this age, who
are coming to nothing.
21 CORINTHIANS 2
7
7 On the contrary, we speak God's
hidden wisdom in a mystery, which God
predes ned before the ages for our
glory.
8 None of the rulers of this age knew it,
for if they had known it, they would not
have cruciﬁed the Lord of glory.
9 But as it is wri en: What no eye has
seen and no ear has heard, and what has
never come into a man's heart, is what
God has prepared for those who love
Him.
10 Now God has revealed them to us
by the Spirit, for the Spirit searches
everything, even the deep things of God.
11 For who among men knows the
concerns of a man except the spirit of
the man that is in him? In the same
way, no one knows the concerns of God
except the Spirit of God.
12 Now we have not received the spirit
of the world, but the Spirit who is from1 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
8
God, in order to know what has been
freely given to us by God.
13 We also speak these things, not in
words taught by human wisdom, but in
those taught by the Spirit, explaining
spiritual things to spiritual people.
14 But the natural man does not
welcome what comes from God's Spirit,
because it is foolishness to him; he is
not able to know it since it is evaluated
spiritually.
15 The spiritual person, however, can
evaluate everything, yet he himself
cannot be evaluated by anyone.
16 For: who has known the Lord's mind,
that he may instruct Him? But we have
the mind of Christ.
1 Brothers, I was not able to speak to
you as spiritual people but as people
of the ﬂesh, as babies in Christ.
31 CORINTHIANS 3
9
2 I fed you milk, not solid food, because
you were not yet able to receive it. In
fact, you are s ll not able,
3 because you are s ll ﬂeshly. For since
there is envy and strife among you, are
you not ﬂeshly and living like ordinary
people?
4 For whenever someone says, "I'm with
Paul," and another, "I'm with Apollos,"
are you not typical men?
5 So, what is Apollos? And what is Paul?
They are servants through whom you
believed, and each has the role the Lord
has given.
6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God
gave the growth.
7 So then neither the one who plants
nor the one who waters is anything, but
only God who gives the growth.
8 Now the one who plants and the one
who waters are equal, and each will1 CORINTHIANS 3
10
receive his own reward according to his
own labor.
9 For we are God's co-workers. You are
God's ﬁeld, God's building.
10 According to God's grace that was
given to me, as a skilled master builder
I have laid a founda on, and another
builds on it. But each one must be
careful how he builds on it,
11 because no one can lay any other
founda on than what has been laid--that
is, Jesus Christ.
12 If anyone builds on the founda on
with gold, silver, costly stones, wood,
hay, or straw,
13 each one's work will become obvious,
for the day will disclose it, because it will
be revealed by ﬁre; the ﬁre will test the
quality of each one's work.
14 If anyone's work that he has built
survives, he will receive a reward.1 CORINTHIANS 3
11
15 If anyone's work is burned up, it will
be lost, but he will be saved; yet it will
be like an escape through ﬁre.
16 Don't you know that you are God's
sanctuary and that the Spirit of God lives
in you?
17 If anyone ruins God's sanctuary, God
will ruin him; for God's sanctuary is holy,
and that is what you are.
18 No one should deceive himself. If
anyone among you thinks he is wise in
this age, he must become foolish so that
he can become wise.
19 For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God, since it is wri en:
He catches the wise in their cra iness --
20 and again, The Lord knows the
reasonings of the wise, that they are
fu le.
21 So no one should boast in men, for
all things are yours:1 CORINTHIANS 3 – 4
12
22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas
or the world or life or death or things
present or things to come--all are yours,
23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ
to God.
1 A person should consider us in
this way: as servants of Christ and
managers of God's mysteries.
2 In this regard, it is expected of
managers that each one be found
faithful.
3 It is of li le importance that I should
be evaluated by you or by a human
court. In fact, I don't even evaluate
myself.
4 For I am not conscious of anything
against myself, but I am not jus ﬁed by
this. The One who evaluates me is the
Lord.
5 Therefore don't judge anything
prematurely, before the Lord comes,
who will both bring to light what is
41 CORINTHIANS 4
13
hidden in darkness and reveal the
inten ons of the hearts. And then praise
will come to each one from God.
6 Now, brothers, I have applied these
things to myself and Apollos for your
beneﬁt, so that you may learn from us
the saying: "Nothing beyond what is
wri en." The purpose is that none of
you will be inﬂated with pride in favor of
one person over another.
7 For who makes you so superior? What
do you have that you didn't receive? If,
in fact, you did receive it, why do you
boast as if you hadn't received it?
8 Already you are full! Already you are
rich! You have begun to reign as kings
without us--and I wish you did reign, so
that we also could reign with you!
9 For I think God has displayed us,
the apostles, in last place, like men
condemned to die: we have become a1 CORINTHIANS 4
14
spectacle to the world and to angels and
to men.
10 We are fools for Christ, but you are
wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are
strong! You are dis nguished, but we are
dishonored!
11 Up to the present hour we are
both hungry and thirsty; we are poorly
clothed, roughly treated, homeless;
12 we labor, working with our own
hands. When we are reviled, we bless;
when we are persecuted, we endure it;
13 when we are slandered, we entreat.
We are, even now, like the world's
garbage, like the ﬁlth of all things.
14 I'm not wri ng this to shame you, but
to warn you as my dear children.
15 For you can have 10,000 instructors
in Christ, but you can't have many
fathers. Now I have fathered you in
Christ Jesus through the gospel.1 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
15
16 Therefore I urge you, be imitators of
me.
17 This is why I have sent to you
Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful
child in the Lord. He will remind you
about my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I
teach everywhere in every church.
18 Now some are inﬂated with pride, as
though I were not coming to you.
19 But I will come to you soon, if the
Lord wills, and I will know not the talk
but the power of those who are inﬂated
with pride.
20 For the kingdom of God is not in talk
but in power.
21 What do you want? Should I come to
you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of
gentleness?
1 It is widely reported that there is
sexual immorality among you, and
the kind of sexual immorality that is not
51 CORINTHIANS 5
16
even condoned among the Gen les--a
man is living with his father's wife.
2 And you are inﬂated with pride,
instead of ﬁlled with grief so that he
who has commi ed this act might be
removed from among you.
3 For though absent in body but present
in spirit, I have already decided about
him who has done this thing as though I
were present.
4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when
you are assembled, along with my spirit
and with the power of our Lord Jesus,
5 turn that one over to Satan for the
destruc on of the ﬂesh, so that his spirit
may be saved in the Day of the Lord.
6 Your boas ng is not good. Don't you
know that a li le yeast permeates the
whole batch of dough?
7 Clean out the old yeast so that you
may be a new batch, since you are1 CORINTHIANS 5
17
unleavened. For Christ our Passover has
been sacriﬁced.
8 Therefore, let us observe the feast,
not with old yeast, or with the yeast of
malice and evil, but with the unleavened
bread of sincerity and truth.
9 I wrote to you in a le er not to
associate with sexually immoral people--
10 by no means referring to this world's
immoral people, or to the greedy and
swindlers, or to idolaters; otherwise you
would have to leave the world.
11 But now I am wri ng you not to
associate with anyone who bears the
name of brother who is sexually immoral
or greedy, an idolater or a reviler, a
drunkard or a swindler. Do not even eat
with such a person.
12 For what is it to me to judge
outsiders? Do you not judge those who
are inside?1 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
18
13 But God judges outsiders. Put away
the evil person from among yourselves.
1 Does any of you who has a
complaint against someone dare go
to law before the unrighteous, and not
before the saints?
2 Or do you not know that the saints
will judge the world? And if the world
is judged by you, are you unworthy to
judge the smallest cases?
3 Do you not know that we will judge
angels--not to speak of things pertaining
to this life?
4 So if you have cases pertaining to this
life, do you select those who have no
standing in the church to judge?
5 I say this to your shame! Can it be that
there is not one wise person among you
who will be able to arbitrate between
his brothers?
6 Instead, brother goes to law against
brother, and that before unbelievers!
61 CORINTHIANS 6
19
7 Therefore, it is already a total defeat
for you that you have lawsuits against
one another. Why not rather put up with
injus ce? Why not rather be cheated?
8 Instead, you act unjustly and
cheat--and this to brothers!
9 Do you not know that the unjust will
not inherit God's kingdom? Do not be
deceived: no sexually immoral people,
idolaters, adulterers, male pros tutes,
homosexuals,
10 thieves, greedy people, drunkards,
revilers, or swindlers will inherit God's
kingdom.
11 Some of you were like this; but you
were washed, you were sanc ﬁed, you
were jus ﬁed in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
12 "Everything is permissible for me,"
but not everything is helpful. "Everything
is permissible for me," but I will not be
brought under the control of anything.1 CORINTHIANS 6
20
13 "Foods for the stomach and the
stomach for foods," but God will do
away with both of them. The body is not
for sexual immorality but for the Lord,
and the Lord for the body.
14 God raised up the Lord and will also
raise us up by His power.
15 Do you not know that your bodies are
the members of Christ? So should I take
the members of Christ and make them
members of a pros tute? Absolutely
not!
16 Do you not know that anyone joined
to a pros tute is one body with her? For
it says, The two will become one ﬂesh.
17 But anyone joined to the Lord is one
spirit with Him.
18 Flee from sexual immorality! "Every
sin a person can commit is outside the
body," but the person who is sexually
immoral sins against his own body.1 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
21
19 Do you not know that your body is
a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in
you, whom you have from God? You are
not your own,
20 for you were bought at a price;
therefore glorify God in your body.
1 About the things you wrote: "It is
good for a man not to have rela ons
with a woman."
2 But because of sexual immorality,
each man should have his own wife,
and each woman should have her own
husband.
3 A husband should fulﬁll his marital
duty to his wife, and likewise a wife to
her husband.
4 A wife does not have authority over
her own body, but her husband does.
Equally, a husband does not have
authority over his own body, but his wife
does.
71 CORINTHIANS 7
22
5 Do not deprive one another--except
when you agree, for a me, to devote
yourselves to prayer. Then come
together again; otherwise, Satan may
tempt you because of your lack of
self-control.
6 I say this as a concession, not as a
command.
7 I wish that all people were just like
me. But each has his own gi from God,
one this and another that.
8 I say to the unmarried and to widows:
It is good for them if they remain as I am.
9 But if they do not have self-control,
they should marry, for it is be er to
marry than to burn with desire.
10 I command the married--not I, but
the Lord--a wife is not to leave her
husband.
11 But if she does leave, she must
remain unmarried or be reconciled to1 CORINTHIANS 7
23
her husband--and a husband is not to
leave his wife.
12 But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If
any brother has an unbelieving wife, and
she is willing to live with him, he must
not leave her.
13 Also, if any woman has an unbelieving
husband, and he is willing to live with
her, she must not leave her husband.
14 For the unbelieving husband
is sanc ﬁed by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanc ﬁed by the
Chris an husband. Otherwise your
children would be unclean, but now they
are holy.
15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let him
leave. A brother or a sister is not bound
in such cases. God has called you to
peace.
16 For you, wife, how do you know
whether you will save your husband?1 CORINTHIANS 7
24
Or you, husband, how do you know
whether you will save your wife?
17 However, each one must live his life
in the situa on the Lord assigned when
God called him. This is what I command
in all the churches.
18 Was anyone already circumcised
when he was called? He should not undo
his circumcision. Was anyone called
while uncircumcised? He should not get
circumcised.
19 Circumcision does not ma er and
uncircumcision does not ma er, but
keeping God's commandments does.
20 Each person should remain in the life
situa on in which he was called.
21 Were you called while a slave? It
should not be a concern to you. But if
you can become free, by all means take
the opportunity.
22 For he who is called by the Lord as
a slave is the Lord's freedman. Likewise1 CORINTHIANS 7
25
he who is called as a free man is Christ's
slave.
23 You were bought at a price; do not
become slaves of men.
24 Brothers, each person should remain
with God in whatever situa on he was
called.
25 About virgins: I have no command
from the Lord, but I do give an opinion
as one who by the Lord's mercy is
trustworthy.
26 Therefore I consider this to be good
because of the present distress: it is ﬁne
for a man to stay as he is.
27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not
seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a
wife? Do not seek a wife.
28 However, if you do get married, you
have not sinned, and if a virgin marries,
she has not sinned. But such people will
have trouble in this life, and I am trying
to spare you.1 CORINTHIANS 7
29 And I say this, brothers: the
26
me is
limited, so from now on those who have
wives should be as though they had
none,
30 those who weep as though they did
not weep, those who rejoice as though
they did not rejoice, those who buy as
though they did not possess,
31 and those who use the world as
though they did not make full use of
it. For this world in its current form is
passing away.
32 I want you to be without concerns.
An unmarried man is concerned about
the things of the Lord--how he may
please the Lord.
33 But a married man is concerned
about the things of the world--how he
may please his wife--
34 and he is divided. An unmarried
woman or a virgin is concerned about
the things of the Lord, so that she may1 CORINTHIANS 7
27
be holy both in body and in spirit. But a
married woman is concerned about the
things of the world--how she may please
her husband.
35 Now I am saying this for your own
beneﬁt, not to put a restraint on you, but
because of what is proper, and so that
you may be devoted to the Lord without
distrac on.
36 But if any man thinks he is ac ng
improperly toward his virgin, if she is
past marriageable age, and so it must
be, he can do what he wants. He is not
sinning; they can get married.
37 But he who stands ﬁrm in his heart
(who is under no compulsion, but has
control over his own will) and has
decided in his heart to keep his own
virgin, will do well.
38 So then he who marries his virgin
does well, but he who does not marry
will do be er.1 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
28
39 A wife is bound as long as her
husband is living. But if her husband
dies, she is free to be married to anyone
she wants--only in the Lord.
40 But she is happier if she remains as
she is, in my opinion. And I think that I
also have the Spirit of God.
1 About food oﬀered to idols: We
know that "we all have knowledge."
Knowledge inﬂates with pride, but love
builds up.
2 If anyone thinks he knows anything,
he does not yet know it as he ought to
know it.
3 But if anyone loves God, he is known
by Him.
4 About ea ng food oﬀered to idols,
then, we know that "an idol is nothing
in the world," and that "there is no God
but one."
81 CORINTHIANS 8
29
5 For even if there are so-called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth--as there
are many "gods" and many "lords"--
6 yet for us there is one God, the Father,
from whom are all things, and we for
Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
whom are all things, and we through
Him.
7 However, not everyone has this
knowledge. In fact, some have been so
used to idolatry up un l now, that when
they eat food oﬀered to an idol, their
conscience, being weak, is deﬁled.
8 Food will not make us acceptable to
God. We are not inferior if we don't eat,
and we are not be er if we do eat.
9 But be careful that this right of yours
in no way becomes a stumbling block to
the weak.
10 For if somebody sees you, the one
who has this knowledge, dining in an
idol's temple, won't his weak conscience1 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
30
be encouraged to eat food oﬀered to
idols?
11 Then the weak person, the brother
for whom Christ died, is ruined by your
knowledge.
12 Now when you sin like this against
the brothers and wound their weak
conscience, you are sinning against
Christ.
13 Therefore, if food causes my brother
to fall, I will never again eat meat, so
that I won't cause my brother to fall.
1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle?
Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are
you not my work in the Lord?
2 If I am not an apostle to others, at
least I am to you, for you are the seal of
my apostleship in the Lord.
3 My defense to those who examine me
is this:
4 Don't we have the right to eat and
drink?
91 CORINTHIANS 9
31
5 Don't we have the right to be
accompanied by a Chris an wife, like the
other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and
Cephas?
6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have
no right to refrain from working?
7 Who ever goes to war at his own
expense? Who plants a vineyard and
does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds
a ﬂock and does not drink the milk from
the ﬂock?
8 Am I saying this from a human
perspec ve? Doesn't the law also say
the same thing?
9 For it is wri en in the law of Moses,
Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out
the grain. Is God really concerned with
oxen?
10 Or isn't He really saying it for us? Yes,
this is wri en for us, because he who
plows ought to plow in hope, and he1 CORINTHIANS 9
32
who threshes should do so in hope of
sharing the crop.
11 If we have sown spiritual things for
you, is it too much if we reap material
things from you?
12 If others share this authority over
you, don't we even more? However, we
have not used this authority; instead we
endure everything so that we will not
hinder the gospel of Christ.
13 Do you not know that those who
perform the temple services eat the
food from the temple, and those who
serve at the altar share in the oﬀerings
of the altar?
14 In the same way, the Lord has
commanded that those who preach the
gospel should earn their living by the
gospel.
15 But I have used none of these rights,
and I have not wri en this to make it
happen that way for me. For it would be1 CORINTHIANS 9
33
be er for me to die than for anyone to
deprive me of my boast!
16 For if I preach the gospel, I have no
reason to boast, because an obliga on is
placed on me. And woe to me if I do not
preach the gospel!
17 For if I do this willingly, I have a
reward; but if unwillingly, I am entrusted
with a stewardship.
18 What then is my reward? To preach
the gospel and oﬀer it free of charge,
and not make full use of my authority in
the gospel.
19 For although I am free from all
people, I have made myself a slave to all,
in order to win more people.
20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to
win Jews; to those under the law, like
one under the law--though I myself am
not under the law--to win those under
the law.1 CORINTHIANS 9
34
21 To those who are outside the law, like
one outside the law--not being outside
God's law, but under the law of Christ--to
win those outside the law.
22 To the weak I became weak, in order
to win the weak. I have become all things
to all people, so that I may by all means
save some.
23 Now I do all this because of the
gospel, that I may become a partner in
its beneﬁts.
24 Do you not know that the runners in
a stadium all race, but only one receives
the prize? Run in such a way that you
may win.
25 Now everyone who competes
exercises self-control in everything.
However, they do it to receive
a perishable crown, but we an
imperishable one.1 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
35
26 Therefore I do not run like one who
runs aimlessly, or box like one who beats
the air.
27 Instead, I discipline my body and
bring it under strict control, so that a er
preaching to others, I myself will not be
disqualiﬁed.
1 Now I want you to know,
brothers, that our fathers were all
under the cloud, all passed through the
sea,
2 and all were bap zed into Moses in
the cloud and in the sea.
3 They all ate the same spiritual food,
4 and all drank the same spiritual drink.
For they drank from a spiritual rock that
followed them, and that rock was Christ.
5 But God was not pleased with most of
them, for they were struck down in the
desert.
101 CORINTHIANS 10
36
6 Now these things became examples
for us, so that we will not desire evil as
they did.
7 Don't become idolaters as some of
them were; as it is wri en, The people
sat down to eat and drink, and got up to
play.
8 Let us not commit sexual immorality
as some of them did, and in a single day
23,000 people fell dead.
9 Let us not tempt Christ as some of
them did, and were destroyed by snakes.
10 Nor should we complain as some
of them did, and were killed by the
destroyer.
11 Now these things happened to them
as examples, and they were wri en as a
warning to us, on whom the ends of the
ages have come.
12 Therefore, whoever thinks he stands
must be careful not to fall!1 CORINTHIANS 10
13 No tempta
37
on has overtaken you
except what is common to humanity.
God is faithful and He will not allow you
to be tempted beyond what you are
able, but with the tempta on He will
also provide a way of escape, so that you
are able to bear it.
14 Therefore, my dear friends, ﬂee from
idolatry.
15 I am speaking as to wise people.
Judge for yourselves what I say.
16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it
not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The
bread that we break, is it not a sharing
in the body of Christ?
17 Because there is one bread, we who
are many are one body, for all of us share
that one bread.
18 Look at the people of Israel. Are not
those who eat the sacriﬁces partners in
the altar?1 CORINTHIANS 10
38
19 What am I saying then? That food
oﬀered to idols is anything, or that an
idol is anything?
20 No, but I do say that what they
sacriﬁce, they sacriﬁce to demons and
not to God. I do not want you to be
partners with demons!
21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons. You cannot
share in the Lord's table and the table of
demons.
22 Or are we provoking the Lord to
jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
23 "Everything is permissible," but not
everything is helpful. "Everything is
permissible," but not everything builds
up.
24 No one should seek his own good ,
but the good of the other person.
25 Eat everything that is sold in the
meat market, asking no ques ons for
conscience' sake, for1 CORINTHIANS 10
39
26 the earth is the Lord's, and all that is
in it.
27 If one of the unbelievers invites you
over and you want to go, eat everything
that is set before you, without raising
ques ons of conscience.
28 But if someone says to you, "This is
food oﬀered to an idol," do not eat it,
out of considera on for the one who
told you, and for conscience' sake.
29 I do not mean your own conscience,
but the other person's. For why is my
freedom judged by another person's
conscience?
30 If I partake with thanks, why am I
slandered because of something for
which I give thanks?
31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink,
or whatever you do, do everything for
God's glory.
32 Give no oﬀense to the Jews or the
Greeks or the church of God,1 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
40
33 just as I also try to please all people
in all things, not seeking my own proﬁt,
but the proﬁt of many, that they may be
saved.
1 Be imitators of me, as I also am
of Christ.
2 Now I praise you because you
remember me in all things and keep the
tradi ons just as I delivered them to you.
3 But I want you to know that Christ is
the head of every man, and the man is
the head of the woman, and God is the
head of Christ.
4 Every man who prays or prophesies
with something on his head dishonors
his head.
5 But every woman who prays or
prophesies with her head uncovered
dishonors her head, since that is one and
the same as having her head shaved.
6 So if a woman's head is not covered,
her hair should be cut oﬀ. But if it is
111 CORINTHIANS 11
41
disgraceful for a woman to have her hair
cut oﬀ or her head shaved, she should
be covered.
7 A man, in fact, should not cover his
head, because he is God's image and
glory, but woman is man's glory.
8 For man did not come from woman,
but woman came from man;
9 and man was not created for woman,
but woman for man.
10 This is why a woman should have
a symbol of authority on her head:
because of the angels.
11 However, in the Lord, woman is not
independent of man, and man is not
independent of woman.
12 For just as woman came from man,
so man comes through woman, and all
things come from God.
13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for
a woman to pray to God with her head
uncovered?1 CORINTHIANS 11
42
14 Does not even nature itself teach you
that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace
to him,
15 but that if a woman has long hair, it
is her glory? For her hair is given to her
as a covering.
16 But if anyone wants to argue about
this, we have no other custom, nor do
the churches of God.
17 Now in giving the following
instruc on I do not praise you, since you
come together not for the be er but for
the worse.
18 For, to begin with, I hear that when
you come together as a church there
are divisions among you, and in part I
believe it.
19 There must, indeed, be fac ons
among you, so that the approved among
you may be recognized.1 CORINTHIANS 11
43
20 Therefore when you come together
in one place, it is not really to eat the
Lord's Supper.
21 For in ea ng, each one takes his own
supper ahead of others, and one person
is hungry while another is drunk!
22 Don't you have houses to eat and
drink in? Or do you look down on the
church of God and embarrass those who
have nothing? What should I say to you?
Should I praise you? I do not praise you
for this!
23 For I received from the Lord what I
also passed on to you: on the night when
He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took
bread,
24 gave thanks, broke it, and said, "This
is My body, which is for you. Do this in
remembrance of Me."
25 In the same way He also took the
cup, a er supper, and said, "This cup is
the new covenant in My blood. Do this,1 CORINTHIANS 11
44
as o en as you drink it, in remembrance
of Me."
26 For as o en as you eat this bread and
drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's
death un l He comes.
27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or
drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy
way will be guilty of sin against the body
and blood of the Lord.
28 So a man should examine himself; in
this way he should eat of the bread and
drink of the cup.
29 For whoever eats and drinks without
recognizing the body, eats and drinks
judgment on himself.
30 This is why many are sick and ill
among you, and many have fallen asleep.
31 If we were properly evalua ng
ourselves, we would not be judged,
32 but when we are judged, we are
disciplined by the Lord, so that we may
not be condemned with the world.1 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
45
33 Therefore, my brothers, when you
come together to eat, wait for one
another.
34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at
home, so that you can come together
and not cause judgment. And I will give
instruc ons about the other ma ers
whenever I come.
1 About ma ers of the spirit:
brothers, I do not want you to be
unaware.
2 You know how, when you were pagans,
you were led to dumb idols--being led
astray.
3 Therefore I am informing you that no
one speaking by the Spirit of God says,
"Jesus is cursed," and no one can say,
"Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
4 Now there are diﬀerent gi s, but the
same Spirit.
5 There are diﬀerent ministries, but the
same Lord.
121 CORINTHIANS 12
6 And there are diﬀerent ac
46
vi es, but
the same God is ac ve in everyone and
everything.
7 A manifesta on of the Spirit is given
to each person to produce what is
beneﬁcial:
8 to one is given a message of wisdom
through the Spirit, to another, a message
of knowledge by the same Spirit,
9 to another, faith by the same Spirit,
to another, gi s of healing by the one
Spirit,
10 to another, the performing of
miracles, to another, prophecy, to
another, dis nguishing between spirits,
to another, diﬀerent kinds of languages,
to another, interpreta on of languages.
11 But one and the same Spirit is ac ve
in all these, distribu ng to each one as
He wills.
12 For as the body is one and has many
parts, and all the parts of that body,1 CORINTHIANS 12
47
though many, are one body--so also is
Christ.
13 For we were all bap zed by one Spirit
into one body--whether Jews or Greeks,
whether slaves or free--and we were all
made to drink of one Spirit.
14 So the body is not one part but many.
15 If the foot should say, "Because I'm
not a hand, I don't belong to the body,"
in spite of this it s ll belongs to the body.
16 And if the ear should say, "Because
I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the
body," in spite of this it s ll belongs to
the body.
17 If the whole body were an eye, where
would the hearing be? If the whole were
an ear, where would be the sense of
smell?
18 But now God has placed the parts,
each one of them, in the body just as He
wanted.1 CORINTHIANS 12
48
19 And if they were all the same part,
where would the body be?
20 Now there are many parts, yet one
body.
21 So the eye cannot say to the hand, "I
don't need you!" nor again the head to
the feet, "I don't need you!"
22 On the contrary, all the more, those
parts of the body that seem to be weaker
are necessary.
23 And those parts of the body that
we think to be less honorable, we
clothe these with greater honor, and
our unpresentable parts have a be er
presenta on.
24 But our presentable parts have no
need of clothing . Instead, God has put
the body together, giving greater honor
to the less honorable,
25 so that there would be no division in
the body, but that the members would
have the same concern for each other.1 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
49
26 So if one member suﬀers, all the
members suﬀer with it; if one member is
honored, all the members rejoice with it.
27 Now you are the body of Christ, and
individual members of it.
28 And God has placed these in the
church: ﬁrst apostles, second prophets,
third teachers, next, miracles, then gi s
of healing, helping, managing, various
kinds of languages.
29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets?
Are all teachers? Do all do miracles?
30 Do all have gi s of healing? Do all
speak in languages? Do all interpret?
31 But desire the greater gi s. And I will
show you an even be er way.
1 If I speak the languages of men
and of angels, but do not have
love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging
cymbal.
2 If I have the gi of prophecy, and
understand all mysteries and all
131 CORINTHIANS 13
50
knowledge, and if I have all faith, so that
I can move mountains, but do not have
love, I am nothing.
3 And if I donate all my goods to feed
the poor, and if I give my body to be
burned, but do not have love, I gain
nothing.
4 Love is pa ent; love is kind. Love
does not envy; is not boas ul; is not
conceited;
5 does not act improperly; is not selﬁsh;
is not provoked; does not keep a record
of wrongs;
6 ﬁnds no joy in unrighteousness, but
rejoices in the truth;
7 bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.
8 Love never ends. But as for
prophecies, they will come to an end;
as for languages, they will cease; as for
knowledge, it will come to an end.1 CORINTHIANS 13 – 14
51
9 For we know in part, and we prophesy
in part.
10 But when the perfect comes, the
par al will come to an end.
11 When I was a child, I spoke like a
child, I thought like a child, I reasoned
like a child. When I became a man, I put
aside childish things.
12 For now we see indis nctly, as in a
mirror, but then face to face. Now I know
in part, but then I will know fully, as I am
fully known.
13 Now these three remain: faith, hope,
and love. But the greatest of these is
love.
1 Pursue love and desire spiritual
gi s, and above all that you may
prophesy.
2 For the person who speaks in another
language is not speaking to men but
to God, since no one understands him;
141 CORINTHIANS 14
52
however, he speaks mysteries in the
Spirit.
3 But the person who prophesies
speaks to people for ediﬁca on,
encouragement, and consola on.
4 The person who speaks in another
language builds himself up, but he who
prophesies builds up the church.
5 I wish all of you spoke in other
languages, but even more that you
prophesied. The person who prophesies
is greater than the person who speaks in
languages, unless he interprets so that
the church may be built up.
6 But now, brothers, if I come to you
speaking in other languages, how will I
beneﬁt you unless I speak to you with a
revela on or knowledge or prophecy or
teaching?
7 Even inanimate things producing
sounds--whether ﬂute or harp--if they
don't make a dis nc on in the notes,1 CORINTHIANS 14
53
how will what is played on the ﬂute or
harp be recognized?
8 In fact, if the trumpet makes an
unclear sound, who will prepare for
ba le?
9 In the same way, unless you use your
tongue for intelligible speech, how will
what is spoken be known? For you will
be speaking into the air.
10 There are doubtless many diﬀerent
kinds of languages in the world, and all
have meaning.
11 Therefore, if I do not know the
meaning of the language, I will be a
foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker
will be a foreigner to me.
12 So also you--since you are zealous
in ma ers of the spirit, seek to excel in
building up the church.
13 Therefore the person who speaks in
another language should pray that he
can interpret.1 CORINTHIANS 14
54
14 For if I pray in another language, my
spirit prays, but my understanding is
unfrui ul.
15 What then? I will pray with the
spirit, and I will also pray with my
understanding. I will sing with the
spirit, and I will also sing with my
understanding.
16 Otherwise, if you bless with the
spirit, how will the uninformed person
say "Amen" at your giving of thanks,
since he does not know what you are
saying?
17 For you may very well be giving
thanks, but the other person is not being
built up.
18 I thank God that I speak in other
languages more than all of you;
19 yet in the church I would rather speak
ﬁve words with my understanding, in
order to teach others also, than 10,000
words in another language.1 CORINTHIANS 14
55
20 Brothers, don't be childish in your
thinking, but be infants in evil and adult
in your thinking.
21 It is wri en in the law: By people
of other languages and by the lips of
foreigners, I will speak to this people;
and even then, they will not listen to Me,
says the Lord.
22 It follows that speaking in other
languages is intended as a sign, not
to believers but to unbelievers. But
prophecy is not for unbelievers but for
believers.
23 Therefore if the whole church
assembles together, and all are speaking
in other languages, and people who are
uninformed or unbelievers come in, will
they not say that you are out of your
minds?
24 But if all are prophesying, and some
unbeliever or uninformed person comes1 CORINTHIANS 14
56
in, he is convicted by all and is judged by
all.
25 The secrets of his heart will be
revealed, and as a result he will fall
down on his face and worship God,
proclaiming, "God is really among you."
26 How is it then, brothers? Whenever
you come together, each one has a
psalm, a teaching, a revela on, another
language, or an interpreta on. All things
must be done for ediﬁca on.
27 If any person speaks in another
language, there should be only two, or
at the most three, each in turn, and
someone must interpret.
28 But if there is no interpreter, that
person should keep silent in the church
and speak to himself and to God.
29 Two or three prophets should speak,
and the others should evaluate.1 CORINTHIANS 14
57
30 But if something has been revealed
to another person si ng there, the ﬁrst
prophet should be silent.
31 For you can all prophesy one by
one, so that everyone may learn and
everyone may be encouraged.
32 And the prophets' spirits are under
the control of the prophets,
33 since God is not a God of disorder
but of peace. As in all the churches of
the saints,
34 the women should be silent in the
churches, for they are not permi ed to
speak, but should be submissive, as the
law also says.
35 And if they want to learn something,
they should ask their own husbands at
home, for it is disgraceful for a woman
to speak in the church mee ng.
36 Did the word of God originate from
you, or did it come to you only?1 CORINTHIANS 14 – 15
58
37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or
spiritual, he should recognize that what I
write to you is the Lord's command.
38 But if anyone ignores this, he will be
ignored.
39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to
prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in
other languages.
40 But everything must be done
decently and in order.
1 Now brothers, I want to clarify
for you the gospel I proclaimed to
you; you received it and have taken your
stand on it.
2 You are also saved by it, if you hold to
the message I proclaimed to you--unless
you believed to no purpose.
3 For I passed on to you as most
important what I also received: that
Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures,
151 CORINTHIANS 15
59
4 that He was buried, that He was
raised on the third day according to the
Scriptures,
5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then
to the Twelve.
6 Then He appeared to over 500
brothers at one me, most of whom
remain to the present, but some have
fallen asleep.
7 Then He appeared to James, then to
all the apostles.
8 Last of all, as to one abnormally born,
He also appeared to me.
9 For I am the least of the apostles,
unworthy to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God.
10 But by God's grace I am what I
am, and His grace toward me was not
ineﬀec ve. However, I worked more
than any of them, yet not I, but God's
grace that was with me.1 CORINTHIANS 15
60
11 Therefore, whether it is I or they, so
we preach and so you have believed.
12 Now if Christ is preached as raised
from the dead, how can some of you say,
"There is no resurrec on of the dead"?
13 But if there is no resurrec on of the
dead, then Christ has not been raised;
14 and if Christ has not been raised, then
our preaching is without founda on,
and so is your faith.
15 In addi on, we are found to be false
witnesses about God, because we have
tes ﬁed about God that He raised up
Christ--whom He did not raise up if in
fact the dead are not raised.
16 For if the dead are not raised, Christ
has not been raised.
17 And if Christ has not been raised,
your faith is worthless; you are s ll in
your sins.
18 Therefore those who have fallen
asleep in Christ have also perished.1 CORINTHIANS 15
61
19 If we have placed our hope in Christ
for this life only, we should be pi ed
more than anyone.
20 But now Christ has been raised from
the dead, the ﬁrs ruits of those who
have fallen asleep.
21 For since death came through a man,
the resurrec on of the dead also comes
through a man.
22 For just as in Adam all die, so also in
Christ all will be made alive.
23 But each in his own order: Christ, the
ﬁrs ruits; a erward, at His coming, the
people of Christ.
24 Then comes the end, when He
hands over the kingdom to God the
Father, when He abolishes all rule and all
authority and power.
25 For He must reign un l He puts all His
enemies under His feet.
26 The last enemy to be abolished is
death.1 CORINTHIANS 15
62
27 For He has put everything under
His feet. But when it says "everything"
is put under Him, it is obvious that He
who puts everything under Him is the
excep on.
28 And when everything is subject to
Him, then the Son Himself will also be
subject to Him who subjected everything
to Him, so that God may be all in all.
29 Otherwise what will they do who are
being bap zed for the dead? If the dead
are not raised at all, then why are people
bap zed for them?
30 Why are we in danger every hour?
31 I aﬃrm by the pride in you that I have
in Christ Jesus our Lord: I die every day!
32 If I fought wild animals in Ephesus
with only human hope, what good does
that do me? If the dead are not raised,
Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we
die.1 CORINTHIANS 15

33 Do not be deceived: "Bad company
corrupts good morals."
34 Become right-minded and stop
sinning, because some people are
ignorant about God. I say this to your
shame.
35 But someone will say, "How are the
dead raised? What kind of body will they
have when they come?"
36 Foolish one! What you sow does not
come to life unless it dies.
37 And as for what you sow--you are not
sowing the future body, but only a seed,
perhaps of wheat or another grain.
38 But God gives it a body as He wants,
and to each of the seeds its own body.
39 Not all ﬂesh is the same ﬂesh; there
is one ﬂesh for humans, another for
animals, another for birds, and another
for ﬁsh.
40 There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies, but the splendor of the1 CORINTHIANS 15
64
heavenly bodies is diﬀerent from that of
the earthly ones.
41 There is a splendor of the sun,
another of the moon, and another of
the stars; for star diﬀers from star in
splendor.
42 So it is with the resurrec on of the
dead: Sown in corrup on, raised in
incorrup on;
43 sown in dishonor, raised in glory;
sown in weakness, raised in power;
44 sown a natural body, raised a spiritual
body. If there is a natural body, there is
also a spiritual body.
45 So it is wri en: The ﬁrst man Adam
became a living being ; the last Adam
became a life-giving Spirit.
46 However, the spiritual is not ﬁrst, but
the natural; then the spiritual.
47 The ﬁrst man was from the earth and
made of dust; the second man is from
heaven.1 CORINTHIANS 15
65
48 Like the man made of dust, so are
those who are made of dust; like the
heavenly man, so are those who are
heavenly.
49 And just as we have borne the image
of the man made of dust, we will also
bear the image of the heavenly man.
50 Brothers, I tell you this: ﬂesh and
blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God, and corrup on cannot inherit
incorrup on.
51 Listen! I am telling you a mystery: We
will not all fall asleep, but we will all be
changed,
52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet
will sound, and the dead will be raised
incorrup ble, and we will be changed.
53 Because this corrup ble must be
clothed with incorrup bility, and this
mortal must be clothed with immortality.1 CORINTHIANS 15 – 16
54 Now when this corrup
66
ble is clothed
with incorrup bility, and this mortal
is clothed with immortality, then the
saying that is wri en will take place:
Death has been swallowed up in victory.
55 O Death, where is your victory? O
Death, where is your s ng?
56 Now the s ng of death is sin, and the
power of sin is the law.
57 But thanks be to God, who gives
us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ!
58 Therefore, my dear brothers, be
steadfast, immovable, always excelling
in the Lord's work, knowing that your
labor in the Lord is not in vain.
1 Now about the collec on for the
saints: you should do the same as
I instructed the Gala an churches.
2 On the ﬁrst day of the week, each of
you is to set something aside and save to
the extent that he prospers, so that no
161 CORINTHIANS 16
67
collec ons will need to be made when I
come.
3 And when I arrive, I will send those
whom you recommend by le er to carry
your gracious gi to Jerusalem.
4 If it is also suitable for me to go, they
will travel with me.
5 I will come to you a er I pass through
Macedonia--for I will be traveling
through Macedonia--
6 and perhaps I will remain with you,
or even spend the winter, that you may
send me on my way wherever I go.
7 I don't want to see you now just in
passing, for I hope to spend some me
with you, if the Lord allows.
8 But I will stay in Ephesus un l
Pentecost,
9 because a wide door for eﬀec ve
ministry has opened for me--yet many
oppose me.1 CORINTHIANS 16
68
10 If Timothy comes, see that he has
nothing to fear from you, because he is
doing the Lord's work, just as I am.
11 Therefore no one should look down
on him; but you should send him on his
way in peace so he can come to me, for I
am expec ng him with the brothers.
12 About our brother Apollos: I strongly
urged him to come to you with the
brothers, but he was not at all willing to
come now. However, when he has me,
he will come.
13 Be alert, stand ﬁrm in the faith, be
brave and strong.
14 Your every ac on must be done with
love.
15 Brothers, you know the household
of Stephanas: they are the ﬁrs ruits of
Achaia and have devoted themselves to
serving the saints. I urge you1 CORINTHIANS 16
69
16 also to submit to such people, and
to everyone who works and labors with
them.
17 I am delighted over the presence of
Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus,
because these men have made up for
your absence.
18 For they have refreshed my spirit and
yours. Therefore recognize such people.
19 The churches of the Asian province
greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet
you hear ly in the Lord, along with the
church that meets in their home.
20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one
another with a holy kiss.
21 This gree ng is in my own hand--Paul.
22 If anyone does not love the Lord, a
curse be on him. Maranatha!
23 The grace of our Lord Jesus be with
you.
24 My love be with all of you in Christ
Jesus.2 Corinthians
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
God's will, and Timothy our brother:
To God's church at Corinth, with all the
saints who are throughout Achaia.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies
and the God of all comfort.
4 He comforts us in all our aﬄic on, so
that we may be able to comfort those
who are in any kind of aﬄic on, through
the comfort we ourselves receive from
God.
5 For as the suﬀerings of Christ overﬂow
to us, so our comfort overﬂows through
Christ.2 CORINTHIANS 1
2
6 If we are aﬄicted, it is for your comfort
and salva on; if we are comforted, it is
for your comfort, which is experienced
in the endurance of the same suﬀerings
that we suﬀer.
7 And our hope for you is ﬁrm, because
we know that as you share in the
suﬀerings, so you will share in the
comfort.
8 For we don't want you to be unaware,
brothers, of our aﬄic on that took
place in the province of Asia: we were
completely overwhelmed--beyond our
strength--so that we even despaired of
life.
9 However, we personally had a death
sentence within ourselves so that we
would not trust in ourselves, but in God
who raises the dead.
10 He has delivered us from such a
terrible death, and He will deliver us; we2 CORINTHIANS 1
3
have placed our hope in Him that He will
deliver us again.
11 And you can join in helping with
prayer for us, so that thanks may be
given by many on our behalf for the gi
that came to us through the prayers of
many.
12 For our boast is this: the tes mony of
our conscience that we have conducted
ourselves in the world, and especially
toward you, with God-given sincerity
and purity, not by ﬂeshly wisdom but by
God's grace.
13 Now we are wri ng you nothing
other than what you can read and also
understand. I hope you will understand
completely--
14 as you have par ally understood
us--that we are your reason for pride,
as you are ours, in the day of our Lord
Jesus.2 CORINTHIANS 1
4
15 In this conﬁdence, I planned to come
to you ﬁrst, so you could have a double
beneﬁt,
16 and to go on to Macedonia with
your help, then come to you again from
Macedonia and be given a start by you
on my journey to Judea.
17 So when I planned this, was I
irresponsible? Or what I plan, do I plan
in a purely human way so that I say "Yes,
yes" and "No, no" simultaneously ?
18 As God is faithful, our message to
you is not "Yes and no."
19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ,
who was preached among you by us--by
me and Silvanus and Timothy--did not
become "Yes and no"; on the contrary,
"Yes" has come about in Him.
20 For every one of God's promises is
"Yes" in Him. Therefore the "Amen" is
also through Him for God's glory through
us.2 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
5
21 Now the One who conﬁrms us with
you in Christ, and has anointed us, is
God;
22 He has also sealed us and given us
the Spirit as a down payment in our
hearts.
23 I call on God as a witness against me:
it was to spare you that I did not come
to Corinth.
24 Not that we have control of your
faith, but we are workers with you for
your joy, because you stand by faith.
1 In fact, I made up my mind about
this: not to come to you on another
painful visit.
2 For if I cause you pain, then who will
cheer me other than the one hurt?
3 I wrote this very thing so that when I
came I wouldn't have pain from those
who ought to give me joy, because I am
conﬁdent about all of you that my joy is
yours.
22 CORINTHIANS 2
6
4 For out of an extremely troubled and
anguished heart I wrote to you with
many tears--not that you should be hurt,
but that you should know the abundant
love I have for you.
5 If anyone has caused pain, he has
not caused pain to me, but in some
degree--not to exaggerate--to all of you.
6 The punishment by the majority is
suﬃcient for such a person,
7 so now you should forgive and
comfort him instead; otherwise, this one
may be overwhelmed by excessive grief.
8 Therefore I urge you to conﬁrm your
love to him.
9 It was for this purpose I wrote: so I
may know your proven character, if you
are obedient in everything.
10 Now to whom you forgive anything,
I do too. For what I have forgiven, if I
have forgiven anything, it is for you in
the presence of Christ,2 CORINTHIANS 2
7
11 so that we may not be taken
advantage of by Satan; for we are not
ignorant of his inten ons.
12 When I came to Troas for the gospel
of Christ, a door was opened to me by
the Lord.
13 I had no rest in my spirit because
I did not ﬁnd my brother Titus, but
I said good-bye to them and le for
Macedonia.
14 But thanks be to God, who always
puts us on display in Christ, and spreads
through us in every place the scent of
knowing Him.
15 For to God we are the fragrance of
Christ among those who are being saved
and among those who are perishing.
16 To some we are a scent of death
leading to death, but to others, a scent of
life leading to life. And who is competent
for this?2 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
8
17 For we are not like the many who
make a trade in God's message for proﬁt
, but as those with sincerity, we speak in
Christ, as from God and before God.
1 Are we beginning to commend
ourselves again? Or like some, do we
need le ers of recommenda on to you
or from you?
2 You yourselves are our le er, wri en
on our hearts, recognized and read by
everyone,
3 since it is plain that you are Christ's
le er, produced by us, not wri en with
ink but with the Spirit of the living God;
not on stone tablets but on tablets that
are hearts of ﬂesh.
4 We have this kind of conﬁdence
toward God through Christ:
5 not that we are competent in
ourselves to consider anything as coming
from ourselves, but our competence is
from God.
32 CORINTHIANS 3
9
6 He has made us competent to be
ministers of a new covenant, not of the
le er, but of the Spirit; for the le er kills,
but the Spirit produces life.
7 Now if the ministry of death, chiseled
in le ers on stones, came with glory, so
that the sons of Israel were not able to
look directly at Moses' face because of
the glory from his face--a fading glory --
8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not
be more glorious?
9 For if the ministry of condemna on
had glory, the ministry of righteousness
overﬂows with even more glory.
10 In fact, what had been glorious is not
glorious in this case because of the glory
that surpasses it.
11 For if what was fading away was
glorious, what endures will be even
more glorious.
12 Therefore having such a hope, we
use great boldness--2 CORINTHIANS 3
10
13 not like Moses, who used to put a veil
over his face so that the sons of Israel
could not look at the end of what was
fading away.
14 But their minds were closed. For
to this day, at the reading of the old
covenant, the same veil remains; it is
not li ed, because it is set aside only in
Christ.
15 However, to this day, whenever
Moses is read, a veil lies over their
hearts,
16 but whenever a person turns to the
Lord, the veil is removed.
17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
18 We all, with unveiled faces, are
reﬂec ng the glory of the Lord and are
being transformed into the same image
from glory to glory; this is from the Lord
who is the Spirit.2 CORINTHIANS 4
4
11
1 Therefore, since we have this
ministry, as we have received mercy,
we do not give up.
2 Instead, we have renounced shameful
secret things, not walking in deceit or
distor ng God's message, but in God's
sight we commend ourselves to every
person's conscience by an open display
of the truth.
3 But if, in fact, our gospel is veiled, it is
veiled to those who are perishing.
4 Regarding them: the god of this age
has blinded the minds of the unbelievers
so they cannot see the light of the gospel
of the glory of Christ, who is the image
of God.
5 For we are not proclaiming ourselves
but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves
as your slaves because of Jesus.
6 For God, who said, "Light shall shine
out of darkness"--He has shone in our2 CORINTHIANS 4
12
hearts to give the light of the knowledge
of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ.
7 Now we have this treasure in clay jars,
so that this extraordinary power may be
from God and not from us.
8 We are pressured in every way but
not crushed; we are perplexed but not in
despair;
9 we are persecuted but not abandoned;
we are struck down but not destroyed.
10 We always carry the death of Jesus in
our body, so that the life of Jesus may
also be revealed in our body.
11 For we who live are always given over
to death because of Jesus, so that Jesus'
life may also be revealed in our mortal
ﬂesh.
12 So death works in us, but life in you.
13 And since we have the same spirit of
faith in accordance with what is wri en,
I believed, therefore I spoke, we also
believe, and therefore speak,2 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
13
14 knowing that the One who raised the
Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus,
and present us with you.
15 For all this is because of you, so
that grace, extended through more and
more people, may cause thanksgiving to
overﬂow to God's glory.
16 Therefore we do not give up; even
though our outer person is being
destroyed, our inner person is being
renewed day by day.
17 For our momentary light aﬄic on
is producing for us an absolutely
incomparable eternal weight of glory.
18 So we do not focus on what is seen,
but on what is unseen; for what is seen is
temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
1 For we know that if our earthly
house, a tent, is destroyed, we have
a building from God, a house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens.
52 CORINTHIANS 5
14
2 And, in fact, we groan in this one,
longing to put on our house from
heaven,
3 since, when we are clothed, we will
not be found naked.
4 Indeed, we who are in this tent groan,
burdened as we are, because we do not
want to be unclothed but clothed, so
that mortality may be swallowed up by
life.
5 And the One who prepared us for this
very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit
as a down payment.
6 Therefore, though we are always
conﬁdent and know that while we are at
home in the body we are away from the
Lord--
7 for we walk by faith, not by sight--
8 yet we are conﬁdent and sa sﬁed to
be out of the body and at home with the
Lord.2 CORINTHIANS 5
15
9 Therefore, whether we are at home or
away, we make it our aim to be pleasing
to Him.
10 For we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ, so that each
may be repaid for what he has done in
the body, whether good or bad.
11 Knowing, then, the fear of the Lord,
we persuade people. We are completely
open before God, and I hope we are
completely open to your consciences as
well.
12 We are not commending ourselves to
you again, but giving you an opportunity
to be proud of us, so that you may have
a reply for those who take pride in the
outward appearance rather than in the
heart.
13 For if we are out of our mind, it is for
God; if we have a sound mind, it is for
you.2 CORINTHIANS 5
16
14 For Christ's love compels us, since
we have reached this conclusion: if One
died for all, then all died.
15 And He died for all so that those who
live should no longer live for themselves,
but for the One who died for them and
was raised.
16 From now on, then, we do not know
anyone in a purely human way. Even if
we have known Christ in a purely human
way, yet now we no longer know Him
like that.
17 Therefore if anyone is in Christ, there
is a new crea on; old things have passed
away, and look, new things have come.
18 Now everything is from God, who
reconciled us to Himself through
Christ and gave us the ministry of
reconcilia on:
19 that is, in Christ, God was reconciling
the world to Himself, not coun ng their
trespasses against them, and He has2 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
17
commi ed the message of reconcilia on
to us.
20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for
Christ; certain that God is appealing
through us, we plead on Christ's behalf,
"Be reconciled to God."
21 He made the One who did not know
sin to be sin for us, so that we might
become the righteousness of God in
Him.
1 Working together with Him, we
also appeal to you: "Don't receive
God's grace in vain."
2 For He says: In an acceptable me, I
heard you, and in the day of salva on, I
helped you. Look, now is the acceptable
me; look, now is the day of salva on.
3 We give no opportunity for stumbling
to anyone, so that the ministry will not
be blamed.
4 But in everything, as God's ministers,
we commend ourselves: by great
62 CORINTHIANS 6
18
endurance, by aﬄic ons, by hardship,
by pressures,
5 by bea ngs, by imprisonments, by
riots, by labors, by sleepless nights, by
mes of hunger,
6 by purity, by knowledge, by pa ence,
by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere
love,
7 by the message of truth, by the
power of God; through weapons of
righteousness on the right hand and the
le ,
8 through glory and dishonor, through
slander and good report; as deceivers
yet true;
9 as unknown yet recognized; as dying
and look--we live; as being chastened
yet not killed;
10 as grieving yet always rejoicing; as
poor yet enriching many; as having
nothing yet possessing everything.2 CORINTHIANS 6
19
11 We have spoken openly to you,
Corinthians; our heart has been opened
wide.
12 You are not limited by us, but you are
limited by your own aﬀec ons.
13 Now in like response--I speak as to
children--you also should be open to us.
14 Do not be mismatched with
unbelievers. For what partnership
is there between righteousness and
lawlessness? Or what fellowship does
light have with darkness?
15 What agreement does Christ have
with Belial? Or what does a believer
have in common with an unbeliever?
16 And what agreement does God's
sanctuary have with idols? For we are
the sanctuary of the living God, as God
said: I will dwell among them and walk
among them, and I will be their God, and
they will be My people.2 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
20
17 Therefore, come out from among
them and be separate, says the Lord; do
not touch any unclean thing, and I will
welcome you.
18 I will be a Father to you, and you will
be sons and daughters to Me, says the
Lord Almighty.
1 Therefore dear friends, since we
have such promises, we should wash
ourselves clean from every impurity
of the ﬂesh and spirit, making our
sanc ﬁca on complete in the fear of
God.
2 Take us into your hearts. We have
wronged no one, corrupted no one,
defrauded no one.
3 I don't say this to condemn you,
for I have already said that you are in
our hearts, to die together and to live
together.
4 I have great conﬁdence in you; I
have great pride in you. I am ﬁlled with
72 CORINTHIANS 7
21
encouragement; I am overcome with joy
in all our aﬄic ons.
5 In fact, when we came into
Macedonia, we had no rest. Instead, we
were aﬄicted in every way: struggles on
the outside, fears inside.
6 But God, who comforts the humble,
comforted us by the coming of Titus,
7 and not only by his coming, but also
by the comfort he received from you.
He announced to us your deep longing,
your sorrow, your zeal for me, so that I
rejoiced even more.
8 For although I grieved you with my
le er, I do not regret it--even though I
did regret it since I saw that the le er
grieved you, though only for a li le
while.
9 Now I am rejoicing, not because you
were grieved, but because your grief led
to repentance. For you were grieved as2 CORINTHIANS 7
22
God willed, so that you didn't experience
any loss from us.
10 For godly grief produces a repentance
not to be regre ed and leading to
salva on, but worldly grief produces
death.
11 For consider how much diligence
this very thing--this grieving as God
wills--has produced in you: what a desire
to clear yourselves, what indigna on,
what fear, what deep longing, what zeal,
what jus ce! In every way you have
commended yourselves to be pure in
this ma er.
12 So even though I wrote to you, it was
not because of the one who did wrong,
or because of the one who was wronged,
but in order that your diligence for us
might be made plain to you in the sight
of God.
13 For this reason we have been
comforted. In addi on to our comfort,2 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
23
we were made to rejoice even more over
the joy Titus had, because his spirit was
refreshed by all of you.
14 For if I have made any boast to him
about you, I have not been embarrassed;
but as I have spoken everything to you in
truth, so our boas ng to Titus has also
turned out to be the truth.
15 And his aﬀec on toward you is even
greater as he remembers the obedience
of all of you, and how you received him
with fear and trembling.
16 I rejoice that I have complete
conﬁdence in you.
1 We want you to know, brothers,
about the grace of God granted to
the churches of Macedonia:
2 during a severe tes ng by aﬄic on,
their abundance of joy and their deep
poverty overﬂowed into the wealth of
their generosity.
82 CORINTHIANS 8
3 I tes
24
fy that, on their own, according
to their ability and beyond their ability,
4 they begged us insistently for the
privilege of sharing in the ministry to the
saints,
5 and not just as we had hoped. Instead,
they gave themselves especially to the
Lord, then to us by God's will.
6 So we urged Titus that, just as he had
begun, so he should also complete this
grace to you.
7 Now as you excel in everything--in
faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all
diligence, and in your love for us--excel
also in this grace.
8 I am not saying this as a command.
Rather, by means of the diligence of
others, I am tes ng the genuineness of
your love.
9 For you know the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ: although He was rich, for2 CORINTHIANS 8
25
your sake He became poor, so that by
His poverty you might become rich.
10 Now I am giving an opinion on this
because it is proﬁtable for you, who a
year ago began not only to do something
but also to desire it.
11 But now ﬁnish the task as well, that
just as there was eagerness to desire it,
so there may also be a comple on from
what you have.
12 For if the eagerness is there, it is
acceptable according to what one has,
not according to what he does not have.
13 It is not that there may be relief for
others and hardship for you, but it is a
ques on of equality--
14 at the present me your surplus is
available for their need, so that their
abundance may also become available
for your need, that there may be
equality.2 CORINTHIANS 8
15 As it has been wri
26
en: The person
who gathered much did not have too
much, and the person who gathered
li le did not have too li le.
16 Thanks be to God who put the same
diligence for you into the heart of Titus.
17 For he accepted our urging and,
being very diligent, went out to you by
his own choice.
18 With him we have sent the brother
who is praised throughout the churches
for his gospel ministry.
19 And not only that, but he was
also appointed by the churches to
accompany us with this gi that is being
administered by us for the glory of the
Lord Himself and to show our eagerness
to help .
20 We are taking this precau on so no
one can ﬁnd fault with us concerning
this large sum administered by us.2 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
27
21 For we are making provision for what
is honorable, not only before the Lord
but also before men.
22 We have also sent with them our
brother whom we have o en tested,
in many circumstances, and found
diligent--and now even more diligent
because of his great conﬁdence in you.
23 As for Titus, he is my partner and
co-worker serving you; as for our
brothers, they are the messengers of the
churches, the glory of Christ.
24 Therefore, before the churches, show
them the proof of your love and of our
boas ng about you.
1 Now concerning the ministry to the
saints, it is unnecessary for me to
write to you.
2 For I know your eagerness, and I brag
about you to the Macedonians: "Achaia
has been prepared since last year," and
your zeal has s rred up most of them.
92 CORINTHIANS 9
3 But I sent the brothers so our boas
28
ng
about you in the ma er would not prove
empty, and so you would be prepared
just as I said.
4 For if any Macedonians should come
with me and ﬁnd you unprepared,
we, not to men on you, would be
embarrassed in that situa on.
5 Therefore I considered it necessary to
urge the brothers to go on ahead to you
and arrange in advance the generous gi
you promised, so that it will be ready as
a gi and not an extor on.
6 Remember this: the person who sows
sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the
person who sows generously will also
reap generously.
7 Each person should do as he has
decided in his heart--not out of regret or
out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful
giver.2 CORINTHIANS 9
29
8 And God is able to make every grace
overﬂow to you, so that in every way,
always having everything you need, you
may excel in every good work.
9 As it is wri en: He has sca ered; He
has given to the poor; His righteousness
endures forever.
10 Now the One who provides seed for
the sower and bread for food will provide
and mul ply your seed and increase the
harvest of your righteousness,
11 as you are enriched in every way
for all generosity, which produces
thanksgiving to God through us.
12 For the ministry of this service is not
only supplying the needs of the saints,
but is also overﬂowing in many acts of
thanksgiving to God.
13 Through the proof of this service,
they will glorify God for your obedience
to the confession of the gospel of Christ,2 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
30
and for your generosity in sharing with
them and with others.
14 And in their prayers for you they will
have deep aﬀec on for you because of
the surpassing grace of God on you.
15 Thanks be to God for His
indescribable gi .
1 Now I, Paul, make a personal
appeal to you by the gentleness
and graciousness of Christ--I who am
humble among you in person, but bold
toward you when absent.
2 I beg you that when I am present I will
not need to be bold with the conﬁdence
by which I plan to challenge certain
people who think we are walking in a
ﬂeshly way.
3 For although we are walking in the
ﬂesh, we do not wage war in a ﬂeshly
way,
4 since the weapons of our warfare are
not ﬂeshly, but are powerful through
102 CORINTHIANS 10
31
God for the demoli on of strongholds.
We demolish arguments
5 and every high-minded thing that
is raised up against the knowledge of
God, taking every thought cap ve to the
obedience of Christ.
6 And we are ready to punish any
disobedience, once your obedience is
complete.
7 Look at what is obvious. If anyone is
conﬁdent that he belongs to Christ, he
should remind himself of this: just as he
belongs to Christ, so do we.
8 For if I boast some more about our
authority, which the Lord gave for
building you up and not for tearing you
down, I am not ashamed.
9 I don't want to seem as though I am
trying to terrify you with my le ers.
10 For it is said, "His le ers are weighty
and powerful, but his physical presence2 CORINTHIANS 10
32
is weak, and his public speaking is
despicable."
11 Such a person should consider this:
what we are in the words of our le ers
when absent, we will be in ac ons when
present.
12 For we don't dare classify or
compare ourselves with some who
commend themselves. But in measuring
themselves by themselves and
comparing themselves to themselves,
they lack understanding.
13 We, however, will not boast beyond
measure, but according to the measure
of the area of ministry that God has
assigned to us, which reaches even to
you.
14 For we are not overextending
ourselves, as if we had not reached you,
since we have come to you with the
gospel of Christ.2 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
33
15 We are not bragging beyond measure
about other people's labors. But we have
the hope that as your faith increases, our
area of ministry will be greatly enlarged,
16 so that we may preach the gospel to
the regions beyond you, not boas ng
about what has already been done in
someone else's area of ministry .
17 So the one who boasts must boast in
the Lord.
18 For it is not the one commending
himself who is approved, but the one
the Lord commends.
1 I wish you would put up with a
li le foolishness from me. Yes, do
put up with me.
2 For I am jealous over you with a godly
jealousy, because I have promised you in
marriage to one husband--to present a
pure virgin to Christ.
3 But I fear that, as the serpent deceived
Eve by his cunning, your minds may be
112 CORINTHIANS 11
34
corrupted from a complete and pure
devo on to Christ.
4 For if a person comes and preaches
another Jesus, whom we did not preach,
or you receive a diﬀerent spirit, which
you had not received, or a diﬀerent
gospel, which you had not accepted, you
put up with it splendidly!
5 Now I consider myself in no way
inferior to the "super-apostles."
6 Though untrained in public speaking, I
am certainly not untrained in knowledge.
Indeed, we have always made that clear
to you in everything.
7 Or did I commit a sin by humbling
myself so that you might be exalted,
because I preached the gospel of God to
you free of charge?
8 I robbed other churches by taking pay
from them to minister to you.
9 When I was present with you and in
need, I did not burden anyone, for the2 CORINTHIANS 11
35
brothers who came from Macedonia
supplied my needs. I have kept myself,
and will keep myself, from burdening
you in any way.
10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this
boas ng of mine will not be stopped in
the regions of Achaia.
11 Why? Because I don't love you? God
knows I do!
12 But I will con nue to do what I am
doing, in order to cut oﬀ the opportunity
of those who want an opportunity to be
regarded just as we are in what they are
boas ng about.
13 For such people are false apostles,
decei ul workers, disguising themselves
as apostles of Christ.
14 And no wonder! For Satan himself is
disguised as an angel of light.
15 So it is no great thing if his servants
also disguise themselves as servants2 CORINTHIANS 11
36
of righteousness. Their des ny will be
according to their works.
16 I repeat: no one should consider me
a fool. But if you do , at least accept me
as a fool, so I too may boast a li le.
17 What I say in this ma er of boas ng,
I don't speak as the Lord would, but
foolishly.
18 Since many boast from a human
perspec ve, I will also boast.
19 For you gladly put up with fools since
you are so smart!
20 In fact, you put up with it if someone
enslaves you, if someone devours you,
if someone captures you, if someone
dominates you, or if someone hits you in
the face.
21 I say this to our shame: we have been
weak. But in whatever anyone dares to
boast --I am talking foolishly--I also dare:2 CORINTHIANS 11
37
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they
Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of
Abraham? So am I.
23 Are they servants of Christ? I'm
talking like a madman--I'm a be er
one: with far more labors, many more
imprisonments, far worse bea ngs, near
death many mes.
24 Five mes I received from the Jews
40 lashes minus one.
25 Three mes I was beaten with rods.
Once I was stoned. Three mes I was
shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a
day in the depths of the sea.
26 On frequent journeys, I faced
dangers from rivers, dangers from
robbers, dangers from my own people,
dangers from the Gen les, dangers in
the city, dangers in the open country,
dangers on the sea, and dangers among
false brothers;2 CORINTHIANS 11
38
27 labor and hardship, many sleepless
nights, hunger and thirst, o en without
food, cold, and lacking clothing.
28 Not to men on other things, there is
the daily pressure on me: my care for all
the churches.
29 Who is weak, and I am not weak?
Who is made to stumble, and I do not
burn with indigna on?
30 If boas ng is necessary, I will boast
about my weaknesses.
31 The eternally blessed One, the God
and Father of the Lord Jesus, knows I am
not lying.
32 In Damascus, the governor under
King Aretas guarded the city of the
Damascenes in order to arrest me,
33 so I was let down in a basket through
a window in the wall and escaped his
hands.2 CORINTHIANS 12
12
39
1 It is necessary to boast; it is
not helpful, but I will move on to
visions and revela ons of the Lord.
2 I know a man in Christ who was caught
up into the third heaven 14 years ago.
Whether he was in the body or out of
the body, I don't know; God knows.
3 I know that this man--whether in the
body or out of the body I do not know,
God knows--
4 was caught up into paradise. He heard
inexpressible words, which a man is not
allowed to speak.
5 I will boast about this person, but not
about myself, except of my weaknesses.
6 For if I want to boast, I will not be a
fool, because I will be telling the truth.
But I will spare you, so that no one can
credit me with something beyond what
he sees in me or hears from me,
7 especially because of the
extraordinary revela ons. Therefore, so2 CORINTHIANS 12
40
that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in
the ﬂesh was given to me, a messenger
of Satan to torment me so I would not
exalt myself.
8 Concerning this, I pleaded with the
Lord three mes to take it away from
me.
9 But He said to me, "My grace is
suﬃcient for you, for power is perfected
in weakness." Therefore, I will most
gladly boast all the more about my
weaknesses, so that Christ's power may
reside in me.
10 So because of Christ, I am pleased in
weaknesses, in insults, in catastrophes,
in persecu ons, and in pressures. For
when I am weak, then I am strong.
11 I have become a fool; you forced it on
me. I ought to have been recommended
by you, since I am in no way inferior to
the "super-apostles," even though I am
nothing.2 CORINTHIANS 12
41
12 The signs of an apostle were
performed among you in all endurance-
-not only signs but also wonders and
miracles.
13 So in what way were you treated
worse than the other churches, except
that I personally did not burden you?
Forgive me this wrong!
14 Look! I am ready to come to you this
third me. I will not burden you, for I
am not seeking what is yours, but you.
For children are not obligated to save up
for their parents, but parents for their
children.
15 I will most gladly spend and be spent
for you. If I love you more, am I to be
loved less?
16 Now granted, I have not burdened
you; yet sly as I am, I took you in by
deceit!
17 Did I take advantage of you by anyone
I sent you?2 CORINTHIANS 12
42
18 I urged Titus to come , and I sent
the brother with him. Did Titus take
advantage of you? Didn't we walk in the
same spirit and in the same footsteps?
19 You have thought all along that we
were defending ourselves to you. No ,
in the sight of God we are speaking in
Christ, and everything, dear friends, is
for building you up.
20 For I fear that perhaps when I come I
will not ﬁnd you to be what I want, and I
may not be found by you to be what you
want; there may be quarreling, jealousy,
outbursts of anger, selﬁsh ambi ons,
slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.
21 I fear that when I come my God will
again humiliate me in your presence,
and I will grieve for many who sinned
before and have not repented of the
uncleanness, sexual immorality, and
promiscuity they prac ced.2 CORINTHIANS 13
1 This is the third
43
me I am
coming to you. On the tes mony
of two or three witnesses every word
will be conﬁrmed.
2 I gave warning, and I give warning--as
when I was present the second me, so
now while I am absent--to those who
sinned before and to all the rest: if I
come again, I will not be lenient,
3 since you seek proof of Christ speaking
in me. He is not weak toward you, but
powerful among you.
4 In fact, He was cruciﬁed in weakness,
but He lives by God's power. For we also
are weak in Him, yet toward you we will
live with Him by God's power.
5 Test yourselves to see if you are in the
faith. Examine yourselves. Or do you not
recognize for yourselves that Jesus Christ
is in you?--unless you fail the test.
6 And I hope you will recognize that we
are not failing the test.
132 CORINTHIANS 13
44
7 Now we pray to God that you do
nothing wrong, not that we may appear
to pass the test, but that you may do
what is right, even though we may
appear to fail.
8 For we are not able to do anything
against the truth, but only for the truth.
9 In fact, we rejoice when we are weak
and you are strong. We also pray for this:
your maturity.
10 This is why I am wri ng these things
while absent, that when I am there I
will not use severity, in keeping with the
authority the Lord gave me for building
up and not for tearing down.
11 Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be restored,
be encouraged, be of the same mind, be
at peace, and the God of love and peace
will be with you.
12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.2 CORINTHIANS 13
45
13 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God, and the fellowship
of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.
14Gala ans
1
1 Paul, an apostle--not from men
or by man, but by Jesus Christ and
God the Father who raised Him from the
dead--
2 and all the brothers who are with me:
To the churches of Gala a.
3 Grace to you and peace from God the
Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
4 who gave Himself for our sins to
rescue us from this present evil age,
according to the will of our God and
Father,
5 to whom be the glory forever and
ever. Amen.
6 I am amazed that you are so quickly
turning away from Him who called you
by the grace of Christ, and are turning to
a diﬀerent gospel--GALATIANS 1
2
7 not that there is another gospel , but
there are some who are troubling you
and want to change the gospel of Christ.
8 But even if we or an angel from
heaven should preach to you a gospel
other than what we have preached to
you, a curse be on him!
9 As we have said before, I now say
again: if anyone preaches to you a gospel
contrary to what you received, a curse
be on him!
10 For am I now trying to win the favor
of people, or God? Or am I striving to
please people? If I were s ll trying to
please people, I would not be a slave of
Christ.
11 Now I want you to know, brothers,
that the gospel preached by me is not
based on a human point of view.
12 For I did not receive it from a human
source and I was not taught it, but it
came by a revela on from Jesus Christ.GALATIANS 1
3
13 For you have heard about my former
way of life in Judaism: I persecuted God's
church to an extreme degree and tried
to destroy it;
14 and I advanced in Judaism beyond
many contemporaries among my people,
because I was extremely zealous for the
tradi ons of my ancestors.
15 But when God, who from my
mother's womb set me apart and called
me by His grace, was pleased
16 to reveal His Son in me, so that I could
preach Him among the Gen les, I did
not immediately consult with anyone.
17 I did not go up to Jerusalem to those
who had become apostles before me;
instead I went to Arabia and came back
to Damascus.
18 Then a er three years I did go up to
Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I
stayed with him 15 days.GALATIANS 1 – 2
4
19 But I didn't see any of the other
apostles except James, the Lord's
brother.
20 Now in what I write to you, I'm not
lying. God is my witness.
21 A erwards, I went to the regions of
Syria and Cilicia.
22 I remained personally unknown to
the Judean churches in Christ;
23 they simply kept hearing: "He who
formerly persecuted us now preaches
the faith he once tried to destroy."
24 And they gloriﬁed God because of
me.
1 Then a er 14 years I went up again
to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking
Titus along also.
2 I went up because of a revela on and
presented to them the gospel I preach
among the Gen les--but privately to
those recognized as leaders --so that I
2GALATIANS 2
5
might not be running, or have run, in
vain.
3 But not even Titus who was with me,
though he was a Greek, was compelled
to be circumcised.
4 This issue arose because of false
brothers smuggled in, who came in
secretly to spy on our freedom that we
have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave
us.
5 But we did not yield in submission to
these people for even an hour, so that
the truth of the gospel would remain for
you.
6 But from those recognized as
important (what they really were makes
no diﬀerence to me; God does not
show favori sm)--those recognized as
important added nothing to me.
7 On the contrary, they saw that I had
been entrusted with the gospel for theGALATIANS 2
6
uncircumcised, just as Peter was for the
circumcised.
8 For He who was at work with Peter
in the apostleship to the circumcised
was also at work with me among the
Gen les.
9 When James, Cephas, and John,
recognized as pillars, acknowledged
the grace that had been given to me,
they gave the right hand of fellowship
to me and Barnabas, agreeing that we
should go to the Gen les and they to the
circumcised.
10 They asked only that we would
remember the poor, which I made every
eﬀort to do.
11 But when Cephas came to An och,
I opposed him to his face because he
stood condemned.
12 For he used to eat with the Gen les
before certain men came from James.
However, when they came, he withdrewGALATIANS 2
7
and separated himself, because he
feared those from the circumcision
party.
13 Then the rest of the Jews joined his
hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was
carried away by their hypocrisy.
14 But when I saw that they were
devia ng from the truth of the gospel, I
told Cephas in front of everyone, "If you,
who are a Jew, live like a Gen le and not
like a Jew, how can you compel Gen les
to live like Jews?"
15 We are Jews by birth and not "Gen le
sinners";
16 yet we know that no one is jus ﬁed
by the works of the law but by faith in
Jesus Christ. And we have believed in
Christ Jesus, so that we might be jus ﬁed
by faith in Christ and not by the works of
the law, because by the works of the law
no human being will be jus ﬁed.GALATIANS 2 – 3
17 But if, while seeking to be jus
8
ﬁed by
Christ, we ourselves are also found to be
sinners, is Christ then a promoter of sin?
Absolutely not!
18 If I rebuild those things that I tore
down, I show myself to be a lawbreaker.
19 For through the law I have died to
the law, that I might live to God. I have
been cruciﬁed with Christ;
20 and I no longer live, but Christ lives in
me. The life I now live in the ﬂesh, I live
by faith in the Son of God, who loved me
and gave Himself for me.
21 I do not set aside the grace of God;
for if righteousness comes through the
law, then Christ died for nothing.
1 You foolish Gala ans! Who has
hypno zed you, before whose eyes
Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as
cruciﬁed?
3GALATIANS 3
9
2 I only want to learn this from you: Did
you receive the Spirit by the works of
the law or by hearing with faith?
3 Are you so foolish? A er beginning
with the Spirit, are you now going to be
made complete by the ﬂesh?
4 Did you suﬀer so much for nothing--if
in fact it was for nothing?
5 So then, does God supply you with the
Spirit and work miracles among you by
the works of the law or by hearing with
faith?
6 Just as Abraham believed God, and it
was credited to him for righteousness,
7 so understand that those who have
faith are Abraham's sons.
8 Now the Scripture foresaw that God
would jus fy the Gen les by faith and
foretold the good news to Abraham,
saying, All the na ons will be blessed in
you.GALATIANS 3
10
9 So those who have faith are blessed
with Abraham, who had faith.
10 For all who rely on the works of the
law are under a curse, because it is
wri en: Cursed is everyone who does
not con nue doing everything wri en in
the book of the law.
11 Now it is clear that no one is jus ﬁed
before God by the law, because the
righteous will live by faith.
12 But the law is not based on faith;
instead, the one who does these things
will live by them.
13 Christ has redeemed us from the
curse of the law by becoming a curse
for us, because it is wri en: Cursed is
everyone who is hung on a tree.
14 The purpose was that the blessing of
Abraham would come to the Gen les in
Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the
promise of the Spirit through faith.GALATIANS 3
11
15 Brothers, I'm using a human
illustra on. No one sets aside even a
human covenant that has been ra ﬁed,
or makes addi ons to it.
16 Now the promises were spoken to
Abraham and to his seed. He does not
say "and to seeds," as though referring
to many, but and to your seed, referring
to one, who is Christ.
17 And I say this: the law, which came
430 years later, does not revoke a
covenant that was previously ra ﬁed by
God, so as to cancel the promise.
18 For if the inheritance is from the law,
it is no longer from the promise; but
God granted it to Abraham through the
promise.
19 Why the law then? It was added
because of transgressions un l the Seed
to whom the promise was made would
come. The law was ordered through
angels by means of a mediator.GALATIANS 3
12
20 Now a mediator is not for just one
person, but God is one.
21 Is the law therefore contrary to God's
promises? Absolutely not! For if a law
had been given that was able to give life,
then righteousness would certainly be
by the law.
22 But the Scripture has imprisoned
everything under sin's power, so that the
promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be
given to those who believe.
23 Before this faith came, we were
conﬁned under the law, imprisoned un l
the coming faith was revealed.
24 The law, then, was our guardian un l
Christ, so that we could be jus ﬁed by
faith.
25 But since that faith has come, we are
no longer under a guardian,
26 for you are all sons of God through
faith in Christ Jesus.GALATIANS 3 – 4
13
27 For as many of you as have been
bap zed into Christ have put on Christ.
28 There is no Jew or Greek, slave or
free, male or female; for you are all one
in Christ Jesus.
29 And if you are Christ's, then you are
Abraham's seed, heirs according to the
promise.
1 Now I say that as long as the heir
is a child, he diﬀers in no way from
a slave, though he is the owner of
everything.
2 Instead, he is under guardians and
stewards un l the me set by his father.
3 In the same way we also, when we
were children, were in slavery under the
elemental forces of the world.
4 But when the comple on of the
me came, God sent His Son, born of a
woman, born under the law,
5 to redeem those under the law, so
that we might receive adop on as sons.
4GALATIANS 4
14
6 And because you are sons, God has
sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,
crying, "Abba, Father!"
7 So you are no longer a slave, but a
son; and if a son, then an heir through
God.
8 But in the past, when you didn't know
God, you were enslaved to things that by
nature are not gods.
9 But now, since you know God, or
rather have become known by God, how
can you turn back again to the weak and
bankrupt elemental forces? Do you want
to be enslaved to them all over again?
10 You observe special days, months,
seasons, and years.
11 I am fearful for you, that perhaps my
labor for you has been wasted.
12 I beg you, brothers: become like me,
for I also became like you. You have not
wronged me;GALATIANS 4
15
13 you know that previously I preached
the gospel to you in physical weakness,
14 and though my physical condi on
was a trial for you, you did not despise or
reject me. On the contrary, you received
me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus
Himself .
15 What happened to this blessedness
of yours? For I tes fy to you that, if
possible, you would have torn out your
eyes and given them to me.
16 Have I now become your enemy by
telling you the truth?
17 They are enthusias c about you, but
not for any good. Instead, they want to
isolate you so you will be enthusias c
about them.
18 Now it is always good to be
enthusias c about good--and not just
when I am with you.GALATIANS 4
16
19 My children, again I am in the pains
of childbirth for you un l Christ is formed
in you.
20 I'd like to be with you right now and
change my tone of voice, because I don't
know what to do about you.
21 Tell me, you who want to be under
the law, don't you hear the law?
22 For it is wri en that Abraham had
two sons, one by a slave and the other
by a free woman.
23 But the one by the slave was born
according to the ﬂesh, while the one by
the free woman was born as the result
of a promise.
24 These things are illustra ons, for the
women represent the two covenants.
One is from Mount Sinai and bears
children into slavery--this is Hagar.
25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in
Arabia and corresponds to the presentGALATIANS 4
17
Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her
children.
26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and
she is our mother.
27 For it is wri en: Rejoice, O barren
woman who does not give birth. Break
forth and shout, you who are not in
labor, for the children of the desolate
are many, more numerous than those of
the woman who has a husband.
28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are
children of promise.
29 But just as then the child born
according to the ﬂesh persecuted the
one born according to the Spirit, so also
now.
30 But what does the Scripture say?
Throw out the slave and her son, for the
son of the slave will never inherit with
the son of the free woman.GALATIANS 4 – 5
18
31 Therefore, brothers, we are not
children of the slave but of the free
woman.
1 Christ has liberated us into
freedom. Therefore stand ﬁrm and
don't submit again to a yoke of slavery.
2 Take note! I, Paul, tell you that if you
get circumcised, Christ will not beneﬁt
you at all.
3 Again I tes fy to every man who gets
circumcised that he is obligated to keep
the en re law.
4 You who are trying to be jus ﬁed by
the law are alienated from Christ; you
have fallen from grace!
5 For by the Spirit we eagerly wait for
the hope of righteousness from faith.
6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
nor uncircumcision accomplishes
anything; what ma ers is faith working
through love.
5GALATIANS 5
19
7 You were running well. Who
prevented you from obeying the truth?
8 This persuasion did not come from
Him who called you.
9 A li le yeast leavens the whole lump
of dough.
10 In the Lord I have conﬁdence in you
that you will not accept any other view.
But whoever it is who is troubling you
will pay the penalty.
11 Now brothers, if I s ll preach
circumcision, why am I s ll persecuted?
In that case the oﬀense of the cross has
been abolished.
12 I wish those who are disturbing you
might also get themselves castrated!
13 For you are called to freedom,
brothers; only don't use this freedom as
an opportunity for the ﬂesh, but serve
one another through love.GALATIANS 5
14 For the en
20
re law is fulﬁlled in one
statement: You shall love your neighbor
as yourself.
15 But if you bite and devour one
another, watch out, or you will be
consumed by one another.
16 I say then, walk by the Spirit and you
will not carry out the desire of the ﬂesh.
17 For the ﬂesh desires what is against
the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is
against the ﬂesh; these are opposed to
each other, so that you don't do what
you want.
18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you
are not under the law.
19 Now the works of the ﬂesh are
obvious: sexual immorality, moral
impurity, promiscuity,
20 idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife,
jealousy, outbursts of anger, selﬁsh
ambi ons, dissensions, fac ons,GALATIANS 5 – 6
21
21 envy, drunkenness, carousing, and
anything similar, about which I tell you in
advance--as I told you before--that those
who prac ce such things will not inherit
the kingdom of God.
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, pa ence, kindness, goodness,
faith,
23 gentleness, self-control. Against such
things there is no law.
24 Now those who belong to Christ
Jesus have cruciﬁed the ﬂesh with its
passions and desires.
25 If we live by the Spirit, we must also
follow the Spirit.
26 We must not become conceited,
provoking one another, envying one
another.
1 Brothers, if someone is caught
in any wrongdoing, you who are
spiritual should restore such a person
with a gentle spirit, watching out for
6GALATIANS 6
22
yourselves so you won't be tempted
also.
2 Carry one another's burdens; in this
way you will fulﬁll the law of Christ.
3 For if anyone considers himself to be
something when he is nothing, he is
deceiving himself.
4 But each person should examine
his own work, and then he will have a
reason for boas ng in himself alone, and
not in respect to someone else.
5 For each person will have to carry his
own load.
6 The one who is taught the message
must share his goods with the teacher.
7 Don't be deceived: God is not mocked.
For whatever a man sows he will also
reap,
8 because the one who sows to his ﬂesh
will reap corrup on from the ﬂesh, but
the one who sows to the Spirit will reap
eternal life from the Spirit.GALATIANS 6
9 So we must not get
23
red of doing
good, for we will reap at the proper me
if we don't give up.
10 Therefore, as we have opportunity,
we must work for the good of all,
especially for those who belong to the
household of faith.
11 Look at what large le ers I have
wri en to you in my own handwri ng.
12 Those who want to make a good
showing in the ﬂesh are the ones who
would compel you to be circumcised--
but only to avoid being persecuted for
the cross of Christ.
13 For even the circumcised don't keep
the law themselves; however, they want
you to be circumcised in order to boast
about your ﬂesh.
14 But as for me, I will never boast
about anything except the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, through whom theGALATIANS 6
24
world has been cruciﬁed to me, and I to
the world.
15 For both circumcision and
uncircumcision mean nothing;
what ma ers instead is a new crea on.
16 May peace be on all those who follow
this standard, and mercy also be on the
Israel of God!
17 From now on, let no one cause me
trouble, because I carry the marks of
Jesus on my body.
18 Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with your spirit. Amen.Ephesians
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
God's will: To the saints and believers
in Christ Jesus at Ephesus.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
us with every spiritual blessing in the
heavens, in Christ;
4 for He chose us in Him, before the
founda on of the world, to be holy and
blameless in His sight. In love
5 He predes ned us to be adopted
through Jesus Christ for Himself,
according to His favor and will,
6 to the praise of His glorious grace that
He favored us with in the Beloved.EPHESIANS 1
7 In Him we have redemp
2
on through
His blood, the forgiveness of our
trespasses, according to the riches of His
grace
8 that He lavished on us with all wisdom
and understanding.
9 He made known to us the mystery of
His will, according to His good pleasure
that He planned in Him
10 for the administra on of the days of
fulﬁllment--to bring everything together
in the Messiah, both things in heaven
and things on earth in Him.
11 In Him we were also made His
inheritance, predes ned according to
the purpose of the One who works
out everything in agreement with the
decision of His will,
12 so that we who had already put our
hope in the Messiah might bring praise
to His glory.EPHESIANS 1
3
13 In Him you also, when you heard
the word of truth, the gospel of your
salva on--in Him when you believed-
-were sealed with the promised Holy
Spirit.
14 He is the down payment of our
inheritance, for the redemp on of the
possession, to the praise of His glory.
15 This is why, since I heard about your
faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for
all the saints,
16 I never stop giving thanks for you as I
remember you in my prayers.
17 I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the glorious Father, would give
you a spirit of wisdom and revela on in
the knowledge of Him.
18 I pray that the eyes of your heart may
be enlightened so you may know what
is the hope of His calling, what are the
glorious riches of His inheritance among
the saints,EPHESIANS 1 – 2
4
19 and what is the immeasurable
greatness of His power to us who
believe, according to the working of His
vast strength.
20 He demonstrated this power in the
Messiah by raising Him from the dead
and sea ng Him at His right hand in the
heavens--
21 far above every ruler and authority,
power and dominion, and every tle
given, not only in this age but also in the
one to come.
22 And He put everything under His
feet and appointed Him as head over
everything for the church,
23 which is His body, the fullness of the
One who ﬁlls all things in every way.
1 And you were dead in your
trespasses and sins
2 in which you previously walked
according to this worldly age, according
to the ruler of the atmospheric
2EPHESIANS 2
5
domain, the spirit now working in the
disobedient.
3 We too all previously lived among
them in our ﬂeshly desires, carrying
out the inclina ons of our ﬂesh and
thoughts, and by nature we were
children under wrath, as the others were
also.
4 But God, who is abundant in mercy,
because of His great love that He had for
us,
5 made us alive with the Messiah even
though we were dead in trespasses. By
grace you are saved!
6 He also raised us up with Him and
seated us with Him in the heavens, in
Christ Jesus,
7 so that in the coming ages He might
display the immeasurable riches of His
grace in His kindness to us in Christ
Jesus.EPHESIANS 2
6
8 For by grace you are saved through
faith, and this is not from yourselves; it
is God's gi --
9 not from works, so that no one can
boast.
10 For we are His crea on--created
in Christ Jesus for good works, which
God prepared ahead of me so that we
should walk in them.
11 So then, remember that at one me
you were Gen les in the ﬂesh--called
"the uncircumcised" by those called "the
circumcised," done by hand in the ﬂesh.
12 At that me you were without the
Messiah, excluded from the ci zenship
of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants
of the promise, with no hope and
without God in the world.
13 But now in Christ Jesus, you who
were far away have been brought near
by the blood of the Messiah.EPHESIANS 2
7
14 For He is our peace, who made both
groups one and tore down the dividing
wall of hos lity. In His ﬂesh,
15 He did away with the law of the
commandments in regula ons, so that
He might create in Himself one new man
from the two, resul ng in peace.
16 He did this so that He might reconcile
both to God in one body through the
cross and put the hos lity to death by it.
17 When Christ came, He proclaimed
the good news of peace to you who
were far away and peace to those who
were near.
18 For through Him we both have access
by one Spirit to the Father.
19 So then you are no longer foreigners
and strangers, but fellow ci zens with
the saints, and members of God's
household,EPHESIANS 2 – 3
20 built on the founda
8
on of the
apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus
Himself as the cornerstone.
21 The whole building is being ﬁ ed
together in Him and is growing into a
holy sanctuary in the Lord,
22 in whom you also are being built
together for God's dwelling in the Spirit.
1 For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner
of Christ Jesus on behalf of you
Gen les--
2 you have heard, haven't you, about
the administra on of God's grace that
He gave to me for you?
3 The mystery was made known to me
by revela on, as I have brieﬂy wri en
above.
4 By reading this you are able to
understand my insight about the
mystery of the Messiah.
5 This was not made known to people in
other genera ons as it is now revealed
3EPHESIANS 3
9
to His holy apostles and prophets by the
Spirit:
6 the Gen les are co-heirs, members
of the same body, and partners of the
promise in Christ Jesus through the
gospel.
7 I was made a servant of this gospel by
the gi of God's grace that was given to
me by the working of His power.
8 This grace was given to me--the least
of all the saints!--to proclaim to the
Gen les the incalculable riches of the
Messiah,
9 and to shed light for all about the
administra on of the mystery hidden for
ages in God who created all things.
10 This is so that God's mul -faceted
wisdom may now be made known
through the church to the rulers and
authori es in the heavens.EPHESIANS 3
10
11 This is according to the purpose of
the ages, which He made in the Messiah,
Jesus our Lord,
12 in whom we have boldness, access,
and conﬁdence through faith in Him.
13 So then I ask you not to be
discouraged over my aﬄic ons on your
behalf, for they are your glory.
14 For this reason I bow my knees
before the Father
15 from whom every family in heaven
and on earth is named.
16 I pray that He may grant you,
according to the riches of His glory, to
be strengthened with power through His
Spirit in the inner man,
17 and that the Messiah may dwell in
your hearts through faith. I pray that
you, being rooted and ﬁrmly established
in love,EPHESIANS 3 – 4
11
18 may be able to comprehend with all
the saints what is the length and width,
height and depth of God's love ,
19 and to know the Messiah's love that
surpasses knowledge, so you may be
ﬁlled with all the fullness of God.
20 Now to Him who is able to do
above and beyond all that we ask or
think--according to the power that works
in you--
21 to Him be glory in the church and in
Christ Jesus to all genera ons, forever
and ever. Amen.
1 I, therefore, the prisoner in the
Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the
calling you have received,
2 with all humility and gentleness, with
pa ence, accep ng one another in love,
3 diligently keeping the unity of the
Spirit with the peace that binds us .
4EPHESIANS 4
12
4 There is one body and one Spirit, just
as you were called to one hope at your
calling;
5 one Lord, one faith, one bap sm,
6 one God and Father of all, who is
above all and through all and in all.
7 Now grace was given to each one
of us according to the measure of the
Messiah's gi .
8 For it says: When He ascended on
high, He took prisoners into cap vity; He
gave gi s to people.
9 But what does "He ascended" mean
except that He descended to the lower
parts of the earth?
10 The One who descended is the same
as the One who ascended far above all
the heavens, that He might ﬁll all things.
11 And He personally gave some to
be apostles, some prophets, some
evangelists, some pastors and teachers,EPHESIANS 4
13
12 for the training of the saints in the
work of ministry, to build up the body of
Christ,
13 un l we all reach unity in the faith
and in the knowledge of God's Son,
growing into a mature man with a
stature measured by Christ's fullness.
14 Then we will no longer be li le
children, tossed by the waves and blown
around by every wind of teaching, by
human cunning with cleverness in the
techniques of deceit.
15 But speaking the truth in love, let us
grow in every way into Him who is the
head--Christ.
16 From Him the whole body, ﬁ ed
and knit together by every suppor ng
ligament, promotes the growth of the
body for building up itself in love by the
proper working of each individual part.
17 Therefore, I say this and tes fy in
the Lord: You should no longer walk asEPHESIANS 4
14
the Gen les walk, in the fu lity of their
thoughts.
18 They are darkened in their
understanding, excluded from the life of
God, because of the ignorance that is in
them and because of the hardness of
their hearts.
19 They became callous and gave
themselves over to promiscuity for the
prac ce of every kind of impurity with a
desire for more and more.
20 But that is not how you learned
about the Messiah,
21 assuming you heard Him and were
taught by Him, because the truth is in
Jesus:
22 you took oﬀ your former way of
life, the old man that is corrupted by
decei ul desires;
23 you are being renewed in the spirit
of your minds;EPHESIANS 4
15
24 you put on the new man, the one
created according to God's likeness in
righteousness and purity of the truth.
25 Since you put away lying, Speak the
truth, each one to his neighbor, because
we are members of one another.
26 Be angry and do not sin. Don't let the
sun go down on your anger,
27 and don't give the Devil an
opportunity.
28 The thief must no longer steal.
Instead, he must do honest work with
his own hands, so that he has something
to share with anyone in need.
29 No ro en talk should come from
your mouth, but only what is good for
the building up of someone in need, in
order to give grace to those who hear.
30 And don't grieve God's Holy
Spirit, who sealed you for the day of
redemp on.EPHESIANS 4 – 5
31 All bi
16
erness, anger and wrath, insult
and slander must be removed from you,
along with all wickedness.
32 And be kind and compassionate to
one another, forgiving one another, just
as God also forgave you in Christ.
1 Therefore, be imitators of God, as
dearly loved children.
2 And walk in love, as the Messiah
also loved us and gave Himself for us, a
sacriﬁcial and fragrant oﬀering to God.
3 But sexual immorality and any
impurity or greed should not even be
heard of among you, as is proper for
saints.
4 And coarse and foolish talking or
crude joking are not suitable, but rather
giving thanks.
5 For know and recognize this: no
sexually immoral or impure or greedy
person, who is an idolater, has an
5EPHESIANS 5
17
inheritance in the kingdom of the
Messiah and of God.
6 Let no one deceive you with empty
arguments, for because of these
things God's wrath is coming on the
disobedient.
7 Therefore, do not become their
partners.
8 For you were once darkness, but now
you are light in the Lord. Walk as children
of light--
9 for the fruit of the light results in all
goodness, righteousness, and truth--
10 discerning what is pleasing to the
Lord.
11 Don't par cipate in the fruitless
works of darkness, but instead, expose
them.
12 For it is shameful even to men on
what is done by them in secret.
13 Everything exposed by the light is
made clear,EPHESIANS 5
18
14 for what makes everything clear is
light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper,
and rise up from the dead, and the
Messiah will shine on you.
15 Pay careful a en on, then, to how
you walk--not as unwise people but as
wise--
16 making the most of the me, because
the days are evil.
17 So don't be foolish, but understand
what the Lord's will is.
18 And don't get drunk with wine, which
leads to reckless ac ons, but be ﬁlled
with the Spirit:
19 speaking to one another in psalms,
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and
making music to the Lord in your heart,
20 giving thanks always for everything
to God the Father in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
21 submi ng to one another in the fear
of Christ.EPHESIANS 5
19
22 Wives, submit to your own husbands
as to the Lord,
23 for the husband is head of the wife
as also Christ is head of the church. He is
the Savior of the body.
24 Now as the church submits to
Christ, so wives should submit to their
husbands in everything.
25 Husbands, love your wives, just as
also Christ loved the church and gave
Himself for her,
26 to make her holy, cleansing her in the
washing of water by the word.
27 He did this to present the church
to Himself in splendor, without spot or
wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and
blameless.
28 In the same way, husbands should
love their wives as their own bodies. He
who loves his wife loves himself.EPHESIANS 5 – 6
20
29 For no one ever hates his own ﬂesh,
but provides and cares for it, just as
Christ does for the church,
30 since we are members of His body.
31 For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be joined to his
wife, and the two will become one ﬂesh.
32 This mystery is profound, but I am
talking about Christ and the church.
33 To sum up, each one of you is to love
his wife as himself, and the wife is to
respect her husband.
1 Children, obey your parents in the
Lord, because this is right.
2 Honor your father and mother
--which is the ﬁrst commandment with a
promise--
3 that it may go well with you and that
you may have a long life in the land.
4 And fathers, don't s r up anger in
your children, but bring them up in the
training and instruc on of the Lord.
6EPHESIANS 6
21
5 Slaves, obey your human masters with
fear and trembling, in the sincerity of
your heart, as to Christ.
6 Don't work only while being watched,
in order to please men, but as slaves of
Christ, do God's will from your heart.
7 Render service with a good a tude,
as to the Lord and not to men,
8 knowing that whatever good each one
does, slave or free, he will receive this
back from the Lord.
9 And masters, treat them the same
way, without threatening them, because
you know that both their and your
Master is in heaven, and there is no
favori sm with Him.
10 Finally, be strengthened by the Lord
and by His vast strength.
11 Put on the full armor of God so that
you can stand against the tac cs of the
Devil.EPHESIANS 6
12 For our ba
22
le is not against ﬂesh and
blood, but against the rulers, against the
authori es, against the world powers of
this darkness, against the spiritual forces
of evil in the heavens.
13 This is why you must take up the
full armor of God, so that you may be
able to resist in the evil day, and having
prepared everything, to take your stand.
14 Stand, therefore, with truth like a
belt around your waist, righteousness
like armor on your chest,
15 and your feet sandaled with
readiness for the gospel of peace.
16 In every situa on take the shield
of faith, and with it you will be able to
ex nguish the ﬂaming arrows of the evil
one.
17 Take the helmet of salva on, and the
sword of the Spirit, which is God's word.
18 With every prayer and request,
pray at all mes in the Spirit, and stayEPHESIANS 6
23
alert in this, with all perseverance and
intercession for all the saints.
19 Pray also for me, that the message
may be given to me when I open my
mouth to make known with boldness
the mystery of the gospel.
20 For this I am an ambassador in
chains. Pray that I might be bold enough
in Him to speak as I should.
21 Tychicus, our dearly loved brother
and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell
you everything so that you also may
know how I am and what I'm doing.
22 I am sending him to you for this very
reason, to let you know how we are and
to encourage your hearts.
23 Peace to the brothers, and love with
faith, from God the Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
24 Grace be with all who have undying
love for our Lord Jesus Christ.Philippians
1
1 Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ
Jesus: To all the saints in Christ
Jesus who are in Philippi, including the
overseers and deacons.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 I give thanks to my God for every
remembrance of you,
4 always praying with joy for all of you
in my every prayer,
5 because of your partnership in the
gospel from the ﬁrst day un l now.
6 I am sure of this, that He who started
a good work in you will carry it on to
comple on un l the day of Christ Jesus.
7 It is right for me to think this way
about all of you, because I have you in
my heart, and you are all partners withPHILIPPIANS 1
2
me in grace, both in my imprisonment
and in the defense and establishment of
the gospel.
8 For God is my witness, how I deeply
miss all of you with the aﬀec on of
Christ Jesus.
9 And I pray this: that your love will
keep on growing in knowledge and every
kind of discernment,
10 so that you can determine what
really ma ers and can be pure and
blameless in the day of Christ,
11 ﬁlled with the fruit of righteousness
that comes through Jesus Christ, to the
glory and praise of God.
12 Now I want you to know, brothers,
that what has happened to me has
actually resulted in the advancement of
the gospel,
13 so that it has become known
throughout the whole imperialPHILIPPIANS 1
3
guard, and to everyone else, that my
imprisonment is for Christ.
14 Most of the brothers in the Lord
have gained conﬁdence from my
imprisonment and dare even more to
speak the message fearlessly.
15 Some, to be sure, preach Christ out
of envy and strife, but others out of good
will.
16 These do so out of love, knowing that
I am appointed for the defense of the
gospel;
17 the others proclaim Christ out of
rivalry, not sincerely, seeking to cause
me trouble in my imprisonment.
18 What does it ma er? Just that in
every way, whether out of false mo ves
or true, Christ is proclaimed. And in this I
rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice
19 because I know this will lead to my
deliverance through your prayers and
help from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.PHILIPPIANS 1
20 My eager expecta
4
on and hope
is that I will not be ashamed about
anything, but that now as always, with all
boldness, Christ will be highly honored
in my body, whether by life or by death.
21 For me, living is Christ and dying is
gain.
22 Now if I live on in the ﬂesh, this
means frui ul work for me; and I don't
know which one I should choose.
23 I am pressured by both. I have
the desire to depart and be with
Christ--which is far be er--
24 but to remain in the ﬂesh is more
necessary for you.
25 Since I am persuaded of this, I know
that I will remain and con nue with all
of you for your advancement and joy in
the faith,
26 so that, because of me, your
conﬁdence may grow in Christ Jesus
when I come to you again.PHILIPPIANS 1 – 2
5
27 Just one thing: live your life in a
manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
Then, whether I come and see you or am
absent, I will hear about you that you
are standing ﬁrm in one spirit, with one
mind, working side by side for the faith
of the gospel,
28 not being frightened in any way by
your opponents. This is evidence of their
destruc on, but of your deliverance--and
this is from God.
29 For it has been given to you on
Christ's behalf not only to believe in Him,
but also to suﬀer for Him,
30 having the same struggle that you
saw I had and now hear about me.
1 If then there is any encouragement
in Christ, if any consola on of love,
if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any
aﬀec on and mercy,
2PHILIPPIANS 2
6
2 fulﬁll my joy by thinking the same
way, having the same love, sharing the
same feelings, focusing on one goal.
3 Do nothing out of rivalry or conceit,
but in humility consider others as more
important than yourselves.
4 Everyone should look out not only
for his own interests, but also for the
interests of others.
5 Make your own a tude that of Christ
Jesus,
6 who, exis ng in the form of God,
did not consider equality with God
as something to be used for His own
advantage.
7 Instead He emp ed Himself by
assuming the form of a slave, taking on
the likeness of men. And when He had
come as a man in His external form,
8 He humbled Himself by becoming
obedient to the point of death--even to
death on a cross.PHILIPPIANS 2
7
9 For this reason God also highly exalted
Him and gave Him the name that is
above every name,
10 so that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow--of those who are in
heaven and on earth and under the
earth--
11 and every tongue should confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
the Father.
12 So then, my dear friends, just as you
have always obeyed, not only in my
presence, but now even more in my
absence, work out your own salva on
with fear and trembling.
13 For it is God who is working in you,
enabling you both to will and to act for
His good purpose.
14 Do everything without grumbling
and arguing,
15 so that you may be blameless and
pure, children of God who are faultlessPHILIPPIANS 2
8
in a crooked and perverted genera on,
among whom you shine like stars in the
world.
16 Hold ﬁrmly the message of life. Then
I can boast in the day of Christ that I
didn't run in vain or labor for nothing.
17 But even if I am poured out as a drink
oﬀering on the sacriﬁce and service of
your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all
of you.
18 In the same way you also should
rejoice and share your joy with me.
19 Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy to you soon so that I also may
be encouraged when I hear news about
you.
20 For I have no one else like-minded
who will genuinely care about your
interests;
21 all seek their own interests, not those
of Jesus Christ.PHILIPPIANS 2
9
22 But you know his proven character,
because he has served with me in the
gospel ministry like a son with a father.
23 Therefore, I hope to send him as
soon as I see how things go with me.
24 And I am convinced in the Lord that I
myself will also come quickly.
25 But I considered it necessary to
send you Epaphroditus--my brother,
co-worker, and fellow soldier, as well
as your messenger and minister to my
need--
26 since he has been longing for all of
you and was distressed because you
heard that he was sick.
27 Indeed, he was so sick that he nearly
died. However, God had mercy on him,
and not only on him but also on me, so
that I would not have one grief on top of
another.
28 For this reason, I am very eager to
send him so that you may rejoice whenPHILIPPIANS 2 – 3
10
you see him again and I may be less
anxious.
29 Therefore, welcome him in the Lord
with all joy and hold men like him in
honor,
30 because he came close to death for
the work of Christ, risking his life to make
up what was lacking in your ministry to
me.
1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the
Lord. To write to you again about this
is no trouble for me and is a protec on
for you.
2 Watch out for "dogs," watch out for
evil workers, watch out for those who
mu late the ﬂesh.
3 For we are the circumcision, the ones
who serve by the Spirit of God, boast in
Christ Jesus, and do not put conﬁdence
in the ﬂesh--
4 although I once had conﬁdence in the
ﬂesh too. If anyone else thinks he has
3PHILIPPIANS 3
11
grounds for conﬁdence in the ﬂesh, I
have more:
5 circumcised the eighth day; of the
na on of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,
a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the
law, a Pharisee;
6 as to zeal, persecu ng the church; as
to the righteousness that is in the law,
blameless.
7 But everything that was a gain to me,
I have considered to be a loss because of
Christ.
8 More than that, I also consider
everything to be a loss in view of the
surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus
my Lord. Because of Him I have suﬀered
the loss of all things and consider them
ﬁlth, so that I may gain Christ
9 and be found in Him, not having
a righteousness of my own from the
law, but one that is through faith inPHILIPPIANS 3
12
Christ--the righteousness from God
based on faith.
10 My goal is to know Him and the
power of His resurrec on and the
fellowship of His suﬀerings, being
conformed to His death,
11 assuming that I will somehow reach
the resurrec on from among the dead.
12 Not that I have already reached the
goal or am already fully mature, but
I make every eﬀort to take hold of it
because I also have been taken hold of
by Christ Jesus.
13 Brothers, I do not consider myself to
have taken hold of it. But one thing I do:
forge ng what is behind and reaching
forward to what is ahead,
14 I pursue as my goal the prize
promised by God's heavenly call in Christ
Jesus.
15 Therefore, all who are mature
should think this way. And if you thinkPHILIPPIANS 3
13
diﬀerently about anything, God will
reveal this to you also.
16 In any case, we should live up to
whatever truth we have a ained.
17 Join in imita ng me, brothers, and
observe those who live according to the
example you have in us.
18 For I have o en told you, and now
say again with tears, that many live as
enemies of the cross of Christ.
19 Their end is destruc on; their god
is their stomach; their glory is in their
shame. They are focused on earthly
things,
20 but our ci zenship is in heaven, from
which we also eagerly wait for a Savior,
the Lord Jesus Christ.
21 He will transform the body of our
humble condi on into the likeness of His
glorious body, by the power that enables
Him to subject everything to Himself.PHILIPPIANS 4

14
1 So then, in this way, my dearly
loved brothers, my joy and crown,
stand ﬁrm in the Lord, dear friends.
2 I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to
agree in the Lord.
3 Yes, I also ask you, true partner, to
help these women who have contended
for the gospel at my side, along with
Clement and the rest of my co-workers
whose names are in the book of life.
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it
again: Rejoice!
5 Let your graciousness be known to
everyone. The Lord is near.
6 Don't worry about anything, but in
everything, through prayer and pe on
with thanksgiving, let your requests be
made known to God.
7 And the peace of God, which
surpasses every thought, will guard your
hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.PHILIPPIANS 4
15
8 Finally brothers, whatever is true,
whatever is honorable, whatever is just,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
whatever is commendable--if there is
any moral excellence and if there is any
praise--dwell on these things.
9 Do what you have learned and
received and heard and seen in me, and
the God of peace will be with you.
10 I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now
at last you have renewed your care for
me. You were, in fact, concerned about
me, but lacked the opportunity to show
it .
11 I don't say this out of need, for I
have learned to be content in whatever
circumstances I am.
12 I know both how to have a li le, and
I know how to have a lot. In any and all
circumstances I have learned the secret
of being content --whether well-fed orPHILIPPIANS 4
16
hungry, whether in abundance or in
need.
13 I am able to do all things through Him
who strengthens me.
14 S ll, you did well by sharing with me
in my hardship.
15 And you, Philippians, know that in
the early days of the gospel, when I le
Macedonia, no church shared with me in
the ma er of giving and receiving except
you alone.
16 For even in Thessalonica you sent
gi s for my need several mes.
17 Not that I seek the gi , but I seek the
fruit that is increasing to your account.
18 But I have received everything in
full, and I have an abundance. I am
fully supplied, having received from
Epaphroditus what you provided--a
fragrant oﬀering, a welcome sacriﬁce,
pleasing to God.PHILIPPIANS 4
17
19 And my God will supply all your
needs according to His riches in glory in
Christ Jesus.
20 Now to our God and Father be glory
forever and ever. Amen.
21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.
Those brothers who are with me greet
you.
22 All the saints greet you, but especially
those from Caesar's household.
23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit.Colossians
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
God's will, and Timothy our brother:
2 To the saints and faithful brothers in
Christ in Colossae. Grace to you and
peace from God our Father.
3 We always thank God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for
you,
4 for we have heard of your faith in
Christ Jesus and of the love you have for
all the saints
5 because of the hope reserved for you
in heaven. You have already heard about
this hope in the message of truth,
6 the gospel that has come to you. It is
bearing fruit and growing all over the
world, just as it has among you since theCOLOSSIANS 1
2
day you heard it and recognized God's
grace in the truth.
7 You learned this from Epaphras, our
much loved fellow slave. He is a faithful
minister of the Messiah on your behalf,
8 and he has told us about your love in
the Spirit.
9 For this reason also, since the day we
heard this, we haven't stopped praying
for you. We are asking that you may be
ﬁlled with the knowledge of His will in all
wisdom and spiritual understanding,
10 so that you may walk worthy of the
Lord, fully pleasing to Him , bearing fruit
in every good work and growing in the
knowledge of God.
11 May you be strengthened with all
power, according to His glorious might,
for all endurance and pa ence, with joy
12 giving thanks to the Father, who
has enabled you to share in the saints'
inheritance in the light.COLOSSIANS 1

13 He has rescued us from the domain
of darkness and transferred us into the
kingdom of the Son He loves,
14 in whom we have redemp on, the
forgiveness of sins.
15 He is the image of the invisible God,
the ﬁrstborn over all crea on;
16 because by Him everything was
created, in heaven and on earth, the
visible and the invisible, whether thrones
or dominions or rulers or authori es--all
things have been created through Him
and for Him.
17 He is before all things, and by Him all
things hold together.
18 He is also the head of the body, the
church; He is the beginning, the ﬁrstborn
from the dead, so that He might come to
have ﬁrst place in everything.
19 For God was pleased to have all His
fullness dwell in Him,COLOSSIANS 1
4
20 and through Him to reconcile
everything to Himself by making peace
through the blood of His cross--whether
things on earth or things in heaven.
21 And you were once alienated and
hos le in mind because of your evil
ac ons.
22 But now He has reconciled you by
His physical body through His death,
to present you holy, faultless, and
blameless before Him--
23 if indeed you remain grounded and
steadfast in the faith, and are not shi ed
away from the hope of the gospel
that you heard. This gospel has been
proclaimed in all crea on under heaven,
and I, Paul, have become a minister of it.
24 Now I rejoice in my suﬀerings for you,
and I am comple ng in my ﬂesh what is
lacking in Christ's aﬄic ons for His body,
that is, the church.COLOSSIANS 1 – 2
5
25 I have become its minister, according
to God's administra on that was given
to me for you, to make God's message
fully known,
26 the mystery hidden for ages and
genera ons but now revealed to His
saints.
27 God wanted to make known to those
among the Gen les the glorious wealth
of this mystery, which is Christ in you,
the hope of glory.
28 We proclaim Him, warning and
teaching everyone with all wisdom, so
that we may present everyone mature in
Christ.
29 I labor for this, striving with His
strength that works powerfully in me.
1 For I want you to know how great
a struggle I have for you, for those in
Laodicea, and for all who have not seen
me in person.
2COLOSSIANS 2
6
2 I want their hearts to be encouraged
and joined together in love, so that
they may have all the riches of assured
understanding, and have the knowledge
of God's mystery--Christ.
3 In Him all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge are hidden.
4 I am saying this so that no one will
deceive you with persuasive arguments.
5 For I may be absent in body, but I am
with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your
good order and the strength of your faith
in Christ.
6 Therefore as you have received Christ
Jesus the Lord, walk in Him,
7 rooted and built up in Him and
established in the faith, just as you
were taught, and overﬂowing with
thankfulness.
8 Be careful that no one takes you
cap ve through philosophy and empty
deceit based on human tradi on, basedCOLOSSIANS 2
7
on the elemental forces of the world,
and not based on Christ.
9 For in Him the en re fullness of God's
nature dwells bodily,
10 and you have been ﬁlled by Him,
who is the head over every ruler and
authority.
11 In Him you were also circumcised
with a circumcision not done with hands,
by pu ng oﬀ the body of ﬂesh, in the
circumcision of the Messiah.
12 Having been buried with Him in
bap sm, you were also raised with Him
through faith in the working of God, who
raised Him from the dead.
13 And when you were dead in
trespasses and in the uncircumcision of
your ﬂesh, He made you alive with Him
and forgave us all our trespasses.
14 He erased the cer ﬁcate of debt,
with its obliga ons, that was against usCOLOSSIANS 2
8
and opposed to us, and has taken it out
of the way by nailing it to the cross.
15 He disarmed the rulers and
authori es and disgraced them publicly;
He triumphed over them by Him.
16 Therefore don't let anyone judge you
in regard to food and drink or in the
ma er of a fes val or a new moon or a
sabbath day.
17 These are a shadow of what was to
come; the substance is the Messiah.
18 Let no one disqualify you, insis ng
on asce c prac ces and the worship of
angels, claiming access to a visionary
realm and inﬂated without cause by his
ﬂeshly mind.
19 He doesn't hold on to the head,
from whom the whole body, nourished
and held together by its ligaments and
tendons, develops with growth from
God.COLOSSIANS 2 – 3
9
20 If you died with Christ to the
elemental forces of this world, why
do you live as if you s ll belonged
to the world? Why do you submit to
regula ons:
21 "Don't handle, don't taste, don't
touch"?
22 All these regula ons refer to what
is destroyed by being used up; they are
human commands and doctrines.
23 Although these have a reputa on of
wisdom by promo ng asce c prac ces,
humility, and severe treatment of the
body, they are not of any value against
ﬂeshly indulgence.
1 So if you have been raised with the
Messiah, seek what is above, where
the Messiah is, seated at the right hand
of God.
2 Set your minds on what is above, not
on what is on the earth.
3COLOSSIANS 3
10
3 For you have died, and your life is
hidden with the Messiah in God.
4 When the Messiah, who is your life, is
revealed, then you also will be revealed
with Him in glory.
5 Therefore, put to death whatever
in you is worldly: sexual immorality,
impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed,
which is idolatry.
6 Because of these, God's wrath comes
on the disobedient,
7 and you once walked in these things
when you were living in them.
8 But now you must also put away all
the following: anger, wrath, malice,
slander, and ﬁlthy language from your
mouth.
9 Do not lie to one another, since
you have put oﬀ the old man with his
prac cesCOLOSSIANS 3
11
10 and have put on the new man, who is
being renewed in knowledge according
to the image of his Creator.
11 Here there is not Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision,
barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but
Christ is all and in all.
12 Therefore, God's chosen ones, holy
and loved, put on hear elt compassion,
kindness, humility, gentleness, and
pa ence,
13 accep ng one another and forgiving
one another if anyone has a complaint
against another. Just as the Lord has
forgiven you, so also you must forgive .
14 Above all, put on love--the perfect
bond of unity.
15 And let the peace of the Messiah, to
which you were also called in one body,
control your hearts. Be thankful.
16 Let the message about the Messiah
dwell richly among you, teaching andCOLOSSIANS 3
12
admonishing one another in all wisdom,
and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual
songs, with gra tude in your hearts to
God.
17 And whatever you do, in word or
in deed, do everything in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the
Father through Him.
18 Wives, be submissive to your
husbands, as is ﬁ ng in the Lord.
19 Husbands, love your wives and don't
become bi er against them.
20 Children, obey your parents in
everything, for this is pleasing in the
Lord.
21 Fathers, do not exasperate your
children, so they won't become
discouraged.
22 Slaves, obey your human masters in
everything; don't work only while being
watched, in order to please men, but
work wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord.COLOSSIANS 3 – 4
13
23 Whatever you do, do it
enthusias cally, as something done for
the Lord and not for men,
24 knowing that you will receive the
reward of an inheritance from the
Lord--you serve the Lord Christ.
25 For the wrongdoer will be paid back
for whatever wrong he has done, and
there is no favori sm.
1 Masters, supply your slaves with
what is right and fair, since you know
that you too have a Master in heaven.
2 Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert
in it with thanksgiving.
3 At the same me, pray also for us
that God may open a door to us for the
message, to speak the mystery of the
Messiah--for which I am in prison--
4 so that I may reveal it as I am required
to speak.
5 Walk in wisdom toward outsiders,
making the most of the me.
4COLOSSIANS 4

6 Your speech should always be
gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you
may know how you should answer each
person.
7 Tychicus, a loved brother, a faithful
servant, and a fellow slave in the Lord,
will tell you all the news about me.
8 I have sent him to you for this very
purpose, so that you may know how we
are, and so that he may encourage your
hearts.
9 He is with Onesimus, a faithful and
loved brother, who is one of you. They
will tell you about everything here.
10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner,
greets you, as does Mark, Barnabas'
cousin (concerning whom you have
received instruc ons: if he comes to you,
welcome him),
11 and so does Jesus who is called
Justus. These alone of the circumcision
are my co-workers for the kingdom ofCOLOSSIANS 4
15
God, and they have been a comfort to
me.
12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave
of Christ Jesus, greets you. He is always
contending for you in his prayers, so that
you can stand mature and fully assured
in everything God wills.
13 For I tes fy about him that he works
hard for you, for those in Laodicea, and
for those in Hierapolis.
14 Luke, the loved physician, and Demas
greet you.
15 Give my gree ngs to the brothers in
Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church
in her house.
16 And when this le er has been read
among you, have it read also in the
church of the Laodiceans; and see that
you also read the le er from Laodicea.
17 And tell Archippus, "Pay a en on to
the ministry you have received in the
Lord, so that you can accomplish it."COLOSSIANS 4
18 This gree
16
ng is in my own hand--Paul.
Remember my imprisonment. Grace be
with you.1 Thessalonians
1
1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: To the
church of the Thessalonians in God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace to you and peace.
2 We always thank God for all of you,
remembering you constantly in our
prayers.
3 We recall, in the presence of our God
and Father, your work of faith, labor of
love, and endurance of hope in our Lord
Jesus Christ,
4 knowing your elec on, brothers loved
by God.
5 For our gospel did not come to you in
word only, but also in power, in the Holy
Spirit, and with much assurance. You
know what kind of men we were among
you for your beneﬁt,1 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
2
6 and you became imitators of us and
of the Lord when, in spite of severe
persecu on, you welcomed the message
with the joy from the Holy Spirit.
7 As a result, you became an example
to all the believers in Macedonia and
Achaia.
8 For the Lord's message rang out from
you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,
but in every place that your faith in God
has gone out, so we don't need to say
anything.
9 For they themselves report about us
what kind of recep on we had from you:
how you turned to God from idols to
serve the living and true God,
10 and to wait for His Son from heaven,
whom He raised from the dead--Jesus,
who rescues us from the coming wrath.
1 For you yourselves know, brothers,
that our visit with you was not
without result.
21 THESSALONIANS 2
2 On the contrary, a
3
er we had
previously suﬀered and been
outrageously treated in Philippi, as
you know, we were emboldened by our
God to speak the gospel of God to you in
spite of great opposi on.
3 For our exhorta on didn't come from
error or impurity or an intent to deceive.
4 Instead, just as we have been
approved by God to be entrusted with
the gospel, so we speak, not to please
men, but rather God, who examines our
hearts.
5 For we never used ﬂa ering speech,
as you know, or had greedy mo ves--God
is our witness--
6 and we didn't seek glory from people,
either from you or from others.
7 Although we could have been a
burden as Christ's apostles, instead we
were gentle among you, as a nursing
mother nurtures her own children.1 THESSALONIANS 2
4
8 We cared so much for you that we
were pleased to share with you not only
the gospel of God but also our own lives,
because you had become dear to us.
9 For you remember our labor and
hardship, brothers. Working night and
day so that we would not burden any of
you, we preached God's gospel to you.
10 You are witnesses, and so is God,
of how devoutly, righteously, and
blamelessly we conducted ourselves
with you believers.
11 As you know, like a father with his
own children,
12 we encouraged, comforted, and
implored each one of you to walk worthy
of God, who calls you into His own
kingdom and glory.
13 Also, this is why we constantly thank
God, because when you received the
message about God that you heard from
us, you welcomed it not as a human1 THESSALONIANS 2
5
message, but as it truly is, the message
of God, which also works eﬀec vely in
you believers.
14 For you, brothers, became imitators
of God's churches in Christ Jesus that are
in Judea, since you have also suﬀered
the same things from people of your
own country, just as they did from the
Jews.
15 They killed both the Lord Jesus
and the prophets, and persecuted us;
they displease God, and are hos le to
everyone,
16 hindering us from speaking to the
Gen les so that they may be saved. As
a result, they are always adding to the
number of their sins, and wrath has
overtaken them completely.
17 But as for us, brothers, a er we were
forced to leave you for a short me (in
person, not in heart), we greatly desired1 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
and made every eﬀort to return and see
you face to face.
18 So we wanted to come to you--even I,
Paul, me and again--but Satan hindered
us.
19 For who is our hope, or joy, or crown
of boas ng in the presence of our Lord
Jesus at His coming? Is it not you?
20 For you are our glory and joy!
1 Therefore, when we could no
longer stand it, we thought it was
be er to be le alone in Athens.
2 And we sent Timothy, our brother
and God's co-worker in the gospel of
Christ, to strengthen and encourage you
concerning your faith,
3 so that no one will be shaken by these
persecu ons. For you yourselves know
that we are appointed to this.
4 In fact, when we were with you, we
told you previously that we were going
31 THESSALONIANS 3
7
to suﬀer persecu on, and as you know,
it happened.
5 For this reason, when I could no longer
stand it, I also sent to ﬁnd out about
your faith, fearing that the tempter had
tempted you and that our labor might
be for nothing.
6 But now Timothy has come to us from
you and brought us good news about
your faith and love, and that you always
have good memories of us, wan ng to
see us, as we also want to see you.
7 Therefore, brothers, in all our distress
and persecu on, we were encouraged
about you through your faith.
8 For now we live, if you stand ﬁrm in
the Lord.
9 How can we thank God for you in
return for all the joy we experience
because of you before our God,1 THESSALONIANS 3 – 4
8
10 as we pray earnestly night and day
to see you face to face and to complete
what is lacking in your faith?
11 Now may our God and Father
Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our
way to you.
12 And may the Lord cause you to
increase and overﬂow with love for one
another and for everyone, just as we
also do for you.
13 May He make your hearts blameless
in holiness before our God and Father at
the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His
saints. Amen.
1 Finally then, brothers, we ask and
encourage you in the Lord Jesus, that
as you have received from us how you
must walk and please God--as you are
doing--do so even more.
2 For you know what commands we
gave you through the Lord Jesus.
41 THESSALONIANS 4
9
3 For this is God's will, your
sanc ﬁca on: that you abstain
from sexual immorality,
4 so that each of you knows how to
possess his own vessel in sanc ﬁca on
and honor,
5 not with lus ul desires, like the
Gen les who don't know God.
6 This means one must not transgress
against and defraud his brother in this
ma er, because the Lord is an avenger of
all these oﬀenses, as we also previously
told and warned you.
7 For God has not called us to impurity,
but to sanc ﬁca on.
8 Therefore, the person who rejects this
does not reject man, but God, who also
gives you His Holy Spirit.
9 About brotherly love: you don't need
me to write you because you yourselves
are taught by God to love one another.1 THESSALONIANS 4
10
10 In fact, you are doing this toward
all the brothers in the en re region of
Macedonia. But we encourage you,
brothers, to do so even more,
11 to seek to lead a quiet life, to mind
your own business, and to work with
your own hands, as we commanded you,
12 so that you may walk properly in
the presence of outsiders and not be
dependent on anyone.
13 We do not want you to be
uninformed, brothers, concerning those
who are asleep, so that you will not
grieve like the rest, who have no hope.
14 Since we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, in the same way God will
bring with Him those who have fallen
asleep through Jesus.
15 For we say this to you by a revela on
from the Lord: We who are s ll alive at
the Lord's coming will certainly have no1 THESSALONIANS 4 – 5
11
advantage over those who have fallen
asleep.
16 For the Lord Himself will descend
from heaven with a shout, with the
archangel's voice, and with the trumpet
of God, and the dead in Christ will rise
ﬁrst.
17 Then we who are s ll alive will be
caught up together with them in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and
so we will always be with the Lord.
18 Therefore encourage one another
with these words.
1 About the mes and the seasons:
brothers, you do not need anything
to be wri en to you.
2 For you yourselves know very well
that the Day of the Lord will come just
like a thief in the night.
3 When they say, "Peace and security,"
then sudden destruc on comes on
51 THESSALONIANS 5
12
them, like labor pains on a pregnant
woman, and they will not escape.
4 But you, brothers, are not in the dark,
so that this day would overtake you like
a thief.
5 For you are all sons of light and sons
of the day. We're not of the night or of
darkness.
6 So then, we must not sleep, like the
rest, but we must stay awake and be
sober.
7 For those who sleep, sleep at night,
and those who get drunk are drunk at
night.
8 But since we are of the day, we must
be sober and put the armor of faith and
love on our chests, and put on a helmet
of the hope of salva on.
9 For God did not appoint us to wrath,
but to obtain salva on through our Lord
Jesus Christ,1 THESSALONIANS 5
13
10 who died for us, so that whether
we are awake or asleep, we will live
together with Him.
11 Therefore encourage one another
and build each other up as you are
already doing.
12 Now we ask you, brothers, to give
recogni on to those who labor among
you and lead you in the Lord and
admonish you,
13 and to esteem them very highly in
love because of their work. Be at peace
among yourselves.
14 And we exhort you, brothers:
warn those who are lazy, comfort the
discouraged, help the weak, be pa ent
with everyone.
15 See to it that no one repays evil for
evil to anyone, but always pursue what
is good for one another and for all.
16 Rejoice always!
17 Pray constantly.1 THESSALONIANS 5
14
18 Give thanks in everything, for this is
God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
19 Don't s ﬂe the Spirit.
20 Don't despise prophecies,
21 but test all things. Hold on to what is
good.
22 Stay away from every form of evil.
23 Now may the God of peace Himself
sanc fy you completely. And may your
spirit, soul, and body be kept sound and
blameless for the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
24 He who calls you is faithful, who also
will do it.
25 Brothers, pray for us also.
26 Greet all the brothers with a holy
kiss.
27 I charge you by the Lord that this
le er be read to all the brothers.
28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you!2 Thessalonians
1
1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: To the
church of the Thessalonians in God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 We must always thank God for you,
brothers, which is ﬁ ng, since your faith
is ﬂourishing, and the love of every one
of you for one another is increasing.
4 Therefore we ourselves boast about
you among God's churches--about
your endurance and faith in all the
persecu ons and aﬄic ons you endure.
5 It is a clear evidence of God's
righteous judgment that you will be
counted worthy of God's kingdom, for
which you also are suﬀering,2 THESSALONIANS 1
2
6 since it is righteous for God to repay
with aﬄic on those who aﬄict you,
7 and to reward with rest you who are
aﬄicted, along with us. This will take
place at the revela on of the Lord Jesus
from heaven with His powerful angels,
8 taking vengeance with ﬂaming ﬁre on
those who don't know God and on those
who don't obey the gospel of our Lord
Jesus.
9 These will pay the penalty of
everlas ng destruc on, away from the
Lord's presence and from His glorious
strength,
10 in that day when He comes to be
gloriﬁed by His saints and to be admired
by all those who have believed, because
our tes mony among you was believed.
11 And in view of this, we always pray
for you that our God will consider you
worthy of His calling, and will, by His2 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
3
power, fulﬁll every desire for goodness
and the work of faith,
12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus
will be gloriﬁed by you, and you by Him,
according to the grace of our God and
the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Now concerning the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ and our being
gathered to Him: we ask you, brothers,
2 not to be easily upset in mind or
troubled, either by a spirit or by a
message or by a le er as if from us,
alleging that the Day of the Lord has
come.
3 Don't let anyone deceive you in any
way. For that day will not come unless
the apostasy comes ﬁrst and the man
of lawlessness is revealed, the son of
destruc on.
4 He opposes and exalts himself above
every so-called god or object of worship,
22 THESSALONIANS 2
4
so that he sits in God's sanctuary,
publicizing that he himself is God.
5 Don't you remember that when I was
s ll with you I told you about this?
6 And you know what currently restrains
him , so that he will be revealed in his
me.
7 For the mystery of lawlessness is
already at work; but the one now
restraining will do so un l he is out of
the way,
8 and then the lawless one will be
revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him
with the breath of His mouth and will
bring him to nothing with the brightness
of His coming.
9 The coming of the lawless one is
based on Satan's working, with all kinds
of false miracles, signs, and wonders,
10 and with every unrighteous
decep on among those who are
perishing. They perish because they did2 THESSALONIANS 2
5
not accept the love of the truth in order
to be saved.
11 For this reason God sends them a
strong delusion so that they will believe
what is false,
12 so that all will be condemned--those
who did not believe the truth but
enjoyed unrighteousness.
13 But we must always thank God for
you, brothers loved by the Lord, because
from the beginning God has chosen you
for salva on through sanc ﬁca on by
the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
14 He called you to this through our
gospel, so that you might obtain the
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15 Therefore, brothers, stand ﬁrm and
hold to the tradi ons you were taught,
either by our message or by our le er.
16 May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself
and God our Father, who has loved us2 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
and given us eternal encouragement and
good hope by grace,
17 encourage your hearts and
strengthen you in every good work and
word.
1 Finally, pray for us, brothers, that
the Lord's message may spread
rapidly and be honored, just as it was
with you,
2 and that we may be delivered from
wicked and evil men, for not all have
faith.
3 But the Lord is faithful; He will
strengthen and guard you from the evil
one.
4 We have conﬁdence in the Lord about
you, that you are doing and will do what
we command.
5 May the Lord direct your hearts to
God's love and Christ's endurance.
6 Now we command you, brothers,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
32 THESSALONIANS 3
7
to keep away from every brother who
walks irresponsibly and not according to
the tradi on received from us.
7 For you yourselves know how
you must imitate us: we were not
irresponsible among you;
8 we did not eat anyone's bread free of
charge; instead, we labored and toiled,
working night and day, so that we would
not be a burden to any of you.
9 It is not that we don't have the right to
support , but we did it to make ourselves
an example to you so that you would
imitate us.
10 In fact, when we were with you, this
is what we commanded you: "If anyone
isn't willing to work, he should not eat."
11 For we hear that there are some
among you who walk irresponsibly, not
working at all, but interfering with the
work of others .2 THESSALONIANS 3
8
12 Now we command and exhort such
people, by the Lord Jesus Christ, that
quietly working, they may eat their own
bread.
13 Brothers, do not grow weary in doing
good.
14 And if anyone does not obey our
instruc on in this le er, take note of that
person; don't associate with him, so that
he may be ashamed.
15 Yet don't treat him as an enemy, but
warn him as a brother.
16 May the Lord of peace Himself give
you peace always in every way. The Lord
be with all of you.
17 This gree ng is in my own hand--Paul.
This is a sign in every le er; this is how I
write.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with all of you.1 Timothy
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus
according to the command of God
our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope:
2 To Timothy, my true child in the faith.
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3 As I urged you when I went to
Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that
you may command certain people not to
teach other doctrine
4 or to pay a en on to myths and
endless genealogies. These promote
empty specula ons rather than God's
plan, which operates by faith.
5 Now the goal of our instruc on is love
from a pure heart, a good conscience,
and a sincere faith.1 TIMOTHY 1
2
6 Some have deviated from these and
turned aside to fruitless discussion.
7 They want to be teachers of the law,
although they don't understand what
they are saying or what they are insis ng
on.
8 Now we know that the law is good,
provided one uses it legi mately.
9 We know that the law is not meant for
a righteous person, but for the lawless
and rebellious, for the ungodly and
sinful, for the unholy and irreverent, for
those who kill their fathers and mothers,
for murderers,
10 for the sexually immoral and
homosexuals, for kidnappers, liars,
perjurers, and for whatever else is
contrary to the sound teaching
11 based on the glorious gospel of the
blessed God that was entrusted to me.
12 I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord,
who has strengthened me, because He1 TIMOTHY 1
3
considered me faithful, appoin ng me
to the ministry--
13 one who was formerly a blasphemer,
a persecutor, and an arrogant man. Since
it was out of ignorance that I had acted
in unbelief, I received mercy,
14 and the grace of our Lord overﬂowed,
along with the faith and love that are in
Christ Jesus.
15 This saying is trustworthy and
deserving of full acceptance: "Christ
Jesus came into the world to save
sinners"--and I am the worst of them.
16 But I received mercy because of this,
so that in me, the worst of them , Christ
Jesus might demonstrate the utmost
pa ence as an example to those who
would believe in Him for eternal life.
17 Now to the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, the only God, be honor and
glory forever and ever. Amen.1 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
4
18 Timothy, my child, I am giving you
this instruc on in keeping with the
prophecies previously made about you,
so that by them you may strongly engage
in ba le,
19 having faith and a good conscience.
Some have rejected these and have
suﬀered the shipwreck of their faith.
20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are
among them, and I have delivered them
to Satan, so that they may be taught not
to blaspheme.
1 First of all, then, I urge that
pe ons, prayers, intercessions, and
thanksgivings be made for everyone,
2 for kings and all those who are in
authority, so that we may lead a tranquil
and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
3 This is good, and it pleases God our
Savior,
4 who wants everyone to be saved and
to come to the knowledge of the truth.
21 TIMOTHY 2
5
5 For there is one God and one mediator
between God and man, a man, Christ
Jesus,
6 who gave Himself--a ransom for all, a
tes mony at the proper me.
7 For this I was appointed a herald, an
apostle (I am telling the truth; I am not
lying), and a teacher of the Gen les in
faith and truth.
8 Therefore I want the men in every
place to pray, li ing up holy hands
without anger or argument.
9 Also, the women are to dress
themselves in modest clothing, with
decency and good sense; not with
elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or
expensive apparel,
10 but with good works, as is proper for
women who aﬃrm that they worship
God.
11 A woman should learn in silence with
full submission.1 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
6
12 I do not allow a woman to teach or to
have authority over a man; instead, she
is to be silent.
13 For Adam was created ﬁrst, then Eve.
14 And Adam was not deceived, but the
woman was deceived and transgressed.
15 But she will be saved through
childbearing, if she con nues in faith,
love, and holiness, with good sense.
1 This saying is trustworthy: "If
anyone aspires to be an overseer, he
desires a noble work."
2 An overseer, therefore, must be above
reproach, the husband of one wife,
self-controlled, sensible, respectable,
hospitable, an able teacher,
3 not addicted to wine, not a bully but
gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy--
4 one who manages his own household
competently, having his children under
control with all dignity.
31 TIMOTHY 3
7
5 (If anyone does not know how to
manage his own household, how will he
take care of God's church?)
6 He must not be a new convert, or he
might become conceited and fall into
the condemna on of the Devil.
7 Furthermore, he must have a good
reputa on among outsiders, so that he
does not fall into disgrace and the Devil's
trap.
8 Deacons, likewise, should be worthy
of respect, not hypocri cal, not drinking
a lot of wine, not greedy for money,
9 holding the mystery of the faith with a
clear conscience.
10 And they must also be tested ﬁrst;
if they prove blameless, then they can
serve as deacons.
11 Wives, too, must be worthy of
respect, not slanderers, self-controlled,
faithful in everything.1 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
8
12 Deacons must be husbands of one
wife, managing their children and their
own households competently.
13 For those who have served well as
deacons acquire a good standing for
themselves, and great boldness in the
faith that is in Christ Jesus.
14 I write these things to you, hoping to
come to you soon.
15 But if I should be delayed, I have
wri en so that you will know how
people ought to act in God's household,
which is the church of the living God, the
pillar and founda on of the truth.
16 And most certainly, the mystery of
godliness is great: He was manifested in
the ﬂesh, jus ﬁed in the Spirit, seen by
angels, preached among the Gen les,
believed on in the world, taken up in
glory.
1 Now the Spirit explicitly says that
in the la er mes some will depart
41 TIMOTHY 4
9
from the faith, paying a en on to
decei ul spirits and the teachings of
demons,
2 through the hypocrisy of liars whose
consciences are seared.
3 They forbid marriage and demand
abs nence from foods that God created
to be received with gra tude by those
who believe and know the truth.
4 For everything created by God is good,
and nothing should be rejected if it is
received with thanksgiving,
5 since it is sanc ﬁed by the word of
God and by prayer.
6 If you point these things out to the
brothers, you will be a good servant of
Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of
the faith and of the good teaching that
you have followed.
7 But have nothing to do with irreverent
and silly myths. Rather, train yourself in
godliness,1 TIMOTHY 4
10
8 for, the training of the body has
a limited beneﬁt, but godliness is
beneﬁcial in every way, since it holds
promise for the present life and also for
the life to come.
9 This saying is trustworthy and
deserves full acceptance.
10 In fact, we labor and strive for this,
because we have put our hope in the
living God, who is the Savior of everyone,
especially of those who believe.
11 Command and teach these things.
12 No one should despise your youth;
instead, you should be an example to
the believers in speech, in conduct, in
love, in faith, in purity.
13 Un l I come, give your a en on
to public reading, exhorta on, and
teaching.
14 Do not neglect the gi that is in you;
it was given to you through prophecy,1 TIMOTHY 4 – 5
11
with the laying on of hands by the
council of elders.
15 Prac ce these things; be commi ed
to them, so that your progress may be
evident to all.
16 Be conscien ous about yourself and
your teaching; persevere in these things,
for by doing this you will save both
yourself and your hearers.
1 Do not rebuke an older man, but
exhort him as a father, younger men
as brothers,
2 older women as mothers, and with all
propriety, the younger women as sisters.
3 Support widows who are genuinely
widows.
4 But if any widow has children or
grandchildren, they should learn to
prac ce their religion toward their own
family ﬁrst and to repay their parents,
for this pleases God.
51 TIMOTHY 5
5 The real widow, le
12
all alone, has put
her hope in God and con nues night and
day in her pe ons and prayers;
6 however, she who is self-indulgent is
dead even while she lives.
7 Command this, so that they won't be
blamed.
8 Now if anyone does not provide for
his own rela ves, and especially for his
household, he has denied the faith and
is worse than an unbeliever.
9 No widow should be placed on the
oﬃcial support list unless she is at least
60 years old, has been the wife of one
husband,
10 and is well known for good works--
that is, if she has brought up children,
shown hospitality, washed the saints'
feet, helped the aﬄicted, and devoted
herself to every good work.1 TIMOTHY 5
13
11 But refuse to enroll younger widows;
for when they are drawn away from
Christ by desire, they want to marry,
12 and will therefore receive
condemna on because they have
renounced their original pledge.
13 At the same me, they also learn to
be idle, going from house to house; they
are not only idle, but are also gossips and
busybodies, saying things they shouldn't
say.
14 Therefore, I want younger women
to marry, have children, manage their
households, and give the adversary no
opportunity to accuse us.
15 For some have already turned away
to follow Satan.
16 If any believing woman has widows,
she should help them, and the church
should not be burdened, so that it can
help those who are genuinely widows.1 TIMOTHY 5
14
17 The elders who are good leaders
should be considered worthy of an
ample honorarium, especially those who
work hard at preaching and teaching.
18 For the Scripture says: You must not
muzzle an ox that is threshing grain, and,
The laborer is worthy of his wages.
19 Don't accept an accusa on against
an elder unless it is supported by two or
three witnesses.
20 Publicly rebuke those who sin, so
that the rest will also be afraid.
21 I solemnly charge you, before God
and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to
observe these things without prejudice,
doing nothing out of favori sm.
22 Don't be too quick to lay hands on
anyone, and don't share in the sins of
others. Keep yourself pure.
23 Don't con nue drinking only water,
but use a li le wine because of your
stomach and your frequent illnesses.1 TIMOTHY 5 – 6
15
24 Some people's sins are evident, going
before them to judgment, but the sins of
others follow them.
25 Likewise, good works are obvious,
and those that are not obvious cannot
remain hidden.
1 All who are under the yoke as slaves
must regard their own masters to be
worthy of all respect, so that God's name
and His teaching will not be blasphemed.
2 And those who have believing masters
should not be disrespec ul to them
because they are brothers, but should
serve them be er, since those who
beneﬁt from their service are believers
and dearly loved. Teach and encourage
these things.
3 If anyone teaches other doctrine and
does not agree with the sound teaching
of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the
teaching that promotes godliness,
61 TIMOTHY 6
16
4 he is conceited, understanding
nothing, but having a sick interest in
disputes and arguments over words.
From these come envy, quarreling,
slanders, evil suspicions,
5 and constant disagreement among
men whose minds are depraved and
deprived of the truth, who imagine that
godliness is a way to material gain.
6 But godliness with contentment is a
great gain.
7 For we brought nothing into the
world, and we can take nothing out.
8 But if we have food and clothing, we
will be content with these.
9 But those who want to be rich fall into
tempta on, a trap, and many foolish and
harmful desires, which plunge people
into ruin and destruc on.
10 For the love of money is a root of
all kinds of evil, and by craving it, some1 TIMOTHY 6
17
have wandered away from the faith and
pierced themselves with many pains.
11 Now you, man of God, run from
these things; but pursue righteousness,
godliness, faith, love, endurance, and
gentleness.
12 Fight the good ﬁght for the faith; take
hold of eternal life, to which you were
called and have made a good confession
before many witnesses.
13 In the presence of God, who gives life
to all, and before Christ Jesus, who gave
a good confession before Pon us Pilate,
I charge you
14 to keep the commandment without
spot or blame un l the appearing of our
Lord Jesus Christ,
15 which God will bring about in His
own me. He is the blessed and only
Sovereign, the King of kings, and the
Lord of lords,1 TIMOTHY 6
18
16 the only One who has immortality,
dwelling in unapproachable light, whom
none of mankind has seen or can see,
to whom be honor and eternal might.
Amen.
17 Instruct those who are rich in the
present age not to be arrogant or to set
their hope on the uncertainty of wealth,
but on God, who richly provides us with
all things to enjoy.
18 Instruct them to do good, to be rich
in good works, to be generous, willing to
share,
19 storing up for themselves a good
founda on for the age to come, so that
they may take hold of life that is real.
20 Timothy, guard what has been
entrusted to you, avoiding irreverent,
empty speech and contradic ons from
the "knowledge" that falsely bears that
name.1 TIMOTHY 6
19
21 By professing it, some people have
deviated from the faith. Grace be with
all of you.2 Timothy
1
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by
God's will, for the promise of life in
Christ Jesus:
2 To Timothy, my dearly loved child.
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3 I thank God, whom I serve with a clear
conscience as my forefathers did, when I
constantly remember you in my prayers
night and day.
4 Remembering your tears, I long to see
you so that I may be ﬁlled with joy,
5 clearly recalling your sincere faith that
ﬁrst lived in your grandmother Lois, then
in your mother Eunice, and that I am
convinced is in you also.2 TIMOTHY 1
2
6 Therefore, I remind you to keep ablaze
the gi of God that is in you through the
laying on of my hands.
7 For God has not given us a spirit of
fearfulness, but one of power, love, and
sound judgment.
8 So don't be ashamed of the tes mony
about our Lord, or of me His prisoner.
Instead, share in suﬀering for the gospel,
relying on the power of God,
9 who has saved us and called us with a
holy calling, not according to our works,
but according to His own purpose and
grace, which was given to us in Christ
Jesus before me began.
10 This has now been made evident
through the appearing of our Savior
Christ Jesus, who has abolished death
and has brought life and immortality to
light through the gospel.
11 For this gospel I was appointed a
herald, apostle, and teacher,2 TIMOTHY 1
3
12 and that is why I suﬀer these things.
But I am not ashamed, because I know
whom I have believed and am persuaded
that He is able to guard what has been
entrusted to me un l that day.
13 Hold on to the pa ern of sound
teaching that you have heard from me,
in the faith and love that are in Christ
Jesus.
14 Guard, through the Holy Spirit who
lives in us, that good thing entrusted to
you.
15 This you know: all those in Asia
have turned away from me, including
Phygelus and Hermogenes.
16 May the Lord grant mercy to the
household of Onesiphorus, because
he o en refreshed me and was not
ashamed of my chains.
17 On the contrary, when he was in
Rome, he diligently searched for me and
found me.2 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
4
18 May the Lord grant that he obtain
mercy from the Lord on that day. And
you know how much he ministered at
Ephesus.
1 You, therefore, my child, be strong
in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 And what you have heard from me in
the presence of many witnesses, commit
to faithful men who will be able to teach
others also.
3 Share in suﬀering as a good soldier of
Christ Jesus.
4 To please the recruiter, no one serving
as a soldier gets entangled in the
concerns of everyday life.
5 Also, if anyone competes as an
athlete, he is not crowned unless he
competes according to the rules.
6 It is the hardworking farmer who
ought to be the ﬁrst to get a share of the
crops.
22 TIMOTHY 2
5
7 Consider what I say, for the Lord will
give you understanding in everything.
8 Keep in mind Jesus Christ, risen
from the dead, descended from David,
according to my gospel.
9 For this I suﬀer, to the point of being
bound like a criminal; but God's message
is not bound.
10 This is why I endure all things for
the elect: so that they also may obtain
salva on, which is in Christ Jesus, with
eternal glory.
11 This saying is trustworthy: For if we
have died with Him, we will also live with
Him;
12 if we endure, we will also reign with
Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny
us;
13 if we are faithless, He remains
faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
14 Remind them of these things,
charging them before God not to ﬁght2 TIMOTHY 2
6
about words; this is in no way proﬁtable
and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
15 Be diligent to present yourself
approved to God, a worker who doesn't
need to be ashamed, correctly teaching
the word of truth.
16 But avoid irreverent, empty speech,
for this will produce an even greater
measure of godlessness.
17 And their word will spread like
gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus
and Philetus.
18 They have deviated from the truth,
saying that the resurrec on has already
taken place, and are overturning the
faith of some.
19 Nevertheless, God's solid founda on
stands ﬁrm, having this inscrip on:
The Lord knows those who are His,
and Everyone who names the name
of the Lord must turn away from
unrighteousness.2 TIMOTHY 2
7
20 Now in a large house there are not
only gold and silver bowls, but also those
of wood and earthenware, some for
special use, some for ordinary.
21 So if anyone puriﬁes himself from
these things, he will be a special
instrument, set apart, useful to the
Master, prepared for every good work.
22 Flee from youthful passions, and
pursue righteousness, faith, love, and
peace, along with those who call on the
Lord from a pure heart.
23 But reject foolish and ignorant
disputes, knowing that they breed
quarrels.
24 The Lord's slave must not quarrel,
but must be gentle to everyone, able to
teach, and pa ent,
25 instruc ng his opponents with
gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them
repentance to know the truth.2 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
8
26 Then they may come to their senses
and escape the Devil's trap, having been
captured by him to do his will.
1 But know this: diﬃcult mes will
come in the last days.
2 For people will be lovers of self, lovers
of money, boas ul, proud, blasphemers,
disobedient to parents, ungrateful,
unholy,
3 unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers,
without self-control, brutal, without love
for what is good,
4 traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God,
5 holding to the form of religion but
denying its power. Avoid these people!
6 For among them are those who worm
their way into households and capture
idle women burdened down with sins,
led along by a variety of passions,
7 always learning and never able to
come to a knowledge of the truth.
32 TIMOTHY 3
9
8 Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted
Moses, so these also resist the truth,
men who are corrupt in mind, worthless
in regard to the faith.
9 But they will not make further
progress, for their lack of understanding
will be clear to all, as theirs was also.
10 But you have followed my teaching,
conduct, purpose, faith, pa ence, love,
and endurance,
11 along with the persecu ons and
suﬀerings that came to me in An och,
Iconium, and Lystra. What persecu ons I
endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from
them all.
12 In fact, all those who want to live
a godly life in Christ Jesus will be
persecuted.
13 Evil people and imposters will
become worse, deceiving and being
deceived.2 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
14 But as for you, con
10
nue in what
you have learned and ﬁrmly believed,
knowing those from whom you learned,
15 and that from childhood you have
known the sacred Scriptures, which are
able to instruct you for salva on through
faith in Christ Jesus.
16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is
proﬁtable for teaching, for rebuking, for
correc ng, for training in righteousness,
17 so that the man of God may be
complete, equipped for every good
work.
1 Before God and Christ Jesus, who
is going to judge the living and the
dead, and by His appearing and His
kingdom, I solemnly charge you:
2 proclaim the message; persist in it
whether convenient or not; rebuke,
correct, and encourage with great
pa ence and teaching.
42 TIMOTHY 4
3 For the
11
me will come when they
will not tolerate sound doctrine, but
according to their own desires, will
accumulate teachers for themselves
because they have an itch to hear
something new.
4 They will turn away from hearing the
truth and will turn aside to myths.
5 But as for you, keep a clear head
about everything, endure hardship, do
the work of an evangelist, fulﬁll your
ministry.
6 For I am already being poured out
as a drink oﬀering, and the me for my
departure is close.
7 I have fought the good ﬁght, I have
ﬁnished the race, I have kept the faith.
8 In the future, there is reserved for me
the crown of righteousness, which the
Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me
on that day, and not only to me, but to
all those who have loved His appearing.2 TIMOTHY 4
12
9 Make every eﬀort to come to me
soon,
10 for Demas has deserted me, because
he loved this present world, and has
gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone
to Gala a, Titus to Dalma a.
11 Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark
with you, for he is useful to me in the
ministry.
12 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
13 When you come, bring the cloak I
le in Troas with Carpus, as well as the
scrolls, especially the parchments.
14 Alexander the coppersmith did great
harm to me. The Lord will repay him
according to his works.
15 Watch out for him yourself, because
he strongly opposed our words.
16 At my ﬁrst defense, no one came to
my assistance, but everyone deserted
me. May it not be counted against them.2 TIMOTHY 4
13
17 But the Lord stood with me
and strengthened me, so that the
proclama on might be fully made
through me, and all the Gen les might
hear. So I was rescued from the lion's
mouth.
18 The Lord will rescue me from every
evil work and will bring me safely into
His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the
glory forever and ever! Amen.
19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the
household of Onesiphorus.
20 Erastus has remained at Corinth;
Trophimus I le sick at Miletus.
21 Make every eﬀort to come before
winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens,
Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace
be with you!Titus

1 Paul, a slave of God, and an apostle
of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's
elect and the knowledge of the truth
that leads to godliness,
2 in the hope of eternal life that God,
who cannot lie, promised before me
began,
3 and has in His own me revealed His
message in the proclama on that I was
entrusted with by the command of God
our Savior:
4 To Titus, my true child in our common
faith. Grace and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
5 The reason I le you in Crete was to
set right what was le undone and, as I
directed you, to appoint elders in every
town:TITUS 1
2
6 someone who is blameless, the
husband of one wife, having faithful
children not accused of wildness or
rebellion.
7 For an overseer, as God's manager,
must be blameless, not arrogant, not
quick tempered, not addicted to wine,
not a bully, not greedy for money,
8 but hospitable, loving what is good,
sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled,
9 holding to the faithful message as
taught, so that he will be able both to
encourage with sound teaching and to
refute those who contradict it.
10 For there are also many rebellious
people, idle talkers and deceivers,
especially those from Judaism.
11 It is necessary to silence them;
they overthrow whole households by
teaching for dishonest gain what they
should not.TITUS 1 – 2
3
12 One of their very own prophets said,
Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy
glu ons.
13 This tes mony is true. So, rebuke
them sharply, that they may be sound in
the faith
14 and may not pay a en on to Jewish
myths and the commandments of men
who reject the truth.
15 To the pure, everything is pure, but
to those who are deﬁled and unbelieving
nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind
and conscience are deﬁled.
16 They profess to know God, but they
deny Him by their works. They are
detestable, disobedient, and disqualiﬁed
for any good work.
1 But you must speak what is
consistent with sound teaching.
2 Older men are to be self-controlled,
worthy of respect, sensible, and sound
in faith, love, and endurance.
2TITUS 2
4
3 In the same way, older women are to
be reverent in behavior, not slanderers,
not addicted to much wine. They are to
teach what is good,
4 so that they may encourage the young
women to love their husbands and
children,
5 to be sensible, pure, good
homemakers, and submissive to
their husbands, so that God's message
will not be slandered.
6 Likewise, encourage the young men
to be sensible
7 about everything. Set an example of
good works yourself, with integrity and
dignity in your teaching.
8 Your message is to be sound beyond
reproach, so that the opponent will be
ashamed, having nothing bad to say
about us.TITUS 2
5
9 Slaves are to be submissive to
their masters in everything, and to be
well-pleasing, not talking back
10 or stealing, but demonstra ng u er
faithfulness, so that they may adorn the
teaching of God our Savior in everything.
11 For the grace of God has appeared,
with salva on for all people,
12 instruc ng us to deny godlessness
and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible,
righteous, and godly way in the present
age,
13 while we wait for the blessed hope
and the appearing of the glory of our
great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
14 He gave Himself for us to redeem us
from all lawlessness and to cleanse for
Himself a special people, eager to do
good works.
15 Say these things, and encourage and
rebuke with all authority. Let no one
disregard you.TITUS 3
3
6
1 Remind them to be submissive to
rulers and authori es, to obey, to be
ready for every good work,
2 to slander no one, to avoid ﬁgh ng,
and to be kind, always showing
gentleness to all people.
3 For we too were once foolish,
disobedient, deceived, cap ves of
various passions and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful, detes ng one
another.
4 But when the goodness and love for
man appeared from God our Savior,
5 He saved us--not by works of
righteousness that we had done, but
according to His mercy, through the
washing of regenera on and renewal by
the Holy Spirit.
6 This Spirit He poured out on us
abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Savior,TITUS 3
7 so that having been jus
7
ﬁed by His
grace, we may become heirs with the
hope of eternal life.
8 This saying is trustworthy. I want
you to insist on these things, so that
those who have believed God might be
careful to devote themselves to good
works. These are good and proﬁtable for
everyone.
9 But avoid foolish debates, genealogies,
quarrels, and disputes about the law, for
they are unproﬁtable and worthless.
10 Reject a divisive person a er a ﬁrst
and second warning,
11 knowing that such a person
is perverted and sins, being self-
condemned.
12 When I send Artemas to you, or
Tychicus, make every eﬀort to come to
me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to
spend the winter there.TITUS 3
8
13 Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and
Apollos on their journey, so that they
will lack nothing.
14 And our people must also learn to
devote themselves to good works for
cases of urgent need, so that they will
not be unfrui ul.
15 All those who are with me greet you.
Greet those who love us in the faith.
Grace be with all of you.Philemon

1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and
Timothy, our brother: To Philemon,
our dear friend and co-worker,
2 to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our
fellow soldier, and to the church that
meets in your house.
3 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I always thank my God when I men on
you in my prayers,
5 because I hear of your love and faith
toward the Lord Jesus and for all the
saints.
6 I pray that your par cipa on in the
faith may become eﬀec ve through
knowing every good thing that is in us
for the glory of Christ.PHILEMON 1
2
7 For I have great joy and
encouragement from your love,
because the hearts of the saints have
been refreshed through you, brother.
8 For this reason, although I have great
boldness in Christ to command you to
do what is right,
9 I appeal, instead, on the basis of love.
I, Paul, as an elderly man and now also
as a prisoner of Christ Jesus,
10 appeal to you for my child, whom I
fathered while in chains--Onesimus.
11 Once he was useless to you, but now
he is useful to both you and me.
12 I am sending him--a part of
myself--back to you.
13 I wanted to keep him with me, so
that in my imprisonment for the gospel
he might serve me in your place.
14 But I didn't want to do anything
without your consent, so that your goodPHILEMON 1
3
deed might not be out of obliga on, but
of your own free will.
15 For perhaps this is why he was
separated from you for a brief me,
so that you might get him back
permanently,
16 no longer as a slave, but more than
a slave--as a dearly loved brother. This
is especially so to me, but even more to
you, both in the ﬂesh and in the Lord.
17 So if you consider me a partner,
accept him as you would me.
18 And if he has wronged you in any
way, or owes you anything, charge that
to my account.
19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand:
I will repay it--not to men on to you that
you owe me even your own self.
20 Yes, brother, may I have joy from you
in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.PHILEMON 1
4
21 Since I am conﬁdent of your
obedience, I am wri ng to you, knowing
that you will do even more than I say.
22 But meanwhile, also prepare a guest
room for me, for I hope that through
your prayers I will be restored to you.
23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in
Christ Jesus, greets you, and so do
24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke,
my co-workers.
25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit.Hebrews
1
1 Long ago God spoke to the fathers
by the prophets at diﬀerent mes
and in diﬀerent ways.
2 In these last days, He has spoken to us
by His Son, whom He has appointed heir
of all things and through whom He made
the universe.
3 He is the radiance of His glory, the
exact expression of His nature, and He
sustains all things by His powerful word.
A er making puriﬁca on for sins, He sat
down at the right hand of the Majesty
on high.
4 So He became higher in rank than the
angels, just as the name He inherited is
superior to theirs.
5 For to which of the angels did He
ever say, You are My Son; today I haveHEBREWS 1
2
become Your Father, or again, I will be
His Father, and He will be My Son ?
6 When He again brings His ﬁrstborn
into the world, He says, And all God's
angels must worship Him.
7 And about the angels He says: He
makes His angels winds, and His servants
a ﬁery ﬂame;
8 but about the Son: Your throne, O
God, is forever and ever, and the scepter
of Your kingdom is a scepter of jus ce.
9 You have loved righteousness and
hated lawlessness; this is why God, Your
God, has anointed You, rather than Your
companions, with the oil of joy.
10 And: In the beginning, Lord, You
established the earth, and the heavens
are the works of Your hands;
11 they will perish, but You remain. They
will all wear out like clothing;
12 You will roll them up like a cloak, and
they will be changed like a robe. But YouHEBREWS 1 – 2
3
are the same, and Your years will never
end.
13 Now to which of the angels has He
ever said: Sit at My right hand un l I
make Your enemies Your footstool ?
14 Are they not all ministering spirits
sent out to serve those who are going to
inherit salva on?
1 We must therefore pay even more
a en on to what we have heard, so
that we will not dri away.
2 For if the message spoken through
angels was legally binding, and every
transgression and disobedience received
a just punishment,
3 how will we escape if we neglect such
a great salva on? It was ﬁrst spoken by
the Lord and was conﬁrmed to us by
those who heard Him.
4 At the same me, God also tes ﬁed
by signs and wonders, various miracles,
2HEBREWS 2
4
and distribu ons of gi s from the Holy
Spirit according to His will.
5 For He has not subjected to angels the
world to come that we are talking about.
6 But one has somewhere tes ﬁed:
What is man, that You remember him, or
the son of man, that You care for him?
7 You made him lower than the angels
for a short me; You crowned him with
glory and honor
8 and subjected everything under his
feet. For in subjec ng everything to
him, He le nothing not subject to him.
As it is, we do not yet see everything
subjected to him.
9 But we do see Jesus--made lower
than the angels for a short me so that
by God's grace He might taste death
for everyone--crowned with glory and
honor because of the suﬀering of death.
10 For it was ﬁ ng, in bringing many
sons to glory, that He, for whom andHEBREWS 2
5
through whom all things exist, should
make the source of their salva on
perfect through suﬀerings.
11 For the One who sanc ﬁes and those
who are sanc ﬁed all have one Father.
That is why He is not ashamed to call
them brothers,
12 saying: I will proclaim Your name to
My brothers; I will sing hymns to You in
the congrega on.
13 Again, I will trust in Him. And again,
Here I am with the children God gave
Me.
14 Now since the children have ﬂesh
and blood in common, He also shared
in these, so that through His death He
might destroy the one holding the power
of death--that is, the Devil--
15 and free those who were held in
slavery all their lives by the fear of death.HEBREWS 2 – 3
6
16 For it is clear that He does not
reach out to help angels, but to help
Abraham's oﬀspring.
17 Therefore He had to be like His
brothers in every way, so that He
could become a merciful and faithful
high priest in service to God, to make
propi a on for the sins of the people.
18 For since He Himself was tested and
has suﬀered, He is able to help those
who are tested.
1 Therefore, holy brothers and
companions in a heavenly calling,
consider Jesus, the apostle and high
priest of our confession;
2 He was faithful to the One who
appointed Him, just as Moses was in all
God's household.
3 For Jesus is considered worthy of
more glory than Moses, just as the
builder has more honor than the house.
3HEBREWS 3
7
4 Now every house is built by someone,
but the One who built everything is God.
5 Moses was faithful as a servant in all
God's household, as a tes mony to what
would be said in the future .
6 But Christ was faithful as a Son over
His household, whose household we are
if we hold on to the courage and the
conﬁdence of our hope.
7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:
Today, if you hear His voice,
8 do not harden your hearts as in the
rebellion, on the day of tes ng in the
desert,
9 where your fathers tested Me, tried
Me , and saw My works
10 for 40 years. Therefore I was
provoked with this genera on and said,
"They always go astray in their hearts,
and they have not known My ways."
11 So I swore in My anger, "They will not
enter My rest."HEBREWS 3
8
12 Watch out, brothers, so that
there won't be in any of you an evil,
unbelieving heart that departs from the
living God.
13 But encourage each other daily, while
it is s ll called today , so that none of
you is hardened by sin's decep on.
14 For we have become companions of
the Messiah if we hold ﬁrmly un l the
end the reality that we had at the start.
15 As it is said: Today, if you hear His
voice, do not harden your hearts as in
the rebellion.
16 For who heard and rebelled? Wasn't
it really all who came out of Egypt under
Moses?
17 And with whom was He "provoked
for 40 years"? Was it not with those who
sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?
18 And to whom did He "swear that
they would not enter His rest," if not
those who disobeyed?HEBREWS 3 – 4
9
19 So we see that they were unable to
enter because of unbelief.
1 Therefore, while the promise
remains of entering His rest, let us
fear so that none of you should miss it.
2 For we also have received the good
news just as they did; but the message
they heard did not beneﬁt them, since
they were not united with those who
heard it in faith
3 (for we who have believed enter the
rest), in keeping with what He has said:
So I swore in My anger, they will not
enter My rest. And yet His works have
been ﬁnished since the founda on of
the world,
4 for somewhere He has spoken about
the seventh day in this way: And on
the seventh day God rested from all His
works.
5 Again, in that passage He says , They
will never enter My rest.
4HEBREWS 4
10
6 Since it remains for some to enter it,
and those who formerly received the
good news did not enter because of
disobedience,
7 again, He speciﬁes a certain day--
today --speaking through David a er
such a long me, as previously stated:
Today if you hear His voice, do not
harden your hearts.
8 For if Joshua had given them rest,
He would not have spoken later about
another day.
9 A Sabbath rest remains, therefore, for
God's people.
10 For the person who has entered His
rest has rested from his own works, just
as God did from His.
11 Let us then make every eﬀort to
enter that rest, so that no one will fall
into the same pa ern of disobedience.
12 For the word of God is living and
eﬀec ve and sharper than any two-HEBREWS 4
11
edged sword, penetra ng as far as to
divide soul, spirit, joints, and marrow; it
is a judge of the ideas and thoughts of
the heart.
13 No creature is hidden from Him, but
all things are naked and exposed to the
eyes of Him to whom we must give an
account.
14 Therefore since we have a great
high priest who has passed through the
heavens--Jesus the Son of God--let us
hold fast to the confession.
15 For we do not have a high priest
who is unable to sympathize with our
weaknesses, but One who has been
tested in every way as we are, yet
without sin.
16 Therefore let us approach the throne
of grace with boldness, so that we may
receive mercy and ﬁnd grace to help us
at the proper me.HEBREWS 5
5
12
1 For every high priest taken from
men is appointed in service to God
for the people, to oﬀer both gi s and
sacriﬁces for sins.
2 He is able to deal gently with those
who are ignorant and are going astray,
since he himself is also subject to
weakness.
3 Because of this, he must make a sin
oﬀering for himself as well as for the
people.
4 No one takes this honor on himself;
instead, a person is called by God, just as
Aaron was.
5 In the same way, the Messiah did not
exalt Himself to become a high priest,
but the One who said to Him, You are My
Son; today I have become Your Father,
6 also said in another passage, You
are a priest forever in the order of
Melchizedek.HEBREWS 5
13
7 During His earthly life, He oﬀered
prayers and appeals, with loud cries
and tears, to the One who was able to
save Him from death, and He was heard
because of His reverence.
8 Though a Son, He learned obedience
through what He suﬀered.
9 A er He was perfected, He became
the source of eternal salva on to all who
obey Him,
10 and He was declared by God a high
priest "in the order of Melchizedek."
11 We have a great deal to say about
this, and it's diﬃcult to explain, since
you have become slow to understand.
12 For though by this me you ought to
be teachers, you need someone to teach
you again the basic principles of God's
revela on. You need milk, not solid food.
13 Now everyone who lives on milk is
inexperienced with the message about
righteousness, because he is an infant.HEBREWS 5 – 6
14
14 But solid food is for the mature--for
those whose senses have been trained
to dis nguish between good and evil.
1 Therefore, leaving the elementary
message about the Messiah, let us
go on to maturity, not laying again the
founda on of repentance from dead
works, faith in God,
2 teaching about ritual washings, laying
on of hands, the resurrec on of the
dead, and eternal judgment.
3 And we will do this if God permits.
4 For it is impossible to renew to
repentance those who were once
enlightened, who tasted the heavenly
gi , became companions with the Holy
Spirit,
5 tasted God's good word and the
powers of the coming age,
6 and who have fallen away, because,
to their own harm, they are recrucifying
6HEBREWS 6
15
the Son of God and holding Him up to
contempt.
7 For ground that has drunk the rain
that has o en fallen on it, and that
produces vegeta on useful to those it is
cul vated for, receives a blessing from
God.
8 But if it produces thorns and thistles,
it is worthless and about to be cursed,
and will be burned at the end.
9 Even though we are speaking this
way, dear friends, in your case we are
conﬁdent of the be er things connected
with salva on.
10 For God is not unjust; He will not
forget your work and the love you
showed for His name when you served
the saints--and you con nue to serve
them.
11 Now we want each of you to
demonstrate the same diligence for the
ﬁnal realiza on of your hope,HEBREWS 6
16
12 so that you won't become lazy,
but imitators of those who inherit
the promises through faith and
perseverance.
13 For when God made a promise to
Abraham, since He had no one greater
to swear by, He swore by Himself:
14 I will most certainly bless you, and I
will greatly mul ply you.
15 And so, a er wai ng pa ently,
Abraham obtained the promise.
16 For men swear by something greater
than themselves, and for them a
conﬁrming oath ends every dispute.
17 Because God wanted to show His
unchangeable purpose even more
clearly to the heirs of the promise, He
guaranteed it with an oath,
18 so that through two unchangeable
things, in which it is impossible for God
to lie, we who have ﬂed for refuge mightHEBREWS 6 – 7
17
have strong encouragement to seize the
hope set before us.
19 We have this hope --like a sure and
ﬁrm anchor of the soul--that enters the
inner sanctuary behind the curtain.
20 Jesus has entered there on our behalf
as a forerunner, because He has become
a "high priest forever in the order of
Melchizedek."
1 For this Melchizedek--King of
Salem, priest of the Most High God,
who met Abraham and blessed him as
he returned from defea ng the kings,
2 and Abraham gave him a tenth of
everything; ﬁrst, his name means "king
of righteousness," then also, "king of
Salem," meaning "king of peace";
3 without father, mother, or genealogy,
having neither beginning of days nor
end of life, but resembling the Son of
God--remains a priest forever.
7HEBREWS 7
18
4 Now consider how great this man was,
to whom even Abraham the patriarch
gave a tenth of the plunder!
5 The sons of Levi who receive the
priestly oﬃce have a commandment
according to the law to collect a
tenth from the people--that is, from
their brothers--though they have also
descended from Abraham.
6 But one without this lineage collected
thes from Abraham and blessed the
one who had the promises.
7 Without a doubt, the inferior is
blessed by the superior.
8 In the one case, men who will die
receive thes; but in the other case,
Scripture tes ﬁes that he lives.
9 And in a sense Levi himself, who
receives thes, has paid thes through
Abraham,
10 for he was s ll within his forefather
when Melchizedek met him.HEBREWS 7
11 If, then, perfec
19
on came through
the Levi cal priesthood (for under it the
people received the law), what further
need was there for another priest to
arise in the order of Melchizedek, and
not to be described as being in the order
of Aaron?
12 For when there is a change of the
priesthood, there must be a change of
law as well.
13 For the One about whom these
things are said belonged to a diﬀerent
tribe, from which no one has served at
the altar.
14 Now it is evident that our Lord came
from Judah, and about that tribe Moses
said nothing concerning priests.
15 And this becomes clearer if another
priest like Melchizedek arises,
16 who doesn't become a priest based
on a legal command concerning physicalHEBREWS 7
20
descent but based on the power of an
indestruc ble life.
17 For it has been tes ﬁed: You
are a priest forever in the order of
Melchizedek.
18 So the previous commandment
is annulled because it was weak and
unproﬁtable
19 (for the law perfected nothing), but
a be er hope is introduced, through
which we draw near to God.
20 None of this happened without an
oath. For others became priests without
an oath,
21 but He with an oath made by the One
who said to Him: The Lord has sworn,
and He will not change His mind, You are
a priest forever.
22 So Jesus has also become the
guarantee of a be er covenant.HEBREWS 7
23 Now many have become Levi
21
cal
priests, since they are prevented by
death from remaining in oﬃce.
24 But because He remains forever, He
holds His priesthood permanently.
25 Therefore He is always able to save
those who come to God through Him,
since He always lives to intercede for
them.
26 For this is the kind of high priest
we need: holy, innocent, undeﬁled,
separated from sinners, and exalted
above the heavens.
27 He doesn't need to oﬀer sacriﬁces
every day, as high priests do--ﬁrst for
their own sins, then for those of the
people. He did this once for all when He
oﬀered Himself.
28 For the law appoints as high priests
men who are weak, but the promise
of the oath, which came a er the law,HEBREWS 8
22
appoints a Son, who has been perfected
forever.
1 Now the main point of what is
being said is this: we have this kind
of high priest, who sat down at the right
hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
heavens,
2 a minister of the sanctuary and the
true tabernacle, which the Lord set up,
and not man.
3 For every high priest is appointed to
oﬀer gi s and sacriﬁces; therefore it was
necessary for this priest also to have
something to oﬀer.
4 Now if He were on earth, He wouldn't
be a priest, since there are those oﬀering
the gi s prescribed by the law.
5 These serve as a copy and shadow
of the heavenly things, as Moses was
warned when he was about to complete
the tabernacle. For He said, Be careful
that you make everything according to
8HEBREWS 8
23
the pa ern that was shown to you on
the mountain.
6 But Jesus has now obtained a superior
ministry, and to that degree He is the
mediator of a be er covenant, which has
been legally enacted on be er promises.
7 For if that ﬁrst covenant had been
faultless, no opportunity would have
been sought for a second one.
8 But ﬁnding fault with His people,
He says: "Look, the days are coming,"
says the Lord, "when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and
with the house of Judah--
9 not like the covenant that I made with
their fathers on the day I took them by
their hand to lead them out of the land
of Egypt. Because they did not con nue
in My covenant, I disregarded them,"
says the Lord.
10 "But this is the covenant that I will
make with the house of Israel a er thoseHEBREWS 8 – 9
24
days," says the Lord: "I will put My laws
into their minds, and I will write them on
their hearts, and I will be their God, and
they will be My people.
11 And each person will not teach his
fellow ci zen, and each his brother,
saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they
will all know Me, from the least to the
greatest of them.
12 For I will be merciful to their
wrongdoing, and I will never again
remember their sins."
13 By saying, a new covenant , He has
declared that the ﬁrst is old. And what is
old and aging is about to disappear.
1 Now the ﬁrst covenant also had
regula ons for ministry and an
earthly sanctuary.
2 For a tabernacle was set up; and in
the ﬁrst room, which is called "the holy
place," were the lampstand, the table,
and the presenta on loaves.
9HEBREWS 9
25
3 Behind the second curtain, the
tabernacle was called "the holy of
holies."
4 It contained the gold altar of incense
and the ark of the covenant, covered
with gold on all sides, in which there was
a gold jar containing the manna, Aaron's
rod that budded, and the tablets of the
covenant.
5 The cherubim of glory were above it
overshadowing the mercy seat. It is not
possible to speak about these things in
detail right now.
6 These things having been set up this
way, the priests enter the ﬁrst room
repeatedly, performing their ministry.
7 But the high priest alone enters the
second room, and that only once a year,
and never without blood, which he
oﬀers for himself and for the sins of the
people commi ed in ignorance.HEBREWS 9
26
8 The Holy Spirit was making it clear
that the way into the holy of holies had
not yet been disclosed while the ﬁrst
tabernacle was s ll standing.
9 This is a symbol for the present
me, during which gi s and sacriﬁces
are oﬀered that cannot perfect the
worshiper's conscience.
10 They are physical regula ons and
only deal with food, drink, and various
washings imposed un l the me of
restora on.
11 Now the Messiah has appeared,
high priest of the good things that have
come. In the greater and more perfect
tabernacle not made with hands (that is,
not of this crea on),
12 He entered the holy of holies once
for all, not by the blood of goats and
calves, but by His own blood, having
obtained eternal redemp on.HEBREWS 9
27
13 For if the blood of goats and bulls
and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling
those who are deﬁled, sanc fy for the
puriﬁca on of the ﬂesh,
14 how much more will the blood of
the Messiah, who through the eternal
Spirit oﬀered Himself without blemish to
God, cleanse our consciences from dead
works to serve the living God?
15 Therefore He is the mediator of a
new covenant, so that those who are
called might receive the promise of the
eternal inheritance, because a death has
taken place for redemp on from the
transgressions commi ed under the ﬁrst
covenant.
16 Where a will exists, the death of the
testator must be established.
17 For a will is valid only when people
die, since it is never in force while the
testator is living.HEBREWS 9
28
18 That is why even the ﬁrst covenant
was inaugurated with blood.
19 For when every commandment had
been proclaimed by Moses to all the
people according to the law, he took
the blood of calves and goats, along
with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop,
and sprinkled the scroll itself and all the
people,
20 saying, This is the blood of the
covenant that God has commanded for
you.
21 In the same way, he sprinkled the
tabernacle and all the vessels of worship
with blood.
22 According to the law almost
everything is puriﬁed with blood, and
without the shedding of blood there is
no forgiveness.
23 Therefore it was necessary for the
copies of the things in the heavens
to be puriﬁed with these sacriﬁces ,HEBREWS 9
29
but the heavenly things themselves to
be puriﬁed with be er sacriﬁces than
these.
24 For the Messiah did not enter a
sanctuary made with hands (only a
model of the true one) but into heaven
itself, that He might now appear in the
presence of God for us.
25 He did not do this to oﬀer Himself
many mes, as the high priest enters
the sanctuary yearly with the blood of
another.
26 Otherwise, He would have had to
suﬀer many mes since the founda on
of the world. But now He has appeared
one me, at the end of the ages, for the
removal of sin by the sacriﬁce of Himself.
27 And just as it is appointed for people
to die once--and a er this, judgment--
28 so also the Messiah, having been
oﬀered once to bear the sins of many,
will appear a second me, not to bearHEBREWS 10
30
sin, but to bring salva on to those who
are wai ng for Him.
1 Since the law has only a shadow
of the good things to come, and
not the actual form of those reali es, it
can never perfect the worshipers by the
same sacriﬁces they con nually oﬀer
year a er year.
2 Otherwise, wouldn't they have
stopped being oﬀered, since the
worshipers, once puriﬁed, would no
longer have any consciousness of sins?
3 But in the sacriﬁces there is a
reminder of sins every year.
4 For it is impossible for the blood of
bulls and goats to take away sins.
5 Therefore, as He was coming into the
world, He said: You did not want sacriﬁce
and oﬀering, but You prepared a body
for Me.
6 You did not delight in whole burnt
oﬀerings and sin oﬀerings.
10HEBREWS 10
31
7 Then I said, "See, I have come--it is
wri en about Me in the volume of the
scroll--to do Your will, O God!"
8 A er He says above, You did not desire
or delight in sacriﬁces and oﬀerings,
whole burnt oﬀerings and sin oﬀerings,
(which are oﬀered according to the law),
9 He then says, See, I have come to
do Your will. He takes away the ﬁrst to
establish the second.
10 By this will, we have been sanc ﬁed
through the oﬀering of the body of Jesus
Christ once and for all.
11 Now every priest stands day a er day
ministering and oﬀering me a er me
the same sacriﬁces, which can never
take away sins.
12 But this man, a er oﬀering one
sacriﬁce for sins forever, sat down at the
right hand of God.
13 He is now wai ng un l His enemies
are made His footstool.HEBREWS 10
32
14 For by one oﬀering He has perfected
forever those who are sanc ﬁed.
15 The Holy Spirit also tes ﬁes to us
about this. For a er He had said:
16 This is the covenant that I will make
with them a er those days, says the
Lord: I will put My laws on their hearts,
and I will write them on their minds,
17 He adds : I will never again remember
their sins and their lawless acts.
18 Now where there is forgiveness of
these, there is no longer an oﬀering for
sin.
19 Therefore, brothers, since we have
boldness to enter the sanctuary through
the blood of Jesus,
20 by the new and living way that He has
inaugurated for us, through the curtain
(that is, His ﬂesh);
21 and since we have a great high priest
over the house of God,HEBREWS 10
33
22 let us draw near with a true heart
in full assurance of faith, our hearts
sprinkled clean from an evil conscience
and our bodies washed in pure water.
23 Let us hold on to the confession of
our hope without wavering, for He who
promised is faithful.
24 And let us be concerned about one
another in order to promote love and
good works,
25 not staying away from our mee ngs,
as some habitually do, but encouraging
each other, and all the more as you see
the day drawing near.
26 For if we deliberately sin a er
receiving the knowledge of the truth,
there no longer remains a sacriﬁce for
sins,
27 but a terrifying expecta on of
judgment, and the fury of a ﬁre about to
consume the adversaries.HEBREWS 10
34
28 If anyone disregards Moses' law,
he dies without mercy, based on the
tes mony of two or three witnesses.
29 How much worse punishment, do
you think one will deserve who has
trampled on the Son of God, regarded
as profane the blood of the covenant by
which he was sanc ﬁed, and insulted
the Spirit of grace?
30 For we know the One who has
said, Vengeance belongs to Me, I will
repay, and again, The Lord will judge His
people.
31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the
hands of the living God!
32 Remember the earlier days when,
a er you had been enlightened, you
endured a hard struggle with suﬀerings.
33 Some mes you were publicly
exposed to taunts and aﬄic ons, and
at other mes you were companions of
those who were treated that way.HEBREWS 10 – 11
35
34 For you sympathized with the
prisoners and accepted with joy the
conﬁsca on of your possessions,
knowing that you yourselves have a
be er and enduring possession.
35 So don't throw away your conﬁdence,
which has a great reward.
36 For you need endurance, so that
a er you have done God's will, you may
receive what was promised.
37 For in yet a very li le while, the
Coming One will come and not delay.
38 But My righteous one will live by
faith; and if he draws back, My soul has
no pleasure in him.
39 But we are not those who draw back
and are destroyed, but those who have
faith and obtain life.
1 Now faith is the reality of what
is hoped for, the proof of what is
not seen.
2 For by it our ancestors were approved.
11HEBREWS 11
36
3 By faith we understand that the
universe was created by the word of
God, so that what is seen has been made
from things that are not visible.
4 By faith Abel oﬀered to God a be er
sacriﬁce than Cain did . By this he was
approved as a righteous man, because
God approved his gi s, and even though
he is dead, he s ll speaks through this.
5 By faith, Enoch was taken away so that
he did not experience death, and he was
not to be found because God took him
away. For prior to his transforma on he
was approved, having pleased God.
6 Now without faith it is impossible to
please God, for the one who draws near
to Him must believe that He exists and
rewards those who seek Him.
7 By faith Noah, a er being warned
about what was not yet seen, in
reverence built an ark to deliver his
family. By this he condemned the worldHEBREWS 11
37
and became an heir of the righteousness
that comes by faith.
8 By faith Abraham, when he was called,
obeyed and went out to a place he was
going to receive as an inheritance; he
went out, not knowing where he was
going.
9 By faith he stayed as a foreigner in the
land of promise, living in tents with Isaac
and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise.
10 For he was looking forward to the city
that has founda ons, whose architect
and builder is God.
11 By faith even Sarah herself, when she
was barren, received power to conceive
oﬀspring, even though she was past the
age, since she considered that the One
who had promised was faithful.
12 And therefore from one man--in
fact, from one as good as dead--came
oﬀspring as numerous as the stars ofHEBREWS 11
38
heaven and as innumerable as the grains
of sand by the seashore.
13 These all died in faith without having
received the promises, but they saw
them from a distance, greeted them,
and confessed that they were foreigners
and temporary residents on the earth.
14 Now those who say such things
make it clear that they are seeking a
homeland.
15 If they had been remembering that
land they came from, they would have
had opportunity to return.
16 But they now aspire to a be er
land--a heavenly one. Therefore God is
not ashamed to be called their God, for
He has prepared a city for them.
17 By faith Abraham, when he was
tested, oﬀered up Isaac; he who had
received the promises was oﬀering up
his unique son,HEBREWS 11
39
18 about whom it had been said, In
Isaac your seed will be called.
19 He considered God to be able even
to raise someone from the dead, from
which he also got him back as an
illustra on.
20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning things to come.
21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying,
blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and,
he worshiped, leaning on the top of his
staﬀ.
22 By faith Joseph, as he was nearing the
end of his life, men oned the exodus of
the sons of Israel and gave instruc ons
concerning his bones.
23 By faith Moses, a er he was born,
was hidden by his parents for three
months, because they saw that the child
was beau ful, and they didn't fear the
king's edict.HEBREWS 11
40
24 By faith Moses, when he had grown
up, refused to be called the son of
Pharaoh's daughter
25 and chose to suﬀer with the people of
God rather than to enjoy the short-lived
pleasure of sin.
26 For he considered reproach for the
sake of the Messiah to be greater wealth
than the treasures of Egypt, since his
a en on was on the reward.
27 By faith he le Egypt behind, not
being afraid of the king's anger, for he
persevered, as one who sees Him who is
invisible.
28 By faith he ins tuted the Passover
and the sprinkling of the blood, so that
the destroyer of the ﬁrstborn might not
touch them.
29 By faith they crossed the Red Sea as
though they were on dry land. When
the Egyp ans a empted to do this, they
were drowned.HEBREWS 11
41
30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down
a er being encircled for seven days.
31 By faith Rahab the pros tute received
the spies in peace and didn't perish with
those who disobeyed.
32 And what more can I say? Time is too
short for me to tell about Gideon, Barak,
Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel
and the prophets,
33 who by faith conquered kingdoms,
administered jus ce, obtained promises,
shut the mouths of lions,
34 quenched the raging of ﬁre, escaped
the edge of the sword, gained strength
a er being weak, became mighty in
ba le, and put foreign armies to ﬂight.
35 Women received their dead raised
to life again. Some men were tortured,
not accep ng release, so that they might
gain a be er resurrec on,HEBREWS 11 – 12
42
36 and others experienced mockings
and scourgings, as well as bonds and
imprisonment.
37 They were stoned, they were sawed
in two, they died by the sword, they
wandered about in sheepskins, in
goatskins, des tute, aﬄicted, and
mistreated.
38 The world was not worthy of them.
They wandered in deserts, mountains,
caves, and holes in the ground.
39 All these were approved through
their faith, but they did not receive what
was promised,
40 since God had provided something
be er for us, so that they would not be
made perfect without us.
1 Therefore since we also have
such a large cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us lay aside every
weight and the sin that so easily
12HEBREWS 12
43
ensnares us, and run with endurance the
race that lies before us,
2 keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source
and perfecter of our faith, who for the
joy that lay before Him endured a cross
and despised the shame, and has sat
down at the right hand of God's throne.
3 For consider Him who endured such
hos lity from sinners against Himself,
so that you won't grow weary and lose
heart.
4 In struggling against sin, you have not
yet resisted to the point of shedding
your blood.
5 And you have forgo en the
exhorta on that addresses you as sons:
My son, do not take the Lord's discipline
lightly, or faint when you are reproved
by Him;
6 for the Lord disciplines the one He
loves, and punishes every son whom He
receives.HEBREWS 12
44
7 Endure it as discipline: God is dealing
with you as sons. For what son is there
whom a father does not discipline?
8 But if you are without discipline-
-which all receive--then you are
illegi mate children and not sons.
9 Furthermore, we had natural fathers
discipline us, and we respected them.
Shouldn't we submit even more to the
Father of spirits and live?
10 For they disciplined us for a short
me based on what seemed good to
them, but He does it for our beneﬁt, so
that we can share His holiness.
11 No discipline seems enjoyable
at the me, but painful. Later on,
however, it yields the fruit of peace and
righteousness to those who have been
trained by it.
12 Therefore strengthen your red
hands and weakened knees,HEBREWS 12
45
13 and make straight paths for your
feet, so that what is lame may not be
dislocated, but healed instead.
14 Pursue peace with everyone, and
holiness--without it no one will see the
Lord.
15 See to it that no one falls short of
the grace of God and that no root of
bi erness springs up, causing trouble
and by it, deﬁling many.
16 And see that there isn't any immoral
or irreverent person like Esau, who sold
his birthright in exchange for one meal.
17 For you know that later, when he
wanted to inherit the blessing, he was
rejected because he didn't ﬁnd any
opportunity for repentance, though he
sought it with tears.
18 For you have not come to what could
be touched, to a blazing ﬁre, to darkness,
gloom, and storm,HEBREWS 12
46
19 to the blast of a trumpet, and the
sound of words. (Those who heard it
begged that not another word be spoken
to them,
20 for they could not bear what was
commanded: And if even an animal
touches the mountain, it must be
stoned!
21 And the appearance was so terrifying
that Moses said, I am terriﬁed and
trembling. )
22 Instead, you have come to Mount
Zion, to the city of the living God (the
heavenly Jerusalem), to myriads of
angels in fes ve gathering,
23 to the assembly of the ﬁrstborn
whose names have been wri en in
heaven, to God who is the judge of all,
to the spirits of righteous people made
perfect,
24 to Jesus (mediator of a new
covenant), and to the sprinkled blood,HEBREWS 12
47
which says be er things than the blood
of Abel.
25 See that you do not reject the One
who speaks; for if they did not escape
when they rejected Him who warned
them on earth, even less will we if we
turn away from Him who warns us from
heaven.
26 His voice shook the earth at that
me, but now He has promised, Yet once
more I will shake not only the earth but
also heaven.
27 Now this expression, "Yet once
more," indicates the removal of what
can be shaken--that is, created things--so
that what is not shaken might remain.
28 Therefore, since we are receiving a
kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us
hold on to grace. By it, we may serve God
acceptably, with reverence and awe;
29 for our God is a consuming ﬁre.HEBREWS 13
1 Let brotherly love con
48
nue.
2 Don't neglect to show
hospitality, for by doing this some have
welcomed angels as guests without
knowing it.
3 Remember the prisoners, as though
you were in prison with them, and the
mistreated, as though you yourselves
were suﬀering bodily.
4 Marriage must be respected by all,
and the marriage bed kept undeﬁled,
because God will judge immoral people
and adulterers.
5 Your life should be free from the love
of money. Be sa sﬁed with what you
have, for He Himself has said, I will never
leave you or forsake you.
6 Therefore, we may boldly say: The
Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
What can man do to me?
7 Remember your leaders who have
spoken God's word to you. As you
13HEBREWS 13
49
carefully observe the outcome of their
lives, imitate their faith.
8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
today, and forever.
9 Don't be led astray by various kinds of
strange teachings; for it is good for the
heart to be established by grace and not
by foods, since those involved in them
have not beneﬁted.
10 We have an altar from which those
who serve the tabernacle do not have a
right to eat.
11 For the bodies of those animals
whose blood is brought into the holy of
holies by the high priest as a sin oﬀering
are burned outside the camp.
12 Therefore Jesus also suﬀered outside
the gate, so that He might sanc fy the
people by His own blood.
13 Let us then go to Him outside the
camp, bearing His disgrace.HEBREWS 13
50
14 For here we do not have an enduring
city; instead, we seek the one to come.
15 Therefore, through Him let us
con nually oﬀer up to God a sacriﬁce of
praise, that is, the fruit of our lips that
confess His name.
16 Don't neglect to do good and to
share, for God is pleased with such
sacriﬁces.
17 Obey your leaders and submit to
them, for they keep watch over your
souls as those who will give an account,
so that they can do this with joy and not
with grief, for that would be unproﬁtable
for you.
18 Pray for us; for we are convinced that
we have a clear conscience, wan ng
to conduct ourselves honorably in
everything.
19 And I especially urge you to pray that
I may be restored to you very soon.HEBREWS 13
51
20 Now may the God of peace, who
brought up from the dead our Lord
Jesus--the great Shepherd of the
sheep--with the blood of the everlas ng
covenant,
21 equip you with all that is good to do
His will, working in us what is pleasing in
His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom
be glory forever and ever. Amen.
22 Brothers, I urge you to receive this
word of exhorta on, for I have wri en
to you in few words.
23 Be aware that our brother Timothy
has been released. If he comes soon
enough, he will be with me when I see
you.
24 Greet all your leaders and all the
saints. Those who are from Italy greet
you.
25 Grace be with all of you.James
1
1 James, a slave of God and of the
Lord Jesus Christ: To the 12 tribes in
the Dispersion. Gree ngs.
2 Consider it a great joy, my brothers,
whenever you experience various trials,
3 knowing that the tes ng of your faith
produces endurance.
4 But endurance must do its complete
work, so that you may be mature and
complete, lacking nothing.
5 Now if any of you lacks wisdom,
he should ask God, who gives to all
generously and without cri cizing, and it
will be given to him.
6 But let him ask in faith without
doub ng. For the doubter is like the
surging sea, driven and tossed by the
wind.JAMES 1
2
7 That person should not expect to
receive anything from the Lord.
8 An indecisive man is unstable in all his
ways.
9 The brother of humble circumstances
should boast in his exalta on;
10 but the one who is rich should boast
in his humilia on, because he will pass
away like a ﬂower of the ﬁeld.
11 For the sun rises with its scorching
heat and dries up the grass; its ﬂower
falls oﬀ, and its beau ful appearance
is destroyed. In the same way, the rich
man will wither away while pursuing his
ac vi es.
12 Blessed is a man who endures trials,
because when he passes the test he will
receive the crown of life that He has
promised to those who love Him.
13 No one undergoing a trial should say,
"I am being tempted by God." For GodJAMES 1
3
is not tempted by evil, and He Himself
doesn't tempt anyone.
14 But each person is tempted when he
is drawn away and en ced by his own
evil desires.
15 Then a er desire has conceived, it
gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully
grown, it gives birth to death.
16 Don't be deceived, my dearly loved
brothers.
17 Every generous act and every perfect
gi is from above, coming down from
the Father of lights; with Him there is no
varia on or shadow cast by turning.
18 By His own choice, He gave us a new
birth by the message of truth so that we
would be the ﬁrs ruits of His creatures.
19 My dearly loved brothers, understand
this: everyone must be quick to hear,
slow to speak, and slow to anger,
20 for man's anger does not accomplish
God's righteousness.JAMES 1
4
21 Therefore, ridding yourselves of
all moral ﬁlth and evil excess, humbly
receive the implanted word, which is
able to save you.
22 But be doers of the word and not
hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
23 Because if anyone is a hearer of the
word and not a doer, he is like a man
looking at his own face in a mirror;
24 for he looks at himself, goes away,
and right away forgets what kind of man
he was.
25 But the one who looks intently
into the perfect law of freedom and
perseveres in it, and is not a forge ul
hearer but a doer who acts--this person
will be blessed in what he does.
26 If anyone thinks he is religious,
without controlling his tongue but
deceiving his heart, his religion is
useless.JAMES 1 – 2
5
27 Pure and undeﬁled religion before
our God and Father is this: to look a er
orphans and widows in their distress and
to keep oneself unstained by the world.
1 My brothers, hold your faith in our
glorious Lord Jesus Christ without
showing favori sm.
2 For suppose a man comes into your
mee ng wearing a gold ring, dressed in
ﬁne clothes, and a poor man dressed in
dirty clothes also comes in.
3 If you look with favor on the man
wearing the ﬁne clothes so that you
say, "Sit here in a good place," and yet
you say to the poor man, "Stand over
there," or, "Sit here on the ﬂoor by my
footstool,"
4 haven't you discriminated among
yourselves and become judges with evil
thoughts?
5 Listen, my dear brothers: Didn't God
choose the poor in this world to be rich
2JAMES 2
6
in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He
has promised to those who love Him?
6 Yet you dishonored that poor man.
Don't the rich oppress you and drag you
into the courts?
7 Don't they blaspheme the noble name
that you bear?
8 If you really carry out the royal law
prescribed in Scripture, You shall love
your neighbor as yourself , you are doing
well.
9 But if you show favori sm, you
commit sin and are convicted by the law
as transgressors.
10 For whoever keeps the en re law, yet
fails in one point, is guilty of breaking it
all.
11 For He who said, Do not commit
adultery , also said, Do not murder. So if
you do not commit adultery, but you do
murder, you are a lawbreaker.JAMES 2
7
12 Speak and act as those who will be
judged by the law of freedom.
13 For judgment is without mercy to the
one who hasn't shown mercy. Mercy
triumphs over judgment.
14 What good is it, my brothers, if
someone says he has faith, but does not
have works? Can his faith save him?
15 If a brother or sister is without
clothes and lacks daily food,
16 and one of you says to them, "Go
in peace, keep warm, and eat well,"
but you don't give them what the body
needs, what good is it?
17 In the same way faith, if it doesn't
have works, is dead by itself.
18 But someone will say, "You have
faith, and I have works." Show me your
faith without works, and I will show you
faith from my works.JAMES 2
8
19 You believe that God is one; you do
well. The demons also believe--and they
shudder.
20 Foolish man! Are you willing to learn
that faith without works is useless?
21 Wasn't Abraham our father jus ﬁed
by works when he oﬀered Isaac his son
on the altar?
22 You see that faith was ac ve together
with his works, and by works, faith was
perfected.
23 So the Scripture was fulﬁlled that
says, Abraham believed God, and it was
credited to him for righteousness , and
he was called God's friend.
24 You see that a man is jus ﬁed by
works and not by faith alone.
25 And in the same way, wasn't Rahab
the pros tute also jus ﬁed by works
when she received the messengers and
sent them out by a diﬀerent route?JAMES 2 – 3
9
26 For just as the body without the spirit
is dead, so also faith without works is
dead.
1 Not many should become teachers,
my brothers, knowing that we will
receive a stricter judgment;
2 for we all stumble in many ways. If
anyone does not stumble in what he
says, he is a mature man who is also able
to control his whole body.
3 Now when we put bits into the
mouths of horses to make them obey us,
we also guide the whole animal.
4 And consider ships: though very large
and driven by ﬁerce winds, they are
guided by a very small rudder wherever
the will of the pilot directs.
5 So too, though the tongue is a small
part of the body , it boasts great things.
Consider how large a forest a small ﬁre
ignites.
3JAMES 3
10
6 And the tongue is a ﬁre. The tongue,
a world of unrighteousness, is placed
among the parts of our bodies ; it
pollutes the whole body, sets the course
of life on ﬁre, and is set on ﬁre by hell.
7 For every creature--animal or bird,
rep le or ﬁsh--is tamed and has been
tamed by man,
8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is
a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
9 With it we bless our Lord and Father,
and with it we curse men who are made
in God's likeness.
10 Out of the same mouth come
blessing and cursing. My brothers, these
things should not be this way.
11 Does a spring pour out sweet and
bi er water from the same opening?
12 Can a ﬁg tree produce olives, my
brothers, or a grapevine produce ﬁgs?
Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh
water.JAMES 3 – 4
11
13 Who is wise and understanding
among you? He should show his
works by good conduct with wisdom's
gentleness.
14 But if you have bi er envy and selﬁsh
ambi on in your heart, don't brag and
lie in deﬁance of the truth.
15 Such wisdom does not come down
from above, but is earthly, sensual,
demonic.
16 For where envy and selﬁsh ambi on
exist, there is disorder and every kind of
evil.
17 But the wisdom from above is
ﬁrst pure, then peace-loving, gentle,
compliant, full of mercy and good fruits,
without favori sm and hypocrisy.
18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown
in peace by those who make peace.
1 What is the source of the wars and
the ﬁghts among you? Don't they
4JAMES 4
12
come from the cravings that are at war
within you?
2 You desire and do not have. You
murder and covet and cannot obtain.
You ﬁght and war. You do not have
because you do not ask.
3 You ask and don't receive because you
ask wrongly, so that you may spend it on
your desires for pleasure.
4 Adulteresses! Do you not know that
friendship with the world is hos lity
toward God? So whoever wants to
be the world's friend becomes God's
enemy.
5 Or do you think it's without reason
the Scripture says that the Spirit He has
caused to live in us yearns jealously?
6 But He gives greater grace. Therefore
He says: God resists the proud, but gives
grace to the humble.
7 Therefore, submit to God. But resist
the Devil, and he will ﬂee from you.JAMES 4
13
8 Draw near to God, and He will draw
near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners,
and purify your hearts, double-minded
people!
9 Be miserable and mourn and weep.
Your laughter must change to mourning
and your joy to sorrow.
10 Humble yourselves before the Lord,
and He will exalt you.
11 Don't cri cize one another, brothers.
He who cri cizes a brother or judges his
brother cri cizes the law and judges the
law. But if you judge the law, you are not
a doer of the law but a judge.
12 There is one lawgiver and judge who
is able to save and to destroy. But who
are you to judge your neighbor?
13 Come now, you who say, "Today or
tomorrow we will travel to such and
such a city and spend a year there and
do business and make a proﬁt."JAMES 4 – 5
14
14 You don't even know what tomorrow
will bring--what your life will be! For you
are a bit of smoke that appears for a
li le while, then vanishes.
15 Instead, you should say, "If the Lord
wills, we will live and do this or that."
16 But as it is, you boast in your
arrogance. All such boas ng is evil.
17 So, for the person who knows to do
good and doesn't do it, it is a sin.
1 Come now, you rich people! Weep
and wail over the miseries that are
coming on you.
2 Your wealth is ruined: your clothes are
moth-eaten;
3 your silver and gold are corroded, and
their corrosion will be a witness against
you and will eat your ﬂesh like ﬁre. You
stored up treasure in the last days!
4 Look! The pay that you withheld from
the workers who reaped your ﬁelds cries
5JAMES 5
15
out, and the outcry of the harvesters has
reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.
5 You have lived luxuriously on the
land and have indulged yourselves. You
have fa ened your hearts for the day of
slaughter.
6 You have condemned--you have
murdered--the righteous man; he does
not resist you.
7 Therefore, brothers, be pa ent un l
the Lord's coming. See how the farmer
waits for the precious fruit of the earth
and is pa ent with it un l it receives the
early and the late rains.
8 You also must be pa ent. Strengthen
your hearts, because the Lord's coming
is near.
9 Brothers, do not complain about one
another, so that you will not be judged.
Look, the judge stands at the door!JAMES 5
16
10 Brothers, take the prophets who
spoke in the Lord's name as an example
of suﬀering and pa ence.
11 See, we count as blessed those
who have endured. You have heard
of Job's endurance and have seen the
outcome from the Lord: the Lord is very
compassionate and merciful.
12 Now above all, my brothers, do not
swear, either by heaven or by earth or
with any other oath. Your "yes" must be
"yes," and your "no" must be "no," so
that you won't fall under judgment.
13 Is anyone among you suﬀering? He
should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He
should sing praises.
14 Is anyone among you sick? He should
call for the elders of the church, and they
should pray over him a er anoin ng him
with olive oil in the name of the Lord.
15 The prayer of faith will save the sick
person, and the Lord will raise him up;JAMES 5
17
and if he has commi ed sins, he will be
forgiven.
16 Therefore, confess your sins to one
another and pray for one another, so
that you may be healed. The intense
prayer of the righteous is very powerful.
17 Elijah was a man with a nature like
ours; yet he prayed earnestly that it
would not rain, and for three years and
six months it did not rain on the land.
18 Then he prayed again, and the sky
gave rain and the land produced its fruit.
19 My brothers, if any among you strays
from the truth, and someone turns him
back,
20 he should know that whoever turns a
sinner from the error of his way will save
his life from death and cover a mul tude
of sins.1 Peter
1
1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ:
To the temporary residents of the
Dispersion in the provinces of Pontus,
Gala a, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
chosen
2 according to the foreknowledge of
God the Father and set apart by the Spirit
for obedience and for the sprinkling with
the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and
peace be mul plied to you.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ. According to His great
mercy, He has given us a new birth into a
living hope through the resurrec on of
Jesus Christ from the dead,
4 and into an inheritance that is
imperishable, uncorrupted, and
unfading, kept in heaven for you,1 PETER 1
2
5 who are being protected by God's
power through faith for a salva on that
is ready to be revealed in the last me.
6 You rejoice in this, though now for a
short me you have had to be distressed
by various trials
7 so that the genuineness of your
faith--more valuable than gold, which
perishes though reﬁned by ﬁre--may
result in praise, glory, and honor at the
revela on of Jesus Christ.
8 You love Him, though you have not
seen Him. And though not seeing Him
now, you believe in Him and rejoice with
inexpressible and glorious joy,
9 because you are receiving the goal of
your faith, the salva on of your souls.
10 Concerning this salva on, the
prophets who prophesied about the
grace that would come to you searched
and carefully inves gated.1 PETER 1
11 They inquired into what
3
me or what
circumstances the Spirit of Christ within
them was indica ng when He tes ﬁed in
advance to the messianic suﬀerings and
the glories that would follow.
12 It was revealed to them that they
were not serving themselves but you
concerning things that have now been
announced to you through those who
preached the gospel to you by the Holy
Spirit sent from heaven. Angels desire to
look into these things.
13 Therefore, get your minds ready for
ac on, being self-disciplined, and set
your hope completely on the grace to be
brought to you at the revela on of Jesus
Christ.
14 As obedient children, do not be
conformed to the desires of your former
ignorance1 PETER 1
4
15 but, as the One who called you is
holy, you also are to be holy in all your
conduct;
16 for it is wri en, Be holy, because I am
holy.
17 And if you address as Father the
One who judges impar ally based on
each one's work, you are to conduct
yourselves in reverence during this me
of temporary residence.
18 For you know that you were
redeemed from your empty way of life
inherited from the fathers, not with
perishable things, like silver or gold,
19 but with the precious blood of Christ,
like that of a lamb without defect or
blemish.
20 He was des ned before the
founda on of the world, but was
revealed at the end of the mes for you
21 who through Him are believers in
God, who raised Him from the dead and1 PETER 1 – 2
5
gave Him glory, so that your faith and
hope are in God.
22 By obedience to the truth, having
puriﬁed yourselves for sincere love of
the brothers, love one another earnestly
from a pure heart,
23 since you have been born again--not
of perishable seed but of imperishable--
through the living and enduring word of
God.
24 For All ﬂesh is like grass, and all its
glory like a ﬂower of the grass. The grass
withers, and the ﬂower drops oﬀ,
25 but the word of the Lord endures
forever. And this is the word that was
preached as the gospel to you.
1 So rid yourselves of all wickedness,
all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all
slander.
2 Like newborn infants, desire the
unadulterated spiritual milk, so that you
may grow by it in your salva on,
21 PETER 2
6
3 since you have tasted that the Lord is
good.
4 Coming to Him, a living stone-
-rejected by men but chosen and
valuable to God--
5 you yourselves, as living stones, are
being built into a spiritual house for
a holy priesthood to oﬀer spiritual
sacriﬁces acceptable to God through
Jesus Christ.
6 For it stands in Scripture: Look! I lay
a stone in Zion, a chosen and valuable
cornerstone, and the one who believes
in Him will never be put to shame!
7 So the honor is for you who believe;
but for the unbelieving, The stone that
the builders rejected--this One has
become the cornerstone, and
8 A stone that causes men to stumble,
and a rock that trips them up. They
stumble by disobeying the message;
they were des ned for this.1 PETER 2
7
9 But you are a chosen race, a royal
priesthood, a holy na on, a people for
His possession, so that you may proclaim
the praises of the One who called you
out of darkness into His marvelous light.
10 Once you were not a people, but
now you are God's people; you had
not received mercy, but now you have
received mercy.
11 Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and
temporary residents to abstain from
ﬂeshly desires that war against you.
12 Conduct yourselves honorably
among the Gen les, so that in a case
where they speak against you as those
who do evil, they may, by observing
your good works, glorify God in a day of
visita on.
13 Submit to every human ins tu on
because of the Lord, whether to the
Emperor as the supreme authority,1 PETER 2
8
14 or to governors as those sent out by
him to punish those who do evil and to
praise those who do good.
15 For it is God's will that you, by doing
good, silence the ignorance of foolish
people.
16 As God's slaves, live as free people,
but don't use your freedom as a way to
conceal evil.
17 Honor everyone. Love the
brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the
Emperor.
18 Household slaves, submit yourselves
to your masters with all respect, not only
to the good and gentle but also to the
cruel.
19 For it brings favor if, because of
conscience toward God, someone
endures grief from suﬀering unjustly.
20 For what credit is there if you endure
when you sin and are beaten? But when1 PETER 2 – 3
9
you do good and suﬀer, if you endure, it
brings favor with God.
21 For you were called to this, because
Christ also suﬀered for you, leaving you
an example, so that you should follow in
His steps.
22 He did not commit sin, and no deceit
was found in His mouth;
23 when reviled, He did not revile
in return; when suﬀering, He did not
threaten, but commi ed Himself to the
One who judges justly.
24 He Himself bore our sins in His body
on the tree, so that, having died to sins,
we might live for righteousness; by His
wounding you have been healed.
25 For you were like sheep going astray,
but you have now returned to the
shepherd and guardian of your souls.
1 Wives, in the same way, submit
yourselves to your own husbands so
that, even if some disobey the Chris an
31 PETER 3
10
message, they may be won over without
a message by the way their wives live,
2 when they observe your pure,
reverent lives.
3 Your beauty should not consist of
outward things like elaborate hairstyles
and the wearing of gold ornaments or
ﬁne clothes;
4 instead, it should consist of the
hidden person of the heart with the
imperishable quality of a gentle and
quiet spirit, which is very valuable in
God's eyes.
5 For in the past, the holy women who
hoped in God also beau ﬁed themselves
in this way, submi ng to their own
husbands,
6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling
him lord. You have become her children
when you do good and aren't frightened
by anything alarming.1 PETER 3
11
7 Husbands, in the same way, live with
your wives with understanding of their
weaker nature yet showing them honor
as co-heirs of the grace of life, so that
your prayers will not be hindered.
8 Now ﬁnally, all of you should be
like-minded and sympathe c, should
love believers, and be compassionate
and humble,
9 not paying back evil for evil or insult
for insult but, on the contrary, giving a
blessing, since you were called for this,
so that you can inherit a blessing.
10 For the one who wants to love
life and to see good days must keep
his tongue from evil and his lips from
speaking deceit,
11 and he must turn away from evil and
do good. He must seek peace and pursue
it,
12 because the eyes of the Lord are on
the righteous and His ears are open to1 PETER 3
12
their request. But the face of the Lord is
against those who do evil.
13 And who will harm you if you are
passionate for what is good?
14 But even if you should suﬀer for
righteousness, you are blessed. Do not
fear what they fear or be disturbed,
15 but set apart the Messiah as Lord in
your hearts, and always be ready to give
a defense to anyone who asks you for a
reason for the hope that is in you.
16 However, do this with gentleness and
respect, keeping your conscience clear,
so that when you are accused, those
who denounce your Chris an life will be
put to shame.
17 For it is be er to suﬀer for doing
good, if that should be God's will, than
for doing evil.
18 For Christ also suﬀered for sins once
for all, the righteous for the unrighteous,
that He might bring you to God, a er1 PETER 3 – 4
13
being put to death in the ﬂeshly realm
but made alive in the spiritual realm.
19 In that state He also went and made
a proclama on to the spirits in prison
20 who in the past were disobedient,
when God pa ently waited in the days of
Noah while an ark was being prepared;
in it, a few--that is, eight people--were
saved through water.
21 Bap sm, which corresponds to this,
now saves you (not the removal of the
ﬁlth of the ﬂesh, but the pledge of a
good conscience toward God) through
the resurrec on of Jesus Christ.
22 Now that He has gone into heaven,
He is at God's right hand, with angels,
authori es, and powers subjected to
Him.
1 Therefore, since Christ suﬀered in
the ﬂesh, arm yourselves also with
the same resolve--because the One who
41 PETER 4
14
suﬀered in the ﬂesh has ﬁnished with
sin--
2 in order to live the remaining me in
the ﬂesh, no longer for human desires,
but for God's will.
3 For there has already been enough
me spent in doing the will of the
pagans: carrying on in unrestrained
behavior, evil desires, drunkenness,
orgies, carousing, and lawless idolatry.
4 In regard to this, they are surprised
that you don't plunge with them into
the same ﬂood of dissipa on--and they
slander you.
5 They will give an account to the One
who stands ready to judge the living and
the dead.
6 For this reason the gospel was also
preached to those who are now dead, so
that, although they might be judged by
men in the ﬂeshly realm, they might live
by God in the spiritual realm.1 PETER 4
15
7 Now the end of all things is near;
therefore, be clear-headed and
disciplined for prayer.
8 Above all, keep your love for one
another at full strength, since love covers
a mul tude of sins.
9 Be hospitable to one another without
complaining.
10 Based on the gi they have received,
everyone should use it to serve others,
as good managers of the varied grace of
God.
11 If anyone speaks, his speech should
be like the oracles of God; if anyone
serves, his service should be from
the strength God provides, so that in
everything God may be gloriﬁed through
Jesus Christ. To Him belong the glory and
the power forever and ever. Amen.
12 Dear friends, when the ﬁery ordeal
arises among you to test you, don't be1 PETER 4
16
surprised by it, as if something unusual
were happening to you.
13 Instead, as you share in the suﬀerings
of the Messiah rejoice, so that you
may also rejoice with great joy at the
revela on of His glory.
14 If you are ridiculed for the name of
Christ, you are blessed, because the
Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
15 None of you, however, should suﬀer
as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as
a meddler.
16 But if anyone suﬀers as a Chris an,
he should not be ashamed, but should
glorify God with that name.
17 For the me has come for judgment
to begin with God's household; and if it
begins with us, what will the outcome
be for those who disobey the gospel of
God?1 PETER 4 – 5
17
18 And if the righteous is saved with
diﬃculty, what will become of the
ungodly and the sinner?
19 So those who suﬀer according to
God's will should, in doing good, entrust
themselves to a faithful Creator.
1 Therefore, as a fellow elder and
witness to the suﬀerings of the
Messiah, and also a par cipant in the
glory about to be revealed, I exhort the
elders among you:
2 shepherd God's ﬂock among you, not
overseeing out of compulsion but freely,
according to God's will ; not for the
money but eagerly;
3 not lording it over those entrusted to
you, but being examples to the ﬂock.
4 And when the chief Shepherd appears,
you will receive the unfading crown of
glory.
5 Likewise, you younger men, be subject
to the elders. And all of you clothe
51 PETER 5
18
yourselves with humility toward one
another, because God resists the proud,
but gives grace to the humble.
6 Humble yourselves therefore under
the mighty hand of God, so that He may
exalt you in due me,
7 cas ng all your care upon Him,
because He cares about you.
8 Be sober! Be on the alert! Your
adversary the Devil is prowling around
like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he
can devour.
9 Resist him, ﬁrm in the faith, knowing
that the same suﬀerings are being
experienced by your brothers in the
world.
10 Now the God of all grace, who
called you to His eternal glory in Christ
Jesus, will personally restore, establish,
strengthen, and support you a er you
have suﬀered a li le.1 PETER 5
19
11 To Him be the dominion forever.
Amen.
12 Through Silvanus, whom I consider
a faithful brother, I have wri en brieﬂy,
encouraging you and tes fying that this
is the true grace of God. Take your stand
in it!
13 She who is in Babylon, also chosen,
sends you gree ngs, as does Mark, my
son.
14 Greet one another with a kiss of love.
Peace to all of you who are in Christ.2 Peter
1
1 Simeon Peter, a slave and an
apostle of Jesus Christ: To those who
have obtained a faith of equal privilege
with ours through the righteousness of
our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 May grace and peace be mul plied to
you through the knowledge of God and
of Jesus our Lord.
3 For His divine power has given
us everything required for life and
godliness, through the knowledge of
Him who called us by His own glory and
goodness.
4 By these He has given us very great
and precious promises, so that through
them you may share in the divine nature,
escaping the corrup on that is in the
world because of evil desires.2 PETER 1
2
5 For this very reason, make every eﬀort
to supplement your faith with goodness,
goodness with knowledge,
6 knowledge with self-control, self-
control with endurance, endurance with
godliness,
7 godliness with brotherly aﬀec on,
and brotherly aﬀec on with love.
8 For if these quali es are yours and are
increasing, they will keep you from being
useless or unfrui ul in the knowledge of
our Lord Jesus Christ.
9 The person who lacks these things
is blind and shortsighted, and has
forgo en the cleansing from his past
sins.
10 Therefore, brothers, make every
eﬀort to conﬁrm your calling and
elec on, because if you do these things
you will never stumble.2 PETER 1
3
11 For in this way, entry into the eternal
kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ will be richly supplied to you.
12 Therefore I will always remind you
about these things, even though you
know them and are established in the
truth you have.
13 I consider it right, as long as I am
in this tent, to wake you up with a
reminder,
14 knowing that I will soon lay aside my
tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has also
shown me.
15 And I will also make every eﬀort that
a er my departure you may be able to
recall these things at any me.
16 For we did not follow cleverly
contrived myths when we made known
to you the power and coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ; instead, we were
eyewitnesses of His majesty.2 PETER 1 – 2
4
17 For when He received honor and
glory from God the Father, a voice came
to Him from the Majes c Glory: This is
My beloved Son. I take delight in Him!
18 And we heard this voice when it
came from heaven while we were with
Him on the holy mountain.
19 So we have the prophe c word
strongly conﬁrmed. You will do well to
pay a en on to it, as to a lamp shining in
a dismal place, un l the day dawns and
the morning star arises in your hearts.
20 First of all, you should know this: no
prophecy of Scripture comes from one's
own interpreta on,
21 because no prophecy ever came by
the will of man; instead, moved by the
Holy Spirit, men spoke from God.
1 But there were also false prophets
among the people, just as there will
be false teachers among you. They will
secretly bring in destruc ve heresies,
22 PETER 2
5
even denying the Master who bought
them, and will bring swi destruc on on
themselves.
2 Many will follow their unrestrained
ways, and because of them the way of
truth will be blasphemed.
3 In their greed they will exploit you with
decep ve words. Their condemna on,
pronounced long ago, is not idle, and
their destruc on does not sleep.
4 For if God didn't spare the angels
who sinned, but threw them down into
Tartarus and delivered them to be kept
in chains of darkness un l judgment;
5 and if He didn't spare the ancient
world, but protected Noah, a preacher of
righteousness, and seven others, when
He brought a ﬂood on the world of the
ungodly;
6 and if He reduced the ci es of Sodom
and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned2 PETER 2
6
them to ruin, making them an example
to those who were going to be ungodly;
7 and if He rescued righteous Lot,
distressed by the unrestrained behavior
of the immoral
8 (for as he lived among them, that
righteous man tormented himself day by
day with the lawless deeds he saw and
heard)--
9 then the Lord knows how to rescue
the godly from trials and to keep the
unrighteous under punishment un l the
day of judgment,
10 especially those who follow the
pollu ng desires of the ﬂesh and despise
authority. Bold, arrogant people! They
do not tremble when they blaspheme
the glorious ones;
11 however, angels, who are greater
in might and power, do not bring a
slanderous charge against them before
the Lord.2 PETER 2
12 But these people, like irra
7
onal
animals--creatures of ins nct born
to be caught and destroyed--speak
blasphemies about things they don't
understand, and in their destruc on
they too will be destroyed,
13 suﬀering harm as the payment for
unrighteousness. They consider it a
pleasure to carouse in the day me. They
are blots and blemishes, deligh ng in
their decep ons as they feast with you,
14 having eyes full of adultery and
always looking for sin, seducing unstable
people, and with hearts trained in greed.
Accursed children!
15 By abandoning the straight path, they
have gone astray and have followed the
path of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who
loved the wages of unrighteousness,
16 but received a rebuke for his
transgression: a speechless donkey2 PETER 2
8
spoke with a human voice and restrained
the prophet's madness.
17 These people are springs without
water, mists driven by a whirlwind. The
gloom of darkness has been reserved for
them.
18 For u ering bombas c, empty
words, they seduce, by ﬂeshly desires
and debauchery, people who have barely
escaped from those who live in error.
19 They promise them freedom, but
they themselves are slaves of corrup on,
since people are enslaved to whatever
defeats them.
20 For if, having escaped the world's
impurity through the knowledge of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are
again entangled in these things and
defeated, the last state is worse for them
than the ﬁrst.
21 For it would have been be er for
them not to have known the way of2 PETER 2 – 3
9
righteousness than, a er knowing it, to
turn back from the holy commandment
delivered to them.
22 It has happened to them according
to the true proverb: A dog returns to its
own vomit, and, "a sow, a er washing
itself, wallows in the mud."
1 Dear friends, this is now the second
le er I've wri en you; in both, I
awaken your pure understanding with a
reminder,
2 so that you can remember the words
previously spoken by the holy prophets,
and the commandment of our Lord and
Savior given through your apostles.
3 First, be aware of this: scoﬀers will
come in the last days to scoﬀ, following
their own lusts,
4 saying, "Where is the promise of His
coming? For ever since the fathers fell
asleep, all things con nue as they have
been since the beginning of crea on."
32 PETER 3
10
5 They willfully ignore this: long ago the
heavens and the earth existed out of
water and through water by the word of
God.
6 Through these the world of that me
perished when it was ﬂooded by water.
7 But by the same word the present
heavens and earth are held in store for
ﬁre, being kept un l the day of judgment
and destruc on of ungodly men.
8 Dear friends, don't let this one thing
escape you: with the Lord one day is like
1,000 years, and 1,000 years like one
day.
9 The Lord does not delay His promise,
as some understand delay, but is pa ent
with you, not wan ng any to perish, but
all to come to repentance.
10 But the Day of the Lord will come like
a thief; on that day the heavens will pass
away with a loud noise, the elements2 PETER 3
11
will burn and be dissolved, and the earth
and the works on it will be disclosed.
11 Since all these things are to be
destroyed in this way, it is clear what sort
of people you should be in holy conduct
and godliness
12 as you wait for and earnestly desire
the coming of the day of God, because
of which the heavens will be on ﬁre and
be dissolved, and the elements will melt
with the heat.
13 But based on His promise, we wait
for new heavens and a new earth, where
righteousness will dwell.
14 Therefore, dear friends, while you
wait for these things, make every eﬀort
to be found in peace without spot or
blemish before Him.
15 Also, regard the pa ence of our Lord
as an opportunity for salva on, just as
our dear brother Paul, according to the
wisdom given to him, has wri en to you.2 PETER 3
12
16 He speaks about these things in all
his le ers, in which there are some
ma ers that are hard to understand.
The untaught and unstable twist them
to their own destruc on, as they also do
with the rest of the Scriptures.
17 Therefore, dear friends, since you
have been forewarned, be on your
guard, so that you are not led away by
the error of the immoral and fall from
your own stability.
18 But grow in the grace and knowledge
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
Him be the glory both now and to the
day of eternity. Amen.1 John
1
1 What was from the beginning, what
we have heard, what we have seen
with our eyes, what we have observed,
and have touched with our hands,
concerning the Word of life--
2 that life was revealed, and we have
seen it and we tes fy and declare to you
the eternal life that was with the Father
and was revealed to us--
3 what we have seen and heard we also
declare to you, so that you may have
fellowship along with us; and indeed our
fellowship is with the Father and with
His Son Jesus Christ.
4 We are wri ng these things so that
our joy may be complete.
5 Now this is the message we have
heard from Him and declare to you:1 JOHN 1 – 2
2
God is light, and there is absolutely no
darkness in Him.
6 If we say, "We have fellowship with
Him," and walk in darkness, we are lying
and are not prac cing the truth.
7 But if we walk in the light as He
Himself is in the light, we have fellowship
with one another, and the blood of Jesus
His Son cleanses us from all sin.
8 If we say, "We have no sin," we are
deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not
in us.
9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and righteous to forgive us our sins and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we say, "We have not sinned," we
make Him a liar, and His word is not in
us.
1 My li le children, I am wri ng you
these things so that you may not
sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an
21 JOHN 2
3
advocate with the Father--Jesus Christ
the righteous One.
2 He Himself is the propi a on for our
sins, and not only for ours, but also for
those of the whole world.
3 This is how we are sure that we have
come to know Him: by keeping His
commands.
4 The one who says, "I have come
to know Him," without keeping His
commands, is a liar, and the truth is not
in him.
5 But whoever keeps His word, truly in
him the love of God is perfected. This is
how we know we are in Him:
6 the one who says he remains in Him
should walk just as He walked.
7 Dear friends, I am not wri ng you a
new command, but an old command
that you have had from the beginning.
The old command is the message you
have heard.1 JOHN 2
8 Yet I am wri
4
ng you a new command,
which is true in Him and in you, because
the darkness is passing away and the
true light is already shining.
9 The one who says he is in the light but
hates his brother is in the darkness un l
now.
10 The one who loves his brother
remains in the light, and there is no
cause for stumbling in him.
11 But the one who hates his brother is
in the darkness, walks in the darkness,
and doesn't know where he's going,
because the darkness has blinded his
eyes.
12 I am wri ng to you, li le children,
because your sins have been forgiven on
account of His name.
13 I am wri ng to you, fathers, because
you have come to know the One who
is from the beginning. I am wri ng to1 JOHN 2
5
you, young men, because you have had
victory over the evil one.
14 I have wri en to you, children,
because you have come to know the
Father. I have wri en to you, fathers,
because you have come to know the
One who is from the beginning. I have
wri en to you, young men, because you
are strong, God's word remains in you,
and you have had victory over the evil
one.
15 Do not love the world or the things
that belong to the world. If anyone loves
the world, love for the Father is not in
him. Because everything that belongs to
the world--
16 the lust of the ﬂesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the pride in one's lifestyle--is
not from the Father, but is from the
world.1 JOHN 2
6
17 And the world with its lust is passing
away, but the one who does God's will
remains forever.
18 Children, it is the last hour. And as
you have heard, "An christ is coming,"
even now many an christs have come.
We know from this that it is the last hour.
19 They went out from us, but they did
not belong to us; for if they had belonged
to us, they would have remained with
us. However, they went out so that it
might be made clear that none of them
belongs to us.
20 But you have an anoin ng from the
Holy One, and you all have knowledge.
21 I have not wri en to you because you
don't know the truth, but because you
do know it, and because no lie comes
from the truth.
22 Who is the liar, if not the one who
denies that Jesus is the Messiah? He is1 JOHN 2
7
the an christ, the one who denies the
Father and the Son.
23 No one who denies the Son can have
the Father; he who confesses the Son
has the Father as well.
24 What you have heard from the
beginning must remain in you. If what
you have heard from the beginning
remains in you, then you will remain in
the Son and in the Father.
25 And this is the promise that He
Himself made to us: eternal life.
26 I have wri en these things to you
about those who are trying to deceive
you.
27 The anoin ng you received from
Him remains in you, and you don't
need anyone to teach you. Instead, His
anoin ng teaches you about all things,
and is true and is not a lie; just as it has
taught you, remain in Him.1 JOHN 2 – 3
28 So now, li
8
le children, remain in Him,
so that when He appears we may have
boldness and not be ashamed before
Him at His coming.
29 If you know that He is righteous, you
know this as well: everyone who does
what is right has been born of Him.
1 Look at how great a love the Father
has given us, that we should be
called God's children. And we are! The
reason the world does not know us is
that it didn't know Him.
2 Dear friends, we are God's children
now, and what we will be has not yet
been revealed. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we
will see Him as He is.
3 And everyone who has this hope in
Him puriﬁes himself just as He is pure.
4 Everyone who commits sin also breaks
the law; sin is the breaking of law.
31 JOHN 3
9
5 You know that He was revealed so
that He might take away sins, and there
is no sin in Him.
6 Everyone who remains in Him does
not sin; everyone who sins has not seen
Him or known Him.
7 Li le children, let no one deceive
you! The one who does what is right is
righteous, just as He is righteous.
8 The one who commits sin is of the
Devil, for the Devil has sinned from the
beginning. The Son of God was revealed
for this purpose: to destroy the Devil's
works.
9 Everyone who has been born of God
does not sin, because His seed remains
in him; he is not able to sin, because he
has been born of God.
10 This is how God's children--and the
Devil's children--are made evident.
Whoever does not do what is right is not1 JOHN 3
10
of God, especially the one who does not
love his brother.
11 For this is the message you have
heard from the beginning: we should
love one another,
12 unlike Cain, who was of the evil one
and murdered his brother. And why did
he murder him? Because his works were
evil, and his brother's were righteous.
13 Do not be surprised, brothers, if the
world hates you.
14 We know that we have passed
from death to life because we love our
brothers. The one who does not love
remains in death.
15 Everyone who hates his brother
is a murderer, and you know that no
murderer has eternal life residing in him.
16 This is how we have come to know
love: He laid down His life for us. We
should also lay down our lives for our
brothers.1 JOHN 3
11
17 If anyone has this world's goods and
sees his brother in need but shuts oﬀ his
compassion from him--how can God's
love reside in him?
18 Li le children, we must not love in
word or speech, but in deed and truth;
19 that is how we will know we are of
the truth, and will convince our hearts in
His presence,
20 because if our hearts condemn us,
God is greater than our hearts and
knows all things.
21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not
condemn us we have conﬁdence before
God,
22 and can receive whatever we
ask from Him because we keep His
commands and do what is pleasing in
His sight.
23 Now this is His command: that we
believe in the name of His Son Jesus1 JOHN 3 – 4
12
Christ, and love one another as He
commanded us.
24 The one who keeps His commands
remains in Him, and He in him. And the
way we know that He remains in us is
from the Spirit He has given us.
1 Dear friends, do not believe
every spirit, but test the spirits to
determine if they are from God, because
many false prophets have gone out into
the world.
2 This is how you know the Spirit of
God: Every spirit who confesses that
Jesus Christ has come in the ﬂesh is from
God.
3 But every spirit who does not confess
Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of
the an christ; you have heard that he is
coming, and he is already in the world
now.
4 You are from God, li le children, and
you have conquered them, because the
41 JOHN 4
13
One who is in you is greater than the
one who is in the world.
5 They are from the world. Therefore
what they say is from the world, and the
world listens to them.
6 We are from God. Anyone who knows
God listens to us; anyone who is not
from God does not listen to us. From this
we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit
of decep on.
7 Dear friends, let us love one another,
because love is from God, and everyone
who loves has been born of God and
knows God.
8 The one who does not love does not
know God, because God is love.
9 God's love was revealed among us
in this way: God sent His One and Only
Son into the world so that we might live
through Him.
10 Love consists in this: not that we
loved God, but that He loved us and sent1 JOHN 4
14
His Son to be the propi a on for our
sins.
11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this
way, we also must love one another.
12 No one has ever seen God. If we love
one another, God remains in us and His
love is perfected in us.
13 This is how we know that we remain
in Him and He in us: He has given to us
from His Spirit.
14 And we have seen and we tes fy that
the Father has sent the Son as Savior of
the world.
15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the
Son of God--God remains in him and he
in God.
16 And we have come to know and to
believe the love that God has for us. God
is love, and the one who remains in love
remains in God, and God remains in him.
17 In this, love is perfected with us so
that we may have conﬁdence in the day1 JOHN 4 – 5
15
of judgment; for we are as He is in this
world.
18 There is no fear in love; instead,
perfect love drives out fear, because fear
involves punishment. So the one who
fears has not reached perfec on in love.
19 We love because He ﬁrst loved us.
20 If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates
his brother, he is a liar. For the person
who does not love his brother whom he
has seen cannot love God whom he has
not seen.
21 And we have this command from
Him: the one who loves God must also
love his brother.
1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is
the Messiah has been born of God,
and everyone who loves the parent also
loves his child.
2 This is how we know that we love
God's children when we love God and
obey His commands.
51 JOHN 5
16
3 For this is what love for God is: to keep
His commands. Now His commands are
not a burden,
4 because whatever has been born of
God conquers the world. This is the
victory that has conquered the world:
our faith.
5 And who is the one who conquers
the world but the one who believes that
Jesus is the Son of God?
6 Jesus Christ--He is the One who came
by water and blood; not by water only,
but by water and by blood. And the
Spirit is the One who tes ﬁes, because
the Spirit is the truth.
7 For there are three that tes fy:
8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood--
and these three are in agreement.
9 If we accept the tes mony of men,
God's tes mony is greater, because it is
God's tes mony that He has given about
His Son.1 JOHN 5
17
10 (The one who believes in the Son of
God has the tes mony in himself. The
one who does not believe God has made
Him a liar, because he has not believed in
the tes mony that God has given about
His Son.)
11 And this is the tes mony: God has
given us eternal life, and this life is in His
Son.
12 The one who has the Son has life.
The one who doesn't have the Son of
God does not have life.
13 I have wri en these things to you
who believe in the name of the Son of
God, so that you may know that you
have eternal life.
14 Now this is the conﬁdence we have
before Him: whenever we ask anything
according to His will, He hears us.
15 And if we know that He hears
whatever we ask, we know that we have
what we have asked Him for.1 JOHN 5
16 If anyone sees his brother commi
18
ng
a sin that does not bring death, he should
ask, and God will give life to him--to
those who commit sin that doesn't bring
death. There is sin that brings death. I
am not saying he should pray about that.
17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there
is sin that does not bring death.
18 We know that everyone who has
been born of God does not sin, but the
One who is born of God keeps him, and
the evil one does not touch him.
19 We know that we are of God, and the
whole world is under the sway of the evil
one.
20 And we know that the Son of God has
come and has given us understanding so
that we may know the true One. We are
in the true One--that is, in His Son Jesus
Christ. He is the true God and eternal
life.1 JOHN 5

1
1 The Elder: To the elect lady and her
children, whom I love in truth--and
not only I, but also all who have come to
know the truth--
2 because of the truth that remains in
us and will be with us forever.
3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with
us from God the Father and from Jesus
Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and
love.
4 I was very glad to ﬁnd some of your
children walking in truth, in keeping with
a command we have received from the
Father.
5 So now I urge you, lady--not as if I were
wri ng you a new command, but one we
have had from the beginning--that we
love one another.2 JOHN 1
2
6 And this is love: that we walk
according to His commands. This is the
command as you have heard it from the
beginning: you must walk in love.
7 Many deceivers have gone out into
the world; they do not confess the
coming of Jesus Christ in the ﬂesh. This
is the deceiver and the an christ.
8 Watch yourselves so that you don't
lose what we have worked for, but you
may receive a full reward.
9 Anyone who does not remain in the
teaching about Christ, but goes beyond
it, does not have God. The one who
remains in that teaching, this one has
both the Father and the Son.
10 If anyone comes to you and does
not bring this teaching, do not receive
him into your home, and don't say,
"Welcome," to him;
11 for the one who says, "Welcome," to
him shares in his evil works.2 JOHN 1
3
12 Though I have many things to write
to you, I don't want to do so with paper
and ink. Instead, I hope to be with you
and talk face to face so that our joy may
be complete.
13 The children of your elect sister send
you gree ngs.3 John
1
1 The Elder: To my dear friend Gaius,
whom I love in truth.
2 Dear friend, I pray that you may
prosper in every way and be in good
health, just as your soul prospers.
3 For I was very glad when some
brothers came and tes ﬁed to your
faithfulness to the truth--how you are
walking in the truth.
4 I have no greater joy than this: to hear
that my children are walking in the truth.
5 Dear friend, you are showing your
faith by whatever you do for the
brothers, and this you are doing for
strangers;
6 they have tes ﬁed to your love before
the church. You will do well to send them3 JOHN 1
2
on their journey in a manner worthy of
God,
7 since they set out for the sake of the
name, accep ng nothing from pagans.
8 Therefore, we ought to support such
men, so that we can be co-workers with
the truth.
9 I wrote something to the church, but
Diotrephes, who loves to have ﬁrst place
among them, does not receive us.
10 This is why, if I come, I will remind
him of the works he is doing, slandering
us with malicious words. And he is not
sa sﬁed with that! He not only refuses
to welcome the brothers himself, but he
even stops those who want to do so and
expels them from the church.
11 Dear friend, do not imitate what is
evil, but what is good. The one who does
good is of God; the one who does evil
has not seen God.3 JOHN 1
12 Demetrius has a good tes
3
mony
from everyone, and from the truth itself.
And we also tes fy for him, and you
know that our tes mony is true.
13 I have many things to write you, but I
don't want to write to you with pen and
ink.
14 I hope to see you soon, and we will
talk face to face. Peace be with you. The

2 May mercy, peace, and love be
mul plied to you.
3 Dear friends, although I was eager to
write you about our common salva on,
I found it necessary to write and exhort
you to contend for the faith that was
delivered to the saints once for all.
4 For certain men, who were designated
for this judgment long ago, have come in
by stealth; they are ungodly, turning the
grace of our God into promiscuity and
denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus
Christ.JUDE 1
2
5 Now I want to remind you, though
you know all these things: the Lord,
having ﬁrst of all saved a people out of
Egypt, later destroyed those who did not
believe;
6 and He has kept, with eternal chains
in darkness for the judgment of the
great day, angels who did not keep their
own posi on but deserted their proper
dwelling.
7 In the same way, Sodom and
Gomorrah and the ci es around them
commi ed sexual immorality and
prac ced perversions, just as they did,
and serve as an example by undergoing
the punishment of eternal ﬁre.
8 Nevertheless, these dreamers likewise
deﬁle their ﬂesh, despise authority, and
blaspheme glorious beings.
9 Yet Michael the archangel, when he
was dispu ng with the Devil in a debate
about Moses' body, did not dare bringJUDE 1
3
an abusive condemna on against him,
but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
10 But these people blaspheme
anything they don't understand,
and what they know by ins nct, like
unreasoning animals--they destroy
themselves with these things.
11 Woe to them! For they have traveled
in the way of Cain, have abandoned
themselves to the error of Balaam for
proﬁt, and have perished in Korah's
rebellion.
12 These are the ones who are like
dangerous reefs at your love feasts.
They feast with you, nurturing only
themselves without fear. They are
waterless clouds carried along by winds;
trees in late autumn--fruitless, twice
dead, pulled out by the roots;
13 wild waves of the sea, foaming up
their shameful deeds; wandering starsJUDE 1
4
for whom is reserved the blackness of
darkness forever!
14 And Enoch, in the seventh genera on
from Adam, prophesied about them:
Look! The Lord comes with thousands of
His holy ones
15 to execute judgment on all, and to
convict them of all their ungodly deeds
that they have done in an ungodly way,
and of all the harsh things ungodly
sinners have said against Him.
16 These people are discontented
grumblers, walking according to their
desires; their mouths u er arrogant
words, ﬂa ering people for their own
advantage.
17 But you, dear friends, remember the
words foretold by the apostles of our
Lord Jesus Christ;
18 they told you, "In the end me there
will be scoﬀers walking according to
their own ungodly desires."JUDE 1
5
19 These people create divisions and
are merely natural, not having the Spirit.
20 But you, dear friends, building
yourselves up in your most holy faith
and praying in the Holy Spirit,
21 keep yourselves in the love of God,
expec ng the mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ for eternal life.
22 Have mercy on some who doubt;
23 save others by snatching them from
the ﬁre; on others have mercy in fear,
ha ng even the garment deﬁled by the
ﬂesh.
24 Now to Him who is able to protect
you from stumbling and to make you
stand in the presence of His glory,
blameless and with great joy,
25 to the only God our Savior, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty,
power, and authority before all me,
now, and forever. Amen.Revela on

and who is coming, the Almighty."
9 I, John, your brother and partner
in the tribula on, kingdom, and
perseverance in Jesus, was on the island
called Patmos because of God's word
and the tes mony about Jesus.REVELATION 1

10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,
and I heard behind me a loud voice like a
trumpet
11 saying, "Write on a scroll what you
see and send it to the seven churches:
Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thya ra,
Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."
12 I turned to see the voice that was
speaking to me. When I turned I saw
seven gold lampstands,
13 and among the lampstands was One
like the Son of Man, dressed in a long
robe, and with a gold sash wrapped
around His chest.
14 His head and hair were white like
wool--white as snow, His eyes like a ﬁery
ﬂame,
15 His feet like ﬁne bronze ﬁred in a
furnace, and His voice like the sound of
cascading waters.
16 In His right hand He had seven stars;
from His mouth came a sharp two-edgedREVELATION 1 – 2

sword; and His face was shining like the
sun at midday.
17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like
a dead man. He laid His right hand on
me, and said, "Don't be afraid! I am the
First and the Last,
18 and the Living One. I was dead, but
look--I am alive forever and ever, and I
hold the keys of death and Hades.
19 Therefore write what you have seen,
what is, and what will take place a er
this.
20 The secret of the seven stars you
saw in My right hand, and of the seven
gold lampstands, is this: the seven stars
are the angels of the seven churches,
and the seven lampstands are the seven
churches.
1 "To the angel of the church in
Ephesus write: "The One who holds
the seven stars in His right hand and who

walks among the seven gold lampstands
says:
2 I know your works, your labor, and
your endurance, and that you cannot
tolerate evil. You have tested those who
call themselves apostles and are not,
and you have found them to be liars.
3 You also possess endurance and have
tolerated many things because of My
name, and have not grown weary.
4 But I have this against you: you have
abandoned the love you had at ﬁrst.
5 Remember then how far you have
fallen; repent, and do the works you did
at ﬁrst. Otherwise, I will come to you
and remove your lampstand from its
place--unless you repent.
6 Yet you do have this: you hate the
prac ces of the Nicolaitans, which I also
hate.

but are a synagogue of Satan.
10 Don't be afraid of what you are about
to suﬀer. Look, the Devil is about to
throw some of you into prison to test
you, and you will have tribula on for 10
days. Be faithful un l death, and I will
give you the crown of life.

throne is! And you are holding on to My
name and did not deny your faith in Me,
even in the days of An pas, My faithful
witness, who was killed among you,
where Satan lives.
14 But I have a few things against you.
You have some there who hold to the
teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to
place a stumbling block in front of the
sons of Israel: to eat meat sacriﬁced to
idols and to commit sexual immorality.

those who hold to the teaching of the

tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls
herself a prophetess, and teaches and

immorality and to eat meat sacriﬁced to

me to repent, but she
does not want to repent of her sexual
immorality.

of her prac ces.
23 I will kill her children with the plague.
Then all the churches will know that I
am the One who examines minds and
hearts, and I will give to each of you

24 I say to the rest of you in Thya ra,
who do not hold this teaching, who
haven't known the deep things of

Father on His throne.
22 "Anyone who has an ear should listen
to what the Spirit says to the churches."
1 A er this I looked, and there in
heaven was an open door. The ﬁrst
voice that I had heard speaking to me
like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I
will show you what must take place a er
this."
2 Immediately I was in the Spirit, and
there in heaven a throne was set. One
was seated on the throne,
4REVELATION 4
15
3 and the One seated looked like jasper
and carnelian stone. A rainbow that
looked like an emerald surrounded the
throne.
4 Around that throne were 24 thrones,
and on the thrones sat 24 elders dressed
in white clothes, with gold crowns on
their heads.
5 From the throne came ﬂashes of
lightning, rumblings, and thunder.
Burning before the throne were seven
ﬁery torches, which are the seven spirits
of God.
6 Also before the throne was something
like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In
the middle and around the throne were
four living creatures covered with eyes
in front and in back.
7 The ﬁrst living creature was like a lion;
the second living creature was like a calf;
the third living creature had a face like aREVELATION 4
16
man; and the fourth living creature was
like a ﬂying eagle.
8 Each of the four living creatures had
six wings; they were covered with eyes
around and inside. Day and night they
never stop, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord
God, the Almighty, who was, who is, and
who is coming.
9 Whenever the living creatures give
glory, honor, and thanks to the One
seated on the throne, the One who lives
forever and ever,
10 the 24 elders fall down before the
One seated on the throne, worship the
One who lives forever and ever, cast
their crowns before the throne, and say:
11 Our Lord and God, You are worthy
to receive glory and honor and power,
because You have created all things, and
because of Your will they exist and were
created.REVELATION 5

17
1 Then I saw in the right hand of the
One seated on the throne a scroll
with wri ng on the inside and on the
back, sealed with seven seals.
2 I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming
in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open
the scroll and break its seals?"
3 But no one in heaven or on earth or
under the earth was able to open the
scroll or even to look in it.
4 And I cried and cried because no one
was found worthy to open the scroll or
even to look in it.
5 Then one of the elders said to me,
"Stop crying. Look! The Lion from the
tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has
been victorious so that He may open the
scroll and its seven seals."
6 Then I saw one like a slaughtered
lamb standing between the throne and
the four living creatures and among the
elders. He had seven horns and sevenREVELATION 5
18
eyes, which are the seven spirits of God
sent into all the earth.
7 He came and took the scroll out of
the right hand of the One seated on the
throne.
8 When He took the scroll, the four
living creatures and the 24 elders fell
down before the Lamb. Each one had a
harp and gold bowls ﬁlled with incense,
which are the prayers of the saints.
9 And they sang a new song: You are
worthy to take the scroll and to open its
seals; because You were slaughtered,
and You redeemed people for God
by Your blood from every tribe and
language and people and na on.
10 You made them a kingdom and
priests to our God, and they will reign on
the earth.
11 Then I looked, and heard the voice of
many angels around the throne, and also
of the living creatures, and of the elders.REVELATION 5 – 6
19
Their number was countless thousands,
plus thousands of thousands.
12 They said with a loud voice: The
Lamb who was slaughtered is worthy to
receive power and riches and wisdom
and strength and honor and glory and
blessing!
13 I heard every creature in heaven, on
earth, under the earth, on the sea, and
everything in them say: Blessing and
honor and glory and dominion to the
One seated on the throne, and to the
Lamb, forever and ever!
14 The four living creatures said,
"Amen," and the elders fell down and
worshiped.
1 Then I saw the Lamb open one of
the seven seals, and I heard one of
the four living creatures say with a voice
like thunder, "Come!"
2 I looked, and there was a white horse.
The horseman on it had a bow; a crown
6REVELATION 6
20
was given to him, and he went out as a
victor to conquer.
3 When He opened the second seal,
I heard the second living creature say,
"Come!"
4 Then another horse went out, a
ﬁery red one, and its horseman was
empowered to take peace from the
earth, so that people would slaughter
one another. And a large sword was
given to him.
5 When He opened the third seal,
I heard the third living creature say,
"Come!" And I looked, and there was a
black horse. The horseman on it had a
balance scale in his hand.
6 Then I heard something like a voice
among the four living creatures say, "A
quart of wheat for a denarius, and three
quarts of barley for a denarius--but do
not harm the olive oil and the wine."REVELATION 6
21
7 When He opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth living
creature say, "Come!"
8 And I looked, and there was a pale
green horse. The horseman on it was
named Death, and Hades was following
a er him. Authority was given to them
over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the
sword, by famine, by plague, and by the
wild animals of the earth.
9 When He opened the ﬁ h seal, I
saw under the altar the souls of those
slaughtered because of God's word and
the tes mony they had.
10 They cried out with a loud voice: "O
Lord, holy and true, how long un l You
judge and avenge our blood from those
who live on the earth?"
11 So a white robe was given to each of
them, and they were told to rest a li le
while longer un l the number of their
fellow slaves and their brothers, whoREVELATION 6
22
were going to be killed just as they had
been, would be completed.
12 Then I saw Him open the sixth seal.
A violent earthquake occurred; the sun
turned black like sackcloth made of goat
hair; the en re moon became like blood;
13 the stars of heaven fell to the earth
as a ﬁg tree drops its unripe ﬁgs when
shaken by a high wind;
14 the sky separated like a scroll being
rolled up; and every mountain and island
was moved from its place.
15 Then the kings of the earth, the
nobles, the military commanders, the
rich, the powerful, and every slave and
free person hid in the caves and among
the rocks of the mountains.
16 And they said to the mountains and
to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from
the face of the One seated on the throne
and from the wrath of the Lamb,REVELATION 6 – 7
23
17 because the great day of Their wrath
has come! And who is able to stand?"
1 A er this I saw four angels standing
at the four corners of the earth,
restraining the four winds of the earth
so that no wind could blow on the earth
or on the sea or on any tree.
2 Then I saw another angel rise up from
the east, who had the seal of the living
God. He cried out in a loud voice to the
four angels who were empowered to
harm the earth and the sea:
3 "Don't harm the earth or the sea or
the trees un l we seal the slaves of our
God on their foreheads."
4 And I heard the number of those who
were sealed: 144,000 sealed from every
tribe of the sons of Israel:
5 12,000 sealed from the tribe of Judah,
12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000
from the tribe of Gad,
7REVELATION 7
24
6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000
from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from
the tribe of Manasseh,
7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,
12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000
from the tribe of Issachar,
8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,
12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000
sealed from the tribe of Benjamin.
9 A er this I looked, and there was
a vast mul tude from every na on,
tribe, people, and language, which no
one could number, standing before the
throne and before the Lamb. They were
robed in white with palm branches in
their hands.
10 And they cried out in a loud voice:
Salva on belongs to our God, who is
seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!
11 All the angels stood around the
throne, the elders, and the four livingREVELATION 7
25
creatures, and they fell on their faces
before the throne and worshiped God,
12 saying: Amen! Blessing and glory and
wisdom and thanksgiving and honor
and power and strength, be to our God
forever and ever. Amen.
13 Then one of the elders asked me,
"Who are these people robed in white,
and where did they come from?"
14 I said to him, "Sir, you know." Then he
told me: These are the ones coming out
of the great tribula on. They washed
their robes and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb.
15 For this reason they are before the
throne of God, and they serve Him day
and night in His sanctuary. The One
seated on the throne will shelter them:
16 no longer will they hunger; no longer
will they thirst; no longer will the sun
strike them, or any heat.REVELATION 7 – 8
26
17 Because the Lamb who is at the
center of the throne will shepherd them;
He will guide them to springs of living
waters, and God will wipe away every
tear from their eyes.
1 When He opened the seventh
seal, there was silence in heaven for
about half an hour.
2 Then I saw the seven angels who
stand in the presence of God; seven
trumpets were given to them.
3 Another angel, with a gold incense
burner, came and stood at the altar. He
was given a large amount of incense to
oﬀer with the prayers of all the saints on
the gold altar in front of the throne.
4 The smoke of the incense, with the
prayers of the saints, went up in the
presence of God from the angel's hand.
5 The angel took the incense burner,
ﬁlled it with ﬁre from the altar, and
hurled it to the earth; there were
8REVELATION 8
27
thunders, rumblings, lightnings, and an
earthquake.
6 And the seven angels who had the
seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
7 The ﬁrst angel blew his trumpet, and
hail and ﬁre, mixed with blood, were
hurled to the earth. So a third of the
earth was burned up, a third of the trees
were burned up, and all the green grass
was burned up.
8 The second angel blew his trumpet,
and something like a great mountain
ablaze with ﬁre was hurled into the sea.
So a third of the sea became blood,
9 a third of the living creatures in the
sea died, and a third of the ships were
destroyed.
10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and
a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from
heaven. It fell on a third of the rivers and
springs of water.REVELATION 8 – 9
28
11 The name of the star is Wormwood,
and a third of the waters became
wormwood. So, many of the people died
from the waters, because they had been
made bi er.
12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet,
and a third of the sun was struck, a third
of the moon, and a third of the stars, so
that a third of them were darkened. A
third of the day was without light, and
the night as well.
13 I looked, and I heard an eagle, ﬂying
in mid-heaven, saying in a loud voice,
"Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on
the earth, because of the remaining
trumpet blasts that the three angels are
about to sound!"
1 The ﬁ h angel blew his trumpet,
and I saw a star that had fallen from
heaven to earth. The key to the sha of
the abyss was given to him.
9REVELATION 9
2 He opened the sha
29
of the abyss,
and smoke came up out of the sha like
smoke from a great furnace so that the
sun and the air were darkened by the
smoke from the sha .
3 Then out of the smoke locusts came
to the earth, and power was given to
them like the power that scorpions have
on the earth.
4 They were told not to harm the grass
of the earth, or any green plant, or any
tree, but only people who do not have
God's seal on their foreheads.
5 They were not permi ed to kill
them, but were to torment them for
ﬁve months; their torment is like the
torment caused by a scorpion when it
strikes a man.
6 In those days people will seek death
and will not ﬁnd it; they will long to die,
but death will ﬂee from them.REVELATION 9
30
7 The appearance of the locusts was
like horses equipped for ba le. On their
heads were something like gold crowns;
their faces were like men's faces;
8 they had hair like women's hair; their
teeth were like lions' teeth;
9 they had chests like iron breastplates;
the sound of their wings was like the
sound of chariots with many horses
rushing into ba le;
10 and they had tails with s ngers, like
scorpions, so that with their tails they
had the power to harm people for ﬁve
months.
11 They had as their king the angel
of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is
Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name
Apollyon.
12 The ﬁrst woe has passed. There are
s ll two more woes to come a er this.REVELATION 9
31
13 The sixth angel blew his trumpet.
From the four horns of the gold altar
that is before God, I heard a voice
14 say to the sixth angel who had the
trumpet, "Release the four angels bound
at the great river Euphrates."
15 So the four angels who were
prepared for the hour, day, month, and
year were released to kill a third of the
human race.
16 The number of mounted troops was
200 million; I heard their number.
17 This is how I saw the horses in my
vision: The horsemen had breastplates
that were ﬁery red, hyacinth blue, and
sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses
were like lions' heads, and from their
mouths came ﬁre, smoke, and sulfur.
18 A third of the human race was killed
by these three plagues--by the ﬁre, the
smoke, and the sulfur that came from
their mouths.REVELATION 9 – 10
32
19 For the power of the horses is in their
mouths and in their tails, because their
tails, like snakes, have heads, and they
inﬂict injury with them.
20 The rest of the people, who were not
killed by these plagues, did not repent
of the works of their hands to stop
worshiping demons and idols of gold,
silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which
are not able to see, hear, or walk.
21 And they did not repent of their
murders, their sorceries, their sexual
immorality, or their the s.
1 Then I saw another mighty
angel coming down from heaven,
surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow
over his head. His face was like the sun,
his legs were like ﬁery pillars,
2 and he had a li le scroll opened in his
hand. He put his right foot on the sea,
his le on the land,
10REVELATION 10
33
3 and he cried out with a loud voice like
a roaring lion. When he cried out, the
seven thunders spoke with their voices.
4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I
was about to write. Then I heard a voice
from heaven, saying, "Seal up what the
seven thunders said, and do not write it
down!"
5 Then the angel that I had seen
standing on the sea and on the land
raised his right hand to heaven.
6 He swore an oath by the One who
lives forever and ever, who created
heaven and what is in it, the earth and
what is in it, and the sea and what is in
it: "There will no longer be an interval of
me,
7 but in the days of the sound of the
seventh angel, when he will blow his
trumpet, then God's hidden plan will
be completed, as He announced to His
servants the prophets."REVELATION 10 – 11
34
8 Now the voice that I heard from
heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go,
take the scroll that lies open in the hand
of the angel who is standing on the sea
and on the land."
9 So I went to the angel and asked him
to give me the li le scroll. He said to me,
"Take and eat it; it will be bi er in your
stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey
in your mouth."
10 Then I took the li le scroll from the
angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet
as honey in my mouth, but when I ate it,
my stomach became bi er.
11 And I was told, "You must prophesy
again about many peoples, na ons,
languages, and kings."
1 Then I was given a measuring
reed like a rod, with these words:
"Go and measure God's sanctuary and
the altar, and count those who worship
there.
11REVELATION 11
35
2 But exclude the courtyard outside the
sanctuary. Don't measure it, because
it is given to the na ons, and they will
trample the holy city for 42 months.
3 I will empower my two witnesses,
and they will prophesy for 1,260 days,
dressed in sackcloth."
4 These are the two olive trees and the
two lampstands that stand before the
Lord of the earth.
5 If anyone wants to harm them, ﬁre
comes from their mouths and consumes
their enemies; if anyone wants to harm
them, he must be killed in this way.
6 These men have the power to close
the sky so that it does not rain during the
days of their prophecy. They also have
power over the waters to turn them into
blood, and to strike the earth with any
plague whenever they want.
7 When they ﬁnish their tes mony, the
beast that comes up out of the abyssREVELATION 11
36
will make war with them, conquer them,
and kill them.
8 Their dead bodies will lie in the public
square of the great city, which is called,
prophe cally, Sodom and Egypt, where
also their Lord was cruciﬁed.
9 And representa ves from the peoples,
tribes, languages, and na ons will view
their bodies for three and a half days
and not permit their bodies to be put
into a tomb.
10 Those who live on the earth will
gloat over them and celebrate and send
gi s to one another, because these two
prophets tormented those who live on
the earth.
11 But a er the three and a half days,
the breath of life from God entered
them, and they stood on their feet. So
great fear fell on those who saw them.
12 Then they heard a loud voice from
heaven saying to them, "Come up here."REVELATION 11
37
They went up to heaven in a cloud, while
their enemies watched them.
13 At that moment a violent earthquake
took place, a tenth of the city fell,
and 7,000 people were killed in the
earthquake. The survivors were terriﬁed
and gave glory to the God of heaven.
14 The second woe has passed. Take
note: the third woe is coming quickly!
15 The seventh angel blew his trumpet,
and there were loud voices in heaven
saying: The kingdom of the world has
become the kingdom of our Lord and of
His Messiah, and He will reign forever
and ever!
16 The 24 elders, who were seated
before God on their thrones, fell on their
faces and worshiped God,
17 saying: We thank You, Lord God, the
Almighty, who is and who was, because
You have taken Your great power and
have begun to reign.REVELATION 11 – 12
18 The na
38
ons were angry, but Your
wrath has come. The me has come for
the dead to be judged, and to give the
reward to Your servants the prophets, to
the saints, and to those who fear Your
name, both small and great, and the
me has come to destroy those who
destroy the earth.
19 God's sanctuary in heaven was
opened, and the ark of His covenant
appeared in His sanctuary. There were
lightnings, rumblings, thunders, an
earthquake, and severe hail.
1 A great sign appeared in heaven:
a woman clothed with the sun,
with the moon under her feet, and a
crown of 12 stars on her head.
2 She was pregnant and cried out in
labor and agony to give birth.
3 Then another sign appeared in
heaven: There was a great ﬁery red
dragon having seven heads and 10
12REVELATION 12
39
horns, and on his heads were seven
diadems.
4 His tail swept away a third of the stars
in heaven and hurled them to the earth.
And the dragon stood in front of the
woman who was about to give birth, so
that when she did give birth he might
devour her child.
5 But she gave birth to a Son--a male
who is going to shepherd all na ons
with an iron scepter--and her child was
caught up to God and to His throne.
6 The woman ﬂed into the wilderness,
where she had a place prepared by God,
to be fed there for 1,260 days.
7 Then war broke out in heaven:
Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon. The dragon and his angels
also fought,
8 but he could not prevail, and there
was no place for them in heaven any
longer.REVELATION 12
40
9 So the great dragon was thrown
out--the ancient serpent, who is called
the Devil and Satan, the one who
deceives the whole world. He was
thrown to earth, and his angels with
him.
10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven
say: The salva on and the power and the
kingdom of our God and the authority
of His Messiah have now come, because
the accuser of our brothers has been
thrown out: the one who accuses them
before our God day and night.
11 They conquered him by the blood
of the Lamb and by the word of their
tes mony, for they did not love their
lives in the face of death.
12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and
you who dwell in them! Woe to the
earth and the sea, for the Devil has come
down to you with great fury, because he
knows he has a short me.REVELATION 12 – 13
41
13 When the dragon saw that he had
been thrown to earth, he persecuted the
woman who gave birth to the male.
14 The woman was given two wings of
a great eagle, so that she could ﬂy from
the serpent's presence to her place in
the wilderness, where she was fed for a
me, mes, and half a me.
15 From his mouth the serpent spewed
water like a river a er the woman, to
sweep her away in a torrent.
16 But the earth helped the woman: the
earth opened its mouth and swallowed
up the river that the dragon had spewed
from his mouth.
17 So the dragon was furious with the
woman and le to wage war against the
rest of her oﬀspring--those who keep
the commandments of God and have
the tes mony about Jesus.
1 (12:18) (He stood on the sand
of the sea.) And I saw a beast
13REVELATION 13
42
coming up out of the sea. He had 10
horns and seven heads. On his horns
were 10 diadems, and on his heads were
blasphemous names.
2 The beast I saw was like a leopard, his
feet were like a bear's, and his mouth
was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave
him his power, his throne, and great
authority.
3 One of his heads appeared to be
fatally wounded, but his fatal wound was
healed. The whole earth was amazed
and followed the beast.
4 They worshiped the dragon because
he gave authority to the beast. And they
worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is
like the beast? Who is able to wage war
against him?"
5 A mouth was given to him to speak
boasts and blasphemies. He was also
given authority to act for 42 months.REVELATION 13
43
6 He began to speak blasphemies
against God: to blaspheme His name and
His dwelling--those who dwell in heaven.
7 And he was permi ed to wage war
against the saints and to conquer them.
He was also given authority over every
tribe, people, language, and na on.
8 All those who live on the earth will
worship him, everyone whose name was
not wri en from the founda on of the
world in the book of life of the Lamb
who was slaughtered.
9 If anyone has an ear, he should listen:
10 If anyone is des ned for cap vity,
into cap vity he goes. If anyone is to be
killed with a sword, with a sword he will
be killed. Here is the endurance and the
faith of the saints.
11 Then I saw another beast coming up
out of the earth; he had two horns like a
lamb, but he sounded like a dragon.REVELATION 13
44
12 He exercises all the authority of the
ﬁrst beast on his behalf and compels the
earth and those who live on it to worship
the ﬁrst beast, whose fatal wound was
healed.
13 He also performs great signs, even
causing ﬁre to come down from heaven
to earth before people.
14 He deceives those who live on the
earth because of the signs that he is
permi ed to perform on behalf of the
beast, telling those who live on the earth
to make an image of the beast who had
the sword wound yet lived.
15 He was permi ed to give a spirit to
the image of the beast, so that the image
of the beast could both speak and cause
whoever would not worship the image
of the beast to be killed.
16 And he requires everyone--small and
great, rich and poor, free and slave--toREVELATION 13 – 14
45
be given a mark on his right hand or on
his forehead,
17 so that no one can buy or sell unless
he has the mark: the beast's name or
the number of his name.
18 Here is wisdom: The one who has
understanding must calculate the
number of the beast, because it is the
number of a man. His number is 666.
1 Then I looked, and there on
Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and
with Him were 144,000 who had His
name and His Father's name wri en on
their foreheads.
2 I heard a sound from heaven like the
sound of cascading waters and like the
rumbling of loud thunder. The sound I
heard was also like harpists playing on
their harps.
3 They sang a new song before the
throne and before the four living
creatures and the elders, but no one
14REVELATION 14
46
could learn the song except the 144,000
who had been redeemed from the earth.
4 These are the ones not deﬁled with
women, for they have kept their virginity.
These are the ones who follow the Lamb
wherever He goes. They were redeemed
from the human race as the ﬁrs ruits for
God and the Lamb.
5 No lie was found in their mouths; they
are blameless.
6 Then I saw another angel ﬂying in
mid-heaven, having the eternal gospel
to announce to the inhabitants of the
earth--to every na on, tribe, language,
and people.
7 He spoke with a loud voice: "Fear God
and give Him glory, because the hour
of His judgment has come. Worship the
Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and
springs of water."
8 A second angel followed, saying: "It
has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen,REVELATION 14
47
who made all na ons drink the wine
of her sexual immorality, which brings
wrath."
9 And a third angel followed them and
spoke with a loud voice: "If anyone
worships the beast and his image and
receives a mark on his forehead or on
his hand,
10 he will also drink the wine of God's
wrath, which is mixed full strength in the
cup of His anger. He will be tormented
with ﬁre and sulfur in the sight of the
holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb,
11 and the smoke of their torment will
go up forever and ever. There is no rest
day or night for those who worship the
beast and his image, or anyone who
receives the mark of his name.
12 Here is the endurance of the saints,
who keep the commandments of God
and the faith in Jesus."REVELATION 14
48
13 Then I heard a voice from heaven
saying, "Write: Blessed are the dead
who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes,"
says the Spirit, "let them rest from their
labors, for their works follow them!"
14 Then I looked, and there was a white
cloud, and One like the Son of Man was
seated on the cloud, with a gold crown
on His head and a sharp sickle in His
hand.
15 Another angel came out of the
sanctuary, crying out in a loud voice to
the One who was seated on the cloud,
"Use your sickle and reap, for the me
to reap has come, since the harvest of
the earth is ripe."
16 So the One seated on the cloud
swung His sickle over the earth, and the
earth was harvested.
17 Then another angel who also had a
sharp sickle came out of the sanctuary in
heaven.REVELATION 14 – 15
49
18 Yet another angel, who had authority
over ﬁre, came from the altar, and he
called with a loud voice to the one who
had the sharp sickle, "Use your sharp
sickle and gather the clusters of grapes
from earth's vineyard, because its grapes
have ripened."
19 So the angel swung his sickle toward
earth and gathered the grapes from
earth's vineyard, and he threw them into
the great winepress of God's wrath.
20 Then the press was trampled outside
the city, and blood ﬂowed out of the
press up to the horses' bridles for about
180 miles.
1 Then I saw another great and
awe-inspiring sign in heaven:
seven angels with the seven last plagues,
for with them, God's wrath will be
completed.
2 I also saw something like a sea of
glass mixed with ﬁre, and those who
15REVELATION 15
50
had won the victory from the beast, his
image, and the number of his name,
were standing on the sea of glass with
harps from God.
3 They sang the song of God's servant
Moses, and the song of the Lamb: Great
and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord
God, the Almighty; righteous and true
are Your ways, King of the Na ons.
4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify
Your name? Because You alone are
holy, because all the na ons will come
and worship before You, because Your
righteous acts have been revealed.
5 A er this I looked, and the heavenly
sanctuary--the tabernacle of tes mony--
was opened.
6 Out of the sanctuary came the seven
angels with the seven plagues, dressed
in clean, bright linen, with gold sashes
wrapped around their chests.REVELATION 15 – 16
51
7 One of the four living creatures gave
the seven angels seven gold bowls ﬁlled
with the wrath of God who lives forever
and ever.
8 Then the sanctuary was ﬁlled with
smoke from God's glory and from His
power, and no one could enter the
sanctuary un l the seven plagues of the
seven angels were completed.
1 Then I heard a loud voice from
the sanctuary saying to the seven
angels, "Go and pour out the seven
bowls of God's wrath on the earth."
2 The ﬁrst went and poured out his bowl
on the earth, and severely painful sores
broke out on the people who had the
mark of the beast and who worshiped
his image.
3 The second poured out his bowl into
the sea. It turned to blood like a dead
man's, and all life in the sea died.
16REVELATION 16
52
4 The third poured out his bowl into the
rivers and the springs of water, and they
became blood.
5 I heard the angel of the waters say:
You are righteous, who is and who was,
the Holy One, for You have decided
these things.
6 Because they poured out the blood
of the saints and the prophets, You also
gave them blood to drink; they deserve
it!
7 Then I heard someone from the altar
say: Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true
and righteous are Your judgments.
8 The fourth poured out his bowl on the
sun. He was given the power to burn
people with ﬁre,
9 and people were burned by the
intense heat. So they blasphemed the
name of God who had the power over
these plagues, and they did not repent
and give Him glory.REVELATION 16
10 The ﬁ
53
h poured out his bowl on the
throne of the beast, and his kingdom
was plunged into darkness. People
gnawed their tongues from pain
11 and blasphemed the God of heaven
because of their pains and their sores,
yet they did not repent of their ac ons.
12 The sixth poured out his bowl on the
great river Euphrates, and its water was
dried up to prepare the way for the kings
from the east.
13 Then I saw three unclean spirits like
frogs coming from the dragon's mouth,
from the beast's mouth, and from the
mouth of the false prophet.
14 For they are spirits of demons
performing signs, who travel to the kings
of the whole world to assemble them for
the ba le of the great day of God, the
Almighty.
15 "Look, I am coming like a thief.
Blessed is the one who is alert andREVELATION 16
54
remains clothed so that he may not go
naked, and they see his shame."
16 So they assembled them at the place
called in Hebrew Armagedon.
17 Then the seventh poured out his
bowl into the air, and a loud voice came
out of the sanctuary, from the throne,
saying, "It is done!"
18 There were lightnings, rumblings,
and thunders. And a severe earthquake
occurred like no other since man has
been on the earth--so great was the
quake.
19 The great city split into three parts,
and the ci es of the na ons fell. Babylon
the Great was remembered in God's
presence; He gave her the cup ﬁlled with
the wine of His ﬁerce anger.
20 Every island ﬂed, and the mountains
disappeared.
21 Enormous hailstones, each weighing
about 100 pounds, fell from heavenREVELATION 17
55
on the people, and they blasphemed
God for the plague of hail because that
plague was extremely severe.
1 Then one of the seven angels
who had the seven bowls came
and spoke with me: "Come, I will show
you the judgment of the notorious
pros tute who sits on many waters.
2 The kings of the earth commi ed
sexual immorality with her, and those
who live on the earth became drunk on
the wine of her sexual immorality."
3 So he carried me away in the Spirit
to a desert. I saw a woman si ng on
a scarlet beast that was covered with
blasphemous names, having seven
heads and 10 horns.
4 The woman was dressed in purple
and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious
stones, and pearls. She had a gold cup in
her hand ﬁlled with everything vile and
with the impuri es of her pros tu on.
17REVELATION 17
5 On her forehead a cryp
56
c name
was wri en: BABYLON THE GREAT THE
MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE
VILE THINGS OF THE EARTH
6 Then I saw that the woman was drunk
on the blood of the saints and on the
blood of the witnesses to Jesus. When I
saw her, I was u erly astounded.
7 Then the angel said to me, "Why are
you astounded? I will tell you the secret
meaning of the woman and of the beast,
with the seven heads and the 10 horns,
that carries her.
8 The beast that you saw was, and is
not, and is about to come up from the
abyss and go to destruc on. Those who
live on the earth whose names were
not wri en in the book of life from
the founda on of the world will be
astounded when they see the beast that
was, and is not, and will be present again
.REVELATION 17
57
9 "Here is the mind with wisdom: the
seven heads are seven mountains on
which the woman is seated.
10 They are also seven kings: ﬁve have
fallen, one is, the other has not yet
come, and when he comes, he must
remain for a li le while.
11 The beast that was and is not, is
himself the eighth, yet is of the seven
and goes to destruc on.
12 The 10 horns you saw are 10 kings
who have not yet received a kingdom,
but they will receive authority as kings
with the beast for one hour.
13 These have one purpose, and they
give their power and authority to the
beast.
14 These will make war against the
Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them
because He is Lord of lords and King of
kings. Those with Him are called and
elect and faithful."REVELATION 17 – 18
58
15 He also said to me, "The waters you
saw, where the pros tute was seated,
are peoples, mul tudes, na ons, and
languages.
16 The 10 horns you saw, and the beast,
will hate the pros tute. They will make
her desolate and naked, devour her
ﬂesh, and burn her up with ﬁre.
17 For God has put it into their hearts to
carry out His plan by having one purpose,
and to give their kingdom to the beast
un l God's words are accomplished.
18 And the woman you saw is the great
city that has an empire over the kings of
the earth."
1 A er this I saw another angel
with great authority coming
down from heaven, and the earth was
illuminated by his splendor.
2 He cried in a mighty voice: It has
fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen! She
has become a dwelling for demons, a
18REVELATION 18
59
haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt
for every unclean bird, and a haunt for
every unclean and despicable beast.
3 For all the na ons have drunk the
wine of her sexual immorality, which
brings wrath. The kings of the earth
have commi ed sexual immorality with
her, and the merchants of the earth
have grown wealthy from her excessive
luxury.
4 Then I heard another voice from
heaven: Come out of her, My people,
so that you will not share in her sins, or
receive any of her plagues.
5 For her sins are piled up to heaven,
and God has remembered her crimes.
6 Pay her back the way she also paid,
and double it according to her works.
In the cup in which she mixed, mix a
double por on for her.
7 As much as she gloriﬁed herself and
lived luxuriously, give her that muchREVELATION 18
60
torment and grief. Because she says in
her heart, 'I sit as queen; I am not a
widow, and I will never see grief,'
8 therefore her plagues will come in one
day--death, and grief, and famine. She
will be burned up with ﬁre, because the
Lord God who judges her is mighty.
9 The kings of the earth who have
commi ed sexual immorality and lived
luxuriously with her will weep and
mourn over her when they see the
smoke of her burning.
10 They stand far oﬀ in fear of her
torment, saying: Woe, woe, the great
city, Babylon, the mighty city! For in a
single hour your judgment has come.
11 The merchants of the earth will also
weep and mourn over her, because no
one buys their merchandise any longer--
12 merchandise of gold, silver, precious
stones, and pearls; ﬁne fabrics of linen,
purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds ofREVELATION 18
61
fragrant wood products; objects of ivory;
objects of expensive wood, brass, iron,
and marble;
13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and
frankincense; wine, olive oil, ﬁne wheat
ﬂour, and grain; ca le and sheep; horses
and carriages; and human bodies and
souls.
14 The fruit you craved has le you. All
your splendid and glamorous things are
gone; they will never ﬁnd them again.
15 The merchants of these things, who
became rich from her, will stand far oﬀ
in fear of her torment, weeping and
mourning,
16 saying: Woe, woe, the great city,
clothed in ﬁne linen, purple, and scarlet,
adorned with gold, precious stones, and
pearls;
17 because in a single hour such
fabulous wealth was destroyed! And
every shipmaster, seafarer, the sailors,REVELATION 18
62
and all who do business by sea, stood far
oﬀ
18 as they watched the smoke from her
burning and kept crying out: "Who is like
the great city?"
19 They threw dust on their heads and
kept crying out, weeping, and mourning:
Woe, woe, the great city, where all those
who have ships on the sea became rich
from her wealth; because in a single
hour she was destroyed.
20 Rejoice over her, heaven, and you
saints, apostles, and prophets, because
God has executed your judgment on her!
21 Then a mighty angel picked up a
stone like a large millstone and threw it
into the sea, saying: In this way, Babylon
the great city will be thrown down
violently and never be found again.
22 The sound of harpists, musicians,
ﬂu sts, and trumpeters will never be
heard in you again; no cra sman of anyREVELATION 18 – 19
63
trade will ever be found in you again;
the sound of a mill will never be heard in
you again;
23 the light of a lamp will never shine in
you again; and the voice of a groom and
bride will never be heard in you again. All
this will happen because your merchants
were the nobility of the earth, because
all the na ons were deceived by your
sorcery,
24 and the blood of prophets and saints,
and all those slaughtered on earth, was
found in you.
1 A er this I heard something like
the loud voice of a vast mul tude
in heaven, saying: Hallelujah! Salva on,
glory, and power belong to our God,
2 because His judgments are true and
righteous, because He has judged the
notorious pros tute who corrupted the
earth with her sexual immorality; and He
19REVELATION 19
64
has avenged the blood of His servants
that was on her hands.
3 A second me they said: Hallelujah!
Her smoke ascends forever and ever!
4 Then the 24 elders and the four living
creatures fell down and worshiped God,
who is seated on the throne, saying:
Amen! Hallelujah!
5 A voice came from the throne, saying:
Praise our God, all you His servants, you
who fear Him, both small and great!
6 Then I heard something like the
voice of a vast mul tude, like the
sound of cascading waters, and like
the rumbling of loud thunder, saying:
Hallelujah--because our Lord God, the
Almighty, has begun to reign!
7 Let us be glad, rejoice, and give Him
glory, because the marriage of the Lamb
has come, and His wife has prepared
herself.REVELATION 19
8 She was permi
65
ed to wear ﬁne linen,
bright and pure. For the ﬁne linen
represents the righteous acts of the
saints.
9 Then he said to me, "Write: Blessed
are those invited to the marriage feast
of the Lamb!" He also said to me, "These
words of God are true."
10 Then I fell at his feet to worship him,
but he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a
fellow slave with you and your brothers
who have the tes mony about Jesus.
Worship God, because the tes mony
about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and there
was a white horse! Its rider is called
Faithful and True, and in righteousness
He judges and makes war.
12 His eyes were like a ﬁery ﬂame, and
on His head were many crowns. He had a
name wri en that no one knows except
Himself.REVELATION 19
66
13 He wore a robe stained with blood,
and His name is called the Word of God.
14 The armies that were in heaven
followed Him on white horses, wearing
pure white linen.
15 From His mouth came a sharp sword,
so that with it He might strike the
na ons. He will shepherd them with an
iron scepter. He will also trample the
winepress of the ﬁerce anger of God, the
Almighty.
16 And on His robe and on His thigh He
has a name wri en: KING OF KINGS AND
LORD OF LORDS
17 Then I saw an angel standing in
the sun, and he cried out in a loud
voice, saying to all the birds ﬂying in
mid-heaven, "Come, gather together for
the great supper of God,
18 so that you may eat the ﬂesh of kings,
the ﬂesh of commanders, the ﬂesh of
mighty men, the ﬂesh of horses and ofREVELATION 19 – 20
67
their riders, and the ﬂesh of everyone,
both free and slave, small and great."
19 Then I saw the beast, the kings of
the earth, and their armies gathered
together to wage war against the rider
on the horse and against His army.
20 But the beast was taken prisoner, and
along with him the false prophet, who
had performed signs on his authority, by
which he deceived those who accepted
the mark of the beast and those who
worshiped his image. Both of them were
thrown alive into the lake of ﬁre that
burns with sulfur.
21 The rest were killed with the sword
that came from the mouth of the rider
on the horse, and all the birds were ﬁlled
with their ﬂesh.
1 Then I saw an angel coming
down from heaven with the key
to the abyss and a great chain in his
hand.
20REVELATION 20
68
2 He seized the dragon, that ancient
serpent who is the Devil and Satan, and
bound him for 1,000 years.
3 He threw him into the abyss, closed
it, and put a seal on it so that he would
no longer deceive the na ons un l the
1,000 years were completed. A er that,
he must be released for a short me.
4 Then I saw thrones, and people seated
on them who were given authority to
judge. I also saw the souls of those who
had been beheaded because of their
tes mony about Jesus and because of
God's word, who had not worshiped the
beast or his image, and who had not
accepted the mark on their foreheads
or their hands. They came to life and
reigned with the Messiah for 1,000
years.
5 The rest of the dead did not come
to life un l the 1,000 years were
completed. This is the ﬁrst resurrec on.REVELATION 20
69
6 Blessed and holy is the one who
shares in the ﬁrst resurrec on! The
second death has no power over these,
but they will be priests of God and the
Messiah, and they will reign with Him for
1,000 years.
7 When the 1,000 years are completed,
Satan will be released from his prison
8 and will go out to deceive the na ons
at the four corners of the earth, Gog and
Magog, to gather them for ba le. Their
number is like the sand of the sea.
9 They came up over the surface of the
earth and surrounded the encampment
of the saints, the beloved city. Then ﬁre
came down from heaven and consumed
them.
10 The Devil who deceived them was
thrown into the lake of ﬁre and sulfur
where the beast and the false prophet
are, and they will be tormented day and
night forever and ever.REVELATION 20 – 21
70
11 Then I saw a great white throne and
One seated on it. Earth and heaven ﬂed
from His presence, and no place was
found for them.
12 I also saw the dead, the great and the
small, standing before the throne, and
books were opened. Another book was
opened, which is the book of life, and
the dead were judged according to their
works by what was wri en in the books.
13 Then the sea gave up its dead, and
Death and Hades gave up their dead; all
were judged according to their works.
14 Death and Hades were thrown into
the lake of ﬁre. This is the second death,
the lake of ﬁre.
15 And anyone not found wri en in the
book of life was thrown into the lake of
ﬁre.
1 Then I saw a new heaven and
a new earth, for the ﬁrst heaven
21REVELATION 21
71
and the ﬁrst earth had passed away, and
the sea existed no longer.
2 I also saw the Holy City, new
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
from God, prepared like a bride adorned
for her husband.
3 Then I heard a loud voice from the
throne: Look! God's dwelling is with
men, and He will live with them. They
will be His people, and God Himself will
be with them and be their God.
4 He will wipe away every tear from
their eyes. Death will exist no longer;
grief, crying, and pain will exist no longer,
because the previous things have passed
away.
5 Then the One seated on the throne
said, "Look! I am making everything
new." He also said, "Write, because
these words are faithful and true."
6 And He said to me, "It is done! I am
the Alpha and the Omega, the BeginningREVELATION 21
72
and the End. I will give to the thirsty
from the spring of living water as a gi .
7 The victor will inherit these things,
and I will be his God, and he will be My
son.
8 But the cowards, unbelievers, vile,
murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers,
idolaters, and all liars--their share will
be in the lake that burns with ﬁre and
sulfur, which is the second death."
9 Then one of the seven angels, who
had held the seven bowls ﬁlled with the
seven last plagues, came and spoke with
me: "Come, I will show you the bride,
the wife of the Lamb."
10 He then carried me away in the
Spirit to a great and high mountain and
showed me the holy city, Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God,
11 arrayed with God's glory. Her
radiance was like a very precious stone,
like a jasper stone, bright as crystal.REVELATION 21
73
12 The city had a massive high wall,
with 12 gates. Twelve angels were at
the gates; on the gates , names were
inscribed, the names of the 12 tribes of
the sons of Israel.
13 There were three gates on the east,
three gates on the north, three gates on
the south, and three gates on the west.
14 The city wall had 12 founda ons,
and on them were the 12 names of the
Lamb's 12 apostles.
15 The one who spoke with me had a
gold measuring rod to measure the city,
its gates, and its wall.
16 The city is laid out in a square; its
length and width are the same. He
measured the city with the rod at 12,000
stadia. Its length, width, and height are
equal.
17 Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits
according to human measurement,
which the angel used.REVELATION 21
74
18 The building material of its wall was
jasper, and the city was pure gold like
clear glass.
19 The founda ons of the city wall were
adorned with every kind of precious
stone: the ﬁrst founda on jasper, the
second sapphire, the third chalcedony,
the fourth emerald,
20 the ﬁ h sardonyx, the sixth carnelian,
the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl,
the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase,
the eleventh jacinth, the twel h
amethyst.
21 The 12 gates are 12 pearls; each
individual gate was made of a single
pearl. The broad street of the city was
pure gold, like transparent glass.
22 I did not see a sanctuary in it, because
the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
are its sanctuary.REVELATION 21 – 22
75
23 The city does not need the sun or the
moon to shine on it, because God's glory
illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
24 The na ons will walk in its light, and
the kings of the earth will bring their
glory into it.
25 Each day its gates will never close
because it will never be night there.
26 They will bring the glory and honor
of the na ons into it.
27 Nothing profane will ever enter it: no
one who does what is vile or false, but
only those wri en in the Lamb's book of
life.
1 Then he showed me the river of
living water, sparkling like crystal,
ﬂowing from the throne of God and of
the Lamb
2 down the middle of the broad street
of the city . On both sides of the river
was the tree of life bearing 12 kinds of
fruit, producing its fruit every month.
22REVELATION 22
76
The leaves of the tree are for healing the
na ons,
3 and there will no longer be any curse.
The throne of God and of the Lamb will
be in the city, and His servants will serve
Him.
4 They will see His face, and His name
will be on their foreheads.
5 Night will no longer exist, and people
will not need lamplight or sunlight,
because the Lord God will give them
light. And they will reign forever and
ever.
6 Then he said to me, "These words
are faithful and true. And the Lord, the
God of the spirits of the prophets, has
sent His angel to show His servants what
must quickly take place."
7 "Look, I am coming quickly! Blessed is
the one who keeps the prophe c words
of this book."REVELATION 22
77
8 I, John, am the one who heard and
saw these things. When I heard and saw
them, I fell down to worship at the feet
of the angel who had shown them to
me.
9 But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am
a fellow slave with you, your brothers
the prophets, and those who keep the
words of this book. Worship God."
10 He also said to me, "Don't seal the
prophe c words of this book, because
the me is near.
11 Let the unrighteous go on in
unrighteousness; let the ﬁlthy go on
being made ﬁlthy; let the righteous go
on in righteousness; and let the holy go
on being made holy."
12 "Look! I am coming quickly, and My
reward is with Me to repay each person
according to what he has done.REVELATION 22
78
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
First and the Last, the Beginning and the
End.
14 "Blessed are those who wash their
robes, so that they may have the right to
the tree of life and may enter the city by
the gates.
15 Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,
the sexually immoral, the murderers, the
idolaters, and everyone who loves and
prac ces lying.
16 "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to a est
these things to you for the churches. I
am the Root and the Oﬀspring of David,
the Bright Morning Star."
17 Both the Spirit and the bride say,
"Come!" Anyone who hears should say,
"Come!" And the one who is thirsty
should come. Whoever desires should
take the living water as a gi .
18 I tes fy to everyone who hears the
prophe c words of this book: If anyoneREVELATION 22
79
adds to them, God will add to him the
plagues that are wri en in this book.
19 And if anyone takes away from the
words of this prophe c book, God will
take away his share of the tree of life and
the holy city, wri en in this book.
20 He who tes ﬁes about these things
says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen!
Come, Lord Jesus!
21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with
all the saints. Amen.
