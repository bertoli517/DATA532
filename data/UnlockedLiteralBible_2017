1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father
of Judah and his brothers. 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar,
Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram. 4 Ram was the father of
Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.
5 Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed the
father of Jesse. 6 Jesse was the father of David the king,
David the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah. 7 Solomon was the father of
Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa. 8 Asa was the
father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram an ancestor of
Uzziah. 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father
of Hezekiah. 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon,
and Amon the father of Josiah. 11 Josiah was an ancestor of Jechoniah and his brothers
at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
12 After the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel
was an ancestor of Zerubbabel. 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud the
father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor. 14 Azor was the father of Zadok,
Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud. 15 Eliud was the father
of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob. 16 Jacob
was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called
Christ. 17 All the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, from
David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation
to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
18 The birth of Jesus Christ happened in the following way. His mother, Mary, was
engaged to marry Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant
by the Holy Spirit. 19 Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man, and he did not want
to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to secretly end his engagement with her. 20 As
he thought about these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one
who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit. 21 She will give birth to a son,
and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 22 All
this happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
23 “Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call his name
Immanuel”—which means, “God with us.” 24 Joseph woke up from his sleep
and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and he took her as his wife.
25 But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son.
Then he called his name Jesus.

1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, learned
men from the east arrived in Jerusalem saying, 2 “Where is he who was born King of
the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.” 3 When Herod
the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 Herod brought
together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and he asked them, “Where is
the Christ to be born?” 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what
was written by the prophet,Matthew 2:6
1018
Matthew 3:7
6 'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
are not the least among the leaders of Judah,
for from you will come a ruler
who will shepherd my people Israel.'”
7 Then Herod secretly called the learned men to ask them exactly what time the star
had appeared. 8 He sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search carefully for the
young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come
and worship him.” 9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the
star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood still over
where the young child was. 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great
joy. 11 They went into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother. They
fell down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and offered him gifts
of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 12 God warned them in a dream not to return to
Herod, so they departed to their own country by another way.
13 After they had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and
said, “Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there
until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.” 14 That night
Joseph rose and took the young child and his mother and departed into Egypt. 15 He
remained there until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken
through the prophet, “Out of Egypt I have called my son.”
16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been mocked by the learned men, was
very angry. He sent and killed all the male children that were in Bethlehem and
in all that region who were two years old and under, according to the time that he
had determined exactly from the learned men. 17 Then was fulfilled what had been
spoken through Jeremiah the prophet,
18 “A voice was heard in Ramah,
weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children,
and she refused to be comforted, because they were no more.”
19 When Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph
in Egypt and said, 20 “Get up and take the child and his mother and go to the land
of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.” 21 Joseph rose, took the
child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that
Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to
go there. After God warned him in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee 23 and
went and lived in a city called Nazareth. This fulfilled what had been spoken through
the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

1 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying,
2 “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” 3 For this is he who was spoken of by
Isaiah the prophet, saying,
“The voice of one calling out in the wilderness,
'Make ready the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.'”
4 Now John wore clothing of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. His food
was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around
the Jordan River went out to him. 6 They were baptized by him in the Jordan River,
as they confessed their sins. 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees
coming to him for baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warnedMatthew 3:8
1019
Matthew 4:16
you to flee from the wrath that is coming? 8 Bear fruit worthy of repentance. 9 Do
not think of saying among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I say
to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones.
10 Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does
not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. 11 I baptize you
with water for repentance. But he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am
not worthy even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
with fire. 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing
floor and to gather his wheat into the storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with
fire that can never be put out.”
13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. 14 But
John kept trying to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come
to me?” 15 Jesus responded and said to him, “Permit it now, for it is right for us to
fulfill all righteousness.” Then John permitted him. 16 After he was baptized, Jesus
came up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him.
He saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting upon him. 17 Behold,
a voice came out of the heavens saying, “This is my beloved Son. I am very pleased
with him.”
4
1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
2 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 3 The tempter came
and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”
4 But Jesus answered and said to him, “It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread
alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.'” 5 Then the devil took
him into the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple building, 6 and
said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,
'He will command his angels to take care of you,'
and,
'They will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not hit your foot against a stone.'”
7 Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, 'You must not test the Lord your God.'” 8 Again,
the devil took him up to a very high hill and showed him all the kingdoms of the world
along with all their splendor. 9 He said to him, “All these things I will give you, if you
fall down and worship me.” 10 Then Jesus said to him, “Go away from here, Satan!
For it is written,
'You will worship the Lord your God, and you will serve only him.'”
11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
13 He left Nazareth and went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the Sea of Galilee,
in the territories of Zebulun and Naphtali. 14 This happened to fulfill what was said
by Isaiah the prophet,
15 “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles!
16 The people who sat in darkness
have seen a great light,
and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
upon them has a light arisen.”Matthew 4:17
1020
Matthew 5:19
17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven
has come near.” 18 As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers,
Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they
were fishermen. 19 Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers
of men.” 20 Immediately they left the nets and followed him. 21 As Jesus was going on
from there he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
They were in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets. He called them,
22 and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.
23 Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the
gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the
people. 24 The news about him went out into all of Syria, and the people brought to
him all those who were sick, ill with various diseases and pains, those possessed by
demons, and the epileptic and paralytic. Jesus healed them. 25 Large crowds followed
him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
5
1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain. When he had sat down,
his disciples came to him. 2 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek,
for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they will be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful,
for they will obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they will be called sons of God.
10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and say all kinds of
evil things against you falsely for my sake. 12 Rejoice and be very glad, for great is
your reward in heaven. For in this way people persecuted the prophets who lived
before you.
13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made
salty again? It is never again good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled
under people's feet. 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be
hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather on
the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. 16 Let your light shine before
people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in
heaven.
17 Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have come
not to destroy them, but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I say to you that until heaven
and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass away from the
law, until all things have been accomplished. 19 Therefore whoever breaks the least
one of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in theMatthew 5:20
1021
Matthew 5:48
kingdom of heaven. But whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great
in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will in no way enter the kingdom
of heaven.
21 You have heard that it was said to them in ancient times, 'Do not kill,' and,
'Whoever kills will be in danger of the judgment.' 22 But I say to you that everyone
who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever says
to his brother, 'You worthless person!' will be in danger of the council; and whoever
says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. 23 Therefore if you are offering
your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
24 leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go on your way. First be reconciled
with your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 25 Agree with your accuser
quickly while you are with him on the way to court, or your accuser may hand you
over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be
thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you, you will never come out from there until
you have paid the last bit of money you owe.
27 You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' 28 But I say to you that
everyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery
with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and
throw it away from you. For it is better for you that one of your body parts should
perish than that your whole body should be thrown into hell. 30 If your right hand
causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you
that one of your body parts should perish than that your whole body should go into
hell. 31 It was also said, 'Whoever sends his wife away, let him give her a certificate
of divorce.' 32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the
cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress. Whoever marries her after she
has been divorced commits adultery.
33 Again, you have heard that it was said to those in ancient times, 'Do not swear a
false oath, but carry out your oaths to the Lord.' 34 But I say to you, swear not at all,
neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool
for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Neither swear by
your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your speech be
'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no.' Anything that is more than this is from the evil one.
38 You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' 39 But
I say to you, do not resist one who is evil. Instead, whoever strikes you on your right
cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 If anyone wishes to go to court with you and
takes away your coat, let that person also have your cloak. 41 Whoever compels you
to go one mile, go with him two. 42 Give to anyone who asks you, and do not turn
away from anyone who wishes to borrow from you.
43 You have heard that it was said, 'You must love your neighbor and hate your
enemy.' 44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
* 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to
rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. 46 For if you
love those who love you, what reward do you get? Do not even the tax collectors do
the same thing? 47 If you greet only your brothers, what do you do more than others?
Do not even the Gentiles do the same thing? 48 Therefore you must be perfect, as
your heavenly Father is perfect.

1 Take heed that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people to be seen
by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. 2 So
when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself as the hypocrites do in
the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly
I say to you, they have received their reward. 3 But when you give alms, do not let
your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your gift may be given
in secret. Then your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
5 When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in
the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by people. Truly
I say to you, they have received their reward. 6 But you, when you pray, enter your
inner chamber. Shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your
Father who sees in secret will reward you. 7 When you pray, do not make useless
repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard because of their
many words. 8 Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what things
you need before you ask him. 9 Therefore pray like this:
'Our Father in heaven,
may your name be sanctified.
10 May your kingdom come.
May your will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us today our daily bread.
12 Forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13 Do not bring us into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.' *
14 For if you forgive people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive
you. 15 But if you do not forgive their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
your trespasses.
16 When you fast, do not have a mournful face as the hypocrites do, for they
disfigure their faces so that they may appear to people as fasting. Truly I say to
you, they have received their reward. 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head
and wash your face, 18 so that it would not appear to others that you are fasting, but
only to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret, will reward
you.
19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust
destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 Instead, store up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do
not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
22 The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body
is filled with light. 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness.
Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness!
24 No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other,
or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and
wealth. 25 Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or
what you will drink—or about your body, what you will wear. For is not life more
than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds in the air. They do
not sow or reap or gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you
not more valuable than they are? 27 Which one of you by being anxious can add one
* 6:13 The best ancient copies omit For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen .Matthew 6:28
1023
Matthew 7:27
cubit to his lifespan? 28 Why are you anxious about clothing? Think about the lilies
in the fields, how they grow. They do not work, and they do not spin cloth. 29 Yet I
say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. 30 If God
so clothes the grass in the fields, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into
the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not
be anxious and say, 'What will we eat?' or, 'What will we drink?' or, 'What clothes
will we wear?' 32 For the Gentiles search for these things, and your heavenly Father
knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and
all these things will be given to you. 34 Therefore, do not be anxious for tomorrow,
for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough evil of its own.
7
1 Do not judge, and you will not be judged. 2 For with the judgment you judge, you
will be judged, and with the measure that you measure, it will be measured out to
you. 3 Why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye, but
you do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother,
'Let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' while the log is in your own
eye? 5 You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see
clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother's eye. 6 Do not give what
is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls in front of the hogs. Otherwise they
may trample them underfoot, and then turn and tear you to pieces.
7 Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be
opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks, receives; everyone who seeks, finds; and
to the person who knocks, it will be opened. 9 Or which one of you, if his son asks
for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a
snake? 11 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
12 Therefore, whatever things you want people to do to you, you should also do to
them, for this is the law and the prophets.
13 Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that
leads to destruction, and there are many people who go through it. 14 But the gate is
narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life, and there are few who find it.
15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but are truly
ravenous wolves. 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes
from a thornbush or figs from thistles? 17 In the same way, every good tree produces
good fruit, but the bad tree produces bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot produce bad
fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not produce good
fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So then, you will recognize them by
their fruits. 21 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom
of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Many
people will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, in
your name drive out demons, and in your name do many mighty deeds?' 23 Then will
I openly declare to them, 'I never knew you! Get away from me, you evildoers!'
24 Therefore, everyone who hears my words and obeys them will be like a wise
man who built his house upon a rock. 25 The rain came down, the floods came, and
the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall down, for it was built on
the rock. 26 But everyone who hears my words and does not obey them will be like
a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. 27 The rain came down, the floods
came, and the winds blew and struck that house, and it fell, and its destruction was
complete.”Matthew 7:28
1024
Matthew 8:31
28 It came about that when Jesus finished speaking these words, the crowds were
astonished by his teaching, 29 for he taught them as one who had authority, and not
as their scribes.
8
1 When Jesus had come down from the hill, large crowds followed him. 2 Behold, a
leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can
make me clean.” 3 Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing.
Be clean.” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. 4 Jesus said to him, “See that
you say nothing to any man. Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest and
offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
5 When Jesus had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him and asked
him, 6 saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed and in terrible pain.”
7 Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” 8 The centurion answered and said,
“Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, only say the word and
my servant will be healed. 9 For I also am a man who is placed under authority, and
I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another one,
'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.” 10 When Jesus
heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, “Truly I say to
you, I have not found anyone with such faith in Israel. 11 I tell you, many will come
from the east and the west, and they will recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown
into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.” 13 Jesus
said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, so may it be done for you.” And
the servant was healed at that very hour.
14 When Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying sick
with a fever. 15 Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and
started serving him. 16 When evening had come, the people brought to Jesus many
who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all
who were sick. 17 In this way was fulfilled that which had been spoken by Isaiah the
prophet, saying, “He himself took our sickness and bore our diseases.”
18 Now when Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave instructions to leave for the
other side of the Sea of Galilee. 19 Then a scribe came to him and said, “Teacher, I will
follow you wherever you go.” 20 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and the birds
of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” 21 Another
of the disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” 22 But
Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
23 When Jesus had entered a boat, his disciples followed him into it. 24 Behold, there
arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But Jesus
was asleep. 25 The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord;
we are about to die!” 26 Jesus said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?”
Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. Then there was a great calm.
27 The men marveled and said, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and
the sea obey him?”
28 When Jesus had come to the other side and to the country of the Gadarenes, two
men who were possessed by demons met him. They were coming out of the tombs
and were very violent, so that no traveler could pass that way. 29 Behold, they cried
out and said, “What do we have to do with you, Son of God? Have you come here to
torment us before the set time?” 30 Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding, not
too far away from them. 31 The demons kept imploring Jesus and saying, “If you castMatthew 8:32
1025
Matthew 9:28
us out, send us away into that herd of pigs.” 32 Jesus said to them, “Go!” The demons
came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep
hill into the sea and they died in the water. 33 Those who had been tending the pigs
ran away and they went into the city and reported everything, especially what had
happened to the men who had been possessed by demons. 34 Behold, all the city came
out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
9
1 Jesus entered a boat, crossed over, and came into his own city.
2 Behold, they
brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the
paralyzed man, “Son, be of good cheer. Your sins have been forgiven.” 3 Behold, some
of the scribes said among themselves, “This man is blaspheming.” 4 Jesus knew their
thoughts and said, “Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? 5 For which is easier,
to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? 6 But that you may know
that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, ... “ he said to the paralytic,
“Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.” 7 Then the man got up and went
away to his house. 8 When the crowds saw this, they were amazed and praised God,
who had given such authority to people. 9 As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a
man named Matthew, who was sitting at the tax collection's tent. He said to him,
“Follow me.” He got up and followed him.
10 As Jesus sat down to eat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinful
people came and dined with Jesus and his disciples. 11 When the Pharisees saw it,
they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinful
people?” 12 When Jesus heard this, he said, “People who are strong in body do not
need a physician, only those who are sick. 13 You should go and learn what this means:
'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous to repent, but
sinners.”
14 Then the disciples of John came to him and said, “Why do we and the Pharisees
often fast, but your disciples do not fast?” 15 Jesus said to them, “Can wedding
attendants be sorrowful while the bridegroom is still with them? But the days will
come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
16 No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment, for the patch will tear away
from the garment, and a worse tear will be made. 17 Neither do people put new wine
into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will be spilled, and the
wineskins will be destroyed. Instead, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and
both will be preserved.”
18 While Jesus was saying these things to them, behold, an official came and bowed
down to him. He said, “My daughter has just now died, but come and lay your hand
on her, and she will live.” 19 Then Jesus got up and followed him, and so did his
disciples. 20 Behold, a woman who suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve
years came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his garment. 21 For she had said
to herself, “If only I touch his clothes, I will be made well.” 22 But Jesus turned and
saw her, and said, “Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well.” And the
woman was healed from that hour. 23 When Jesus came into the official's house, he
saw the flute players and the crowds making much noise. 24 He said, “Go away, for
the girl is not dead, but she is asleep.” But they laughed at him in mockery. 25 When
the crowd had been put outside, he entered the room and took her by the hand, and
the girl got up. 26 The news about this spread into all that region.
27 As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him. They kept shouting
and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 28 When Jesus had come into theMatthew 9:29
1026
Matthew 10:23
house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I can do
this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” 29 Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, “Let
it be done to you according to your faith,” 30 and their eyes were opened. Then Jesus
strictly commanded them and said, “See that no one knows about this.” 31 But the
two men went out and spread the news about this throughout that region.
32 As those two men were going away, behold, a mute man possessed by a demon
was brought to Jesus. 33 When the demon had been driven out, the mute man spoke.
The crowds were astonished and said, “This has never been seen before in Israel!”
34 But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of the demons, he drives out demons.”
35 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages. He continued teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease
and all kinds of sickness. 36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for
them, because they were troubled and discouraged. They were like sheep without a
shepherd. 37 He said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are
few. 38 Therefore urgently pray to the Lord of the harvest, so that he may send out
laborers into his harvest.”
10
1 Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority over unclean
spirits, to drive them out, and to heal all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness.
2 Now the names of the twelve apostles were these. The first, Simon (whom he also
called Peter), and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James son of
Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray
him.
5 These twelve Jesus sent out. He instructed them and said, “Do not go to any place
where Gentiles live, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans. 6 Go instead to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel; 7 and as you go, preach and say, 'The kingdom of
heaven has come near.' 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast
out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. 9 Do not carry any gold, silver, or
copper in your purses. 10 Do not take a traveling bag for your journey, or an extra
tunic, or sandals, or a staff, for a laborer deserves his food. 11 Whatever city or village
you enter, find who is worthy in it, and stay there until you leave. 12 As you enter
into the house, greet it. 13 If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if
it is not worthy, let your peace come back to you. 14 As for those who do not receive
you or listen to your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the
dust from your feet. 15 Truly I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
16 See, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be as wise as serpents
and harmless as doves. 17 Watch out for people! They will deliver you up to councils,
and they will whip you in their synagogues. 18 Then you will be brought before
governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 19 When
they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you will speak, for what to
say will be given to you in that hour. 20 For it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit
of your Father who will speak in you. 21 Brother will deliver up brother to death,
and a father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to
be put to death. 22 You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But whoever
endures to the end, that person will be saved. 23 When they persecute you in this
city, flee to the next, for truly I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities
of Israel before the Son of Man has come.Matthew 10:24
1027
Matthew 11:13
24 A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master. 25 It
is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher, and the servant like his
master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse would
be the names they call the members of his household! 26 Therefore do not fear them,
for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will
not be known. 27 What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you
hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops. 28 Do not be afraid of those who
kill the body but are unable to kill the soul. Instead, fear him who is able to destroy
both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one
of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But even the hairs
of your head are all numbered. 31 Do not fear. You are more valuable than many
sparrows. 32 Therefore everyone who confesses me before men, I will also confess
before my Father who is in heaven. 33 But he who denies me before men, I will also
deny before my Father who is in heaven.
34 Do not think that I came to bring peace upon the earth. I did not come to bring
peace, but a sword. 35 For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter
against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 36 A man's
enemies will be those of his own household. 37 He who loves father or mother more
than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not
worthy of me. 38 He who does not pick up his cross and follow after me is not worthy
of me. 39 He who finds his life will lose it. But he who loses his life for my sake will
find it.
40 He who welcomes you welcomes me, and he who welcomes me also welcomes
him who sent me. 41 He who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive
a prophet's reward, and he who welcomes a righteous man because he is a righteous
man will receive a righteous man's reward. 42 Whoever gives to one of these little
ones even a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, truly I say to you, he
will in no way lose his reward.”
11
1 It came about that when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he
departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. 2 Now when John heard in
the prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent a message by his disciples 3 and said
to him, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?” 4 Jesus
answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you see and hear. 5 Blind
people are receiving sight, lame people are walking, lepers are being cleansed, deaf
people are hearing again, people who have died are being raised back to life, and
needy people are being told the good news. 6 Blessed is anyone who is not offended
by me.”
7 As these men went on their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John,
“What did you go out in the desert to see—a reed being shaken by the wind? 8 But
what did you go out to see—a man dressed in soft clothing? Really, those who wear
soft clothing live in kings' houses. 9 But what did you go out to see—a prophet? Yes,
I say to you, and much more than a prophet. 10 This is he of whom it was written,
'See, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before
you.'
11 I say to you truly, among those born of women no one is greater than John the
Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
is. 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers
violence, and men of violence take it by force. 13 For all the prophets and the lawMatthew 11:14
1028
Matthew 12:14
have been prophesying until John; 14 and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah
who was to come. 15 He who has ears to hear, let him listen. 16 To what should I
compare this generation? It is like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and
call to one another 17 and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance.
We mourned, and you did not weep.' 18 For John came not eating bread or drinking
wine, and they say, 'He has a demon.' 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking
and they say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her deeds.”
20 Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty deeds were
done, because they had not repented. 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in
you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22 But it will be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. 23 You, Capernaum,
do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades.
For if in Sodom there had been done the mighty deeds that were done in you, it would
still have remained until today. 24 But I say to you that it shall be easier for the land
of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”
25 At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to
little children. 26 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight. 27 All things
have been entrusted to me from my Father; and no one knows the Son except the
Father and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son
chooses to reveal him. 28 Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened,
and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am meek
and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and
my burden is light.”
12
1 At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grainfields. His disciples
were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them. 2 But when the
Pharisees saw that, they said to Jesus, “See, your disciples do what is unlawful to
do on the Sabbath.” 3 But Jesus said to them, “Have you never read what David did,
when he was hungry, and the men who were with him? 4 He went into the house
of God and ate the bread of the presence, which was unlawful for him to eat and
unlawful for those who were with him, but lawful only for the priests. 5 Have you
not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath
but are guiltless? 6 But I say to you that one greater than the temple is here. 7 If you
had known what this meant, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have
condemned the guiltless. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
9 Then Jesus left from there and went into their synagogue. 10 Behold, there was
a man who had a withered hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, “Is it lawful
to heal on the Sabbath?” so that they might accuse him of sinning. 11 Jesus said to
them, “What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep, and if
this sheep fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath, would not grasp hold of it and lift it
out? 12 How much more valuable, then, is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful
to do good on the Sabbath.” 13 Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.”
He stretched it out, and it was restored to health, just like the other hand. 14 But the
Pharisees went out and plotted against him. They were seeking how they might put
him to death.Matthew 12:15
1029
Matthew 12:44
15 As Jesus perceived this, he withdrew from there. Many people followed him, and
he healed them all. 16 He commanded them not to make him known to others, 17 that
it might come true, what had been said through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
18 “See, my servant whom I have chosen;
my beloved one, in whom my soul is well pleased.
I will put my Spirit upon him,
and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
19 He will not strive nor cry aloud;
neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
20 He will not break any bruised reed;
he will not quench any smoking flax,
until he leads justice to victory, 21 and in his name the Gentiles will have certain
hope.”
22 Then someone blind and mute, possessed by a demon, was brought to Jesus. He
healed him, with the result that the mute man spoke and saw. 23 All the crowds were
amazed and said, “Can this man be the Son of David?” 24 But when the Pharisees
heard of this miracle, they said, “This man does not cast out demons except by
Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” 25 But Jesus knew their thoughts and said
to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or
house divided against itself will not stand. 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided
against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I drive out demons by
Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason they will be your
judges. 28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has
come upon you. 29 How can anyone enter the house of the strong man and steal his
belongings without tying up the strong man first? Then he will steal his belongings
from his house. 30 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does
not gather with me scatters. 31 Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be
forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32 Whoever
speaks any word against the Son of Man, that will be forgiven him. But whoever
speaks against the Holy Spirit, that will not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
nor in that which is to come. 33 Make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the
tree bad and its fruit bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. 34 You offspring of
vipers, since you are evil, how can you say good things? For out of the abundance
of the heart his mouth speaks. 35 The good man from the good treasure of his heart
produces what is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart produces
what is evil. 36 I say to you that in the day of judgment people will give an account
for every idle word they will have said. 37 For by your words you will be justified,
and by your words you will be condemned.”
38 Then certain scribes and Pharisees answered Jesus and said, “Teacher, we wish to
see a sign from you.” 39 But Jesus answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous
generation seeks for a sign. But no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah
the prophet. 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the
big fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth. 41 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of
people and will condemn it. For they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see,
someone greater than Jonah is here. 42 The Queen of the South will rise up at the
judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them. She came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, someone greater than
Solomon is here. 43 When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes
through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it. 44 Then it says, 'I willMatthew 12:45
1030
Matthew 13:21
return to my house from which I came.' Having returned, it finds that house swept
out and put in order. 45 Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more
evil than itself, and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that
man becomes worse than the first. It will be just like that with this evil generation.”
46 While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brothers
stood outside, seeking to speak to him. 47 Someone said to him, “Look, your mother
and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.” 48 But Jesus answered and
said to him who told him, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?” 49 Then
he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said, “See, here are my mother
and my brothers! 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that
person is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
13
1 On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. 2 A very large
crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it, while the whole
crowd stood on the beach. 3 Then Jesus said many things to them in parables. He
said, “Behold, a farmer went out to sow seed. 4 As he sowed, some seeds fell beside
the road, and the birds came and devoured them. 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground,
where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, because the soil
had no depth. 6 But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no
root, and they withered away. 7 Other seeds fell among the thorn plants. The thorn
plants grew up and choked them. 8 Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop,
some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. 9 He who has ears, let
him listen.”
10 The disciples came and said to Jesus, “Why do you talk to the crowd in
parables?” 11 Jesus answered and said to them, “You have been given the privilege of
understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 12 For
whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does
not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 13 This is why I talk to them
in parables: Though they are seeing, they do not see; and though they are hearing,
they do not hear, or understand. 14 To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that
which says,
'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand;
while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.
15 For this people's heart has become dull,
and they are hard of hearing,
and they have closed their eyes,
so they should not see with their eyes,
or hear with their ears,
or understand with their hearts,
so they would turn again,
and I would heal them.'
16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. 17 Truly I
say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you
see, and did not see them. They desired to hear the things that you hear, and did not
hear them. 18 Listen then to the parable of the farmer who sowed his seed. 19 When
anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes
and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown
beside the road. 20 What was sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word
and immediately receives it with joy, 21 yet he has no root in himself and he endures
for a while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he quicklyMatthew 13:22
1031
Matthew 13:50
falls away. 22 What was sown among the thorn plants, this is the person who hears
the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word,
and he becomes unfruitful. 23 What was sown on the good soil, this is the person who
hears the word and understands it. He bears fruit and makes a crop, some yielding
one hundred times as much as was planted, some sixty, and some thirty times as
much.”
24 Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, “The kingdom of heaven is
like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while people slept, his enemy
came and also sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away. 26 When the
blades sprouted and then produced their crop, then the weeds appeared also. 27 The
servants of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in
your field? How does it now have weeds?' 28 He said to them, 'An enemy has done
this.' The servants said to him, 'So do you want us to go and pull them out?' 29 The
landowner said, 'No. Because while you are pulling out the weeds, you might uproot
the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At the time of the
harvest I will say to the reapers, “First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to
burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.”'”
31 Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, “The kingdom of heaven
is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. 32 This seed is indeed
the smallest of all seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants.
It becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.” 33 Jesus
then told them another parable. “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman
took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen.”
34 All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and he said nothing to them
without a parable. 35 This was in order that what had been said through the prophet
might come true, when he said,
“I will open my mouth in parables.
I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world.”
36 Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him
and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” 37 Jesus answered and
said, “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. 38 The field is the world; and the
good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and
the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with
fire, so will it be at the end of the age. 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels,
and they will gather out of his kingdom all the things that cause sin and those who
commit iniquity. 42 They will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be
weeping and grinding of teeth. 43 Then will the righteous people shine like the sun
in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him listen.
44 The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it and
hid it. In his joy he goes, sells everything he possesses, and buys that field. 45 Again,
the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant looking for valuable pearls.
46 When he found one pearl of very great value, he went and sold everything that he
possessed and bought it.
47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and that
gathered creatures of every kind. 48 When it was filled, the fishermen drew it up on
the beach. Then they sat down and gathered the good things into containers, but the
worthless things they threw away. 49 It will be this way at the end of the age. The
angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous. 50 They willMatthew 13:51
1032
Matthew 14:26
throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of
teeth.
51 Have you understood all these things?” The disciples said to him, “Yes.” 52 Then
Jesus said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom
of heaven is like a man who is the owner of a house, who draws out old and new
things from his treasure.” 53 Then it came about that when Jesus had finished these
parables, he departed from that place.
54 Then Jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue. The
result was that they were astonished and said, “Where does this man get his wisdom
and these miracles from? 55 Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother
called Mary? Are not his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? 56 Are not all his
sisters with us? Where did he get all these things?” 57 They were offended by him.
But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and
in his own family.” 58 He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
14
1 About that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.
2 He said to
his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead. Therefore these
powers are at work in him.” 3 For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him
in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. 4 For John had said to him,
“It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife.” 5 Herod would have put him to
death, but he feared the people, because they regarded him as a prophet. 6 But when
Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased
Herod. 7 In response, he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
8 After being instructed by her mother, she said, “Give me here, on a platter, the head
of John the Baptist.” 9 The king was very upset by her request, but because of his oath
and because of all those at dinner with him, he ordered that it should be done. 10 He
sent and beheaded John in the prison. 11 Then his head was brought on a platter and
given to the girl and she took it to her mother. 12 Then his disciples came, took up the
corpse, and buried it. After this, they went and told Jesus.
13 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place.
When the crowds heard of it, they followed him on foot from the cities. 14 Then Jesus
came before them and saw the large crowd. He had compassion on them and healed
their sick. 15 When the evening had come, the disciples came to him and said, “This
is a deserted place, and the day is already over. Dismiss the crowds, so that they can
go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” 16 But Jesus said to them, “They
have no need to go away. You give them something to eat.” 17 They said to him, “We
have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.” 18 Jesus said, “Bring them to me.”
19 Then Jesus ordered the crowd to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and
the two fish. Looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them
to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd. 20 They all ate and were
filled. Then they took up what remained of the broken pieces of food—twelve baskets
full. 21 Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
22 Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the
other side, while he sent away the crowds. 23 After he had sent away the crowds,
he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there
alone. 24 But the boat was now a long way from land, being tossed about by the
waves, for the wind was blowing against them. 25 In the fourth watch of the night
Jesus approached them, walking on the sea. 26 When the disciples saw him walking
on the sea, they were terrified and said, “It is a ghost,” and they cried out in fear.Matthew 14:27
1033
Matthew 15:25
27 But Jesus spoke to them right away and said, “Be brave! It is I! Do not be afraid.”
28 Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on
the water.” 29 Jesus said, “Come.” So Peter got out from the boat and walked on the
water to go to Jesus. 30 But when Peter saw the wind, he became afraid. As he began
to sink, he cried out and said, “Lord, save me!” 31 Jesus immediately stretched out
his hand, took hold of Peter, and said to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”
32 Then when Jesus and Peter went into the boat, the wind ceased blowing. 33 Then
the disciples in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
34 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 35 When the men
in that place recognized Jesus, they sent messages everywhere into the surrounding
area, and they brought to him everyone who was sick. 36 They begged him that they
might just touch the edge of his garment, and as many as touched it were healed.
15
1 Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They said, 2 “Why
do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For they do not wash their
hands when they eat.” 3 He answered and said to them, “Then why do you violate
the commandment of God for the sake of your traditions? 4 For God said, 'Honor your
father and your mother,' and 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother, will surely
die.' 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother “Whatever help you would
have received from me is now a gift given to God,”' 6 that person does not need to
honor his father. In this way you have made void the word of God * for the sake of
your traditions. 7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you when he said,
8 'This people honors me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me.
9 They worship me in vain,
because they teach as their doctrines the commandments of people.'”
10 Then he called the crowd to himself and said to them, “Listen and understand—
11 Nothing that enters into the mouth defiles a person. Instead, what comes out of the
mouth, this is what defiles a person.” 12 Then the disciples came and said to Jesus,
“Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?”
13 Jesus answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted
will be rooted up. 14 Let them alone, they are blind guides. If a blind person guides
another blind person, both will fall into a pit.” 15 Peter responded and said to Jesus,
“Explain this parable to us.” 16 Jesus said, “Are you also still without understanding?
17 Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is
then passed out into the latrine? 18 But the things that come out of the mouth come
from the heart. They are the things that defile a person. 19 For from the heart proceed
evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, and slander.
20 These are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not
defile a person.”
21 Then Jesus went away from there and withdrew toward the regions of the cities
of Tyre and Sidon. 22 Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from that region. She
shouted out and said, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is
severely demon-possessed.” 23 But Jesus answered her not a word. His disciples
came and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she is shouting after us.” 24 But
Jesus answered and said, “I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.” 25 But she came and bowed down before him, saying, “Lord, help
* 15:6 The best ancient copies have the word of God some other ancient copies have the commandment. It is
difficult to choose the better reading.Matthew 15:26
1034
Matthew 16:18
me.” 26 He answered and said, “It is not right to take the children's bread and throw
it to the little dogs.” 27 She said, “Yes, Lord, but even the little dogs eat some of the
crumbs that fall from their masters' tables.” 28 Then Jesus answered and said to her,
“Woman, great is your faith; let it be done for you just as you wish.” At that hour her
daughter was healed.
29 Jesus left that place and went near to the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a hill
and sat there. 30 Large crowds came to him. They brought with them lame, blind,
mute, and crippled people, and many others who were sick. They presented them at
Jesus' feet, and he healed them. 31 So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute
persons speak, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. They
praised the God of Israel.
32 Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion on the crowd,
because they have stayed with me for three days already and have nothing to eat. I
do not want to send them away without eating, or they may faint on the way.” 33 The
disciples said to him, “Where can we get enough loaves of bread in such a deserted
place to satisfy so large a crowd?” 34 Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you
have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” 35 Then Jesus commanded the crowd
to sit down on the ground. 36 He took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving
thanks, he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples. The disciples gave them
to the crowd. 37 The people all ate and were satisfied. Then they gathered up seven
baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. 38 Those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and children. 39 Then Jesus sent the crowds away and
got into the boat and went into the region of Magadan.
16
1 The Pharisees and Sadducees came and tested him by asking him to show them a
sign from the sky. 2 But he answered and said to them, “When it is evening, you say,
'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.' 3 When it is morning, you say, 'It will be foul
weather, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance
of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. 4 An evil and adulterous
generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.”
Then Jesus left them and went away.
5 When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. 6 Jesus
said to them, “Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
7 The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, “It is because we took no bread.”
8 Jesus was aware of this and said, “You of little faith, why do you reason among
yourselves and say that it is because you have taken no bread? 9 Do you not yet
perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets
you gathered up? 10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets
you took up? 11 How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you
about bread? Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
12 Then they understood that he was not telling them to beware of yeast in bread, but
to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
13 Now when Jesus came to the regions near Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, saying, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” 14 They said, “Some say
John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” 15 He
said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 16 Answering, Simon Peter said, “You
are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 17 Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed
are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my
Father who is in heaven. 18 I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock IMatthew 16:19
1035
Matthew 17:20
will build my church. The gates of Hades will not prevail against it. 19 I will give to
you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”
20 Then Jesus commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was the
Christ.
21 From that time Jesus started to tell his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem,
suffer many things at the hand of the elders and chief priests and scribes, be killed,
and be raised back to life on the third day. 22 Then Peter took him aside and rebuked
him, saying, “May this be far from you, Lord; may this never happen to you.” 23 But
Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to
me, for you do not care for the things of God, but for the things of people.” 24 Then
Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take
up his cross, and follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and
whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. 26 For what does it profit a person if he
gains the whole world but forfeits his life? What can a person give in exchange for
his life? 27 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels.
Then he will reward every person according to what he has done. 28 Truly I say to
you, there are some of you standing here who will not taste death until they see the
Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
17
1 Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought
them up a high mountain by themselves. 2 He was transfigured before them. His
face shone like the sun, and his garments became as brilliant as the light. 3 Behold,
there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him. 4 Peter answered and
said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you desire, I will make here three
shelters—one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 5 While he was still
speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, there was a voice
out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen
to him.” 6 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their face and were very afraid.
7 Then Jesus came and touched them and said, “Get up and do not be afraid.” 8 Then
they looked up but saw no one except Jesus only.
9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Report
this vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” 10 His disciples
asked him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 11 Jesus
answered and said, “Elijah will indeed come and restore all things. 12 But I tell you,
Elijah has already come, but they did not recognize him. Instead, they did whatever
they wanted to him. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands.”
13 Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
14 When they had come to the crowd, a man came to him, knelt before him, and
said, 15 “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers severely. For he
often falls into the fire or the water. 16 I brought him to your disciples, but they could
not cure him.” 17 Jesus answered and said, “Unbelieving and corrupt generation, how
long will I have to stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring him here
to me.” 18 Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed
from that hour.
19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it
out?” 20 Jesus said to them, “Because of your small faith. For I truly say to you, if you
have faith even as small as a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain,Matthew 17:21
1036
Matthew 18:19
'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
21 *
22 While they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to his disciples, “The Son of Man will be
delivered into the hands of people, 23 and they will kill him, and the third day he will
be raised up.” The disciples became very upset.
24 When they had come to Capernaum, the men who collected the half-shekel tax
came to Peter and said, “Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel tax?” 25 He said,
“Yes.” When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first and said, “What do
you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes? From
their sons or from others?” 26 When he said, “From others,” Jesus said to him, “Then
the sons are free.” 27 But so that we do not cause the tax collectors to sin, go to the
sea, throw in a hook, and draw in the fish that comes up first. When you have opened
its mouth, you will find a shekel. Take it and give it to the tax collectors for me and
you.”
18
1 In that same time the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Who is greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?” 2 Jesus called to himself a little child, set him among them,
3 and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you
will in no way enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself
like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 Whoever welcomes
a little child like this in my name receives me. 6 But whoever causes one of these
little ones who believes in me to sin, it would be better for him that a great millstone
should be hung about his neck, and that he should be sunk into the depths of the sea.
7 Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that those
stumbling blocks come, but woe to the person through whom those stumbling blocks
come! 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away
from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown into
the eternal fire having two hands or two feet. 9 If your eye causes you to stumble,
pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one
eye than to be thrown into the eternal fire having both eyes. 10 See that you do not
despise any of these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always
look on the face of my Father who is in heaven. 11 * 12 What do you think? If anyone
has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine
on the hillside and go off seeking the one that went astray? 13 If he finds it, truly I
say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
14 In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little
ones should perish.
15 If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him
alone. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother. 16 But if he does not
listen to you, take one or two others along with you, so that by the mouth of two or
three witnesses every word might be verified. 17 And if he refuses to listen to them,
tell the matter to the church. If he also refuses to listen to the church, let him be to
you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 18 Truly I say to you, whatever things you bind on
earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will be released in
heaven. 19 Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask,

it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. 20 For where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”
21 Then Peter came and said to Jesus, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against
me and I forgive him? Until seven times?” 22 Jesus said to him, “I do not tell you seven
times, but until seventy times seven. 23 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is similar
to a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24 As he began the
settling, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. 25 But
since he had not the means to repay, his master commanded him to be sold, together
with his wife and children and everything that he had, and payment to be made.
26 So the servant fell down, bowed down before him, and said, 'Master, have patience
with me, and I will pay you everything.' 27 So the master of that servant, since he was
moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. 28 But that servant
went out and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii.
He grasped him, took him by the throat, and said, 'Pay me what you owe.' 29 But his
fellow servant fell down and implored him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I
will repay you.' 30 But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw him into
prison until he should pay him what he owed. 31 When his fellow servants saw what
had happened, they were very upset. They came and told their master everything
that had happened. 32 Then that servant's master called him, and said to him, 'You
wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you implored me. 33 Should you
not have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?' 34 His
master was angry and handed him over to the torturers until he would pay all that
was owed. 35 So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not forgive your
brother from your heart.”
19
1 It came about that when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee,
and came to the region of Judea that is beyond the Jordan River. 2 Great crowds
followed him, and he healed them there.
3 Pharisees came to him, testing him, saying to him, “Is it lawful for a man to
divorce his wife for any cause?” 4 Jesus answered and said, “Have you not read that
he who made them from the beginning made them male and female? 5 He who made
them also said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and join to
his wife, and the two will become one flesh.' 6 So they are no longer two, but one
flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one tear apart.” 7 They said
to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of divorce and then
to send her away?” 8 He said to them, “For your hardness of heart, Moses allowed
you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way. 9 I say to
you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another,
commits adultery; and the man who marries a woman who is divorced commits
adultery.” 10 The disciples said to Jesus, “If that is the case of a man with his wife,
it is not good to marry.” 11 But Jesus said to them, “Not everyone can accept this
teaching, but only those who are allowed to accept it. 12 For there are eunuchs who
were that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made
eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake
of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this teaching, let him receive it.”
13 Then some little children were brought to him so that he would lay his hands on
them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus said, “Permit the little
children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongsMatthew 19:15
1038
Matthew 20:16
to such ones.” 15 He placed his hands on the children, and then he went away from
there.
16 Behold, a man came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do that
I may have eternal life?” 17 Jesus said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is
good? Only one is good, but if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”
18 The man said to him, “Which commandments?” Jesus said, “Do not kill, do not
commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, 19 honor your father and
your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.” 20 The young man said to him, “All
these things I have obeyed. What do I still need?” 21 Jesus said to him, “If you wish
to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22 But when the young man heard what Jesus said,
he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
23 Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” 25 When
the disciples heard it, they were very astonished and said, “Who then can be saved?”
26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With people this is impossible, but with God all
things are possible.” 27 Then Peter answered and said to him, “See, we have left
everything and followed you. What then will we have?” 28 Jesus said to them, “Truly
I say to you, in the new age when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you
who have followed me will also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel. 29 Every one who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or
land for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times as much and will inherit
eternal life. 30 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
20
1 For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning
to hire workers for his vineyard. 2 After he had agreed with the workers for one
denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 He went out again about the third
hour and saw other workers standing idle in the marketplace. 4 To them he said,
'You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went
to work. 5 Again he went out about the sixth hour and again the ninth hour, and
did the same. 6 Once more about the eleventh hour he went out and found others
standing idle. He said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all the day long?' 7 They
said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the
vineyard.' 8 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call
the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.' 9 When
the workers who had been hired at the eleventh hour came, each of them received
a denarius. 10 When the first workers came, they thought that they would receive
more, but they also received one denarius each. 11 When they received their wages,
they complained about the landowner. 12 They said, 'These last workers have spent
only one hour in work, but you have made them equal to us, we who have borne the
burden of the day and the scorching heat.' 13 But the owner answered and said to one
of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for one denarius?
14 Take what belongs to you and go your way. I choose to give to these last hired
workers just the same as to you. 15 Do I not have the right to do as I want with what
belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?' 16 So the last will be first,
and the first last.” *
* 20:16 The best ancient copies omit Many are called, but few are chosen .Matthew 20:17

Matthew 21:9
17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside, and on the way
he said to them, 18 “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be
delivered to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death 19 and will
deliver him to the Gentiles for them to mock, to flog, and to crucify him. But on the
third day he will be raised up.”
20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed
down before him and asked for something from him. 21 Jesus said to her, “What do
you wish?” She said to him, “Command that these my two sons may sit, one at your
right hand and one at your left hand, in your kingdom.” 22 But Jesus answered and
said, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am
about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” 23 He said to them, “My cup you
will indeed drink. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give,
but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” 24 When the other
ten disciples heard this, they were very angry with the two brothers. 25 But Jesus
called them to himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles subjugate
them, and their important men exercise authority over them. 26 But it must not be
this way among you. Instead, whoever wishes to become great among you must be
your servant, 27 and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant,
28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life
as a ransom for many.”
29 As they went out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him. 30 There were two
blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they
shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.” 31 The crowd rebuked them, telling
them to be quiet, but they cried out even more loudly, “Lord, Son of David, have
mercy on us.” 32 Then Jesus stood still and called to them and said, “What do you
wish me to do for you?” 33 They said to him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”
34 Then Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes. Immediately they
received their sight and followed him.
21
1 As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the
Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, “Go into the next
village, and you will immediately find a donkey tied up there, and a colt with her.
Untie them and bring them to me. 3 If anyone says anything to you about that, you
will say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and that person will immediately send them
with you.” 4 Now this came about that what was spoken through the prophet might
be fulfilled. He said,
5 “Tell the daughter of Zion,
'See, your King is coming to you,
Humble and riding on a donkey—
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'”
6 Then the disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them. 7 They brought
the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat upon the cloaks.
8 Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from
the trees and spread them in the road. 9 Then the crowds that went before Jesus and
those that followed him were shouting,
“Hosanna to the son of David!
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
Hosanna in the highest!”Matthew 21:10
1040
Matthew 21:40
10 When Jesus had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred and said, “Who is
this?” 11 The crowds answered, “This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
12 Then Jesus entered the temple.
He cast out all those who bought and sold in
the temple, and turned over the tables of the money changers and the seats of those
who sold doves. 13 He said to them, “It is written, 'My house will be called a house of
prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers.” 14 Then the blind and the lame came to
him in the temple, and he healed them. 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes
saw the marvelous things that he did, and when they heard the children shouting
in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became very angry.
16 They said to him, “Do you hear what they are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes!
But have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of little children and nursing infants you
have prepared praise'?” 17 Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany
and spent the night there.
18 Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he was hungry. 19 Seeing a fig
tree along the roadside, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves. He
said to it, “May there be no fruit from you ever again,” and immediately the fig tree
withered. 20 When the disciples saw it, they marveled and said, “How did the fig tree
immediately wither away?” 21 Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you,
if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to this fig
tree, but you will even say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,'
and it will be done. 22 Whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
23 When Jesus had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the
people came to him as he was teaching and said, “By what authority do you do these
things, and who gave you this authority?” 24 Jesus answered and said to them, “I
also will ask you one question. If you tell me, I will tell you by what authority I do
these things. 25 The baptism of John—from where did it come? From heaven or from
men?” They discussed among themselves, saying, “If we say, 'From heaven,' he will
say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 26 But if we say, 'From men,' we fear
the crowd, because they all view John as a prophet.” 27 Then they answered Jesus
and said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what
authority I do these things. 28 But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went
to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.' 29 The son answered and
said, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went. 30 Then the man went
to the second son and said the same thing. He answered and said, 'I will go, sir,' but
he did not go. 31 Which of the two sons did his father's will?” They said, “The first
one.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes
will enter the kingdom of God before you do. 32 For John came to you in the way of
righteousness, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes
believed him. But you, even when you saw this, you did not repent afterward and
believe him.
33 Listen to another parable. There was a man, a landowner. He planted a vineyard,
set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a watchtower, and rented it out to vine
growers. Then he went into another country. 34 When the time of the fruit harvest
approached, he sent some servants to the vine growers to get his fruit. 35 But the vine
growers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned still another. 36 Again,
the owner sent other servants, more than the first, but the vine growers treated them
in the same way. 37 After that, the owner sent his own son to them, saying, 'They
will respect my son.' 38 But when the vine growers saw the son, they said among
themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take over the inheritance.'
39 So they took him, threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40 Now when theMatthew 21:41
1041
Matthew 22:25
owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine growers?” 41 They said to
him, “He will destroy those miserable men in the most severe way, and will then rent
out the vineyard to other vine growers, men who will give him his share of crops at
the harvest time.” 42 Jesus said to them, “Did you never read in the scriptures,
'The stone which the builders rejected
has been made the cornerstone.
This was from the Lord,
and it is marvelous in our eyes'?
43 Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will
be given to a nation that produces its fruits. 44 Whoever falls on this stone will be
broken to pieces. But anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.” 45 When the chief
priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they understood he was speaking about
them. 46 Seeking to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowd, because the people
regarded him as a prophet.
22
1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 2 “The kingdom of heaven is like
a certain king who prepared a marriage feast for his son. 3 He sent out his servants
to call those who had been invited to come to the marriage feast, but they would
not come. 4 Again the king sent other servants, saying, 'Tell them who are invited,
“See, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been killed, and
all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast.”' 5 But they paid no attention and
went away, one to his farm, another to his business. 6 The others seized the king's
servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 7 The king was angry, and he sent
his soldiers and they killed those murderers and burned their city. 8 Then he said to
his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
9 Therefore go to the highway crossings and invite as many people to the marriage
feast as you can find.' 10 The servants went out to the highways and gathered together
all the people they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with
guests. 11 But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw a man there who
was not wearing wedding clothes. 12 The king said to him, 'Friend, how did you come
in here without wedding clothes?' But the man was speechless. 13 Then the king said
to the servants, 'Bind this man hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness,
where there will be weeping and the grinding of teeth.' 14 For many people are called,
but few are chosen.”
15 Then the Pharisees went and planned how they might entrap Jesus in his own
talk. 16 Then they sent to him their disciples, together with the Herodians. They said
to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and that you teach God's way in
truth. You care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people.
17 So tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” 18 But
Jesus understood their wickedness and said, “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
19 Show me the coin for the tax.” Then they brought a denarius to him. 20 Jesus said
to them, “Whose image and name are these?” 21 They said to him, “Caesar's.” Then
Jesus said to them, “Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the
things that are God's.” 22 When they heard it, they marveled. Then they left him and
went away.
23 On that day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him.
They asked him, 24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children,
his brother must marry his wife and have children for his brother.' 25 There were
seven brothers. The first married and then died. Having left no children, he left hisMatthew 22:26
1042
Matthew 23:15
wife to his brother. 26 Then the second brother did the same thing, then the third,
all the way to the seventh brother. 27 After them all, the woman died. 28 Now in the
resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven brothers? For they all had married
her.” 29 But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do
not know the scriptures or the power of God. 30 For in the resurrection they neither
marry nor are given in marriage. Instead, they are like angels in heaven. 31 But
concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you
by God, saying, 32 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.” 33 When the crowds heard this,
they were astonished at his teaching.
34 But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they
gathered themselves together. 35 One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing
him— 36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” 37 Jesus said to
him, “'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
mind.' 38 This is the great and first commandment. 39 And a second commandment
is like it—'Love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 On these two commandments depend
the whole law and the prophets.”
41 Now while the Pharisees were still gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
42 He said, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him,
“The son of David.” 43 Jesus said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call him
Lord, saying,
44 'The Lord said to my Lord,
“Sit at my right hand,
until I make your enemies your footstool”'?
45 If David then calls the Christ 'Lord,' how is he David's son?” 46 No one was able to
answer him a word, and no man dared ask him any more questions from that day
on.
23
1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples. 2 He said, “The scribes and
the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. 3 Therefore whatever they command you to do, do
these things and observe them. But do not imitate their deeds, for they say things
but then do not do them. 4 Yes, they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry,
and then they put them on people's shoulders. But they themselves will not move a
finger to carry them. 5 They do all their deeds to be seen by people. For they make
their phylacteries wide, and they enlarge the edges of their garments. 6 They love the
chief places at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues, 7 and special greetings
in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi' by people. 8 But you must not be called
'Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, and all you are brothers. 9 And call no man on
earth your father, for you have only one Father, and he is in heaven. 10 Neither must
you be called 'teacher,' for you have only one teacher, the Christ. 11 But he who is
greatest among you will be your servant. 12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of
heaven against people. For you do not enter it yourselves, and neither do you allow
those about to enter to do so. 14 * 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
* 23:14 The best ancient copies omit verse 14 (some copies add the verse after verse 12). Woe to you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will
therefore receive greater condemnation .Matthew 23:16
1043
Matthew 24:5
For you go over sea and land to make one convert, and when he has become one,
you make him twice as much a son of hell as you.
16 Woe to you, you blind guides, you who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it
is nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound to his oath.'
17 You blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?
18 And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing. But whoever swears by the gift
that is on it, he is bound to his oath.' 19 You blind people! Which is greater, the gift or
the altar that makes the gift holy? 20 Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by
it and by everything on it. 21 The one who swears by the temple swears by it and by
the one who lives in it. 22 And the one who swears by heaven swears by the throne
of God and by him who sits on it.
23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and
cumin, but you have left undone the weightier matters of the law—justice and mercy
and faith. But these you ought to have done and not to have left the other undone.
24 You blind guides, you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the
cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26 You blind
Pharisee! Clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may
become clean also.
27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed
tombs, which on the outside look beautiful, but on the inside are full of dead men's
bones and everything unclean. 28 In the same way, you also outwardly appear
righteous to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the
prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous. 30 You say, 'If we had lived in the
days of our fathers, we would not have been participants with them in shedding the
blood of the prophets.' 31 Therefore you testify against yourselves that you are sons
of those who killed the prophets. 32 You also fill up the measure of your fathers.
33 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of hell?
34 Therefore, see, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them
you will kill and crucify, and some you will whip in your synagogues and drive them
out from city to city. 35 The result is that upon you will come all the righteous blood
that has been shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of
Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
36 Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to
you! How often did I long to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her
chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! 38 See, your house is left to you
desolate. 39 For I say to you, You will not see me from now on until you say, 'Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'”
24
1 Jesus went out from the temple and was going on his way. His disciples came to
him to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2 But he answered and said to
them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone will be left
on another that will not be torn down.”
3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said,
“Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be the sign of your coming and
of the end of the age?” 4 Jesus answered and said to them, “Be careful that no one
leads you astray. 5 For many will come in my name. They will say, 'I am the Christ,'Matthew 24:6
1044
Matthew 24:43
and will lead many astray. 6 You will hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you
are not troubled, for these things must happen; but the end is not yet. 7 For nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and
earthquakes in various places. 8 But all these things are only the beginning of birth
pains. 9 Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you. You will be hated
by all the nations for my name's sake. 10 Then many will stumble, and betray one
another and hate one another. 11 Many false prophets will rise up and lead many
astray. 12 Because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But
the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 This gospel of the kingdom will
be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations. Then the end will
come.
15 Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (let the reader understand), 16 “let
those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, 17 let him who is on the housetop not
go down to take anything out of his house, 18 and let him who is in the field not
return to take his cloak. 19 But woe to those who are with child and to those who are
nursing infants in those days! 20 Pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or
on a Sabbath. 21 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the
beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again. 22 Unless those days are
shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be
shortened. 23 Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There is the
Christ!' do not believe it. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will come and show
great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have
told you ahead of time. 26 Therefore, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,'
do not go out to the wilderness. Or, 'See, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
27 For as the lightning shines out from the east and flashes all the way to the west,
so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever a dead animal is, there the
vultures will gather.
29 But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, the
moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the
heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky,
and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on
the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. 31 He will send his angels with a
great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds,
from one end of the sky to the other.
32 Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as the branch becomes tender and puts
out its leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So also, when you see all these things,
you should know that he is near, at the very gates. 34 Truly I say to you, this generation
will not pass away until all of these things will have happened. 35 Heaven and the
earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 36 But concerning that day
and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the
Father. 37 As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as
in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and they knew nothing until the
flood came and took them all away—so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Then
two men will be in a field—one will be taken, and one will be left. 41 Two women
will be grinding with a mill—one will be taken, and one will be left. 42 Therefore be
on your guard, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 43 But know
this, that if the master of the house had known in what time of night the thief was
coming, he would have been on guard and would not have allowed his house to beMatthew 24:44
1045
Matthew 25:28
broken into. 44 Therefore you must also be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an
hour that you do not expect.
45 So who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his
household in order to give them their food at the right time? 46 Blessed is that servant
whom his master will find doing that when he comes. 47 Truly I say to you that the
master will set him over everything that he owns. 48 But if an evil servant says in his
heart, 'My master has been delayed,' 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and
eats and drinks with drunkards, 50 then the master of that servant will come on a day
that the servant does not expect and at an hour that he does not know. 51 His master
will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will
be weeping and grinding of teeth.
25
1 Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went
to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 3 For when
the foolish virgins took their lamps, they did not take any oil with them. 4 But the wise
virgins took containers of oil along with their lamps. 5 Now while the bridegroom
was delayed, they all got sleepy and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a cry, 'Look,
the bridegroom! Go out and meet him.' 7 Then all those virgins rose up and trimmed
their lamps. 8 The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil because our lamps
are going out.' 9 But the wise answered and said, 'Since there will not be enough for
us and you, go instead to those who sell and buy some for yourselves.' 10 While they
went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him to
the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 11 Afterward the other virgins also came
and said, 'Master, master, open for us.' 12 But he answered and said, 'Truly I say to
you, I do not know you.' 13 Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.
14 For it is like when a man was about to go into another country. He called his own
servants and gave over to them his wealth. 15 To one of them he gave five talents, to
another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talent. Each one received an
amount according to his own ability, and that man went on his journey. 16 The one
who received the five talents went at once and invested them and made another five
talents. 17 Likewise the one who had received two talents made another two. 18 But
the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid
his master's money. 19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came back
and settled accounts with them. 20 The servant who had received the five talents
came and brought another five talents. He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents.
See, I have made five talents more.' 21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and
faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge
over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.' 22 The servant who had received
two talents came and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two
more talents.' 23 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You
have been faithful over a few things. I will put you in charge over many things.
Enter into the joy of your master.' 24 Then the servant who had received one talent
came and said, 'Master, I know that you are a strict man. You reap where you did
not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter. 25 I was afraid, so I went away
and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.' 26 But
his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that
I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered. 27 Therefore
you should have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I would have
received back my own with interest. 28 Therefore take away the talent from him andMatthew 25:29
1046
Matthew 26:16
give it to the servant who has ten talents. 29 For to everyone who possesses, more will
be given—even more abundantly. But from anyone who does not possess anything,
even what he does have will be taken away. 30 Throw the worthless servant into the
outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'
31 When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will
sit on his glorious throne. 32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will
separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats. 33 He will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. 34 Then
the King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you who have been blessed by
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
35 For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me a drink;
I was a stranger and you took me in; 36 I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick
and you cared for me; I was in prison and you came to me.' 37 Then the righteous
will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty
and give you a drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and take you in? Or naked
and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?' 40 Then
the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, what you did for one of the
least of these brothers of mine, you did it for me.' 41 Then he will say to those on his
left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared
for the devil and his angels, 42 because I was hungry, but you did not give me food; I
was thirsty, but you did not give me a drink; 43 I was a stranger, but you did not take
me in; naked, but you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but you did not care for
me.' 44 Then they will also answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or
thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not serve you?' 45 Then
he will answer them and say, 'Truly I say to you, what you did not do for one of the
least of these, you did not do for me.' 46 These will go away into eternal punishment,
but the righteous into eternal life.”
26
1 It came about that when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
2 “You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be crucified.” 3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people
were gathered together in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.
4 They plotted together to arrest Jesus stealthily and kill him. 5 For they were saying,
“Not during the feast, so that a riot does not arise among the people.”
6 Now while Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7 as he was
reclining at table, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive
ointment, and she poured it upon his head. 8 But when his disciples saw it, they
became angry and said, “What is the reason for this waste? 9 This could have been
sold for a large amount and given to the poor.” 10 But Jesus, knowing this, said to
them, “Why are you troubling this woman? For she has done a beautiful thing for
me. 11 You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. 12 For
when she poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. 13 Truly I say
to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has
done will also be spoken of in memory of her.”
14 Then one of the twelve, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
15 and said, “What are you willing to give me to deliver him to you?” They weighed
out thirty pieces of silver for him. 16 From that moment he sought an opportunity to
deliver him to them.Matthew 26:17
1047
Matthew 26:51
17 Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus and said,
“Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?” 18 He said, “Go
into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, “My time is at hand.
I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”'” 19 The disciples did as
Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
20 When evening came, he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples. 21 As they
were eating, he said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.” 22 They were
very sorrowful, and each one began to ask him, “Surely not I, Lord?” 23 He answered,
“The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me. 24 The
Son of Man will go, just as it is written about him. But woe to that man by whom the
Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”
25 Judas, who would betray him said, “Is it I, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said
it yourself.”
26 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, and broke it. He gave it to the
disciples and said, “Take, eat. This is my body.” 27 He took a cup and gave thanks, and
gave it to them and said, “Drink it, all of you. 28 For this is my blood of the covenant
that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29 But I say to you, I will not
drink again of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in
my Father's kingdom.”
30 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 31 Then Jesus
said to them, “All of you will fall away tonight because of me, for it is written,
'I will strike the shepherd
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
32 But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
33 But Peter said to him, “Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.”
34 Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you
will deny me three times.” 35 Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will
not deny you.” All the other disciples said the same thing.
36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to his disciples,
“Sit here while I go over there and pray.” 37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee
with him and began to become sorrowful and troubled. 38 Then he said to them, “My
soul is deeply sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me.” 39 He went
a little farther, fell on his face, and prayed. He said, “My Father, if it is possible, let
this cup pass from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.” 40 He came to the disciples
and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “What, could you not watch with me
for one hour? 41 Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 42 He went away a second time and prayed.
He said, “My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.”
43 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 44 So leaving
them again, he went away and prayed a third time, saying the same words. 45 Then
Jesus came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your
rest? Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands
of sinners. 46 Arise, let us go. Look, the one who is betraying me is near.”
47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came. A large crowd came
with him from the chief priests and elders of the people. They came with swords
and clubs. 48 Now the man who was going to betray Jesus had given them a signal,
saying, “Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” 49 Immediately he came up to
Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and he kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, “Friend,
do what you have come to do.” Then they came, laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
51 Behold, one of those who was with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword,Matthew 26:52
1048
Matthew 27:9
and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him,
“Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by
the sword. 53 Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send
me more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then would the scriptures be
fulfilled, that this must happen?” 55 At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you
come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber? Every day I sat teaching
in the temple, and you did not arrest me. 56 But all this has happened so that the
writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.
57 Those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where
the scribes and the elders had gathered together. 58 But Peter followed him from
a distance to the courtyard of the high priest. He went inside and sat down with
the guards to see the outcome. 59 Now the chief priests and the whole council were
looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death. 60 They
did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later two
came forward 61 and said, “This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God
and rebuild it in three days.'” 62 The high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you
have no answer? What is it that they are testifying against you?” 63 But Jesus was
silent. The high priest said to him, “I command you by the living God, tell us whether
you are the Christ, the Son of God.” 64 Jesus replied to him, “You have said it yourself.
But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of
Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.” 65 Then the high priest tore his clothes
and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, now
you have heard the blasphemy. 66 What do you think?” They answered and said,
“He is worthy of death.” 67 Then they spit in his face and beat him, and struck him
with the palms of their hands, 68 and said, “Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is it that
struck you?”
69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him
and said, “You were also with Jesus of Galilee.” 70 But he denied it in front of them
all, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.” 71 When he went out to the
gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those there, “This man was also
with Jesus of Nazareth.” 72 He again denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”
73 After a little while those who were standing by came and said to Peter, “Surely
you are also one of them, for the way you speak gives you away.” 74 Then he began
to curse and swear, “I do not know the man,” and immediately a rooster crowed.
75 Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows you
will deny me three times.” Then he went outside and wept bitterly.
27
1 Now when morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted
against Jesus to put him to death. 2 They bound him, led him away, and delivered
him to Pilate the governor.
3 Then when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned,
he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
4 and said, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that
to us? See to that yourself.” 5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple,
and departed, and went out and hanged himself. 6 The chief priests took the pieces of
silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, because it is the price of
blood.” 7 They discussed the matter together and with the money bought the potter's
field in which to bury strangers. 8 For this reason that field has been called, “The Field
of Blood” to this day. 9 Then that which had been spoken by Jeremiah the prophetMatthew 27:10
1049
Matthew 27:47
was fulfilled, saying, “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by
the people of Israel, 10 and they gave it for the potter's field, as the Lord had directed
me.”
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the
King of the Jews?” Jesus answered him, “You say so.” 12 But when he was accused
by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 13 Then Pilate said to him, “Do
you not hear all the charges against you?” 14 But he did not answer even one word,
so that the governor was greatly amazed. 15 Now at the feast it was the custom of
the governor to release one prisoner chosen by the crowd. 16 At that time they had a
notorious prisoner named Barabbas. 17 So when they were gathered together, Pilate
said to them, “Who do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is
called Christ?” 18 He knew that they had handed Jesus over to him because of envy.
19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him and said, “Have
nothing to do with that innocent man. For I have suffered much today because of a
dream I had about him.” 20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd
to ask for Barabbas, and have Jesus killed. 21 The governor asked them, “Which of
the two do you want me to release to you?” They said, “Barabbas.” 22 Pilate said
to them, “What should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all answered,
“Crucify him.” 23 Then he said, “Why, what crime has he done?” But they cried out
even louder, “Crucify him.” 24 So when Pilate saw that he could not do anything, but
instead a riot was starting, he took water, washed his hands in front of the crowd,
and said, “I am innocent of the blood of this innocent man. See to it yourselves.”
25 All the people said, “May his blood be on us and our children.” 26 Then he released
Barabbas to them, but he scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.
27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the government headquarters
and gathered the whole company of soldiers. 28 They stripped him and put a scarlet
robe on him. 29 They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and placed a
staff in his right hand. They knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail,
King of the Jews!” 30 They spat on him, and they took the staff and struck him on the
head again and again. 31 When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him and
put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.
32 As they came out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they
forced to go with them so that he might carry his cross. 33 They came to a place
called Golgotha, which means “The Place of a Skull.” 34 They gave him wine to drink
mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he would not drink. 35 When they had crucified
him, they divided up his garments by casting lots, 36 and they sat and kept guard over
him. 37 Above his head they put the charge against him, which read “This is Jesus,
the king of the Jews.” 38 Two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right of
him and one on the left. 39 Those who passed by insulted him, shaking their heads
40 and saying, “You who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” 41 In the same
way the chief priests were mocking him, along with the scribes and elders, and said,
42 “He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel. Let him
come down off the cross, and then we will believe in him. 43 He trusts in God, let God
rescue him now, if God consents to release him. For he even said, 'I am the Son of
God.'” 44 In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also spoke insults
to him.
45 Now from the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth
hour. 46 About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, “Eli, Eli, lama
sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” 47 WhenMatthew 27:48
1050
Matthew 28:15
some of those who were standing there heard it, they said, “He is calling for Elijah.”
48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it
on a reed staff, and gave it to him to drink. 49 The rest of them said, “Leave him
alone. Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.” 50 Then Jesus cried out again
with a loud voice and gave up his spirit. 51 Behold, the curtain of the temple was split
in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks split apart.
52 The tombs were opened, and the bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were
raised. 53 They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city,
and appeared to many. 54 Now when the centurion and those who were watching
Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they became very afraid
and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.” 55 Many women who had followed Jesus
from Galilee to care for him were there looking on from a distance. 56 Among them
were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the
sons of Zebedee.
57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph,
who was also a disciple of Jesus. 58 He approached Pilate and asked for the body of
Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 Joseph took the body, wrapped it
in a clean linen cloth, 60 and laid it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock.
Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb and went away. 61 Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
62 The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the
Pharisees were gathered together with Pilate. 63 They said, “Sir, we remember that
when that deceiver was alive, he said, 'After three days will I rise again.' 64 Therefore
command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples
may come and steal him and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the
last deception will be worse than the first.” 65 Pilate said to them, “Take a guard. Go
and make it as secure as you can.” 66 So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing
the stone and placing the guard.
28
1 Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 2 Behold, there was a
great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and rolled
away the stone, and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as
white as snow. 4 The guards shook with fear and became like dead men. 5 The angel
addressed the women and said to them, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek
Jesus, who has been crucified. 6 He is not here, but is risen, just as he said. Come see
the place where the Lord lay. 7 Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from
the dead. See, he is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' See, I have
told you.” 8 The women quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell
his disciples. 9 Behold, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” The women came, took
hold of his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go
tell my brothers to leave for Galilee. There they will see me.”
11 Now while the women were going, behold, some of the guards went into the city
and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. 12 When the priests had
met with the elders and discussed the matter with them, they gave a large amount of
money to the soldiers 13 and told them, “Say to others, 'Jesus' disciples came by night
and stole his body while we were sleeping.' 14 If this report reaches the governor, we
will persuade him and take any worries away from you.” 15 So the soldiers took theMatthew 28:16
1051
Matthew 28:20
money and did as they had been instructed. This report spread widely among the
Jews and continues even today.
16 But the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had
directed them. 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. 18 Jesus
came to them and spoke to them and said, “All authority has been given to me in
heaven and on earth. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize
them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. 20 Teach them to
obey all the things that I have commanded you. See, I am with you always, even to
the end of the age.”Mark 1:1
1052
Mark 1:30
Mark
1 This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
“Look, I am sending my messenger before your face,
the one who will prepare your way.
3 The voice of one calling out in the wilderness,
'Make ready the way of the Lord;
make his paths straight.'”
4 John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for
the forgiveness of sins. 5 The whole country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem
went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their
sins. 6 John was wearing a coat of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist,
and he was eating locusts and wild honey.
7 He proclaimed, “One will come after me who is more powerful than I; the strap
of his sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 8 I baptized you with water,
but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
9 It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and he was
baptized by John in the Jordan River. 10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the
heavens split open and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove. 11 A voice came
out of the heavens, “You are my beloved Son. I am very pleased with you.”
12 Then the Spirit compelled him to go out into the wilderness. 13 He was in the
wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and
the angels served him.
14 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of
God. 15 He said, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and
believe in the gospel.”
16 When he was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the
brother of Simon casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen. 17 Jesus said to
them, “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” 18 Then immediately
they left the nets and followed him. 19 As Jesus was walking on a little farther, he
saw James son of Zebedee and John his brother; they were in the boat mending the
nets. 20 He called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired
servants, and they followed him.
21 Then they came into Capernaum, and on the Sabbath, Jesus went into the
synagogue and taught. 22 They were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching
them as someone who has authority and not as the scribes. 23 Just then a man in
their synagogue who had an unclean spirit cried out, 24 saying, “What do we have
to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you
are. You are the Holy One of God!” 25 Jesus rebuked the demon and said, “Be quiet
and come out of him!” 26 The unclean spirit threw him down and went out from
him while crying out with a loud voice. 27 All the people were amazed, so they asked
each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority? He even commands the
unclean spirits and they obey him!” 28 The news about him went out everywhere
into the whole region of Galilee.
29 After coming out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and
Andrew, along with James and John. 30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sickMark 1:31
1053
Mark 2:17
with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. 31 So he came, took her by the hand, and
raised her up; the fever left her, and she started serving them.
32 That evening, after the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick or
possessed by demons. 33 The whole city gathered together at the door. 34 He healed
many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons, but he did not
allow the demons to speak because they knew him.
35 He got up very early, while it was still dark; he left and went out into a solitary
place and there he prayed. 36 Simon and those who were with him searched for him.
37 They found him and they said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” 38 He said,
“Let us go elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also.
That is why I came out here.” 39 He went throughout all of Galilee, preaching in their
synagogues and casting out demons.
40 A leper came to him. He was begging him; he knelt down and said to him, “If you
are willing, you can make me clean.” 41 Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out
his hand and touched him, saying to him, “I am willing. Be clean.” 42 Immediately
the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. 43 Jesus strictly warned him and sent
him away. 44 He said to him, “Be sure to say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself
to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to
them.” 45 But he went out and began to spread the news widely, so much that Jesus
could no longer enter a town openly but he stayed out in remote places. Yet people
were still coming to him from everywhere.
2
1 When he came back to Capernaum after a few days, it was heard that he was
at home. 2 So many gathered there that there was no more space, not even at the
door, and Jesus spoke the word to them. 3 Then some men came to him who were
bringing a paralyzed man; four people were carrying him. 4 When they could not
get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof that was above Jesus, and
after they made an opening, they lowered the bed the paralyzed man was lying on.
5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, and they reasoned in their hearts, 7 “How
can this man speak this way? He blasphemes! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit what they were thinking among themselves.
He said to them, “Why are you thinking this in your hearts? 9 What is easier to say to
the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and
walk'? 10 But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth
to forgive sins,” he said to the paralytic, 11 “I say to you, get up, take up your mat,
and go to your house.” 12 He got up and immediately took up the mat, and went out
of the house in front of everyone, so that they were all amazed and they gave glory
to God, and they said, “We never saw anything like this.”
13 He went out again by the lake, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught
them. 14 As he passed by, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's
tent and he said to him, “Follow me.” He got up and followed him.
15 Jesus was having a meal in Levi's house and many tax collectors and sinful
people were dining with him and his disciples, for there were many and they followed
him. 16 When the scribes, who were Pharisees, saw that Jesus was eating with the
sinful people and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax
collectors and sinful people?” 17 When Jesus heard this he said to them, “People who
are strong in body do not need a physician; only people who are sick need one. I did
not come to call righteous people, but sinful people.”Mark 2:18
1054
Mark 3:22
18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and said
to him, “Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your
disciples do not fast?” 19 Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding attendants fast while
the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them,
they cannot fast. 20 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away
from them, and in those days, they will fast. 21 No man sews a piece of new cloth on
an old garment, otherwise the patch will tear away from it, the new from the old, and
there will be a worse tear. 22 No man puts new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the
wine will burst the skins and both the wine and the wineskins will be lost. Instead,
put new wine into fresh wineskins.”
23 On the Sabbath day Jesus went through some grainfields, and his disciples began
to pick heads of grain. 24 The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing
something that is not lawful on the Sabbath day?” 25 He said to them, “Have you
never read what David did when he was in need and hungry—he and the men who
were with him— 26 how he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest,
and ate the bread of the presence, which it is unlawful for anyone to eat except the
priests, and he even gave some to those who were with him?” 27 Jesus said, “The
Sabbath was made for mankind, not mankind for the Sabbath. 28 Therefore, the Son
of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath.”
3
1 Again Jesus walked into the synagogue and there was a man with a withered hand.
2 Some people watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath so that
they could accuse him. 3 Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and
stand here in the middle of everyone.” 4 Then he said to the people, “Is it lawful to
do good on the Sabbath day or to do harm; to save a life or to kill?” But they were
silent. 5 He looked around at them with anger, and he was grieved by their hardness
of heart, and he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and
his hand was restored. 6 The Pharisees went out and immediately began to plot with
the Herodians as to how they might put him to death.
7 Then Jesus, with his disciples, went to the sea, and a great crowd of people followed
from Galilee and from Judea 8 and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the
Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. When they heard about the things he was doing,
a great crowd came to him. 9 He asked his disciples to have a small boat ready for
him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush him. 10 For he healed many,
so that everyone who had afflictions eagerly approached him in order to touch him.
11 Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out,
and they said, “You are the Son of God.” 12 He strictly ordered them not to make him
known.
13 He went up on the mountain, and he called for those he wanted, and they came
to him. 14 He appointed the twelve (whom he named apostles) so that they might be
with him and he might send them to proclaim the message, 15 and to have authority
to cast out demons. 16 Then he appointed the twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the
name Peter; 17 James son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, to whom he gave
the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder; 18 and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, 19 and Judas
Iscariot, who would betray him.
20 Then he went home, and the crowd came together again, so that they could not
even eat bread. 21 When his family heard about it, they went out to seize him, for
they said, “He is out of his mind.” 22 The scribes who came down from JerusalemMark 3:23
1055
Mark 4:20
said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul” and “By the ruler of the demons he drives out
demons.” 23 Jesus called them to him and said to them in parables, “How can Satan
cast out Satan? 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
25 If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 26 If Satan
has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has come to an
end. 27 But no one can enter into the house of a strong man and steal his belongings
without tying up the strong man first, and then he will plunder his house. 28 Truly
I say to you, all sins of the sons of men will be forgiven, even all the blasphemies
which they utter, 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never have
forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.” 30 Jesus said this because they were saying,
“He has an unclean spirit.”
31 Then his mother and his brothers came and stood outside. They sent for him,
summoning him. 32 A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, “Your
mother and your brothers are outside, and they are looking for you.” 33 He answered
them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” 34 He looked around at those who were
sitting in a circle around him and said, “See, here are my mother and my brothers!
35 For whoever does the will of God, that person is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
4
1 Again he began to teach beside the sea, and a large crowd gathered around him.
He stepped into a boat that was on the sea, and he sat down in it. The whole crowd
was on the shore beside the sea. 2 He taught them many things in parables, and in
his teaching, this is what he said to them. 3 “Listen, the farmer went out to sow his
seed. 4 As he sowed, some seed fell on the road, and the birds came and devoured it.
5 Other seed fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. Immediately it
sprang up, because it did not have deep soil. 6 But when the sun rose, the plants were
scorched, and because they had no root, they dried up. 7 Other seed fell among the
thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up and choked it, and it did not produce a crop.
8 Other seed fell into good soil and it produced a crop growing up and increasing
thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times.” 9 Then he said, “Whoever has ears to hear,
let him hear!”
10 When Jesus was alone, those who were close to him and with the twelve asked
him about the parables. 11 He said to them, “To you is given the mystery of the
kingdom of God. But to those outside everything is in parables,
12 so that when they look, yes they look, but do not see,
and so that when they hear, yes they hear, but do not understand,
or else they would turn and God would forgive them.”
13 Then he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you
understand all the other parables? 14 The farmer who sows his seed is the one who
sows the word. 15 These are the ones that fall beside the road, where the word was
sown, but when they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word
that was sown in them. 16 These are the ones that are sown on rocky ground, who,
when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. 17 They have no root
in themselves, but endure for a short time. Then tribulation or persecution comes
because of the word, and immediately they stumble. 18 The others are the ones that
were sown among the thorns. They hear the word, 19 but the cares of the world, the
deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things enter in and choke the word,
and it does not produce a crop. 20 Then those that were sown in the good soil are
the ones who hear the word and receive it, and they produce crops—thirty, sixty, or
a hundred times what was sown.”Mark 4:21
1056
Mark 5:14
21 Jesus said to them, “Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket,
or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a lampstand. 22 For nothing is
hidden that will not be known, and nothing is secret that will not come out into the
open. 23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!” 24 He said to them, “Pay attention
to what you hear, for the measure you use will be measured to you, and more will be
added to you. 25 Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and whoever does
not have, even what he has will be taken.”
26 He also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who sows his seed on the ground.
27 He sleeps at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he
does not know how. 28 The earth bears grain by itself: First the blade, then the ear,
then the mature grain in the ear. 29 When the crop is ripe, he immediately sends in
the sickle because the harvest has come.”
30 Again he said, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable
can we use to explain it? 31 It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown, is the
smallest of all the seeds on earth. 32 Yet, when it is sown, it grows and becomes
greater than all the garden plants, and it forms large branches, so that the birds of
heaven can make their nests in its shade.”
33 With many parables like this he spoke the word to them, as much as they were
able to understand, 34 and he did not speak to them without a parable. But when he
was alone, he explained everything to his own disciples.
35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go over to the
other side.” 36 So they left the crowd, taking Jesus with them, just as he was, in the
boat. There were other boats going along with him. 37 Just then a violent windstorm
arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was almost full of
water. 38 But Jesus himself was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke him up,
saying, “Teacher, do you not care that we are about to die?” 39 He got up, rebuked
the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was
a great calm. 40 Then he said to them, “Why are you afraid? Do you still not have
faith?” 41 They were filled with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this,
because even the wind and the sea obey him?”
5
1 They came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes. 2 When
Jesus was getting out of the boat, immediately there came up to him out of the tombs
a man with an unclean spirit. 3 The man lived in the tombs. No one could restrain
him anymore, not even with a chain. 4 He had been bound many times with shackles
and with chains. He tore the chains apart and his shackles were shattered. No one
had the strength to subdue him. 5 Every night and day in the tombs and in the
mountains, he cried out and cut himself with sharp stones. 6 When he saw Jesus
from a distance, he ran to him and bowed down before him. 7 He cried out with a
loud voice, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg
you by God himself, do not torment me.” 8 For he had been saying to him, “Come out
of the man, you unclean spirit.” 9 He asked him, “What is your name?” He answered
him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” 10 He begged him again and again not
to send them out of the region. 11 Now a great herd of pigs was there feeding on the
hill, 12 and they begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs; let us enter into them.”
13 So he allowed them; the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and
they rushed down the steep hill into the sea, and about two thousand pigs drowned
in the sea. 14 Then those who were feeding the pigs ran away and reported what had
happened in the city and in the countryside, and so people went out to see what hadMark 5:15
1057
Mark 6:2
happened. 15 Then they came to Jesus and they saw the demon-possessed man, the
one who had been possessed by Legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind;
and they were afraid. 16 Those who had seen what happened to the demon-possessed
man told them about it in detail, and they also them told about the pigs. 17 Then they
started to beg him to leave their region. 18 When he was getting into the boat, the
demon-possessed man begged him that he might be with him. 19 But Jesus did not
permit him, but said to him, “Go to your house and to your people and tell them what
the Lord has done for you, and how he has shown you mercy.” 20 So he went away
and began to proclaim the great things that Jesus had done for him in the Decapolis,
and everyone was amazed.
21 Now when Jesus had crossed over again to the other side, in the boat, a great
crowd gathered around him, as he was beside the sea. 22 Then one of the leaders
of the synagogue, named Jairus, came, and when he saw him, fell at his feet. 23 He
begged again and again, saying, “My little daughter is near death. I beg you, come
and lay your hands on her that she may be made well and live.” 24 So he went with
him, and a great crowd followed him and pressed close around him.
25 Now a woman was there who had a flow of blood for twelve years. 26 She had
suffered much from many doctors and had spent everything that she had, but instead
of getting better she grew worse. 27 When she had heard the reports about Jesus, she
came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak. 28 For she said, “If I touch
just his clothes, I will be healed.” 29 When she touched him, the bleeding stopped,
and she felt in her body that she was healed from her affliction. 30 Jesus immediately
realized in himself that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the
crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” 31 His disciples said to him, “You see
this crowd pressed around you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'” 32 But Jesus looked
around to see who had done it. 33 The woman, knowing what had happened to her,
feared and trembled. She came and fell down before him and told him the whole
truth. 34 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be
healed from your disease.”
35 While he was speaking, some people came from the leader of the synagogue,
saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any longer?” 36 But when
Jesus overheard what they said, he said to the leader of the synagogue, “Do not be
afraid. Just believe.” 37 He did not permit anyone to accompany him, except Peter,
James, and John, the brother of James. 38 They came to the house of the leader of the
synagogue and he saw there people making a lot of noise; they were weeping and
wailing loudly. 39 When he entered the house, he said to them, “Why are you upset
and why do you weep? The child is not dead but sleeps.” 40 They laughed at him.
But he put them all outside and took the father of the child and the mother and those
who were with him, and he went in where the child was. 41 He took the hand of the
child and said to her, “Talitha, koum!” which being translated would be, “Little girl,
I say to you, get up.” 42 Immediately the child got up and walked (for she was twelve
years of age). They were immediately astonished with overwhelming amazement.
43 He strictly ordered them that no one should know about this. Then he told them
to give her something to eat.
6
1 He went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed
him. 2 When the Sabbath came, he taught in the synagogue. Many people heard him
and they were amazed. They said, “Where did he get these teachings?” “What is this
wisdom that has been given to him?” “What are these miracles that he does with hisMark 6:3
1058
Mark 6:36
hands?” 3 “Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and
Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?” They were offended
by Jesus. 4 Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his
hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.” 5 He was unable
to do any mighty work, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
6 He was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.
7 Then he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and he gave
them authority over the unclean spirits, 8 and instructed them to take nothing for
their journey, except a staff—no bread, no bag, and no money in their belts— 9 but to
wear sandals, and not to wear two tunics. 10 He said to them, “Whenever you enter
a house, remain until you go away from there. 11 If any town will not receive you or
listen to you, when you leave that place, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony
to them.” 12 They went out and proclaimed that people should turn away from their
sins. 13 They cast out many demons, and anointed many sick people with oil and
healed them.
14 King Herod heard this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were
saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these
miraculous powers are at work in him.” 15 Some others said, “He is Elijah.” Still
others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets in ancient times.” 16 But when
Herod heard this he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.” 17 For Herod
sent to have John arrested and he had him bound in prison on account of Herodias
(his brother Philip's wife), because he had married her. 18 For John told Herod, “It
is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.” 19 But Herodias held on to anger
against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not, 20 for Herod feared John; he
knew that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. Listening to him
made him greatly upset, yet he heard him gladly. 21 Then the opportunity came when
Herod had his birthday and he made a dinner for his officials, and his commanders,
and leaders of Galilee. 22 The daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced for
them, and she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me
for anything you want and I will give it to you.” 23 He swore to her saying, “Whatever
you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.” 24 She went out and said to
her mother, “What should I ask him for?” She said, “The head of John the Baptist.”
25 She immediately hurried back to the king, and she asked, saying, “I want you to
give me, right now, the head of John the Baptist on a wooden platter.” 26 Though this
deeply grieved the king, he could not refuse her request because of the oath he had
made and because of his dinner guests. 27 So the king sent a soldier from his guard
and commanded him to bring him John's head. The guard went and beheaded him
in the prison. 28 He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl
gave it to her mother. 29 When his disciples heard of this, they came and took his
body and placed it in a tomb.
30 The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.
31 Then he said to them, “Come away by yourselves into a deserted place and rest a
while.” For many were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.
32 So they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. 33 But they saw
them leaving and many recognized them, and they ran there together on foot from
all the towns, and they arrived there before them. 34 When they came ashore, he saw
a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without
a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things. 35 When the hour was late, his
disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place and the hour is already late.
36 Send them away so that they may go into the nearby countryside and villages toMark 6:37
1059
Mark 7:12
buy something to eat for themselves.” 37 But he answered and said to them, “You give
them something to eat.” They said to him, “Can we go and buy two hundred denarii
worth of bread and give it to them to eat?” 38 He said to them, “How many loaves
do you have? Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five loaves and two
fish.” 39 He commanded all the people to sit down in groups upon the green grass.
40 They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 41 He took the five loaves and the
two fish, and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them
to the disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them
all. 42 They all ate until they were satisfied. 43 They took up broken pieces of bread,
twelve baskets full, and also pieces of the fish. 44 There were five thousand men who
ate the loaves.
45 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the
other side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the crowd away. 46 When they were gone,
he went up the mountain to pray. 47 Evening came, and the boat was now in the
middle of the sea, and he was alone on land. 48 He saw that they straining against the
oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came
to them, walking on the sea, and he wanted to pass by them. 49 But when they saw
him walking on the sea, they thought he was a ghost and cried out, 50 because they
saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said to them, “Be
courageous! It is I! Do not be afraid!” 51 He got into the boat with them, and the wind
ceased blowing. They were completely amazed. 52 For they had not understood what
the loaves meant. Instead, their hearts were hardened.
53 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored the
boat. 54 When they came out of the boat, the people recognized him immediately,
55 and they ran throughout the whole region and began to bring the sick on their
mats to wherever they heard he was. 56 Wherever he entered into villages, or cities,
or into the country, they would put the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to
let them touch the edge of his garment, and as many as touched him were healed.
7
1 The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered
around him. 2 They saw that some of his disciples ate bread with hands that were
defiled, that is, unwashed. 3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless
they wash their hands, because they hold to the tradition of the elders. 4 When the
Pharisees come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they bathe themselves,
and they hold fast to many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pots, copper
vessels, and the couches upon which they eat.) 5 The Pharisees and the scribes asked
Jesus, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, for
they eat their bread with unwashed hands?” 6 But he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied
well about you hypocrites. He wrote,
'This people honors me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me.
7 Empty worship they offer me,
teaching the rules of men as their doctrines.'
8 You abandon the commandment of God and hold fast to the tradition of men.” 9 He
also said to them, “How well you reject the commandment of God so you may keep
your tradition! 10 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who
speaks evil of his father or mother will surely die.' 11 But you say, 'If a man says to
his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is Corban”'
(that is to say, 'Given to God'), 12 then you no longer permit him to do anything forMark 7:13
1060
Mark 8:8
his father or his mother. 13 You are making the commandment of God void by your
tradition which you have handed down. And many similar things you do.” 14 He
called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand.
15 There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into
him. It is what comes out of the person that defiles him.” 16 * 17 Now when Jesus left
the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. 18 Jesus
said, “Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters
into a person from outside cannot defile him, 19 because it cannot go into his heart,
but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine?” With this statement
Jesus declared all foods clean. 20 He said, “It is that which comes out of the person
that defiles him. 21 For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts,
sexual immorality, theft, murder, 22 adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality,
envy, slander, pride, folly. 23 All these evils come from within, and they are what
defile a person.”
24 He got up from there and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. There
he went into a house and he wanted no one to know where he was, but he could
not be hidden. 25 In fact † , as soon a woman whose little daughter had an unclean
spirit heard about him, she came and fell down at his feet. 26 Now the woman was a
Greek, a Syrophoenician by descent. She begged him to cast out the demon from her
daughter. 27 He said to her, “Let the children first be fed. For it is not right to take
the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” 28 But she answered and said to him,
“Yes, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.” 29 He said to
her, “Because you have said this, you are free to go. The demon has gone out of your
daughter.” 30 She went back to her house and found the child lying on the bed, and
the demon was gone.
31 Then he went out again from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the
Sea of Galilee up into the region of the Decapolis. 32 They brought to him someone
who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged him to lay his hand on
him. 33 He took him aside from the crowd privately, and he put his fingers into his
ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven, he sighed
and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is to say, “Open!” 35 At once his ears were opened,
his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly. 36 Jesus ordered them to tell
no one. But the more he ordered them, the more abundantly they proclaimed it.
37 They were extremely astonished, saying, “He has done all things well. He even
makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
8
1 In those days, there was again a great crowd, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus
called his disciples and said to them, 2 “I have compassion on the crowd, because they
continue to be with me already for three days and have nothing to eat. 3 If I send them
away to their home without eating, they may faint on the way. Some of them have
come a long way.” 4 His disciples answered him, “Where can we get enough loaves of
bread in such a deserted place to satisfy these people?” 5 He asked them, “How many
loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.” 6 He commanded the crowd to sit down on
the ground. He took the seven loaves, gave thanks, and broke them. He gave them to
his disciples to set before them, and they set them before the crowd. 7 They also had
a few small fish, and after he gave thanks for them, he commanded the disciples to
serve these as well. 8 They ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the remaining

broken pieces, seven large baskets. 9 There were about four thousand people. Then
he sent them away. 10 Immediately he got into the boat with his disciples, and they
went into the region of Dalmanutha.
11 Then the Pharisees came out and began to argue with him. They sought from
him a sign from heaven, to test him. 12 He sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why
does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this
generation.” 13 Then he left them, got into a boat again, and went away to the other
side.
14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread with them. They had no more
than one loaf of bread in the boat. 15 He warned them and said, “Keep watch and be
on guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.” 16 The disciples
reasoned with each other, “It is because we have no bread.” 17 Jesus was aware of
this, and he said to them, “Why are you reasoning about not having bread? Do you
not yet perceive? Do you not understand? Have your hearts become so dull? 18 You
have eyes, do you not see? You have ears, do you not hear? Do you not remember?
19 When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of
broken pieces of bread did you take up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” 20 “When I
broke the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many basketfuls did you take
up?” They said to him, “Seven.” 21 He said, “Do you not yet understand?”
22 They came to Bethsaida. The people there brought to him a blind man and begged
Jesus to touch him. 23 Jesus took hold of the blind man by the hand, and led him out
of the village. When he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him,
“Do you see anything?” 24 He looked up, and said, “I see men who look like walking
trees.” 25 Then he again laid his hands upon his eyes, and the man opened his eyes,
his sight was restored, and he saw all things clearly. 26 Jesus sent him away to his
home and said, “Do not enter the town.”
27 Jesus went out with his disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way
he asked his disciples, “Who do the people say that I am?” 28 They answered him and
said, “John the Baptist. Others say, 'Elijah,' and others, 'One of the prophets.'” 29 He
asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter said to him, “You are the Christ.”
30 Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
31 He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and would
be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and would be killed,
and after three days rise up. 32 He said this clearly. Then Peter took him aside and
began to rebuke him. 33 But Jesus turned and looked at his disciples and then he
rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! You are not setting your mind on
the things of God, but on the things of people.” 34 Then he called the crowd and his
disciples together, and he said to them, “If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny
himself, take up his cross, and follow me. 35 For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel, will save it. 36 What
does it profit a person to gain the whole world and then forfeit his life? 37 What can a
person give in exchange for his life? 38 Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in
this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when
he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”

1 He said to them, “Truly I say to you, there are some of you who are standing
here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.”
2 Six days later, Jesus took Peter and James and John with him up a high mountain,
alone by themselves. Then he was transfigured before them. 3 His garments becameMark 9:4
1062
Mark 9:37
radiantly brilliant, extremely white, whiter than any bleacher on earth could bleach
them. 4 Then Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
5 Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here, and so let us
make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 6 (For he did
not know what to say, for they were terrified.) 7 A cloud came and overshadowed
them. Then a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”
8 Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them, but only
Jesus.
9 As they were coming down the mountain, he commanded them to tell no one
what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 10 So they kept
the matter to themselves, but they discussed among themselves what “rising from
the dead” could mean. 11 They asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must
come first?” 12 He said to them, “Elijah does come first to restore all things. Why then
is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be despised? 13 But I
say to you that Elijah has come, and they did whatever they wanted to him, just as
scripture says about him.”
14 When they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them and scribes
were arguing with them. 15 As soon as they saw Jesus, the whole crowd was amazed
and as they ran up to him they greeted him. 16 He asked his disciples, “What are
you arguing with them about?” 17 Someone in the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I
brought my son to you. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak. 18 It seizes
him and it throws him down and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and he
becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they could not.” 19 He
answered them, “Unbelieving generation, how long will I have to stay with you? How
long will I bear with you? Bring him to me.” 20 They brought the boy to him. When
the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw him into a convulsion. The boy fell on
the ground and foamed at the mouth. 21 Jesus asked his father, “How long has he
been like this?” The father said, “Since childhood. 22 It has often thrown him into
the fire or into the waters and tried to destroy him. If you are able to do anything,
have pity on us and help us.” 23 Jesus said to him, “'If you are able'? All things are
possible for the one who believes.” 24 Immediately the father of the child cried out
and said, “I believe! Help my unbelief!” 25 When Jesus saw the crowd running to
them, he rebuked the unclean spirit and said, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command
you, come out of him, and never enter into him again.” 26 It cried out and convulsed
the boy greatly and then came out. The boy looked like one who was dead, so that
many said, “He is dead.” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and the
boy stood up. 28 When Jesus came into the house, his disciples asked him privately,
“Why could we not cast it out?” 29 He said to them, “This kind cannot be cast out
except by prayer.”
30 They went out from there and passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone
to know where they were, 31 for he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, “The
Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will put him to death.
When he has been put to death, after three days he will rise again.” 32 But they did
not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask him.
33 Then they came to Capernaum. After he entered the house he asked them, “What
were you discussing on the way?” 34 But they were silent. For they had been arguing
with one with another on the way about who was the greatest. 35 Sitting down, he
called the twelve together and he said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must
be last of all and servant of all.” 36 He took a little child and placed him in their midst.
He took him in his arms and said to them, 37 “Whoever receives such a child in myMark 9:38
1063
Mark 10:21
name receives me; and whoever receives me, does not receive me but the one who
sent me.” 38 John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your
name and we stopped him, because he does not follow us.” 39 But Jesus said, “Do
not stop him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and can
soon afterwards say anything bad about me. 40 Whoever is not against us is for us.
41 Whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, truly I say
to you, he will not lose his reward. 42 Whoever causes one of these little ones who
believes in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied
around his neck and be thrown into the sea. 43 If your hand causes you to stumble,
cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and
to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 44 * 45 If your foot causes you to stumble,
cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to have your two feet and be
thrown into hell. 46 † 47 If your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out. It is better for
you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be
thrown into hell, 48 where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out. 49 For
everyone will be salted with fire. 50 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness,
how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with
one another.”
10
1 Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and to the area beyond the
Jordan River, and the crowds came to him again. He was teaching them again, as
he was accustomed to do. 2 Then Pharisees came to him to test him and asked, “Is it
lawful for a husband to divorce his wife?” 3 He answered, “What did Moses command
you?” 4 They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and then to
send her away.” 5 “It was because of your hard hearts that he wrote you this law,”
Jesus said to them. 6 “But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and
female.'
7 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
8 and the two shall become one flesh.'
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 9 Therefore what God has joined together, let
no man tear apart.” 10 When they were in the house, the disciples asked him again
about this. 11 He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another
woman commits adultery against her. 12 If she divorces her husband and marries
another man, she commits adultery.”
13 Then they brought their little children to him so that he might touch them, but
the disciples rebuked them. 14 But when Jesus noticed it, he was very displeased
and said to them, “Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them,
for the kingdom of God belongs to those who are like them. 15 Truly I say to you,
whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will definitely not enter
it.” 16 Then he took the children into his arms and blessed them as he placed his
hands on them.
17 When he began his journey, a man ran up to him and knelt before him, and
asked, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 Jesus said, “Why do
you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 You know the commandments:
'Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not testify falsely, do not defraud,
honor your father and mother'.” 20 The man said, “Teacher, all these things I have
obeyed from the time I was a youth.” 21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. He said

to him, “One thing you lack. You must sell all that you have and give it to the poor,
and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” 22 But because of this
statement he looked very sad and he went away distressed, because he had many
possessions.
23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it is for those who
are rich to enter the kingdom of God!” 24 The disciples were astonished at his words.
But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter into the kingdom
of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
person to enter the kingdom of God.” 26 They were greatly astonished and said to each
other, “Then who can be saved?” 27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With people it is
impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” 28 Peter began to
speak to him, “Look, we have left everything and have followed you.” 29 Jesus said,
“Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or
mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel, 30 who will
not receive a hundred times as much now in this world: houses, and brothers, and
sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to
come, eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
32 They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them.
The disciples were amazed, and those who were following behind were afraid. Then
Jesus took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what would soon happen to
him. 33 “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to
the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and deliver him
to the Gentiles. 34 They will mock him, spit on him, whip him, and put him to death.
But after three days he will rise.”
35 James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said, “Teacher, we
want you to do for us whatever we ask you.” 36 He said to them, “What do you want
me to do for you?” 37 They said, “Allow us to sit with you in your glory, one at your
right hand and the other at your left.” 38 But Jesus replied to them, “You do not know
what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I will drink or endure the
baptism with which I will be baptized?” 39 They said to him, “We are able.” Jesus said
to them, “The cup that I will drink, you will drink, and with the baptism with which
I am baptized, you also will be baptized. 40 But who is to sit at my right hand or at
my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”
41 When the other ten disciples heard about this, they began to be very angry with
James and John. 42 Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know those who are
considered rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their high officials exercise
authority over them. 43 But it shall not be this way among you. Whoever wishes to
become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wishes to be first
among you must be the slave of all. 45 For the Son of Man did not come to be served,
but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
46 They came to Jericho. As he left Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, the
son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, sat by the road. 47 When he heard that
it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout and to say, “Jesus, Son of David, have
mercy on me!” 48 Many rebuked the blind man, telling him to be quiet. But he cried
out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 49 Jesus stopped and commanded
him to be called. They called the blind man, saying, “Be brave! Get up! He is calling
for you.” 50 He threw aside his coat, sprang up, and came to Jesus. 51 Jesus answered
him and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said, “Rabbi, I
want to receive my sight.” 52 Then Jesus said to him, “Go. Your faith has healed you.”
Immediately he could see again, and he followed him on the road.Mark 11:1

1 Now as they came to Jerusalem, they were close to Bethphage and Bethany, at the
Mount of Olives, and Jesus sent out two of his disciples 2 and said to them, “Go into
the village opposite us. As soon as you enter it, you will find a colt that has never
been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me. 3 If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing
this?' you should say, 'The Lord has need of it and will immediately send it back
here.'” 4 They went away and found a colt tied at a door outside on the open street,
and they untied it. 5 Some people were standing there and said to them, “What are
you doing, untying that colt?” 6 They spoke to them as Jesus told them, and the people
let them go their way. 7 The two disciples brought the colt to Jesus and threw their
cloaks on it so Jesus could ride it. 8 Many people spread their garments on the road,
and others spread branches they had cut from the fields. 9 Those who went before
him and those who followed shouted,
“Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.
10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!
Hosanna in the highest!”
11 Then Jesus entered into Jerusalem and went into the temple and looked around
at everything. Now, the time being late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
12 The next day, when they returned from Bethany, he was hungry. 13 Seeing from
far away a fig tree that had leaves, he went to see if he could find any fruit on it, and
when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
14 He spoke to it, “No one will ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard
it.
15 They came to Jerusalem, and he entered the temple and began to cast out the
sellers and the buyers in the temple. He turned over the tables of the money changers
and the seats of those who sold pigeons. 16 He did not allow anyone to carry anything
through the temple that could be sold. 17 He taught them and said, “Is it not written,
'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations'?
But you have made it a den of robbers.”
18 The chief priests and the scribes heard what he had said, and they looked for a
way to kill him. For they feared him because the entire crowd was amazed at his
teaching. 19 When evening came, they left the city.
20 As they walked by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.
21 Peter remembered and said, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered
away.” 22 Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. 23 Truly I say to you that whoever
says to this mountain, 'Get up and cast yourself into the sea,' and if he does not doubt
in his heart but believes that what he said will happen, that is what God will do.
24 Therefore I say to you: Everything you pray and ask for, believe that you received
it, and it will be yours. 25 When you stand and pray, you must forgive whatever you
have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your
trespasses.” 26 *
27 They came to Jerusalem again. As Jesus was walking in the temple, the chief
priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him. 28 They said to him, “By what
authority do you do these things, and who gave you the authority to do them?”
29 Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Tell me and I will tell you by
what authority I do these things. 30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from
men? Answer me.” 31 They discussed between themselves and argued and said, “If
we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 32 But if we
* 11:26 The best ancient copies omit this verse (See: Mt. 6:15) Mk. 11:26 But if you do not forgive, neither will
your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses .Mark 11:33
1066
Mark 12:29
say, 'From men,' ... .” They were afraid of the people, for everyone was convinced
that John was a prophet. 33 Then they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.”
Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
12
1 Then Jesus began to teach them in parables. He said, “A man planted a vineyard,
put a hedge around it, and dug a pit for a winepress. He built a watchtower and then
leased the vineyard to vine growers. Then he went away on a journey. 2 At the right
time, he sent a servant to the vine growers to receive from them some of the fruit of
the vineyard. 3 But they took him, beat him, and sent him away with nothing. 4 Again
he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head and treated him
shamefully. 5 He sent yet another, and this one they killed. They treated many others
in the same way, beating some and killing others. 6 He had still one more person to
send, a beloved son. He was the last one he sent to them. He said, 'They will respect
my son.' 7 But the vine growers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill
him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 8 They seized him, killed him, and threw him
out of the vineyard. 9 Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will
come and destroy the vine growers and will give the vineyard to others. 10 Have you
not read this scripture?
'The stone which the builders rejected
has been made the cornerstone.
11 This was from the Lord,
and it is marvelous in our eyes.'”
12 They sought to arrest Jesus, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that he had
spoken this parable against them. So they left him and went away.
13 Then they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him to trap him with
words. 14 When they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you care for
no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people. You truly teach
the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not?”
15 But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them, “Why do you test me? Bring me
a denarius so I can look at it.” 16 They brought one to Jesus. He said to them, “Whose
likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar's.” 17 Jesus said, “Give to Caesar
the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” They marveled at
him.
18 Then Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him,
saying, 19 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife
behind him, but no child, the man should take the brother's wife, and raise up a
descendant for his brother.' 20 There were seven brothers; the first took a wife and
then died, leaving no children. 21 Then the second took her and died, leaving no
children, and the third likewise. 22 The seven left no children. Last of all, the woman
also died. 23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For
all seven brothers had her as their wife.” 24 Jesus said, “Is this not the reason you are
mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures nor the power of God? 25 For when
they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are
like angels in heaven. 26 But concerning the dead that are raised, have you not read
in the Book of Moses, in the account about the bush, how God spoke to him and said,
'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? 27 He is not
the God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite mistaken.”
28 One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered
them well. He asked him, “What commandment is the most important of all?” 29 JesusMark 12:30
1067
Mark 13:12
answered, “The most important is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
30 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all
your mind, and with all your strength.' 31 The second commandment is this, 'You
must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other greater commandment than
these.” 32 The scribe said, “Good, Teacher! You have truly said that God is one, and
that there is no other besides him. 33 To love him with all the heart and with all the
understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is even
more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” 34 When Jesus saw that he had given a
wise answer, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that,
no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions.
35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said, “How is it that the scribes
say the Christ is the son of David? 36 David himself, in the Holy Spirit, said,
'The Lord said to my Lord,
“Sit at my right hand,
until I make your enemies your footstool.”'
37 David himself calls him 'Lord,' so how can the Christ be David's son?” The large
crowd gladly listened to him.
38 In his teaching Jesus said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes
and they like the greetings they receive in the marketplaces 39 and they like to have the
chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts. 40 They also devour widows'
houses, and they pray long prayers for people to see. These men will receive greater
condemnation.”
41 Then Jesus sat down across from an offering box in the temple area; he was
watching people as they dropped their money into the box. Many rich people put in
large amounts of money. 42 Then a poor widow came and put in two mites, worth
about a penny. 43 He called his disciples and said to them, “Truly I say to you, this
poor widow has put in more than all of them who contributed to the offering box.
44 For all of them gave out of their abundance. But this widow, out of her poverty,
put in all of the money which she had to live on. “
13
1 As Jesus was walking away from the temple, one of his disciples said to him,
“Teacher, look at the wonderful stones and wonderful buildings!” 2 He said to him,
“Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another which will
not be torn down.”
3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and
Andrew asked him privately, 4 “Tell us, when will these things happen? What will be
the sign when all these things are about to happen?” 5 Jesus began to say to them,
“Be careful that no one leads you astray. 6 Many will come in my name and say, 'I am
he,' and they will lead many astray. 7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars,
do not worry; these things must happen, but the end is not yet. 8 For nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many
places, and famines. These are the beginnings of birth pains.
9 Be on your guard. They will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten
in synagogues. You will stand before both governors and kings for my sake, as a
testimony to them. 10 But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.
11 When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry about what you should say.
For in that hour, what you should say will be given to you; it will not be you who
speak, but the Holy Spirit. 12 Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his
child. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.Mark 13:13
1068
Mark 14:7
13 You will be hated by everyone because of my name.
But whoever endures to the
end, that person will be saved.
14 When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be
standing (let the reader understand), let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
15 let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house or take anything out of
it, 16 and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak. 17 But woe to those
who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days! 18 Pray that it
might not occur in the winter. 19 For there will be great tribulation, such as has not
been from the beginning, when God created the world, until now, no, nor ever will
be again. 20 Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would be saved. But for
the sake of the elect, those whom he chose, he cut short the days. 21 Then if anyone
says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. 22 For
false Christs and false prophets will appear and will give signs and wonders, so as to
deceive, if possible, even the elect. 23 Be on guard! I have told you all these things
ahead of time.
24 But after the tribulation of those days,
the sun will be darkened,
the moon will not give its light,
25 the stars will fall from the sky,
and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
26 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and
glory. 27 Then he will send his angels and he will gather together his elect from the
four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.
28 Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as the branch becomes tender and puts
out its leaves, you know that summer is near. 29 So also, when you see these things
happening, you know that he is near, close to the gates. 30 Truly I say to you, this
generation will not pass away until all of these things occur. 31 Heaven and earth will
pass away, but my words will never pass away. 32 But concerning that day or that
hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
33 Be alert! Watch, because you do not know what time it is. * 34 It is like a man who
goes on a journey—he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge of the house,
each one with his work, and he commands the watchman to stay awake. 35 Therefore
stay alert, because you do not know when the master of the house will come home;
it could be in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning.
36 If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping. 37 What I say to you I say
to everyone: Watch!”
14
1 It was now two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
The chief priests and the scribes were considering how they might stealthily arrest
Jesus and then kill him. 2 For they were saying, “Not during the feast, so that a riot
does not arise among the people.”
3 While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at
the table, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very costly liquid, which
was pure nard. She broke the jar and poured it on his head. 4 But there were some
who were angry. They spoke among themselves and said, “What is the reason for this
waste? 5 This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,
and given to the poor.” Then they scolded her. 6 But Jesus said, “Leave her alone.
Why are you troubling her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. 7 You always
* 13:33 Some ancient authorities read: Be alert! Watch and pray .Mark 14:8
1069
Mark 14:40
have the poor with you, and whenever you desire you can do good to them, but you
will not always have me. 8 She has done what she could. She has anointed my body
for burial. 9 Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world,
what this woman has done will be spoken of, in memory of her.”
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests so that he
might deliver him over to them. 11 When the chief priests heard it, they were glad
and promised to give him money. He began looking for an opportunity to deliver him
to them.
12 On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb,
his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go to prepare, so you may eat the
Passover meal?” 13 He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city,
and a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him. 14 Where he enters
a house, follow him in and say to the owner of that house, 'The Teacher says, “Where
is my guest room where I will eat the Passover with my disciples?”' 15 He will show
you a large furnished upper room that is ready. Make the preparations for us there.”
16 The disciples left and went to the city. They found everything as he had said to
them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
17 When it was evening, he came with the twelve. 18 As they were lying down at the
table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, one of you eating with me will betray
me.” 19 They were all very sorrowful, and one by one they said to him, “Surely not
I?” 20 Jesus answered and said to them, “It is one of the twelve, the one now dipping
bread with me in the bowl. 21 For the Son of Man will go the way that the scripture
says about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It
would have been better for him if he had not been born.”
22 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, and broke it. He gave it to them
and said, “Take this. This is my body.” 23 He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it
to them, and they all drank from it. 24 He said to them, “This is my blood of the
covenant, the blood that is poured out for many. 25 Truly I say to you, I will not drink
again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of
God.”
26 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 27 Jesus said
to them, “All of you will fall away, for it is written,
'I will strike the shepherd
and the sheep will be scattered.'
28 But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 29 Peter said to him,
“Even if all fall away, I will not.” 30 Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, today—yes,
this very night—before the rooster crows twice you will deny me three times.” 31 But
Peter said, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all made the same
promise.
32 They came to the place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit
here while I pray.” 33 He took Peter, James, and John with him and began to be
distressed and deeply troubled. 34 He said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even
to the point of death. Remain here and watch.” 35 Going a little farther, Jesus fell to
the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him. 36 He
said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible with you. Remove this cup from me. But
not my will, but yours.” 37 He came back and found them sleeping, and he said to
Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch for one hour? 38 Watch and pray
that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.” 39 Again he went away and prayed, and he used the same words. 40 When
he came back again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. They didMark 14:41
1070
Mark 14:72
not know what to say to him. 41 He came the third time and said to them, “Are you
still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come. Look! The Son
of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42 Get up; let us go. Look, the
one who is betraying me is near.” 43 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the
twelve, arrived, and a large crowd was with him with swords and clubs, from the
chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 44 Now his betrayer had given them a sign,
saying, “Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him and lead him away under guard.”
45 When Judas arrived, immediately he came up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi,” and he
kissed him. 46 Then they laid hands on him and seized him. 47 But one of them who
stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
48 Jesus said to them, “Do you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to
capture me? 49 When I was daily with you and I was teaching in the temple, you did
not arrest me. But this was done that the scriptures might be fulfilled.” 50 All those
with Jesus left him and ran away.
51 A young man, wearing only a linen garment that was wrapped around him, was
following Jesus. When the men seized him 52 he left the linen garment and ran away
naked.
53 They led Jesus to the high priest. There were gathered with him all the chief
priests, the elders, and the scribes. 54 Now Peter followed him from a distance, as far
as the courtyard of the high priest. He sat among the guards, who were near a fire
to keep warm. 55 Now the chief priests and the entire Jewish council were seeking
testimony against Jesus so they might put him to death. But they did not find any.
56 For many brought false testimony against him, but even their testimony did not
agree. 57 Some stood up and brought false testimony against him; they said, 58 “We
heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will
build another made without hands.'” 59 Yet even their testimony did not agree. 60 The
high priest stood up among them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is
it these men testify against you?” 61 But he was silent and answered nothing. Again
the high priest questioned him and said, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”
62 Jesus said, “I am;
and you will see the Son of Man
when he sits at the right hand of power
and comes with the clouds of heaven.”
63 The high priest tore his garments and said, “Do we still need witnesses? 64 You
have heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?” They all condemned him as one
who deserved death. 65 Some began to spit on him and to cover his face and strike
him and say to him, “Prophesy!” The officers took him and beat him.
66 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high
priest came to him. 67 She saw Peter warming himself, and she looked closely at him
and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus.” 68 But he denied it, saying, “I
neither know nor understand what you are talking about.” Then he went out into
the courtyard. * 69 But the servant girl there saw him and began to say again to those
who stood there, “This man is one of them!” 70 But he denied it again. After a little
while those who stood there were saying to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for
you also are a Galilean.” 71 But he began to put himself under curses and to swear, “I
do not know this man you are talking about.” 72 The rooster immediately crowed a
second time. Then Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him: “Before
the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times,” and he broke down and wept.
* 14:68 Some ancient copies add, “Then the rooster crowed,” but the best ancient copies do not have this phrase.Mark 15:1
1071
Mark 15:39

1 Early in the morning, the chief priests met together with the elders and scribes
and the entire Jewish council. Then they bound Jesus and led him away. They handed
him over to Pilate. 2 Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered
him, “You say so.” 3 The chief priests were presenting many charges against Jesus.
4 Pilate again asked him, “Do you give no answer? See how many charges they are
bringing against you!” 5 But Jesus no longer answered Pilate, and that amazed him.
6 Now at the time of the feast, Pilate usually released to them one prisoner, a
prisoner they requested. 7 There with the rebels in prison, among the murderers
held for their part in the rebellion, was a man named Barabbas. 8 The crowd came
to Pilate and began to ask him to do for them as he had done in the past. 9 Pilate
answered them and said, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
10 For he knew that it was because of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over
to him. 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to cry out that Barabbas should
be released instead. 12 Pilate answered them again and said, “What then should I do
with the King of the Jews?” 13 They shouted again, “Crucify him!” 14 Pilate said to
them, “What wrong has he done?” But they shouted more and more, “Crucify him.”
15 Pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd, so he released Barabbas to them. He scourged
Jesus and then handed him over to be crucified.
16 The soldiers led him inside the courtyard (which is the government headquar-
ters), and they called together the whole cohort of soldiers. 17 They put a purple robe
on Jesus, and they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on him. 18 They
began to salute him and say, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 19 They struck his head with
a reed staff and they spat on him. They bent their knees before him to pretend to
worship him. 20 When they had mocked him, they took off of him the purple robe and
put his own garments on him, and then led him out to crucify him. 21 A certain man,
Simon of Cyrene, was coming in from the country (he was the father of Alexander
and Rufus), and they forced him to carry his cross.
22 The soldiers brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which interpreted means,
“Place of a Skull”). 23 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not drink
it. 24 They crucified him and divided up his garments by casting lots to determine
what piece each soldier would take. 25 It was the third hour when they crucified him.
26 On a sign they wrote the charge against him, “The king of the Jews.” 27 With him
they crucified two robbers, one on the right of him and one on his left. 28 * 29 Those
who passed by insulted him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would
destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 30 save yourself and come down from
the cross!” 31 In the same way the chief priests were mocking him with each other,
along with the scribes, and said, “He saved others, but he cannot save himself. 32 Let
the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and
believe,” and those who were crucified with him also taunted him.
33 At the sixth hour, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. 34 At
the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which
is interpreted, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” 35 Some of those
standing by heard his words and said, “Look, he is calling for Elijah.” 36 Someone
ran, put sour wine on a sponge, put it on a reed staff, and gave it to him to drink.
The man said, “Let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.” 37 Then Jesus cried
out with a loud voice and died. 38 The curtain of the temple was split in two from
the top to the bottom. 39 When the centurion who stood and faced Jesus saw that he
* 15:28 The best ancient copies omit Mrk. 15:28, The scripture was fulfilled that says, 'He was counted with the
lawless ones,' (compare LUK 22:37) .Mark 15:40
1072
Mark 16:18
had died in this way, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” 40 There were
also women who looked on from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene,
Mary (the mother of James the younger and of Joses), and Salome. 41 When he was
in Galilee they followed him and served him. Many other women also came up with
him to Jerusalem.
42 When evening had come, because it was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day
before the Sabbath, 43 Joseph of Arimathea came there. He was a respected member
of the council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God. He boldly went in to Pilate
and asked for the body of Jesus. 44 Pilate was amazed that Jesus was already dead; he
called the centurion and asked him if Jesus was dead. 45 When Pilate learned from
the centurion that Jesus was dead, he gave the body to Joseph. 46 Joseph had bought
a linen cloth. He took him down from the cross, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and
laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of a rock. Then he rolled a stone against
the entrance of the tomb. 47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw the
place where Jesus was buried.
16
1 When the Sabbath day was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and
Salome bought spices that they might come and anoint Jesus' body. 2 Very early on
the first day of the week, they went to the tomb when the sun came up. 3 They were
saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the
tomb?” 4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, for it
was very large. 5 They entered the tomb and saw a young man dressed in a white
robe, sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 6 He said to them, “Do not
be alarmed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not
here. Look at the place where they had laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter,
'He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'”
8 They went out and ran from the tomb; they were trembling and amazed. They
said nothing to anyone because they were so afraid. 9 * Early on the first day of the
week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast
out seven demons. 10 She went and told those who were with him, while they were
mourning and weeping. 11 They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen
by her, but they did not believe.
12 † After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were
walking out into the country. 13 They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they
did not believe them.
14 ‡ Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he
rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe
those who saw him after he rose from the dead. 15 He said to them, “Go into all
the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. 16 He who believes and is
baptized will be saved, and he who does not believe will be condemned. 17 § These
signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They
will speak in new languages. 18 They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they
drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they
will get well.”

1 Many have taken on the work of putting together an account of the things that
have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were passed down to us by those who
from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 So it seemed good to me
also, because I have accurately investigated everything from the beginning, to write
an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you might know the
certainty of the things you have been taught.
5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah,
from the division of Abijah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name
was Elizabeth. 6 They were both righteous before God, obeying all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord. 7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren,
and they were both very old by this time.
8 Now it came about that Zechariah was in God's presence, carrying out the priestly
duties in the order of his division. 9 According to the customary way of choosing
which priest would serve, he had been chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the
Lord to burn incense. 10 The whole crowd of people was praying outside at the hour
when the incense was burned. 11 Now an angel of the Lord appeared to him and stood
at the right side of the incense altar. 12 When Zechariah saw him, he was terrified and
fear fell on him. 13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because
your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son. You will call
his name John. 14 You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong
drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb. 16 Many of
the people of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God. 17 He will go before the face
of the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready for the
Lord a people prepared for him.”
18 Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this? For I am an old man and
my wife is very old.” 19 The angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who
stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, to bring you this good
news. 20 Behold! You will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take
place. This is because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the
right time.” 21 Now the people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised that
he was spending so much time in the temple. 22 But when he came out, he could not
speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision while he was in the temple.
He kept on making signs to them and remained silent. 23 It came about that when
the days of his service were over, he went to his house.
24 After these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived and for five months she kept herself
hidden. She said, 25 “This is what the Lord has done for me when he looked at me
with favor in order to take away my shame before people.”
26 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee named
Nazareth, 27 to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph. He belonged to
the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. 28 He came to her and said,
“Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.” 29 But she was very
confused by his words and she wondered what kind of greeting this could be. 30 The
angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 See,
you will conceive in your womb and bear a son. You will call his name 'Jesus.' 32 HeLuke 1:33
1075
Luke 1:67
will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him
the throne of his ancestor David. 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
and there will be no end to his kingdom.” 34 Mary said to the angel, “How will this
happen, since I have not slept with any man?” 35 The angel answered and said to her,
“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will come over
you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. 36 See, your relative
Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month for her, she
who was called barren. 37 For nothing will be impossible for God.” 38 Mary said, “See,
I am the female servant of the Lord. Let it be for me according to your message.”
Then the angel left her.
39 Then Mary arose in those days and quickly went into the hill country, to a city
in Judea. 40 She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 41 Now it
happened that when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby in her womb jumped,
and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 She raised her voice and said loudly,
“Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. 43 Why has
it happened to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44 For see, when
the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.
45 Blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that
were told her from the Lord.” 46 Mary said,
“My soul praises the Lord,
47 and my spirit has rejoiced in God my savior.
48 For he has looked at the low condition of his female servant.
For see, from now on all generations will call me blessed.
49 For he who is mighty has done great things for me,
and his name is holy.
50 His mercy lasts from generation to generation for those who fear him.
51 He has displayed strength with his arm;
he has scattered those who were proud about the thoughts of their hearts.
52 He has thrown down princes from their thrones
and he has raised up those of low condition.
53 He has filled the hungry with good things,
but the rich he has sent away empty.
54 He has given help to Israel his servant,
so as to remember to show mercy
55 (as he said to our fathers) to Abraham and his descendants forever.”
56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her house.
57 Now the time had come for Elizabeth to deliver her baby and she gave birth to
a son. 58 Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great
mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
59 Now it happened on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child. They
would have called him “Zechariah,” after the name of his father. 60 But his mother
answered and said, “No. He will be called John.” 61 They said to her, “There is no one
among your relatives who is called by this name.” 62 They made signs to his father as
to how he wanted him to be named. 63 His father asked for a writing tablet and wrote,
“His name is John.” They all were astonished at this. 64 Immediately his mouth was
opened and his tongue was freed. He spoke and praised God. 65 Fear came on all who
lived around them. All these matters were spread throughout all the hill country of
Judea. 66 All who heard them stored them in their hearts, saying, “What then will
this child become?” For the hand of the Lord was with him.
67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,Luke 1:68
1076
Luke 2:16
68 “Praised be the Lord, the God of Israel,
for he has come to help and he has accomplished redemption for his people.
69 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
in the house of his servant David
70 (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago),
71 salvation from our enemies
and from the hand of all who hate us.
72 He will do this to show mercy to our fathers
and to remember his holy covenant,
73 the oath that he spoke to Abraham our father.
74 He swore to grant to us that we, having been delivered out of the hand of our
enemies,
would serve him without fear,
75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
76 Yes, and you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,
for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his paths,
to prepare people for his coming,
77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people
by the forgiveness of their sins.
78 This will happen because of the tender mercy of our God,
because of which the sunrise from on high will come to help us,
79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.
He will do this to guide our feet into the path of peace.”
80 Now the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness
until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

1 Now in those days, it came about that Caesar Augustus sent out a decree ordering
that a census be taken of all the people living in the world. 2 This was the first census
made while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 So everyone went to his own city to
be registered for the census. 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of
Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was
of the house and family line of David. 5 He went there to register along with Mary,
who was engaged to him and was pregnant. 6 Now it came about that while they
were there, the time came for her to deliver her baby. 7 She gave birth to a son, her
firstborn child, and she wrapped him in long strips of cloth and laid him in a manger,
because there was no room for them in the inn.
8 There were shepherds in that region who were staying in the fields, guarding their
flock at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord
shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. 10 Then the angel said to
them, “Do not be afraid, because I bring you the good news that will bring great joy
to all the people. 11 Today a savior was born for you in the city of David! He is Christ
the Lord! 12 This is the sign that will be given to you: You will find a baby wrapped in
strips of cloth and lying in a manger.” 13 Suddenly there was together with the angel
a great, heavenly army praising God and saying,
14 “Glory to God in the highest,
and may there be peace on earth among people
with whom he is pleased.”
15 It came about that when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the
shepherds said to each other, “Let us now go to Bethlehem, and see this thing that
has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 16 They hurried there andLuke 2:17
1077
Luke 2:46
found Mary and Joseph, and saw the baby lying in the manger. 17 After they had
seen him, they made known what had been said to them about this child. 18 All who
heard it were amazed at what was spoken to them by the shepherds. 19 But Mary
kept thinking about all the things she had heard, treasuring them in her heart. 20 The
shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for everything that they had heard
and seen, just as it had been spoken to them.
21 When it was the end of the eighth day, when he was circumcised, he was named
Jesus, the name he had been given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
22 When the required number of days for their purification had passed, according
to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary * brought him up to the temple in Jerusalem
to present him to the Lord. 23 As it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male
who opens the womb will be set apart to the Lord.” 24 So they offered a sacrifice
according to what was said in the law of the Lord, “a pair of doves or two young
pigeons.” 25 Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and
this man was righteous and devout. He was looking for the consolation of Israel, and
the Holy Spirit was upon him. 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that
he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. 27 Led by the Spirit,
Simeon came into the temple. When the parents brought in the infant Jesus, to do
for him according to the custom of the law, 28 he took him into his arms and praised
God and he said,
29 “Now let your servant depart in peace, Lord, according to your word.
30 For my eyes have seen your salvation,
31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:
32 A light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to your people Israel.”
33 His father and mother † were amazed at what was said about him. 34 Simeon
blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the
downfall and rising up of many people in Israel and for a sign that is rejected—
35 and a sword will pierce your own soul—so that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed.” 36 A prophetess named Anna was there. She was the daughter of Phanuel
from the tribe of Asher. She was very old. She had lived with her husband for seven
years after her virginity, 37 and was a widow for eighty-four years. She never left the
temple but was serving with fastings and prayers, night and day. 38 At that very hour
she came near to them and began giving thanks to God and she spoke about the child
to everyone who had been waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. 39 When they
had finished everything they were required to do according to the law of the Lord,
they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
40 The child grew and became strong, increasing in wisdom, and the grace of God
was upon him.
41 His parents went every year to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. 42 When
he was twelve years old, they again went up at the customary time for the feast.
43 After they had stayed the full number of days for the feast, they began to return
home. But the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know
it. 44 They assumed that he was with the group that was traveling with them, so they
traveled a day's journey. Then they started looking for him among their relatives
and friends. 45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem and started
looking for him there. 46 It came about that after three days, they found him in

Luke 3:17
the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, listening to them and asking them
questions. 47 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
48 When they saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have
you treated us this way? Listen, your father and I have been anxiously searching for
you.” 49 He said to them, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that
I had to be about my Father's business? ‡ 50 But they did not understand what he
meant by those words. 51 Then he went back home with them to Nazareth and was
obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.
52 But Jesus continued to grow in wisdom and stature, and increased in favor with
God and people.

1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—while Pontius Pilate was
governor of Judea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetrarch of
the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, 2 during
the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas—the word of God came to John son
of Zechariah in the wilderness. 3 He went into all the region around the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 4 As it is written in the
book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
“A voice of one calling out in the wilderness,
'Make ready the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.
5 Every valley will be filled,
and every mountain and hill will be made low,
and the crooked roads will be made straight,
and the uneven places will be built into roads,
6 and all flesh will see the salvation of God.'”
7 So John said to the crowds who were coming out to be baptized by him, “You
offspring of vipers! Who warned you to run away from the wrath that is coming?
8 Therefore, produce fruits that are worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say
within yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to
raise up children for Abraham from these stones. 9 Even now the ax is set against the
root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and
thrown into the fire.” 10 Then the crowds kept asking him, saying, “What then are
we to do?” 11 He answered and said to them, “If someone has two tunics, he should
share it with a person who has none, and the one having food should do the same.”
12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must
we do?” 13 He said to them, “Do not collect more money than you have been ordered
to collect.” 14 Some soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we
do?” He said to them, “Do not take money from anyone by force, and do not accuse
anyone falsely. Be content with your wages.”
15 Now as the people were eagerly expecting the Christ to come, everyone was
wondering in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ. 16 John
answered by saying to them all, “As for me, I baptize you with water, but someone is
coming who is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy even to untie the strap of
his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 17 His winnowing
fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather the wheat
into his storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with fire that can never be put
out.”
‡ 2:49 Some scholars translate “about my Father's business” as in my Father's house .Luke 3:18
1079
Luke 4:13
18 With many other exhortations also, John preached good news to the people.
19 When
Herod the tetrarch had been reproved for marrying his brother's wife
Herodias, and for all the other evil things that Herod had done, 20 he added this
to them all, that he locked John up in prison.
21 Now it came about, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized,
and while he was praying, the heavens opened, 22 and the Holy Spirit in bodily form
came down on him like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son,
whom I love. I am pleased with you.”
23 When Jesus began his ministry, he was about thirty years of age. He was the
son (as it was assumed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, 24 the son of Matthat, the son of
Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph. 25 Joseph was the son
of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the
son of Joda. 27 Joda was the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel,
the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri, 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of
Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the
son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi. 30 Levi was the son of Simeon, the
son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 31 the son of
Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of
Nahshon. 33 Nahshon was the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni,
the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 34 the son of Jacob, the son of
Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 35 the son of Serug, the
son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah. 36 Shelah was the son
of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel,
the son of Cainan, 38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

1 Then Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River, and was
led by the Spirit in the wilderness, 2 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil.
He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of that time he was hungry. 3 The
devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”
4 Jesus answered him, “It is written, 'Man does not live on bread alone.'” 5 Then the
devil led Jesus up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant of time.
6 The devil said to him, “I will give to you all this authority and all their splendor, for
they have been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want. 7 So then, if you will
bow down and worship me, it will be yours.” 8 But Jesus answered and said to him,
“It is written, 'You will worship the Lord your God, and you will serve only him.'”
9 Then the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on the very highest point of the
temple building, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down
from here. 10 For it is written,
'He will give orders to his angels regarding you, to protect you,'
11 and, 'They will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'”
12 Answering him, Jesus said, “It is said, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'”
13 When the devil had finished testing Jesus, he went away and left him until
another time.Luke 4:14
1080
Luke 4:41
14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him
spread throughout the entire surrounding region. 15 Then he began to teach in their
synagogues and he was praised by all.
16 He came into Nazareth, where he had been raised, and as was his custom, he
entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up to read aloud. 17 The
scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the scroll and found the
place where it was written,
18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he anointed me to tell good news to the poor.
He has sent me to proclaim freedom to the captives,
and recovery of sight to the blind,
to set free those who are oppressed,
19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.”
20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The
eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 He began to speak to them, “Today
this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” 22 Everyone there spoke well of him
and they were amazed at the gracious words which were coming out of his mouth,
and they asked, “Is this not the son of Joseph?” 23 He said to them, “Surely you will
say this proverb to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself. Whatever we heard that you did in
Capernaum, do the same in your hometown.'” 24 But he said, “Truly I say to you,
no prophet is received in his own hometown. 25 But in truth I tell you that there
were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for
three years and six months, and a great famine came upon all the land. 26 But Elijah
was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath in Sidon, to a widow living there.
27 There were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, but none
of them were healed except Naaman the Syrian.” 28 All the people in the synagogue
were filled with rage when they heard these things. 29 They got up, forced him out of
the town, and led him to the cliff of the hill on which their town was built, so they
might throw him off the cliff. 30 But he passed through the middle of them and he
went to another place.
31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and he began to teach them
on the Sabbath. 32 They were astonished at his teaching, because he spoke with
authority. 33 Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean
demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 34 “Ah! What do we have to do with you,
Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy
One of God!” 35 Jesus rebuked the demon, saying, “Do not speak! Come out of him!”
When the demon had thrown the man down in the middle of them, he came out of
him, and did not harm him in any way. 36 All the people were very amazed, and they
kept talking about it with one another. They said, “What kind of words are these? He
commands the unclean spirits with authority and power and they come out.” 37 So
news about him began to spread into every part of the surrounding region.
38 Then Jesus left the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon. Now Simon's
mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they pleaded with him on her
behalf. 39 So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately
she got up and started serving them.
40 When the sun was setting, people brought to Jesus everyone who was sick with
various kinds of diseases. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
41 Demons also came out from many of them, crying out and saying, “You are the
Son of God!” Jesus rebuked the demons and would not let them speak, because they
knew that he was the Christ.Luke 4:42
1081
Luke 5:25
42 When daybreak came, he went out into a solitary place. Crowds of people were
looking for him and came to the place where he was. They tried to keep him from
going away from them. 43 But he said to them, “I must also preach the good news
about the kingdom of God to many other cities, because this is the reason I was sent
here.”
44 Then he continued to preach in the synagogues throughout Judea.

1 Now it happened, while the people were crowding around Jesus and listening to
the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. 2 He saw two boats
pulled up by the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gotten out of them and were
washing their nets. 3 Jesus got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked
him to put it out in the water a short distance from the land. Then he sat down
and taught the people out of the boat. 4 When he had finished speaking, he said to
Simon, “Take the boat out into the deeper water and let down your nets for a catch.”
5 Simon answered and said, “Master, we worked all night, and caught nothing, but
at your word, I will let down the nets.” 6 When they had done this, they gathered a
very large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. 7 So they motioned to their
partners in the other boat that they should come and help them. They came and filled
both the boats, so that they began to sink. 8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down
at Jesus' knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.” 9 For he was
amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken. 10 This
included James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said
to Simon, “Do not be afraid, because from now on you will catch men.” 11 When they
had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
12 It came about that while he was in one of the cities, a man full of leprosy was
there. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you are
willing, you can make me clean.” 13 Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him,
saying, “I am willing. Be clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him. 14 He instructed
him to tell no one, but told him, “Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest
and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them.” 15 But the report about him spread even farther, and large crowds
of people came together to hear him teach and to be healed of their sicknesses. 16 But
he often withdrew into the deserted places and prayed.
17 It came about on one of those days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees
and teachers of the law sitting there who had come from many different villages in
the regions of Galilee and Judea, and also from the town of Jerusalem. The power of
the Lord was with him to heal. 18 Now some men came, carrying on a mat a man
that was paralyzed, and they looked for a way to bring him inside in order to lay
him down in front of Jesus. 19 They could not find a way to bring him in because of
the crowd, so they went up to the housetop and let the man down through the tiles,
on his mat, into the midst of the people, right in front of Jesus. 20 Seeing their faith,
Jesus said, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.” 21 The scribes and the Pharisees began
to question this, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins
but God alone?” 22 But Jesus, perceiving what they were thinking, answered and said
to them, “Why are you questioning this in your hearts? 23 Which is easier to say,
'Your sins are forgiven you' or to say 'Get up and walk?' 24 But that you may know
that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralysed
man—”I tell you, get up, pick up your mat and go to your house.” 25 Immediately he
got up in front of them and picked up the mat on which he was lying. Then he wentLuke 5:26
1082
Luke 6:15
away to his house, glorifying God. 26 Everyone was amazed and they glorified God.
They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”
27 After these things happened, Jesus went out from there and saw a tax collector
named Levi sitting at the tax collector's tent. He said to him, “Follow me.” 28 So Levi
got up and followed him, leaving everything behind.
29 Then Levi gave a big banquet in his house for Jesus. There were many tax
collectors there and other people who were reclining at the table and eating with
them. 30 But the Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples, saying,
“Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other sinful people?” 31 Jesus
answered them, “People who are well do not need a physician; only those who are
sick. 32 I did not come to call righteous people to repentance, but to call sinners to
repentance.”
33 They said to him, “The disciples of John often fast and pray, and the disciples
of the Pharisees do the same. But your disciples eat and drink.” 34 Jesus said to
them, “Can anyone make the wedding attendants of the bridegroom fast while the
bridegroom is still with them? 35 But the days will come when the bridegroom will
be taken away from them, then in those days they will fast.” 36 Then Jesus also spoke
a parable to them. “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to
mend an old garment. If he did that, he would tear the new garment, and the piece
of cloth from the new garment would not fit with the cloth of the old garment. 37 No
one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does that, the new wine would burst the
skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed. 38 But
new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. 39 No one after drinking old wine wants
the new, for he says, 'The old is better.'”

1 Now it happened on a Sabbath that Jesus was going through the grainfields, and
his disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them between their hands, and
eating the grain. 2 But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing something
that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?” 3 Answering them, Jesus said, “Have
you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and the men who were
with him? 4 He went into the house of God, and took the bread of the presence and
ate some of it, and also gave some to the men who were with him to eat, even though
it was only lawful for the priests to eat it.” 5 Then he said to them, “The Son of Man
is Lord of the Sabbath.”
6 It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and taught the
people there. A man was there whose right hand was withered. 7 The scribes and
the Pharisees were watching him closely to see whether he would heal someone on
the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him. 8 But he knew what they
were thinking and he said to the man whose hand was withered, “Get up, and stand
here in the middle of everyone.” So the man got up and stood there. 9 Jesus said to
them, “I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life
or to destroy it?” 10 Then he looked around at them all and said to the man, “Stretch
out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was restored. 11 But they were filled with
anger and they talked to each other about what they might do to Jesus.
12 It happened in those days that he went out to the mountain to pray. He continued
all night in prayer to God. 13 When it was day, he called his disciples to him, and he
chose twelve of them, whom he also named apostles. 14 The names of the apostles
were Simon (whom he also named Peter) and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip,
Bartholomew, 15 Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called theLuke 6:16
1083
Luke 6:45
Zealot, 16 Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 17 Then Jesus
came down the mountain with them and stood on a level place with a large crowd
of his disciples and a large number of the people from Judea and Jerusalem and
the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. 18 They had come to listen to him and to be healed
of their diseases. People who were troubled with unclean spirits were also healed.
19 Everyone in the crowd kept trying to touch him because power to heal was coming
out from him, and he healed them all.
20 Then he looked at his disciples, and said, “Blessed are you who are poor, for
yours is the kingdom of God. 21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be
filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. 22 Blessed are you when
people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as
evil, because of the Son of Man. 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because you
will surely have a great reward in heaven, for their ancestors treated the prophets
in the same way. 24 But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your
comfort. 25 Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry later. Woe to you
who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep later. 26 Woe to you when all men
speak well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.
27 But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies and do good to those who
hate you. 28 Bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you. 29 To
him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer him also the other. If someone takes
away your coat, do not withhold your tunic either. 30 Give to everyone who asks you.
If someone takes away something that belongs to you, do not ask him to give it back
to you. 31 As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them. 32 If
you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love
those who love them. 33 If you do good only to people who do good to you, what
credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. 34 If you only lend to people
from whom you expect to be repaid, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to
sinners, to get back the same amount. 35 But love your enemies and do good to them.
Lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be
sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind toward unthankful and evil people. 36 Be
merciful, just as your Father is merciful. 37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive others, and you will be
forgiven. 38 Give, and it will be given to you. A generous amount—pressed down,
shaken together and spilling over—will pour into your lap. For with the measure you
use, it will be measured back to you.”
39 Then he also told them a parable.
“Can a blind person guide another blind
person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not? 40 A disciple is
not greater than his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his
teacher. 41 Why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye,
but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye? 42 How can you say to your
brother, 'Brother, let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' when you
yourself do not even see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take
the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of
straw that is in your brother's eye. 43 For there is no good tree that produces rotten
fruit, nor is there a rotten tree that produces good fruit. 44 For each tree is known
by the kind of fruit it produces. For people do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor
do they gather grapes from a briar bush. 45 The good man from the good treasure of
his heart produces what is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart
produces what is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.Luke 6:46
1084
Luke 7:23
46 Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say?
47 Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell
you what he is like. 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in
the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. When a flood came, the
torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had
been well built. 49 But the person who hears my words and does not obey them, he is
like a man who built a house on top of the ground without a foundation. When the
torrent of water flowed against that house, it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of
that house was complete.”
7
1 After Jesus had finished everything he was saying in the hearing of the people, he
entered Capernaum.
2 Now a centurion had a slave who was highly regarded by him, and he was sick
and about to die. 3 When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders
of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. 4 When they had come to
Jesus, they asked him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy to have you do this for him,
5 because he loves our nation, and he is the one who built the synagogue for us.” 6 So
Jesus continued on his way with them. But when he was not far from the house, the
centurion sent friends to say to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, because I am
not worthy for you to come under my roof. 7 For this reason I did not even consider
myself worthy to come to you, but just say a word and my servant will be healed. 8 For
I also am a man who is under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,'
and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,'
and he does it.” 9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the
crowd following him said, “I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”
10 When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant was
well.
11 Soon after that, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great
crowd went with him. 12 As he came near to the gate of the town, behold, a man
who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother (who was a widow),
and a rather large crowd from the town was with her. 13 When the Lord saw her, he
was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, “Do not cry.” 14 Then he
went up and touched the wooden frame on which they carried the body, and those
carrying it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, arise.” 15 The dead man
sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16 Then fear overcame
all of them, and they kept praising God, saying, “A great prophet has been raised
among us” and “God has looked upon his people.” 17 This news about Jesus spread
throughout the whole of Judea and all the neighboring regions.
18 John's disciples told him about all these things. 19 Then John called two of his
disciples and sent them to the Lord to say, “Are you the one who is to come, or
should we look for another?” 20 When they had come near to Jesus, the men said,
“John the Baptist has sent us to you to say, 'Are you the one who is coming, or should
we look for another?'” 21 In that hour he healed many people from sicknesses and
afflictions and from evil spirits, and to many blind people he gave sight. 22 Jesus
answered and said to them, “After you have gone on your way, report to John what
you have seen and heard. Blind people are receiving sight, lame people are walking,
lepers are being cleansed, deaf people are hearing, people who have died are being
raised back to life, and needy people are being told the good news. 23 The person
who does not stop believing in me because of my actions is blessed.”Luke 7:24
1085
Luke 8:2
24 After John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about
John, “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 25 But
what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Look, those who wear
expensive clothing and who live in luxury are in kings' palaces. 26 But what did you
go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 27 This is he of
whom it is written,
'See, I am sending my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way before you.'
28 I say to you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who
is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.” 29 (When all the people heard
this, including the tax collectors, they declared that God is righteous, because they
had been baptized with the baptism of John. 30 But the Pharisees and the experts in
Jewish law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized
by John.) 31 “To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are
they like? 32 They are like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to
one another and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a
funeral song, and you did not cry.' 33 For John the Baptist came eating no bread and
drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' 34 The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax
collectors and sinners!' 35 But wisdom is justified by all her children.”
36 Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. So after Jesus entered into
the Pharisee's house, he reclined at the table to eat. 37 Behold, there was a woman
in the city who was a sinner. When she found out that he was reclining at the table
in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil. 38 As she stood
behind him near his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she
wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with
perfumed oil. 39 When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he thought to
himself, saying, “If this man were a prophet, then he would know who and what
type of woman is touching him, that she is a sinner.” 40 Jesus responded and said to
him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” He said, “Say it, Teacher!” 41 Jesus said,
“A certain moneylender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and
the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay him, he forgave them both. Therefore,
which of them will love him more?” 43 Simon answered him and said, “I suppose
the one whom he forgave the most.” Jesus said to him, “You have judged correctly.”
44 Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon, “You see this woman. I have entered
into your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with
her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45 You did not give me a kiss, but from the
time I came in she did not stop kissing my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil. 47 Therefore I say to you, her
sins, which were many, have been forgiven—for she loved much. But the one who is
forgiven little, loves little.” 48 Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 49 Those
reclining together began to say among themselves, “Who is this that even forgives
sins?” 50 Then Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”
8
1 It happened soon afterward that Jesus began traveling around to different cities
and villages, preaching and proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God.
The twelve were with him, 2 as well as certain women who had been healed of evil
spirits and diseases: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons hadLuke 8:3
1086
Luke 8:29
been driven out; 3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's manager; Susanna; and many
others, who, out of their possessions, provided for their needs.
4 While a large crowd of people was gathering, and people were coming to him
from town after town, he told a parable: 5 “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As
he sowed, some fell beside the road and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of
the sky devoured it. 6 Some fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew up, it withered
away, because it had no moisture. 7 Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up
together with the seed and choked it. 8 But some fell on good soil and produced a
crop that was a hundred times greater.” After Jesus had said these things, he called
out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”
9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 10 He said, “The knowledge of
the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but for others I speak in
parables, so that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'
11 Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. 12 The ones
along the path are those who have heard, but then the devil comes and takes away
the word from their hearts, so they may not believe and be saved. 13 The ones on the
rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But they have no
root; they believe for a while, and in a time of testing they fall away. 14 The seeds
that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word, but as they go on their way,
they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does
not mature. 15 But the seed that fell on the good soil, these are the ones who, hearing
the word with an honest and good heart, hold it securely and bear fruit with patient
endurance.
16 No one lights a lamp and covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. Rather, he
puts it on a lampstand so that everyone who enters may see the light. 17 For nothing
is hidden that will not be made known, nor is anything secret that will not be known
and come into the light. 18 So listen carefully, for to the one who has, more will be
given to him, but the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be
taken away from him.”
19 Then his mother and brothers came to him, but they could not get near him
because of the crowd. 20 He was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing
outside, wanting to see you.” 21 But Jesus answered and said to them, “My mother
and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”
22 Now one day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go
over to the other side of the lake.” They set sail. 23 But as they sailed he fell asleep.
A terrible windstorm came down on the lake, and their boat was filling with water,
and they were in danger. 24 Then Jesus' disciples came over to him and woke him
up, saying, “Master! Master! We are about to die!” He awoke and rebuked the wind
and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm. 25 Then he said
to them, “Where is your faith?” and they were afraid. While they were afraid they
were also amazed, and they asked one another, “Who then is this, that he commands
even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”
26 They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.
27 When Jesus stepped on the land, he was met by a certain man from the city who
had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house
but among the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him
and he said with a loud voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most
High God? I beg you, do not torment me.” 29 For Jesus had commanded the unclean
spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and though he was
bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, he had broken his chainsLuke 8:30
1087
Luke 9:4
and he would be driven by the demon into the wilderness. 30 Then Jesus asked him,
“What is your name?” and he said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
31 They kept begging him not to send them into the abyss. 32 Now a large herd of pigs
was there feeding on the hillside. The demons begged him to let them go into them,
and he gave them permission. 33 So the demons came out of the man and went into
the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.
34 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and told about
it in the city and countryside. 35 So the people went out to see what had happened,
and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. He
was sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
36 Then those who had seen it told them how the man who had been possessed by
demons had been healed. 37 Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked
Jesus to depart from them, for they were overwhelmed with great fear. So he got into
the boat so they could start back. 38 The man from whom the demons had gone out
begged him to let him go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, 39 “Return to
your home and give a full account of what God has done for you.” The man went on
his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting
him. 41 Behold, a man named Jairus, who was one of the leaders of the synagogue,
came and fell down at Jesus' feet, and he begged him to come to his house, 42 because
his only daughter, a girl of about twelve years of age, was dying. As Jesus was on his
way, the crowds of people pressed together around him.
43 Now a woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years and had spent
all her money * , and could not be healed by anyone. 44 She came behind Jesus and
touched the edge of his coat, and immediately her bleeding stopped. 45 Jesus said,
“Who was it who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds
of people are all around you and they are pressing in against you.” 46 But Jesus said,
“Someone did touch me, for I know that power has gone out from me.” 47 When
the woman saw that she could not escape notice, she came trembling and fell down
before him. In the presence of all the people she declared why she had touched him
and how she had been immediately healed. 48 Then he said to her, “Daughter, your
faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's house,
saying, “Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher any longer.” 50 But when
Jesus heard this, he answered Jairus, “Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be
healed.” 51 When he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except
Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and her mother. 52 Now all
were mourning and wailing for her, but he said, “Do not weep; she is not dead but
asleep.” 53 But they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 54 But he took her
by the hand and called out, saying, “Child, get up!” 55 Her spirit returned, and she
rose up immediately. He ordered them to get her something to eat. 56 Her parents
were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.
9
1 He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the
demons and to cure diseases. 2 He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and
to heal the sick. 3 He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey—no staff, no wallet,
no bread, no money, and no extra tunic. 4 Whatever house you enter, stay there until
* 8:43 Scholars are divided whether the phrase [she] had spent all her money should be included here.Luke 9:5
1088
Luke 9:35
you leave. 5 Wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off
the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.” 6 Then they departed and went
through the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.
7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was
perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, 8 and
others said that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long
ago had risen. 9 Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who is this about whom I hear such
things?” And so he tried to see him.
10 When the apostles returned, they told him everything they had done. Then he
took them with him, and they went away privately to a town called Bethsaida. 11 But
when the crowds heard about this, they followed him. He welcomed them and spoke
to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing. 12 Now
the day was about to come to an end, and the twelve came to him and said, “Send the
crowd away that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find
lodging and food, because we are here in an isolated place.” 13 But he said to them,
“You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves of
bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people.” 14 (There were
about five thousand men.) He said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups
of about fifty each.” 15 So they did this, and made the people sit down. 16 Taking the
five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, he blessed them and broke them
into pieces, and he gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. 17 They all ate
and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up—twelve baskets of broken
pieces.
18 It came about while Jesus was praying by himself, the disciples were with him.
He questioned them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” 19 They answered,
“John the Baptist. But others say Elijah, and others say that one of the prophets from
long ago has risen.” 20 Then he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter
answered, “The Christ of God.” 21 But he strongly warned them to tell this to no one,
22 saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders
and chief priests and scribes, and he will be killed and on the third day be raised.”
23 Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself
and take up his cross daily and follow me. 24 Whoever would save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. 25 What good is it for a person to
gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit himself? 26 Whoever is ashamed of me
and my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his own
glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 27 But I say to you truly,
there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom
of God.”
28 Now about eight days after Jesus said these words, he took with him Peter and
John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. 29 As he was praying, the form
of his face was changed, and his clothes became brilliant white. 30 Behold, two men
were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, 31 who appeared in glorious splendor. They
spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to completion in Jerusalem.
32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they
became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with
him. 33 As they were going away from Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for
us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) 34 As he was saying this, a cloud came
and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. 35 A
voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the one who is chosen; listenLuke 9:36
1089
Luke 10:6
to him.” 36 When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent and
told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
37 Now on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd
met him. 38 Behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to
look at my son, for he is my only child. 39 You see, a spirit takes control over him
and he suddenly screams; it causes him to have convulsions so that he foams at the
mouth. It hardly ever leaves him and it bruises him badly. 40 I begged your disciples
to force it out, but they could not.” 41 Jesus answered and said, “You unbelieving and
depraved generation, how long must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your
son here.” 42 While the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and
shook him with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy,
and gave him back to his father. 43 Then they were all amazed at the greatness of God.
While they all were marveling at everything he was doing, he said to his disciples,
44 “Let these words go deeply into your ears: The Son of Man will be betrayed into
the hands of men.” 45 But they did not understand this statement. It was hidden from
them, so they could not know its meaning, and yet they were afraid to ask about this
statement.
46 Then an argument started among them about which of them would be the
greatest. 47 But Jesus, knowing the reasoning in their hearts, took a little child and
put him by his side 48 and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name,
welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me. For
whoever is least among you all is the one who is great.”
49 John answered, “Master, we saw someone forcing out demons in your name and
we prevented him, because he does not follow along with us.” 50 “Do not stop him,”
Jesus said, “because whoever is not against you is for you.”
51 When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.
52 He sent messengers on ahead of him, and they went and entered into a Samaritan
village to prepare everything for him. 53 But the people there did not welcome him,
because he had set his face to go to Jerusalem. 54 When the disciples James and
John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from
heaven and destroy them?” 55 But he turned and rebuked them, 56 and they went on
to another village.
57 As they were going along the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you
wherever you go.” 58 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds in the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” 59 Then he said to another,
“Follow me.” But he said, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” 60 But he said
to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim far
and wide the kingdom of God.” 61 Then someone else said, “I will follow you, Lord,
but first let me say goodbye to those in my home.” 62 Jesus replied to him, “No one
who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”

1 Now after these things, the Lord appointed seventy * others, and sent them out
two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he himself was about to go.
2 He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore ask
the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. 3 Go on your way. See,
I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. 4 Do not carry a money bag, or a
traveler's bag, or sandals, and greet no one on the road. 5 Whatever house you enter,
first say, 'May peace be on this house!' 6 If a person of peace is there, your peace will
* 10:1 Many of the best ancient copies read “seventy” but some read “seventy-two”Luke 10:7
1090
Luke 10:37
rest upon him, but if not, it will return to you. 7 Remain in that same house, eating
and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not move
around from house to house. 8 Whatever town you enter, and they receive you, eat
what is set before you, 9 and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom
of God has come close to you.' 10 Whenever you enter a town and they do not receive
you, go out into its streets and say, 11 'Even the dust from your town that clings to our
feet we wipe off against you! But know this: The kingdom of God has come near.' 12 I
say to you that on the judgment day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that
town. 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works which
were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long
ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
at the judgment than for you. 15 You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted
to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. 16 The one who listens to you
listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me
rejects the one who sent me.”
17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submitted to us
in your name.” 18 Jesus said to them, “I was watching Satan fall from heaven as
lightning. 19 See, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and
over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will in any way hurt you. 20 Nevertheless
do not rejoice only in this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice even more that
your names are engraved in heaven.”
21 At that same time he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I praise
you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from
the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little
children. Yes, Father, for so it was well pleasing in your sight.” 22 “All things have
been entrusted to me from my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the
Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son
chooses to reveal him.” 23 Then he turned around to the disciples and said privately,
“Blessed are those who see the things that you see. 24 I say to you, many prophets
and kings desired to see the things you see, and they did not see them, and to hear
the things that you hear, and they did not hear them.”
25 Behold, a certain teacher of the Jewish laws stood up so that he might test him,
saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 26 Jesus said to him, “What is
written in the law? How do you read it?” 27 He gave an answer and he said, “You will
love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength,
and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” 28 Jesus said to him, “You
have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.” 29 But the teacher, desiring to
justify himself, said to Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?” 30 Jesus answered him and said,
“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell among robbers,
who stripped him of his belongings, and beat him, and left him half dead. 31 By chance
a certain priest was going down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the
other side. 32 Similarly a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed
by on the other side. 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he
was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion. 34 He approached him and
bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own animal,
and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two
denarii, and gave them to the host, and said, 'Take care of him and whatever extra
you spend, when I return, I will repay you.' 36 Which of these three do you think was
a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?” 37 The teacher said, “The one who
showed mercy to him.” Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”Luke 10:38
1091
Luke 11:23
38 Now as they were traveling along, he entered into a certain village, and a certain
woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. 39 She had a sister named
Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and heard his word. 40 But Martha was overly busy
with preparing to serve a meal. She came up to Jesus, and said, “Lord, do you not
care that my sister left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.” 41 But the
Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things,
42 but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen what is best, which will not be
taken away from her.”
11
1 It happened when Jesus was praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said
to him, “Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.” 2 Jesus said to them,
“When you pray say,
'Father, may your name be sanctified.
May your kingdom come.
3 Give us our daily bread each day.
4 Forgive us our sins,
as we forgive everyone
who is in debt to us.
Do not lead us into temptation.'”
5 Jesus said to them, “Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight,
and say to him, 'Friend, lend to me three loaves of bread, 6 since a friend of mine just
came in from the road, and I do not have anything to set before him'? 7 Then the
one inside who answered him may say, 'Do not bother me. The door is already shut,
and my children, along with me, are in bed. I am not able to get up and give bread
to you.' 8 I say to you, even if he does not get up and give bread to you because you
are his friend, yet because of your shameless persistence, he will get up and give you
as many loaves of bread as you need. 9 I also say to you, ask, and it will be given to
you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 10 For every asking
person receives; and the seeking person finds; and to the person who knocks, it will
be opened. 11 Which father among you, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a
snake instead of a fish? * 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will you give a scorpion to him?
13 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”
14 Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone
out, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. 15 But some
of the people said, “By Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he is driving out demons.”
16 Others tested him and sought from him a sign from heaven. 17 But Jesus knew their
thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate,
and a house divided against itself falls. 18 If Satan is divided against himself, how
will his kingdom stand? For you say I cast out demons by Beelzebul. 19 If I drive
out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of
this, they will be your judges. 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then
the kingdom of God has come to you. 21 When a strong man who is fully armed
guards his own house, his goods are safe, 22 but when a stronger man overcomes
him, the stronger man takes away the armor from the man, and plunders the man's
possessions. 23 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does
* 11:11 The best ancient copies have the shorter reading, which we follow here. Some ancient copies have a
longer reading, which also is found in Matthew 7:9: Which father among you, if your son asks for a loaf of bread,
will give him a stone? Or a fish, will give him a snake?Luke 11:24
1092
Luke 11:52
not gather with me scatters. 24 When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man,
it passes through waterless places and looks for rest. Finding none, it says, 'I will
return to my house from which I came.' 25 Having returned, it finds that house swept
out and put in order. 26 Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more
evil than itself and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man
becomes worse than the first.”
27 It happened that, as he said these things, a certain woman raised her voice above
the crowd and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that
nursed you.” 28 But he said, “Rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and
keep it.”
29 As the crowds were increasing, Jesus began to say, “This generation is an evil
generation. It seeks a sign, though no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so too the Son of Man will be a
sign to this generation. 31 The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with
the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, someone greater than Solomon is here.
32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of people
and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see, someone
greater than Jonah is here.
33 No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on
a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light. 34 Your eye is the lamp of the
body. When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. But when your eye
is bad, your body is full of darkness. 35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you is
not darkness. 36 If then your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness,
then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you.”
37 When he had finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to eat with him at his
house, so Jesus went in and reclined. 38 The Pharisee was surprised that Jesus first
did not wash before dinner. 39 But the Lord said to him, “Now then, you Pharisees
clean the outside of cups and bowls, but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil.
40 You senseless men! Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?
41 Give to the poor what is inside, and then all things will be clean for you.
42 But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every other garden
herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. It is necessary to act justly and love
God, without failing to do the other things also. 43 Woe to you Pharisees, for you love
the front seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces. 44 Woe
to you, for you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it.”
45 One of the teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, what you say insults us too.”
46 Jesus said, “Woe to you, teachers of the law! For you put people under burdens that
are hard to carry, but you do not touch the burdens with one of your own fingers.
47 Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors
who killed them. 48 So you are witnesses and you consent to the works of your
ancestors, for they indeed killed them and you build their tombs. 49 For this reason
also, God's wisdom said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and they will
persecute and kill some of them.' 50 This generation, then, will be held responsible
for all the blood of the prophets shed since the world began, 51 from Abel's blood to
the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I say
to you, this generation will be held responsible. 52 Woe to you teachers of Jewish laws,
because you have taken away the key of knowledge; you do not enter in yourselves,
and you hinder those who are entering.”Luke 11:53
1093
Luke 12:33
53 After Jesus left there, the scribes and the Pharisees opposed him and argued with
him about many things, 54 trying to trap him in his own words.
12
1 In the meantime, when many thousands of the people were gathered together,
so much that they trampled on each other, he began to say to his disciples first of
all, “Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2 But there is nothing
concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known. 3 So
whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have
spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops. 4 I say
to you my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that they
have no more that they can do. 5 But I will warn you about whom to fear. Fear the
one who, after he has killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I say to you,
fear him. 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them is
forgotten in the sight of God. 7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows. 8 I say to you, everyone
who confesses me before men, the Son of Man will also confess before the angels of
God, 9 but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
10 Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but
to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. 11 When they
bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about
how you will speak in your defense, or what you will say, 12 for the Holy Spirit will
teach you in that hour what you should say.”
13 Then someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the
inheritance with me.” 14 Jesus said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or a mediator
over you?” 15 He said to them, “Watch that you keep yourselves from all greedy
desires, because a person's life does not consist of the abundance of his possessions.”
16 Then Jesus told them a parable, saying, “The field of a rich man yielded abundantly,
17 and he reasoned with himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I do not have a place
to store my crops?' 18 He said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns and
build bigger ones, and there I will store all of my grain and other goods. 19 I will say to
my soul, “Soul, you have many goods stored up for many years. Rest easy, eat, drink,
be merry.”' 20 But God said to him, 'Foolish man, tonight your soul is required of you,
and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' 21 That is what someone is
like who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”
22 Jesus said to his disciples, “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life,
what you will eat—or about your body, what you will wear. 23 For life is more than
food, and the body is more than clothes. 24 Consider the ravens, that they do not sow
or reap. They have no storeroom or barn, but God feeds them. How much more
valuable you are than the birds! 25 Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit
to his lifespan? 26 If then you are not able to do such a very little thing, why do
you worry about the rest? 27 Consider the lilies—how they grow. They do not labor,
neither do they spin. Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed
like one of these. 28 If God so clothes the grass in the field, which exists today, and
tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little
faith! 29 Do not look for what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not be
anxious. 30 For all the nations of the world look for these things, and your Father
knows that you need them. 31 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be added
to you. 32 Do not fear, little flock, because your Father is very pleased to give you the
kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Make for yourselves pursesLuke 12:34
1094
Luke 13:2
which will not wear out—treasure in the heavens that does not run out, where no
thief comes near, and no moth destroys. 34 For where your treasure is, there your
heart will be also.
35 Let your long clothing be tucked in at your belt, and let your lamps be kept
burning, 36 and be like people looking for their master when he returns from the
marriage feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open the
door for him. 37 Blessed are those servants whom the master will find watching when
he comes. Truly I say to you, he will tuck in his long clothing at his belt, and have
them sit down at the table, and he will come and serve them. 38 If the master comes
in the second watch of the night, or if even in the third watch, and finds them ready,
blessed are those servants. 39 But understand this, that if the master of the house had
known the hour the thief was coming he would not have let his house be broken into.
40 Be ready also, because you do not know the hour when the Son of Man comes.”
41 Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable only to us, or also to everyone?”
42 The Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his lord will set
over his other servants to give them their portion of food at the right time? 43 Blessed
is that servant whom his lord finds doing that when he comes. 44 Truly I say to you
that he will set him over all his property. 45 But if that servant says in his heart, 'My
lord delays his return,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat
and drink, and to become drunk, 46 the lord of that servant will come in a day when
he does not expect, and in an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in pieces
and appoint a place for him with the unfaithful. 47 That servant, having known his
lord's will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with
many blows. 48 But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating, he
will be beaten with a few blows. But everyone who has been given much, from them
much will be required, and the one who has been entrusted with much, even more
will be asked.
49 I came to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled.
50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am distressed until it is
completed! 51 Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? No, I tell
you, but rather division. 52 For from now on there will be five in one house
divided—three people against two, and two people against three. 53 They will be
divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and
daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-
in-law against mother-in-law.”
54 Jesus was saying to the crowds also, “When you see a cloud rising in the west,
immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens. 55 When a south wind
is blowing, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens. 56 Hypocrites,
you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the heavens, but how is
it that you do not know how to interpret the present time? 57 Why do you not judge
what is right for yourselves? 58 For when you go with your adversary before the
magistrate, on the way make an effort to settle the matter with him so that he does
not drag you to the judge, and so that the judge does not deliver you to the officer,
and the officer does not throw you into prison. 59 I say to you, you will never come
out from there until you have paid the very last bit of money.”
13
1 At that time, some people there told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate
mixed with their own sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered and said to them, “Do you think that
these Galileans were more sinful than all the other Galileans because they suffered inLuke 13:3
1095
Luke 13:34
this way? 3 No, I tell you. But if you do not repent, all of you will perish in the same
way. 4 Or those eighteen people in Siloam on whom a tower fell and killed them, do
you think they were worse sinners than other men in Jerusalem? 5 No, I say. But if
you do not repent, all of you will also perish.”
6 Jesus told this parable, “Someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he
came and looked for fruit on it but found none. 7 The man said to the gardener, 'Look,
for three years I came and tried to find fruit on this fig tree and found none. Cut it
down. Why let it waste the ground?' 8 The gardener answered and said, 'Leave it
alone this year while I dig around it and put manure on it. 9 If it bears fruit next year,
good; but if it does not, cut it down!'”
10 Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues during the Sabbath. 11 Behold,
a woman was there who for eighteen years had a spirit of weakness. She was bent
over and was not able to straighten up completely. 12 When Jesus saw her, he called
to her and said, “Woman, you are freed from your weakness.” 13 He placed his hands
on her, and immediately she was straightened up and she glorified God. 14 But the
synagogue ruler was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. So the ruler
answered and said to the crowd, “There are six days in which it is necessary to work.
Come and be healed then, not on the Sabbath day.” 15 The Lord answered him and
said, “Hypocrites! Does not each of you untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and
lead it to drink on the Sabbath? 16 So too this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan
bound for eighteen long years, should her bonds not be untied on the Sabbath day?”
17 As he said these things, all those who opposed him were ashamed, but the whole
crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things he did.
18 Then Jesus said, “What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to?
19 It is like a mustard seed that a man took and threw into his garden, and it grew
into a big tree, and the birds of heaven built their nests in its branches.”
20 Again he said, “To what can I compare the kingdom of God? 21 It is like yeast that
a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it spread through all the
flour.”
22 Then Jesus traveled through the towns and villages, teaching and making his way
toward Jerusalem. 23 Someone said to him, “Lord, are only a few people to be saved?”
So he said to them, 24 “Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because, I say to
you, many will want to enter, but will not be able to enter. 25 Once the owner of the
house gets up and locks the door, then you will stand outside and pound the door
and say, 'Lord, Lord, let us in.' He will answer and say to you, 'I do not know you or
where you are from.' 26 Then you will say, 'We ate and drank in front of you and you
taught in our streets.' 27 But he will reply, 'I say to you, I do not know where you are
from. Get away from me, you evildoers!' 28 There will be crying and the grinding of
teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but
you are thrown out. 29 They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and be
seated at a table in the kingdom of God. 30 Know this, those who are least important
will be first, and those who are most important will be last.”
31 Shortly after, some Pharisees came and said to him, “Go and leave here because
Herod wants to kill you.” 32 Jesus said, “Go and tell that fox, 'Look, I cast out demons
and perform healings today and tomorrow, and the third day I will reach my goal.'
33 In any case, it is necessary for me to continue on today, tomorrow, and the following
day, since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem. 34 Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you. How often I desired
to gather your children the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but youLuke 13:35
1096
Luke 14:30
did not desire this. 35 See, your house is abandoned. I say to you, you will not see me
until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'”
14
1 It happened one Sabbath, when he went into the house of one of the leaders of
the Pharisees to eat bread, that they were watching him closely. 2 Behold, there in
front of him was a man who was suffering from edema. 3 Jesus asked the experts in
the Jewish law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?” 4 But
they kept silent. So Jesus took hold of him, healed him, and sent him away. 5 He said
to them, “Which of you who has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath
day will not immediately pull him out?” 6 They were not able to give an answer to
these things.
7 When Jesus noticed how those who were invited chose the seats of honor, he spoke
a parable, saying to them, 8 “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do
not sit down in the place of honor, because someone may have been invited who is
more honored than you. 9 When the person who invited both of you arrives, he will
say to you, 'Give this other person your place,' and then in shame you will proceed
to take the lowest place. 10 But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest
place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend,
go up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table
with you. 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles
himself will be exalted.”
12 Jesus also said to the man who had invited him, “When you give a dinner or a
banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich
neighbors, as they may also invite you in return, and you will be repaid. 13 But when
you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, 14 and
you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid in the
resurrection of the just.”
15 When one of them who sat at the table with Jesus heard these things, he said to
him, “Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!” 16 But Jesus said to
him, “A certain man prepared a large dinner and invited many. 17 When the dinner
was prepared, he sent his servant to say to those who were invited, 'Come, because
everything is now ready.' 18 They all alike began to make excuses. The first said to
him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please excuse me.' 19 Another
said, 'I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse
me.' 20 Then another man said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'
21 The servant came and told his master these things. Then the master of the house
became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the
town and bring in here the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.' 22 The servant
said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and yet there is still room.' 23 The
master said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them
to come in, that my house may be filled. 24 For I say to you, none of those men who
were invited will taste my dinner.'”
25 Now large crowds were going with him, and he turned and said to them, 26 “If
anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers
and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. 27 Whoever does not
carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. 28 For which of you
who desires to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate
if he has what he needs to complete it? 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation
and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him, 30 saying, 'This manLuke 14:31
1097
Luke 15:29
began to build and was not able to finish.' 31 Or what king, as he goes to encounter
another king in war, will not sit down first and take advice about whether he is able
with ten thousand men to fight the other king who comes against him with twenty
thousand men? 32 If not, while the other army is still far away, he sends a delegation
and asks for conditions of peace. 33 So therefore, any one of you who does not give
up all that he has cannot be my disciple. 34 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its
taste, how can it be made salty again? 35 It is of no use for the soil or even for the
manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
15
1 Now all the tax collectors and other sinners were coming to Jesus to listen to
him. 2 Both the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled to each other, saying, “This man
welcomes sinners, and even eats with them.”
3 Jesus spoke this parable to them, saying, 4 “Which one of you, if he has a hundred
sheep and then loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness,
and go after the lost one until he finds it? 5 Then when he has found it, he lays it
across his shoulders and rejoices. 6 When he comes to the house, he calls together his
friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost
sheep.' 7 I say to you that even so, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who
repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not
light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it? 9 When she
has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me,
for I have found the coin which I lost.' 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the
presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
11 Then Jesus said, “A certain man had two sons, 12 and the younger of them said to
his father, 'Father, give me the portion of the wealth that falls to me.' So he divided his
property between them. 13 Not many days later, the younger son gathered together
all he owned and went to a country far away, and there he wasted all his wealth
by living recklessly. 14 Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine spread
through that country, and he began to be in need. 15 He went and hired himself
out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
16 He would gladly have eaten the carob pods that the pigs ate, because no one gave
him anything. 17 But when the young son came to himself, he said, 'How many of
my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from
hunger! 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have
sinned against heaven and against you. 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your
son; make me as one of your hired servants.”' 20 So the young son left and came
toward his father. While he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved
with compassion, and he ran and embraced him and kissed him. 21 The son said to
him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy
to be called your son.' 22 The father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe,
and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet. 23 Then bring
the fattened calf and kill it. Let us celebrate with a feast! 24 For my son was dead,
and now he is alive. He was lost, and now he is found.' Then they began to celebrate.
25 Now his older son was out in the field. As he came and approached the house, he
heard music and dancing. 26 He called to one of the servants and asked what these
things might be. 27 The servant said to him, 'Your brother has come home and your
father has killed the fattened calf because he has returned safely.' 28 The older son
was angry and would not go in, and his father came out and begged him. 29 But theLuke 15:30
1098
Luke 16:25
older son answered and said to his father, 'Look, these many years I slaved for you,
and I never broke a rule of yours, and yet you never gave me a young goat that I
might celebrate with my friends, 30 but when your son came, who has devoured your
living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf.' 31 The father said to him,
'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. 32 But it was proper for
us to feast and be happy, for this brother of yours was dead, and is now alive; he was
lost, and has now been found.'”
16
1 Jesus also said to the disciples, “There was a certain rich man who had a manager,
and it was reported to him that this manager was wasting his possessions. 2 So the
rich man called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an
account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.' 3 The manager said
to himself, 'What should I do, since my master is taking away my management job? I
do not have strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. 4 I know what I will do, so that
when I am removed from my management job, people will welcome me into their
houses.' 5 Then the manager called for each one of his master's debtors, and he asked
the first one, 'How much do you owe to my master?' 6 He said, 'A hundred baths of
olive oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.' 7 Then the
manager said to another, 'How much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.'
He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.' 8 The master then commended the
unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the children of this world
are more shrewd in dealing with their own people than are the children of light. 9 I
say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when
it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings. 10 He who is faithful in
very little is also faithful in much, and he who is unrighteous in very little is also
unrighteous in much. 11 If you have not been faithful in using unrighteous wealth,
who will trust you with true wealth? 12 If you have not been faithful in using other
people's property, who will give you money of your own? 13 No servant can serve two
masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted
to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.”
14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they
ridiculed him. 15 He said to them, “You justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God
knows your hearts. That which is exalted among men is detestable in the sight of
God. 16 The law and the prophets were in effect until John came. From that time on,
the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone tries to force their way
into it. 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a
letter of the law to become invalid.
18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he
who marries one who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.
19 Now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and
was enjoying every day his great wealth. 20 A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid
at his gate, covered with sores, 21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's
table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 It came about that the beggar died
and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and
was buried, 23 and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham
far away and Lazarus at his side. 24 So he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have
mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.' 25 But Abraham said, 'Child, remember
that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evilLuke 16:26
1099
Luke 17:27
things. But now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. 26 Besides all this, a
great chasm has been put in place, so that those who want to cross over from here
to you cannot, and no one can cross over from there to us.' 27 The rich man said,
'I beg you, Father Abraham, that you would send him to my father's house— 28 for
I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so that it may not be that
they come into this place of torment.' 29 But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the
prophets; let them listen to them.' 30 The rich man replied, 'No, Father Abraham, but
if someone would go to them from the dead, they will repent.' 31 But Abraham said to
him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded
if someone rises from the dead.'”
17
1 Jesus said to his disciples, “It is certain there will be things that can cause us to
sin, but woe to that person through whom they come! 2 It would be better for him if
a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than that he
should cause one of these little ones to stumble. 3 Watch yourselves. If your brother
sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 4 If he sins against you seven times
in the day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him!”
5 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.” 6 The Lord said, “If you had
faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted, and be
planted in the sea,' and it would obey you. 7 But which of you, who has a servant
plowing or keeping sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come
immediately and sit down to eat'? 8 Will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for
me to eat, and put a belt around your clothes and serve me until I have finished
eating and drinking. Then afterward you will eat and drink'? 9 He does not thank
the servant because he did the things that were commanded, does he? 10 Even so you
also, when you have done everything that you are commanded, should say, 'We are
unworthy servants. We have only done what we ought to do.'”
11 It came about that as he traveled to Jerusalem, he went along the border between
Samaria and Galilee. 12 As he entered into a certain village, there he was met by ten
men who were lepers. They stood far away from him 13 and they lifted up their voices,
saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” 14 When he saw them, he said to them, “Go
and show yourselves to the priests.” As they went away they were cleansed. 15 When
one of them saw that he was healed, he turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God.
16 He fell down at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. He was a Samaritan. 17 Then Jesus
said, “Were not the ten cleansed? Where are the nine? 18 Were there no others who
returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?” 19 He said to him, “Arise, and
go. Your faith has made you well.”
20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus
answered them and said, “The kingdom of God does not come with careful observing.
21 Neither will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or, 'There it is!' For look, the kingdom of
God is within you.”
22 He said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will desire to see one
of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. 23 Then they will say to you,
'Look, there! Look, here!' But do not go out or run after them, 24 for as the lightning
shines brightly when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky,
so will the Son of Man be in his day. 25 But first he must suffer many things and be
rejected by this generation. 26 As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it also
happen in the days of the Son of Man. 27 They ate, they drank, they married, and
they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark—and theLuke 17:28
1100
Luke 18:23
flood came and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise, even as it happened in the days of
Lot—they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 29 But
in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and
destroyed them all. 30 After the same manner it will be in the day that the Son of Man
is revealed. 31 In that day, do not let him who is on the housetop go down to get his
goods out of the house; and do not let him who is in the field return. 32 Remember
Lot's wife. 33 Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life
will save it. 34 I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. One will
be taken, and the other will be left. 35 There will be two women grinding together.
One will be taken, and the other will be left.” 36 * 37 They asked him, “Where, Lord?”
and he said to them, “Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered
together.”
18
1 Then he spoke a parable to them about how they should always pray and not
become discouraged, 2 saying, “In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear
God and did not respect people. 3 Now there was a widow in that city, and she came
often to him, saying, 'Help me get justice against my opponent.' 4 For a long time he
was not willing to help her, but after a while he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear
God or respect man, 5 yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will help her get
justice, so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming.'” 6 Then the Lord
said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. 7 Now will not God also bring justice to
his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? 8 I
say to you that he will bring justice to them speedily. Even so, when the Son of Man
comes, will he indeed find faith on the earth?”
9 Then he also spoke this parable to some who were persuaded in themselves that
they were righteous and who despised other people, 10 “Two men went up into the
temple to pray—the one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector. 11 The
Pharisee stood and prayed these things about himself, 'God, I thank you that I am
not like other people—robbers, unrighteous people, adulterers—or even like this tax
collector. 12 I fast two times every week. I give tithes of all that I get.' 13 But the tax
collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but hit
his breast, saying, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.' 14 I say to you, this man went
back down to his house justified rather than the other, because everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.”
15 The people were also bringing to him their infants so that he might touch them,
but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called them to him,
saying, “Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For the
kingdom of God belongs to such ones. 17 Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive
the kingdom of God like a child will definitely not enter it.”
18 A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal
life?” 19 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God
alone. 20 You know the commandments—do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not
steal, do not testify falsely, honor your father and mother.” 21 The ruler said, “All
these things I have obeyed from the time I was a youth.” 22 When Jesus heard that,
he said to him, “One thing you still lack. You must sell all that you have and distribute
it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.” 23 But
when the ruler heard these things, he became extremely sad, for he was very rich.
* 17:36 Luke 17:36 the best ancient copies omit, vs. 36 There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the
other left .Luke 18:24
1101
Luke 19:15
24 Then Jesus, seeing him, became very sad * and said, “How difficult it is for those
who are rich to enter the kingdom of God! 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through
a needle's eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” 26 Those hearing it
said, “Then who can be saved?” 27 Jesus answered, “The things which are impossible
with people are possible with God.” 28 Peter said, “Well, we have left everything that
is our own and have followed you.” 29 Jesus then said to them, “Truly, I say to you
that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children,
for the sake of the kingdom of God, 30 who will not receive much more in this world,
and in the world to come, eternal life.”
31 After he gathered the twelve to himself, he said to them, “See, we are going up
to Jerusalem, and all the things that have been written by the prophets about the Son
of Man will be accomplished. 32 For he will be given over to the Gentiles, and will
be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon. 33 After whipping him, they will
kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.” 34 They understood none of these
things, and this word was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things
that were said.
35 It came about that, as Jesus approached Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting
by the road begging, 36 and hearing a crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
37 They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 38 So the blind man cried
out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.” 39 The ones who were walking
ahead rebuked the blind man, telling him to be quiet. But he cried out all the more,
“Son of David, have mercy on me.” 40 Jesus stood still and commanded that the man
be brought to him. Then when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him, 41 “What do
you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, I want to receive my sight.” 42 Jesus said
to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.” 43 Immediately he received
his sight and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw this, gave
praise to God.
19
1 Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho. 2 Behold, there was a man there
named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich. 3 He was trying to see
who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd, because he was small in height.
4 So he ran on ahead of the people and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him,
because Jesus was about to pass that way. 5 When Jesus came to the place, he looked
up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your
house.” 6 So he hurried and came down and welcomed him joyfully. 7 When everyone
saw this, they all complained, saying, “He has gone in to visit a man who is a sinner.”
8 Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the
poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount.”
9 Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son
of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the people who are lost.”
11 As they heard these things, he continued speaking and told a parable, because he
was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear
immediately. 12 He said therefore, “A certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom and then to return. 13 He called ten of his servants, and
gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Conduct business until I come back.' 14 But
his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We will not have this
man rule over us.' 15 It happened when he came back again, having received the
* 18:24 Scholars are divided whether the phrase: [he] became very sad should be included here. Compare vs
23.Luke 19:16
1102
Luke 20:1
kingdom, he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called
to him, that he might know what profit they had made by doing business. 16 The
first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.' 17 The
nobleman said to him, 'Well done, good servant. Because you were faithful in very
little, you will have authority over ten cities.' 18 The second came, saying, 'Your mina,
lord, has made five minas.' 19 The nobleman said to him, 'You take charge over five
cities.' 20 Another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept safely in a
cloth, 21 for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding person. You take up
what you did not put in, and you reap what you did not sow.' 22 The nobleman said
to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I
am a demanding person, that I take up what I did not put in, and that I reaped what
I did not sow. 23 Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I
returned I would have collected it with interest?' 24 The nobleman said to them that
stood by, 'Take away from him the mina, and give it to him that has the ten minas.'
25 They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.' 26 'I say to you, that everyone who has
will be given more, but from him that has not, even that which he has will be taken
away. 27 But these enemies of mine, those who did not want me to reign over them,
bring them here and kill them before me.'”
28 When he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
29 It came about that when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill that
is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, 30 saying, “Go into the next village. As you
enter, you will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me. 31 If
anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord has need of it.'” 32 Those
who were sent went and found the colt just as Jesus had told them. 33 As they were
untying the colt, the owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” 34 They
said, “The Lord has need of it.” 35 They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their cloaks
upon the colt and set Jesus on it. 36 As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road.
37 As he was now approaching the place where the Mount of Olives descends, the
whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice
for all the mighty works which they had seen, 38 saying, “Blessed is the king who
comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” 39 Some of
the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” 40 Jesus
answered and said, “I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would cry out.”
41 When Jesus approached the city, he wept over it, 42 saying, “If only you had
known in this day, even you, the things which bring you peace! But now they are
hidden from your eyes. 43 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will
build a barricade around you, and surround you, and press in on you from every
side. 44 They will strike you down to the ground and your children with you. They
will not leave one stone upon another, because you did not recognize it when God
was trying to save you.”
45 Jesus entered the temple and began to cast out those who were selling, 46 saying
to them, “It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a
den of robbers.”
47 So Jesus was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and
the leaders of the people wanted to kill him, 48 but they could not find a way to do it,
because all the people were listening to him intently.
1 It
20
came about one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and
preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came to him with the elders.Luke 20:2
1103
Luke 20:37
2 They spoke, saying to him, “Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who
it is who gave you this authority.” 3 He answered and said to them, “I will also ask
you a question, and you tell me. 4 The baptism of John: was it from heaven or from
men?” 5 They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, 'From heaven,' he will
say, 'Then why did you not believe him?' 6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people
will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” 7 So they answered
that they did not know where it came from. 8 Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell
you by what authority I do these things.”
9 He told the people this parable, “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to vine
growers, and went into another country for a long time. 10 At the appointed time
he sent a servant to the vine growers, that they should give him of the fruit of the
vineyard. But the vine growers beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 11 He
then sent yet another servant and they also beat him, treated him shamefully, and
sent him away empty-handed. 12 He also sent yet a third and they also wounded him,
and threw him out. 13 So the lord of the vineyard said, 'What will I do? I will send
my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.' 14 But when the vine growers saw
him, they discussed among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, that
the inheritance may be ours.' 15 They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and destroy
these vine growers, and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard it, they
said, “May it never be!” 17 But Jesus looked at them, and said, “What is the meaning
of that which is written:
'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?
18 Every one who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But on whomever it
falls, it will crush.”
19 So the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour,
for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid
of the people. 20 Watching him carefully, they sent out spies who pretended to be
righteous, that they might find fault with his speech, so as to deliver him up to the
rule and to the authority of the governor. 21 They asked him, saying, “Teacher, we
know that you say and teach rightly, and are not influenced by anyone's position,
but you teach the truth about the way of God. 22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to
Caesar, or not?” 23 But Jesus understood their craftiness, and said to them, 24 “Show
me a denarius. Whose image and name is on it?” They said, “Caesar's.” 25 He said
to them, “Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that
are God's.” 26 They were not able to find fault with what he had said in front of the
people, but marveling at his answer, they were silent.
27 When some of the Sadducees came to him, the ones who say that there is no
resurrection, 28 they asked him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's
brother dies, having a wife, and being childless, the man should take the brother's
wife, and have a child for his brother. 29 There were seven brothers and the first took
a wife, and died childless, 30 and the second as well. 31 The third took her, and likewise
the seven also left no children, and died. 32 Afterward the woman also died. 33 In
the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife.”
34 Jesus said to them, “The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage. 35 But
those who are regarded as worthy in that age to receive the resurrection from the
dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. 36 Neither can they die anymore,
for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the bush,
where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God ofLuke 20:38
1104
Luke 21:25
Jacob. 38 Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, because all live to him.”
39 Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have answered well.” 40 For they did
not dare ask him any more questions.
41 Jesus said to them, “How do they say that the Christ is David's son? 42 For David
himself says in the Book of Psalms,
The Lord said to my Lord,
'Sit at my right hand,
43 until I make your enemies your footstool.'
44 David therefore calls the Christ 'Lord', so how is he David's son?”
45 In the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, 46 “Beware of the scribes,
who desire to walk in long robes, and love special greetings in the marketplaces, and
chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts. 47 They also devour widows'
houses, and for a show they make long prayers. Men like this will receive greater
condemnation.”
21
1 Jesus looked up and saw the rich men who were putting their gifts into the
treasury. 2 He saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites. 3 So he said, “Truly I
say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them. 4 All of these gave gifts out
of their abundance. But this widow, out of her poverty, put in all she had to live on.”
5 As some spoke of the temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and
offerings, he said, 6 “As for these things that you see, the days will come when not
one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down.” 7 So they asked him,
saying, “Teacher, when will these things happen? What will be the sign when these
things are about to happen?” 8 Jesus answered, “Be careful that you are not deceived.
For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not go
after them. 9 When you hear of wars and riots, do not be terrified, for these things
must happen first, but the end will not happen immediately.”
10 Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom. 11 There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and
plagues. There will be terrifying events and great signs from heaven. 12 But before
all of these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering
you over to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors
because of my name. 13 It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony. 14 Therefore
resolve in your hearts not to prepare your defense ahead of time, 15 for I will give you
words and wisdom that all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.
16 But you will be delivered up also by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and
they will put some of you to death. 17 You will be hated by everyone because of my
name. 18 But not a hair of your head will perish. 19 In your endurance you will gain
your souls.
20 When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its destruction
is near. 21 Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the city
leave it, and those who are out in the country must not enter the city. 22 For these
are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written will be fulfilled. 23 Woe
to them who are pregnant and to them who are nursing in those days! For there will
be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people. 24 They will fall by the edge
of the sword, and they will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be
trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
25 There will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars, and on the earth.
The nations will be in distress, anxious because of the roar of the sea and waves.Luke 21:26
1105
Luke 22:23
26 There will be men fainting from fear and from expectation of the things which
are coming upon the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 27 Then
they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 But
when these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your
deliverance is coming near.”
29 Jesus told them a parable, “Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. 30 When they
sprout buds, you see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. 31 So
also, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is
near. 32 Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things
take place. 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
34 But pay attention to yourselves, so that your hearts are not burdened with the
effects of drinking and intoxication, and the worries of life, and then that day will
close on you suddenly like a trap. 35 For it will come upon everyone living on the
face of the whole earth. 36 But be alert at all times, praying that you may be strong
enough to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of
Man.”
37 So during the days he was teaching in the temple, and at night he went out and
stayed on the Mount of Olives. 38 All of the people came early in the morning to hear
him in the temple.
22
1 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread was approaching, which is called the
Passover. 2 The chief priests and the scribes discussed how they could put Jesus
to death, for they were afraid of the people.
3 Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve. 4 Judas went
to the chief priests and captains and discussed with them how he would betray Jesus
to them. 5 They were glad, and agreed to give him money. 6 He consented, and looked
for an opportunity to deliver him to them away from the crowd.
7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be
sacrificed. 8 So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare for us the Passover
meal, so that we may eat it.” 9 They said to him, “Where do you want us to make
preparations?” 10 He answered them, “Listen, when you have entered the city, a man
bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he goes into.
11 Then say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest
room, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples?”' 12 He will show you a large
furnished upper room. Make the preparations there.” 13 So they went, and found
everything as he had said to them. Then they prepared the Passover meal.
14 When the time came, he sat down with the apostles. 15 Then he said to them,
“I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 16 For I say to
you, I will not eat it again, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 17 Then Jesus
took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, “Take this, and share it among
yourselves. 18 For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again until the
kingdom of God comes.” 19 Then he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he
broke it, and gave to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this
in remembrance of me.” 20 He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying,
“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. 21 But pay
attention. The one who betrays me is with me at the table. 22 For the Son of Man
indeed goes as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is
betrayed!” 23 They began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might
be who would do this.Luke 22:24
1106
Luke 22:59
24 Then there arose also a quarrel among them about which of them was considered
to be greatest. 25 He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles are masters over them,
and the ones who have authority over them are referred to as those who do good
to their people. 26 But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is
the greatest among you become like the youngest, and let the one who is the most
important become like the one who serves. 27 For who is greater, the one who sits
at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am
among you as one who serves. 28 But you are the ones who have continued with me
in my temptations. 29 I give to you a kingdom, even as my Father has given a kingdom
to me, 30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
31 Simon, Simon, be aware, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.
32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. After you have turned back
again, strengthen your brothers.” 33 Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with
you both to prison and to death.” 34 Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will
not crow this day, before you deny three times that you know me.”
35 Then Jesus said to them, “When I sent you out without a purse, a bag of
provisions, or shoes, did you lack anything?” They answered, “Nothing.” 36 Then
he said to them, “But now, the one who has a purse, let him take it, and also a bag
of provisions. The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.
37 For I say to you, what is written about me must be fulfilled, 'He was counted with
the lawless ones.' For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled.” 38 Then they
said, “Lord, look! Here are two swords.” He said to them, “It is enough.”
39 Jesus went, as he often did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
40 When they arrived, he said to them, “Pray that you do not enter into temptation.”
41 He went away from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
42 saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not
my will, but yours be done.” 43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him,
strengthening him. 44 Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat
became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. 45 When he rose
up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of
their sorrow, 46 and asked them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray, that you may
not enter into temptation.”
47 While he was still speaking, behold, a crowd appeared, with Judas, one of the
twelve, leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him, 48 but Jesus said to him,
“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” 49 When those who were
around Jesus saw what was happening, they said, “Lord, should we strike with the
sword?” 50 Then one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his
right ear. 51 Jesus said, “That is enough!” He touched his ear, and healed him. 52 Jesus
said to the chief priests, to the captains of the temple, and to elders who came against
him, “Do you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? 53 When I was
daily with you in the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour,
and the authority of darkness.”
54 Seizing him, they led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house.
But Peter followed from a distance. 55 After they had kindled a fire in the middle of
the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them. 56 A certain
female servant saw him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looked straight at him
and said, “This man also was with him.” 57 But Peter denied it, saying, “Woman, I do
not know him.” 58 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You are also
one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” 59 After about an hour another manLuke 22:60
1107
Luke 23:25
insisted and said, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean.” 60 But Peter
said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” Immediately, while he was speaking,
a rooster crowed. 61 Turning, the Lord looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the
word of the Lord, when he said to him, “Before a rooster crows today you will deny
me three times.” 62 Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
63 Then the men guarding Jesus mocked and beat him. 64 They put a cover over
him and asked him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?” 65 They spoke
many other things against Jesus, blaspheming him.
66 As soon as it was day, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests
and scribes. They led him into the council 67 and said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”
But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe, 68 and if I ask you, you will not
answer. 69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the
power of God.” 70 They all said, “Then you are the Son of God?” Jesus said to them,
“You say that I am.” 71 They said, “Why do we still need a witness? For we ourselves
have heard from his own mouth.”
23
1 The whole company of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate. 2 They began
to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding to give
tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” 3 Pilate asked him,
saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered him and said, “You say so.”
4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no fault in this man.” 5 But
they were insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee even to this place.” 6 So when Pilate heard this, he asked
whether the man was a Galilean. 7 When he discovered that he was under Herod's
authority, he sent Jesus to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.
8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, because he had wanted to see him for a
long time. He had heard about him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
9 Herod questioned Jesus in many words, but Jesus answered him nothing. 10 The
chief priests and the scribes stood, violently accusing him. 11 Herod with his soldiers
insulted Jesus and they mocked him. Then they dressed him in elegant clothes and
sent him back to Pilate. 12 For Herod and Pilate had become friends with each other
that very day, for before this they had been enemies with each other.
13 Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of
people, 14 and said to them, “You brought to me this man like a man who is leading
the people to act badly, and see, I, having questioned him before you, find no fault in
this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. 15 No, nor does Herod,
for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
16 I will therefore punish him, and release him.” 17 * 18 But they cried out all together,
saying, “Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!” 19 Barabbas was a man
who had been put into prison for a certain rebellion in the city and for murder.
20 Pilate addressed them again, desiring to release Jesus. 21 But they shouted, saying,
“Crucify him, crucify him.” 22 He said to them a third time, “Why, what evil has
this man done? I have found nothing deserving the death penalty in him. Therefore
after punishing him, I will release him.” 23 But they were insistent with loud voices,
demanding for him to be crucified. Their voices convinced Pilate. 24 So Pilate decided
to grant their demand. 25 He released the one they asked for who had been put in
prison for rioting and murder. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.
* 23:17 The best ancient copies omit Luk. 23:17, Now Pilate was obligated to release to the Jews one prisoner at
the feast .Luke 23:26
1108
Luke 24:6
26 As they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country,
and they laid the cross on him to carry, following Jesus.
27 A great crowd of the people, and of women who grieved and mourned for him,
were following him. 28 But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do
not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 29 For see, the days
are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that did
not bear, and the breasts that did not nurse.' 30 Then they will begin to say to the
mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' 31 For if they do these things while
the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
32 Other men, two criminals, were led away with him to be put to death.
33 When they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” there they crucified him,
and the criminals—one on his right and one on his left. 34 Jesus said, “Father, forgive
them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Then they cast lots, dividing up
his garments. 35 The people stood watching while the rulers also were mocking him,
saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the chosen
one.” 36 The soldiers also ridiculed him, approaching him, offering him vinegar, 37 and
saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.” 38 There was also a sign over
him, “This is the King of the Jews.”
39 One of the criminals who was hanging there insulted him by saying, “Are you not
the Christ? Save yourself and us.” 40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not
fear God, since you are under the same sentence? 41 We indeed are here justly, for
we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds. But this man did nothing wrong.”
42 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” 43 Jesus
said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”
44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until
the ninth hour 45 as the sun's light failed. Then the curtain of the temple was split
in two. 46 Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, “Father, into your hands I commit
my spirit.” Having said this, he died. 47 When the centurion saw what was done, he
glorified God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man.” 48 When all the multitudes
who came together to witness this sight saw the things that were done, they returned
beating their breasts. 49 But all those who knew him, and the women who followed
him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
50 Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council. He
was a good and righteous man. 51 This man had not agreed with the decision of the
Council and their action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea; and he was
looking for the kingdom of God. 52 This man, approaching Pilate, asked for the body
of Jesus. 53 He took it down, wrapped it in fine linen, and placed it in a tomb that was
cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. 54 It was the Day of the Preparation,
and the Sabbath was about to begin. 55 The women who had come with Jesus out of
Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. 56 They returned, and
prepared spices and ointments.
Then on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
24
1 Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices
which they had prepared. 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 3 They
entered in, but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 It happened that, while they
were confused about this, suddenly, two men stood by them in bright shining robes.
5 As the women were filled with fear and bowed down their faces to the earth, they
said to the women, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? 6 He is not here,Luke 24:7
1109
Luke 24:41
but has been raised! Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,
7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and
be crucified, and on the third day rise again.” 8 The women remembered his words,
9 and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven and all the rest.
10 Now Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women
with them reported these things to the apostles. 11 But this message seemed like idle
talk to the apostles, and they did not believe the women. 12 Yet Peter rose up and
ran to the tomb, and stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves.
Peter then departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
13 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which
was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. 14 They discussed with each other about all the
things that had happened. 15 It happened that, while they discussed and questioned
together, Jesus himself approached and went with them. 16 But their eyes were
prevented from recognizing him. 17 Jesus said to them, “What are the two of you
talking about as you walk?” They stood there looking sad. 18 One of them, named
Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only person in Jerusalem who does not know
the things which have happened there these days?” 19 Jesus said to them, “What
things?” They answered him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was
a prophet, mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 and how the
chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified
him. 21 But we had confidence that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.
Yes, and what is more, it is now the third day since all these things happened. 22 But
also, some women of our company amazed us, having been at the tomb early in
the morning. 23 When they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had
also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 24 Some men who were
with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said. But they did
not see him.” 25 Jesus said to them, “O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in
all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer
these things, and to enter into his glory?” 27 Then beginning from Moses and through
all the prophets, Jesus interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the
scriptures. 28 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted
as though he were going further. 29 But they compelled him, saying, “Stay with us,
for it is toward evening and the day is almost over.” So Jesus went in to stay with
them. 30 It happened that, when he had sat down with them to eat, he took the bread,
blessed it, and breaking it, he gave it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened, and
they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. 32 They said one to another, “Was
not our heart burning within us, while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened
to us the scriptures?” 33 They rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem.
They found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them, 34 saying,
“The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.” 35 So they told the things
that happened on the way, and how Jesus was shown to them in the breaking of the
bread.
36 As they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to
them, “Peace be to you.” 37 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed
that they saw a spirit. 38 Jesus said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why do questions
arise in your heart? 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and
see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see me having.” 40 When he
had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 They still could not believe
it because of joy, and they were amazed. Jesus said to them, “Do you have anythingLuke 24:42
1110
Luke 24:53
to eat?” 42 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it before
them.
44 He said to them, “When I was with you, I told you that all that was written in the
Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” 45 Then he opened
their minds, that they might understand the scriptures. 46 He said to them, “Thus it
is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead on the third
day. 47 Repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all the
nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 48 You are witnesses of these things. 49 See, I am
sending you what my Father promised. But remain in the city until you are clothed
with power from on high.”
50 Then Jesus led them out until they were near Bethany. He lifted up his hands
and blessed them. 51 It happened that, while he was blessing them, he left them and
was carried up into heaven. 52 So they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem
with great joy. 53 They were continually in the temple, blessing God.John 1:1
1111
John 1:38
John
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. 2 This one was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him,
and without him there was not one thing made that has been made. 4 In him was life,
and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness
did not overcome it. 6 There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was
John. 7 He came as a witness to testify about the light, that all might believe through
him. 8 John was not the light, but came that he might testify about the light. 9 The true
light, which gives light to all men, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him. 11 He came
to his own, and his own did not receive him. 12 But to as many as received him, who
believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God. 13 These were not
born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 The
Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, glory as of the one
and only who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John testified about
him and cried out, saying, “This was the one of whom I said, 'He who comes after
me is greater than I am, for he was before me.'” 16 For from his fullness we have all
received grace after grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth
came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The one and only
God, who is at the side of the Father, he has made him known.
19 This is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him
from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” 20 He confessed—he did not deny, but
confessed—”I am not the Christ.” 21 So they asked him, “What are you then? Are you
Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” They said, “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.”
22 Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who
sent us? What do you say about yourself?” 23 He said,
“I am a voice, crying in the wilderness:
'Make the way of the Lord straight,'
just as Isaiah the prophet said.” 24 Now some from the Pharisees were sent, 25 and
they asked him and said to him, “Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ
nor Elijah nor the prophet?” 26 John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water.
But among you stands someone you do not know. 27 He is the one who comes after
me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” 28 These things were done
in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 29 The next
day John saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look, there is the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is the one of whom I said, 'The one who
comes after me is more than me, for he was before me.' 31 I did not know him, but it
was so that he could be revealed to Israel that I came baptizing with water.” 32 John
testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it stayed
upon him. 33 I did not recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to
me, 'Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, he is the
one baptizing in the Holy Spirit.' 34 I have both seen and testified that this is the Son
of God.”
35 Again, the next day, as John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 they saw
Jesus walking by, and John said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” 37 His two disciples heard
him say this and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned and saw them following
him and said to them, “What do you want?” They replied, “Rabbi (which translatedJohn 1:39
1112
John 2:22
means teacher), where are you staying?” 39 He said to them, “Come and see.” Then
they came and saw where he was staying; they stayed with him that day, for it was
about the tenth hour. 40 One of the two who heard John speak and then followed Jesus
was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter. 41 He first found his own brother Simon and
said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated is: Christ). 42 He brought
him to Jesus, and Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will
be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).
43 The next day, when Jesus wanted to leave to go to Galilee, he found Philip and
said to him, “Follow me.” 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and
Peter. 45 Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, “He of whom Moses wrote in the
law, and the prophets, we have found him: Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”
46 Nathaniel said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to
him, “Come and see.” 47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said about him, “See,
a true Israelite, in whom is no deceit!” 48 Nathaniel said to him, “How do you know
me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were
under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Nathaniel replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God!
You are the King of Israel!” 50 Jesus replied and said to him, “Because I said to you,
'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than
this.” 51 Then he said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened, and
the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”

1 Three days later, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus
was there. 2 Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding. 3 When the wine
ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” 4 Jesus said to her,
“Woman, why do you come to me? My time has not yet come.” 5 His mother said to
the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.” 6 Now there were six stone water pots
there used for the Jewish ceremonial washing, each containing two to three metretes.
7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” So they filled them up to the
brim. 8 Then he told the servants, “Take some out now and take it to the head waiter.”
So they did. 9 The head waiter tasted the water that had become wine, but he did not
know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew). Then
he called the bridegroom 10 and said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first
and then the cheaper wine when they are drunk. But you have kept the good wine
until now.” 11 This first sign Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his glory,
and his disciples believed in him. 12 After this Jesus, his mother, his brothers, and his
disciples went down to Capernaum and they stayed there for a few days.
13 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 He
found sellers of oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers were sitting
there. 15 So he made a whip of cords and drove all of them out from the temple,
including both the sheep and the oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers
and overthrew their tables. 16 To the pigeon sellers he said, “Take these things away
from here. Stop making the house of my Father a marketplace.” 17 His disciples
remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.” 18 Then the
Jewish authorities responded and said to him, “What sign will you show us, since you
are doing these things?” 19 Jesus replied, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will
raise it up.” 20 Then the Jewish authorities said, “This temple was built in forty-six
years, and you will raise it up in three days?” 21 However, he was speaking about the
temple of his body. 22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples rememberedJohn 2:23
1113
John 3:29
that he said this, and they believed the scripture and this statement that Jesus had
spoken.
23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover festival, many believed in his
name when they saw the signs that he did. 24 But Jesus did not trust in them because
he knew them all, 25 because he did not need anyone to testify to him about man, for
he knew what was in man.
3
1 Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a Jewish leader. 2 This
man came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher
that came from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with
him.” 3 Jesus replied to him, “Truly, truly, unless someone is born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when
he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can
he?” 5 Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and
that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You
must be born again.' 8 The wind blows wherever it wishes; you hear its sound, but
you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So is everyone who is
born of the Spirit.” 9 Nicodemus replied and said to him, “How can these things be?”
10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not
understand these things? 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and we
testify about what we have seen. Yet you do not accept our testimony. 12 If I told you
about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about
heavenly things? 13 No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from
heaven—the Son of Man. 14 Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so
must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 so that all who believe in him may have eternal
life.
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send the Son
into the world in order to condemn the world, but in order to save the world through
him. 18 He who believes in him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is
already condemned because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son
of God. 19 This is the reason for the judgment: The light has come into the world, and
men loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. 20 For
everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, so that his
deeds will not be exposed. 21 However, he who practices the truth comes to the light
so that it may be plainly seen that his deeds have been done in God.”
22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea. There he spent
some time with them and baptized. 23 Now John was also baptizing in Aenon near
to Salim because there was much water there. People were coming to him and were
being baptized, 24 for John had not yet been thrown in prison. 25 Then there arose
a dispute between some of John's disciples and a Jew about ceremonial washing.
26 They went to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other
side of the Jordan River, about whom you have testified, look, he is baptizing, and
they are all going to him.” 27 John replied, “A man cannot receive anything unless it
has been given to him from heaven. 28 You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am
not the Christ,' but instead, 'I have been sent before him.' 29 The bride belongs to the
bridegroom. Now the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoicesJohn 3:30
1114
John 4:28
greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom. This, then, is my joy made complete.
30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
31 He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth is from the
earth and speaks about the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. 32 He
testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. 33 He
who has received his testimony has confirmed that God is true. 34 For the one whom
God has sent speaks the words of God. For he does not give the Spirit by measure.
35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 He who believes
in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the
wrath of God stays on him.”
4
1 Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and
baptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his
disciples were), 3 he left Judea and went back again to Galilee. 4 But it was necessary
for him to go through Samaria. 5 So he came to a town of Samaria, called Sychar,
near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6 The well of Jacob was
there. Jesus was tired from his journey and sat by the well. It was about the sixth
hour. 7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me some
water to drink.” 8 For his disciples had gone away into the town to buy food. 9 Then
the Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, are asking me,
being a Samaritan woman, for something to drink?” For Jews have no dealings with
Samaritans. 10 Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God, and
who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he
would have given you living water.” 11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you do not have
a bucket and the well is deep. Where then do you have the living water? 12 You are
not greater, are you, than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it
himself, as did his sons and his cattle?” 13 Jesus replied and said to her, “Everyone
who drinks from this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks from the
water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. Instead, the water that I will
give him will become a fountain of water in him, springing up to eternal life.” 15 The
woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I may not become thirsty and not
have to come here to draw water.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and
come back here.” 17 The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.”
Jesus replied, “You are right in saying, 'I have no husband,' 18 for you have had five
husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is
true.” 19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathers
worshiped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people
have to worship.” 21 Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming
when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 22 You
worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, for salvation is from the
Jews. 23 However, the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to be his
worshipers. 24 God is Spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit
and truth.” 25 The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming (the one
called Christ). When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” 26 Jesus said to her,
“I am he, the one speaking to you.”
27 At that moment his disciples returned. Now they were wondering why he was
speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or “Why are you
speaking with her?” 28 So the woman left her water pot, went back to the town, andJohn 4:29
1115
John 5:9
said to the people, 29 “Come, see a man who told me everything that I have ever done.
This could not be the Christ, could it?” 30 They left the town and came to him. 31 In
the meantime, the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But he said to
them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” 33 So the disciples said to each
other, “No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?” 34 Jesus said to them,
“My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. 35 Do you
not say, 'There are four more months and then the harvest comes'? I am saying to
you, look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest! 36 He who is
harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that he who sows
and he who harvests may rejoice together. 37 For in this the saying, 'One sows, and
another harvests,' is true. 38 I sent you to harvest what you have not worked for.
Others have worked, and you have entered into their labor.”
39 Many of the Samaritans in that city believed in him because of the report of the
woman who was testifying, “He told me everything that I have done.” 40 So when the
Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two
days. 41 Many more believed because of his word. 42 They said to the woman, “We no
longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know
that this one is indeed the savior of the world.”
43 After those two days, he departed from there for Galilee. 44 For Jesus himself
declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country. 45 When he came into
Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all the things that he had done
in Jerusalem at the festival, for they had also gone to the festival.
46 Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. There
was a certain royal official whose son in Capernaum was ill. 47 When he heard that
Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and asked him to come down
and heal his son, who was about to die. 48 Jesus then said to him, “Unless you see
signs and wonders, you will not believe.” 49 The official said to him, “Sir, come down
before my child dies.” 50 Jesus said to him, “Go. Your son lives.” The man believed
the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went away. 51 While he was going down, his
servants met him, saying that his son was living. 52 So he asked them the hour when
he began to improve. They replied to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
left him.” 53 Then the father realized that it was at that hour that Jesus had said to
him, “Your son lives.” So he himself and his whole household believed. 54 This was
the second sign that Jesus did when he came out of Judea to Galilee.
5
1 After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2 Now in
Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda, and
it has five roofed porches. 3 A large number of people who were sick, blind, lame, or
paralyzed were lying there. * 4 † 5 A certain man was there who had been sick for
thirty-eight years. 6 When Jesus saw him lying there, and after he realized that he
had been there a long time, he said to him, “Do you want to be healthy?” 7 The sick
man replied, “Sir, I do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is
stirred up. When I come, another steps down before me.” 8 Jesus said to him, “Get
up, take up your bed, and walk.” 9 Immediately the man was healed, and he took up
his bed and walked.
* 5:3 The best ancient copies omit the phrase, waiting for the moving of the water .
† 5:4 The best ancient
copies omit vs. 4, For an angel of the Lord went down and stirred up the water at certain times and whoever
stepped in while the water was stirring was healed from whatever disease he suffered from .John 5:10
1116
John 5:45
Now that day was a Sabbath. 10 So the Jews said to him who was healed, “It is the
Sabbath and you are not permitted to carry your mat.” 11 He replied, “He who made
me healthy said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'” 12 They asked him, “Who is the
man that said to you, 'Pick it up and walk'?” 13 However, the one who was healed did
not know who it was because Jesus had gone away secretly, for there was a crowd
in the place. 14 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you
have become healthy! Do not sin anymore, so that something worse will not happen
to you.” 15 The man went away and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had
made him healthy. 16 Now because of these things the Jews persecuted Jesus, because
he did these things on the Sabbath. 17 Jesus replied to them, “My Father is working
even now, and I, too, am working.” 18 Because of this, the Jews sought even more to
kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father,
making himself equal to God.
19 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, the Son can do nothing of himself, except
only what he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father is doing, the Son does
these things also. 20 For the Father loves the Son and he shows him everything that
he himself does, and he will show him greater things than these so that you will be
amazed. 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives
life to whomever he wishes. 22 For the Father judges no one, but he has given all
judgment to the Son 23 so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the
Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
24 Truly, truly, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life
and will not be condemned, but he has passed from death to life. 25 Truly, truly, I tell
you the time is coming, and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of
God, and those who hear will live. 26 For just as the Father has life in himself, so he
has also given to the Son so that he has life in himself, 27 and the Father has given
the Son authority to carry out judgment because he is the Son of Man. 28 Do not be
amazed at this, for there is a time coming in which everyone who is in the tombs will
hear his voice 29 and will come out. Those who have done good to the resurrection
of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.
30 I can do nothing from myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous
because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me. 31 If I should
testify about myself, my testimony would not be true. 32 There is another who testifies
about me, and I know that the testimony that he gives about me is true. 33 You have
sent to John, and he has testified the truth. 34 But the testimony that I receive is not
from man. I say these things that you might be saved. 35 John was a lamp that was
burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice in his light for a while. 36 Yet
the testimony that I have is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father
has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me that the Father
has sent me. 37 The Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You have
neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time. 38 You do not have his word
remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent. 39 You
search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these
same scriptures testify about me, 40 and you are not willing to come to me so that
you may have life. 41 I do not receive praise from men, 42 but I know that you do not
have the love of God in yourselves. 43 I have come in my Father's name, and you do
not receive me. If another should come in his own name, you would receive him.
44 How can you believe, you who accept praise from one another but are not seeking
the praise that comes from the only God? 45 Do not think that I myself will accuse
you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have putJohn 5:46
1117
John 6:32
your hope. 46 If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about
me. 47 If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?”
6
1 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also
called the Sea of Tiberias. 2 A great crowd was following him because they saw the
signs that he was doing on those who were sick. 3 Jesus went up the mountain and
there he sat down with his disciples. 4 (Now the Passover, the Jewish festival, was
near.) 5 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him, he said to
Philip, “Where are we going to buy bread so that these may eat?” 6 (But Jesus said
this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.) 7 Philip answered
him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to
have even a little.” 8 One of the disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said
to Jesus, 9 “There is a boy here who has five bread loaves of barley and two fish, but
what are these among so many?” 10 Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” (Now
there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in
number. 11 Then Jesus took the loaves and after giving thanks, he gave it to those
who were sitting. He did the same with the fish, as much as they wanted. 12 When
the people were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces which
remain, so that nothing will be lost.” 13 So they gathered them up and filled twelve
baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves left over by those who had
eaten. 14 Then, when the people saw this sign that he did, they said, “This truly is
the prophet who is to come into the world.” 15 When Jesus realized that they were
about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the
mountain by himself.
16 When it became evening, his disciples went down to the sea. 17 They got into a
boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was dark by this time, and Jesus
had not yet come to them. 18 A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting
rough. 19 When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus
walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But he said
to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid.” 21 Then they were willing to receive him into the
boat, and immediately the boat reached the land where they were going.
22 The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw
that there was no other boat there except the one, and that Jesus had not entered
it with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone. 23 However, there
were some boats that came from Tiberias close to the place where they had eaten
the bread loaves after the Lord had given thanks. 24 When the crowd discovered that
neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and
went to Capernaum seeking Jesus. 25 After they found him on the other side of the
sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” 26 Jesus replied to them,
saying, “Truly, truly, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate
some of the bread loaves and were filled. 27 Do not work for the food that perishes,
but work for the food that endures to eternal life which the Son of Man will give you,
for God the Father has set his seal on him.” 28 Then they said to him, “What must we
do, so that we may do the works of God?” 29 Jesus replied and said to them, “This is
the work of God: That you believe in the one whom he has sent.” 30 So they said to
him, “What sign then will you do, so that we may see and believe you? What will you
do? 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, 'He gave them
bread from heaven to eat.'” 32 Then Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly, it was not
Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but it is my Father who is giving youJohn 6:33
1118
John 6:70
the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is that which comes down from
heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 So they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread
always.” 35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; he who comes to me will not be
hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But I told you that indeed
you have seen me, and you do not believe. 37 Everyone whom the Father gives me
will come to me, and he who comes to me I will certainly not throw out. 38 For I have
come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
39 This is the will of him who sent me, that I would lose not one of all those whom
he has given me, but will raise them up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of my
Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him would have eternal life
and I will raise him up on the last day.”
41 Then the Jews grumbled about him because he had said, “I am the bread that has
come down from heaven.” 42 They said, “Is not this Jesus son of Joseph, whose father
and mother we know? How then does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?”
43 Jesus replied and said to them, “Stop grumbling among yourselves. 44 No one can
come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the
last day. 45 It is written in the prophets, 'Everyone will be taught by God.' Everyone
who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. 46 Not that anyone has seen
the Father, except he who is from God—he has seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly, he who
believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in
the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread which comes down from heaven,
so that a person may eat some of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came
down from heaven. If anyone eats some of this bread, he will live forever. The bread
that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.”
52 The Jews became angry among themselves and began to argue, saying, “How can
this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, unless
you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in
yourselves. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and
I will raise him up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true
drink. 56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.
57 As the living Father sent me, and as I live because of the Father, so he who eats me,
he will also live because of me. 58 This is the bread that has come down from heaven,
not as the fathers ate and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.” 59 But Jesus
said these things in the synagogue while he was teaching in Capernaum.
60 Then many of his disciples who heard this said, “This is a difficult teaching; who
can accept it?” 61 Jesus, because he knew in himself that his disciples were grumbling
at this, said to them, “Does this offend you? 62 Then what if you should see the Son of
Man going up to where he was before? 63 It is the Spirit who makes alive; the flesh
profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.
64 Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning
who were the ones that would not believe and who it was who would betray him.
65 He said, “It is because of this that I said to you that no one can come to me unless
it is granted to him by the Father.”
66 Because of this, many of his disciples went away and no longer walked with him.
67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?” 68 Simon
Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life,
69 and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.” *
70 Jesus said to them, “Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?”
* 6:69
The phrase the Holy One of God is in the best ancient copies. Some later copies add an additional
description and they read: the Christ, the Holy One of God .John 6:71
1119
John 7:35
71 Now he spoke of Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he, one of the twelve, who
would betray Jesus.
7
1 After these things Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he did not want to go into
Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill him. 2 Now the Jewish Festival of Shelters
was near. 3 His brothers therefore said to him, “Leave this place and go to Judea, so
that your disciples also may see the works that you do. 4 No one does anything in
secret if he himself wants to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself
to the world.” 5 For even his brothers did not believe in him. 6 Jesus therefore said to
them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. 7 The world cannot
hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil. 8 You go
up to the festival; I am not going to this festival because my time has not yet been
fulfilled.” 9 After he said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.
10 But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not
publicly but in secret. 11 The Jews were looking for him at the festival and said,
“Where is he?” 12 There was much discussion among the crowds about him. Some
said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “No, he leads the crowds astray.” 13 Yet no one
spoke openly about him for fear of the Jews.
14 When the festival was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began
to teach. 15 Then the Jews marveled, saying, “How does this man know so much? He
has never been educated.” 16 Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not
mine, but is of him who sent me. 17 If anyone wishes to do his will, he will know
about this teaching, whether it comes from God, or whether I speak from myself.
18 Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but whoever seeks the glory of
him who sent him, that person is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 19 Did
not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill
me?” 20 The crowd answered, “You have a demon. Who seeks to kill you?” 21 Jesus
answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel because of it. 22 Moses
gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the ancestors), and on the
Sabbath you circumcise a man. 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so
that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I made a
man completely healthy on the Sabbath? 24 Do not judge according to appearance,
but judge righteously.”
25 Some of them from Jerusalem said, “Is not this the one they seek to kill? 26 See,
he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. It cannot be that the rulers indeed
know that this is the Christ, can it? 27 Yet we know where this one is from. But when
the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.” 28 Then Jesus cried out in the
temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me and know where I come from. I
have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, and you do not know him. 29 I
know him because I come from him and he sent me.” 30 They were trying to arrest
him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come. 31 But many
in the crowd believed in him, and they said, “When the Christ comes, will he do more
signs than what this one has done?” 32 The Pharisees heard the crowds whispering
these things about Jesus, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest
him. 33 Jesus then said, “I am still with you for a short amount of time, and then I go
to him who sent me. 34 You will seek me but you will not find me; where I go, you
will not be able to come.” 35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will
this man go that we will not be able to find him? Will he go to the dispersion amongJohn 7:36
1120
John 8:19
the Greeks and teach the Greeks? 36 What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me
but will not find me; where I go, you will not be able to come'?”
37 Now on the last, great day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If
anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. 38 He who believes in me, just as
the scripture says, rivers of living water will flow from his stomach.” 39 But he said
this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him would receive; the Spirit had
not yet been given because Jesus was not yet glorified. 40 Some of the crowd, when
they heard these words, said, “This is indeed the prophet.” 41 Others said, “This is the
Christ.” But some said, “Does the Christ come from Galilee? 42 Have the scriptures
not said that the Christ will come from the descendants of David and from Bethlehem,
the village where David was?” 43 So there arose a division in the crowds because of
him. 44 Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.
45 Then the officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them,
“Why did you not bring him?” 46 The officers answered, “Never has anyone spoken
like this.” 47 So the Pharisees answered them, “Have you also been deceived? 48 Have
any of the rulers believed in him, or any of the Pharisees? 49 But this crowd that does
not know the law, they are cursed.” 50 Nicodemus (one of the Pharisees, who came
to him earlier) said to them, 51 “Does our law judge a man before hearing from him
and knowing what he does?” 52 They answered and said to him, “Are you also from
Galilee? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee.”
53 * [Then everyone went to his own house.

1 * Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early in the morning he came to the temple
again, and all the people came; he sat down and taught them. 3 The scribes and the
Pharisees brought a woman caught in the act of adultery. They placed her in the
middle. 4 † Then they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act
of adultery. 5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such people; what do
you say about her?” 6 They said this in order to trap him so that they might have
something to accuse him about, but Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with
his finger. 7 ‡ When they continued asking him questions, he stood up and said to
them, “The one among you who has no sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at
her.” 8 Again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. 9 § When
they heard it, they left one by one, beginning with the oldest. Finally Jesus was left
alone, with the woman who had been in the middle. 10 Jesus stood up and said to
her, “Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?” 11 She said, “No
one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more.”]
12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world; he who follows
me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.” 13 The Pharisees said
to him, “You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.” 14 Jesus answered
and said to them, “Even if I bear witness about myself, my witness is true. I know
where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I came from
or where I am going. 15 You judge according the flesh; I judge no one. 16 Yet if I judge,
my judgment is true because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.
17 Yes, and in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true. 18 I am
he who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about
me.” 19 They said to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither

me nor my Father; if you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”
20 He said these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no one arrested
him because his hour had not yet come.
21 So again he said to them, “I am going away; you will seek me and will die in your
sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.” 22 The Jews said, “Will he kill himself?
Is that why he says, 'Where I am going you cannot come'?” 23 Jesus said to them,
“You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
24 Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that
I AM, you will die in your sins.” 25 They said therefore to him, “Who are you?” Jesus
said to them, “What I have said to you from the beginning. 26 I have many things to
speak and to judge about you. However, he who sent me is true; and the things that I
heard from him, these things I say to the world.” 27 They did not understand that he
was speaking to them about the Father. 28 Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the
Son of Man, then will you know that I AM, and that I do nothing of myself. As the
Father taught me, I speak these things. 29 He who sent me is with me, and he has not
left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.” 30 As Jesus was saying
these things, many believed in him.
31 Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then
you are truly my disciples; 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set
you free.” 33 They answered him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have never
been slaves of anyone; how can you say, 'You will be set free'?” 34 Jesus answered
them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. 35 The
slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. 36 Therefore,
if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free. 37 I know that you are Abraham's
descendants; you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you. 38 I say what I
have seen with my Father, and you also do what you heard from your father.” 39 They
answered and said to him, “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them, “If you were
Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham. 40 Yet, now you seek to
kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not
do this. 41 You do the works of your father.” They said to him, “We were not born
in sexual immorality; we have one Father: God.” 42 Jesus said to them, “If God were
your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and am here; for neither have
I come of myself, but he sent me. 43 Why do you not understand my words? It is
because you cannot hear my words. 44 You are of your father, the devil, and you wish
to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does
not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he
speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies. 45 Yet, because
I speak the truth, you do not believe me. 46 Which one of you convicts me of sin? If
I speak the truth, why do you not believe me? 47 He who is of God hears the words
of God; you do not hear them because you are not of God.” 48 The Jews answered
and said to him, “Do we not truly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”
49 Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor
me. 50 I do not seek my glory; there is one seeking and judging. 51 Truly, truly, I say
to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.” 52 The Jews said to him,
“Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died; but you
say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.' 53 You are not greater than
our father Abraham who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you make
yourself out to be?” 54 Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is
my Father who glorifies me—about whom you say that he is your God. 55 You have
not known him, but I know him. If I would say, 'I do not know him,' I would be likeJohn 8:56
1122
John 9:32
you, a liar. However, I know him and keep his word. 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced
at seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.” 57 The Jews said to him, “You are not yet
fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?” 58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I
say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” 59 Then they picked up stones to throw at
him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.

1 Now as Jesus passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 His disciples asked
him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?” 3 Jesus
answered, “Neither did this man sin, nor his parents, but so that the works of God
would be revealed in him. 4 We must work the works of him who sent me while it is
day. Night is coming when no one will be able to work. 5 While I am in the world,
I am the light of the world.” 6 After Jesus said these things, he spit on the ground,
made mud with the saliva, and smeared the mud on his eyes. 7 He said to him, “Go,
wash in the pool of Siloam,” (which is translated “Sent”). So the man went away,
washed, and came back seeing. 8 Then the man's neighbors and those who had seen
him previously as a beggar were saying, “Is not this the man that used to sit and
beg?” 9 Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “No, but he is like him.” But he said, “It is
me.” 10 They said to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” 11 He answered, “The
man who is called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, 'Go to
Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed, and I received my sight.” 12 They said to
him, “Where is he?” He replied, “I do not know.”
13 They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees. 14 Now it was
the Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. 15 Then again the
Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on
my eyes, I washed, and I now can see.” 16 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is
not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man
who is a sinner do such signs?” So there was a division among them. 17 So they asked
the blind man again, “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” The
blind man said, “He is a prophet.” 18 Now the Jews still did not believe about him
that he was blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of him who
had received his sight. 19 They asked the parents, “Is this your son whom you say
was born blind? How then does he now see?” 20 So his parents answered them, “We
know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 21 How he now sees, we do
not know, and who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him, he is an adult. He
can speak for himself.” 22 His parents said these things, because they were afraid of
the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him to be
the Christ, he would be thrown out of the synagogue. 23 Because of this, his parents
said, “He is an adult, ask him.” 24 So for a second time they called the man who had
been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”
25 Then that man replied, “I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I
was blind, and now I see.” 26 Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How
did he open your eyes?” 27 He answered, “I have told you already, and you did not
listen! Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples
too, do you? 28 They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples
of Moses. 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this
one is from.” 30 The man answered and said to them, “This is remarkable, that you
do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes. 31 We know that God
does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to
him. 32 Since the world began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyesJohn 9:33
1123
John 10:29
of a man born blind. 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” 34 They
answered and said to him, “You were completely born in sins, and you are teaching
us?” Then they threw him out.
35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out of the synagogue. He found him and said,
“Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 36 He replied and said, “Who is he, Lord, that
I may believe in him?” 37 Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and it is the one
who is speaking with you.” 38 The man said, “Lord, I believe” and he worshiped him.
39 Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world so that those who do not see may
see and so that those who see may become blind.” 40 Some of the Pharisees who
were with him heard these things and asked him, “Are we also blind?” 41 Jesus said
to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin, but now you say, 'We see,' so
your sin remains.”

1 “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter through the gate into the sheep
pen, but climbs up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber. 2 He who enters
through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 The gatekeeper opens for him. The
sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 When
he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, for
they know his voice. 5 They will not follow a stranger but instead they will avoid him,
for they do not know the voice of strangers.” 6 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but
they did not understand what these things were that he was saying to them.
7 Then Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the gate of the
sheep. 8 Everyone who came before me is a thief and a robber, but the sheep did
not listen to them. 9 I am the gate. If anyone enters in through me, he will be saved;
he will go in and out and will find pasture. 10 The thief does not come if he would
not steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they will have life and have it
abundantly. 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep. 12 The hired servant is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep. He sees
the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and escapes, and the wolf carries them off
and scatters them. 13 He runs away because he is a hired servant and does not care
for the sheep. 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me.
15 The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
16 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also, and they
will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd. 17 This is why
the Father loves me: I lay down my life so that I may take it again. 18 No one takes
it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I
have authority to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”
19 A division again occurred among the Jews because of these words. 20 Many of
them said, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?” 21 Others said,
“These are not the words of a demon-possessed man. Can a demon open the eyes of
the blind?”
22 Then it was time for the Festival of the Dedication in Jerusalem. 23 It was winter,
and Jesus was walking in the temple in the porch of Solomon. 24 Then the Jews
surrounded him and said to him, “How long will you hold us doubting? If you are
the Christ, tell us openly.” 25 Jesus replied to them, “I told you, but you do not believe.
The works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me. 26 Yet you
do not believe because you are not my sheep. 27 My sheep hear my voice; I know
them, and they follow me. 28 I give them eternal life; they will never die, and no one
will snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greaterJohn 10:30
1124
John 11:27
than all others, and no one is able to snatch them out of the hand of the Father. 30 I
and the Father are one.” 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus
answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of
those works are you stoning me?” 33 The Jews answered him, “We are not stoning
you for any good work, but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are making yourself
God.” 34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, 'I said, “You are gods”'?
35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot
be broken), 36 do you say to him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world,
'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? 37 If I am not doing the
works of my Father, do not believe me. 38 But if I am doing them, even if you do
not believe me, believe in the works so that you may know and understand that the
Father is in me and that I am in the Father.” 39 They tried to seize him again, but he
went away out of their hand.
40 He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John had first been
baptizing, and he stayed there. 41 Many people came to him and they said, “John
indeed did no signs, but all the things that John has said about this man are true.”
42 Many people believed in him there.
11
1 Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of
Mary and her sister Martha. 2 It was Mary who anointed the Lord with myrrh and
wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 3 The sisters then sent
for Jesus, saying, “Lord, see, he whom you love is sick.” 4 When Jesus heard it, he
said, “This sickness is not to death, but instead it is for the glory of God so that the Son
of God may be glorified by it.” 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
6 So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, Jesus stayed two more days in the place
where he was. 7 Then after this, he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”
8 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, right now the Jews are trying to stone you, and
you are going back there again?” 9 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of
light in a day? If someone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees
by the light of this world. 10 However, if he walks at night, he will stumble because
the light is not in him.” 11 He said these things, and after these things, he said to
them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may wake him
out of sleep.” 12 The disciples therefore said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep,
he will recover.” 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he was
speaking about the sleep of resting. 14 Then Jesus said to them plainly, “Lazarus is
dead. 15 I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there so that you may believe. Let
us go to him.” 16 Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let
us also go so that we may die with Jesus.”
17 When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four
days. 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away. 19 Many of the
Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them about their brother. 20 Then
Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was
sitting in the house. 21 Martha then said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my
brother would not have died. 22 Even now, I know that whatever you ask from God,
he will give to you.” 23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha said
to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” 25 Jesus
said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, even if he dies,
will live; 26 and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, whoJohn 11:28
1125
John 12:2
is coming into the world.” 28 When she had said this, she went away and called her
sister Mary privately. She said, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” 29 When
she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come
into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him. 31 So when
the Jews, who were with her in the house and who were comforting her, saw Mary
getting up quickly and going out, they followed her, thinking that she was going to the
tomb to weep there. 32 When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him,
she fell down at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother
would not have died.” 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with
her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and was troubled; 34 he said,
“Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept.
36 Then the Jews said, “See how much he loved Lazarus!” 37 But some of them said,
“Could not this man, who opened the eyes of a blind man, also have made this man
not die?” 38 Then Jesus again, being deeply moved in himself, went to the tomb. Now
it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha,
the sister of Lazarus, the one who had died, said to Jesus, “Lord, by this time the
body will be decaying, for he has been dead for four days.” 40 Jesus said to her, “Did
I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 41 So they
took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you
listened to me. 42 I knew that you always listen to me, but it is because of the crowd
that is standing around me that I said this, so that they may believe that you have
sent me.” 43 After he had said this, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come
out!” 44 The dead man came out; his feet and hands were bound with cloths, and his
face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”
45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in
him. 46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that
Jesus had done.
47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council together and said,
“What will we do? This man does many signs. 48 If we leave him alone like this, all
will believe in him; the Romans will come and take away both our place and our
nation.” 49 However, a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that
year, said to them, “You know nothing. 50 You do not consider that it is better for
you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes.” 51 Now
this he said not from himself. Instead, being high priest that year, he prophesied that
Jesus should die for the nation; 52 and not only for the nation, but so that the children
of God who are scattered would be gathered together into one. 53 So from that day
onward they planned how to put Jesus to death.
54 No longer did Jesus walk openly among the Jews, but he departed from there
into the country near to the wilderness into a town called Ephraim. There he stayed
with the disciples. 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up
to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.
56 They were looking for Jesus, and speaking one with another as they stood in the
temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?” 57 Now the chief
priests and the Pharisees had given an order that if anyone knew where Jesus was,
he should report it so that they might seize him.
12
1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom Jesus
had raised from the dead, was. 2 So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was
serving, but Lazarus was one of those who was lying down at the table with Jesus.John 12:3
1126
John 12:38
3 Then Mary took a litra of perfume made of very precious pure nard, anointed the
feet of Jesus with it, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the
fragrance of the perfume. 4 Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would
betray him, said, 5 “Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and
given to the poor?” 6 Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but
because he was a thief. He had the moneybag and would steal from what was put in
it. 7 Jesus said, “Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial. 8 You will
always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me.”
9 Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not
only for Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 10 The
chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death; 11 for it
was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
12 On the next day a great crowd came to the festival. When they heard that Jesus
was coming to Jerusalem, 13 they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to
meet him and cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,
the King of Israel.” 14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it was written,
15 “Do not fear, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a
donkey.” 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was
glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that
they had done these things to him. 17 Now the crowd testified that they had been with
him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead. 18 It
was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard
that he had done this sign. 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, “Look,
you can do nothing; see, the world has gone after him.”
20 Now certain Greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the
festival. 21 These went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him,
saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 22 Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went
with Philip, and they told Jesus. 23 Jesus answered them and said, “The hour has
come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain
of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it will
bear much fruit. 25 He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this
world will keep it for eternal life. 26 If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and
where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor
him. 27 Now my soul is troubled and what should I say? 'Father, save me from this
hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour. 28 Father, glorify your name.” Then
a voice came from heaven and said, “I have glorified it and I will glorify it again.”
29 Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said,
“An angel has spoken to him.” 30 Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not come
for me, but for you. 31 Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the ruler of this
world be thrown out. 32 When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone
to myself.” 33 He said this to indicate what kind of death he would die. 34 The crowd
answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ will stay forever. How
can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?” 35 Jesus
then said to them, “The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk
while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in
the darkness does not know where he is going. 36 While you have the light, believe
in the light so that you may be sons of light.”
Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them. 37 Although Jesus
had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him 38 so that the
word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled, in which he said:John 12:39
1127
John 13:19
“Lord, who has believed our report,
and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
39 For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah had also said,
40 “He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts;
otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand with their hearts,
and turn,
and I would heal them.”
41 Isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke of him. 42 But
despite that, many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they
did not admit it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue. 43 They loved
the praise that comes from people more than the praise that comes from God.
44 Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me, believes not only in me
but also in him who sent me, 45 and the one who sees me sees him who sent me. 46 I
have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in me may not remain
in the darkness. 47 If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge
him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 The one who
rejects me and who does not receive my words, has one who judges him. The word
I have spoken will judge him on the last day. 49 For I did not speak for myself, but it
is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what to say and
what to speak. 50 I know that his command is eternal life, so that is what I say—just
as the Father has spoken to me, so I speak.”

1 Now it was before the Festival of the Passover. Jesus knew that his hour had come
to go out of this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end. 2 Now the devil had already put it into the heart
of Judas Iscariot son of Simon, to betray Jesus. 3 He knew that the Father had given
everything over into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back
to God. 4 He got up from dinner and took off his outer clothing. Then he took a towel
and wrapped it around himself. 5 Then he poured water into a basin and began to
wash the feet of the disciples and dry them with the towel that he had put around
himself. 6 He came to Simon Peter, and Peter said to him, “Lord, are you going to
wash my feet?” 7 Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not
understand now, but you will understand this later.” 8 Peter said to him, “You will
never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share
with me.” 9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, do not only wash my feet, but also my
hands and my head.” 10 Jesus said to him, “He who is bathed has no need, except to
wash his feet, but he is completely clean; you are clean, but not everyone.” 11 (For
Jesus knew who would betray him; that is why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”)
12 So when Jesus had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again,
he said to them, “Do you know what I have done for you? 13 You call me 'teacher' and
'Lord,' and you are speaking correctly, because so I am. 14 If I then, the Lord and the
Teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash the feet of one another. 15 For
I have given you an example so that you should also do just as I did for you. 16 Truly,
truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is a messenger greater
than he who sent him. 17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
18 I am not speaking about all of you; I know those whom I have chosen—but this so
that the scripture will be fulfilled: 'He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against
me.' 19 I tell you this now before it happens so that when it happens, you may believeJohn 13:20
1128
John 14:17
that I AM. 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I sent, receives me,
and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”
21 When Jesus said this, he was troubled in spirit. He testified and said, “Truly, truly,
I say to you that one of you will betray me.” 22 The disciples looked at each other,
wondering of whom he was speaking. 23 One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was
lying down at the table against Jesus' side. 24 Simon Peter motioned to this disciple
and said, “Ask him who he is speaking about.” 25 So he leaned back against the side
of Jesus and said to him, “Lord, who is it?” 26 Then Jesus answered, “It is the one
for whom I will dip the piece of bread and give it him.” So when he had dipped
the bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 27 Then after the bread, Satan
entered into him, so Jesus said to him, “What you are doing, do it quickly.” 28 Now no
one who was lying down at the table knew why he said this to him. 29 Some thought
that, since Judas had the moneybag, Jesus said to him, “Buy what we need to have
for the festival,” or that he should give something to the poor. 30 After Judas received
the bread, he went out immediately. It was night.
31 When Judas was gone, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God
is glorified in him. 32 God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him
immediately. 33 Little children, I am with you for still a short amount of time. You
will look for me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' Now
I also say this to you. 34 I am giving you a new commandment, that you should love
one another; as I have loved you, so also you should love one another. 35 By this
everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.”
36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “Where
I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.” 37 Peter said to
him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” 38 Jesus
answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster
will not crow before you have denied me three times.”
14
1 “Do not let your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In the
house of my Father are many rooms. If it were not so, I would have told you, for I
am going to prepare a place for you. 3 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
again and receive you to myself, so that where I am you will also be. 4 You know the
way to where I am going.” 5 Thomas said to Jesus, “Lord, we do not know where you
are going, how can we know the way?” 6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth,
and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you had known me,
you would have known my Father also. From now on you know him and have seen
him.” 8 Philip said to Jesus, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for
us.” 9 Jesus said to him, “I have been with you for so long and you still do not know
me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the
Father'? 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The
words that I say to you I do not speak from my own authority, but the Father living in
me is doing his work. 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me,
or else believe because of the works themselves. 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who
believes in me will do the works that I do, and he will do greater works than these
because I am going to the Father. 13 Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that
the Father will be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask me anything in my name, I will
do it. 15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments, 16 and I will pray to the
Father, and he will give you another Comforter so that he will be with you forever—
17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him orJohn 14:18
1129
John 15:19
know him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not
leave you alone; I will come back to you. 19 Yet a short amount of time and the world
will no longer see me, but you see me. Because I live, you will also live. 20 On that
day you will know that I am in my Father, and that you are in me, and that I am in
you. 21 He who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me,
and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and I will show
myself to him.” 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Jesus, “Lord, why is it that you will show
yourself to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone
loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him
and we will make our home with him. 24 He who does not love me does not keep my
words. The word that you hear is not from me but from the Father who sent me.
25 I have said these things to you, while I am staying with you. 26 However, the
Comforter—the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name—he will teach
you everything and he will remind you of everything that I said to you. 27 I leave
you peace; I give you my peace. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your
heart be troubled, and do not be afraid. 28 You heard that I said to you, 'I am going
away, and I will come back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad because I
am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am. 29 Now I have told you
before it happens so that, when it happens, you will believe. 30 I will no longer speak
much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,
31 but in order that the world will know that I love the Father, I do just as the Father
commanded me. Let us get up and go from here.”

1 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. 2 He takes away every branch
in me that does not bear fruit, and he prunes every branch that bears fruit so that
it will bear more fruit. 3 You are already clean because of the message that I have
spoken to you. 4 Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by
itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. 5 I
am the vine, you are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, he bears
much fruit, for without me you can do nothing. 6 If anyone does not remain in me,
he is thrown away like a branch and dries up, and they gather the branches and
throw them into the fire, and they are burned up. 7 If you remain in me, and if
my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8 My
Father is glorified in this, that you bear much fruit and so prove that you are my
disciples. 9 As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in my love.
10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, as I have kept the
commandments of my Father and remain in his love. 11 I have spoken these things
to you so that my joy will be in you and so that your joy will be complete. 12 This
is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13 No one has
greater love than this—that he lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends
if you do the things that I command you. 15 No longer do I call you servants, for
the servant does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, for
everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you. 16 You did not
choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you would go and bear fruit,
and that your fruit should remain. This is so that whatever you ask of the Father in
my name, he will give it to you. 17 These things I command you, so that you love one
another. 18 If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If
you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. But because you are not
of the world and because I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.John 15:20
1130
John 16:24
20 Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.'
If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will
also keep yours. 21 They will do all these things to you because of my name, because
they do not know him who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they
would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. 23 He who hates me
also hates my Father. 24 If I had not done the works that no one else did among them,
they would have no sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
25 But this is in order to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me
without a cause.' 26 When the Comforter—whom I will send to you from the Father,
that is, the Spirit of truth, who goes out from the Father—comes, he will testify about
me. 27 You are also testifying because you have been with me from the beginning.
16
1 “I have spoken these things to you so that you will not fall away. 2 They will throw
you out of the synagogues. But the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will
think that he is offering a service to God. 3 They will do these things because they
have not known the Father nor me. 4 I have spoken these things to you so that when
their hour comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you
about these things in the beginning, because I was with you. 5 But now I go to him
who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' 6 But because I have
said these things to you, sadness has filled your heart. 7 But truly I tell you, it is better
for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you,
but if I go, I will send him to you. 8 When he comes, the Comforter will prove the
world to be wrong about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment— 9 about sin,
because they do not believe in me; 10 about righteousness, because I am going to the
Father, and you will no longer see me; 11 and about judgment, because the ruler of
this world has been judged. 12 I have many things to say to you, but you would not
understand them now. 13 But when he, the Spirit of Truth, comes, he will guide you
into all the truth, for he will not speak from himself. But he will say whatever he
hears, and he will tell you things that are to come. 14 He will glorify me, because he
will take from what is mine and he will tell it to you. 15 Everything that the Father has
is mine. Therefore, I said that the Spirit will take from what is mine and he will tell
it to you. 16 In a short amount of time you will no longer see me, and after another
short amount of time you will see me.” 17 Then some of his disciples said to one
another, “What is this that he says to us, 'A short amount of time you will no longer
see me and after another short amount of time you will see me,' and, 'Because I go
to the Father'?” 18 Therefore they said, “What is this that he says, 'A short amount of
time'? We do not know what he is talking about.” 19 Jesus saw that they wanted to
ask him, and he said to them, “Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant
by saying, 'A little while and you will no longer see me, and again a little while and
you will see me'? 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world
will be glad. You will become full of sadness, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
21 When a woman gives birth she has sadness because her hour has come, but when
she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers her pain because of her
joy that a man has been born into the world. 22 So you have sadness now, but I will
see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one will be able to take away your
joy from you. 23 On that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you,
if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. 24 Until now you
have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you will receive so that your joy will
be fulfilled.John 16:25
1131
John 17:25
25 I have said these things to you in figures of speech, but the hour is coming when
I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but instead I will tell you plainly
about the Father. 26 On that day you will ask in my name and I do not say to you that
I will pray to the Father for you, 27 for the Father himself loves you because you have
loved me and because you have believed that I came from the Father. 28 I came from
the Father, and I have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and I am
going to the Father.” 29 His disciples said, “See, now you are speaking plainly and you
are not using figures of speech. 30 Now we know that you know all things, and you
do not need anyone to ask you questions. Because of this, we believe that you have
come from God.” 31 Jesus answered them, “Do you believe now? 32 See, the hour is
coming, yes, and has indeed come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own
home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.
33 I have spoken these things to you so that you will have peace in me. In the world
you have troubles, but have courage, I have conquered the world.”
17
1 After Jesus said these things, he lifted up his eyes to the heavens and said, “Father,
the hour has come, glorify your Son so that the Son will glorify you— 2 just as you
gave him authority over all flesh so that he would give eternal life to everyone whom
you have given him. 3 This is eternal life: That they know you, the only true God, and
him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. 4 I glorified you on the earth. I have finished the
work that you have given me to do. 5 Now, Father, glorify me along with yourself with
the glory that I had with you before the world was made. 6 I revealed your name to
the people whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them
to me, and they have kept your word. 7 Now they know that everything that you have
given me comes from you, 8 for I have given them all the words that you gave me.
They received them and truly knew that I came from you, and they believed that you
sent me. 9 I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom you have
given me, for they are yours. 10 Everything that is mine is yours, and yours is mine,
and I am glorified in them. 11 I am no longer in the world, but these people are in
the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you
have given me so that they will be one, just as we are one. 12 While I was with them,
I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I protected them, and not one
of them was destroyed, except for the son of destruction, so that the scriptures would
be fulfilled. 13 Now I am coming to you, but I am saying these things in the world so
that they will have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 14 I have given them your word,
and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of
the world. 15 I do not ask for you to take them away from the world, but for you to
keep them from the evil one. 16 They are not of the world, just as I am not of the
world. 17 Set them apart by the truth. Your word is truth. 18 Just as you sent me into
the world, so I have sent them into the world. 19 For their sakes I have set myself
apart, so that they themselves may also be set apart in truth. 20 I pray not only for
these, but also for those who will believe in me through their word 21 so that they
will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I am in you. May they also be in us
so that the world will believe that you have sent me. 22 The glory that you gave me, I
have given to them, so that they will be one, just as we are one: 23 I in them, and you
in me—that they may be brought to complete unity, so that the world will know that
you sent me, and that you have loved them just as you loved me. 24 Father, I want
those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory
you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world. 25 RighteousJohn 17:26
1132
John 18:28
Father, the world did not know you, but I know you; and these know that you sent
me. 26 I made your name known to them, and I will make it known so that the love
with which you have loved me will be in them, and I will be in them.”
18
1 After Jesus spoke these words, he went out with his disciples to the other side of
the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.
2 Now Judas, who was going to betray him, also knew the place, for Jesus often went
there with his disciples. 3 Then Judas, leading a group of soldiers and some officers
from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
4 Then Jesus, who knew all the things that were happening to him, went forward and
asked them, “Who are you looking for?” 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
Jesus said to them, “I am.” Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with the
soldiers. 6 So when he said to them, “I am,” they went backward and fell to the
ground. 7 Then again he asked them, “Who are you looking for?” Again they said,
“Jesus of Nazareth.” 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am. So if you are looking for
me, let these go.” 9 This was in order to fulfill the word that he said: “Of those whom
you have given me, I lost no one.” 10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it
and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. Now the name of
the servant was Malchus. 11 Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword back into its sheath.
Should I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”
12 So the group of soldiers and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus
and tied him up. 13 They led him first to Annas, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas,
who was high priest that year. 14 Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice
to the Jews that it would be better that one man die for the people.
15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was
known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high
priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who
was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the female doorkeeper and he
brought Peter in. 17 Then the female servant, the doorkeeper, said to Peter, “Are you
not also one of the disciples of this man?” He said, “I am not.” 18 Now the servants
and the officers were standing there, and they had made a charcoal fire, for it was
cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was also with them, standing there
and warming himself.
19 The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. 20 Jesus
answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I was always teaching in
synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews come together. I said nothing
in secret. 21 Why did you ask me? Ask those who have heard me about what I
said. Look, these people know what I said.” 22 When Jesus had said this, one of
the officers standing there struck Jesus and said, “Is that how you answer the high
priest?” 23 Jesus answered him, “If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if
rightly, why do you hit me?” 24 Then Annas sent him tied up to Caiaphas the high
priest.
25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. The people then said to
him, “Are you not also one of his disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” 26 One
of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had
cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” 27 Peter then denied again,
and immediately the rooster crowed.
28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the government headquarters. It was early
in the morning, and they did not enter the government headquarters so that theyJohn 18:29
1133
John 19:18
would not be defiled but would eat the Passover. 29 So Pilate went out to them and
said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?” 30 They answered and
said to him, “If this man was not an evildoer, we would not have given him over to
you.” 31 Pilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according
to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.”
32 They said this so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled which he had spoken to
indicate by what kind of death he would die.
33 Then Pilate entered the government headquarters again and called Jesus and he
said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 34 Jesus answered, “Do you speak from
yourself, or did others speak to you about me?” 35 Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew,
am I? Your own people and the chief priests gave you over to me. What did you do?”
36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were part of
this world, then my servants would fight so that I would not be given over to the
Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.” 37 Pilate then said to him, “Are you a
king then?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been
born, and for this purpose I have come into the world, so that I would bear witness
to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.” 38 Pilate said
to him, “What is truth?” When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and
said to them, “I find no guilt in this man. 39 But you have the custom that I release
one person to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release the King of the Jews
to you?” 40 Then they cried out again and said, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Now
Barabbas was a robber.
19
1 Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him. 2 The soldiers weaved a crown of thorns.
They put it on the head of Jesus and dressed him with a purple garment. 3 They came
to him and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they struck him. 4 Then Pilate went
outside again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him outside to you so that you
will know that I find no guilt in him.” 5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of
thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, “Look, here is the man!” 6 When
therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they cried out and said, “Crucify
him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I
find no guilt in him.” 7 The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to that
law he has to die because he claimed to be the Son of God.” 8 When Pilate heard this
statement, he was even more afraid, 9 and he entered the government headquarters
again and said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.
10 Then Pilate said to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I
have power to release you, and power to crucify you?” 11 Jesus answered him, “You
do not have any power over me except for what has been given to you from above.
Therefore, he who gave me over to you has a greater sin.” 12 At this answer, Pilate
tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you are
not a friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment
seat in a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.” 14 Now it was the
day of preparation for the Passover, at about the sixth hour. Pilate said to the Jews,
“See, here is your king!” 15 They cried out, “Away with him, away with him; crucify
him!” Pilate said to them, “Should I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered,
“We have no king but Caesar.” 16 Then Pilate gave Jesus over to them to be crucified.
17 Then they took Jesus, and he went out, carrying the cross for himself, to the place
called “The Place of a Skull,” which in Hebrew is called “Golgotha.” 18 They crucifiedJohn 19:19
1134
John 20:2
Jesus there, and with him two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
19 Pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the cross. There it was written: JESUS OF
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 20 Many of the Jews read this sign because the
place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. The sign was written in Hebrew, in
Latin, and in Greek. 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write,
'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This one said, “I am King of the Jews.”'” 22 Pilate
answered, “What I have written I have written.”
23 When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, divided them into four
shares, one for each of them; and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven
in one piece from the top. 24 Then they said to each other, “Let us not tear it, but
instead let us cast lots for it to decide whose it will be.” This happened so that the
scripture would be fulfilled which said,
“They divided my garments among themselves
and cast lots for my clothing.”
This is what the soldiers did. 25 Now standing beside Jesus' cross were his mother,
his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus saw
his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother,
“Woman, see, your son!” 27 Then he said to the disciple, “See, your mother!” From
that hour the disciple took her to his own home.
28 After this, knowing that everything was now completed and so that the scriptures
would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” 29 A container full of sour wine was
placed there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop staff and lifted it
up to his mouth. 30 When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, “It is finished.” He
bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
31 Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, and so that the bodies
would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was especially
important), asked Pilate to break their legs and to remove them. 32 Then the soldiers
came and broke the legs of the first man and of the second man who had been
crucified with Jesus. 33 When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead,
so they did not break his legs. 34 However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with
a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 35 The one who saw this has
testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that what he said is true so that you
would also believe. 36 For these things happened in order to fulfill scripture, “Not one
of his bones will be broken.” 37 Again, another scripture says, “They will look at him
whom they pierced.”
38 After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, since he was a disciple of Jesus (but
secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus.
Pilate gave him permission. So Joseph came and took away his body. 39 Nicodemus
also came, he who at first had come to Jesus by night. He brought a mixture of myrrh
and aloes, about one hundred litras in weight. 40 So they took the body of Jesus and
wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, as was the custom of the Jews to bury
bodies. 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the
garden was a new tomb in which no person had yet been buried. 42 Because it was
the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus
in it.
20
1 Now early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene
came to the tomb and she saw the stone rolled away from the tomb. 2 So she ran
and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and she saidJohn 20:3
1135
John 21:1
to them, “They took away the Lord out from the tomb, and we do not know where
they have laid him.” 3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went to
the tomb. 4 They both ran together, and the other disciple quickly ran ahead of Peter
and arrived at the tomb first. 5 Then stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying
there, but he did not go inside. 6 Simon Peter then arrived after him and went into
the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there 7 and the cloth that had been on his
head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a place by itself.
8 Then the other disciple, the one who first arrived at the tomb, also went in, and he
saw and believed. 9 For until that time they still did not know the scripture that he
should rise from the dead. 10 So the disciples went back home again.
11 But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she stooped down
into the tomb. 12 She saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the
foot of where the body of Jesus had lain. 13 They said to her, “Woman, why are you
weeping?” She said to them, “Because they took away my Lord, and I do not know
where they have put him.” 14 When she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus
standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman,
why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She thought that he was the
gardener, so she said to him, “Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you
have put him, and I will take him away.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned, and
said to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”). 17 Jesus said to her, “Do
not touch me, for I have not yet gone up to the Father, but go to my brothers and say
to them that I will go up to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.”
18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he
had said these things to her.
19 When it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of
where the disciples were, were closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in
the middle of them and said to them, “Peace to you.” 20 After he said this, he showed
them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus
then said to them again, “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, so I am sending
you.” 22 When Jesus had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive
the Holy Spirit. 23 Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven; whoever's sins you
keep back, they are kept back.”
24 Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
25 The other disciples later said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” He said to them,
“Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of
the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
26 After eight days his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Jesus
came while the doors were closed, and stood among them, and said, “Peace to you.”
27 Then he said to Thomas, “Reach here with your finger and see my hands. Reach
here with your hand and put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving, but believe.”
28 Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God.” 29 Jesus said to him,
“Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen,
and believed.”
30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, signs that have
not been written in this book, 31 but these have been written so that you would believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in
his name.
21
1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias.John 21:2
1136
John 21:25
This is how he showed himself: 2 Simon Peter was together with Thomas called
Didymus, Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples
of Jesus. 3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We, too,
will come with you.” They went and got into a boat, but they caught nothing during
the whole night. 4 Now, when it was already early in the morning, Jesus stood on the
beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus. 5 So Jesus said to them, “Young
men, do you have anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.” 6 He said to them,
“Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they threw
their net and were not able to draw it in because of the large number of fish. 7 Then
the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” When Simon Peter heard
that it was the Lord, he tied up his outer garment (for he was undressed), and threw
himself into the sea. 8 The other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far
from the land, about two hundred cubits off), and they were pulling the net full of
fish. 9 When they got out upon the land, they saw a charcoal fire there and fish laid
on it, with bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just
caught.” 11 Simon Peter then went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish; 153.
There were so many, but the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat
breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was
the Lord. 13 Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish also. 14 This
was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from
the dead.
15 After they ate breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you
love me more than these?” Peter said to him, “Yes Lord, you know that I love you.”
Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.” 16 He said to him again a second time, “Simon
son of John, do you love me?” Peter said to him, “Yes Lord, you know that I love
you.” Jesus said to him, “Take care of my sheep.”
17 He said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was
sad because Jesus had said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” He said to him,
“Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my
sheep. 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to clothe yourself
and walk wherever you wanted, but when you become old, you will stretch out your
hands, and someone else will clothe you and carry you where you will not want to
go.” 19 Now Jesus said this in order to indicate with what kind of death Peter would
glorify God. After he had said this, he said to Peter, “Follow me.” 20 Peter turned
around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had also
leaned back against the side of Jesus at the dinner and who had said, “Lord, who is
the one who will betray you?” 21 Peter saw him and then said to Jesus, “Lord, what
will this man do?” 22 Jesus said to him, “If I want him to stay until I come, what is
that to you? Follow me.” 23 So this statement spread among the brothers, that that
disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to Peter that the other disciple would not
die, but, “If I want him to stay until I come, what is that to you?”
24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and who wrote these things,
and we know that his testimony is true. 25 There are also many other things that
Jesus did. If each one were written down, I suppose that even the world itself could
not contain the books that would be written.Acts 1:1
1137
Acts 1:26
Acts
1 The former book I wrote, Theophilus, told all that Jesus began to do and to teach,
2 until the day that he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy
Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he presented himself alive
to them with many convincing proofs. For forty days he appeared to them, and he
spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 When he was meeting together with them, he
commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father,
about which, he said, “You heard from me 5 that John indeed baptized with water,
but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days.”
6 When they were assembled together they asked him, “Lord, is this the time you
will restore the kingdom to Israel?” 7 He said to them, “It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons which the Father has determined by his own authority. 8 But
you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my
witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the
earth.” 9 When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was
raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes. 10 While they were looking intensely
to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing. 11 They
said, “You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus
who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same manner as you
saw him going into heaven.”
12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near to
Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey. 13 When they arrived, they went up into the
upper chamber, where they were staying. They were Peter, John, James, Andrew,
Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,
and Judas son of James. 14 They were all united as one, as they diligently continued
in prayer. Included were the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
15 In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers, about 120 people, and
said, 16 “Brothers, it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled, that the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who guided the ones
who arrested Jesus. 17 For he was one of us and received his share of the benefits of
this ministry.” 18 (Now this man bought a field with the earnings he received for his
wickedness, and there he fell headfirst, and his body burst open, and all his intestines
poured out. 19 All those living in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field
in their language “Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”) 20 “For it is written in the
Book of Psalms,
'Let his field be made desolate,
and do not let even one person live there';
'Let someone else take his position of leadership.'
21 It is necessary, therefore, that one of the men who accompanied us all the time the
Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 22 beginning from the baptism of John to the
day that he was taken up from us, must be a witness with us of his resurrection.”
23 They put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also named Justus,
and Matthias. 24 They prayed and said, “You, Lord, know the hearts of all people, so
reveal which of these two is the one whom you have chosen 25 to take the place in
this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.”
26 They cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was numbered with the
eleven apostles.Acts 2:1
1 When
1138
2
Acts 2:28
the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in the same place.
2 Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and
it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 3 There appeared to them tongues
like fire that were distributed, and they sat upon each one of them. 4 They were all
filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave
them to speak.
5 Now there were Jews who were living in Jerusalem, godly men, from every nation
under heaven. 6 When this sound was heard, the multitude came together and
was confused because everyone heard them speaking in his own language. 7 They
were amazed and marveled; they said, “Really, are not all these who are speaking
Galileans? 8 Why is it that we are hearing them, each in our own language in which we
were born? 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those who live in Mesopotamia,
in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and
the parts of Libya toward Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, 11 Jews and proselytes,
Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our languages about the mighty works
of God.” 12 They were all amazed and perplexed; they said to one another, “What
does this mean?” 13 But others mocked and said, “They are full of new wine.”
14 But Peter stood with the eleven, raised his voice, and said to them, “Men of Judea
and all of you who live at Jerusalem, let this be known to you; pay attention to my
words. 15 For these people are not drunk as you assume, for it is only the third hour
of the day. 16 But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
17 'It will be in the last days,' God says,
'I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
your young men will see visions,
and your old men will dream dreams.
18 Also on my servants and my female servants in those days
I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
19 I will show wonders in the sky above
and signs on the earth below,
blood, fire, and vapor of smoke.
20 The sun will be turned to darkness
and the moon to blood,
before the great and remarkable day of the Lord comes.
21 It will be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man accredited to you by God
by the mighty deeds, the wonders, and the signs which God did through him in your
midst, as you yourselves know. 23 This man was handed over by God's predetermined
plan and foreknowledge; and you, by the hand of lawless men, put him to death by
nailing him to a cross. 24 But God raised him up, freeing him from the pains of death,
because it was impossible for him to be held by it. 25 For David says about him,
'I saw the Lord always before my face,
for he is beside my right hand so that I should not be moved.
26 Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced.
Also, my flesh will live in certain hope.
27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,
neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
28 You revealed to me the ways of life;
you will make me full of gladness with your face.'Acts 2:29
1139
Acts 3:12
29 Brothers, I can speak to you confidently about the patriarch David, he both died
and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 30 Therefore, he was a prophet
and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him, that he would set one of the fruit
of his body upon his throne. 31 He saw what was to happen in the future and spoke
about the resurrection of the Christ,
'He was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.'
32 This Jesus—God raised him up, of which we all are witnesses. 33 Therefore having
been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promised Holy Spirit
from the Father, he has poured out what you see and hear.
34 For David did not ascend to the heaven, but he says,
'The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,
35 until I make your enemies the stool for your feet.”'
36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel certainly know that God has made him both
Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
37 Now when they heard this, they were pierced in their hearts, and said to Peter
and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” 38 Then Peter said to them,
“Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness
of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is
to you and to your children and to all that are far off, as many people as the Lord
our God will call.” 40 With many other words he testified and urged them; he said,
“Save yourselves from this wicked generation.” 41 Then they received his word and
were baptized, and there were added in that day about three thousand souls. 42 They
continued in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in
prayers.
43 Fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through
the apostles. 44 All who believed were together and had all things in common, 45 and
they sold their property and possessions and distributed them to all, according to the
needs anyone had. 46 So day after day they continued with one purpose in the temple,
and they broke bread in homes, and they shared food with glad and humble hearts,
47 praising God and having favor with all the people, and every day the Lord added
to their number those who were being saved.
3
1 Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth
hour. 2 Now a man lame from birth was being carried every day to the Beautiful gate
of temple, so he could ask people who were going into the temple for a gift of money.
3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked them for a gift
of money. 4 Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, “Look at us.” 5 The
lame man looked at them, expecting to receive something from them. 6 But Peter
said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have, I will give to you. In the
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” 7 Taking him by the right hand, Peter raised
him up, and immediately the man's feet and ankle were made strong. 8 Leaping up,
the lame man stood and began to walk; and he entered with Peter and John into the
temple, walking, leaping, and praising God. 9 All the people saw him walking and
praising God. 10 They noticed that it was the man who had been asking people for a
gift of money at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder
and amazement because of what had happened to him.
11 As he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in
the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly marveling. 12 When Peter saw this, he
answered the people, “You men of Israel, why do you marvel? Why do you fix yourActs 3:13
1140
Acts 4:16
eyes on us, as if we had made him to walk by our own power or godliness? 13 The God
of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant
Jesus. He is the one whom you delivered up and rejected before the face of Pilate,
when he had decided to release him. 14 You rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and
you asked instead for a murderer to be released to you. 15 You killed the Founder of
life, whom God raised from the dead—and we are witnesses of this. 16 Now, by faith
in his name—this man whom you see and know—this same name made him strong.
The faith that is through Jesus gave to him this complete health in the presence of all
of you. 17 Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
18 But the things which God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ
should suffer, he has now fulfilled. 19 Repent, therefore, and turn, so that your sins
may be blotted out, so that there may come periods of refreshing from the presence
of the Lord; 20 and that he may send the Christ who has been appointed for you,
Jesus. 21 He is the One heaven must receive until the time of the restoration of all
things, about which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets. 22 Moses
indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet like me from among your brothers.
You shall listen to everything that he will speak to you. 23 It will happen that every
person who does not listen to that prophet will be completely destroyed from among
the people.' 24 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after him,
they spoke out and announced these days. 25 You are the sons of the prophets and
of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, as he said to Abraham, 'In your
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' 26 After God raised up his servant,
he sent him to you first, in order to bless you by turning every one of you from your
wickedness.”
4
1 As Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the
temple and the Sadducees came upon them. 2 They were deeply troubled because
Peter and John were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection
from the dead. 3 They arrested them and put them in jail until the next morning, since
it was now evening. 4 But many of the people who had heard the message believed;
and the number of the men who believed was about five thousand.
5 It came about on the next day that their rulers, elders and scribes gathered
together in Jerusalem. 6 Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John,
and Alexander, and all who were relatives of the high priest. 7 When they had set
Peter and John in their midst, they asked them, “By what power, or in what name,
have you done this?” 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “You
rulers of the people, and elders, 9 if we this day are being questioned concerning a
good deed done to a sick man, by what means was this man made well? 10 May this
be known to you all and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead, that this man
stands here before you healthy. 11 Jesus Christ is the stone which you as builders
despised but which has been made the head cornerstone. 12 There is no salvation
in any other person, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by
which we must be saved.”
13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were
ordinary, uneducated men, they were surprised, becoming aware that Peter and John
had been with Jesus. 14 Because they saw the man who was healed standing with
them, they had nothing to say against this. 15 But after they had commanded the
apostles to leave the council meeting, they talked among themselves. 16 They said,Acts 4:17
1141
Acts 5:5
“What shall we do to these men? For the fact that a remarkable miracle has been
done through them is known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem; we cannot deny
it. 17 But in order that it spreads no further among the people, let us warn them
not to speak anymore to anyone in this name.” 18 They called Peter and John in and
commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter
and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to obey
you rather than him, you judge. 20 We are not able to stop speaking about the things
we have seen and heard.” 21 After further warning Peter and John, they let them go.
They were unable to find any excuse to punish them, because all of the people were
praising God for what had been done. 22 The man who had experienced this miracle
of healing was more than forty years old.
23 After they were set free, Peter and John came to their own people and reported
all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 24 When they heard it, they
raised their voices together to God and said, “Lord, you made the heavens and the
earth and the sea, and all that is in them. 25 You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the
mouth of your servant, our father David,
'Why did the Gentile nations rage,
and the peoples imagine useless things?'
26 You said,
'The kings of the earth set themselves together,
and the rulers gathered together
against the Lord, and against his Christ.'
27 Indeed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the people
of Israel, gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you
anointed. 28 They gathered together to do all that your hand and your plan had
decided in advance would happen. 29 Now, Lord, look upon their warnings and grant
to your servants to speak your word with all boldness. 30 Stretch out your hand to
heal, and to give signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
31 When they finished praying, the place where they were gathered together was
shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they spoke the word of God
with boldness.
32 The great number of those who believed were of one heart and soul. No one said
that anything he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common. 33 With
great power the apostles were proclaiming their testimony about the resurrection of
the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 34 There was no person among
them who lacked anything, for all who owned title to lands or houses sold them and
brought the money of the things that were sold 35 and laid it at the apostles' feet, and
it was distributed to each one according to their need.
36 Joseph, a Levite, a man from Cyprus whom the apostles called Barnabas (which
means Son of Encouragement), 37 sold a field and brought the money and laid it at
the apostles' feet.
5
1 Now a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of
property, 2 and he kept back part of the sale money (his wife also knew it), and
brought the other part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet. 3 But Peter said, “Ananias,
why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the
price of the land? 4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own, and after
it was sold, was it not in your control? How is it that you thought of this thing in your
heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.” 5 Hearing these words, Ananias fellActs 5:6
1142
Acts 5:37
down and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard it. 6 The young
men came forward and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.
7 After about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 8 Peter
said to her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.” She said, “Yes, for so
much.” 9 Then Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together to test the
Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door,
and they will carry you out.” 10 She immediately fell down at his feet and breathed
her last. When the young men came in, they found her dead, and carried her out
and buried her beside her husband. 11 Great fear came upon the whole church, and
upon all who heard these things.
12 Many signs and wonders were taking place among the people through the hands
of the apostles. They were all together in Solomon's Porch. 13 But no one else had the
courage to join them; however, they were held in high esteem by the people. 14 Still
more believers were being added to the Lord, multitudes of men and women, 15 so
that they even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches,
so that as Peter came by, his shadow might fall on some of them. 16 There also came
together a great number of people from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the
sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
17 But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of
the Sadducees); and they were filled with jealousy 18 and laid hands on the apostles,
and put them in the public jail. 19 Yet during the night an angel of the Lord opened
the doors of the jail and led them out, and said, 20 “Go, stand in the temple and speak
to the people all the words of this life.” 21 When they heard this, they entered into
the temple about daybreak and taught. But the high priest came, and those who
were with him, and called the council together, all the elders of the people of Israel,
and sent to the jail to have the apostles brought. 22 But the officers that went did
not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported, 23 “We found the jail
securely shut and the guards standing at the door, but when we had opened it, we
found no one inside.” 24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests
heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them as to what would
come of it. 25 Then someone came and told them, “The men whom you put in the jail
are standing in the temple and teaching the people.” 26 So the captain went with the
officers, and brought them back, but without violence, for they feared that the people
might stone them. 27 When they had brought them, they set them before the council.
The high priest interrogated them, 28 saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in
this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and desire to bring
this man's blood upon us.” 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey
God rather than men. 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed
by hanging him on a tree. 31 God exalted him to his right hand to be a prince and
a savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 32 We are witnesses of
these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”
33 When the council members heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill the
apostles. 34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored
by all the people, stood up and commanded the apostles to be taken outside for a
little while. 35 Then he said to them, “Men of Israel, pay close attention to what you
propose to do with these people. 36 For some time ago, Theudas rose up claiming to be
somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and
all who had been obeying him were scattered and came to nothing. 37 After this man,
Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people afterActs 5:38
1143
Acts 7:7
him. He also perished, and all who had been obeying him were scattered. 38 Now I
say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or work is
of men, it will be overthrown. 39 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow
them; you may even find that you are fighting against God.” So they were persuaded.
40 Then they called the apostles in and beat them and commanded them not to speak
in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 41 They left the council rejoicing that they
were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name. 42 Thereafter every day, in the
temple and from house to house, they were continuously teaching and proclaiming
Jesus as the Christ.
6
1 Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint
by the Grecian Jews began against the Hebrews, because their widows were being
overlooked in the daily distribution of food. 2 The twelve called the multitude of the
disciples to them and said, “It is not right for us to give up the word of God in order
to serve tables. 3 You should therefore choose, brothers, seven men from among
yourselves, men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may
appoint over this business. 4 As for us, we will always continue in prayer and in the
ministry of the word.” 5 Their speech pleased the whole multitude. So they chose
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor,
Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch. 6 The believers brought
these men before the apostles, who prayed and then placed their hands upon them.
7 So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem
increased greatly, and a large number of the priests became obedient to the faith.
8 Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among
the people. 9 But there arose some people who belonged to the synagogue called
the synagogue of the Freedmen, of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from
Cilicia and Asia. These people were debating with Stephen. 10 But they were not able
to stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke. 11 Then they
bribed some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against
Moses and against God.” 12 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes,
and they approached Stephen and seized him and brought him before the council.
13 They brought false witnesses, who said, “This man does not stop speaking words
against this holy place and the law. 14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of
Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to
us.” 15 Everyone who sat in the council fixed their eyes on him and saw his face was
like the face of an angel.
7
1 The high priest said, “Are these things true?” 2 Stephen said,
“Brothers and fathers, listen to me: The God of glory appeared to our father
Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran; 3 he said to him,
'Leave your land and your relatives, and go into the land that I will show you.' 4 Then
he left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran; from there, after his father
died, God brought him into this land, where you live now. 5 He gave none of it as
an inheritance to him, no, not even enough to set a foot on. But he promised—even
though Abraham had no child yet—that he would give the land as a possession to
him and to his descendants after him. 6 God was speaking to him like this, that his
descendants would live for a while in a foreign land, and that the inhabitants there
would bring them into slavery and treat them badly for four hundred years. 7 'But IActs 7:8
1144
Acts 7:39
will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they will come out and
worship me in this place.' 8 Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision,
so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac
became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs. 9 Because
the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him into Egypt; but God was with
him 10 and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph favor and wisdom
in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who had made him governor over Egypt
and over all his household. 11 Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan,
and great suffering, and our fathers could find no food. 12 But when Jacob heard
that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first trip. 13 On their
second trip Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became
known to Pharaoh. 14 Joseph sent his brothers back to tell Jacob his father to come to
Egypt, along with all his relatives, seventy-five persons in all. 15 So Jacob went down
into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers. 16 They were carried over to Shechem
and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a price in silver from the sons
of Hamor in Shechem. 17 As the time of the promise approached, the promise that
God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 18 until there
arose another king over Egypt, a king who did not know about Joseph. 19 He deceived
our people and forced our fathers to expose their newborn infants so they would not
be kept alive. 20 At that time Moses was born; he was very beautiful before God
and was nourished for three months in his father's house. 21 When he was placed
outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son. 22 Moses
was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words
and works. 23 But when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit
his brothers, the children of Israel. 24 Seeing an Israelite being mistreated, Moses
defended him and avenged him who was oppressed by striking the Egyptian: 25 he
thought that his brothers would understand that God by his hand was rescuing them,
but they did not understand. 26 On the next day he came to some Israelites as they
were quarreling; he tried to put them at peace with each other; he said, 'Men, you
are brothers; why are you hurting one another?' 27 But the one who had wronged his
neighbor pushed him away, and said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
28 Would you like to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' 29 Moses ran away
after hearing this; he became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the
father of two sons. 30 When forty years were past, an angel appeared to him in the
wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. 31 When Moses saw the fire,
he marveled at the sight; and as he approached to look at it, there came a voice of
the Lord, saying, 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac,
and of Jacob.' Moses trembled and did not dare to look. 33 The Lord said to him, 'Take
off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
34 I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard
their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them; now come, I will send you to
Egypt.' 35 This Moses whom they rejected, when they said, 'Who made you a ruler
and a judge?'—he was the one whom God sent as both a ruler and deliverer. God sent
him by the hand of the angel who appeared to Moses in the bush. 36 Moses led them
out of Egypt, after doing miracles and signs in Egypt and at the Sea of Reeds, and in
the wilderness during forty years. 37 It is the same Moses who said to the people of
Israel, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, a prophet like
me.' 38 This is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel
who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. This is the man who was with our fathers;
this is the man who received living words to give to us. 39 This is the man whom ourActs 7:40
1145
Acts 8:3
fathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts
they turned back to Egypt. 40 At that time they said to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will
lead us. As for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what
has happened to him.' 41 So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to
the idol, and rejoiced because of the work of their hands. 42 But God turned and gave
them up to worship the stars in the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets,
'Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices
for forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?
43 You accepted the tabernacle of Molech
and the star of the god Rephan,
and the images that you made to worship them:
and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'
44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God
commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he should make it like the pattern that he
had seen. 45 Later, our fathers, under Joshua, received the tabernacle and brought it
with them when they took possession of the land. God took the land from the nations
and drove them out before the face of our fathers. The tabernacle remained in the
land until the time of David, 46 who found favor in the sight of God, and he asked if he
might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. 47 But it was Solomon who built the
house for God. 48 However, the Most High does not live in houses made with hands,
as the prophet says,
49 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool for my feet.
What kind of house can you build for me? says the Lord,
or what is the place for my rest?
50 Did my hand not make all these things?'
51 You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always
resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your fathers acted. 52 Which of the prophets did
your fathers not persecute? They killed the prophets who appeared in advance of the
coming of the Righteous One; and you have now become the betrayers and murderers
of him also, 53 you people who received the law that angels had established, but you
did not keep it.”
54 Now when the council members heard these things, they were cut to the heart,
and they ground their teeth at Stephen. 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked
up intently into heaven and saw the glory of God; and he saw Jesus standing at the
right hand of God. 56 Stephen said, “Look, I see the heavens opened, and the Son
of Man standing at the right hand of God.” 57 At this the council members covered
their ears, and shouting out with a loud voice, altogether they rushed at him. 58 They
dragged him out of the city where they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid
down their outer clothing at the feet of a young man named Saul. 59 As they were
stoning Stephen, he was calling out to the Lord and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit.” 60 He knelt down and called out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin
against them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.
8
1 Saul was in agreement with his death.
So there began on that day a great persecution against the church that was in
Jerusalem; and the believers were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea
and Samaria, except the apostles. 2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great
lamentation over him. 3 But Saul greatly harmed the church; he went into house
after house and dragged out men and women, and put them into prison.Acts 8:4
1146
Acts 8:36
4 Yet the believers who had been scattered went about proclaiming the word.
5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. 6 When
multitudes of people heard and saw the signs that Philip did, they paid attention
together to what he said. 7 Unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed,
crying out with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
8 So there was much joy in that city.
9 But there was a certain man in the city named Simon, who had earlier been
practicing sorcery; he used to astonish the people of Samaria, while claiming that he
was an important person. 10 All the Samaritans, from the least to the greatest, paid
attention to him; they said, “This man is that power of God which is called Great.”
11 They listened to him, because he had astonished them for a long time with his
sorceries. 12 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news about
the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and
women. 13 Even Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized he stayed with
Philip constantly. When he saw signs and mighty deeds taking place, he was amazed.
14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word
of God, they sent to them Peter and John. 15 When they had come down, they prayed
for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 16 For until that time, the Holy Spirit
had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized into the name of the
Lord Jesus. 17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the
Holy Spirit. 18 Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying
on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money. 19 He said, “Give me this power, too,
that whoever I place my hands on might receive the Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter said to
him, “May your silver perish along with you, because you thought to obtain the gift
of God with money. 21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is
not right with God. 22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the
Lord, so that he might perhaps forgive you for the intention of your heart. 23 For I see
that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bonds of sin.” 24 Simon answered
and said, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”
25 When they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned
to Jerusalem, proclaiming the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, “Arise and go toward the south
to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This road is in a desert.) 27 He
arose and went. Behold, there was a man from Cush, a eunuch of great authority
under Candace, queen of the Cushites. He was in charge of all her treasure. He had
come to Jerusalem to worship. 28 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was
reading the prophet Isaiah. 29 The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and stay close to this
chariot.” 30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said,
“Do you understand what you are reading?” 31 The Cushite said, “How can I, unless
someone guides me?” He begged Philip to come up into the chariot and sit with him.
32 Now the passage of the scripture which the Ethiopian was reading was this,
“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
and like a lamb before his shearer is silent,
so he did not open his mouth.
33 In his humiliation justice was taken away from him.
Who can fully describe his descendants?
For his life was taken from the earth.”
34 So the eunuch asked Philip, and said, “I beg you, who is the prophet speaking about,
himself, or someone else?” 35 Philip began to speak, and beginning with this scripture
he proclaimed the good news about Jesus to him. 36 As they went on the road, theyActs 8:37
1147
Acts 9:25
came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, there is water here. What prevents
me from being baptized?” 37 * 38 So the Ethiopian commanded the chariot to stop.
They went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and Philip baptized him.
39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away, and
the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip appeared
at Azotus and he went through that region, proclaiming the gospel to all the cities
until he came to Caesarea.
9
1 But Saul, still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples of the Lord,
went to the high priest 2 and asked him for letters for the synagogues in Damascus,
so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might
bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3 As he was traveling, it happened that as he came
near to Damascus, suddenly there shone all around him a light out of heaven; 4 and
he fell upon the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you
persecuting me?” 5 Saul replied, “Who are you, Lord?” The Lord said, “I am Jesus
whom you are persecuting; 6 but rise, enter into the city, and it will be told you what
you must do.” 7 The men who traveled with Saul stood speechless, hearing the voice,
but seeing no one. 8 Saul arose from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he
could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 For
three days he was without sight, and he neither ate nor drank.
10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him
in a vision, “Ananias!” He said, “See, I am here, Lord.” 11 The Lord said to him,
“Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and at the house of Judas ask for
a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. 12 He has seen in a vision a man
named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him, so that he might see again.”
13 But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much
harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 14 He has authority from the
chief priests to arrest everyone here who calls upon your name.” 15 But the Lord
said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine, to carry my name before the
Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel; 16 for I will show him how much he
must suffer for the cause of my name.” 17 So Ananias departed, and entered into the
house. Laying his hands on him, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared
to you on the road when you were coming, has sent me so that you might receive
your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 18 Immediately something like scales
fell from Saul's eyes, and he received his sight; he arose and was baptized; 19 and he
ate and was strengthened.
He stayed with the disciples in Damascus for several days. 20 Right away he
proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying that he is the Son of God. 21 All who heard
him were amazed and said, “Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem
who called on this name? He has come here to take them bound to the chief priests.”
22 But Saul became more and more powerful, and he was causing distress among the
Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.
23 After many days, the Jews planned together to kill him. 24 But their plan became
known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night in order to kill him. 25 But his
disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a
basket.
* 8:37
The best ancient copies omit Acts 8:37, Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may be
baptized.” The Ethiopian answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God” .Acts 9:26
1148
Acts 10:12
26 When he had come to Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they
were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him
and brought him to the apostles, and he told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the
road and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how at Damascus Saul had spoken
boldly in the name of Jesus. 28 He met with them as they were coming in and going
out of Jerusalem. He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus 29 and debated with
the Grecian Jews; but they kept trying to kill him. 30 When the brothers learned of
this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
31 So then, the church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and was
built up; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit,
the church grew in numbers. 32 Now it came about that, as Peter went throughout
the whole region, he came down also to the believers who lived in the town of Lydda.
33 There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been in his bed for eight
years, for he was paralyzed. 34 Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get
up and make your bed,” and right away he got up. 35 So everyone who lived in Lydda
and in Sharon saw the man and they turned to the Lord.
36 Now there was in Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated as
“Dorcas.” This woman was full of good works and merciful deeds that she did for the
poor. 37 It came about in those days that she fell sick and died; when they had washed
her, they laid her in an upper room. 38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples
had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, begging him, “Come to
us without delay.” 39 Peter arose and went with them. When he had arrived, they
brought him to the upper room, and all the widows stood by him weeping, showing
him the coats and garments that Dorcas had made while she had been with them.
40 Peter put them all out of the room, knelt down, and prayed; then, turning to the
body, he said, “Tabitha, arise.” Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
41 Peter then gave her his hand and lifted her up; and when he called the believers and
the widows, he presented her alive to them. 42 This matter became known throughout
all Joppa, and many people believed on the Lord. 43 It happened that Peter stayed for
many days in Joppa with a man named Simon, a tanner.
10
1 Now there was a certain man in the city of Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a
centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment. 2 He was a devout man, one who
worshiped God with all his household; he gave much money to those in need, and
he constantly prayed to God. 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a
vision an angel of God coming to him. The angel said to him, “Cornelius!” 4 Cornelius
stared at the angel and was very frightened and said, “What is it, sir?” The angel said
to him, “Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have gone up as a memorial offering
into God's presence. 5 Now send men to the city of Joppa to bring a man named Simon
who is called Peter. 6 He is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by
the seaside.” 7 When the angel who spoke to him had left, Cornelius called two of his
house servants, and a devout soldier from among those who served him. 8 Cornelius
told them all that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
9 Now on the next day at about the sixth hour, as they were on their journey and
were approaching the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray. 10 He then
became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while the people were cooking
some food, he was given a vision, 11 and he saw the sky open and a certain container
descending, something like a large sheet coming down to the earth, let down by its
four corners. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and things that crawledActs 10:13
1149
Acts 10:42
on the earth, and birds of the sky. 13 Then a voice spoke to him: “Rise, Peter, kill
and eat.” 14 But Peter said, “Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that was
defiled and unclean.” 15 But the voice came to him again a second time: “What God
has cleansed, do not call it defiled.” 16 This happened three times; then the container
was immediately taken back up into the sky.
17 Now while Peter was very confused about what the vision that he had seen could
mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius stood before the gate, after they
had asked their way to the house. 18 They called out and asked whether Simon, who
was also called Peter, was staying there. 19 While Peter was still thinking about the
vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. * 20 Arise and
go down and go with them. Do not hesitate to go with them, because I have sent
them.” 21 So Peter went down to the men and said, “I am he whom you are seeking.
Why have you come?” 22 They said, “A centurion named Cornelius, a righteous man
and one who worships God, and is well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was
told by a holy angel of God to send for you to come to his house, so he could listen to
a message from you.” 23 So Peter invited them to come in and stay with him.
On the next morning he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from
Joppa accompanied him. 24 On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius
was waiting for them; he had called together his relatives and his close friends. 25 It
came about that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet
to worship him. 26 But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up! I too am a man.”
27 While Peter was talking with him, he went in and found many people gathered
together. 28 He said to them, “You yourselves know that it is not lawful for a Jewish
man to associate with or to visit someone from another nation. But God has shown
me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean. 29 That is why I came without
arguing, when I was sent for. So I ask you why you sent for me.” 30 Cornelius said,
“Four days ago at this very hour, I was praying at the ninth hour in my house; and
see, a man stood before me in bright clothing. 31 He said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has
been heard by God, and your gifts to the poor have reminded God about you. 32 So
send someone to Joppa, and call to you a man named Simon who is called Peter. He
is staying in the house of a tanner named Simon, by the seaside.' † 33 So at once I sent
for you. You are kind to have come. Now then, we are all here present in the sight of
God, to hear everything that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.” ‡ 34 Then
Peter opened his mouth and said,
“Truly, I perceive that God does not take anyone's side. 35 Instead, in every nation
anyone who worships and does righteous deeds is acceptable to him. 36 You know the
message that he sent to the people of Israel, when he announced good news about
peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all— 37 you yourselves know the events
that took place, which occurred throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee, after
the baptism that John announced; 38 the events concerning Jesus of Nazareth, how
God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good
and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 39 We are
witnesses of all the things Jesus did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.
They killed him by hanging him on a tree, 40 but God raised him up on the third day
and caused him to be seen, 41 not by all the people, but to the witnesses who were
chosen beforehand by God—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from
the dead. 42 He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that this is the

† 10:32
‡ 10:33 Instead of instructed by the Lord toActs 10:43

Acts 11:26
one who has been chosen by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead. 43 It is
to him that all the prophets bear witness, so that everyone who believes in him shall
receive forgiveness of sins through his name.”
44 While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all of those who
were listening to his message. 45 The people who belonged to the circumcision group
of believers—all of those who came with Peter—were amazed, because the gift of
the Holy Spirit was poured out also on the Gentiles. 46 For they heard these Gentiles
speak in other languages and praising God. Then Peter answered, 47 “Can anyone
keep water from these people so they should not be baptized, these people who have
received the Holy Spirit as well as we?” 48 Then he commanded them to be baptized
in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay with them for several days.
11
1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also
had received the word of God. 2 When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, they who
belonged to the circumcision group criticized him; 3 they said, “You associated with
uncircumcised men and ate with them!” 4 But Peter started to explain the matter to
them in detail; he said, 5 I was praying in the city of Joppa, and I had a vision of a
container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners.
It descended to me. 6 I gazed at it and I thought about it. I saw the four-legged animals
of earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the sky. 7 Then I heard a voice
say to me, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat!” 8 I said, “Not so, Lord; for nothing unholy
or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.” 9 But the voice answered again from
heaven, “What God has declared clean, do not call unclean.” 10 This happened three
times, and then everything was taken back up into heaven again. 11 Behold, right
away there were three men standing in front of the house where we were; they had
been sent from Caesarea to me. 12 The Spirit commanded me to go with them, and
that I should make no distinction regarding them. These six brothers went with me,
and we went into the man's house. 13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing
in his house and saying, “Send men to Joppa and bring back Simon who is called
Peter. 14 He will speak to you a message by which you will be saved—you and all
your household.” 15 As I began to speak to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, just
as on us in the beginning. 16 I remembered the words of the Lord, how he said, “John
indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.” 17 Then
if God gave to them the same gift as he gave to us when we believed on the Lord
Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could oppose God?” 18 When they heard these things,
they said nothing in response, but they praised God and said, “Then God has given
repentance for life to the Gentiles also.”
19 Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose over Stephen
spread as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word only to Jews.
20 But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, came to Antioch and spoke also
to Greeks, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. 21 The hand of the Lord
was with them; a great number believed and turned to the Lord. 22 News about them
came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas as far as
Antioch. 23 When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad; and he encouraged
them all to remain with the Lord with all their heart. 24 For he was a good man
and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.
25 Barnabas then went out to Tarsus to look for Saul. 26 When he found him, he
brought him to Antioch. It came about, that for an entire year they gathered togetherActs 11:27
1151
Acts 12:23
with the church and taught many people. The disciples were called Christians first
in Antioch.
27 Now in these days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One
of them, Agabus by name, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine
would occur over all the world. This happened in the days of Claudius. 29 So, the
disciples, as each one was able, decided to send help to the brothers in Judea. 30 They
did this; they sent money to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
12
1 Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the
church so that he might mistreat them. 2 He killed James the brother of John with
the sword. 3 After he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter
also. That was during the days of unleavened bread. 4 After arresting him, he put
him in prison, assigning him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him; he was
intending to bring him to the people after the Passover. 5 So Peter was kept in the
prison, but prayer was made earnestly to God for him by those in the church. 6 On the
night before Herod was going to bring him out for trial, Peter was sleeping between
two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards in front of the door were keeping
watch over the prison. 7 Behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared by him, and
a light shone in the prison cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him and said,
“Get up quickly,” and his chains fell off his hands. 8 The angel said to him, “Dress
yourself and put on your sandals.” Peter did so. The angel said to him, “Put on your
outer garment and follow me.” 9 So Peter followed the angel and went out. He did
not know that what was done by the angel was real. He thought he was seeing a
vision. 10 After they had passed by the first guard and the second, they came to the
iron gate that led into the city; it opened for them by itself. They went out and went
down a street, and the angel left him right away. 11 When Peter came to himself, he
said, “Now I truly know that the Lord has sent his angel and delivered me out of
the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting.” 12 When
he realized this, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark,
where many people had gathered and were praying. 13 When he knocked at the door
of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. 14 When she recognized
Peter's voice, out of joy she failed to open the door; instead, she came running into
the room; she reported that Peter was standing at the door. 15 So they said to her,
“You are insane.” But she insisted that it was so. They said, “It is his angel.” 16 But
Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened the door, they saw him and
were amazed. 17 Peter motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and he told them
how the Lord had brought him out of prison. He said, “Report these things to James
and the brothers.” Then he left and went to another place. 18 Now when it became
day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had happened to
Peter. 19 After Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he questioned
the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to
Caesarea and stayed there.
20 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They went to him
together. They persuaded Blastus, the king's assistant, to help them. Then they asked
for peace, because their country received its food from the king's country. 21 On a set
day Herod dressed himself in royal clothing and sat on a throne; he made a speech to
them. 22 The people shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man!” 23 Immediately
an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; he was eaten
by worms and died.Acts 12:24
1152
Acts 13:25
24 But the word of God increased and multiplied.
25 So when Barnabas and Saul had completed their mission, they returned from *
Jerusalem, bringing with them John, also called Mark.
13
1 Now in the church in Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers. They were
Barnabas, Simeon (who is called Niger), Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the foster brother
of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul. 2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting,
the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to do the work to which
I have called them.” 3 After they had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on these
men, they sent them off.
4 So Barnabas and Saul obeyed the Holy Spirit and went down to Seleucia; from
there they sailed to the island of Cyprus. 5 When they were in the city of Salamis,
they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John
Mark as their assistant. 6 When they had gone through the whole island to Paphos,
they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar Jesus.
7 This magician associated with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent
man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, because he wanted to hear the word
of God. 8 But Elymas “the magician” (that is how his name is translated) opposed
them; he tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 9 But Saul, who is also
called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, stared at him intensely. 10 and said, “You son
of the devil, you are full of all kinds of deceit and wickedness. You are an enemy
of every kind of righteousness. You will never stop twisting the straight paths of the
Lord, will you? 11 Now look, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will become
blind. You will not see the sun for a while.” Immediately there fell on Elymas a mist
and darkness; he started going around asking people to lead him by the hand. 12 After
the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was astonished at the
teaching about the Lord.
13 Now Paul and his friends set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia.
But John left them and returned to Jerusalem. 14 Paul and his friends traveled from
Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day and sat down. 15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the
leaders of the synagogue sent them a message saying, “Brothers, if you have any
message of encouragement for the people here, say it.” 16 So Paul stood up and
motioned with his hand; he said, “Men of Israel and you who honor God, listen.
17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people numerous
when they stayed in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out
of it. 18 For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. * 19 After he
had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave our people their land
for an inheritance. 20 All these events took place over four hundred and fifty years.
After all these things, God gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 21 Then the
people asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe
of Benjamin, to be king for forty years. 22 After God removed him from the kingship,
he raised up David to be their king. It was about David that God said, 'I have found
David son of Jesse to be a man after my heart, who does all I want him to do.' 23 From
this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus, as he promised to do.
24 This began to happen when, before Jesus came, John first announced the baptism
of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25 As John was finishing his work, he said,
* 12:25 Some ancient copies read, they returned to Jerusalem .
forty years he cared for them in the wilderness .
* 13:18 Some ancient copies read, For aboutActs 13:26
1153
Acts 13:52
'Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But listen, one is coming after me, the
shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.' 26 Brothers, children of the line of
Abraham, and those among you who worship God, it is to us that the message about
this salvation has been sent. 27 For they who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers,
did not recognize him, and they fulfilled sayings of the prophets that are read every
Sabbath by condemning him. 28 Even though they found no good cause for death in
him, they asked Pilate to kill him. 29 When they had completed all the things that
were written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
30 But God raised him from the dead. 31 He was seen for many days by those who had
come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These people are now his witnesses to
the people. 32 So we are telling you the good news that what God promised to our
fathers 33 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in
the second Psalm:
'You are my Son, today I have become your Father.'
34 The fact that he raised him up from the dead so that his body would never decay,
God has spoken in this way:
'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'
35 This is why he also says in another Psalm,
'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'
36 For when David had served the desires of God in his own generation, he fell asleep;
he was laid with his fathers and his body experienced decay. 37 But he whom God
raised up experienced no decay. 38 So let it be known to you, brothers, that through
this man is proclaimed to you forgiveness of sins. 39 By him every one who believes
is justified from all the things which the law of Moses could not justify you. 40 So then
be careful that the thing the prophets spoke about does not happen to you:
41 'Look, you despisers, and be astonished and then perish;
For I am doing a work in your days,
A work that you shall never believe, even if someone announces it to you.'”
42 As Paul and Barnabas left, the people begged them that they might speak these
same words again the next Sabbath. 43 When the synagogue meeting ended, many of
the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and
urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44 On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the
word of the Lord. 45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy
and spoke against the things that were said by Paul and insulted him. 46 But Paul
and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, “It was necessary that the word of God
should first be spoken to you. Seeing you push it away from yourselves and consider
yourselves unworthy of eternal life, see, we will turn to the Gentiles. 47 For so has
the Lord commanded us, saying,
'I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles,
that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'”
48 As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord. As
many as were appointed to eternal life believed. 49 The word of the Lord was spread
out through the whole region. 50 But the Jews urged on the devout and important
women, as well as the leading men of the city. These stirred up a persecution against
Paul and Barnabas and threw them out beyond the border of their city. 51 But Paul
and Barnabas shook off the dust from their feet against them. Then they went to the
city of Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.Acts 14:1
1 It
1154
Acts 15:2
14
came about in Iconium that Paul and Barnabas entered together into the
synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude both of Jews
and of Greeks believed. 2 But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up the minds
of the Gentiles and made them bitter against the brothers. 3 So they stayed there for
a long time, speaking boldly with the Lord's power, while he gave evidence about
the message of his grace. He did this by granting signs and wonders to be done by
the hands of Paul and Barnabas. 4 But the majority of the city was divided: some
people sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 5 When both Gentiles and
Jews attempted to persuade their leaders to mistreat and stone Paul and Barnabas,
6 they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and
the surrounding region, 7 and there they were proclaiming the gospel.
8 At Lystra a certain man sat, powerless in his feet, a cripple from his mother's
womb, who never had walked. 9 This man heard Paul speaking. Paul fixed his eyes
on him and saw that he had faith to be made well. 10 So he said to him in a loud voice,
“Stand up on your feet.” Then the man jumped up and walked around. 11 When
the multitude saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the dialect
of Lycaonia, “The gods have come down to us in the form of men.” 12 They called
Barnabas “Zeus,” and Paul, “Hermes,” because he was the main speaker. 13 The priest
of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates;
he and the multitudes wanted to offer sacrifice. 14 But when the apostles, Barnabas
and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothing and quickly went out into the crowd,
crying out 15 and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human
beings with the same feelings as you. We bring you good news, that you should turn
from these useless things to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, and the
sea and everything that is in them. 16 In the past ages, he allowed all the nations to
walk in their own ways. 17 But still, he did not leave himself without witness, in that
he did good and gave you the rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your
hearts with food and gladness.” 18 Even with these words, Paul and Barnabas barely
kept the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
19 But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came and persuaded the crowds. They
stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead. 20 Yet as the
disciples were standing around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day, he
went to Derbe with Barnabas. 21 After they had proclaimed the gospel in that city and
made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch. 22 They
kept strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in
the faith, saying, “We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings.”
23 When they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with
fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed. 24 Then they
passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 25 When they had spoken the word
in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 26 From there they sailed to Antioch, where they
had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.
27 When they arrived in Antioch and gathered the church together, they reported all
the things that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith for
the Gentiles. 28 They stayed for a long time with the disciples.
15
1 Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and taught the brothers, saying,
“Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”
2 This brought Paul and Barnabas into a sharp dispute and debate with them. So PaulActs 15:3
1155
Acts 15:29
and Barnabas along with some others from among them were appointed to go up to
Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and elders about this question. 3 They therefore,
being sent by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria and announced
the conversion of the Gentiles. They brought great joy to all the brothers. 4 When
they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the
elders, and they reported all the things that God had done with them. 5 But certain
men who believed, who belonged to the group of Pharisees, stood up and said, “It is
necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses.” 6 So
the apostles and the elders gathered together to consider this matter. 7 After much
debate, Peter stood up and said to them,
“Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that
by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 8 God,
who knows the heart, witnesses to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did
to us; 9 and he made no distinction between us and them, making their hearts clean
by faith. 10 Now therefore why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the
neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 But we
believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were.”
12 All the multitude kept silent while they listened to Barnabas and Paul report the
signs and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles through them. 13 After they
stopped speaking, James answered, saying,
“Brothers, listen to me. 14 Simon has told how God first graciously helped the
Gentiles in order to take from them a people for his name. 15 The words of the
prophets agree with this, as it is written,
16 'After these things I will return,
and I will build again the tent of David, which has fallen down;
I will set up and restore its ruins again,
17 so that the remnant of men may seek the Lord,
including all the Gentiles called by my name.'
18 This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from
ancient times. *
19 Therefore, my opinion is, that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn
to God. 20 But we will write to them that they must keep away from the pollution
of idols, from sexual immorality, and from the meat of strangled animals, and from
blood. 21 For Moses has been proclaimed in every city from the ancient times and he
is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”
22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to
choose Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders of the church, and send
them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. 23 They wrote this: “From the apostles and
elders, your brothers, to the Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings!
24 We have heard that certain men have gone out from us, with no orders from us,
and have disturbed you with teachings that upset your souls. 25 This being so, all
of us have agreed to choose men and to send them to you along with our beloved
Barnabas and Paul, 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ. 27 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same thing
themselves in their own words. 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us,
to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: 29 that you abstain
from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality.
If you keep yourselves from these, it shall be well with you. Farewell.”
* 15:18 Some older versions read, This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient
times .Acts 15:30
1156
Acts 16:17
30 So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; after they gathered the
multitude together, they delivered the letter. 31 When they had read it, they rejoiced
because of the encouragement. 32 Judas and Silas, also prophets, encouraged the
brothers with many words and strengthened them. 33 After they had spent some
time there, they were sent away in peace from the brothers to those who had sent
them. 34 † 35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch along with many others, where
they taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord.
36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return now and visit the brothers
in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”
37 Barnabas wanted to also take with them John who was called Mark. 38 But Paul
thought it was not good to take Mark, who had left them in Pamphylia and did not
go further with them in the work. 39 Then there arose a sharp disagreement, so that
they separated from each other, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away
to Cyprus. 40 But Paul chose Silas and left, after he was entrusted by the brothers to
the grace of the Lord. 41 Then he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the
churches.
16
1 Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra;
and behold, a certain disciple named
Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who believed; his father was a Greek.
2 He was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium. 3 Paul
wanted him to travel with him; so he took him and circumcised him because of the
Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 4 As they
went on their way through the cities, they delivered to the churches the instructions
for them to obey, the instructions that had been written by the apostles and elders in
Jerusalem. 5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number
daily.
6 Paul and his companions went through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, since
they had been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the word in the province of
Asia. 7 When they came near Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit
of Jesus prevented them. 8 So passing by Mysia, they came down to the city of Troas.
9 A vision appeared to Paul in the night: A man of Macedonia was standing there,
calling him and saying, “Come over into Macedonia and help us.” 10 When Paul had
seen the vision, immediately we set out to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had
called us to proclaim the gospel to them.
11 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and
the next day we came to Neapolis. 12 From there we went to Philippi, which is a city
of Macedonia, the most important city in the district and a Roman colony, and we
stayed in this city for several days. 13 On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate by
the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke
to the women who had come together. 14 A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of
purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, listened to us. The Lord opened
her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. 15 When she and her house were
baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord,
come and stay in house.” And she persuaded us. 16 It came about that, as we were
going to the place of prayer, a certain young woman who had a spirit of divination
encountered us. She brought her masters much gain by fortunetelling. 17 This woman
followed after Paul and us and shouted, saying, “These men are servants of the Most
† 15:34 The best ancient copies omit verse 34 (See: Acts 15:40), But it seemed good to Silas to remain there .Acts 16:18
1157
Acts 17:5
High God. They proclaim to you the way of salvation.” 18 She did this for many days.
But Paul, being greatly annoyed by her, turned and said to the spirit, “I command
you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out right away.
19 When her masters saw that their opportunity to make money was now gone, they
seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
20 When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are stirring
up our city. They are Jews. 21 They proclaim customs that are not lawful for Romans
to accept or practice.” 22 Then the crowd rose up together against Paul and Silas; the
magistrates tore their garments off them and commanded them to be beaten with
rods. 23 When they had laid many blows upon them, they threw them into prison
and commanded the jailer to keep them securely. 24 After he got this command,
the jailer threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
25 Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the
other prisoners were listening to them. 26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake,
so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors
were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened. 27 The jailer was awakened
from sleep and saw the open prison doors; he drew his sword and was about to kill
himself, because he thought that the prisoners had escaped. 28 But Paul shouted with
a loud voice, saying, “Do not harm yourself, because we are all here.” 29 The jailer
called for lights and rushed in and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,
30 and brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 31 They said,
“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house.” 32 They spoke
the word of the Lord to him, together with everyone in his house. 33 Then the jailer
took them at the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he and those
in his entire house were baptized immediately. 34 Then as he brought Paul and Silas
up into his house and he set food before them, he rejoiced greatly with those of his
house, that he had believed in God.
35 Now when it was day, the magistrates sent word to the guards, saying, “Let those
men go.” 36 The jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent
word to me to let you go. Now therefore come out, and go in peace.” 37 But Paul said
to them, “They have publicly beaten us without a trial, even through we are Romans
citizens—and they threw us into prison. Do they now want to send us away secretly?
No! Let them come themselves and lead us out.” 38 The guards reported these words
to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans, they were
afraid. 39 The magistrates came and apologized to them and brought them out, asking
them them to go away from the city. 40 So Paul and Silas went out of the prison and
came to the house of Lydia. When Paul and Silas saw the brothers, they encouraged
them and then departed from the city.
17
1 Now when they had passed through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
came to the city of Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 2 Paul, as
his custom was, went to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from
the scriptures. 3 He was opening the scriptures and explaining that it was necessary
for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead. He said, “This Jesus whom
I proclaim to you is the Christ.” 4 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul
and Silas, including a large number of devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading
women. 5 But the unbelieving Jews, being moved with jealousy, took certain wicked
men from the marketplace, gathered a crowd together, and set the city in an uproar.
Assaulting the house of Jason, they wanted to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.Acts 17:6
1158
Acts 17:34
6 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain other brothers
before the officials of the city, crying, “These men who have turned the world upside
down have come here also. 7 These men whom Jason has welcomed act against the
decrees of Caesar; they say that there is another king—Jesus.” 8 The crowd and the
officials of the city were disturbed when they heard these things. 9 But after the
officials made Jason and the rest pay money as security, then they let them go.
10 That night the brothers sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived there,
they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 Now these people were more noble
than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind,
examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. 12 Therefore
many of them believed, including some influential Greek women and many men.
13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word
of God at Berea, they went there and stirred up and troubled the crowds. 14 Then
immediately, the brothers sent Paul to go to the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed
there. 15 Those who were leading Paul took him as far as the city of Athens. As they
left Paul there, they received from him instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to
him as quickly as possible.
16 Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within
him as he saw the city full of idols. 17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the
Jews and others who worshiped God, as well as in the marketplace with those who
happened to be there. 18 But also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers
encountered him. Some said, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others said, “He
seems to be one who calls people to follow strange gods,” because he was proclaiming
Jesus and the resurrection. 19 They took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus,
saying, “May we know this new teaching which you were speaking? 20 For you bring
some strange things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know what these things
mean.” 21 (Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in
nothing but either telling or listening about something new.) 22 So Paul stood in the
middle of the Areopagus and said,
“You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way. 23 For as I passed
along and observed the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription,
“To an Unknown God.” What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to
you. 24 The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven
and earth, does not live in temples built with hands. 25 Neither is he served by men's
hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives people life and breath
and everything else. 26 From one man he made every nation of people to live on the
surface of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons and the boundaries
of their living areas, 27 so that they should search for God and perhaps they may feel
their way toward him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us. 28 For in
him we live and move and have our being, just as one of your own poets has said,
'For we also are his offspring.' 29 Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we
ought not to think that the qualities of deity are like gold, or silver, or stone—images
created by the art and imagination of man. 30 Therefore God overlooked the times of
ignorance, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent. 31 This is because
he has set a day when he will judge the world in righteousness by the man he has
chosen. God has given proof of this man to everyone by raising him from the dead.”
32 Now when the men of Athens heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked
Paul; but others said, “We will listen to you again about this matter.” 33 After that,
Paul left them. 34 But certain men joined him and believed, including Dionysius the
Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.Acts 18:1
1159
Acts 18:28
18
1 After these things Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 2 There he met a Jew
named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife
Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went
to them, 3 and because he worked at the same trade, he stayed with them and
worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. 4 So Paul reasoned in the synagogue
every Sabbath. He persuaded both Jews and Greeks. 5 But when Silas and Timothy
came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit to testify to the Jews
that Jesus was the Christ. 6 When the Jews opposed and insulted him, Paul shook out
his garment at them and said to them, “May your blood be upon your own heads; I
am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” 7 Then he left from there and
went to the house of Titius Justus, a man who worshiped God. His house was next to
the synagogue. 8 Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together
with all those who lived in his house; and many of the Corinthians who heard about
it believed and were baptized. 9 The Lord said to Paul in the night in a vision, “Do
not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent. 10 For I am with you, and no one will
try to harm you, for I have many people in this city.” 11 Paul lived there for a year
and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
12 But when Gallio became governor of Achaia, the Jews rose up together against
Paul and brought him before the judgment seat; 13 they said, “This man persuades
people to worship God contrary to the law.” 14 Yet when Paul was about to speak,
Gallio said to the Jews, “You Jews, if indeed it were a matter of wrong or a crime, it
would be reasonable to deal with you. 15 But since these are questions about words
and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I do not wish to be a judge of
these matters.” 16 Gallio made them leave the judgment seat. 17 So they all seized
Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat.
But Gallio did not care what they did.
18 Paul, after staying there for many more days, left the brothers and sailed for Syria
with Priscilla and Aquila. Before he left the seaport, Cenchrea, he had his hair cut off
because of a vow he had taken. 19 When they came to Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and
Aquila there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
20 When they asked Paul to stay a longer time, he declined. 21 But taking his leave
of them, he said, “I will return again to you if it is God's will.” He then set sail from
Ephesus.
22 When
Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the Jerusalem
church and then went down to Antioch. 23 After having spent some time there, Paul
departed and went through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia and strengthened all
the disciples.
24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, came to Ephesus. He
was eloquent in speech and mighty in the scriptures. 25 Apollos had been instructed
in the teachings of the Lord. Being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately
the things concerning Jesus, but he knew only the baptism of John. 26 Apollos began
to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took
him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. 27 When he desired
to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples
in Achaia to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who believed
by grace. 28 Apollos powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, showing by the
scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.Acts 19:1
1160
Acts 19:30
19
1 It came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper
country and came to the city of Ephesus, and found certain disciples there. 2 Paul
said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They said to him,
“No, we did not even hear about the Holy Spirit.” 3 Paul said, “Into what then were
you baptized?” They said, “Into John's baptism.” 4 So Paul replied, “John baptized
with the baptism of repentance. He told the people that they should believe in the
one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.” 5 When the people heard this,
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 Then when Paul had laid his
hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in other languages and
prophesied. 7 In all they were about twelve men.
8 Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and
persuading them about the kingdom of God. 9 But when some Jews were hardened
and disobedient, they began to speak evil of the Way before the crowd. So Paul left
them and took the disciples from him, reasoning with them every day in the lecture
hall of Tyrannus. 10 This continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard
the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. 11 God was doing mighty deeds by the
hands of Paul, 12 so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were
taken to the sick and their illnesses left them and the evil spirits came out of them.
13 But there were Jewish exorcists traveling through the area. They called on the
name of the Lord Jesus so they could have power over evil spirits when they said,
“By the Jesus whom Paul proclaims, I command you to come out.” 14 The Jewish high
priest, whose name was Sceva, had seven sons who were doing this. 15 An evil spirit
answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?” 16 The evil spirit
in the man leaped on the exorcists and overpowered them and beat them up. Then
they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 17 This became known to all, both
Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They became very afraid, and the name of
the Lord Jesus was honored. 18 Also, many of the believers came and confessed and
admitted the evil things they had done. 19 Many who practiced magical arts brought
their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they counted
the value of them, it was fifty thousand pieces of silver. 20 So the word of the Lord
spread very widely in powerful ways.
21 Now after Paul completed his ministry in Ephesus, he decided in the Spirit to pass
through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem; he said, “After I have been
there, I must also see Rome.” 22 Paul sent to Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy
and Erastus, who had helped him. But he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
23 At about that time there was no small disturbance in Ephesus concerning the
Way. 24 A certain silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver statues of Artemis,
brought in much business for the craftsmen. 25 So he gathered together the workmen
of that occupation and said, “Sirs, you know that in this business we make much
money. 26 You see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia,
this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people. He is saying that there are
no gods that are made with hands. 27 Not only is there danger that our trade will
no longer be needed, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be
considered worthless. Then she would even lose her greatness, she whom all Asia
and the world worships.” 28 When they heard this, they were filled with anger and
cried out, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.” 29 The whole city was filled
with confusion, and the people rushed together into the theater. They had seized
Paul's travel companions, Gaius and Aristarchus, who came from Macedonia. 30 Paul
wanted to enter in among the crowd of people, but the disciples prevented him.Acts 19:31
1161
Acts 20:16
31 Also, some of the officials of the province of Asia who were his friends sent him
a message strongly requesting him not to enter the theater. 32 Some people were
shouting one thing, and some another, for the crowd was in confusion. Most of them
did not even know why they had come together. 33 Some of the crowd informed
Alexander, whom the Jews were pushing to the front, and so Alexander motioned
with his hand, wanting to give an explanation to those who were assembled. 34 But
when they became aware that he was a Jew, they all cried out for about two hours
with one voice, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.” 35 When the town clerk
had quieted the crowd, he said, “You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does
not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis and
of the image which fell down from heaven? 36 Seeing then that these things are
undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. 37 For you have brought
these men to this court who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our
goddess. 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have an
accusation against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them
accuse one another. 39 But if you seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled
in the regular assembly. 40 For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning
this day's riot. There is no cause for this disorder, and we will not be able to explain
it.” 41 When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
20
1 After the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and after he encouraged
them, he said farewell and left to go into Macedonia. 2 When he had gone through
those regions and had spoken many words of encouragement to them, he came to
Greece. 3 After he had spent three months there, a plot was formed against him
by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, so he decided to return through
Macedonia. 4 Accompanying him as far as Asia were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from
Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus, both from the Thessalonian believers; Gaius of
Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia. 5 But these men had gone
before us and were waiting for us at Troas. 6 We sailed away from Philippi after the
days of unleavened bread, and in five days we came to them in Troas. There we
stayed for seven days.
7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul
spoke to the believers. He was planning to leave the next day, so he kept speaking
until midnight. 8 There were many lamps in the upper room where we had come
together. 9 In the window was sitting a young man named Eutychus, who fell into a
deep sleep. As Paul spoke even longer, this young man, still sleeping, fell down from
the third story and was picked up dead. 10 But Paul went down, stretched himself
out on him, and embraced him. Then he said, “Do not be upset any more, for he is
alive.” 11 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking with
them much longer until dawn, he left. 12 They brought back the boy alive and were
greatly comforted.
13 We ourselves went ahead of Paul by ship and sailed away to Assos, where we
planned to take Paul on board. This is what he himself desired to do, because he
planned to go by land. 14 When he met us at Assos, we took him onto the ship and
went to Mitylene. 15 Then we sailed from there and arrived the next day opposite the
island of Chios. The following day we touched at the island of Samos, and the day
after we came to the city of Miletus. 16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so
that he would not spend any time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem for
the day of Pentecost, if it were at all possible for him to do so.Acts 20:17
1162
Acts 21:8
17 From Miletus he sent men to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the
church. 18 When they had come to him, he said to them,
“You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I always spent
my time with you. 19 I kept serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears,
and in sufferings that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews. 20 You know
how I did not keep back from declaring to you anything that was useful, and how
I taught you in public and from house to house, 21 testifying both Jews and Greeks
about repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus. 22 Now look, I am going
to Jerusalem, compelled by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
23 except that the Holy Spirit warns to me in every city that chains and sufferings
await me. 24 But I do not consider my life is valuable to myself, if only I may finish
the race and complete the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to
the gospel of the grace of God. 25 Now look, I know that you all, among whom I went
about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more. 26 Therefore I testify to
you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of any man. 27 For I did not hold back
from declaring to you the whole will of God. 28 Therefore be careful about yourselves,
and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful
to shepherd the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood. * 29 I know
that after my departure, vicious wolves will come in among you and will not spare
the flock. 30 I know that from even among you some men shall come and distort the
truth in order to draw away the disciples after them. 31 So be on guard. Remember
that for three years I did not stop instructing every one of you with tears night and
day. 32 Now I entrust you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build
you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are being sanctified. 33 I
coveted no man's silver, gold, or clothing. 34 You yourselves know that these hands
served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me. 35 In all things I
gave you an example of how you should help the weak by working, and of how you
should remember the words of the Lord Jesus, words that he himself said: “It is more
blessed to give than to receive.”
36 After he had spoken in this way, he knelt down and prayed with them all. 37 There
was a lot of crying and they embraced Paul and kissed him. 38 They were sad most
of all because of what he had said, that they would never see his face again. Then
they escorted him to the ship.
21
1 When we had gone away from them and set sail, we took a straight course to
the city of Cos, and the next day to the city of Rhodes, and from there to the city of
Patara. 2 When we found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set
sail. 3 After sighting Cyprus, leaving it on the left side of the boat, we sailed on to
Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo. 4 After we found
the disciples, we stayed there seven days. Through the Spirit they kept urging Paul
not to go to Jerusalem. 5 When our days there were over, we left and went on our
way, and they all, with their wives and children, accompanied out of the city. Then
we knelt down on the beach, prayed, 6 and said farewell to each other. Then we went
on board the ship, and they returned home.
7 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. There we
greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day. 8 On the next day we left
and went to Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one
* 20:28 Instead of with his own blood , some ancient copies read, with the blood of his own Son .Acts 21:9
1163
Acts 21:36
of the seven, and we stayed with him. 9 Now this man had four virgin daughters
who prophesied. 10 As we stayed there for some days, there came down from Judea
a certain prophet named Agabus. 11 He came to us and took Paul's belt. With it he
tied his own feet and hands and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So shall the Jews in
Jerusalem tie up the man who owns this belt, and they will hand him over into the
hands of the Gentiles.'” 12 When we heard these things, both we and the people who
lived in that place begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered,
“What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to
be tied up, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 14 Since Paul
did not wish to be persuaded, we stopped trying and said, “May the will of the Lord
be done.”
15 After these days, we picked up our bags and went up to Jerusalem. 16 There also
went with us some of the disciples from Caesarea. They brought with them a man
named Mnason, a man from Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.
17 When we had arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly. 18 The
next day Paul went with us to James, and all the elders were present. 19 When he
had greeted them, he reported one by one the things that God had done among the
Gentiles through his ministry. 20 When they heard it, they praised God, and they said
to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands have believed among the Jews. They
are all determined to keep the law. 21 They have been told about you, that you teach
all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, and that you tell them
not to circumcise their children, and not to follow the old customs. 22 What should
we do? They will certainly hear that you have come. 23 So do what we say to you. We
have four men who made a vow. 24 Take these men and purify yourself with them,
and pay their expenses for them, so that they may shave their heads. So everyone
will know that the things they have been told about you are false. They will learn that
you also follow the law. 25 But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote
and gave the instructions that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to
idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.” 26 Then Paul
took the men, and the next day, purifying himself with them, went into the temple,
announcing the period of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for
every one of them.
27 When the seven days were almost finished, some Jews from Asia, seeing Paul in
the temple, stirred up the whole crowd, and laid hands on him. 28 They were shouting,
“Men of Israel, help us. This is the man who teaches all men everywhere things that
are against the people, the law, and this place. Besides, he has also brought Greeks
into the temple and has defiled this holy place.” 29 For they had previously seen
Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they thought that Paul had brought
him into the temple. 30 All the city was excited, and the people ran together and laid
hold of Paul. They dragged him out of the temple, and the doors were immediately
shut. 31 As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the chief captain of the guard
that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. 32 Right away he took soldiers and centurions
and ran down to the crowd. When the people saw the chief captain and the soldiers,
they stopped beating Paul. 33 Then the chief captain approached and laid hold of
Paul, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was
and what he had done. 34 Some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others
another. Since the captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, he ordered
that Paul be brought into the fortress. 35 When he came to the steps, he was carried
by the soldiers because of the crowd's violence. 36 For the crowd of people followed
after and kept shouting out, “Away with him!”Acts 21:37
1164
Acts 22:26
37 As Paul was about to be brought into the fortress, he said to the chief captain,
“May I say something to you?” The captain said, “Do you speak Greek? 38 Are you
not then the Egyptian, who previously led a rebellion and led the four thousand men
of the 'Assassins' out into the wilderness?” 39 Paul said, “I am a Jew, from the city of
Tarsus in Cilicia. I am a citizen of an important city. I ask you, allow me to speak to
the people.” 40 When the captain had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps
and motioned with the hand to the people. When there was a deep silence, he spoke
to them in the Hebrew language. He said,
22
1 “Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense which I will now make to you.”
2 When the crowd heard Paul speak to them in the Hebrew language, they became
quiet. He said,
3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of
Gamaliel. I was instructed according to the strict ways of the law of our fathers. I
am zealous for God, just as all of you are today. 4 I persecuted this Way to the death,
binding up and delivering them to prison both men and women, 5 as the high priest
and all the elders can bear witness. I received letters from them for the brothers
in Damascus, and went there to bring them back in bonds to Jerusalem in order for
them to be punished. 6 It happened that when I was traveling and nearing Damascus,
about noon suddenly a great light from heaven began to shine around me. 7 I fell to
the ground and heard a voice say to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' 8 I
answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are
persecuting.' 9 Those who were with me saw the light, but they did not understand
the voice of him who spoke to me. 10 I said, 'What should I do, Lord?' The Lord said to
me, 'Arise and go into Damascus; there you will be told everything that you must do.'
11 I could not see because of that light's brightness, and being led by the hands of those
who were with me, I came into Damascus. 12 There I met a man named Ananias, a
devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there.
13 He came to me, stood by me, and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' In that
very hour I saw him. 14 Then he said, 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know
his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice coming from his own mouth.
15 For you shall be a witness for him to all men about what you have seen and heard.
16 Now why are you waiting? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling
on his name.' 17 After I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the
temple, it happened that I was given a vision. 18 I saw him say to me, 'Hurry and
leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.' 19 I
said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in
you in every synagogue. 20 When the blood of Stephen your witness was spilled, I
also was standing by and agreeing, and I was guarding the cloaks of those who killed
him.' 21 But he said to me, 'Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'”
22 They listened to him until he said this. Then they shouted and said, “Away
with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not right that he should live.” 23 As they
were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and throwing dust into the air, 24 the chief
captain commanded Paul to be brought into the fortress. He ordered that he should
be questioned with scourging, so that he himself might know why they were shouting
against him like that. 25 When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the
centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman
and who has not been put on trial?” 26 When the centurion heard this, he went to
the chief captain and told him, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is aActs 22:27
1165
Acts 23:21
Roman citizen.” 27 The chief captain came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman
citizen?” Paul said, “Yes.” 28 The chief captain answered, “It was only with a large
amount of money that I acquired citizenship.” But Paul said, “I was born a Roman
citizen.” 29 Then the men who were going to question him left him immediately.
The chief captain also was afraid, when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen,
because he had tied him up.
30 On the next day, the chief captain wanted to know the truth about the Jews'
accusations against Paul. So he untied his bonds and ordered the chief priests and
all the council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and placed him in their midst.
23
1 Paul looked directly at the council members and said, “Brothers, I have lived
before God in all good conscience until this day.” 2 The high priest Ananias
commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 3 Then said Paul to
him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the
law, yet order me to be struck, against the law?” 4 Those who stood by said, “Is this
how you insult God's high priest?” 5 Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was
high priest. For it is written,
You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.”
6 When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other
Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of
Pharisees. It is because I have the certain hope of the resurrection of the dead that
I am being judged.” 7 When he said this, an argument began between the Pharisees
and Sadducees, and the crowd was divided. 8 For the Sadducees say that there is
no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge all of them.
9 So a large uproar occurred, and some of the scribes belonging to the Pharisees stood
up and argued, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an
angel has spoken to him?” 10 When there arose a great argument, the chief captain
feared that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, so he commanded the soldiers to
go down and take him by force from among the council members, and bring him into
the fortress.
11 The following night the Lord stood beside him and said, “Do not be afraid, for as
you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.”
12 When it became day, some Jews formed a conspiracy and called a curse down
upon themselves with an oath not to eat nor drink anything until they had killed
Paul. 13 There were more than forty men who formed this conspiracy. 14 They went
to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have put ourselves under a great
curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul. 15 Now, therefore, let the council tell
the chief captain to bring him down to you, as if you would decide his case more
precisely. As for us, we are ready to kill him before he comes here.” 16 But Paul's
sister's son heard that they were lying in wait, so he went and entered the fortress
and told Paul. 17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man
to the chief captain, for he has something to tell him.” 18 So the centurion took the
young man and brought him to the chief captain and said, “Paul the prisoner called
me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say
to you.” 19 The chief captain took him by the hand to a private place and asked him,
“What is it that you have to tell me?” 20 The young man said, “The Jews have agreed
to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the council, as if they were going to ask
more precisely about his case. 21 But do not give in to them, because there are more
than forty men who are lying in wait for him. They have called a curse down onActs 23:22
1166
Acts 24:14
themselves, neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Even now they are
ready, waiting for consent from you.” 22 So the chief captain let the young man go,
after instructing him, “Tell no one that you have said these things to me.” 23 Then
he called to him two of the centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready to
go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen also, and two hundred spearmen. You
will leave at the third hour of the night.” 24 He also ordered them to provide animals
which Paul could ride, and to take him safely to Felix the governor. 25 Then he wrote
a letter like this:
26 “Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix, greetings. 27 This man was
arrested by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with
soldiers and rescued him, since I learned that he was a Roman citizen. 28 I wanted to
know why they accused him, so I took him down to their council. 29 I learned that he
was being accused about questions concerning their own law, but that there was no
accusation against him that deserved death or imprisonment. 30 Then it was made
known to me that there was a plot against the man, so I immediately sent him to you,
and instructed his accusers also to bring their charges against him in your presence.
Farewell.”
31 So the soldiers obeyed their orders. They took Paul and brought him by night
to Antipatris. 32 On the next day, most of the soldiers left the horsemen to go with
him and they themselves returned to the fortress. 33 When the horsemen reached
Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
34 When the governor read the letter, he asked what province Paul was from. When
he learned that he was from Cilicia, 35 he said, “I will hear you fully when your
accusers come here.” Then he commanded him to be kept in Herod's government
headquarters.
24
1 After five days, Ananias the chief priest, certain elders, and an orator named
Tertullus went there. These men brought charges against Paul before the governor.
2 When Paul stood before the governor, Tertullus began to accuse him and said to
the governor, “Because of you we have great peace, and your foresight brings good
reform to our nation;
3 so with all thankfulness we welcome everything that you do, most excellent Felix.
4 So that I detain you no more, I ask you to briefly listen to me with kindness. 5 For
we have found this man to be a pest and one who causes all the Jews throughout the
world to rebel. He is a leader of the Nazarene sect. 6 He even tried to desecrate the
temple, so we arrested him. * 7 † 8 When you question Paul about all these matters,
you will be able to learn about these charges we are bringing against him.” ‡ 9 The
Jews also joined in the accusation, affirming that these charges were true.
10 But when the governor motioned for Paul to speak, Paul answered, “I understand
that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, and so I gladly explain
myself to you.
11 You will be able to find out that it has not been more than twelve days since I
went up to worship in Jerusalem. 12 When they found me in the temple, I did not
argue with anyone, and I did not stir up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the
city. 13 They cannot prove to you the accusations they are now making against me.
14 But I admit this to you, that according to the Way that they call a sect, in that same

way I serve the God of our fathers. I am faithful to all that is in the law and the
writings of the prophets. 15 I have the same confident hope in God as these men, that
there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 16 So I always strive
to have a clear conscience before God and human beings. 17 Now after many years I
came to bring help to my nation and gifts of money. 18 When I did this, certain Jews
from Asia found me in a purification ceremony in the temple, not with a crowd or an
uproar. 19 These men ought to be before you now and say what they have against me,
if they have anything. 20 Or else, these same men should say what wrong they found
in me when I stood before the Jewish council, 21 unless it is about this one thing that
I shouted out when I stood among them, 'It is concerning the resurrection of those
who have died that I am on trial before you today.'”
22 Then Felix, who was well informed about the Way, ajourned the hearing. He said,
“When Lysias the commander comes down from Jerusalem, I will decide your case.”
23 Then he commanded the centurion that Paul should be kept under guard, but to
have some freedom so that none of his friends would be prevented from attending
to his needs.
24 After some days, Felix returned with Drusilla his wife, a Jewess, and he sent for
Paul and he heard from him about faith in Christ Jesus. 25 But when Paul reasoned
with him about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became
frightened and said, “Go away for now. But when I have the opportunity later on, I
will send for you.” 26 At the same time he wanted Paul to give money to him, so he
often sent for him and spoke with him. 27 But when two years passed, Porcius Festus
became the governor after Felix, but Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jews, so he
left Paul to continue under guard.
25
1 Now, Festus entered the province, and after three days, he went from Caesarea up
to Jerusalem. 2 The chief priest and the prominent Jews brought accusations against
Paul, and they urged him 3 and asked him for a favor that would put Paul in danger—
that Festus might summon Paul to Jerusalem so that they could kill him along the way.
4 Festus answered that Paul was being held at Caesarea, and that he himself was going
there soon. 5 “Therefore, those who can,” he said, “should go there with us. If there
is something wrong with the man, you should accuse him.”
6 Festus stayed not more than eight or ten days and then he went down to Caesarea,
and on the next day he sat in the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought
to him. 7 When he arrived, the Jews from Jerusalem stood nearby, and they brought
many serious charges which they could not prove. 8 Paul defended himself and said, “I
have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against
Caesar.” 9 But Festus wanted to gain the favor of the Jews, and so he answered Paul
and said, “Do you want to go up to Jerusalem and to be judged by me about these
things there?” 10 Paul said, “I stand before the judgment seat of Caesar where I must
be judged. I have wronged no Jews, just as you also very well know. 11 Though if I
have done wrong and if I have done what is worthy of death, I do not refuse to die.
But if their accusations are nothing, no one may hand me over to them. I appeal to
Caesar.” 12 After Festus talked with the council, he answered, “You have appealed to
Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”
13 Now after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay an
official visit to Festus. 14 After he had been there for many days, Festus presented
Paul's case to the king; he said, “A certain man was left behind here by Felix as
a prisoner. 15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of theActs 25:16
1168
Acts 26:15
Jews brought charges against this man to me, and they asked for a sentence of
condemnation against him. 16 I answered them that it was not the custom of the
Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had faced his accusers and had
an opportunity to defend himself against the charges. 17 Therefore, when they came
together here, I did not wait, but the next day I sat in the judgment seat and I ordered
the man to be brought in. 18 When the accusers stood up and accused him, I thought
that none of the charges that they brought against him were serious. 19 Instead, they
had certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who
was dead, whom Paul claims to be alive. 20 I was not certain about how to investigate
this matter, and so I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial there
about these charges. 21 But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody while awaiting
the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send
him to Caesar.” 22 Agrippa spoke to Festus, “I would also like to listen to this man.”
“Tomorrow,” Festus said, “you will hear him.”
23 So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much ceremony; they came
into the hall with the military officers and with the prominent men of the city. When
Festus spoke the command, Paul was brought to them. 24 Festus said, “King Agrippa,
and all you men who are here with us, you see this man; all the multitude of Jews
consulted with me in Jerusalem and here also, and they shouted to me that he should
no longer live. 25 I learned that he had done nothing worthy of death; but because
he appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him. 26 But I do not have something
definite to write to the emperor. For this reason, I have brought him to you, especially
to you, King Agrippa, so that I might have something more to write about the case.
27 For it seems unreasonable for me to send a prisoner and to not also state the charges
against him.”
26
1 So Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak for yourself.”
Then Paul stretched out
his hand and made his defense.
2 “I regard myself as happy, King Agrippa, to make my case before you today against
all the accusations of the Jews; 3 especially, because you are an expert in all the Jewish
customs and questions. So I ask you to hear me patiently. 4 Truly, all the Jews know
how I lived from my youth in my own nation and at Jerusalem. 5 They knew me
from the beginning and they should admit that I lived as a Pharisee, the strictest
party of our religion. 6 Now I stand here to be judged because of my certain hope
in the promise made by God to our fathers. 7 For this is the promise that our twelve
tribes sought to receive as they earnestly worshiped God night and day. It is for this
certain hope, King Agrippa, that the Jews accuse me. 8 Why should any of you think it
is unbelievable that God raises the dead? 9 Now indeed, I myself thought that I should
do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 10 I did these in Jerusalem.
I locked up many of the saints in prison by the authority I received from the chief
priests, and when they were killed, I cast my vote against them. 11 I punished them
many times in all the synagogues and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was
furiously enraged against them and I persecuted them even to foreign cities. 12 While
I was doing this, I went to Damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests;
13 and on the way there, at midday, King, I saw a light from heaven that was brighter
than the sun and it shone around both me and the men who were traveling with me.
14 When we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me that said in the
Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick a
goad.' 15 Then I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' The Lord replied, 'I am Jesus whom youActs 26:16
1169
Acts 27:12
persecute. 16 Now get up and stand on your feet; because for this purpose I appeared
to you, to appoint you to be a servant and a witness concerning the things that you
know about me now and the things that I will show to you later; 17 and I will rescue
you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you, 18 to open
their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to
God, so that they may receive from God the forgiveness of sins and the inheritance
that I give to them who are sanctified by faith in me.' 19 Therefore, King Agrippa, I
did not disobey the heavenly vision; 20 but, to those in Damascus first, and then at
Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, I gave
them the message that that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy
of repentance. 21 For this cause the Jews arrested me in the temple and tried to kill
me. 22 God has helped me until now, so I stand and testify to the common people and
to the great ones about nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would
happen— 23 that Christ must suffer and that by being the first to rise from the dead,
he would proclaim light to our own people and to the Gentiles.”
24 As Paul completed his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are
insane; your great learning makes you insane.” 25 But Paul said, “I am not insane,
most excellent Festus, but what I am declaring is true and rational. 26 For the king
knows about these things; and so, I speak freely to him, for I am persuaded that none
of this is hidden from him; for this has not been done in a corner. 27 Do you believe
the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.” 28 Agrippa said to Paul, “In a
short time would you persuade me and make me a Christian?” 29 Paul said, “I pray
to God, that whether in a short or long time, not you only, but also all that hear me
today, would be like me, but without these prison chains.”
30 Then the king stood up, and the governor, and Bernice also, and those who were
sitting with them; 31 when they left the hall, they talked to one another and said, “This
man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.” 32 Agrippa said to Festus, “This man
could have been freed if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
27
1 When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they put Paul and some other
prisoners under the charge of a centurion named Julius of the Imperial Regiment.
2 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail along the coast of
Asia. So we went to sea. Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia went with
us. 3 The next day we landed at the city of Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly
and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care. 4 From there we went to
sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, close to the island, because the winds were
against us. 5 Then we had sailed across the sea and were near the coast of Cilicia
and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra, a city of Lycia. 6 There, the centurion found a
ship from Alexandria that was going to sail to Italy. He put us in it. 7 When we had
sailed slowly for many days and had finally arrived with difficulty near Cnidus, the
wind no longer allowed us to go that way, so we sailed along the sheltered side of
Crete, opposite Salmone. 8 We sailed along the coast with difficulty, until we came to
a certain place called Fair Havens, which is near the city of Lasea.
9 We had now taken much time, the time of the Jewish fast also had passed, and
it had now become dangerous to sail. So Paul warned them, 10 and said, “Men, I see
that the voyage we are about to take will be with injury and much loss, not only of
the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” 11 But the centurion paid more attention
to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things that were spoken by
Paul. 12 Because the harbor was not easy to spend the winter in, most of the sailorsActs 27:13
1170
Acts 27:43
advised to sail from there, if by any means we could reach the city of Phoenix, to
spend the winter there. Phoenix is a harbor in Crete, and it faces northeast and
southeast. 13 When the south wind began to blow gently, the sailors thought that they
had what they needed. So they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the
shore. 14 But after a short time a wind of hurricane force, called the northeaster,
began to beat down from the island. 15 When the ship was caught by the storm and
could no longer head into the wind, we had to give way to the storm and were driven
along by the wind. 16 We sailed along the lee of a small island called Cauda, and with
difficulty we were able to secure the lifeboat. 17 When they had hoisted the lifeboat
up, they used its ropes to bind the hull of the ship. They were afraid that they should
run upon the sandbars of Syrtis, so they lowered the sea anchor and were driven
along. 18 We took such a violent battering by the storm that the next day they began
throwing the cargo overboard. 19 On the third day the sailors threw overboard the
ship's equipment with their own hands. 20 When the sun and stars did not shine on us
for many days, and the great storm still beat upon us, any more hope that we should
be saved was abandoned. 21 When they had gone long without food, then Paul stood
up among the sailors and said, “Men, you should have listened to me, and not have
set sail from Crete, so as to get this injury and loss. 22 Now I urge you to take courage,
for there will be no loss of life among you, but only the loss of the ship. 23 For last
night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom also I worship—his angel stood
beside me 24 and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and see,
God in his kindness has given to you all those who are sailing with you.' 25 Therefore
be cheerful, men! For I trust God that it will happen just as it was told to me. 26 But
we must run aground upon some island.”
27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven this way and that in the
Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they were approaching some
land. 28 They took soundings and found twenty fathoms; after a little while, they took
more soundings and found fifteen fathoms. 29 They were afraid that we might crash
on the rocks, so they lowered four anchors from the stern and prayed that morning
would come soon. 30 The sailors were looking for a way to abandon the ship and
had lowered the lifeboat into the sea, and pretended that they would throw down the
anchors from the bow. 31 But Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless
these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” 32 Then the soldiers cut away the
ropes of the boat and let it drift away. 33 When daylight was coming on, Paul urged
them all to take some food. He said, “This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and
do not eat; you have eaten nothing. 34 So I urge you to share some food, for this is
necessary for you to survive. For not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.”
35 When he had said this, he took bread and he thanked God in the sight of everyone.
Then he broke the bread and began to eat. 36 Then they were all encouraged and
they also took food. 37 We were 276 people in the ship. 38 When they had eaten
enough, they made the ship lighter by throwing out the wheat into the sea. 39 When
it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach, and they
discussed whether they could drive the ship onto it. 40 So they cut loose the anchors
and left them in the sea. At the same time they loosed the ropes of the rudders and
raised the foresail to the wind; and so they headed to the beach. 41 But they came to
a place where two currents met, and the ship ran into the ground. The bow of the
ship stuck there and remained unmovable, but the stern began to break up because
of the waves' violence. 42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of
them could swim away and escape. 43 But the centurion wanted to save Paul, so he
stopped their plan; and he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard firstActs 27:44
1171
Acts 28:24
and get to land. 44 Then the rest of the men should follow, some on planks, and some
on other things from the ship. In this way it happened that all of us came safely to
land.
28
1 When we were brought safely through, we learned that the island was called
Malta. 2 The native people offered to us not just ordinary kindness, but they lit a fire
and welcomed us all, because of the constant rain and cold. 3 But when Paul had
gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, a viper came out because
of the heat, and fastened onto his hand. 4 When the native people saw the animal
hanging from his hand, they said one to another, “This man certainly is a murderer
who escaped from the sea, yet justice does not permit him to live.” 5 But then he
shook the animal into the fire and suffered no harm. 6 They were waiting for him
to become inflamed with a fever or to suddenly drop dead. But after they watched
him for a long time and saw that nothing was unusual with him, they changed their
minds and said that he was a god.
7 Now in a nearby place there were lands belonging to the chief man of the island,
a man named Publius. He welcomed us and kindly provided for us for three days.
8 It happened that the father of Publius had been made ill with a fever and dysentery.
When Paul went to him, he prayed, placed his hands on him, and healed him. 9 After
this happened, the rest of the people on the island who were sick also came and were
healed. 10 The people also honored us with many honors. When we were preparing
to sail, they gave us what we needed.
11 After three months we set sail in an ship that had spent the winter at the island,
a ship of Alexandria, with “the twin gods” as it figurehead. 12 After we landed at the
city of Syracuse, we stayed there three days. 13 From there we sailed and arrived at
the city of Rhegium. After one day a south wind sprang up, and in two days we came
to the city of Puteoli. 14 There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with
them for seven days. In this way we came to Rome. 15 From there the brothers, after
they heard about us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three
Taverns. When Paul saw the brothers, he thanked God and took courage.
16 When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier
who was guarding him.
17 Then it came about that after three days Paul called together those men who
were the leaders among the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them,
“Brothers, although I have done nothing wrong against the people or the customs
of our fathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the
Romans. 18 After they questioned me, they wished to set me free, because there was
no reason in me for a death penalty. 19 But when the Jews spoke against their desire, I
was forced to appeal to Caesar, although it is not as if I were bringing any accusation
against my nation. 20 Because of my appeal, then, I have asked to see you and to
speak with you. It is because of the certain hope of Israel that I am bound with this
chain.” 21 Then they said to him, “We neither received letters from Judea about you,
nor did any of the brothers come and report or say anything bad about you. 22 But
we want to hear from you what you think about this sect, because it is known by us
that it is spoken against everywhere.”
23 When they had set a day for him, more people came to him at his dwelling place.
He presented the matter to them, and testified about the kingdom of God. He tried to
persuade them about Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from
morning until evening. 24 Some were convinced about the things which were said,Acts 28:25
1172
Acts 28:31
while others did not believe. 25 When they did not agree with one another, they left
after Paul had spoken this one word, “The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the
prophet to your fathers. 26 He said, 'Go to this people and say,
“By hearing you will hear, but not understand;
and seeing you will see, but will not perceive.
27 For the heart of this people has become dull,
and with their ears they hardly hear,
and they have shut their eyes.
Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
and hear with their ears,
and understand with their heart and turn again,
and I would heal them.”'
28 Therefore, you should know that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles,
and they will listen.” 29 *
30 Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house, and he welcomed all
who came to him. 31 He was proclaiming the kingdom of God and was teaching the
things about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness. No one stopped him.

were having a great dispute among themselves .Romans 1:1

1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel
of God, 2 which he promised beforehand by his prophets in the holy scriptures,
3 concerning his Son who was a descendant of David according to the flesh. 4 Through
the Spirit of holiness he was declared with power to be the Son of God by the
resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord. 5 Through him we have received
grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the nations, for the sake of
his name. 6 Among these nations, you also have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
7 This letter is to all who are in Rome, the beloved of God, who are called to be holy
people. May grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is
proclaimed throughout the whole world. 9 For God is my witness, whom I serve in
my spirit in the gospel of his Son, of how continually I make mention of you. 10 I
always request in my prayers that by any means I may at last be successful now by
the will of God in coming to you. 11 For I desire to see you, that I may give you some
spiritual gift, in order to strengthen you. 12 That is, I long to be mutually encouraged
among you, through each other's faith, yours and mine. 13 Now I do not want you to
be uninformed, brothers, that I often intended to come to you, (but I was hindered
until now), in order to have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the rest
of the Gentiles. 14 I am a debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise
and to the foolish. 15 So, as for me, I am ready to proclaim the gospel also to you who
are in Rome.
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation
for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and for the Greek. 17 For in it God's
righteousness is revealed from faith to faith, as it has been written, “The righteous
will live by faith.”
18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of people, who through unrighteousness hold back the truth. 19 This
is because that which is known about God is visible to them. For God has enlightened
them. 20 For his invisible qualities, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have
been clearly seen, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been
made. So they are without excuse. 21 This is because, although they knew about God,
they did not glorify him as God, nor did they give him thanks. Instead, they became
foolish in their thoughts, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 22 They claimed
to be wise, but they became foolish. 23 They exchanged the glory of the imperishable
God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man, of birds, of four-footed beasts,
and of creeping things.
24 Therefore God gave them over to the lusts of their hearts for uncleanness, for
their bodies to be dishonored among themselves. 25 It is they who exchanged the
truth of God for a lie, and who worshiped and served the creation instead of the
Creator, who is praised forever. Amen.
26 Because of this, God gave them over to dishonorable passions, for their women
exchanged natural relations for those that were unnatural. 27 Likewise, the men
also left their natural relations with women and burned in their lust for one another.
These were men who committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves
the penalty they deserved for their error.Romans 1:28
1174
Romans 2:26
28 Because they did not approve of having God in their awareness, he gave them
up to a depraved mind, for them to do those things that are not proper. 29 They have
been filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, and malice. They are
full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and evil intentions. They are gossips, 30 slanderers,
haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventing ways of doing evil; they are
disobedient to parents. 31 They are senseless, faithless, heartless, and unmerciful.
32 They understand the regulations of God, that those who practice such things are
deserving of death. But not only do they do these things, they also approve of others
who do them.
2
1 Therefore you are without excuse, you person, you who judge, for what you
judge in another you condemn in yourself. For you who judge practice the same
things. 2 But we know that God's judgment is according to truth when it falls on
those who practice such things. 3 But consider this, you person, you who judge those
who practice such things although you do the same things. Will you escape from
the judgment of God? 4 Or do you think so little of the riches of his goodness, his
delayed punishment, and his patience? Do you not know that his goodness is meant
to lead you to repentance? 5 But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant
heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, that is, the day
of the revelation of God's righteous judgment. 6 He will pay back to every person
according to his actions: 7 to those who according to consistent, good actions have
sought praise, honor, and incorruptibility, he will give eternal life. 8 But to those who
are self-seeking, who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness, wrath and fierce
anger will come. 9 God will bring tribulation and distress on every human soul that
has practiced evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 10 But praise, honor, and
peace will come to everyone who practices good, to the Jew first, and also to the
Greek. 11 For there is no favoritism with God. 12 For as many as have sinned without
the law will also perish without the law, and as many as have sinned with respect
to the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are
righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be justified. 14 For when
Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, they are a
law to themselves, although they do not have the law. 15 By this they show that the
actions required by the law are written in their hearts. Their conscience also bears
witness to them, and their own thoughts either accuse or defend them to themselves
16 and also to God. That will happen on the day when God will judge the secrets of
all people, according to my gospel, through Jesus Christ.
17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rest upon the law and boast in God, 18 and know
his will and approve of what is excellent because you have been instructed from the
law; 19 and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to
those who are in darkness, 20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of little children, and
that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth, then how does this
affect the way you live your life? 21 You who teach others, do you not teach yourself?
You who preach against stealing, do you steal? 22 You who say that one must not
commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who hate idols, do you rob temples?
23 You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? 24 For “the
name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” just as it has been
written. 25 For circumcision indeed benefits you if you obey the law, but if you break
the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. 26 If, then, the uncircumcised
person keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be consideredRomans 2:27
1175
Romans 3:26
as circumcision? 27 And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn
you if he keeps the law? This is because you have the written law and circumcision,
yet you break the law! 28 For he is not a Jew who is merely one outwardly; neither
is circumcision that which is merely outward in the flesh. 29 But he is a Jew who is
one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter. The
praise of such a person comes not from people but from God.
3
1 Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?
2 It is great in every way. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with revelation from
God. 3 For what if some Jews were without faith? Will their unbelief abolish God's
faithfulness? 4 May it never be. Instead, let God be found to be true, even though
every man is a liar. As it has been written,
“That you might be shown to be righteous in your words,
and that you might prevail when you come into judgment.”
5 But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? Can
we say that God is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us? (I am using a human
argument.) 6 May it never be! For then how would God judge the world? 7 But if the
truth of God through my lie provides abundant praise for him, why am I still being
judged as a sinner? 8 Why not say, as we are falsely reported to say, and as some
affirm that we say, “Let us do evil, so that good may come”? The judgment on them
is just.
9 What then? Are we excusing ourselves? Not at all. For we have already accused
both Jews and Greeks, all of them, of being under sin. 10 This is as it is written:
“There is no one righteous, not one.
11 There is no one who understands.
There is no one who seeks after God.
12 They have all turned away. They together have become useless.
There is no one who does good, no, not even one.”
13 “Their throat is an open grave.
Their tongues have deceived.
The poison of snakes is under their lips.”
14 “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
15 “Their feet are swift to pour out blood.
16 Destruction and suffering are in their paths.
17 These people have not known a way of peace.”
18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to the ones who are under
the law. This is in order that every mouth may be shut, and the whole world held
accountable to God. 20 This is because no flesh will be justified by the works of the
law in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
21 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known.
It was witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 that is, the righteousness of God
through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe. For there is no distinction.
23 For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, 24 and they are freely
justified by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. 25 For God
provided Christ Jesus as a propitiation through faith in his blood. He offered Christ as
proof of his justice, because of his disregard of previous sins 26 in his patience. This
all happened for the demonstration of his righteousness at this present time. ThisRomans 3:27
1176
Romans 4:24
was so he could prove himself just, and to show that he justifies anyone because of
faith in Jesus.
27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. On what grounds? Of works? No, but on
the grounds of faith. 28 We conclude then that a person is justified by faith without
works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not also the God of Gentiles?
Yes, of Gentiles also. 30 If, indeed, God is one, he will justify the circumcision by faith,
and the uncircumcision through faith.
31 Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! Instead, we uphold
the law.
4
1 What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, found?
2 For if Abraham had been justified by works, he would have had a reason to boast,
but not before God. 3 For what does the scripture say? “Abraham believed God,
and it was counted to him as righteousness.” 4 Now for him who works, what he
is paid is not counted as a gift, but as what is owed. 5 But for him who does not
work but instead believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted
as righteousness. 6 David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts
righteousness without works. 7 He said,
“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,
and whose sins are covered.
8 Blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count sin.”
9 Then is this blessing pronounced only on those of the circumcision, or also on those
of the uncircumcision? For we say, “Faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.”
10 So how was it counted? When Abraham was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?
It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 11 Abraham received the sign of
circumcision. This was a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had already
possessed when he was in uncircumcision. The result of this sign was that he became
the father of all those who believe, even if they are in uncircumcision. This means that
righteousness will be counted for them. 12 This also meant that Abraham became the
father of the circumcision for those who are not only circumcised but also for those
who follow in the steps of faith of our father Abraham before he was circumcised.
13 For the promise to Abraham and to his descendants that he would be heir of the
world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. 14 For if
those who live by the law are to be the heirs, faith is made empty, and the promise
is void. 15 For the law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, there is no
trespass. 16 For this reason it is by faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace
and be guaranteed to all of Abraham's descendants—not only to those who are under
the law, but also to those who share the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all,
17 as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations.” Abraham was in the
presence of him whom he trusted, that is, God, who gives life to the dead and calls
the things that do not exist into existence. 18 In hope he believed against hope, that
he would become the father of many nations, according to what he had been told,
“So will your descendants be.” 19 Without becoming weak in faith, he considered his
own body as dead (because he was about a hundred years old)—and he considered
the deadness of Sarah's womb. 20 But because of God's promise, Abraham did not
hesitate in unbelief. Instead, he was strengthened in faith and gave praise to God.
21 He was fully convinced that what God had promised, he was also able to accomplish.
22 Therefore this was also counted to him as righteousness. 23 Now it was not written
only for his benefit, that it was counted for him. 24 It was written also for us, forRomans 4:25
1177
Romans 6:8
whom it will be counted, we who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the
dead. 25 This is the one who was delivered up for our trespasses and was raised for
our justification.
5
1 Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ. 2 Through him we also have our access by faith into this grace in which
we stand, and we rejoice in the certain hope of the glory of God. 3 Not only this,
but we also rejoice in our sufferings. We know that suffering produces endurance.
4 Endurance produces character, and character produces certain hope, 5 and that hope
does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through
the Holy Spirit who was given to us. 6 For while we were still weak, at the right time
Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For one will hardly die for a righteous man. That is,
perhaps someone would dare to die for a good person. 8 But God proves his own love
toward us, because while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more, then,
now that we are justified by his blood, we will be saved by it from the wrath of God.
10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his
Son, much more, after having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 11 Not
only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom
we now have received this reconciliation.
12 So then, as through one man sin entered into the world, in this way death entered
through sin. And death spread to all people, because all sinned. 13 For until the
law, sin was in the world, but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law.
14 Nevertheless, death ruled from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin
like Adam's disobedience, who is a pattern of him who was to come.
15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of one the many died,
how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man,
Jesus Christ, abound for the many! 16 For the gift is not like the outcome of that one
man's sin. The judgment followed one trespass and brought condemnation, but the
gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 17 For if, by the trespass of
the one, death ruled through the one, how much more will those who receive the
abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus
Christ. 18 So then, by one trespass condemnation came to all people, so also one act
of righteousness leads to justification and life for all people. 19 For as through the
one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience
of the one will the many be made righteous. 20 But the law came in to increase the
trespass. But where sin abounded, grace abounded even more. 21 This happened
so that, as sin ruled in death, even so grace might rule through righteousness for
everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 What then will we say?
6
Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound?
2 May it never be. We who died to sin, how can we still live in it? 3 Do you not know
that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We
were buried, then, with him through baptism into death. This happened in order that
just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we might
walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have become united with him in the likeness
of his death, we will also be united with his resurrection. 6 We know this, that our
old man was crucified with him, in order that the body of sin might be destroyed.
This happened so that we should no longer be enslaved to sin. 7 He who has died is
declared righteous with respect to sin. 8 But if we have died with Christ, we believeRomans 6:9
1178
Romans 7:12
that we will also live together with him. 9 We know that since Christ has been raised
from the dead he cannot die again; death no longer has authority over him. 10 For in
regard to the death that he died to sin, he died once for all. However, the life that he
lives, he lives for God. 11 In the same way, you also must consider yourselves to be
dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
12 Therefore do not let sin rule in your mortal body in order that you may obey
its lusts. 13 Do not present the parts of your body to sin, to be tools used for
unrighteousness. But present yourselves to God, as those who have been brought
from death to life, and present the parts of your body to God as tools to be used for
righteousness. 14 Do not allow sin to rule over you. For you are not under law, but
under grace.
15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May
it never be. 16 Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as
slaves is the one to which you are obedient, the one you must obey? This is true
whether you are slaves to sin which leads to death, or slaves to obedience which
leads to righteousness. 17 But thanks be to God! For you were slaves of sin, but you
have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching that you were given. 18 You have
been made free from sin, and you have been made slaves of righteousness. 19 I speak
like a man because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented the parts
of your body as slaves to uncleanness and to evil, in the same way now, present the
parts of your body as slaves to righteousness for sanctification. 20 For when you were
slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness. 21 At that time, what fruit then did
you have of the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those
things is death. 22 But now that you have been made free from sin and are enslaved
to God, you have your fruit for sanctification. The result is eternal life. 23 For the
wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
7
1 Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to people who know about law),
that the law controls a person for as long as he lives? 2 For the married woman is
bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is released
from the law of marriage. 3 So then, while her husband is living, if she lives with
another man, she will be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free
from the law, so she is not an adulteress if she lives with another man. 4 Therefore,
my brothers, you were also made dead to the law through the body of Christ. This is
so that you could be joined to another, that is, to him who was raised from the dead,
in order that we might produce fruit for God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, the
sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for
death. 6 But now we have been released from the law. We have died to that by which
we were held. This is so that we might serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in
oldness of the letter.
7 What will we say then? Is the law itself sin? May it never be. However, I would
never have known sin, if it were not through the law. For I would not have known
covetousness unless the law said, “You must not covet.” 8 But sin took the opportunity
through the commandment and brought about every lust in me. For without the law,
sin is dead. 9 At one time I was alive without the law, but when the commandment
came, sin regained life, and I died. 10 The commandment that was to bring life turned
out to be death for me. 11 For sin took the opportunity through the commandment
and deceived me. Through the commandment it killed me. 12 So the law is holy, and
the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.Romans 7:13
1179
Romans 8:20
13 So did what is good become death to me?
May it never be. But sin, in order
that it might be shown to be sin through what is good, brought about death in me.
This was in order that through the commandment, sin might become sinful beyond
measure. 14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh. I have been
sold under slavery to sin. 15 For what I do, I do not really understand. For what I
want to do, I do not do, and what I hate, I do. 16 But if I do what I do not want, I agree
with the law that the law is good. 17 But now it is no longer I who do it, but the sin
that lives in me. 18 For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, lives no good thing. For
the desire for good is with me, but I cannot do it. 19 For the good that I want I do not
do, but the evil that I do not want, that I do. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do,
then it is no longer I who am acting, but rather sin that lives in me. 21 I find, then,
the principle in me that I want to do what is good, but that evil is actually present
in me. 22 For I rejoice in the law of God with the inner man. 23 But I see a different
principle in my body parts. It fights against that new principle in my mind. It takes
me captive by the principle of sin that is in my body parts. 24 I am a miserable man!
Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 But thanks be to God through Jesus
Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind. However, with
the flesh I serve the principle of sin.
8
1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2 For
the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and
death. 3 For what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh,
God did. He sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be an offering for sin,
and he condemned sin in the flesh. 4 He did this in order that the requirements of the
law might be fulfilled in us, we who walk not according to the flesh, but according
to the Spirit. 5 Those who live according to the flesh pay attention to the things of
the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit pay attention to the things of the
Spirit. 6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life
and peace. 7 The mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God, for it is not subject to
God's law, nor is it able to do so. 8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is true that God's Spirit lives
in you. But if someone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.
10 If Christ is in you, the body is dead with respect to sin, but the spirit is alive with
respect to righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives
in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life also to your mortal bodies
through his Spirit, who lives in you.
12 So then, brothers, we are debtors, but not to the flesh to live according to the
flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die, but if by the Spirit
you put to death the body's actions, you will live. 14 For as many as are led by the
Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 You did not receive a spirit that makes you
slaves, so that you live in fear again; but you received the Spirit of adoption, by which
we cry, “Abba, Father!” 16 The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we
are children of God. 17 If we are children, then we are also heirs, heirs of God. And
we are joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be
glorified with him.
18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory that will be revealed to us. 19 For the eager expectation
of the creation waits for the revealing of the sons of God. 20 For the creation was
subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in theRomans 8:21
1180
Romans 9:11
certain hope 21 that the creation itself will be delivered from slavery to decay, and
that it will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 22 For we
know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain together even now. 23 Not
only that, but even we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit—even we
ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our
body. 24 For in this certain hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope.
For who hopes for what he can see? 25 But if we have certain hope about what we
do not see, we wait for it with patience.
26 In the same way, the Spirit also helps in our weakness. For we do not know how
we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groans.
27 He who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes on
behalf of the saints according to the will of God. 28 We know that for those who love
God, he works all things together for good, * for those who are called according to his
purpose. 29 Because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to
the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. 30 Those
whom he predestined, these he also called. Those whom he called, these he also
justified. Those whom he justified, these he also glorified.
31 What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
32 He who did not spare his own Son but delivered him up on behalf of us all, how
will he not also with him freely give us all things? 33 Who will bring any accusation
against God's chosen ones? God is the one who justifies. 34 Who is the one who
condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who
is at the right hand of God, and who also is interceding for us. 35 Who will separate
us from the love of Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or
nakedness, or danger, or sword? 36 Just as it is written,
“For your benefit we are killed all day long.
We were considered as sheep for the slaughter.”
37 In all these things we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us.
38 For I have been convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor governments,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39 nor height, nor depth, nor any
other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.
9
1 I tell the truth in Christ. I do not lie, and my conscience bears witness with me in
the Holy Spirit, 2 that for me there is great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
3 For I could wish that I myself would be cursed and set apart from Christ for the sake
of my brothers, those of my own race according to the flesh. 4 They are Israelites.
They have adoption, the glory, the covenants, the gift of the law, the worship of God,
and the promises. 5 Theirs are the ancestors from whom Christ has come with respect
to the flesh—he who is God over all. May he be praised forever. Amen.
6 But it is not as though the promises of God have failed. For it is not everyone in
Israel who truly belongs to Israel. 7 Neither are all Abraham's descendants truly his
children. But, “It is through Isaac that your descendants will be called.” 8 That is,
the children of the flesh are not the children of God. But the children of the promise
are regarded as descendants. 9 For this is the word of promise: “At this time I will
come, and a son will be given to Sarah.” 10 Not only this, but after Rebekah also had
conceived by one man, our father Isaac— 11 for the children were not yet born and
* 8:28 Instead of he works all things together for good , some older versions read, all things work together for
good .Romans 9:12
1181
Romans 10:5
had not yet done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to choice
might stand, not because of actions, but because of him who calls— 12 it was said to
her, “The older will serve the younger.” 13 It is just as had been written: “Jacob I
loved, but Esau I hated.”
14 What then will we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be.
15 For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will
have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” 16 So then, it is not because of
him who wills, nor because of him who runs, but because of God, who shows mercy.
17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I raised you up, so that I
might demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in
all the earth.” 18 So then, God has mercy on whom he wishes, and whom he wishes,
he makes stubborn.
19 You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who has ever withstood
his will?” 20 On the contrary, man, who are you who answers against God? Will what
has been molded say to the one who molds it, “Why did you make me this way?”
21 Does the potter not have the right over the clay to make from the same lump a
container for special use, and another container for daily use? 22 What if God, who is
willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience
containers of wrath prepared for destruction? 23 What if he did this in order that he
might make known the riches of his glory upon containers of mercy, which he had
previously prepared for glory? 24 What if he did this also for us, whom he also called,
not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles? 25 As he says also
in Hosea:
“I will call my people who were not my people,
and her beloved who was not beloved.
26 Then it will be that where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,'
there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'”
27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,
“Though the number of the children of Israel were as the sand of the sea,
it will be a remnant that will be saved,
28 for the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth,
completely and without delay.”
29 As Isaiah had said previously,
“If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants,
we would be like Sodom,
and we would have become like Gomorrah.”
30 What will we say then? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness,
obtained righteousness, the righteousness by faith. 31 But Israel, who did pursue a
law of righteousness, did not arrive at it. 32 Why not? Because they did not pursue it
by faith, but by works. They stumbled over the stone of stumbling, 33 as it has been
written,
“Look, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.
He who believes in it will not be ashamed.”
10
1 Brothers, my heart's desire and my request to God is for them, for their salvation.
2 For
I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge. 3 For they do not know of God's righteousness, and they seek to establish
their own righteousness. They did not submit to the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ
is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes. 5 For Moses
writes about the righteousness that comes from the law: “The man who does theRomans 10:6
1182
Romans 11:10
righteousness of the law will live by this righteousness.” 6 But the righteousness that
comes from faith says this, “Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'
(that is, to bring Christ down); 7 and do not say, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'”
(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 8 But what does it say?
“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.”
That is the word of faith, which we proclaim. 9 For if with your mouth you
acknowledge Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the
dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and
with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation. 11 For scripture says, “Everyone who
believes on him will not be put to shame.” 12 For there is no difference between Jew
and Greek. For the same Lord is Lord of all, and he is rich to all who call upon him.
13 For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. 14 How then can
they call on him in whom they have not believed? How can they believe in him of
whom they have not heard? How can they hear without a preacher? 15 Then how
can they preach, unless they are sent?—As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet
of those who proclaim glad tidings of good things!”
16 But they did not all listen to the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed
our message?” 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
18 But I say, “Did they not hear?” Yes, most certainly.
“Their sound has gone out into all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the world.”
19 Moreover, I say, “Did Israel not know?” First Moses says,
“I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation.
By means of a nation without understanding, I will stir you up to anger.”
20 Then Isaiah was very bold when he says,
“I was found by those who did not seek me.
I appeared to those who did not ask for me.”
21 But to Israel he says, “All the day long I reached out my hands to a disobedient and
stubborn people.”
11
1 I say then, did God reject his people? May it never be. For I also am an Israelite,
a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God did not reject his people,
whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he
pleaded with God against Israel? 3 “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have
broken down your altars. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.” 4 But what
does God's answer say to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who
have not bent the knee to Baal.” 5 Even so then, at this present time also there is a
remnant because of the choice of grace. 6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works.
Otherwise grace would no longer be grace. * 7 What then? The thing that Israel was
seeking, it did not obtain, but the chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
8 It is just as it is written: “God has given them a spirit of dullness, eyes so that they
should not see, and ears so that they should not hear, to this very day.” 9 Then David
says,
“Let their table become a net and a trap,
a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
10 Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see,
and bend their backs continually.”
* 11:6 Some old copies read, But if it is by works, then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more work .Romans 11:11
1183
Romans 12:2
11 I say then, “Did they stumble so as to fall?”
May it never be. Instead, by their
failure, salvation has come to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.
12 Now if their failure is the riches of the world, and if their loss is the riches of the
Gentiles, how much greater will their completion be? 13 But now I am speaking to you
Gentiles, and as long as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry.
14 Perhaps I will provoke to jealousy those who are of my own flesh. Perhaps we will
save some of them. 15 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world,
what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 16 If the firstfruits are reserved,
so is the lump of dough. If the root is reserved, so are the branches. 17 But if some
of the branches were broken off, if you, a wild olive branch, were grafted in among
them, and if you shared with them in the rich root of the olive tree, 18 do not boast
over the branches. But if you do boast, it is not you who supports the root, but the
root that supports you. 19 You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might
be grafted in.” 20 That is true. Because of their unbelief they were broken off, but
you stand firm because of your faith. Do not think too highly of yourself, but fear.
21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. 22 Look
at, then, the kind actions and the severity of God: severity came on the Jews who
fell, but God's kindness comes on you, if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you
also will be cut off. 23 And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be
grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again. 24 For if you were cut out of what
is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive
tree, how much more will these Jews, who are the natural branches, be grafted back
into their own olive tree?
25 For I do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, of this mystery, in order that
you will not be wise in your own thinking. This mystery is that a partial hardening
has occurred in Israel, until the completion of the Gentiles come in. 26 Thus all Israel
will be saved, just as it is written:
“Out of Zion will come the Deliverer.
He will remove ungodliness from Jacob,
27 and this will be my covenant with them,
when I will take away their sins.”
28 As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake. But as far as
election is concerned, they are beloved because of their forefathers. 29 For the gifts
and the call of God are unchangeable. 30 For you were formerly disobedient to God,
but now you have received mercy because of their disobedience. 31 In the same way,
now these Jews have been disobedient. The result was that by the mercy shown to
you they may also now receive mercy. 32 For God has shut up all into disobedience,
in order that he might show mercy on all.
33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering!
34 “For who has known the mind of the Lord
or who has become his advisor?
35 Or who has first given anything to God,
that God must repay him?”
36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory
forever. Amen.

1 I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a
living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God. This is your reasonable service. 2 Do not beRomans 12:3
1184
Romans 13:12
conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind. Do this
to know what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.
3 For I say, because of the grace that was given to me, that everyone who is among
you should not think more highly of themselves than they ought to think. Instead,
they should think in a wise way, just as God has given out to each one a certain
amount of faith. 4 For we have many members in one body, but not all the members
have the same function. 5 In the same way, we who are many are one body in Christ,
and are individually members of each other. 6 We have different gifts according to
the grace that was given to us. If one's gift is prophecy, let it be done according to the
proportion of his faith. 7 If one's gift is service, let him serve. If one has the gift of
teaching, let him teach. 8 If one's gift is encouragement, let him encourage. If one's
gift is giving, let him do it generously. If one's gift is leading, let it be done with care.
If one's gift is in showing mercy, let it be done with cheerfulness.
9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; hold on to that which is good.
10 Concerning love of the brothers, be affectionate to one another. Concerning honor,
respect one another. 11 Concerning diligence, do not be hesitant. Concerning the
spirit, be eager. Concerning the Lord, serve him. 12 Rejoice in certain hope, be patient
in suffering, be faithful in prayer. 13 Share in the needs of the saints. Find many
ways to show hospitality. 14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 16 Be of the same mind
toward one another. Do not think in proud ways, but accept lowly people. Do not
be wise in your own thoughts. 17 Repay no one evil for evil. Do good things in the
sight of all people. 18 If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with all
people. 19 Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give way to the wrath of God. For
it is written, “'Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay,' says the Lord.”
20 “But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
If he is thirsty, give him a drink.
For if you do this, you will heap coals of fire on his head.”
21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
13
1 Let every soul be obedient to higher authorities, for there is no authority unless it
comes from God. The authorities that exist have been appointed by God. 2 Therefore
he who resists that authority opposes the command of God; and those who oppose it
will receive judgment on themselves. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good deeds, but
to evil deeds. Do you desire to be unafraid of the one in authority? Do what is good,
and you will receive his approval. 4 For he is a servant of God to you for good. But if
you do what is evil, be afraid; for he does not carry the sword for no reason. For he
is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath on the one who does evil. 5 Therefore you
must obey, not only because of the wrath, but also because of conscience. 6 Because
of this you pay taxes also. For authorities are servants of God, who attend to this very
thing continually. 7 Pay to everyone what is owed to them. Tax to whom tax is due,
toll to whom toll is due; fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.
8 Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves his neighbor
has fulfilled the law. 9 The commandments: “Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do
not steal, do not covet,” and if there is any other commandment also, it is summed
up in this sentence: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” 10 Love does not harm one's
neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.
11 Because of this, you know the time, that it is already time for you to awake out
of sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. 12 The nightRomans 13:13
1185
Romans 15:5
has advanced, and the day has come near. Let us therefore put aside the works of
darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. 13 Let us walk appropriately, as in
the day, not in drunken celebrations or drunkenness; and let us not walk in sexual
immorality or in uncontrolled lust, and not in strife or jealousy. 14 But put on the
Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its lusts.
14
1 Receive anyone who is weak in faith, without giving judgment about arguments.
2 One person has faith to eat anything, another who is weak eats only vegetables.
3 May the one who eats everything not despise the one who does not; and may the
one who does not eat everything not judge the other who eats everything. For God
has accepted him. 4 Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to someone
else? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. But he will be made to stand,
for the Lord is able to make him stand. 5 One person values one day above another.
Another values every day equally. Let each person be convinced in his own mind.
6 He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord; and he who eats, eats for the
Lord, for he gives thanks to God. He who does not eat, refrains from eating for the
Lord, he also gives thanks to God. 7 For none of us lives for himself, and none dies
for himself. 8 For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord.
Then whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. 9 For to this purpose Christ died and
lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and those who are living. 10 But
you, why do you judge your brother? And you, why do you despise your brother?
For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 11 For it is written,
“As I live,” says the Lord, “to me every knee will bend,
and every tongue will give praise to God.”
12 So then, each one of us will give an account of himself to God.
13 Therefore, let us no longer judge one another, but instead decide this, that no one
will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother. 14 I know and am persuaded in
the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean by itself. Only for him who considers anything
to be unclean, for him it is unclean. 15 If because of food your brother is hurt, you
are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food one for whom Christ
died. 16 So do not allow what you consider to be good to be spoken of as evil. 17 For
the kingdom of God is not about food and drink, but about righteousness, peace, and
joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For the one who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to
God and approved by people. 19 So then, let us pursue the things of peace and the
things that build up one another. 20 Do not destroy the work of God because of food.
All things are indeed clean, but it is evil for that person who eats and causes him to
stumble. 21 It is good not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your
brother takes offense. 22 The faith you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed
is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves. 23 He who doubts is
condemned if he eats, because it is not from faith. And whatever is not from faith is
sin.
15
1 Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and ought not
to please ourselves. 2 Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, in
order to build him up. 3 For even Christ did not please himself. Instead, it was just as
it is written, “The insults of those who insulted you fell on me.” 4 For whatever was
previously written was written for our instruction, in order that through patience
and through encouragement of the scriptures we would have certain hope. 5 NowRomans 15:6
1186
Romans 15:31
may the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind
with each other according to Christ Jesus. 6 May he do this in order that with one
mind you may praise with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7 Therefore receive one another, even as Christ also received you, to the praise of
God. 8 For I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision on behalf
of God's truth, in order to confirm the promises given to the fathers, 9 and for the
Gentiles to glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,
“Therefore I will give praise to you among the Gentiles
and sing praise to your name.”
10 Again it says,
“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”
11 And again,
“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles;
let all the peoples praise him.”
12 Again, Isaiah says,
“The root of Jesse will come, the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the
Gentiles will have hope.”
13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace for believing, so that by
the power of the Holy Spirit you will have hope.
14 I myself am also convinced about you, my brothers. I am convinced that also
you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge. I am convinced that
you are also able to exhort one another. 15 But I am writing more boldly to you about
some things in order to remind you again, because of the grace given me by God.
16 This gift was that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus sent to the Gentiles, to offer
as a priest the gospel of God. I should do this so that the offering of the Gentiles might
become acceptable, consecrated by the Holy Spirit. 17 In Christ Jesus I have reason
to boast of my service for God. 18 For I will not dare to speak of anything except
what Christ has accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles. These
are things done by word and action, 19 by the power of signs and wonders, and by
the power of the Holy Spirit. This was so that from Jerusalem, and round about as
far as Illyricum, I might fully carry out the gospel of Christ. 20 In this way, my desire
has been to proclaim the gospel, but not where Christ is known by name, in order
that I might not build upon another man's foundation. 21 It is as it is written:
“Those to whom no tidings of him came will see him,
and those who have not heard will understand.”
22 Therefore I was also hindered many times from coming to you. 23 But now, I no
longer have any place in these regions, and I have been longing for many years to
come to you. 24 I am hopeful that I will see you in passing when I go to Spain, and
to be helped by you along my journey there, once I have enjoyed your company for
a while. 25 But now I am going to Jerusalem, bringing aid to the believers. 26 For it
was the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution to
the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem. 27 Yes, it was their good pleasure,
and, indeed, they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual
things, they owe it to them also to serve them in material things. 28 Therefore, when
I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received what was
collected, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. 29 I know that when I come to
you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
30 Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit,
that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me. 31 Pray that I may be
rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for JerusalemRomans 15:32
1187
Romans 16:27
may be acceptable to the believers. 32 Pray that I may come to you in joy through the
will of God, and that I may, together with you, find rest. 33 May the God of peace be
with you all. Amen.
16
1 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is in
Cenchrea, 2 in order that you may receive her in the Lord. Do this in a manner
worthy of the saints, and stand by her in whatever matter she may have need of you.
For she herself as well has become a helper of many, and of myself as well.
3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 4 who for my
life risked their own lives. I give thanks to them, and not only I, but also all the
churches of the Gentiles. 5 Greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus
my beloved, who is the firstfruit of Asia to Christ. 6 Greet Mary, who has worked
hard for you. 7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners.
They are prominent among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 8 Greet
Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. 9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and
Stachys, my beloved. 10 Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are
of the household of Aristobulus. 11 Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the
household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. 12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who
work hard in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked much in the Lord.
13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 14 Greet Asyncritus,
Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them. 15 Greet
Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the believers who
are with them. 16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet
you.
17 Now I urge you, brothers, to think about those who are causing the divisions
and stumbling. They are going beyond the teaching that you have learned. Turn
away from them. 18 For people such as these do not serve our Lord Christ, but their
own stomach. By their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the
innocent. 19 For your example of obedience reaches everyone. I rejoice, therefore,
over you, but I want you to be wise as to that which is good, and innocent to that
which is evil. 20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my
kinsmen. 22 I, Tertius, who write this epistle down, greet you in the Lord. 23 Gaius,
the host for me and for the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the
city, greets you, with Quartus the brother. 24 *
25 Now to him who is able to make you stand according to my gospel and the preaching
of Jesus Christ,
according to the revelation of the mystery that had been kept secret for long ages,
26 but now has been revealed and made known through the prophetic writings to all
nations, by the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of
faith.
27 To the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever. Amen.

be with you all. Amen .1 Corinthians 1:1
1188
1 Corinthians 1:31
First Corinthians
1 Paul, called by Christ Jesus to be an apostle by the will of God, and Sosthenes our
brother, 2 to the church of God at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ
Jesus, who are called to be holy people. We are also writing to all who call on the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours. 3 May grace and
peace be to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4 I always give thanks to my God for you because of the grace of God that Christ
Jesus gave to you. 5 He has made you rich in every way, in all speech and with all
knowledge, 6 just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed as true among
you. 7 Therefore you lack no spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of
our Lord Jesus Christ. 8 He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be
blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 God is faithful, who called you into
the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
10 Now I urge you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
agree, and that there be no divisions among you. I urge that you be joined together
with the same mind and by the same purpose. 11 For it has been made clear to me, my
brothers, by Chloe's people that there are factions among you. 12 I mean this: Each
one of you says, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” or “I am with Cephas,”
or “I am with Christ.” 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you
baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, except
Crispus and Gaius. 15 This was so that no one would say that you were baptized into
my name. 16 (I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know
if I baptized any others.) 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the
gospel. He did not send me to preach with words of human wisdom, so that the cross
of Christ should not be emptied of its power.
18 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are dying. But among
those whom God is saving, it is the power of God. 19 For it is written,
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.
I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent.”
20 Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this
world? Has not God turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness? 21 Since
the world in its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness
of preaching to save those who believe. 22 For Jews ask for miraculous signs and
Greeks seek wisdom. 23 But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and
foolishness to Greeks. 24 But to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks,
we preach Christ as the power and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God
is wiser than people, and the weakness of God is stronger than people.
26 Look at your calling, brothers. Not many of you were wise by human standards.
Not many of you were powerful. Not many of you were of noble birth. 27 But God
chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. God chose what is weak
in the world to shame what is strong. 28 God chose what is low and despised in the
world. He even chose things that are regarded as nothing, to bring to nothing things
that are held as valuable. 29 He did this so that no one would have a reason to boast
before him. 30 Because of what God did, now you are in Christ Jesus, who became for
us wisdom from God. He became our righteousness, holiness, and redemption. 31 As
a result, as scripture says, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”1 Corinthians 2:1
1 When I came to you,
1189
1 Corinthians 3:13
2
brothers, I did not come with eloquence of speech or
wisdom as I proclaimed hidden truths about God. * 2 For I decided to know nothing
when I was among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 3 And I was with
you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my message and my
proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom. Instead, they were with
the demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 so that your faith might not be in the
wisdom of humans, but in the power of God.
6 Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this world, or
of the rulers of this age, who are passing away. 7 Instead, we speak God's wisdom in
hidden truth, the hidden wisdom that God predestined before the ages for our glory.
8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had understood it, they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 But as it is written,
“Things that no eye has seen,
no ear has heard,
no mind has imagined,
the things that God has prepared for those who love him.”
10 These are the things that God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit
searches everything, even the deep things of God. 11 For who knows a person's
thoughts except the spirit of the person in him? So also, no one knows the deep
things of God except the Spirit of God. 12 But we did not receive the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might know the things freely given
to us by God. 13 We speak about these things in words that man's wisdom cannot
teach, but which the Spirit teaches us. The Spirit interprets spiritual words with
spiritual wisdom. 14 The unspiritual person does not receive the things that belong
to the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. He cannot know them because
they are spiritually discerned. 15 The one who is spiritual judges all things, but he is
not subject to the judgment of others.
16 “For who can know the mind of the Lord, that he can instruct him?”
But we have the mind of Christ.
3
1 And I, brothers, could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as to fleshly
people, as to little children in Christ. 2 I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were
not ready for it; and even now you are not yet ready. 3 For you are still fleshly. For
where jealousy and strife exist among you, are you not living according to the flesh,
and are you not walking by human standards? 4 For when one says, “I follow Paul,”
and another says, “I follow Apollos,” are you not living as human beings? 5 Who then
is Apollos? Who is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, to each of whom the
Lord gave tasks. 6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. 7 So then,
neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything. But it is God who gives the
growth. 8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his
own wages according to his own labor. 9 For we are God's fellow workers. You are
God's garden, God's building.
10 According to the grace of God that was given to me as a skilled master builder,
I laid a foundation and another is building on it. But let each man be careful how
he builds on it. 11 For no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been
laid, that is, Jesus Christ. 12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, 13 his work will be revealed, for the daylight
* 2:1 Many other versions read, as I proclaimed the testimony about God .1 Corinthians 3:14
1190
1 Corinthians 4:18
will reveal it. For it will be revealed in fire. The fire will test the quality of what
each one had done. 14 If anyone's work remains, he will receive a reward; 15 but
if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, as
though escaping through fire.
16 Do you not know that you are God's temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?
17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person. For God's temple is
holy, and so are you.
18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age,
let him become a “fool” that he may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. For it is written,
“He catches the wise in their craftiness.”
20 And again,
“The Lord knows that the reasoning of the wise is futile.”
21 For this reason, let no one boast in men. All things are yours, 22 whether Paul, or
Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come.
All things are yours, 23 and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
4
1 This is how a person should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the
hidden truths of God. 2 Now what is required of stewards is that they are found to
be trustworthy. 3 But for me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you
or by any human court. For I do not even judge myself. 4 I am not aware of any
charge being made against me, but that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord
who judges me. 5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment about anything before the
time, before the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and
reveal the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his praise from God.
6 Now, brothers, I applied these principles to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so
that from us you might learn the meaning of the saying,
“Do not go beyond what is written.”
This is so that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against the other. 7 For
who sees any difference between you and others? What do you have that you did
not freely receive? If you have freely received it, why do you boast as if you had
not done so? 8 Already you have all you could want! Already you have become rich!
You began to reign—and that quite apart from us! Indeed, I wish you did reign, so
that we could reign with you. 9 For I think God has put us apostles on display as
the last in line in a procession and like men sentenced to death. We have become a
spectacle to the world—to angels, and to human beings. 10 We are fools for Christ's
sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in
honor, but we are held in dishonor. 11 Up to this present hour we are hungry and
thirsty, we are poorly clothed, we are brutally beaten, and we are homeless. 12 We
work hard, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless. When we
are persecuted, we endure. 13 When we are slandered, we speak with kindness. We
have become, and are still considered to be, the refuse of the world and the filthiest
of all things.
14 I do not write these things to shame you, but to correct you as my beloved
children. 15 For even if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have
many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 16 So I
urge you to be imitators of me. 17 That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and
faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach
them everywhere and in every church. 18 Now some of you have become arrogant,1 Corinthians 4:19
1191
1 Corinthians 6:11
acting as though I were not coming to you. 19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord
wills. Then I will know not merely the talk of these who are so arrogant, but I will
see their power. 20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.
21 What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and in a spirit of
gentleness?
5
1 We heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality
that is not even permitted among the Gentiles. The report is that one of you is sleeping
with his father's wife. 2 You are so arrogant! Should you not mourn instead? The
one who did this must be removed from among you. 3 For even though I am absent
in body, I am present in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the one who did
this, just as though I were there. 4 When you are assembled in the name of our Lord
Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, 5 hand
this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved
on the day of the Lord. 6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little
yeast leavens the whole loaf? 7 Cleanse yourselves of the old yeast so that you may
be new dough, so that you may be unleavened bread. For Christ, our Passover lamb,
has been sacrificed. 8 So let us then celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the
yeast of bad behavior and wickedness. Instead, let us celebrate with the unleavened
bread of sincerity and truth.
9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. 10 In
no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or
idolaters, since to stay away from them you would need to go out of the world. 11 But
now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother but
who is living in sexual immorality, or who is greedy, or is an idolater, or is verbally
abusive, or is a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat a meal with such a person.
12 For how am I involved with judging those who are outside the church? Instead,
are you not to judge those who are inside the church? 13 But God judges those who
are on the outside.
“Remove the evil person from among you.”
6
1 When one of you has a dispute with another, does he dare to go to the civil court
before an unbelieving judge, rather than before the saints? 2 Do you not know that
the believers will judge the world? If then, you will judge the world, are you not
able to settle matters of little importance? 3 Do you not know that we will judge the
angels? How much more, then, can we judge matters of this life? 4 If then you have to
make judgments that pertain to daily life, why do you lay such cases as these before
those who have no standing in the church? 5 I say this to your shame. Is there no
one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between brothers? 6 But as it stands,
one believer goes to court against another believer, and that case is placed before
a judge who is an unbeliever! 7 The fact that there are any disputes at all between
Christians is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not
rather allow yourselves to be cheated? 8 But you have wronged and cheated others,
and these are your own brothers! 9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not
inherit the kingdom of God? Do not believe lies. The sexually immoral, idolaters,
adulterers, male prostitutes, those who practice homosexuality, 10 thieves, the greedy,
drunkards, slanderers, and swindlers—none of them will inherit the kingdom of God.
11 That is what some of you were like. But you have been cleansed, you have been1 Corinthians 6:12
1192
1 Corinthians 7:18
sanctified, you have been made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
and by the Spirit of our God.
12 “Everything is lawful for me,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is
lawful for me,” but I will not be mastered by any of them. 13 “Food is for the stomach,
and the stomach is for food,” but God will do away with both of them. The body is
not intended for sexual immorality. Instead, the body is for the Lord, and the Lord
will provide for the body. 14 God both raised the Lord and will also raise us up by
his power. 15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then
take away the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute? May it not be! 16 Do
you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her? As
scripture says, “The two will become one flesh.” 17 But he who is joined to the Lord
becomes one spirit with him. 18 Run away from sexual immorality! Every other
sin that a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins
against his own body. 19 Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit, who lives within you, whom you have from God? Do you not know that you
are not your own? 20 For you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God with
your body. *

1 Now concerning the issues you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to touch a
woman.” 2 But because of temptations for many immoral acts, each man should have
his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. 3 The husband should
give to the wife her sexual rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 It is not the
wife who has authority over her own body, it is the husband. Likewise, the husband
does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive each
other, except by mutual agreement and for a specific period of time. Do this so that
you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again, so that
Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
6 But I say these things to you as a concession and not as a command. 7 I wish that
everyone were as I am. But each one has his own gift from God. One has this kind
of gift, and another that kind. 8 To the unmarried and to widows I say that it is good
for them if they remain unmarried, as I am. 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control,
they should marry. For it is better for them to marry than to burn with passion.
10 Now to the married I give this command—not I, but the Lord—the wife should not
separate from her husband 11 (but if she does separate from her husband, she should
remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not
divorce his wife. 12 But to the rest I say—I, not the Lord—that if any brother has a
wife who is an unbeliever, and if she is content to live with him, he should not divorce
her. 13 If a woman has an unbelieving husband, and if he is content to live with her,
she should not divorce him. 14 For the unbelieving husband is set apart because of
his wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart because of the brother. Otherwise your
children would be unclean, but actually they are set apart. 15 But if the unbelieving
partner departs, let him go. In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their
vows. God has called us to live in peace. 16 For how do you know, woman, whether
you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your
wife? 17 Only let each one live the life the Lord has assigned him, each as God has
called him. This is my rule in all the churches. 18 Was anyone circumcised when
he was called to believe? He should not try to appear uncircumcised. Was anyone
* 6:20 Some older copies read, Therefore glorify God with your body and in your spirit, which belong to God .
But the best copies do not have this reading.1 Corinthians 7:19
1193
1 Corinthians 8:6
uncircumcised when he was called to faith? He should not be circumcised. 19 For it is
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision that matters. What matters is obeying the
commandments of God. 20 Each one should remain in the calling he was in when God
called him to believe. 21 Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned
about it. But if you can become free, take advantage of it. 22 For someone who is
called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freeman. Likewise, the one who was free
when he was called to believe is Christ's slave. 23 You have been bought with a price,
so do not become slaves of men. 24 Brothers, in whatever life each of us was in when
we were called to believe, let us remain like that.
25 Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the
Lord. But I give my opinion as one who, by the Lord's mercy, is trustworthy.
26 Therefore, I think that because of the disaster that is coming, it is good for a man
to remain as he is. 27 Are you married to a wife? Do not seek a divorce. If you are
unmarried, do not seek a wife. 28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if an
unmarried woman marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will have many
kinds of worldly trouble, and I want to spare you from this. 29 But this I say, brothers:
The time is short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had
none. 30 Those who weep should act as though they were not weeping, and those
who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did
not possess anything, 31 and those who use the world should not act as though they
are using it to the full. For the world in its present form is coming to an end. 32 I
would like you to be free from worries. The unmarried man is concerned about the
things of the Lord, how to please him. 33 But the married man is concerned about the
things of the world, how to please his wife— 34 he is divided. The unmarried woman
or the virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to be set apart in body
and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the things of the world,
how to please her husband. 35 I say this for your own benefit, and not to put any
constraint on you. I say this for what is right, so that you may be devoted to the Lord
without any distraction. 36 But if anyone thinks that he is not treating his fiancée with
respect—if she is beyond the age of marriage and it must be so—he should do what
he wants. He is not sinning. They should marry. 37 But if he is standing firm in his
heart, if he is not under pressure but can control his own will, and if he has decided
in his own heart to do this, to keep his own fiancée a virgin, he will do well. 38 So the
one who marries his fiancée does well, and the one who chooses not to marry will do
even better. 39 A woman is bound to her husband for as long as he lives. But if her
husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes to marry, but only in the
Lord. 40 Yet in my judgment she would be happier if she lives as she is. And I think
that I also have the Spirit of God.

about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge.
Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 2 If anyone thinks he knows something,
that person does not yet know as he should know. 3 But if anyone loves God, that
person is known by him. 4 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know
that an idol in this world is nothing and that there is no God but one. 5 For maybe
so-called gods do exist, either in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods”
and many “lords.” 6 Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom are all
things and for whom we live, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things
exist, and through whom we exist.1 Corinthians 8:7
1194
1 Corinthians 9:23
7 However, this knowledge is not in everyone.
Instead, some previously practiced
idol worship, and they eat this food as if it were something sacrificed to an idol. Their
conscience is thereby corrupted because it is weak. 8 But food will not present us to
God. We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it. 9 But take care
that your freedom does not become a reason for someone who is weak in faith to
stumble. 10 For suppose that someone sees you, who have knowledge, eating a meal
in an idol's temple. Is not his weak conscience emboldened to eat what is offered to
idols? 11 So because of your understanding about the true nature of idols, the weaker
one, the brother for whom Christ died, is destroyed. 12 Thus, when you sin against
your brothers and wound their weak consciences, you sin against Christ. 13 Therefore,
if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not
cause my brother to fall.

1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not
my workmanship in the Lord? 2 If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you.
For you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord. 3 This is my defense to those
who examine me: 4 Do we not have the right to eat and drink? 5 Do we not have
the right to take along with us a wife who is a believer, as do the rest of the apostles,
and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? 6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who must
work? 7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and
does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink milk from it? 8 Do
I say these things based on human authority? Does not the law also say this? 9 For
it is written in the law of Moses, “Do not put a muzzle on an ox when it is treading
out the grain.” Is it really the oxen that God cares about? 10 Is he not speaking about
us? It was written for us, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the
one who threshes should thresh in the expectation of sharing in the harvest. 11 If we
sowed spiritual things among you, is it too much for us to reap material things from
you? 12 If others exercised this right from you, do we not have even more? But we
did not claim this right. Instead we endured everything rather than be a hindrance
to the gospel of Christ. 13 Do you not know that those who serve in the temple get
their food from the temple? Do you not know that those who serve at the altar share
in what is offered on the altar? 14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those
who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel. 15 But I have not
claimed any of these rights. And I do not write this so something might be done for
me. I would rather die than anyone deprive me of this boast. 16 For if I preach the
gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I must do this. And woe be to me if
I do not preach the gospel! 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if not
willingly, I still have a responsibility that was entrusted to me. 18 What then is my
reward? That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge and so not take
full use of my right in the gospel. 19 For though I am free from all, I became a servant
to all, in order that I might win more. 20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, in order to
win Jews. To those under the law, I became like one under the law in order to win
those under the law. I did this even though I myself was not under the law. * 21 To
those outside the law, I became like one outside the law, although I was not outside
the law of God myself, but under the law of Christ. I did this so that I may win those
outside the law. 22 To the weak I became weak, so that I may win the weak. I have
become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some. 23 I do all things
* 9:20 The ULB and UDB read, I did this even though I was not under the law myself . Some older versions leave
this passage out.1 Corinthians 9:24
1195
1 Corinthians 10:29
for the gospel's sake, so that I may participate in its blessings. 24 Do you not know
that in a race all the runners run the race, but that only one receives the prize? So
run to win the prize. 25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to
receive a wreath that is perishable, but we do it to receive one that is imperishable.
26 Therefore I do not run without purpose or box by beating the air. 27 But I subdue
my body and make it a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself may
not be disqualified.
10
1 I do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, that our fathers were all under the
cloud and all passed through the sea. 2 All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and
in the sea, 3 and all ate the same spiritual food. 4 All drank the same spiritual drink.
For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
5 But God was not well pleased with most of them, and their corpses were scattered
about in the wilderness. 6 Now these things were examples for us, so we would not
long for evil things as they did. 7 Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. This is
as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” 8 Let
us not commit sexual immorality, as many of them did. In one day, twenty-three
thousand people died because of it. 9 Neither let us put Christ to the test, as many of
them did and were destroyed by snakes. 10 Also do not grumble, as many of them did
and were destroyed by an angel of death. 11 Now these things happened to them as
examples for us. They were written for our instruction—for us on whom the end of
the ages has come. 12 Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands be careful that he
does not fall. 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to all humanity.
Instead, God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. With the
temptation he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may be able to endure
it.
14 Therefore, my loved ones, run away from idolatry. 15 I speak to you as people
who have understanding, so you may judge what I say. 16 The cup of blessing that
we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not
a sharing in the body of Christ? 17 Because there is one loaf of bread, we who are
many are one body. We all take of one loaf of bread together. 18 Look at the people
of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? 19 What am I
saying then? That an idol is anything? Or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything?
20 But I say about the things the Gentile pagans sacrifice, that they offer these things
to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons! 21 You
cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot have fellowship
at the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to
jealousy? Are we stronger than he is?
23 “Everything is lawful,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is lawful,”
but not everything builds people up. 24 No one should seek his own good. Instead,
each one should seek the good of his neighbor. 25 You may eat whatever is sold in
the market, without questions of conscience. 26 For “the earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness of it.” 27 If an unbeliever invites you to eat a meal, and you wish to go, eat
whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience. 28 But if someone
says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake
of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience— * 29 the conscience
of the other man, I mean, and not yours. For why should my freedom be judged
* 10:28 Some older copies add, For the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord . But the best copies do not
have this.1 Corinthians 10:30
1196
1 Corinthians 10:32
by another's conscience? 30 If I partake of the meal with gratitude, why am I being
insulted for that for which I gave thanks? 31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or
whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. 32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks,
or to the church of God. 33 I try to please all people in all things. I do not seek my
benefit, but that of the many. I do this so that they may be saved.
11
1 Be imitators of me, just as I am an imitator of Christ.
2 Now I praise you because you remember me in everything. I praise you because
you hold fast to the traditions just as I delivered them to you. 3 Now I want you to
understand that Christ is the head of every man, that a man is the head of a woman,
and that God is the head of Christ. 4 Any man who prays or prophesies with his
head covered dishonors his head. 5 But any woman who prays or prophesies with
her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is the same thing as if her head were
shaved. 6 For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut her hair short. If it is
disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or for her to shave her head, let her
cover her head. 7 For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image
and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man. 8 For man was not made
from woman. Instead, woman was made from man. 9 For neither was man created
for woman. Instead, woman was created for man. 10 This is why the woman ought
to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. 11 Nevertheless, in
the Lord, the woman is not independent from the man, nor is the man independent
from the woman. 12 For as the woman comes from the man, so does the man come
from the woman. And all things come from God. 13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper
for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14 Does not even nature itself
teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him? 15 Does not nature
teach you that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair has been given
to her as a covering. 16 But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any
other practice, nor do the churches of God.
17 But in the following instructions, I do not praise you. For when you come together,
it is not for the better but for the worse. 18 For in the first place, I hear that when you
come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
19 For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may
be recognized among you. 20 For when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper
that you eat. 21 When you eat, each one eats his own food before the others have
their meal. One is hungry, and another becomes drunk. 22 Do you not have houses
to eat and to drink in? Do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who
have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you
for this! 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord
Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed, took bread. 24 After he had given thanks,
he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this to remember me.”
25 In the same way he took the cup after supper, and he said, “This cup is the new
covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it, to remember me.” 26 For
every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until
he comes. 27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an
unworthy manner, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 28 Let a person
examine himself first, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
29 For he who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment
to himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and ill, and some of you have
fallen asleep. 31 But if we examine ourselves, we will not be judged. 32 But when1 Corinthians 10:33
1197
1 Corinthians 12:31
we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined, so that we may not be condemned
along with the world. 33 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait
for one another. 34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come
together it will not be for judgment. And about the other things you wrote, I will give
directions when I come.
12
1 About spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know
that when you were pagans, you were led astray to idols who could not speak, in
whatever ways you were led by them. 3 Therefore I want you to know that no one
who speaks by the Spirit of God can say, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus
is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
4 Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 There are different ministries,
but the same Lord; 6 and there are different kinds of work, but it is the same God who
makes them possible in everyone. 7 Now to each one is given the outward display of
the Spirit for the benefit of all. 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom,
and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit. 9 To another is given faith
by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit. 10 To another
is given deeds of power, and to another prophecy. To another is given the ability to
distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the
interpretation of tongues. 11 All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, giving
the gifts to each one individually, as he chooses.
12 For as the body is one and has many members and all are members of the same
body, so it is with Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
whether Jews or Greeks, whether bound or free, and all were made to drink of one
Spirit. 14 For the body is not a single member, but many. 15 If the foot says, “Since
I am not the hand, I am not part of the body,” it is not any less a part of the body.
16 And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it is not
any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense
of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
18 But God arranged each part of the body as he designed it. 19 If they were all the
same member, where would the body be? 20 So now they are many members, but
only one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you.” Nor does
the head say to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 But the members of the body that
appear to be weaker are essential, 23 and the parts of the body that we think are less
honorable, we give them greater honor, and our unpresentable members have more
dignity. 24 Now our presentable members have no need to be treated with dignity,
for they already have dignity. But God has joined all the members together, and he
gave more honor to those that lacked it. 25 He did this so there may be no division
within the body, but that the members should care for one another with the same
affection. 26 So when one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or when
one member is honored, all the members rejoice together. 27 Now you are the body of
Christ and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church first
apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those who do powerful deeds, then
gifts of healing, those who provide helps, those who do the work of administration,
and those who have various kinds of tongues. 29 Are all of them apostles? Are all
prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do powerful deeds? 30 Do all of them have gifts
of healing? Do all of them speak with tongues? Do all of them interpret tongues?
31 Zealously seek the greater gifts. But I will show you a more excellent way.1 Corinthians 13:1
1198
1 Corinthians 14:19
13
1 Suppose that I speak with the tongues of men and of angels. But if I do not have
love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 Suppose that I have the
gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and knowledge, and that I have all
faith so as to remove mountains. But if I do not have love, I am nothing. 3 Suppose
that I give all I own to feed the poor, and that I give my body to be burned. But if I
do not have love, I gain nothing. * 4 Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or
boast. It is not arrogant 5 or rude. It is not self-serving. It is not easily angered, nor
does it keep a count of wrongs. 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness. Instead, it
rejoices in the truth. 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and
endures all things. 8 Love never ends. If there are prophecies, they will pass away. If
there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we
know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when the perfect comes, that which is
incomplete will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like
a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I put away childish things.
12 For now we see indirectly in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part,
but then I will know fully just as I have been fully known. 13 But now these three
remain: faith, future confidence, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
14
1 Pursue love and be zealous for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. For
no one understands him because he speaks hidden things in the Spirit. 3 But the
one who prophesies speaks to people to build them up, to encourage them, and to
comfort them. 4 The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who
prophesies builds up the church. 5 Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues. But even
more than that, I wish that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater
than the one who speaks in tongues (unless someone interprets so that the church
may be built up). 6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how
will I benefit you? I cannot, unless I speak to you with revelation, or knowledge, or
prophecy, or teaching. 7 If lifeless instruments are producing sounds—like the flute or
the harp—and they do not produce different tones, how will anyone know what tune
the flute or harp is playing? 8 For if the trumpet is played with an uncertain sound,
how will anyone know when it is time to prepare for battle? 9 So it is with you. If
you utter speech that is unintelligible, how will anyone understand what you have
said? You will be speaking, and no one will understand you. 10 There are doubtless
many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning. 11 But if I do
not know the meaning of a language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the
speaker will be a foreigner to me. 12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for the
manifestations of the Spirit, try to excel in the gifts that build up the church. 13 So
the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I pray
in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 15 What am I to do? I will
pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, and
I will also sing with my mind. 16 Otherwise, if you praise God with the spirit, how
will the outsider say “Amen” when you are giving thanks if he does not know what
you are saying? 17 For you certainly give thanks well enough, but the other person
is not built up. 18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19 But in
* 13:3 The ULB and UDB, together with most versions, read, I give my body to be burned . Some older versions
read, I give my body so that I might boast .1 Corinthians 14:20
1199
1 Corinthians 15:8
the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so that I might
instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
20 Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Rather, in regard to evil, be like
infants. But in your thinking be mature. 21 In the law it is written,
“By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers
I will speak to this people.
Even then they will not hear me,”
says the Lord. 22 So then, tongues are a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But
prophesying is for a sign, not for unbelievers, but for believers. 23 If, therefore, the
whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders and unbelievers
come in, would they not say that you are insane? 24 But if you all were prophesying
and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears. He
would be judged by all that is said. 25 The secrets of his heart would be revealed. As
a result, he would fall on his face and worship God. He would declare that God is
really among you.
26 What is next then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a
teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Do everything so that you build
up the church. 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, and
each one in turn, then someone should interpret what is said. 28 But if there is no
one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in the church. Let each one speak to
himself alone and to God. 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others listen
with discernment to what is said. 30 But if an insight is given to one who is sitting
in the service, let the one who had been speaking be silent. 31 For each of you can
prophesy one by one so that each one may learn and all may be encouraged. 32 For
the spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets. 33 For God is not a
God of confusion, but of peace.
This is the rule in all the churches of the saints. 34 The women should keep silent
in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak. Instead, they should be in
submission, as also the law says. 35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them
ask their husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
36 Did the word of God come from you? Are you the only ones it has reached?
37 If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, he should acknowledge
that the things I write to you are a command of the Lord. 38 But if anyone does not
recognize this, let him not be recognized. *
39 So then, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid anyone from
speaking in tongues. 40 But let all things be done properly and in order.
15
1 Now I remind you, brothers, of the gospel I proclaimed to you, which you received
and on which you stand. 2 It is by this gospel that you are being saved, if you hold
firmly to the word I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. 3 For I delivered to
you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according
to the scriptures, 4 that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day
according to the scriptures. 5 Christ appeared to Cephas, and then to the twelve;
6 then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once. Most of them are
still alive, but some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the
apostles. 8 Last of all, he appeared to me, as if to a child born at the wrong time.
* 14:38 Most versions, including the ULB and UDB, read, But if anyone does not recognize this, let him not be
recognized . Some older versions read, But if anyone is ignorant of this, let him be ignorant .1 Corinthians 15:9
1200
1 Corinthians 15:47
9 For I am the least of the apostles. I am unworthy to be called an apostle because
I persecuted the church of God. 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his
grace in me was not in vain. Instead, I worked harder than all of them. Yet it was
not I, but the grace of God that is with me. 11 Therefore whether it is I or they, so we
preach and so you believed.
12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say
there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead,
then not even Christ has been raised; 14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our
preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain. 15 Also, we are found to be false
witnesses about God, because we testified against God, saying he raised up Christ
when he did not. 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;
17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is in vain and you are still in your sins.
18 Then those who have died in Christ have also perished. 19 If only in this life we
have hope in Christ, of all people we are most to be pitied.
20 But now Christ, who is the firstfruits of those who died, has been raised from the
dead. 21 For since death came by a man, by a man also came the resurrection of the
dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. 23 But each in
his own order: Christ, who is the firstfruits, and then those who belong to Christ will
be made alive at his coming. 24 Then will be the end, when Christ will hand over the
kingdom to God the Father. This is when he will abolish all rule and all authority and
power. 25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 26 The
last enemy to be destroyed is death. 27 For “he has put everything under his feet.”
But when it says “he has put everything,” it is clear that this does not include the
one who put everything in subjection to himself. 28 When all things are subjected to
him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who put all things into subjection
under him, that God may be all in all.
29 Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not
raised at all, why are they baptized for them? 30 Why then, are we in danger every
hour? 31 Every day I face death! This is as sure as my boasting in you, which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord. 32 What do I gain, from a human point of view, if I fought with
beasts at Ephesus, if the dead are not raised? “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
we die.” 33 Be not deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.” 34 Sober up! Live
righteously! Do not keep sinning. For some of you have no knowledge of God. I say
this to your shame.
35 But someone will say, “How are the dead raised, and with what kind of body will
they come?” 36 You are so ignorant! What you sow will not start to grow unless it dies.
37 What you sow is not the body that will be, but a bare seed. It may become wheat or
something else. 38 But God will give it a body as he chooses, and to each seed its own
body. 39 Not all flesh is the same. Instead, there is one flesh of human beings, and
another flesh for animals, and another flesh for birds, and another for fish. 40 There
are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly body is
one kind and the glory of the earthly is another. 41 There is one glory of the sun,
and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For one star differs
from another star in glory. 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is
perishable, and what is raised is imperishable. 43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised
in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body;
it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
45 So also it is written, “The first man Adam became a living soul.” The last Adam
became a life-giving spirit. 46 But the spiritual did not come first but the natural, and
then the spiritual. 47 The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is1 Corinthians 15:48
1201
1 Corinthians 16:20
from heaven. 48 Just as the one made from dust is, so also are those who are made of
the dust, and as the man of heaven is, so also are those who are of heaven. 49 Just as
we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man
of heaven.
50 Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
Neither does what is perishable inherit what is imperishable. 51 Look! I tell you a
secret truth: We will not all die, but we will all be changed. 52 We will be changed
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will
sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For this
perishable body must put on what is imperishable, and this mortal body must put on
immortality. 54 But when this perishable body has put on what is imperishable, and
when this mortal body has put on immortality, then will come about the saying that
is written,
“Death is swallowed up in victory.”
55 “Death, where is your victory?
Death, where is your sting?”
56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God, who
gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! 58 Therefore, my dear brothers,
be steadfast and immovable. Always abound in the work of the Lord, because you
know that your work in the Lord is not in vain.
16
1 Now concerning the collection for the believers, as I directed the churches of
Galatia, so you are to do. 2 On the first day of the week, each of you is to put something
aside and store it up as you are able. Do this so that there will be no collections when
I come. 3 When I arrive, whomever you approve, I will send with letters to deliver
your offering to Jerusalem. 4 If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with
me. 5 But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia. For I will pass through
Macedonia. 6 Perhaps I may stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may
help me on my journey, wherever I go. 7 For I do not wish to see you now for only a
passing visit. For I am looking forward to spending more time with you, if the Lord
permits. 8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 9 for a wide door has opened for
me, and there are many adversaries.
10 Now when Timothy comes, see that he is with you unafraid, for he is doing the
work of the Lord, as I am doing. 11 Let no one despise him. Help him on his way in
peace, so that he may come to me. For I am expecting him to come along with the
brothers. 12 Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly encouraged him to visit
you with the brothers. But it was not at all his will that he come now. However, he
will come when the time is right.
13 Be watchful, stand fast in the faith, act like men, be strong. 14 Let all that you do
be done in love.
15 You know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first converts in Achaia,
and that they have set themselves to the service of the believers. Now I urge you,
brothers, 16 to be in submission to such people and to everyone who helps in the work
and labors with us. 17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus.
They have made up for your absence. 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours.
So then, recognize people like this.
19 The churches of Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the
Lord, with the church that is in their home. 20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one
another with a holy kiss.1 Corinthians 16:21
1202
1 Corinthians 16:24
21 I, Paul, write this with my own hand. 22 If anyone does not love the Lord, may
he be accursed. Our Lord, come! 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 24 My
love be with you all in Christ Jesus. *
* 16:24 Some older versions add, Amen . But many newer versions, including the ULB and UDB, leave it out.2 Corinthians 1:1
1203
2 Corinthians 2:3
Second Corinthians
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to
the church of God that is in Corinth, and to all the believers in the entire region of
Achaia. 2 May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
3 May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be praised. He is the Father of
mercies and the God of all comfort. 4 God comforts us in all our affliction, so that
we can comfort those who are in any affliction. We comfort others with the same
comfort that God used to comfort us. 5 For just as the sufferings of Christ abound for
our sake, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. 6 But if we are afflicted, it is
for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort. Your
comfort is working effectively when you patiently share in the same sufferings that
we also suffer. 7 Our expectation concerning you is unshaken, for we know that as
you share the sufferings, you also share our comfort. 8 For we do not want you to
be uninformed, brothers, about the troubles we had in Asia. We were so completely
crushed beyond our strength that we despaired even of life. 9 Indeed, we had the
sentence of death on us. But that was to make us not put our trust in ourselves, but
instead in God, who raises the dead. 10 He rescued us from such a deadly peril, and
he will rescue us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver
us. 11 He will do this as you also help us by your prayer. Then many will give thanks
on our behalf for the gracious favor given to us through the prayers of many.
12 We are proud of this: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves
in the world with holiness and godly sincerity, not relying on fleshly wisdom but on
the grace of God. 13 We write to you nothing that you cannot read and understand. I
expect that, 14 as you have understood us in part, we will be your reason for boasting
on the day of our Lord Jesus, just as you will be our reason to boast.
15 Because I was confident about this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you
might receive the benefit of two visits. 16 I was planning to visit you on my way to
Macedonia. Then I wanted to visit you again on my trip from Macedonia, and then
for you to send me on my way to Judea. 17 When I was thinking this way, was I
hesitating? Do I plan things according to human standards, so that I say “Yes, yes”
and “No, no” at the same time? 18 But just as God is faithful, we do not say both
“Yes” and “No.” 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom Silvanus, Timothy and I
proclaimed among you, is not “Yes” and “No.” Instead, he is always “Yes.” 20 For all
the promises of God are “Yes” in him. So also through him we say “Amen” to the
glory of God. 21 Now it is God who confirms us with you in Christ, and he appointed
us, 22 he set his seal on us and he gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee of
what is to come.
23 Instead, I call God to bear witness for me that the reason I did not come to Corinth
was so that I might spare you. 24 This is not because we are trying to control what
your faith should be. Instead, we are working with you for your joy, as you stand in
your faith.
2
1 So I decided for my own part that I would not again come to you in painful
circumstances. 2 If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who
was hurt by me? 3 I wrote as I did in order that when I came to you I might not be
hurt by those who should have made me rejoice. I have confidence about all of you2 Corinthians 2:4
1204
2 Corinthians 3:18
that my joy is the same joy you all have. 4 For I wrote to you from great affliction, with
anguish of heart, and with many tears. I did not want to cause you pain. Instead, I
wanted you to know the depth of the love that I have for you.
5 If anyone has caused pain, he has not caused it only to me, but in some measure—
not to put it too harshly—to all of you. 6 This punishment of that person by the
majority is enough. 7 So now rather than punishment, you should forgive and comfort
him. Do this so that he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow. 8 So I encourage you
to publicly affirm your love for him. 9 This was the reason I wrote, so that I might
test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. 10 If you forgive anyone,
I forgive that person as well. What I have forgiven—if I have forgiven anything—it is
forgiven for your sake in the presence of Christ. 11 This is so that Satan will not trick
us. For we are not ignorant of his plans.
12 A door was opened to me by the Lord when I came to the city of Troas to preach
the gospel of Christ there. 13 I had no relief in my spirit, because I did not find my
brother Titus there. So I left them and went on to Macedonia.
14 But may thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph. Through
us he spreads the sweet aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. 15 For we are
to God the sweet aroma of Christ, both among those who are saved and among those
who are perishing. 16 To the people who are perishing, it is an aroma from death
to death. To the ones being saved, it is an aroma from life to life. Who is worthy
of these things? 17 For we are not like so many people who sell the word of God for
profit. Instead, with purity of motives, we speak in Christ, as we are sent from God,
in the sight of God.
1 Are
3
we beginning to praise ourselves again? We do not need letters of
recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we? 2 You yourselves are
our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.
3 You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us. It was written not with
ink but by the Spirit of the living God. It was not written on tablets of stone, but on
tablets of human hearts. 4 And this is the confidence that we have through Christ
before God. 5 We are not competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from
us. Instead, our competence is from God. 6 It is God who made us able to be servants
of a new covenant. This is a covenant not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter
kills, but the Spirit gives life. 7 Now the service that produced death—engraved in
letters on stones—came in such glory that the people of Israel could not look directly
at Moses' face. This is because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading. 8 How
much more glorious will be the service that the Spirit does? 9 For if the service of
condemnation had glory, how much more does the service of righteousness abound
in glory! 10 For indeed, that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious in
this respect, because of the glory that exceeds it. 11 For if that which was passing
away had glory, how much more will what is permanent have glory!
12 Since we have such a hope, we are very bold. 13 We are not like Moses, who
put a veil over his face, so that the people of Israel were not able to look directly at
the ending of a glory that was passing away. 14 But their minds were closed. For to
this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains. It has not been
removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 15 But even today, whenever Moses
is read, a veil covers their hearts. 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is
taken away. 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
freedom. 18 Now all of us, with unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord. We are being2 Corinthians 4:1
1205
2 Corinthians 5:12
transformed into the same glorious likeness from one degree of glory into another,
just as from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
4
1 Therefore, because we have this ministry, and just as we have received mercy, we
do not become discouraged. 2 Instead, we have rejected secret and shameful ways.
We do not live by craftiness, and we do not mishandle the word of God. By presenting
the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. 3 But
if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. 4 In their case, the
god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds. As a result, they are not able
to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 5 For we
do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants
for Jesus' sake. 6 For God is the one who said, “Light will shine out of darkness.” He
has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
presence of Jesus Christ.
7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that it is clear that the exceedingly
great power belongs to God and not to us. 8 We are afflicted in every way, but not
overwhelmed. We are perplexed but not filled with despair. 9 We are persecuted but
not forsaken. We are struck down but not destroyed. 10 We always carry in our body
the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be shown in our bodies. 11 We
who are alive are always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the
life of Jesus may be shown in our body. 12 So death is at work in us, but life is at work
in you. 13 But we have the same spirit of faith according to that which was written:
“I believed, and so I spoke.” We also believe, and so we also speak, 14 because we
know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and bring us
with you into his presence. 15 Everything is for your sake so that, as grace is spread
to many people, thanksgiving may increase to the glory of God.
16 So we do not become discouraged. Even though outwardly we are wasting away,
inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 17 For this momentary, light affliction is
preparing us for an eternal weight of glory that exceeds all measurement. 18 For we
are not watching for things that are seen, but for things that are unseen. The things
that we can see are temporary, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
5
1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a
building from God. It is a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in
heaven. 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling.
3 We long for this because by putting it on we will not be found to be naked. 4 For
indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened. We do not want to be
unclothed. Instead, we want to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed
up by life. 5 The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the
Spirit as a guarantee of what is to come. 6 Therefore always be confident. Be aware
that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord. 7 For we walk
by faith, not by sight. 8 So we have confidence. We would rather be away from the
body and at home with the Lord. 9 So we make it our goal, whether we are at home
or away, to please him. 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
so that each one may receive what is due for the things done in the body, whether
for good or for bad.
11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. What we are is
clearly seen by God. I expect that it is also clear to your conscience. 12 We are not2 Corinthians 5:13
1206
2 Corinthians 6:17
trying to persuade you again to view us as sincere. Instead, we are giving you a reason
to be proud of us, so you may have an answer for those who boast about appearances
but not about what is in the heart. 13 For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; and
if we are in our right minds, it is for your sake. 14 For the love of Christ compels us,
because we are certain of this: That one person died for all, and that therefore all have
died. 15 He died for all, so that those who live should live no longer for themselves
but for him who for their sake died and was raised. 16 For this reason, from now
on we do not judge anyone according to human standards, even though we once
regarded Christ in this way. But now we do not judge anyone in this way any longer.
17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed
away. See, they have become new. 18 All these things are from God. He reconciled us
to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. 19 That is,
in Christ God is reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against
them. He is entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
20 So we are appointed as representatives of Christ, as though God were making his
appeal through us. We plead with you, for the sake of Christ: “Be reconciled to God!”
21 He made Christ become the sacrifice for our sin. He is the one who never sinned.
He did this so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
6
1 Working together with him, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in
vain. 2 For he says,
“In a favorable time I paid attention to you,
and in the day of salvation I helped you.”
Look, now is the favorable time. Look, now is the day of salvation. 3 We do not place a
stumbling block in front of anyone, for we do not wish our ministry to be discredited.
4 Instead, we prove ourselves by all our actions, that we are God's servants. We are his
servants in much endurance, affliction, distress, hardship, 5 beatings, imprisonments,
riots, in hard work, in sleepless nights, in hunger, 6 in purity, knowledge, patience,
kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love. 7 We are his servants in the word of
truth, in the power of God. We have the armor of righteousness for the right hand
and for the left. 8 We work in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are
accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful. 9 We work as if we were unknown
and we are still well known. We work as dying and—see!—we are still living. We
work as being punished for our actions but not as condemned to death. 10 We work
as sorrowful, but we are always rejoicing. We work as poor, but we are making many
rich. We work as having nothing and yet as possessing all things.
11 We have spoken the whole truth to you, Corinthians, and our heart is wide open.
12 You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own hearts. 13 Now
in fair exchange—I speak as to children—open yourselves wide also. 14 Do not be
tied together with unbelievers. For what association does righteousness have with
lawlessness? For what fellowship does light have with darkness? 15 What agreement
can Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have together with an
unbeliever? 16 And what agreement is there between the temple of God and idols?
For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:
“I will dwell among them and walk among them.
I will be their God,
and they will be my people.”
17 Therefore,
“Come out from among them,2 Corinthians 6:18
1207
2 Corinthians 8:6
and be set apart,” says the Lord.
“Touch no unclean thing,
and I will welcome you.
18 I will be a Father to you,
and you will be my sons and daughters,”
says the Lord Almighty.
7
1 Loved ones, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves of everything
that makes us unclean in our body and spirit. Let us pursue holiness in the fear of
God.
2 Make room for us! We have not wronged anyone. We have not harmed anyone
or taken advantage of anyone. 3 It is not to condemn you that I say this. For I have
already said that you are in our hearts, for us to die together and to live together.
4 I have great confidence in you, and I am proud of you. I am filled with comfort. I
overflow with joy even in all our afflictions.
5 When we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest. Instead, we were troubled
in every way by conflicts on the outside and fears on the inside. 6 But God, who
comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus. 7 It was not only by
his arrival that God comforted us. It was also by the comfort that Titus had received
from you. He told us of your great affection, your sorrow, and your deep concern
for me. So I rejoiced even more. 8 Even though my letter made you sad, I do not
regret it. But I did regret it when I saw that my letter made you sad. But you were
sad just for a little while. 9 Now I rejoice, not because you were distressed, but
because your sadness brought you to repentance. You experienced a godly sorrow,
so you suffered no loss because of us. 10 For godly sorrow brings about repentance
that accomplishes salvation without regret. Worldly sorrow, however, brings about
death. 11 See what great determination this godly sorrow produced in you. How
great was the determination in you to prove you were innocent. How great was your
indignation, your fear, your longing, your zeal, and your desire to see that justice
should be done! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this
matter. 12 Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the wrongdoer, nor
for the one who suffered the wrong, but so that your good will toward us should be
made known to you in the sight of God. 13 It is by this that we are encouraged.
In addition to our own comfort, we also rejoiced even more because of Titus' joy,
because his spirit was refreshed by all of you. 14 For if I boasted to him about you,
I was not embarrassed. On the contrary, just as everything we said to you was true,
our boasting about you to Titus proved to be true. 15 His affection for you is even
greater, as he remembers the obedience of all of you, how you welcomed him with
fear and trembling. 16 I rejoice because I have complete confidence in you.
8
1 We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given to the
churches of Macedonia. 2 During a great test of affliction, the abundance of their joy
and the extremity of their poverty have produced great riches of generosity. 3 For I
bear witness that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond what they
were able, and of their own free will, 4 they urgently pleaded with us for the privlege
of sharing in this ministry to the believers. 5 This did not happen as we had expected.
Instead, they first gave themselves to the Lord. Then they gave themselves to us by
the will of God. 6 So we urged Titus, who had already begun this task, to complete2 Corinthians 8:7
1208
2 Corinthians 9:8
among you this act of grace. 7 But you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in
knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us. So also make sure that you excel
in this act of grace. * 8 I say this not as a command. Instead, I say this in order to test
the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the eagerness of other people. 9 For you
know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Even though he was rich, for your sakes he
became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich. 10 In this matter
I will give you advice that will help you. One year ago, you not only started to do
something, but you desired to do it. 11 Now finish it. Just as there was an eagerness
and desire to do it then, may you also bring it to completion, as much as you can.
12 For if you are eager to do this deed, it is a good and acceptable thing. It must be
based on what a person has, not on what he does not have. 13 For this task is not in
order that others may be relieved and you may be burdened. Instead, there should
be fairness. 14 Your abundance at the present time will supply what they need. This is
also so that their abundance may supply your need, and so that there may be fairness.
15 It is as it is written:
“The one with much did not have anything left over,
and the one who had little did not have any lack.”
16 But thanks be to God, who put into Titus' heart the same earnest care that I have
for you. 17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but he was also very earnest about
it. He came to you of his own free will. 18 We have sent with him the brother who is
praised among all of the churches for his work in proclaiming the gospel. 19 Not only
this, but he also was selected by the churches to travel with us in our carrying out this
act of grace. This is for the honor of the Lord himself and for our eagerness to help.
20 We are avoiding the possibility that anyone should complain about us concerning
this generosity that we are carrying out. 21 We take care to do what is honorable, not
only before the Lord, but also before people. 22 We are also sending another brother
with them. We have tested him in many ways and found him diligent for many tasks.
He is even more eager now because of the great confidence he has in you. 23 As for
Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are sent
by the churches. They are an honor to Christ. 24 So show them your love, and show
to the churches the reason for our boasting about you.

1 Concerning the ministry for the believers, it is not necessary for me to write to
you. 2 I know about your desire, which I boasted about to the people of Macedonia.
I told them that Achaia has been getting ready since last year. Your eagerness has
motivated most of them to action. 3 Now I have sent the brothers so that our boasting
about you may not be futile, and so that you would be ready, as I said you would be.
4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we would
be ashamed—I say nothing about you—for being so confident in you. 5 So I thought
it was necessary to urge the brothers to come to you and to make arrangements in
advance for the gift you have promised. This is so that it might be ready as a blessing,
and not as something extorted.
6 The point is this: The one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one
who sows for the purpose of a blessing will also reap a blessing. 7 Let each one give
as he has planned in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a
cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to make all grace overflow for you, so that, always,

read, and in our love for you .2 Corinthians 9:9
1209
2 Corinthians 11:2
in all things, you may have all you need. This will be so that you may multiply every
good deed. 9 It is as it is written:
“He has distributed his riches and given them to the poor.
His righteousness lasts forever.”
10 He who supplies seed to the farmer who sows and bread for food, will also supply
and multiply your seed for sowing. He will increase the harvest of your righteousness.
11 You will be enriched in every way so you can be generous. This will bring about
thanksgiving to God through us. 12 For carrying out this service not only meets the
needs of the saints but is also overflowing into many acts of thanksgiving to God.
13 Because of your being tested and proved by this service, you will also glorify God
by obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ. You will also glorify God by
the generosity of your gift to them and to everyone. 14 They long for you, and they
are praying for you. They do this because of the very great grace of God that is on
you. 15 May thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
10
1 I, Paul, myself appeal to you, by the humility and gentleness of Christ. I am meek
when I am in your presence, but I am bold toward you when I am away. 2 I beg of
you that, when I am present with you, I will not need to be bold with self-confidence.
But I think I will need to be bold when I oppose those who assume that we are living
according to the flesh. 3 For even though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war
according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons we fight with are not fleshly. Instead,
they have divine power to destroy strongholds. They bring to nothing misleading
arguments. 5 We also destroy every high thing that rises up against the knowledge
of God. We take every thought captive into obedience to Christ. 6 And we are getting
ready to punish every act of disobedience, as soon as your obedience is complete.
7 Look at what is clearly in front of you. If anyone is convinced that he is Christ's,
let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we. 8 For even if I boast
a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave for us to build you up
and not to destroy you, I will not be ashamed. 9 I do not want it to appear that I
am terrifying you by my letters. 10 For some people say, “His letters are serious and
powerful, but physically he is weak. His words are not worth listening to.” 11 Let such
people be aware that what we are in the words of our letters when we are absent is
what we will be in our actions when we are there. 12 We do not go so far as to group
ourselves or compare ourselves with those who praise themselves. But when they
measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with each other, they
have no insight. 13 We, however, will not boast beyond limits. Instead, we will do so
only within the limits of what God has assigned to us, limits that reach as far as you.
14 For we did not overextend ourselves when we reached you. We were the first to
reach as far as you with the gospel of Christ. 15 We have not boasted beyond limits
about the labors of others. Instead, we expect that as your faith continues to grow,
our work among you will greatly expand. 16 We hope for this, so that we may preach
the gospel even in regions beyond you. We will not boast about the work being done
in another's area.
17 “But let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
18 For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved. Instead, it is the
one whom the Lord recommends.
11
1 I wish that you could put up with me in some foolishness. But you are indeed
putting up with me! 2 For I am jealous about you. I have a godly jealousy for you,2 Corinthians 11:3
1210
2 Corinthians 11:33
since I promised you in marriage to one husband. I promised to present you as a pure
virgin to Christ. 3 But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his
craftiness, your thoughts might be led astray away from a sincere and pure devotion
to Christ. 4 For suppose that someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one
we preached. Or suppose that you receive a different spirit than what you received.
Or suppose that you receive a different gospel than the one you received. You put up
with these things well enough! 5 For I think that I am not in the least inferior to those
so-called super-apostles. 6 But even if I am untrained in giving speeches, I am not
untrained in knowledge. In every way and in all things we have made this known to
you. 7 Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted? For I freely preached
the gospel of God to you. 8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them
so that I could serve you. 9 When I was with you and I was in need, I did not burden
anyone. For my needs were met by the brothers who came from Macedonia. In
everything I have kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do
that. 10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in
the parts of Achaia. 11 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows. 12 And what I do
I will keep doing, in order that I may take away the claim for criticizing me and the
claim for which they want to boast—that they are found to be doing the same work
that we are doing. 13 For such people are false apostles and deceitful workers. They
disguise themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And this is no surprise, for even Satan
disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 It is no great surprise if his servants also
disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their fate will be what their deeds
deserve.
16 I say again:
Let no one think I am a fool. But if you do, receive me as a fool
so I may boast a little. 17 What I am saying with this boastful confidence—I am not
talking the way the Lord would—I am saying as a fool. 18 Since many people boast
according to the flesh, I will also boast. 19 For you gladly put up with fools. You are
wise yourselves! 20 For you put up with someone if he enslaves you, if he consumes
you, if he takes advantage of you, if he considers himself better than you, or if he
slaps you in the face. 21 I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that. Yet
if anyone boasts—I am speaking like a fool—I too will boast. 22 Are they Hebrews? So
am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 23 Are
they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more. I have
been in even more hard work, in far more prisons, in beatings beyond measure, in
facing many dangers of death. 24 From Jews I received five times the “forty lashes
minus one.” 25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times
I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day on the open sea. 26 I have been
on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, in danger from robbers, in danger from
my own people, in danger from the Gentiles, in danger in the city, in danger in the
wilderness, in danger at sea, in danger from false brothers. 27 I have been at hard
work and in hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often in fasting,
in cold and nakedness. 28 Apart from everything else, there is the daily pressure on
me of my anxiety for all the churches. 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who
has been caused to stumble, and I do not burn? 30 If I must boast, I will boast about
what shows my weaknesses. 31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, the one who is
praised forever, knows that I am not lying!
32 At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus
to arrest me. 33 But I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall, and I
escaped from his hands.2 Corinthians 12:1
1211
2 Corinthians 13:5
12
1 I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations
from the Lord. 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago who—whether in
the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third
heaven. 3 And I know that this man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not
know, God knows— 4 was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred for
anyone to say. 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast. But on behalf of myself I will
not boast, except about my weaknesses. 6 If I should choose to boast, I will not be a
fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no
one will think more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me. 7 To keep me
from boasting because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn in the
flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to afflict me—so I would not become
overly proud. 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from
me. 9 But he said to me, “My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in
weakness.” So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of
Christ might reside on me. 10 Therefore I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses,
in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am
weak, then I am strong.
11 I have become a fool! You forced me to this, for I should have been praised by
you. For I was not at all inferior to the so-called super-apostles, even though I am
nothing. 12 The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with complete
patience, signs and wonders and mighty deeds. 13 For how were you less important
than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me for
this wrong!
14 Look! I am ready to come to you a third time. I will not be a burden to you,
for I do not want what is yours. I want you. For children should not save up for the
parents. Instead, the parents should save up for the children. 15 I will most gladly
spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? 16 But as
it is, I did not burden you. But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by
deceit. 17 Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent to you? 18 I urged Titus to go
to you, and I sent the other brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did
we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?
19 Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you? In the
sight of God, we have in Christ been saying everything for your strengthening. 20 For
I fear that when I come I may not find you as I wish. I fear that you might not find
me as you wish. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger,
rivalries, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder. 21 I fear that when I come back,
my God might humble me before you. I fear that I might be grieved by many of those
who have sinned before now, and who did not repent of the impurity and sexual
immorality and lustful indulgence that they practiced.
13
1 This is the third time that I am coming to you.
“Every accusation must be
established by the evidence of two or three witnesses.” 2 I have already said to those
who sinned before and to all the rest when I was there the second time, and I say
it again: When I come again, I will not spare them. 3 I tell you this because you are
looking for evidence that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you.
Instead, he is powerful in you. 4 For he was crucified in weakness, but he is alive by
God's power. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of
God among you. 5 Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves.2 Corinthians 13:6
1212
2 Corinthians 13:14
Do you not realize this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless you have
failed the test. 6 And I trust that you will recognize that we have not failed the test.
7 Now we pray to God that you may not do any wrong. I do not pray that we may
appear to have passed the test. Instead, I pray that you may do what is right, although
we may seem to have failed the test. 8 For we are not able to do anything against the
truth, but only for the truth. 9 For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong.
We also pray that you may be made complete. 10 I write these things while I am away
from you, so that when I am with you I do not have to deal harshly with you in the
use of my authority—which the Lord gave to me, so that I may build you up, and not
tear you down.
11 Finally, brothers, rejoice! Work for restoration, be encouraged, agree with one
another, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you. 12 Greet each
other with a holy kiss.
13 All of the believers greet you. *
14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the
Holy Spirit be with all of you.
* 13:13 Some translations combine verse 13 with verse 12 and number verse 14 as verse 13.Galatians 1:1

Galatians 2:7
Galatians
1 Paul, an apostle—not an apostle from men nor by human agency, but through
Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— 2 and all the brothers
with me, to the churches of Galatia: 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ, 4 who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us
from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 5 to him be
the glory forever and ever. Amen.
6 I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly from him who called you by
the grace of Christ. I am amazed that you are turning to a different gospel. 7 This
is not to say that there is another gospel, but there are some men who cause you
trouble and want to change the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from
heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let
him be cursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, “If someone proclaims
to you a gospel other than the one you received, let him be cursed.” 10 For am I now
seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying
to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.
11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's gospel.
12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation
of Jesus Christ to me. 13 You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was
persecuting the church of God beyond measure and that I was trying to destroy it.
14 I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those who were my own age, from out of
my own people. That is how extremely zealous I was for the traditions of my fathers.
15 But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb, and who called me
through his grace, 16 was pleased to reveal his Son in me, so that I would proclaim
him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood. 17 I did
not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I went
to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.
18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas and I stayed
with him fifteen days. 19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's
brother. 20 In what I write to you, I assure you before God, that I am not lying. 21 Then
I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 22 I was still not personally known to the
churches of Judea that are in Christ. 23 They only heard it being said, “The man who
once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.” 24 So they
glorified God because of me.
2
1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking
Titus along with me. 2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them the
gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles. I spoke privately to those who seemed
to be important, in order to make sure that I was not running—or had not run—in
vain. 3 But not even Titus, who was with me and who was a Greek, was forced to
be circumcised. 4 The false brothers came in secretly to spy on the liberty we have
in Christ Jesus. They desired to make us slaves, 5 but we did not yield in submission
to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. 6 But
those who seemed to be important (whatever they were does not matter to me, God
shows no partiality)—those, I say, who seemed important added nothing to me. 7 On
the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to those who areGalatians 2:8
1214
Galatians 3:14
uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to those who are
circumcised. 8 For God, who worked in Peter for the apostleship to those who are
circumcised, also worked in me to the Gentiles. 9 When James, Cephas, and John,
who were recognized as those who built up the church, understood the grace that
had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me.
They did this so that we should go to the Gentiles, and so that they should go to those
who are circumcised. 10 They requested only that we remember the poor, the very
thing that I was eager to do.
11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he was
declared to be in the wrong. 12 Before certain men came from James, Cephas was
eating with the Gentiles. But when these men came, he stopped and kept away from
the Gentiles. He was afraid of those who were demanding circumcision. 13 Also the
rest of the Jews joined in this hypocrisy. Even Barnabas was led astray with them by
their hypocrisy. 14 But when I saw that their behavior was not following the truth of
the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all of them, “If you are a Jew but are living like
a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?” 15 We
ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; 16 yet we know that no person
is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Christ Jesus. We also came
to faith in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the
works of the law. For by the works of the law no flesh will be justified. 17 But if,
while we seek to be justified in Christ, we too, were found to be sinners, does Christ
then promote sin? Absolutely not! 18 For if I rebuild those things I once destroyed,
I prove myself to be a lawbreaker. 19 For through the law I died to the law, so that
I might live for God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live,
but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God,
who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if
righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing!
3
1 Foolish Galatians! Who has put a spell on you? It was before your eyes that Jesus
Christ was publicly displayed as crucified. 2 This is the only thing I want to learn
from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what
you heard? 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now going to
finish by the flesh? 4 Have you suffered so many things for nothing—if indeed it was
for nothing? 5 Does he who gives the Spirit to you and works miracles among you
do so by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith? 6 Just as Abraham “believed
God and it was credited to him as righteousness,” 7 in the same way, understand,
then, that those of faith are the children of Abraham. 8 The scripture, foreseeing that
God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham,
saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.” 9 So then, those of faith are blessed
along with Abraham, the man of faith. 10 All who rely on the works of the law are
under a curse; and so it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the
things written in the book of the law, and do them.” 11 Now it is clear that no one is
justified before God by the law, because “the righteous will live by faith.” 12 But the
law is not of faith, rather, “The person who does the works of the law must live by
them.” 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—
for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”— 14 so that the blessing of
Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive
the promise of the Spirit.Galatians 3:15
1215
Galatians 4:19
15 Brothers, let me speak in human terms. In a man-made contract, no one can set
it aside or add to it, once it is established by law. 16 Now the promises were spoken to
Abraham and to his descendant. It does not say, “to descendants,” referring to many,
but instead to only one, “and to your descendant,” who is Christ. 17 Now what I mean
is this: The law, which came 430 years afterward, does not set aside the covenant
previously established by God. 18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, then it no
longer comes by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by a promise. 19 What, then,
was the purpose of the law? It was added because of trespasses, until the descendant
of Abraham would come to whom the promise had been made. The law was put into
force through angels by a mediator. 20 Now a mediator implies more than one person,
but God is one. 21 So is the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if
a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would certainly have
come by the law. 22 But the scripture imprisoned everything under sin. God did this
so that the promise to save us by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who
believe.
23 Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until
faith should be revealed. 24 So then the law became our guardian until Christ came,
so that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer
under a guardian. 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For
as many of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male
nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 Then if you are Christ's, you are
Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to promise.
4
1 I am saying that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave,
though he is owner of the entire estate. 2 But he is under guardians and trustees until
the date set by his father. 3 So also, when we were children, we were enslaved to
the elemental principles of the world. 4 But when the fullness of time had come, God
sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law. 5 He did this to redeem those
under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. 6 And because you are sons,
God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls out, “Abba, Father.” 7 So
you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then you are also an heir through
God.
8 But at that time, when you did not know God, you were made to be slaves to those
who are, by their natural powers, not gods at all. 9 But now that you have come to
know God, or rather that you are known by God, how is it that you are turning back
to the weak and worthless elemental principles? Do you want to be enslaved all over
again? 10 You observe days and new moons and seasons and years! 11 I am afraid for
you that somehow my work with you may have been for nothing.
12 I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I also have become like you. You did me
no wrong. 13 But you know that it was because of a physical illness that I proclaimed
the gospel to you the first time. 14 Though my physical condition put you to the test,
you did not despise or reject me. Instead you welcomed me as if I were an angel
of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. 15 Where, then, is your blessing now? For
I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given
them to me. 16 So then, have I become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?
17 They are zealous to win you over, but for no good. They want to shut you out, so
you may be zealous for them. 18 It is always good to be zealous for a good purpose,
and not only when I am present with you. 19 My little children, again I am in theGalatians 4:20
1216
Galatians 5:21
pains of childbirth for you until Christ is formed in you. 20 I wish I could be present
with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.
21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? 22 For
it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave girl and one by the free
woman. 23 One was born by the slave girl according to the flesh, but the other was
born by the free woman through promise. 24 These things may be interpreted as
an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. One of them is from Mount
Sinai and she gives birth to children who are slaves. This is Hagar. 25 Now Hagar
represents Mount Sinai in Arabia; and she represents the present Jerusalem, for she
is in slavery with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is
our mother. 27 For it is written,
“Rejoice, you barren one who does not give birth;
cry out and shout for joy, you who are not suffering the pains of childbirth;
because the children of the abandoned woman are more numerous
than those of the woman who has a husband.”
28 But you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. 29 At that time the one who
was born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit. It is
the same now. 30 But what does the scripture say? “Send away the slave girl and her
son. For the son of the slave girl will not share in the inheritance with the son of the
free woman.” 31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the
free woman.
5
1 For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not again be put
under the control of a yoke of slavery.
2 Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will not
benefit you in any way. 3 I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised
that he is obligated to obey the whole law. 4 You are cut off from Christ, you who
would be justified by the law; you no longer experience grace. 5 For through the
Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. 6 In Christ Jesus neither
circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but only faith working through
love. 7 You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth? 8 This
persuasion does not come from him who calls you! 9 A little yeast makes the whole
batch of dough rise. 10 I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view.
The one who is troubling you will pay the penalty, whoever he is. 11 Brothers, if I still
proclaim circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling
block of the cross has been removed. 12 As for those who are disturbing you, I wish
they would castrate themselves!
13 For you were called to freedom, brothers. But do not use your freedom as an
opportunity for the sinful nature; rather, through love serve one another. 14 For the
whole law is fulfilled in one command: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”
15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by
one another.
16 But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the sinful
nature. 17 For the desires of the sinful nature are against the Spirit, and the desires
of the Spirit are against the sinful nature. For these are in conflict with each other, so
that you cannot do the things you want. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not
under the law. 19 Now the works of the sinful nature are evident: sexual immorality,
impurity, depravity, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger,
rivalry, dissension, divisions, 21 envy, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, and things
like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who practice such thingsGalatians 5:22

will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 23 gentleness, and self-control; against such things
there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature
with its passions and desires.
25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. 26 Let us not become
conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
6
1 Brothers, if someone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore
him in a spirit of gentleness. Be concerned about yourself, so you also may not be
tempted. 2 Carry one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 3 For if anyone
thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 4 Each one should
examine his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not
in someone else. 5 For each one will carry his own load.
6 The one who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who
teaches. 7 Do not be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man plants, that he
will also gather in. 8 For he who plants seed to his own sinful nature, from the sinful
nature will gather in destruction. The one who plants seed to the Spirit, from the
Spirit will gather in eternal life from the Spirit. 9 Let us not become weary in doing
good, for at the right time we will gather in a harvest, if we do not give up. 10 So
then, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who
belong to the household of faith.
11 See what large letters I write to you with my own hand. 12 Those who want to
make a good impression in the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They
do this only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. 13 For not even those
who circumcised themselves keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so
that they may boast about your flesh. 14 But may I never boast except in the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to
the world. 15 For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but
what counts is a new creation. 16 To all who live according to this standard, peace
and mercy be upon them, even upon the Israel of God.
17 From now on let no one trouble me, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus.
18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.Ephesians 1:1
1218
Ephesians 2:3
Ephesians
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to God's holy people in
Ephesus, who are faithful in Christ Jesus. * 2 Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be praised, who has blessed us
with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. 4 God chose us in him
from the beginning of the world, that we may be holy and blameless in his sight in love
†. 5 ‡ God chose us beforehand for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to
the good pleasure of his will. 6 Our adoption results in the praise of his glorious grace
that he has freely given us in the One he loves. 7 In Jesus Christ we have redemption
through his blood and the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. 8 He
lavished this grace upon us with all wisdom and understanding. 9 God made known
to us the hidden purpose of his will, according to what pleased him, and which he
demonstrated in Christ, 10 with a view to a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all
things together, all things in heaven and on earth, under one head, even Christ. 11 In
Christ we were appointed as heirs. We were decided on beforehand according to the
plan of him who works out everything according to the purpose of his will. 12 God
appointed us as heirs so that we might be the first to have a certain hope in Christ,
so we would be for the praise of his glory. 13 In Christ, you also, when you had heard
the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, you believed in him and were sealed
with the promised Holy Spirit, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we
take full possession of it, to the praise of his glory.
15 For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love
for all God's holy people, 16 I have not stopped thanking God for you as I mention you
in my prayers. 17 I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, will
give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. 18 I pray that
the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, that you may know the hope to which he
has called you and the riches of his glorious inheritance among all God's holy people.
19 In my prayers I ask that you may know the incomparable greatness of his power
toward us who believe, according to the working of his great strength. 20 This is the
same power that God worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated
him at his right hand in the heavenly places. 21 He seated Christ far above all rule
and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named. Christ will
rule, not only in this age, but also in the age to come. 22 God put all things under
Christ's feet and gave him to the church as head over all things. 23 The church is his
body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
2
1 And as for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
2 It was in these
trespasses and sins that you once lived according to the ways of this world. You were
living according to the ruler of the authorities of the air, the spirit that is working in
the sons of disobedience. 3 Once we all lived among these people, fulfilling the evil
desires of our sinful nature, and carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind.
* 1:1 Some early versions omit, in Ephesus, but this expression is probably in Paul's original letter.

‡ 1:5 Some
Some interpreters place the phrase in love with the next sentence, Eph. 1:5 In love God chose us .

1219
Ephesians 3:16
We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of humanity. 4 But God is rich in
mercy because of his great love with which he loved us. 5 While we were dead in
trespasses, he made us alive together in Christ—by grace you have been saved. 6 God
raised us up together with Christ, and God made us sit together in the heavenly places
in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the ages to come he might show to us the immeasurably
great riches of his grace expressed in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by
grace you have been saved through faith, and this did not come from you, it is the gift
of God, 9 not from works and so no one may boast. 10 For we are God's workmanship,
created in Christ Jesus to do good deeds that God planned long ago for us, so that we
would walk in them.
11 Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh. You are called
“uncircumcision” by what is called the “circumcision” in the flesh made by human
hands. 12 For at that time you were separated from Christ, foreigners to the people
of Israel, strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God
in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away from God have
been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he is our peace. He made the two one.
By his flesh he destroyed the wall of hostility that divided us. 15 That is, he abolished
the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create one new man in
himself, and so making peace. 16 Christ reconciles both peoples into one body to God
through the cross, putting to death the hostility. 17 Jesus came and proclaimed peace
to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. 18 For through Jesus
we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. 19 So then, now you Gentiles are
no longer strangers and foreigners. Instead you are fellow citizens with the saints
and members of God's household. 20 You have been built on the foundation of the
apostles and prophets, and Christ Jesus himself was the cornerstone. 21 In him the
whole building fits together and grows as a temple in the Lord. 22 It is in him that
you also are being built together as a dwelling place for God in the Spirit.
3
1 Because of this I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles. 2 I assume
that you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God that was given to me for
you. 3 I am writing according to the revelation made known to me. This is the hidden
truth about which I briefly wrote to you. 4 When you read about this, you will be able
to understand my insight into this hidden truth about Christ. 5 In other generations
this truth was not made known to the sons of men. But now it has been revealed by
the Spirit to his apostles and prophets who were set apart for this work. 6 This hidden
truth is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and they
share the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 7 For I became a servant of this
gospel by the gift of God's grace given to me through the working of his power. 8 This
grace was given to me, although I am the least of all the saints, that I should proclaim
to the Gentiles the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9 so that I will bring
to light for everyone the plan—the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all
things. 10 This plan was made known through the church so the rulers and authorities
in the heavenly places would come to know the many-sided nature of the wisdom of
God. 11 This happened according to the eternal plan that he accomplished in Christ
Jesus our Lord. 12 For in Christ we have boldness and access with confidence because
of our faith in him. 13 Therefore I ask you not to be discouraged because of what I
am suffering for you, which is your glory.
14 For this reason I bend my knees to the Father, 15 from whom every family in
heaven and on earth is named. 16 I pray that he would grant you, according to theEphesians 3:17
1220
Ephesians 4:28
riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power through his Spirit, who is in you.
17 I pray that Christ may live in your hearts through faith, that you will be rooted and
grounded in his love. 18 May you have strength so you can understand, along with
all the believers, what is the width, the length, the height, and the depth, 19 and that
you may know the love of Christ, which goes beyond knowledge, and that you may
be filled with all the fullness of God.
20 Now to him who is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think, according to
his power that works in us, 21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all
generations forever and ever. Amen.
4
1 I, therefore, as the prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk worthily of the calling
by which you were called. 2 I urge you to live with great humility and gentleness and
patience, putting up with one another in love. 3 Do your best to keep the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you
were called in one certain hope of your calling. 5 And there is one Lord, one faith,
one baptism, 6 and one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in
all. 7 To each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of
Christ. 8 It is as scripture says:
“When he ascended to the heights,
he led the captives into captivity,
and he gave gifts to the people.”
9 What is the meaning of “He ascended,” except that he also descended into the lower
regions of the earth? 10 He who descended is the same person who also ascended far
above all the heavens, that he might fill all things. 11 Christ gave some to be apostles,
some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers. 12 He gave
these offices to equip the saints for the work of service, for the building up of the
body of Christ. 13 He continues to build up his body until we all reach the unity of
faith and knowledge of the Son of God, and that we become mature and so reach the
measure of the fullness of Christ. 14 Christ builds us up so that we should no longer
be children who are tossed back and forth by the waves, and carried away by every
wind of teaching and by the trickery of people in their deceitful schemes. 15 Instead,
speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head,
that is, Christ. 16 Christ builds the whole body, and it is joined and held together by
every supporting ligament, and when each part works together, that makes the body
grow so that it builds itself up in love.
17 Therefore, I say and insist on this in the Lord, that you must no longer live
as the Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds. 18 They are darkened in their
understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in
them, because of the hardness of their hearts. 19 They have no shame and have
handed themselves over to sensuality, and they are continually practicing every kind
of impurity. 20 But that is not how you learned about Christ. 21 I assume that you have
heard about him, and that you were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus. 22 You
were taught to put off what belongs to your former manner of life, to put off the old
man. It is the old man that is corrupt because of its deceitful desires. 23 You were
taught to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 24 and to put on the new man that
is created in the image of God—in true righteousness and holiness.
25 Therefore, get rid of lies, and let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,
because we are members of one another. 26 Be angry and do not sin. Do not let the sun
go down on your anger. 27 Do not give an opportunity to the devil. 28 The one who hadEphesians 4:29
1221
Ephesians 5:32
been stealing must steal no longer. He must labor, doing useful work with his hands,
so that he may have something to share with those who are in need. 29 Do not let
any filthy talk come out of your mouth. Use only words that are helpful for building
others up, according to their needs, that your words would be helpful to those who
hear you. 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, for it is by him that you were
sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Put away all bitterness, rage, anger, quarreling,
and insults, along with every kind of evil. 32 Be kind to each other, tenderhearted,
forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you.
5
1 Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children. 2 And walk in love, as
also Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to
God.
3 But there must not be even a suggestion among you of sexual immorality or any
kind of impurity or of greed, for these are improper for God's holy people. 4 Let
there be no filthiness, no foolish talk, and no crude jokes—all of which are improper.
Instead there should be thanksgiving. 5 For you can be sure of this, that no sexually
immoral, impure, or greedy person—that is, an idolater—has any inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and God. 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because
of these things the anger of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience. 7 Therefore,
do not join in with them. 8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the
Lord. Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness,
righteousness, and truth), 10 and find out what is pleasing to the Lord. 11 Do not
associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them. 12 For it
is shameful even to mention the things they do in secret. 13 But when anything is
illuminated by the light, it becomes visible. 14 For anything that becomes visible is
light. Therefore it says,
“Awake, you sleeper,
and arise from the dead,
and Christ will shine on you.”
15 Look carefully how you live—not as unwise but as wise. 16 Redeem the time
because the days are evil. 17 Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the
will of the Lord is. 18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that leads to reckless
behavior. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit, 19 speaking to each other in psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your
heart, 20 always giving thanks for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to
God the Father, 21 submitting yourselves to one another in reverence for Christ.
22 Wives, submit to your husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head
of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church, and Christ himself is its savior.
24 But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives must submit to their husbands
in everything. 25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her. 26 Christ gave himself for the church so that he might make her
holy, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 27 so that he might
present her to himself as glorious, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but
holy and without fault. 28 In the same way husbands ought to love their own wives
as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. 29 For no one ever
hated his own body, but nourishes and treats it with care, just as Christ nourishes
and treats the church with care, 30 because we are members of his body. 31 “For this
reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the
two will become one flesh.” 32 This hidden truth is great—but I am speaking aboutEphesians 5:33
1222
Ephesians 6:24
Christ and the church. 33 Nevertheless, each of you also must love his own wife as
himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
6
1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2 “Honor your father
and mother” (which is the first commandment with promise), 3 “so that it may be
well with you and you may live long on the earth.” 4 Fathers, do not provoke your
children to anger. Instead, raise them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
5 Slaves, be obedient to your human masters with deep respect and trembling, in the
honesty of your heart. Be obedient to them as you would be obedient to Christ. 6 Be
obedient not only when your masters are watching in order to please them. Instead,
be obedient as slaves of Christ, who do the will of God from your heart. 7 Serve with
all your heart, as though you were serving the Lord and not people, 8 because we
know that for whatever good deed each person does, he will receive a reward from
the Lord, whether he is slave or free.
9 Masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them. You know that
he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with
him.
10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. 11 Put on the
whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the scheming plans of
the devil. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers,
against the authorities, against the powers over this present darkness, against the
spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore put on the whole armor
of God, so that you may be able to stand in this time of evil, and after you have
done everything, to stand firm. 14 Stand, therefore, after you have put on the belt
of truth and the breastplate of righteousness. 15 Then as shoes for your feet, put on
the readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace. 16 In all circumstances take up the
shield of faith, by which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil
one. 17 And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God. 18 With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit. To this
end, always be watching with all perseverance, as you offer prayers for all the saints.
19 And pray for me, that a message might be given to me when I open my mouth.
Pray that I might make known with boldness the hidden truth about the gospel. 20 It
is for the gospel that I am an ambassador who is kept in chains, so that I may declare
it boldly, as I ought to speak.
21 Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you
everything, so that you may know how I am doing. 22 I have sent him to you for
this very purpose, so that you may know how we are, and so that he may encourage
your hearts.
23 Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ. 24 Grace be to all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an
incorruptible love.Philippians 1:1
1223
Philippians 2:1
Philippians
1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all those set apart in Christ Jesus
who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons. 2 May grace be to you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 I thank my God every time I remember you; 4 and always in every prayer for all
of you, I pray with joy. 5 I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first
day until now. 6 I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work
in you will continue to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me
to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been
my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation
of the gospel. 8 For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion
of Christ Jesus. 9 I am praying this: That your love may abound more and more in
knowledge and all understanding. 10 I pray for this so that you may approve what is
excellent, and so you may be sincere and without offense on the day of Christ. 11 I
pray that you also will be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through
Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really
served to advance the gospel. 13 As a result, my chains in Christ came to light
throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else. 14 Most of the brothers
have far more confidence in the Lord because of my chains, and they have courage
to fearlessly speak the word. 15 Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and
strife, and also others out of good will. 16 The latter do it out of love, knowing that I
am put here for the defense of the gospel. 17 But the former proclaim Christ out of
selfish ambition, not sincerely. They think they will afflict me while I am in chains.
18 What then? Only that in every way—whether from false motives or from true—
Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, 19 for I know that
this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ. 20 It is my eager expectation and certain hope that I will in no way be
ashamed, but that I will have complete boldness, so that now as always, Christ will
be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to live is Christ
and to die is gain. 22 But if I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for
me. Yet which to choose? I do not know. 23 For I am hard pressed between the two.
My desire is to depart and be with Christ, which is far better, 24 yet to remain in the
flesh is more necessary for your sake. 25 Being convinced of this, I know that I will
remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that
in me you may have increasing reasons to boast in Christ Jesus when I come to you
again. 27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that
whether I come to see you or am absent, I may hear about you, that you are standing
firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel. 28 Do
not be frightened in any respect by those who are your opponents. This is a sign to
them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this from God. 29 For it has been
granted to you, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for
his sake, 30 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now you hear in me.
2
1 If there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort from his love, if
there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if there are any tender mercies and compassions,Philippians 2:2
1224
Philippians 3:3
2 then make my joy full by thinking alike, having the same love, being united in
spirit, and having the same purpose. 3 Do nothing out of selfishness or empty conceit.
Instead with humility consider others better than yourselves. 4 Each of you should
take care not only for your own needs, but also for the needs of others. 5 You should
have the same attitude toward one another as was in Christ Jesus.
6 He existed in the form of God,
but he did not consider his equality with God
as something to hold on to.
7 Instead, he emptied himself
by taking the form of a servant,
and he was born in the likeness of men.
8 He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death,
even death of a cross!
9 Therefore God also highly exalted him.
He gave him the name that is above every name.
10 He did this so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend,
the knees of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
11 He did this so that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.
12 So then, my beloved, as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much
more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 13 For it
is God who is working in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. 14 Do
all things without complaining or arguing. 15 Act in this way so that you may become
blameless and honest, children of God without blemish. Act in this way so that you
may shine as lights in the world, in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation.
16 Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory on the day of
Christ. For then I will know that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17 But even
if I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I
am glad and rejoice with you all. 18 In the same manner you also should be glad and
rejoice with me.
19 But I have hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also
be encouraged when I know the things about you. 20 For I have no one else with his
same attitude, who is truly anxious for you. 21 For they all seek their own interests,
not the things of Jesus Christ. 22 But you know his worth, because as a child serves
his father, so he served with me in the gospel. 23 So I hope to send him as soon as I
see how things will go with me. 24 But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will
also come soon. 25 But I think it is necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you. He
is my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and servant
for my needs. 26 For he was very distressed, and he longed to be with you all, because
you heard that he was sick. 27 For indeed he was so sick that he almost died. But
God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, so that I might not have
sorrow upon sorrow. 28 So it is all the more eagerly that I am sending him, so that
when you see him again you may rejoice, and I can be free from anxiety. 29 Welcome
Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy. Honor people like him. 30 For it was for the
work of Christ that he came near death. He risked his life to serve me and fill up
what you could not do in service to me.
3
1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write these same things again
to you is no trouble for me, and it keeps you safe. 2 Watch out for the dogs, those
evil workers, those who mutilate the flesh. 3 For it is we who are the circumcision. ItPhilippians 3:4
1225
Philippians 4:9
is we who worship by the Spirit of God. It is we who take pride in Christ Jesus, and
who have no confidence in the flesh. 4 Even so, I myself could have confidence in the
flesh. If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more. 5 I
was circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a
Hebrew of Hebrews; with regard to the law, a Pharisee. 6 As for zeal, I persecuted the
church; as for righteousness under the law, I was blameless. 7 But whatever things
were a profit for me, I have considered them as loss because of Christ. 8 In fact, now I
count all things to be loss because of the surpassing value of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord. For him I have given up all things—and I consider them rubbish—so
that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him. I do not have a righteousness of my
own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness that is through faith in Christ,
the righteousness that is from God based on faith. 10 So now I want to know him
and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. I want to
be transformed into the likeness of his death, 11 so somehow I may experience the
resurrection from the dead. 12 It is not true that I have already received these things,
or that I have become complete. But I press on in order that I may grasp that for
which I was grasped by Christ Jesus. 13 Brothers, I do not think that I myself have
yet grasped it. But there is one thing: I forget what is behind and strain for what is
ahead. 14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God
in Christ Jesus. 15 All of us who are mature, let us think this way; and if you think
differently about anything, God will also reveal that to you. 16 However, whatever we
have reached, let us hold on to it.
17 Be imitators of me, brothers. Closely watch those who are walking by the example
that you have in us. 18 Many are walking—those about whom I have often told you,
and now I am telling you with tears—as enemies of the cross of Christ. 19 Their end
is destruction. For their god is their stomach, and their pride is in their shame. They
think about earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also
wait for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. 21 He will transform our lowly bodies into
bodies formed like his glorious body, formed by the might of his power to subject all
things to himself.

1 Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for, my joy and crown, in this way
stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends.
2 I am pleading with Euodia, and I am pleading with Syntyche, be of the same
mind in the Lord. 3 Yes, I ask you, my true companion, to help these women who
labored with me in spreading the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my
fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice. 5 Let your gentleness be
known to all people. The Lord is near. 6 Do not be anxious about anything. Instead,
in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be known
to God, 7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your
hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable,
whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely,
whatever things are of good report, if there is anything excellent, if there is anything
to be praised, think about these things. 9 The things that you have learned and
received and heard and seen in me, do these things, and the God of peace will be
with you.Philippians 4:10

Philippians 4:23
10 I greatly rejoice in the Lord because now at last you have renewed your concern
for me. You had indeed been concerned for me before, but there was no opportunity
for you to help. 11 I am not saying this because I am in need. For I have learned
to be content in all circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be poor, and I also know
what it is to have plenty. In every way and in all things I have learned the secret of
how to be well-fed or to be hungry, and how to have an abundance or to be in need.
13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me. 14 However, you did well to
share with me in my difficulties. 15 You Philippians know that in the beginning of the
gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church supported me in the matter of giving and
receiving except you alone. 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for
my needs more than once. 17 It is not that I seek the gift. Instead, I seek the fruit that
increases to your credit. 18 I have received everything in full, and even more. I have
been well-supplied now that I have received from Epaphroditus the things you sent.
They are a sweet-smelling aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. 19 My
God will meet all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 20 Now
to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
21 Greet every believer in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
22 All the believers here greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.

to you, and peace from God our Father. *
3 We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and we always pray for
you. 4 We have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for
all those set apart for God. 5 You have this love because of the certain hope reserved
for you in heaven. You heard about this confident expectation before in the word
of truth, the gospel, 6 which has come to you. This gospel is bearing fruit and is
growing in all the world. It has been doing this in you also from the day you heard
it and learned about the grace of God in truth. 7 This is the gospel as you learned it
from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our
behalf. † 8 Epaphras has made known to us your love in the Spirit.
9 Because of this love, from the day we heard this we have not stopped praying
for you. We have been asking that you will be filled with the knowledge of his will
in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. 10 We have been praying that you will
walk worthily of the Lord in pleasing ways. We have been praying that you will bear
fruit in every good deed and that you will grow in the knowledge of God. 11 We pray
you may be strengthened in every ability according to the power of his glory into all
perseverance and patience. 12 We pray that you will joyfully give thanks to the Father,
who has made you able to have a share in the inheritance of the saints in light. ‡ 13 He
has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of
his beloved Son. 14 In his Son we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. § 15 The
Son is the image of the invisible God. He is the firstborn of all creation. 16 For by him
all things were created, those in the heavens and those on the earth, the visible and
the invisible things. Whether thrones or dominions or governments or authorities,
all things were created by him and for him. 17 He himself is before all things, and
in him all things hold together. 18 He is the head of the body, the church. He is
the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so he has first place among
all things. 19 For God was pleased that all his fullness should live in him, 20 and to
reconcile through the Son all things to himself. God made peace through the blood
of his cross. God reconciled all things to himself, whether the things on the earth or
the things in heaven. 21 At one time, you also were strangers to God and were his
enemies in mind and in evil deeds. 22 But now he has reconciled you by his physical
body through death. He did this in order to present you holy, blameless, and above
reproach before him, 23 if you continue in the faith, established and firm, not moved
away from the certain hope of the gospel that you heard. This is the gospel that was
proclaimed to every person created under heaven. This is the gospel of which I, Paul,
became a servant.
24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking
of the afflictions of Christ for the sake of his body, which is the church. 25 It is of this
church that I am a servant, according to the responsibility from God that was given
to me for you, to fulfill the word of God. 26 This is the secret truth that was hidden
for ages and for generations. But now it has been revealed to those who believe in

him. 27 It is to them that God wanted to make known the riches of the glory of this
secret truth among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 28 This is he
whom we proclaim. We admonish every person, and we teach every person with all
wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Christ. 29 For this I labor
and strive according to his energy that is at work in me in power.
2
1 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have had for you, for those at
Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh. 2 I work so that
their hearts may be encouraged by being brought together in love and into all the
riches of full assurance of understanding, into the knowledge of the secret truth of
God, that is, Christ. 3 In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
4 I say this so that no one may trick you with persuasive speech. 5 Although I am not
with you in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit. I rejoice to see your good order and
the strength of your faith in Christ.
6 As you received Christ the Lord, walk in him. 7 Be rooted in him, be built on him,
be established in faith just as you were taught, and abound in thanksgiving.
8 See that no one captures you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to
the tradition of men, conforming to the elements of the world, and not conforming to
Christ. 9 For in him all the fullness of God lives in bodily form. 10 You have been filled
in him, who is the head over every power and authority. 11 In him you were also
circumcised with a circumcision not done by humans in the removal of the body of
flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ. 12 You were buried with him in baptism, and
in him you were raised up through faith in the power of God, who raised him from
the dead. 13 When you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of
your flesh, he made you alive together with him and forgave us all of our trespasses.
* 14 He canceled the written record of debts that stood against us with its regulations.
He took it away by nailing it to the cross. 15 He disarmed the powers and authorities
and made a public spectacle of them, by being victorious over them by the cross.
16 So then, let no one judge you in eating or in drinking, or about a feast day or a
new moon, or about Sabbath days. 17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but
the substance is Christ. 18 Let no one who wants humility and the worship of angels
judge you out of your prize. Such a person enters into the things he has seen and
becomes puffed up by his fleshly thinking. 19 He does not hold on to the head. It is
from the head that the whole body throughout its joints and ligaments is supplied
and held together; it grows with the growth given by God.
20 If you died together with Christ to the elements of the world, why do you live as
obligated to the world: 21 “Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch”? 22 All these things
will perish with use, according to the instructions and teachings of men. 23 These
rules have the wisdom of self-made religion and humility and severity of the body.
But they have no value against the indulgence of the flesh.
3
1 If then God has raised you with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is
sitting at the right hand of God. 2 Think about the things above, not about the things
on earth. 3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4 When
Christ appears, who is your life, then you will also appear with him in glory. *

5 Put to death, then, the members that are on earth—sexual immorality, unclean-
ness, passion, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry. 6 It is for these things that the
wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience. † 7 It is in these things that you
also once walked when you lived in them. 8 But now you must get rid of all these
things—wrath, anger, evil intentions, insults, and obscene speech from your mouth.
9 Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old man with its practices,
10 and you have put on the new man that is being made new in knowledge according
to the image of the one who created it. 11 This is where there is no Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is
all, and is in all.
12 Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, put on a heart of mercy,
kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 13 Bear with one another. Be gracious
to each other. If someone has a complaint against someone else, forgive in the same
way that the Lord has forgiven you. 14 Above all these things, have love, which is the
bond of perfection. 15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts. It was for this peace
that you were called in one body. And be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ live in
you richly. With all wisdom teach and admonish one another with psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs. Sing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 17 Whatever you
do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. Give thanks to God the
Father through him.
18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as it is appropriate in the Lord. 19 Husbands,
love your wives, and do not be bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in
all things, for this is pleasing in the Lord. 21 Fathers, do not provoke your children, so
that they will not be discouraged. 22 Slaves, obey your masters according to the flesh
in all things, not with eyeservice as people pleasers, but with a sincere heart. Fear
the Lord. 23 Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not as to people.
24 You know that you will receive from the Lord the reward of the inheritance. It
is the Lord Christ whom you serve. 25 For anyone who does unrighteousness will
receive the penalty for the unrighteousness that he did, and there is no favoritism.

2 Continue steadfastly in prayer. Stay alert in it in thanksgiving. 3 Pray together
for us also, that God would open a door for the word, to speak the secret truth of
Christ. Because of this, I am chained up. 4 Pray that I may make it clear, as I ought
to speak. 5 Walk in wisdom toward those outside, and redeem the time. 6 Let your
words always be with grace. Let them be seasoned with salt, so that you may know
how you should answer each person.
7 As for the things concerning me, Tychicus will make them known to you. He is a

your hearts. * 9 I sent him together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother,
who is one of you. They will tell you everything that has happened here.

for the kingdom of God. They have been a comfort to me. 12 Epaphras greets you.
He is one of you and a slave of Christ Jesus. He always strives for you in prayer, so
that you may stand complete and fully assured in all the will of God. 13 For I bear
witness of him, that he works hard for you, for those in Laodicea, and for those in
Hierapolis. 14 Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 15 Greet the brothers
in Laodicea, and Nympha, and the church that is in her house. 16 When this letter
has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and see
that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 17 Say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry
that you have received in the Lord, that you should fulfill it.”

2 We always give thanks to God for all of you, as we mention you in our prayers.
3 We remember without ceasing before our God and Father your work of faith, labor
of love, and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 4 Brothers loved by God,
we know he has chosen you, 5 because our gospel came to you not in word only, but
also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance. In the same way, you also
know what kind of men we were among you for your sake. 6 You became imitators
of us and of the Lord, as you received the word in much hardship with joy from the
Holy Spirit. 7 As a result, you became an example to all in Macedonia and Achaia who
believe. 8 For from you the word of the Lord has rung out, and not only in Macedonia
and Achaia—everywhere your faith in God has gone out. Therefore we do not need
to say anything about it. 9 For they themselves report what kind of coming we had
among you. They tell how you turned to God from the idols to serve the living and
true God. 10 They report that you are waiting for his Son from heaven, whom he
raised from the dead. This is Jesus, who frees us from the wrath to come.
2
1 For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not useless. 2 You
know that we previously suffered and were shamefully treated at Philippi. We were
bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggling. 3 For our
exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit. 4 Instead, just as
we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak. We speak,
not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts. 5 For we
never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed— God
is our witness. 6 Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others.
We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ. 7 Instead, we were as gentle
among you as a mother comforting her own children. * 8 In this way we had affection
for you. We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our
own lives. For you had become very dear to us. 9 For you remember, brothers, our
labor and toil. Night and day we were working so that we might not weigh down any
of you. During that time, we preached to you the gospel of God. 10 You are witnesses,
and God also, how holy, righteous, and blameless was our behavior toward you who
believe. 11 In the same way you know how we dealt with each one of you as a father
deals with his own children. 12 We were begging you and encouraging and urging
you to walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom
and glory.
13 For this reason we also thank God constantly. For when you received from us
God's message that you heard, you accepted it not as the word of man. Instead, you
received it as it truly is, the word of God. It is this word that is also at work among
you who believe. 14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God that
are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own
countrymen, as they did from the Jews. 15 It was the Jews who killed both the Lord
* 1:1 Some older versions read, May grace and peace be to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
* 2:7 Some other versions read, Instead, we were like babies among you, as when a mother comforts her own
children .1 Thessalonians 2:16
1232
1 Thessalonians 4:12
Jesus and the prophets. It was the Jews who drove us out. They do not please God.
Instead, they are hostile to all people. 16 They forbid us to speak to the Gentiles for
them to be saved. The result is that they always fill up their own sins. Wrath must
come on them in the end.
17 We were separated from you, brothers, for a short time, in person not in heart.
We were especially eager, with great desire, to see your face. 18 For we wished to
come to you—I, Paul, wished to come to you once and again—but Satan stopped us.
19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of pride in front of our Lord Jesus at his
coming? Is it not you just as much as others? 20 For you are our glory and our joy.
3
1 Therefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it was good to be left
behind at Athens alone. 2 We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God
in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith. * 3 We
did this so that no one would be shaken by these sufferings. For yourselves know
that for this we have been appointed. 4 Truly, when we were with you, we told you
in advance that we were about to suffer affliction, and that happened, as you know.
5 For this reason, when I could no longer stand it, I sent that I might know about your
faith. Perhaps the tempter had somehow tempted you, and our labor was in vain.
6 But Timothy came to us from you and brought us the good news of your faith and
love. He told us that you always have good memories of us, and that you long to see
us just as we also long to see you. 7 Because of this, brothers, we were comforted by
you because of your faith, in all our distress and affliction. 8 For now we live, if you
stand firm in the Lord. 9 For what thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy
that we have before our God over you? 10 Night and day we pray very hard that we
may see your face and provide what is lacking in your faith.
11 May our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you.
12 May the Lord make you increase and abound in love one for another and toward
all people, as we also do for you. 13 May he strengthen your hearts, so that they will
be blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
with all his saints.
4
1 Finally, brothers, we encourage and exhort you in the Lord Jesus. As you received
instructions from us about how you must walk and please God, also in this way walk,
so that you do so even more. 2 For you know what instructions we gave you through
the Lord Jesus. 3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you avoid sexual
immorality, 4 that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in holiness and
honor, 5 not in the passion of lust (as the Gentiles who do not know God). 6 Let no
man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is an avenger in
all these things, just as we forewarned you and testified. 7 For God did not call us to
uncleanness, but to holiness. 8 Therefore, he who rejects this rejects not people, but
God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
9 Regarding brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you
yourselves are taught by God to love one another. 10 Indeed, you do this for all the
brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, to do this even more.
11 We also exhort you to aspire to live quietly, take care of your own responsibilities,
and work with your hands, just as we commanded you, 12 so that you may walk
properly before outsiders and not be in any need.
* 3:2 Some other versions read, We sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the gospel of Christ .1 Thessalonians 4:13
1233
1 Thessalonians 5:28
13 We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who sleep, so that
you do not grieve like the rest who do not have hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, even so God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep
in him. 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who
are left at the coming of the Lord, will surely not go before those who have fallen
asleep. 16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven. He will come with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ
will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be
caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. In this way we will always be
with the Lord. 18 Therefore, comfort one another with these words.
5
1 Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything
be written to you. 2 For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord
is coming like a thief in the night. 3 When they say, “Peace and safety,” then sudden
destruction will come on them. It will be like birth pains in a pregnant woman. They
will in no way escape. 4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that the day would
overtake you like a thief. 5 For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We
are not sons of the night or the darkness. 6 So then, let us not sleep as the rest do.
Instead, let us keep watch and be sober. 7 For those who sleep do so at night, and
those who get drunk do so at night. 8 But since we belong to the day, we must stay
sober and put on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation for our
helmet. 9 For God did not appoint us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our
Lord Jesus Christ. 10 It is he who died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep,
we may live together with him. 11 Therefore comfort one another and build each
other up, just as you are already doing.
12 We ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and who are
over you in the Lord and who admonish you. 13 We also ask you to regard them
highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 14 We exhort
you, brothers: Warn the disorderly, encourage the discouraged, help the weak, and
be patient toward all. 15 See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone. Instead,
pursue what is good for one another and for all. 16 Rejoice always. 17 Pray without
ceasing. 18 In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for
you. 19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies. 21 Test all things. Hold
on to what is good. 22 Avoid every appearance of evil.
23 May the God of peace make you completely holy. May your whole spirit, soul, and
body be preserved without blame for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 Faithful
is he who calls you, the one who will also do it.
25 Brothers, pray also for us.
26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 27 I solemnly charge you by the Lord to
have this letter read to all the brothers.
28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.2 Thessalonians 1:1
1234
2 Thessalonians 2:13
Second Thessalonians
1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 We should always give thanks to God for you, brothers. For this is appropriate,
because your faith is growing more and more, and the love each of you has for one
another increases. 4 So we ourselves speak proudly about you among the churches of
God. We talk about your patience and faith in all your persecutions. We talk about
the afflictions that you endure. 5 This is a sign of God's righteous judgment. The result
is that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which you suffer.
6 It is righteous for God to return affliction to those who afflict you, 7 and relief to
you who are afflicted with us. He will do this at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from
heaven with the angels of his power. 8 In flaming fire he will take vengeance on those
who do not know God and on those who do not respond to the gospel of our Lord
Jesus. 9 They will be punished with eternal destruction away from the presence of
the Lord and from the glory of his power. 10 He will do this when he comes on that
day to be glorified by his people and to be marveled at by all those who believed. For
our testimony to you was believed. 11 Because of this we also pray continually for
you. We pray that our God will consider you worthy of your calling. We pray that he
will fulfill every desire of goodness and every work of faith with power. 12 We pray
these things so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified by you. We pray
that you will be glorified by him, because of the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
2
1 Now about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together
to be with him, we ask you, brothers, 2 that you not be easily disturbed or troubled,
either by a spirit, by a message, or by a letter that seems to be coming from us, to the
effect that the day of the Lord has already come. 3 Let no one deceive you in any way.
For it will not come until after the falling away comes, and the man of lawlessness
is revealed, the son of destruction. * 4 This is he who opposes and exalts himself
against all that is called God or that is worshiped. As a result, he sits in the temple
of God and exhibits himself as God. 5 Do you not remember that when I was with
you I told you these things? 6 Now you know what restrains him, so that he will be
revealed only at the right time. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already working,
only there is someone who restrains him now until he is taken out of the way. 8 Then
the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his
mouth. The Lord will bring him to nothing by the revelation of his coming. 9 The
lawless one's coming will be due to the work of Satan with all power, signs, and false
wonders, 10 and with all deceit of unrighteousness. These things will be for those who
are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth for them to be saved.
11 For this reason God is sending them a work of error so that they would believe a
lie. 12 The result is that they will all be judged, those who did not believe the truth
but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness.
13 But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord. For
God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief
* 2:3 Some older versions read, and the man of sin is revealed .2 Thessalonians 2:14
1235
2 Thessalonians 3:18
in the truth. † 14 He called you to this through our gospel, that you might obtain the
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold tightly to the
traditions that you were taught, whether by word or by our letter.
16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and
gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 17 comfort and establish your
hearts in every good work and word.
3
1 Now, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may rush and be glorified,
as it also is with you. 2 Pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people,
for not all have faith. 3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you
from the evil one. 4 We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you both do and
will continue to do the things that we command. 5 May the Lord direct your hearts
to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.
6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you
avoid every brother who lives a lazy life and does not live according to the traditions
you received from us. 7 For you yourselves know it is proper for you to imitate us.
We did not live among you as those who had no discipline. 8 We did not eat anyone's
food without paying for it. Instead, we worked night and day in difficult labor and
hardship, so we might not be a burden to any of you. 9 We did this not because we
have no authority. Instead, we did this in order to be an example to you, so that you
may imitate us. 10 When we were with you, we commanded you, “The one who is
unwilling to work must not eat.” 11 For we hear that some walk idly among you. They
do not work but are instead meddlers. 12 Now such ones we command and exhort in
the Lord Jesus Christ, that they should work with quietness and eat their own food.
13 But you, brothers, do not become tired of doing what is right. 14 If anyone does
not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and have no association with him,
so that he may be ashamed. 15 Do not consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a
brother.
16 May the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. May the
Lord be with you all. 17 This is my greeting, Paul, with my own hand, which is the
sign in every letter. This is how I write. 18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all.

1 Timothy 2:10
First Timothy
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior
and Christ Jesus our hope, 2 to Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and
peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3 As I urged you to do when I was leaving for Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that
you can command certain people not to teach a different doctrine. 4 Neither should
they pay attention to stories and endless genealogies. These cause arguments rather
than helping the plan of God, which is by faith. 5 Now the goal of the commandment
is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from a sincere faith. 6 Some
people have missed the mark and have turned away from these things to foolish talk.
7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are
saying or what they so confidently affirm. 8 But we know that the law is good if one
uses it lawfully. 9 We know this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for
a lawless and rebellious people, for ungodly people and sinners, and for those who
are godless and profane. It is made for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for
murderers, 10 for sexually immoral people, for homosexuals, for those who kidnap
people for slaves, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else is against faithful
instruction. 11 This instruction is according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God
with which I have been entrusted.
12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord. He strengthened me, for he considered me faithful,
and he placed me into service. 13 I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man.
But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief. 14 But the grace of our
Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus. 15 This message is reliable
and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
I am the worst of these. 16 But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the
foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all patience. He did this as an example for
those who would trust in him for eternal life. 17 Now to the king of the ages, the
immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
18 I am placing this command before you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the
prophecies previously made about you, that you might fight the good fight, 19 holding
faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have shipwrecked their faith.
20 Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I gave over to Satan so that they may
be taught not to blaspheme.
2
1 Therefore first of all, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings
be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we
may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 3 This is good and
acceptable before God our savior. 4 He desires all people to be saved and to come to
the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator for God
and man, the man Christ Jesus. 6 He gave himself as a ransom for all, as the testimony
at the right time. 7 For this purpose, I myself, was made a herald and an apostle. I
am telling the truth. I am not lying. I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
8 Therefore, I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands without
anger or arguing. 9 Likewise, I want the women to dress themselves in proper
clothing, with modesty and self-control. They should not have braided hair, or gold,
or pearls, or expensive clothing. 10 I want them to dress with what is appropriate1 Timothy 2:11
1237
1 Timothy 4:10
for women who profess godliness through good works. 11 A woman should learn in
silence and with all submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise
authority over a man, but to live in quietness. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
14 Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
15 However, she will be saved through bearing children, if they continue in faith and
love and sanctification with soundness of mind.
3
1 This saying is trustworthy: If someone desires to be an overseer, he desires a good
work. 2 Therefore the overseer must be without reproach. He must be a husband of
one wife. He must be moderate, sensible, orderly, and hospitable. He must be able to
teach. 3 He must not be addicted to wine, not a brawler, but instead, gentle, peaceful.
He must not be a lover of money. 4 He should manage his own household well, and
his children should obey him with all respect. 5 For if a man does not know how to
manage his own household, how will he care for a church of God? 6 He should not be
a new convert, so that he does not swell with pride and might fall into condemnation
as the devil. 7 He must also have a good reputation with those outside, so that he
does not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil. 8 Deacons, likewise, should be
dignified, not double-talkers. They should not drink too much wine or be greedy.
9 They should keep the revealed truth of the faith with a clean conscience. 10 They
should also be approved first, then they should serve because they are blameless.
11 Women in the same way should be dignified. They should not be slanderers. They
should be moderate and faithful in all things. 12 Deacons must be husbands of one
wife. They must manage well their children and household. 13 For those who have
served well acquire for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith
that is in Christ Jesus.
14 I am writing these things to you, and I expect to come to you soon. 15 But if I
delay, I am writing so that you may know how to behave in the household of God,
which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth. 16 It is
undeniable that the revealed truth of godliness is great:
“He appeared in the flesh,
was justified by the Spirit,
was seen by angels,
was proclaimed among nations,
was believed on in the world,
and was taken up in glory.”
4
1 Now the Spirit clearly says that in later times some people will leave the faith and
pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons 2 in lying hypocrisy.
Their own consciences will be branded. 3 They will forbid to marry and to receive
foods that God created for sharing with thanksgiving among those who believe and
who know the truth. 4 For everything created by God is good. Nothing that we take
with thanksgiving is to be rejected. 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
6 If you place these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus
Christ. For you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching
that you have followed. 7 But reject worldly stories loved by old women. Instead, train
yourself in godliness. 8 For bodily training is a little useful, but godliness is useful for
all things. It holds promise for this life now and the life to come. 9 This message is
trustworthy and worthy of full acceptance. 10 For it is for this that we struggle and1 Timothy 4:11
1238
1 Timothy 6:1
work very hard. For we have hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people,
but especially of believers. 11 Proclaim and teach these things. 12 Let no one despise
your youth. Instead, be an example for those who believe, in speech, conduct, love,
faithfulness, and purity. 13 Until I come, attend to the reading, to the exhortation,
and to the teaching. 14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you
through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders. 15 Care for these
things. Be in them, so that your progress may be evident to all people. 16 Give careful
attention to yourself and to the teaching. Continue in these things. For by doing so,
you will save yourself and those who listen to you.
1 Do not scold an older man.
5
Instead, exhort him as if he were a father. Exhort
younger men as if they were brothers. 2 Exhort older women as mothers, and younger
women as sisters in all purity. 3 Honor widows, the real widows. 4 But if a widow has
children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show honor in their own household.
Let them repay their parents, because this is pleasing to God. 5 But a real widow is
left all alone. She puts her certain hope in God. She always remains with requests
and prayers both night and day. 6 However, the woman who lives for pleasure is
dead, even though she is still alive. 7 Give these instructions as well, so that they may
be blameless. 8 But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, especially for
those of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
9 Let a woman be enrolled as a widow who is not younger than sixty, a wife of one
husband. 10 She must be known for good deeds, whether it is that she has cared for
children, or has been hospitable to strangers, or has washed the feet of the saints,
or has relieved the afflicted, or has been devoted to every good work. 11 But as for
younger widows, refuse to enroll them in the list. For when they give in to bodily
desires against Christ, they want to marry. 12 In this way they incur guilt because
they revoke their first commitment. 13 At the same time, they also learn to be lazy
and they go around from house to house. They not only become lazy, but they also
talk nonsense and are busybodies, saying things they should not say. 14 I therefore
want younger women to marry, to bear children, to manage the household, and to
give no opportunity for the enemy to slander us. 15 For some have already turned
aside after Satan. 16 If any believing woman has widows, let her help them, so that
the church will not be weighed down, so that it might help the real widows.
17 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially
those who work with the word and in teaching. 18 For the scripture says, “You shall
not put a muzzle on an ox while it treads the grain” and “The laborer is worthy of
his wages.” 19 Do not receive an accusation against an elder unless there are two
or three witnesses. 20 Correct sinners before all so that the rest may be afraid. 21 I
solemnly command you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to keep
these commands without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. 22 Place
hands hastily on no one. Do not share in the sins of another person. You should
keep yourself pure. 23 You should no longer drink water. Instead, you should take a
little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses. 24 The sins of some people
are openly known, and they go before them into judgment. But some sins follow
later. 25 Likewise, some good works are openly known, but even the others cannot be
hidden.
6
1 Let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy1 Timothy 6:2
1239
1 Timothy 6:21
of all honor. They should do this so that the name of God and the teaching might
not be blasphemed. 2 The slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect
them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve them all the more. For
the masters who are helped by their work are believers and are loved. Teach and
declare these things.
3 If anyone teaches something that does not agree with the reliable instruction of
our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 he is proud and understands nothing.
He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and arguments about words that result
in envy, strife, insults, evil suspicions, 5 and constant conflict between people with
depraved minds. They have lost the truth and they think that godliness is a way to
get more money. * 6 Now godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we have
brought nothing into the world. Neither are we able to take out anything. 8 Instead,
let us be satisfied with food and clothing. 9 Now those who want to become wealthy
fall into temptation, into a trap. They fall into many foolish and harmful passions,
and into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love
of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people who desire it have been mislead
away from the faith and have pierced themselves with much grief.
11 But you, man of God, flee from these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness,
faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of faith. Take
hold of the everlasting life to which you were called, and about which you gave the
good confession before many witnesses. 13 I give you this command before God, who
causes all things to live, and before Christ Jesus, who spoke what is true to Pontius
Pilate: 14 Keep the commandment without spot or blame until the appearance of our
Lord Jesus Christ. 15 God will reveal Christ's appearing at the right time—God, the
blessed and only Sovereign, the King who reigns and the Lord who rules. 16 Only he
has immortality and dwells in inapproachable light. No man sees him or is able to
view him. To him be honor and eternal power. Amen.
17 Tell the rich in this world not to be proud, and not to hope in riches, which are
uncertain. Instead, they should hope in God. He offers to us all the true riches to
enjoy. 18 Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and willing
to share. 19 In that way, they will store up for themselves a good foundation for what
is to come, so that they will take hold of real life.
20 Timothy, protect what was given to you. Avoid the foolish talk and conflicting
ideas of what is falsely called knowledge. 21 Some men proclaim these things and so
they have missed the faith. May grace be with you.
* 6:5 Some old copies add, Withdraw from such things, but the best ancient copies do not.2 Timothy 1:1
1240
2 Timothy 2:11
Second Timothy
1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise
of the life that is in Christ Jesus, 2 to Timothy, beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace
from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a clean conscience, as I
constantly remember you in my prayers night and day. 4 As I remember your tears, I
long to see you, that I may be filled with joy. 5 I have been reminded of your genuine
faith, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am
convinced that it lives in you also. 6 This is the reason I am reminding you to rekindle
the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7 For God did not
give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline. 8 So do not be ashamed
of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, Paul, his prisoner. Instead, share in
suffering for the gospel according to the power of God. 9 It is God who saved us and
called us with a holy calling. He did this, not according to our works, but according
to his own plan and grace. He gave us these things in Christ Jesus before times ever
began. 10 But now God's salvation has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior
Christ Jesus. It is Christ who put an end to death and brought life that never ends to
light through the gospel. 11 Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle,
and a teacher. * 12 For this cause I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for
I know him whom I have believed. I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which
I have entrusted to him until that day. 13 Keep the example of faithful messages that
you heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 14 The good thing
that God committed to you, guard it through the Holy Spirit, who lives in us.
15 You know this, that all who live in Asia turned away from me. In this group
are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of
Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain. 17 Instead,
when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and he found me. 18 May the Lord
grant to him to find mercy from him on that day. All the ways he helped me in
Ephesus, you know very well.
2
1 You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2 The
things you heard from me among many witnesses, entrust them to faithful people
who will be able to teach others also. 3 Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of
Christ Jesus. 4 No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life, so that he
may please his superior officer. 5 Also, if someone competes as an athlete, he is not
crowned unless he competes by the rules. 6 It is necessary that the hardworking
farmer receive his share of the crops first. 7 Think about what I am saying, for
the Lord will give you understanding in everything. 8 Remember Jesus Christ, from
David's seed, who was raised from the dead. This is according to my gospel message,
9 for which I am suffering to the point of being bound with chains as a criminal. But
the word of God is not bound. 10 Therefore I endure all things for those who are
chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal
glory. 11 This is a trustworthy saying:
“If we have died with him, we will also live with him.
* 1:11 Some older versions add, to the Gentiles .2 Timothy 2:12
1241
2 Timothy 3:16
12 If we endure, we will also reign with him.
If we deny him, he also will deny us.
13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful,
for he cannot deny himself.”
14 Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling
about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. * 15 Do your best
to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no reason to be
ashamed, who accurately teaches the word of truth. 16 Avoid profane talk, which
leads to more and more godlessness. 17 Their talk will spread like cancer. Among
them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have gone astray from the truth. They
say that the resurrection has already happened, and they destroy the faith of some.
19 However, the firm foundation of God stands. It has this inscription: “The Lord
knows those who are his” and “Everyone who names the name of the Lord must
depart from unrighteousness.” 20 In a wealthy home, there are not only containers
of gold and silver. There are also containers of wood and clay. Some of these are
for honorable use, and some for dishonorable. 21 If someone cleans himself from
dishonorable use, he is an honorable container. He is set apart, useful to the Master,
and prepared for every good work. 22 Flee youthful lusts. Pursue righteousness,
faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart. 23 But
refuse foolish and ignorant questions. You know that they give birth to arguments.
24 The Lord's servant must not quarrel. Instead he must be gentle toward all, able to
teach, and patient. 25 He must in meekness educate those who oppose him. God may
perhaps give them repentance for the knowledge of the truth. 26 They may become
sober again and leave the devil's trap, after they have been captured by him for his
will.
3
1 But know this: In the last days there will be difficult times. 2 For people will be
lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to
parents, ungrateful, and unholy. 3 They will be without natural affection, unable to
reconcile, slanderers, without self-control, violent, not lovers of good. 4 They will be
betrayers, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. 5 They
will have a shape of godliness, but they will deny its power. Turn away from these
people. 6 For some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish
women. These are women who are heaped up with sins and are led away by various
desires. 7 These women are always learning, but they are never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth. 8 In the same way that Jannes and Jambres stood against
Moses, these false teachers also stand against the truth. They are men corrupt in
mind, and with regard to the faith they are proven to be false. 9 But they will not
advance very far. For their foolishness will be obvious to all, just like that of those
men. 10 But as for you, you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith,
longsuffering, love, patience, 11 persecutions, sufferings, and what happened to me at
Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured persecutions. Out of them all, the Lord
rescued me. 12 All those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be
persecuted. 13 Evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse, leading others
and themselves astray. 14 But as for you, remain in the things that you have learned
and have firmly believed. You know from whom you have learned. 15 You know that
from childhood you have known the sacred writings. These are able to make you
wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All scripture has been inspired
* 2:14 Some versions read, Warn them before the Lord .2 Timothy 3:17
1242
2 Timothy 4:22
by God. It is profitable for doctrine, for conviction, for correction, and for training
in righteousness. 17 This is so that the man of God may be competent, equipped for
every good work.
4
1 I give this solemn command before God and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living
and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom: 2 Preach the word; be
ready when it is convenient and when it is not. Reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all
patience and teaching. 3 For the time will come when people will not endure sound
teaching. Instead, they will heap up for themselves teachers according to their own
desires, who say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their hearing
away from the truth, and they will turn aside to myths. 5 But you, be sober-minded
in all things. Suffer hardship; do the work of an evangelist; fulfill your service. 6 For I
am already being poured out. The time of my departure has come. 7 I have competed
in the good contest; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith. 8 The crown of
righteousness has been reserved for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will
give to me on that day, and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his
appearing.
9 Do your best to come to me quickly. 10 For Demas has left me. He loves this
present world and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, and Titus went
to Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you because he
is useful to me in the work. 12 Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. 13 The cloak that I left at
Troas with Carpus, bring it when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.
14 Alexander the coppersmith displayed many evil deeds against me. The Lord will
repay him according to his deeds. 15 You also should guard yourself against him,
because he greatly opposed our words. 16 At my first defense, no one stood with
me. Instead, everyone left me. May it not be counted against them. 17 But the Lord
stood by me and strengthened me so that, through me, the message might be fully
proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear it; and that I was rescued out of the
lion's mouth. 18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will save me for
his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
19 Greet Priscilla, Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. 20 Erastus remained at
Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. 21 Do your best to come before winter.
Eubulus greets you, also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
22 May the Lord be with your spirit. May grace be with you.Titus 1:1

Titus 2:14
Titus
1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen
people and the knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness, 2 with the certain
hope of everlasting life that God, who does not lie, promised before all the ages of
time. 3 At the right time, he revealed his word by the message that he trusted me to
deliver. I was to do this by the command of God our savior. 4 To Titus, a true son in
our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior.
5 For this purpose I left you in Crete, that you might set in order things not yet
complete and ordain elders in every city as I directed you. 6 An elder must be
without blame, the husband of one wife, with faithful children who do not have
the reputation of being reckless or undisciplined. 7 It is necessary for the overseer,
as God's household manager, to be blameless. He must not be arrogant, not be easily
angered, not addicted to wine, not a brawler, and not a greedy man. 8 Instead, he
should be hospitable and a friend of what is good. He must be sensible, righteous,
godly, and self-controlled. 9 He should hold tightly to the trustworthy message that
was taught, so that he may be able to encourage others with good teaching and correct
those who oppose him.
10 For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially
those of the circumcision. 11 It is necessary to stop them. They are upsetting whole
families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach. 12 One of their
own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 13 This
statement is true. Therefore, correct them severely, so that they may be sound in the
faith, 14 not paying any attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of people who
turn away from the truth. 15 To those who are pure, all things are pure. But to those
who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and their
consciences have been corrupted. 16 They profess to know God, but they deny him by
their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for doing any good work.
1 But
2
you, speak what fits with faithful instruction. 2 Teach older men to be
temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance. 3 Teach
older women likewise to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or being slaves to
much wine, but to be teachers of what is good. 4 In this way they may train the
younger women to love their own husbands and children, 5 to be sensible, pure, good
housekeepers, and obedient to their own husbands. They should do these things so
that God's word may not be insulted. 6 In the same way, encourage the younger men
to use good sense. 7 In all ways present yourself as an example of good works. In
your teaching, show integrity, dignity, 8 and a correct message, so that anyone who
opposes you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. 9 Teach
slaves to obey their masters in everything, to please them and not argue with them,
10 to not steal from them, but instead to demonstrate all good faith, so that in every
way they may bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior. 11 For the grace of
God has appeared for the salvation of all people. 12 It trains us to reject godlessness
and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this age,
13 while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope, the appearance of the glory
of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. 14 Jesus gave himself for us in order toTitus 2:15
1244
Titus 3:15
redeem us from all lawlessness and to make pure, for himself, a special people who
are eager to do good works.
15 Speak of these things, encourage people to do them, and give correction with all
authority. Let no one disregard you.
3
1 Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey them, to be ready
for every good work, 2 to revile no one, to not be eager to fight, and to be gentle,
showing all humility toward everyone. 3 For once we ourselves were thoughtless and
disobedient. We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures. We
lived in evil and envy. We were detestable and hated one another. 4 But when the
kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared, 5 it was not by works
of righteousness that we did, but by his mercy that he saved us. He saved us through
the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit. 6 God richly poured the
Holy Spirit on us through our Savior Jesus Christ, 7 so that having been justified by
his grace, we might become heirs with the certain hope of eternal life. 8 This message
is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed
in God may be careful to engage themselves in good works. These things are good
and useful for everyone. 9 But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and
conflict about the law. Those things are unprofitable and worthless. 10 Reject anyone
who is causing divisions among you, after one or two warnings, 11 knowing that such
a person has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself.
12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry and come to me at Nicopolis,
where I have decided to spend the winter. 13 Do everything you can to send on their
way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that they lack nothing. 14 Our people must
learn to engage themselves in good works that provide for urgent needs, and so not
be unfruitful.
15 All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be
with all of you.Philemon 1

4 I always thank my God. I mention you in my prayers. 5 I have heard of the love
and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and for all the believers. 6 I pray that
the fellowship of your faith may be effective for the knowledge of everything good
that is among us in Christ. 7 For I have had much joy and comfort because of your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
8 Therefore, although I have all the boldness in Christ to command you to do what
you should do, 9 yet because of love, I appeal to you instead—I, Paul, an old man, and
now a prisoner for Christ Jesus. 10 I am asking you concerning my child Onesimus,
whom I have fathered in my chains. 11 For he once was useless to you, but now he
is useful both to you and to me. 12 I have sent him back to you, he who is my very
heart. 13 I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me for you, while I
am in chains for the sake of the gospel. 14 But I did not want to do anything without
your consent. I did not want your good deed to be from necessity but from good will.
15 Perhaps for this he was separated from you for a time, so that you might have him
back forever. 16 No longer would he be a slave, but better than a slave, a beloved
brother. He is beloved especially to me, and much more so to you, in both the flesh
and in the Lord. 17 So if you have me as a partner, receive him as me. 18 If he has
wronged you or owes you anything, charge that to me. 19 I, Paul, write this with my
own hand. I myself will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your own self!
20 Yes, brother, do me a favor in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
21 Confident about your obedience, I am writing to you. I know that you will do
even more than I ask. 22 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope
that through your prayers I will be given back to you.
23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.
24 So do Mark,
Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
25 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.Hebrews 1:1

Hebrews 2:6
Hebrews
1 Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and
in many ways. 2 But in these last days, he has spoken to us through a Son, whom
he appointed to be the heir of all things. It is through him that God also made the
universe. 3 He is the brightness of God's glory, the exact representation of his being.
He even holds everything together by the word of his power. After he had made
cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 4 He has
become just as superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent
than their name. 5 For to which of the angels did God ever say,
“You are my son,
today I have become your father”?
Or to which of the angels did God ever say,
“I will be a father to him,
and he will be a son to me”?
6 But again, when God brings the firstborn into the world, he says, “All God's angels
must worship him.” 7 About the angels he says,
“He is the one who makes his angels spirits,
and his servants flames of fire.”
8 But to the Son he says,
“Your throne, God, is forever and ever.
The scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of justice.
9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.
Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
with the oil of joy more than your companions.”
10 “In the beginning, Lord, you laid the earth's foundation.
The heavens are the work of your hands.
11 They will perish, but you will continue.
They will all wear out like a piece of clothing.
12 You will roll them up like a cloak,
and they will be changed like a piece of clothing.
But you are the same,
and your years do not end.”
13 But to which of the angels has God said at any time,
“Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies a stool for your feet”?
14 Are not all angels spirits who serve, and who are sent to care for those who will
inherit salvation?
2
1 Therefore we must give far more attention to what we have heard, so that we do
not drift away from it. 2 For if the message that was spoken through the angels proved
to be so reliable, and every trespass and disobedience receives just punishment, 3 how
then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This is salvation that was first
announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it. 4 At the same time
God testified to it by signs, wonders, and various powerful deeds, and by distributing
the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his will.
5 For it was not to the angels that God subjected the world to come, about which
we are speaking. 6 Instead, someone has somewhere testified, saying,Hebrews 2:7
1247
Hebrews 3:10
“What is man, that you are mindful of him?
Or a son of man, that you care for him?
7 You made man a little lower than the angels;
you crowned him with glory and honor. *
8 You put everything in subjection under his feet.”
For it was to him that God has subjected all things. He did not leave anything not
subjected to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him. 9 But we
see him who was made lower than the angels for a little while, Jesus, crowned with
glory and honor because of his suffering and death, so that by God's grace he might
taste death for everyone. 10 For it was proper for God, because everything exists for
him and through him, to bring many sons to glory. It was proper for him to make
the leader of their salvation complete through his sufferings. 11 For both the one who
sanctifies and those who are sanctified have one source. So he is not ashamed to call
them brothers. 12 He says,
“I will proclaim your name to my brothers,
I will sing about you from inside the assembly.”
13 And again,
“I will trust in him.”
And again,
“See, here am I and the children whom God has given me.”
14 Therefore, since the children of God share flesh and blood, Jesus also shared the
same things with them, so that through death he would do away with the one who
had the power of death, that is, the devil. 15 This was so that he would free all those
who through fear of death lived all their lives in slavery. 16 For of course it is not
with angels that he is concerned; instead, it is with the seed of Abraham that he is
concerned. 17 So it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways, so
that he would be a merciful and faithful high priest in relation to the things of God,
and so that he would bring about the pardon of the people's sins. 18 Because Jesus
himself has suffered and was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
3
1 Therefore, holy brothers, you share in a heavenly calling. Think about Jesus, the
apostle and high priest of our confession. 2 He was faithful to God, who appointed
him, just as Moses was also faithful in God's house. 3 For Jesus has been considered
worthy of greater glory than Moses, because the one who builds a house has more
honor than the house itself. 4 For every house is built by someone, but the one who
built everything is God. 5 For Moses was faithful as a servant in God's entire house,
bearing witness about the things that were to be spoken of in the future. 6 But Christ
is faithful as a Son who is in charge of God's house. We are his house if we hold fast
to our courage and the hope of which we boast. 7 Therefore, it is just as the Holy
Spirit says:
“Today, if you hear his voice
8 do not harden your hearts
as in the rebellion,
in the time of testing in the wilderness.
9 This was when your ancestors rebelled by testing me,
and when, during forty years, they saw my deeds.
10 Therefore I was displeased with that generation.
I said, 'They have always gone astray in their hearts.
* 2:7 Some older version add, and you have put him over the works of your hands .Hebrews 3:11
1248
Hebrews 4:15
They have not known my ways.'
11 It is just as I swore in my anger:
'They will never enter my rest.'”
12 Be careful, brothers, so that among you there will not be anyone with an evil
heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God. 13 Instead, encourage
one another daily, as long as it is called “today,” so that no one among you will be
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 14 For we have become partners of Christ if we
firmly hold to our confidence in him from the beginning to the end. 15 About this it
has been said,
“Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts,
as in the rebellion.”
16 Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of
Egypt through Moses? 17 With whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with
those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 18 To whom did he swear
that they would not enter his rest, if it was not to those who disobeyed him? 19 We
see that they were not able to enter his rest because of unbelief.
4
1 Therefore, let us be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to
reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest. 2 For we were told the good
news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in
faith with those who obeyed. * 3 For we who have believed enter that rest, just as he
said,
“As I swore in my wrath,
They will never enter my rest.”
Even so, his works were finished from the foundation of the world. 4 For he has
somewhere spoken about the seventh day:
“And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” 5 And again in this same
passage he said,
“They will never enter my rest.”
6 Therefore, because it is still reserved for some to enter his rest, and since many
Israelites who heard the good news did not enter it because of disobedience, 7 God
has again set a certain day calling it “Today.” After many days, he spoke through
David, as it was earlier said,
“Today if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts.”
8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another
day. 9 Therefore there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people. 10 For he who
enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, just as God did from his.
11 Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the kind of
disobedience that they did. 12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper
than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the division of soul from spirit, and
joints from marrow. It is able to know the heart's thoughts and intentions. 13 Nothing
created is hidden before God. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the
one to whom we must give account.
14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,
Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our beliefs. 15 For we do not have a high
priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. Instead, we have someone who
* 4:2 Other versions read, But that message did not benefit those who heard it without joining faith to it .Hebrews 4:16
1249
Hebrews 6:12
has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin. 16 Let us then
go with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find
grace to help in time of need.
1 For every high priest,
5
chosen from among people, is appointed to act on the
behalf of people in the things concerning God, so that he may offer both gifts and
sacrifices for sins. 2 He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and who have
been deceived, because he himself is subject to weakness. 3 Because of this, he also is
required to offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the people's sins. 4 It
is not for himself that anyone takes this honor. Instead, he is called by God, just as
Aaron was. 5 In the same way, neither did Christ honor himself by making himself
high priest. Instead, the one speaking to him said,
“You are my Son;
today I have become your Father.”
6 It is just as he also says in another place,
“You are a priest forever
after the manner of Melchizedek.”
7 During the days of his flesh, Christ offered up both prayers and requests with
loud cries and tears to God, the one able to save him from death, and he was heard
because of his godly life. 8 Even though he was a son, he learned obedience from
what he suffered. 9 He was made perfect and became, for everyone who obeys him,
the cause of eternal salvation. 10 He was designated by God as high priest after the
manner of Melchizedek.
11 We have much to say about Jesus, but it is hard to explain since you have become
dull in hearing. 12 For though by this time you should be teachers, you still have
need for someone to teach you the basic principles of God's messages. You need
milk, not solid food! 13 For anyone who only takes milk is inexperienced with the
message of righteousness, because he is still a little child. 14 But solid food is for
adults. These are those who because of their maturity have their understanding
trained for distinguishing good from evil.
6
1 So then, let us leave the beginning of the message of Christ and move forward to
maturity. Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of
faith in God, 2 nor the foundation of teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, the
resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 3 We will also do this if God permits.
4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly
gift, who were sharers of the Holy Spirit, 5 and who tasted God's good word and the
powers of the age to come, 6 but who then fell away—it is impossible to restore them
again to repentance. This is because they crucify the Son of God for themselves again,
and publicly shame him. 7 For the land that drinks in the rain that often comes on it,
and that gives birth to the plants useful to those for whom the land was worked—this
is the land that receives a blessing from God. 8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is
worthless and is near to a curse. Its end is in burning.
9 But we are convinced about better things concerning you, beloved ones, things
that concern salvation, even though we speak like this. 10 For God is not so unjust that
he would forget your work and the love that you have shown for his name, because
you served the believers and still serve them. 11 We greatly desire that each of you
may show the same diligence to the end, in order to make your hope certain. 12 ThisHebrews 6:13
1250
Hebrews 7:21
is so that you will not become lazy, but imitators of those who by faith and patience
inherit the promises.
13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore by himself, since he could
not swear by anyone greater. 14 He said, “I will certainly bless you, and I will greatly
increase you.” 15 In this way, Abraham obtained what was promised after he had
patiently waited. 16 For people swear by someone greater than themselves. At the
end of each of their disputes, an oath serves as confirmation. 17 When God decided
to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable quality of his
purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath. 18 He did this so that by two unchangeable
things—with which it is impossible for God to lie—we, who have fled for refuge, will
have a strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us. 19 We have this
as a secure and reliable anchor for the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place
behind the curtain, 20 where Jesus, who went before us, has entered into that place
on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
7
1 It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham
returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. 2 It was to him that
Abraham gave a tenth of everything. His name “Melchizedek” means “king of
righteousness.” His other title is “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace.” 3 He is
without father, without mother, without ancestors, with neither beginning of days
nor end of life. Instead, he resembles the Son of God, because he remains a priest
forever.
4 See how great this man was to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the
things that he had taken in battle. 5 The sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have
a command from the law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers,
even though they, too, have come from Abraham's body. 6 But Melchizedek, whose
descent was not traced from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him,
the one who had the promises. 7 There is no denying that the lesser person is blessed
by the greater person. 8 In this case, mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is
testified that he lives on. 9 And, in a manner of speaking, Levi, who received tithes,
also paid tithes through Abraham, 10 because Levi was in the body of his ancestor
when Melchizedek met Abraham.
11 Now if perfection were possible through the Levitical priesthood (for under it
the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another
priest to arise after the manner of Melchizedek, and not be considered to be after
the manner of Aaron? 12 For when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be
changed. 13 For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe,
from which no one has ever served at the altar. 14 Now clearly, it is from Judah that
our Lord was born, a tribe that Moses never mentioned concerning priests. 15 What
we say is clearer yet if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek. 16 It was
not based on the law of fleshly descent that he became a priest, but instead was based
on the power of an everlasting life. 17 For scripture witnesses about him:
“You are a priest forever
after the manner of Melchizedek.”
18 For the former regulation is set aside because it is weak and useless, 19 (for the
law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, through which we come
near to God. 20 And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any
oath, 21 but he became a priest when God said to him,
“The Lord has sworn and he will not change his mind:Hebrews 7:22
1251
Hebrews 8:12
'You are a priest forever.'”
22 By this also Jesus has given the guarantee of a better covenant. 23 The former
priests were many in number, since death prevented them from continuing in office.
24 But because Jesus continues to live forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
25 Therefore he is also able to save completely those who approach God through him,
because he always lives to intercede for them. 26 For such a high priest is suitable
for us. He is sinless, blameless, pure, separated from sinners, and has become higher
than the heavens. 27 He does not need, unlike the high priests, to offer up daily
sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He did this once
for all, when he offered himself. 28 For the law appoints as high priests men who
have weaknesses. But the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a
Son, who has been made perfect forever.
8
1 Now the point of what we are saying is this: We have a high priest who has sat
down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens. 2 He is a servant
in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up. 3 For every high
priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary to have
something to offer. 4 Now if Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since
there are those who offer the gifts according to the law. 5 They serve in a tabernacle
that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. It is just as Moses was warned by
God when he was about to construct the tabernacle: God said, “See that you make
everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.” 6 But
now Christ has received a much better ministry, just as he is also the mediator of a
better covenant, which is based on better promises. 7 For if that first covenant had
been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant. 8 For when
God found fault with the people, he said,
“See, the days are coming—says the Lord—
when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
9 It will not be like the covenant
that I made with their ancestors
on the day that I took them by their hand
to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
For they did not carefully obey my covenant,
and I disregarded them
—says the Lord.
10 This is the covenant
that I will make with the house of Israel
after those days
—says the Lord.
I will put my laws into their minds,
and I will also write them on their hearts.
I will be their God,
and they will be my people.
11 They will not teach each one his neighbor
and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.'
For they will all know me,
from the least of them to the greatest.
12 For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds,
and their sins I will not remember any longer.”Hebrews 8:13
1252
Hebrews 9:26
13 By calling this covenant “new,” he declared the first covenant to be old, and what
has become old and obsolete will soon disappear.
9
1 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
2 For a tabernacle was prepared.
The first room, in which were the lampstand, the
table, and the bread of the presence, was called the holy place. 3 Behind the second
curtain was another room, called the most holy place. 4 It had a golden altar for
incense. It also had the ark of the covenant, which was completely overlaid with gold.
Inside it was a golden jar holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets
of the covenant. 5 Above the ark of the covenant, glorious cherubim overshadowed
the atonement lid, which we cannot now talk about in detail. 6 After these things were
prepared, the priests always entered the outer room of the tabernacle to perform
their services. 7 But only the high priest entered the second room once each year, and
not without blood that he offered for himself and for the people's unintentional sins.
8 The Holy Spirit showed that the way into the most holy place had not yet appeared
as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. 9 This was an illustration for the
present time. Both the gifts and sacrifices that are now being offered are not able to
perfect the worshiper's conscience. 10 They are only concerned with food and drink
and various ceremonial washings, regulations for the body until the time of the new
order.
11 Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come. He went through
the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands, one not
belonging to this created world. * 12 It was not by the blood of goats and calves, but
by his own blood that he entered into the most holy place once for all and secured
our eternal redemption. 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of
a heifer's ashes on those who have become unclean sets them apart to God for the
cleansing of their flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from
dead works to serve the living God? 15 For this reason, he is the mediator of a new
covenant. This is so that, since a death has taken place to free those under the first
covenant from their sins, those who are called will receive the promise of an eternal
inheritance. 16 For where there is a will, the death of the person who made it must
be proven. 17 For a will is only in force when there has been a death, because it has
no force while the one who made it is still alive. 18 So not even the first covenant was
established without blood. 19 For when Moses had given every command in the law
to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water, red wool,
and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people. 20 Then he said,
“This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.” 21 In the same
manner, he sprinkled the blood on the tabernacle and all the containers used in the
service. 22 According to the law, almost everything is cleansed with blood. Without
the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
23 Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in heaven should be
cleansed with these animal sacrifices. However, the heavenly things themselves had
to be cleansed with much better sacrifices. 24 For Christ did not enter into the most
holy place made with hands, which is only a copy of the true one. Instead he entered
into heaven itself, to appear now in God's presence for us. 25 He did not go there in
order to offer himself many times, as does the high priest, who enters the most holy
place year by year with the blood of another. 26 If that had been the case, then he
* 9:11 Other versions read, Christ came as a high priest of the good things that are to come .Hebrews 9:27
1253
Hebrews 10:25
would have had to suffer many times since the beginning of the world. But now he
has appeared at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
27 Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that comes judgment, 28 so also,
Christ was offered once to take away the sins of many, and will appear a second time,
not to deal with sin, but for the salvation of those who are waiting for him.
10
1 For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the real forms of
those things themselves. Those who approach God can never be made perfect by the
same sacrifices that the priests continually bring year after year. 2 Otherwise, would
the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers would have been
cleansed one time and would no longer have any consciousness of sin. 3 But with
those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. 4 For it is impossible for
the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 5 When Christ came into the world, he
said,
“Sacrifices and offerings
you did not desire,
but a body you have prepared for me;
6 with burnt offerings and sin offerings
you did not take pleasure.
7 Then I said, 'See, here I am—
as it is written about me in the scroll—
to do your will.'”
8 First he said, “It was neither sacrifices, nor offerings, nor whole burnt offerings,
nor sacrifices for sin that you desired. Nor did you take pleasure in them.” These
are sacrifices that are offered according to the law. 9 Then he said, “See, here I am
to do your will.” He takes away the first practice in order to establish the second
practice. 10 By that will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all. 11 Day after day every priest stands and performs his service
to God. He offers the same sacrifices again and again—sacrifices that can never take
away sins. 12 But when Christ offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down
at the right hand of God. 13 He is waiting until his enemies are made a stool for his
feet. 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
15 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us. First he said,
16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them
after those days, says the Lord.
I will put my laws in their hearts,
and I will write them on their minds.
17 Their sins and lawless deeds
I will remember no longer.”
18 Now where there is forgiveness for these, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.
19 Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the
blood of Jesus. 20 That is the new and living way that he has opened for us through the
curtain, that is, by means of his flesh. 21 Because we have a great priest over the house
of God, 22 let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having our
hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with
pure water. 23 Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our hope without wavering,
because God, who has promised, is faithful. 24 Let us consider how to motivate one
another to love and good deeds. 25 Let us not stop meeting together, as some have
done. Instead, encourage one another more and more, and all the more as you see
the day coming closer.Hebrews 10:26
1254
Hebrews 11:11
26 For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of
the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists. 27 Instead, there is only a certain
fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume God's enemies.
28 Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of
two or three witnesses. 29 How much worse punishment do you think one deserves
who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, who treated the blood of the covenant
as unholy—the blood by which he was sanctified—and insulted the Spirit of grace?
30 For we know the one who said, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay back.” And
again, “The Lord will judge his people.” 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
of the living God!
32 But remember the former days, after you were enlightened, how you endured a
great struggle in suffering. 33 You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and
persecution, and you were sharing with those who went through such suffering.
34 For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with
joy the seizure of your possessions. You knew that you yourselves had a better and
everlasting possession. * 35 So do not throw away your confidence, which has a great
reward. 36 For you need patience, so that you may receive what God has promised,
after you have done his will.
37 “For in a very little while,
the one who is coming will indeed come and not delay.
38 My righteous one will live by faith.
If he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him.”
39 But we are not any of those who turn back to destruction. Instead, we are some
of those who have faith for keeping our soul.
11
1 Now faith is being sure of the things hoped for and certain of things that are not
seen. 2 For because of this the ancestors were approved for their faith. 3 By faith we
understand that the universe was created by God's command, so that what is visible
was not made out of things that were visible. 4 It was by faith that Abel offered God
a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was attested to be righteous, and God
spoke well of him because of his offerings, and by faith Abel still speaks, even though
he is dead. 5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death. “He
was not found, because God took him.” For before he was taken up, it was testified
that he had pleased God. 6 Now without faith it is impossible to please him. For it
is necessary that anyone coming to God must believe that he exists and that he is a
rewarder of those who seek him. 7 It was by faith that Noah, having been given a
divine message about things not yet seen, with godly reverence built a ship to save
his household. By doing this, he condemned the world and became an heir of the
righteousness that is according to faith. 8 It was by faith that Abraham, when he was
called, obeyed and went out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance.
He went out, not knowing where he was going. 9 It was by faith that he lived in the
land of promise as a foreigner. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs
of the same promise. 10 For he was looking forward to the city with foundations,
whose architect and builder is God. 11 It was by faith, even though Sarah herself was
barren, that Abraham received ability to father a child. This happened even though
* 10:34 Some older versions read, For you had compassion on me in my chains .Hebrews 11:12
1255
Hebrews 11:39
he was too old, since he considered as faithful the one who had given the promise. *
12 Therefore, from this one man—and he was almost dead—were born descendants as
many as the stars in the sky and as countless as sand by the seashore. 13 It was in faith
that all these died without receiving the promises. Instead, after seeing and greeting
them from far off, they admitted that they were foreigners and exiles on earth. 14 For
those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 15 If they
had been thinking of the country from which they had gone out, they would have had
opportunity to return. 16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly
one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, since he has prepared a
city for them. 17 It was by faith that Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac.
It was his only son whom he offered, he who had received the promises. 18 It was
Abraham to whom it had been said, “It is through Isaac that your descendants will
be named.” 19 Abraham reasoned that God was able to raise up Isaac from the dead,
and figuratively speaking, it was from them that he received him back. 20 It was also
by faith about things to come that Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau. 21 It was by faith that
Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons. Jacob worshiped, leaning on
the top of his staff. 22 It was by faith that Joseph, when his end was near, spoke of the
departure of the children of Israel from Egypt and instructed them about his bones.
23 It was by faith that Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his
parents because they saw he was a beautiful child. They were not afraid of the king's
command. 24 It was by faith that Moses, after he had grown up, refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh's daughter. 25 Instead, he chose to suffer with the people of God,
rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a while. 26 He reasoned that the disgrace
of following Christ was greater riches than Egypt's treasures. For he was fixing his
eyes on his reward. 27 It was by faith that Moses left Egypt. He did not fear the king's
anger, for he endured as if he were seeing the one who is invisible. 28 It was by faith
that he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of
the firstborn should not touch the Israelites' firstborn sons. 29 It was by faith that
they passed through the Sea of Reeds as if over dry land. When the Egyptians tried
to do this, they were swallowed up. 30 It was by faith that Jericho's walls fell down,
after they had been circled around for seven days. 31 It was by faith that Rahab the
prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had received
the spies in peace. 32 What more can I say? For the time will fail me if I tell about
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and about the prophets. 33 It was
through faith that they conquered kingdoms, worked justice, and received promises.
They stopped the mouths of lions, 34 extinguished the power of fire, escaped the edge
of the sword, were healed of illnesses, became mighty in battle, and defeated foreign
armies. 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured,
not accepting release, so that they might experience a better resurrection. 36 Others
had testing in mocking and whippings, and even chains and imprisonment. 37 They
were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were killed with the sword. They went
about in sheepskins and goatskins. They were destitute, oppressed, mistreated. †
38 The world was not worthy of them. They were always wandering about in the
deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. 39 Although all these
people were approved by God because of their faith, they did not receive the promise.
* 11:11 There is some question about whether it was Abraham's faith or Sarah's faith that was in view. By faith
Sarah, though she was old, received the power to have a child, even though she was too old to bear a child, since
† 11:37 Some older versions read, They were
she considered the one who gave the promise to be faithful .
stoned. They were sawn in two. They were put to the test. They were killed with the sword .Hebrews 11:40
1256
Hebrews 12:26
40 God planned something better for us, so that without us, they would not be made
perfect.
12
1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a large cloud of witnesses, let us lay
aside every weight and easily entangling sin. Let us patiently run the race that is
placed before us. 2 Let us pay attention to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of the
faith. For the joy that was placed before him, he endured the cross, despised its
shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 So think about him,
the one who has endured such opposition from sinners against himself, so that you
do not become weary in your hearts and give up.
4 You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin to the point of blood; 5 and you
have forgotten the encouragement that instructs you as sons:
“My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline,
nor grow weary when you are corrected by him.”
6 For the Lord disciplines everyone whom he loves,
and he punishes every son whom he receives.
7 Endure suffering as discipline. God deals with you as with sons. For what son is
there whom his father does not discipline? 8 But if you are without discipline, which
all people share in, then you are illegitimate and not his sons. 9 Furthermore, we had
human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. How much more should
we submit to the Father of spirits and live! 10 Our fathers disciplined us for a short
time as they thought best. But God disciplines us for our good, so that we can share
in his holiness. 11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. But later it
produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who have been trained by it.
12 So strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees. 13 Make straight
paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be sprained but rather be healed.
14 Pursue peace with everyone, and also the holiness without which no one will see
the Lord. 15 Be careful so that no one lacks God's grace, and that no root of bitterness
grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it. 16 Be careful
that there be no sexually immoral or ungodly person such as Esau, who for one meal
sold his own birthright. 17 For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit
the blessing, he was rejected, because he found no opportunity for repentance, even
though he sought it with tears.
18 For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, a mountain of burning
fire, darkness, gloom, and storm. 19 You have not come to a trumpet blast, nor to a
voice that speaks words whose hearers begged that not another word be spoken to
them. 20 For they could not endure what was commanded: “If even an animal touches
the mountain, it must be stoned.” * 21 So fearful was this sight that Moses said, “I
am terrified and am trembling.” 22 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion and to the
city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels in
celebration. 23 You have come to the congregation of the firstborn, who have been
registered in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the
righteous ones who have been made perfect. 24 You have come to Jesus, the mediator
of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood.
25 See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking. For if they did not escape when
they refused the one who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we turn
away from the one who is warning from heaven. 26 At one time, his voice shook the
* 12:20 Some older versions read, If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an
arrow .Hebrews 12:27
1257
Hebrews 13:25
earth. But now he has promised and said, “One more time I will shake not only the
earth, but also the heavens.” 27 These words, “One more time,” mean the removal of
those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things that have been created, so that
the things that cannot be shaken will remain. 28 Therefore, receiving a kingdom that
cannot be shaken, let us be grateful and in this manner worship God with reverence
and awe. 29 For our God is a consuming fire.
1 Let
13
brotherly love continue. 2 Do not forget hospitality for strangers. For
through this, some have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. 3 Remember
prisoners, as if you were bound with them. Remember those who are mistreated, as
if you also were them in the body. 4 Let marriage be respected by everyone. Let the
marriage bed be pure, for God will judge the sexually immoral people and adulterers.
5 Let your conduct be free from the love of money. Be content with the things you
have, for God himself has said, “I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you.” 6 Let
us be content so that we may have courage to say,
“The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
What can a man do to me?”
7 Consider your leaders, those who spoke God's word to you, and consider the result
of their conduct. Imitate their faith. 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
forever. 9 Do not be carried away by various strange teachings. For it is good that
the heart should be strengthened by grace, not by foods that do not help those who
walk by them. 10 We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle
have no right to eat. 11 For the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the
high priest into the holy place, while their bodies are burned outside the camp. 12 So
Jesus also suffered outside the city gate, in order to sanctify the people through his
own blood. 13 Let us therefore go to him outside the camp, bearing his shame. 14 For
we do not have any permanent city here. Instead, we are looking for one that is to
come. 15 Through him, then, let us always offer up sacrifices of praise to God, praise
that is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. 16 Let us not forget doing good and
helping one another, for it is with such sacrifices that God is very pleased. 17 Obey
and submit to your leaders, for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will
give account. Obey so that your leaders will do this with joy, and not with groaning,
which would be useless to you.
18 Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a clean conscience and that we
desire to live rightly in all things. 19 I encourage you even more to do this, so that I
will be returned to you sooner.
20 Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead the great shepherd
of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, by the blood of the eternal covenant, 21 equip you with
everything good to do his will, working in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus
Christ, to whom be the glory forever. Amen.
22 Now I encourage you, brothers, to bear with the word of encouragement that I
have briefly written to you. 23 Know that our brother Timothy has been set free, with
whom I will see you if he comes soon.
24 Greet all your leaders and all the believers. Those from Italy greet you.
25 May grace be with you all.James 1:1
1258
James 2:6
James
1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in
the dispersion: Greetings! 2 Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you experience
various troubles. 3 You know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 4 Let
endurance complete its work, so that you may become fully developed and complete,
not lacking anything. 5 But if any of you needs wisdom, let him ask for it from God,
the one who gives generously and without rebuke to all who ask, and he will give it
to him. 6 But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For anyone who doubts is like
a wave in the sea that is driven by the wind and tossed around. 7 For that person
must not think that he will receive anything from the Lord. 8 Such a person is double-
minded, unstable in all his ways. 9 Let the poor brother boast of his high position,
10 but the rich man of his low position, because he will pass away as a wild flower in
the grass. 11 For the sun rises with burning heat and dries up the grass. The flower
falls off, and its beauty perishes. In the same way, the rich man will fade away in
the middle of his journey. 12 Blessed is the man who endures testing. For after he
has passed the test, he will receive the crown of life, which has been promised to
those who love God. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,”
because God is not tempted by evil, nor does he himself tempt anyone. 14 But each
person is tempted by his own desire, which drags him away and entices him. 15 Then
after the desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and after the sin is full grown, it gives
birth to death. 16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and
every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights. With him
there is no changing or shadow because of turning. 18 God chose to give us birth by
the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all the things that he
created. 19 You know this, my beloved brothers: Let every man be quick to hear, slow
to speak, and slow to anger. 20 For the anger of man does not work the righteousness
of God. 21 Therefore take off all sinful filth and abundant amounts of evil. In humility
receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 22 Be doers of the word
and not only hearers, deceiving yourselves. 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word
but not a doer, he is like a man who examines his natural face in a mirror. 24 He
examines himself and then goes away and immediately forgets what he was like.
25 But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law of freedom, and continues
to do so, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed in his actions.
26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but if he does not control his tongue, he
deceives his heart, and his religion is worthless. 27 Religion that is pure and unspoiled
before our God and Father is to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and
to keep oneself unstained by the world.
2
1 My brothers, do not hold to faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory,
with favoritism toward certain people. 2 Suppose that someone enters your meeting
wearing gold rings and fine clothes, and there also enters a poor man in dirty clothes.
3 If you look at the person wearing fine clothes and say, “You sit here in a good place,”
but you say to the poor man, “You stand over there” or “Sit at my feet,” 4 are you not
judging among yourselves? Have you not become judges with evil thoughts? 5 Listen,
my beloved brothers, did not God choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith
and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? 6 But youJames 2:7
1259
James 3:12
have dishonored the poor! Is it not the rich who oppress you? Are they not the ones
who drag you to court? 7 Do they not insult the good name by which you have been
called? 8 If, however, you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall
love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well. 9 But if you favor certain people, you
are committing sin, and you are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. 10 For whoever
obeys the whole law, except that he stumbles in just a single way, has become guilty
of breaking the whole law. 11 For the one who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also
said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery, but if you do commit murder,
you have become a lawbreaker. 12 So speak and act as those who will be judged by
means of the law of freedom. 13 For judgment comes without mercy to those who
have shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works?
Can that faith save him? 15 Suppose that a brother or sister is badly clothed and lacks
food for the day. 16 Suppose that one of you says to them, “Go in peace, stay warm
and be filled.” If you do not give them the things necessary for the body, what good
is that? 17 In the same way faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. 18 Yet
someone may say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without
works, and I will show you my faith by my works. 19 You believe that there is one
God; you do well. But even the demons believe that, and they tremble. 20 Do you want
to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless? * 21 Was not Abraham our
father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 22 You see
that faith worked with his works, and that by works his faith was fully developed.
23 The scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted
to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God. 24 You see that it is by
works that a man is justified, and not only by faith. 25 In the same way also, was not
Rahab the prostitute justified by works, when she welcomed the messengers and sent
them away by another road? 26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so
faith apart from works is dead.
3
1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who
teach will be judged more strictly. 2 For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does
not stumble in words, he is a perfect man, able to control even his whole body. 3 Now
if we put bits into horses' mouths for them to obey us, we can also direct their whole
bodies. 4 Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong
winds, are steered by a very small rudder to wherever the pilot desires. 5 Likewise
the tongue is a small body part, yet it boasts great things. Notice also how small a
fire sets on fire a large forest. 6 The tongue is also a fire, a world of sinfulness set
among our body parts. It stains the whole body and sets on fire the course of life.
It is itself set on fire by hell. 7 For every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea
creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 8 But no human being can
tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 9 With it we praise the Lord
and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness. 10 Out
of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things should not
happen. 11 Does a spring pour out from its opening both sweet and bitter water?
12 Does a fig tree, my brothers, make olives? Or a grapevine, figs? Neither can salty
water produce sweet water.
* 2:20 Some older versions read, Do you want to know, foolish man, how it is that faith without works is dead?James 3:13
1260
James 5:9
13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let that person show a good life by
his works in the humility of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy and ambition
in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth. 15 This is not the wisdom that
comes down from above. Instead, it is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where
there are jealousy and ambition, there is confusion and every evil practice. 17 But the
wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy
and good fruits, impartial and sincere. 18 The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace
among those who make peace.
4
1 Where do quarrels and disputes among you come from? Do they not come from
your desires that fight among your members? 2 You desire, and you do not have. You
kill and covet, and you are not able to obtain. You fight and quarrel. You do not
possess because you do not ask. 3 You ask and do not receive because you ask badly,
in order that you may use it for your desires. 4 You adulteresses! Do you not know
that friendship with the world is hostility against God? So whoever wants to be a
friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 5 Or do you think the scripture
says in vain, “The Spirit he caused to live in us is deeply jealous”? 6 But God gives
more grace, so the scripture says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the
humble.” 7 So submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Come close
to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify
your hearts, you double-minded. 9 Grieve, mourn, and cry! Let your laughter turn
into sadness and your joy into gloom. 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he
will lift you up.
11 Do not speak against one another, brothers. The person who speaks against a
brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. If you judge
the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. 12 Only one is the lawgiver and
judge. He is the one who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you, you who judge
your neighbor?
13 Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, spend a
year there, trade, and make a profit.” 14 Who knows what will happen tomorrow,
and what is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then
disappears. 15 Instead, you should say, “If the Lord wishes, we will live and do this
or that.” 16 But now you are boasting about your arrogant plans. All such boasting is
evil. 17 So for anyone who knows to do good but does not do it, for him it is sin.
5
1 Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail because of the miseries coming on
you. 2 Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten. 3 Your
gold and your silver have become tarnished and their rust will be a witness against
you. It will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure for
the last days. 4 Look, the pay of the laborers is crying out—the pay that you have
withheld from those who harvested your fields, and the cries of the harvesters have
gone into the ears of the Lord of hosts. 5 You have lived in luxury on the earth and
indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter. 6 You have
condemned and killed the righteous person. He does not resist you.
7 So be patient, brothers, until the Lord's coming. See, the farmer awaits the
valuable harvest from the ground. He is patiently waiting for it, until it receives
the early and late rains. 8 You, too, be patient. Make your hearts strong, because
the Lord's coming is near. 9 Do not complain, brothers, against one another, so thatJames 5:10
1261
James 5:20
you will be not judged. See, the judge is standing at the door. 10 Take an example,
brothers, from the suffering and patience of the prophets, those who spoke in the
name of the Lord. 11 See, we regard those who endured as blessed. You have heard
of the endurance of Job, and you know the purpose of the Lord, how he is very
compassionate and merciful.
12 Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by the earth, or by any
other oath. Instead, let your “Yes” mean “Yes” and your “No” mean “No,” so you do
not fall under judgment.
13 Is anyone among you suffering hardship? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful?
Let him sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the
church, and let them pray over him. Let them anoint him with oil in the name of the
Lord. 15 The prayer of faith will heal the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up.
If he has committed sins, God will forgive him. 16 So confess your sins to one another,
and pray for each other, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person
is very strong in its working. 17 Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly
that it would not rain, and it did not rain in the land for three years and six months.
18 Then Elijah prayed again. The heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.
19 My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone brings
him back, 20 that person should know that whoever turns a sinner from his wandering
way will save him from death, and will cover over a great number of sins.1 Peter 1:1
1262
1 Peter 1:25
First Peter
1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the foreigners of the dispersion, the chosen
ones, throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. 2 This is according
to the foreknowledge of God the Father, set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for
the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace be to you, and may your peace
increase.
3 May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be praised! In his great mercy, he
has given us new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
the dead. 4 This is for an inheritance that will not perish, will not become stained,
and will not fade away. It is reserved in heaven for you. 5 You are protected by God's
power through faith, for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last times.
6 You are very glad about this, even though it is now necessary for you to feel sadness
in many different troubles. 7 This is for the proving of your faith, which is more
precious than gold that perishes, even though it is tested by fire. This happens so that
your faith will be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revealing of Jesus
Christ. 8 You have not seen him, but you love him. You do not see him now, but you
believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory. 9 You
are now receiving for yourselves the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
10 The prophets searched and inquired carefully about this salvation, about the grace
that would be yours. 11 They searched to know about whom and when the Spirit of
Christ in them was speaking to them. This was happening as he was telling them in
advance about the sufferings of Christ and the glorious things after that. 12 It was
revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, when they spoke of
the things that have now been told to you by those who preached the gospel to you
by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.
13 So gird up the loins of your mind. Be sober. Put your hope fully on the grace
that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed. 14 As obedient children,
do not conform yourselves to the desires that you followed when you were ignorant.
15 But as the one who called you is holy, you, too, be holy in your whole behavior.
16 For it is written, “Be holy, because I am holy.” 17 So if you call “Father” the one
who judges impartially and according to each person's work, go through the time of
your journey in reverence. 18 You know that it was not with perishable silver or gold
that you have been redeemed from the foolish behavior that you learned from your
fathers. 19 Instead, you have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, who
was like a lamb without blemish or spot. 20 Christ was chosen before the foundation
of the world, but now he has been revealed to you in these last times. 21 Through
him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that
your faith and hope would be in God. 22 You made your souls pure by obedience to
the truth. This was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love; so love one another
earnestly from the heart. * 23 You have been born again, not from perishable seed,
but from imperishable seed, through the living and remaining word of God. 24 For,
“All flesh is like grass,
and all its glory is like the wild flower of the grass.
The grass dries up, and the flower falls off,
25 but the word of the Lord remains forever.”
* 1:22 Some older versions read, You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth through the Spirit .1 Peter 2:1
1263
1 Peter 2:25
This is the good news that was announced to you.
1 Therefore put aside all evil,
2
all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander. 2 As
newborn infants, long for pure spiritual milk, so that through it you may grow in
salvation, 3 if you have tasted that the Lord is kind. 4 Come to him who is a living
stone that has been rejected by people, but that has been chosen by God as valuable
to him. 5 You also are like living stones that are being built up to be a spiritual house,
in order to be a holy priesthood that offers the spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ. 6 Scripture contains this:
“See, I am laying in Zion a cornerstone,
chosen and valuable.
Whoever believes in him will not be ashamed.”
7 The honor then is for you who believe. But,
“the stone that was rejected by the builders,
this has become the head of the corner”—
8 and,
“A stone of stumbling
and a rock that makes them fall.”
They stumble because they disobey the word—which is what they were appointed
to do. 9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for
God's possession, so that you would announce the wonderful actions of the one who
called you out from darkness into his marvelous light.
10 Once you were not a people,
but now you are the people of God.
You did not receive mercy,
but now you have received mercy.
11 Beloved, I call on you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from fleshly desires,
which make war against your soul. 12 You should have good behavior among the
Gentiles, so that, if they speak about you as having done evil things, they may observe
your good works and praise God on the day of his coming.
13 Obey every human authority for the Lord's sake. Obey both the king as supreme,
14 and also the governors, who are sent to punish evildoers and to praise those who do
good. 15 For this is God's will, that in doing good you silence the ignorant talk of foolish
people. 16 As free people, do not use your freedom as a covering for wickedness, but
be like servants of God. 17 Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor
the king.
18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect. Be subject not only to the
good and gentle masters, but also to the malicious ones. 19 For it is praiseworthy if
anyone endures pain while suffering injustice because of his awareness of God. 20 For
how much credit is there if you sin and then endure while being punished? But if you
have done good and then you suffer while being punished, this is worthy of praise
from God. 21 For it is to this that you were called, because Christ also suffered for
you. He left an example for you to follow in his steps.
22 “He committed no sin,
neither was any deceit found in his mouth.”
23 When he was reviled, he did not revile back. When he suffered, he did not threaten
back, but he gave himself to the one who judges justly. 24 He himself carried our sins
in his body to the tree, so that we would have no more part in sin, and so that we
would live for righteousness. By his bruises you have been healed. 25 All of you had1 Peter 3:1
1264
1 Peter 4:3
been wandering away like lost sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd
and guardian of your souls.

1 In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands. Do this so
even if some men are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word,
through their wives' behavior. 2 For they will have seen your sincere behavior with
respect. 3 Let it be done not with outward ornaments such as braided hair, jewels of
gold, or fashionable clothing. 4 Instead, let it be done with the inner person of the
heart, and the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious before
God. 5 For this is how holy women long ago who hoped in God adorned themselves,
by submitting to their husbands. 6 In this way Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him
her lord. You are now her children if you do what is good and if you are not afraid
of trouble.
7 In the same way, you husbands should live with your wives according to
understanding, as with a weaker container, a woman. You should give them honor
as fellow heirs of the grace of life. Do this so that your prayers will not be hindered.
8 Finally, all of you, be likeminded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tender-
hearted, and humble. 9 Do not pay back evil for evil or insult for insult. On the
contrary, continue to bless, because for this you were called, that you might inherit
a blessing.
10 “The one who wants to love life and see good days
should stop his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.
11 Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good.
Let him seek peace and pursue it.
12 The eyes of the Lord see the righteous, and his ears hear their requests.
But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
13 Who is the one who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good? 14 But if
you suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear. Do
not be troubled. 15 Instead, set apart the Lord Christ in your hearts as holy. Always
be ready to answer everyone who asks you why you have confidence in God. Do this
with meekness and respect. 16 Have a good conscience so that the people who insult
your good life in Christ may be ashamed because they are speaking against you as if
you were evildoers. 17 It is better, if God desires, that you suffer for doing good than
for doing evil. 18 Christ also suffered once for sins. He who is righteous suffered for
us, who were unrighteous, so that he would bring us to God. He was put to death in
the flesh, but he was made alive by the Spirit. 19 By the Spirit, he went and preached
to the spirits who are now in prison. 20 They were disobedient when the patience
of God was waiting in the days of Noah, in the days of the building of an ark, and
God saved a few people—eight souls—by means of the water. 21 This is a symbol of
the baptism that saves you now—not as a washing away of dirt from the body, but
as the appeal of a good conscience to God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
22 Christ is at the right hand of God. He went into heaven. Angels, authorities, and
powers must submit to him.
4
1 Therefore, because Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same
intention. For whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin. 2 As a result,
such a person, for the rest of his time in the flesh, no longer lives for men's desires,
but for God's will. 3 You have spent enough time doing what the Gentiles want to do,1 Peter 4:4
1265
1 Peter 5:13
living in sensuality, passion, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, having wild parties,
and committing disgusting acts of idolatry. 4 They think it is strange that you do not
join with them in these floods of reckless behavior, so they speak evil about you.
5 They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
6 For this purpose the gospel was preached also to the dead, so that, although they
have been judged in the flesh as humans, they may live in the spirit the way God
does.
7 The end of all things is coming near. Therefore be of sound mind, and be sober
in your thinking for the sake of prayers. 8 Above all things, have fervent love for one
another, for love covers a multitude of sins. 9 Be hospitable to one another without
complaining. 10 As each one of you has received a gift, use it to serve one another,
faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. 11 If anyone speaks, let it
be with God's words. If anyone serves, let it be from the strength that God supplies.
Do these things so that in all ways God would be glorified through Jesus Christ. May
there be to Jesus Christ glory and power forever and ever. Amen.
12 Beloved, do not regard as strange the testing in the fire that has happened to
you, as if something strange were happening to you. 13 Instead, however much you
experience the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that you may also rejoice and be glad
at the revealing of his glory. 14 If you are insulted for Christ's name, you are blessed,
because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God is resting on you. 15 But let none of
you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or a meddler. 16 But if anyone suffers
as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; instead, let him glorify God with that name.
17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins with us,
what will be the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel?
18 And “If it is difficult for the righteous to be saved,
what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”
19 Therefore let those who suffer because of God's will entrust their souls to the
faithful Creator in well-doing.

1 I am exhorting the elders among you, I, who am a fellow elder and a witness
of the sufferings of Christ, and am also one who will share in the glory that will be
revealed: 2 Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers—
not because you must, but because you are willing, as God would have you serve—not
for shameful profit but eagerly. 3 Do not act as a master over the people who are in
your care. Instead, be an example to the flock. 4 Then when the Chief Shepherd is
revealed, you will receive an unfading crown of glory. 5 In the same way, you younger
men, submit to the older men. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility and serve
one another. For God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble. 6 Therefore
humble yourselves under God's mighty hand so that he may lift you up in due time.
7 Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. 8 Be sober, be watchful. Your
adversary, the devil, is stalking around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to
devour. 9 Stand against him. Be strong in your faith. You know that your community
of believers that is in the world is enduring the same sufferings. 10 After you suffer
for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will
perfect you, establish you, and strengthen you. 11 To him be the dominion forever
and ever. Amen.
12 I regard Silvanus as a faithful brother, and I have written to you briefly through
him. I am exhorting you and I am testifying to you that what I have written is the true
grace of God. Stand in it. 13 The woman who is in Babylon, who is chosen together1 Peter 5:14
1266
1 Peter 5:14
with you, greets you. Also Mark, my son, greets you. 14 Greet one another with a kiss
of love.
May peace be to you all who are in Christ.2 Peter 1:1
1267
2 Peter 2:5
Second Peter
1 Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received the
same precious faith as we have received, faith in the righteousness of our God and
Savior Jesus Christ. 2 May grace and peace increase in measure in the knowledge
of God and of Jesus our Lord. 3 All the things concerning divine power for life
and godliness have been given to us through the knowledge of God, who called us
through his own glory and excellence. 4 Through these, he gave us precious and
great promises, so that you might be sharers in the divine nature, having escaped the
corruption in the world that is caused by evil desires. 5 For this reason, do your best
to add goodness to your faith; and to goodness add knowledge; 6 to knowledge add
self-control; to self-control add endurance; to endurance add godliness; 7 to godliness
add brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection add love. 8 If these things are in
you and grow in you, you will not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ. 9 But whoever lacks these things is so nearsighted that he is blind,
having forgotten he has been cleansed from his past sins. 10 Therefore, brothers, do
your best to make your calling and election sure, for if you do these things, you will
not stumble. 11 In this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the
eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
12 Therefore I will always be ready to remind you of these things, although you
know them, and although you are strong in the truth you now have. 13 It is proper
for me to think, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by way of reminder. 14 For
I know that the putting off of my tent will be soon, because our Lord Jesus Christ
has revealed this to me. 15 I will make every effort to see that after my departure
you may be always able to remember these things. 16 For we did not follow cleverly
invented myths when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 17 For he received honor and
glory from God the Father when a voice was brought to him by the Majestic Glory
saying, “This is my beloved Son, with him I am well pleased.” 18 We ourselves heard
this voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. 19 For
we have this prophetic word made more sure, and you do well to pay attention to
it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star
rises in your hearts. 20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy comes from
someone's own interpretation. 21 For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of
man, but men spoke from God when they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
2
1 False prophets came to the people, and false teachers will also come to you. They
will secretly bring with them destructive heresies, and they will deny the master
who bought them. They are bringing quick destruction upon themselves. 2 Many
will follow their sensuality, and through them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
3 In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. For a long time their
condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction is not asleep. 4 For God did
not spare the angels who sinned. Instead he handed them down to Tartarus to be kept
in chains of lower darkness until the judgment. * 5 Also, he did not spare the ancient
world. Instead, he preserved Noah, who was a herald of righteousness, along with
* 2:4 Some other versions read, to be kept in pits of lower darkness until the judgment .2 Peter 2:6
1268
2 Peter 3:9
seven others, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly. 6 God also reduced
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to destruction, as
an example of what is to happen to the ungodly. 7 But as for the righteous Lot, he was
oppressed by the sensual behavior of lawless people. 8 So that righteous man, who
was living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul because
of what he saw and heard. 9 The Lord knows how to rescue godly men out of trials,
and how to hold unrighteous men for punishment at the day of judgment. 10 This is
especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and who
despise authority. Bold and self-willed, they are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious
ones. 11 Angels have greater strength and power, but they do not bring insulting
judgments against them to the Lord. 12 But these unreasoning animals are naturally
made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will
be destroyed. 13 They will receive the reward of their wrongdoing. They think that
luxury during the day is a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their
deceitful actions while they are feasting with you. † 14 They have eyes full of adultery,
they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and
they have their hearts trained in covetousness. They are cursed children! 15 They
have abandoned the right way and have wandered off to follow the way of Balaam
son of Beor, who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness. ‡ 16 But he obtained a
rebuke for his own transgression—a mute donkey speaking in a human voice stopped
the prophet's insanity. 17 These men are springs without water and mists driven by
a storm. The gloom of thick darkness is reserved for them. 18 They speak with vain
arrogance. They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. They entice people who
try to escape from those who live in error. 19 They promise freedom to them, but they
themselves are slaves of corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes
him. 20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world through the knowledge of
the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in them and overcome, the
last state has become worse for them than the first. 21 It would have been better
for them not to know the way of righteousness than to know it and turn away from
the holy commandment delivered to them. 22 This proverb is true for them: “A dog
returns to its own vomit, and a washed pig returns to the mud.”
3
1 Beloved, this is now the second letter that I have written to you; and in both
of them they are reminders to stir up your sincere mind, 2 so that you will recall
the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command of our Lord
and Savior given through your apostles. 3 Know this first, that mockers will come in
the last days. They will mock and proceed according to their own desires. 4 They
will say, “Where is the promise of his return? From when our fathers fell asleep,
all things have stayed the same, since the beginning of creation.” 5 They willfully
forget that the heavens and the earth came to exist out of water and through water,
long ago, by God's command, 6 and that through these things, the world of that time
was destroyed, being flooded with water. 7 But now the heavens and the earth are
reserved for fire by that same command. They are reserved for the day of judgment
and the destruction of the ungodly people.
8 It should not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a
thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. 9 The Lord does not move
slowly concerning his promises, as some consider slowness to be. Instead, he is
† 2:13 Other versions read, They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts .
Some other versions read, Balaam, son of Bosor
‡ 2:152 Peter 3:10
1269
2 Peter 3:18
patient toward you. He does not desire for any of you to perish, but for everyone
to make room for repentance. 10 However, the day of the Lord will come as a thief:
The heavens will pass away with a loud noise. The elements will be burned with fire,
and the earth and the deeds in it will be revealed. * 11 Since all these things will be
destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? You should live holy and
godly lives. 12 You should expect and hasten the coming of the day of God. On that
day, the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will be melted in great
heat. 13 But according to his promise, we are waiting for the new heavens and the
new earth, where righteousness will dwell.
14 Therefore, beloved, since you expect these things, do your best to be found
spotless and blameless before him, in peace. 15 Also, consider the patience of our Lord
to be salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom
that was given to him. 16 Paul speaks of these things in all his letters, in which there
are things that are difficult to understand. Ignorant and unstable men distort these
things, as they also do the other scriptures, to their own destruction. 17 Therefore,
beloved, since you know about these things beforehand, guard yourselves so that you
are not led astray by the deceit of lawless people and you lose your own faithfulness.
18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May the
glory be to him both now and forever. Amen!

First John
1 That which was from the beginning—which we have heard, which we have seen
with our eyes, which we have looked at, and our hands have touched—it is about
the Word of life. 2 Also, the life was made known, and we have seen it, and we bear
witness to it. We are announcing to you the eternal life, which was with the Father,
and which has been made known to us. 3 That which we have seen and heard we
declare also to you, so you also will have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with
the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 Also, we are writing these things to you
so that our joy will be complete. *
5 This is the message that we have heard from him and are announcing to you: God
is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship
with him and walk in darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth. 7 But
if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and
the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from every sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin,
we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 But if we confess our sins,
he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar, and his word is
not in us.
2
1 Children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone
sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the one who is righteous. 2 He
is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
3 We know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 The one
who says, “I know God,” but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth
is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly, in him truly the love of God has
been perfected. By this we know that we are in him: 6 whoever says that he remains
in God should himself also walk just as he walked.
7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment
that you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you
heard. 8 Yet I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Christ and
in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
9 The one who says that he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until
now. 10 The one who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no occasion
for stumbling in him. 11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and
walks in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has
blinded his eyes.
12 I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven because of
his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know the one who is from
the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil
one. I have written to you, little children, because you know the Father. 14 I have
written to you, fathers, because you know the one who is from the beginning. I have
written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in
you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world nor the things
that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
* 1:4 Some older versions read, And we are writing these things to you so that your joy will be complete .1 John 2:16
1271
1 John 3:16
16 For everything that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
the arrogance of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. 17 The world and
its desire are passing away. But whoever does the will of God will remain forever.
18 Little children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that the antichrist is coming,
now many antichrists have come. By this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They
went out from us, but they were not from us. For if they had been from us they would
have remained with us. But when they went out, that showed they were not from us.
20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know the truth. * 21 I
did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and
because no lie is from the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus
is the Christ? That person is the antichrist, since he denies the Father and the Son.
23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever acknowledges the Son also
has the Father. 24 As for you, let what you have heard from the beginning remain in
you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in
the Son and in the Father. 25 This is the promise he gave to us—eternal life. 26 I have
written these things to you about those who would lead you astray. 27 As for you, the
anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone
to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you everything and is true and is not a lie,
and just as it has taught you, remain in him.
28 Now, dear children, remain in him, so that when he appears, we will have
boldness and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is
righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born from him.
3
1 See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children
of God, and this is what we are. For this reason, the world does not know us, because
it did not know him. * 2 Beloved, we are now children of God, and it has not yet been
revealed what we will be. We know that when Christ appears, we will be like him,
for we will see him just as he is. 3 Everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies
himself just as he is pure. 4 Everyone who sins is committing acts of lawlessness, for
sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that Christ was revealed in order to take away sins,
and in him there is no sin. 6 No one who remains in him will keep on sinning. No
one who continues to sin has seen him or known him. 7 Dear children, do not let
anyone lead you astray. The one who does righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is
righteous. 8 The one who commits sin is from the devil, for the devil has sinned from
the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed, so that he would destroy
the devil's works. 9 Whoever has been born from God does not continue to sin because
God's seed remains in him. He cannot continue to sin because he has been born of
God. 10 In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed: Whoever
does not do what is righteous is not from God, neither is the one who does not love
his brother. 11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: We
should love one another. 12 We should not be like Cain, who was from the evil one
and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were evil and
his brother's righteous.
13 Do not be amazed, my brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have
passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Anyone who does not love
remains in death. 15 Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer. You know that no
murderer has eternal life residing in him. 16 By this we know love, because Christ

all things .1 John 3:17
1272
1 John 4:21
laid down his life for us. We also ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 17 But
whoever has the world's goods, sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart of
compassion from him, how does the love of God remain in him? 18 My dear children,
let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in actions and truth. 19 It is by this we know
that we are from the truth, and we assure our hearts before him. 20 For if our hearts
condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things. 21 Beloved, if
our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. 22 Whatever we ask
we will receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things
that are pleasing before him. 23 This is his commandment: that we should believe
in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he gave us this
commandment. 24 The one who keeps God's commandments remains in him, and
God remains in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit whom he
gave to us.
4
1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit. Instead, test the spirits to see whether they
are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this
you will know the Spirit of God—every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has
come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is
not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming,
and now is already in the world. * 4 You are from God, dear children, and have
overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the
world. 5 They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the
world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. He
who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the
spirit of error.
7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and everyone who loves is
born from God and knows God. 8 The person who does not love does not know God,
for God is love. 9 Because of this the love of God was revealed among us, that God
has sent his only Son into the world so that we would live because of him. 10 In this
is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and that he sent his Son to be
the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also should love one
another. 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us,
and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we remain in him and he in
us, because he has given us some of his Spirit. 14 Also, we have seen and have borne
witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever
acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God. 16 Also,
we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one
who remains in this love remains in God, and God remains in him. 17 Because of this,
this love has been made perfect among us, so that we will have confidence on the
day of judgment, because as he is, just so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in
love. Instead, perfect love throws out fear, because fear has to do with punishment.
But the one who fears has not been made perfect in love. 19 We love because God
first loved us. 20 If anyone says, “I love God” but hates his brother, he is a liar. For
the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he
has not seen. 21 Also, this is the commandment we have from him: Whoever loves
God must also love his own brother.
* 4:3 Some older versions read, and every spirit that does not acknowledge that Jesus has come in the flesh is
not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now is already in the world

1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born from God, and whoever loves a
father also loves the child born from him. 2 Because of this we know that we love
God's children, when we love God and do his commandments. 3 For this is love for
God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
4 For everyone who is born from God overcomes the world. And this is the victory
that has overcome the world, even our faith. 5 Who is the one who overcomes the
world? The one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 This is the one who came
by water and blood: Jesus Christ. He came not only by water, but also by water and
blood. 7 For there are three who bear witness: 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood.
These three are in agreement. * 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God
is greater. For the testimony of God is this, that he has borne witness concerning his
Son. 10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Anyone
who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed
the witness that God has given concerning his Son. 11 And the witness is this: God
gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son has life.
The one who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
13 I have written to you these things so that you will know that you have eternal
life—to you who believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 Also, this is the confidence
we have before him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
15 Also, if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask of him—we know that we
have whatever we have asked of him. 16 If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that
does not result in death, he must pray, and God will give him life. I refer to those
whose sin does not result in death. There is a sin that results in death; I am not saying
that he should pray about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does
not result in death.
18 We know that whoever is born from God does not sin. But the one who was born
from God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him. 19 We know that we are
from God, and we know that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 But
we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we
may know him who is true. Also, we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.
This one is the true God and eternal life. 21 Children, keep yourselves from idols.
* 5:8 Some older versions read, For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the
Holy Spirit. These three are one; and there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the
blood; and these three are as one . However, the best copies do not have this reading.2 John 1

Second John
1 From the elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and
not only I, but also all those who have known the truth— 2 because of the truth that
remains in us and will be with us forever. 3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us
from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
4 I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, just as
we have received this commandment from the Father. 5 Now I plead with you, lady—
not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but one that we have had
from the beginning—that we should love one another. 6 This is love, that we should
walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you heard
from the beginning, that you should walk in it. 7 For many deceivers have gone out
into the world, and they do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the
deceiver and the antichrist. 8 Look to yourselves, that you do not lose the things for
which we all have worked, but so that you may receive a full reward. 9 Whoever goes
on ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one
who remains in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son. 10 If anyone
comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house
and do not greet him. 11 For the one who greets him participates in his evil deeds.
12 I have many things to write to you, but I did not wish to write them with paper
and ink. However, I expect to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy will
be complete. 13 The children of your chosen sister greet you.3 John 1

Third John
1 The elder to beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
2 Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be healthy, just
as it is well with your soul. 3 For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and bore
witness to your truth, just as you walk in truth. 4 I have no greater joy than this, to
hear that my children walk in the truth.
5 Beloved, you practice faithfulness whenever you work for the brothers and for
strangers 6 who have borne witness of your love in the presence of the church. You
do well to send them off on their journey in a manner worthy of God, 7 because it
was for the sake of the name that they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
8 We therefore should welcome such as these, so that we will be fellow workers for
the truth.
9 I wrote something to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among
them, does not receive us. 10 So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing,
talking wicked nonsense against us. Not satisfied with that, he not only refused to
welcome the brothers himself, but he also stops those who want to welcome them
and puts them out of the church. 11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but what
is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
12 Demetrius is borne witness to by all and by the truth itself. We also bear witness,
and you know that our testimony is true.
13 I had many things to write to you, but I do not wish to write them to you with
pen and ink. 14 But I expect to see you soon, and we will speak face to face. 15 May
peace be with you. The friends greet you. Greet our friends there by name.Jude 1
1276
Jude 25
Jude
1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are called,
beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ: 2 May mercy and peace and love
be multiplied to you.
3 Beloved, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common
salvation, I had to write to you to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith that
was entrusted once for all to the holy people. 4 For certain men have slipped in
secretly among you. These are men who were marked out for condemnation. They
are ungodly men who have changed the grace of our God into sensuality, and who
deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
5 Now I wish to remind you—although once you fully knew it—that the Lord saved
a people out of the land of Egypt, but that afterward he destroyed those who did not
believe. 6 Also angels who did not keep to their own position of authority, but who
left their proper dwelling place—God has kept them in everlasting chains, in utter
darkness, for the judgment on the great day. 7 It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah
and the cities around them, which also indulged themselves in sexual immorality and
pursued unnatural desires. They were displayed as examples of those who suffer the
punishment in eternal fire. 8 Yet in the same way, these dreamers also pollute their
bodies. They reject authority, and they say slanderous things against the glorious
ones. 9 But even Michael the archangel, when he was arguing with the devil and
disputing with him about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous
judgment against him. Instead he said, “May the Lord rebuke you!” 10 But these
people slander whatever they do not understand, and what they do understand—
what unreasoning animals know by instinct—these are what destroy them. 11 Woe to
them! For they have walked in the way of Cain and have plunged into Balaam's error
for profit. They have perished in Korah's rebellion. 12 These are the ones who are
hidden reefs in your love feasts, when they feast with you shamelessly—shepherds
who only feed themselves. They are clouds without rain, carried along by winds. They
are autumn trees without fruit—twice dead, torn up by the roots. 13 They are violent
waves in the sea, foaming out their own shame. They are wandering stars, for whom
the gloom of thick darkness has been reserved forever. 14 Enoch, the seventh from
Adam, prophesied about them, saying, “Look! The Lord is coming with thousands and
thousands of his holy ones. 15 He is coming to execute judgment on everyone. He is
coming to convict all the ungodly of all the works they have done in an ungodly way,
and of all the harsh words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” 16 These
are grumblers, complainers, who follow their evil desires. They are loud boasters,
who, for their own advantage, flatter others.
17 But you, beloved, remember the words that were spoken in the past by the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 18 They said to you, “In the last time there will
be mockers who will follow their own ungodly desires.” 19 It is these who cause
divisions; they are worldly and they do not have the Spirit. 20 But you, beloved, build
yourselves up in your most holy faith, and pray in the Holy Spirit. 21 Keep yourselves
in God's love, and wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that brings you eternal
life. 22 Be merciful to those who doubt. 23 Save others by snatching them out of the
fire. To others be merciful with fear. Hate even the garment stained by the flesh.

before his glorious presence without blemish and with great joy, 25 to the only GodJude 25

Revelation
1 This is the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his servants what
must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John.
2 John testified about the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all the things
that he saw. 3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud this prophecy, and those who listen
to the words of this prophecy and who obey what is written in it, because the time
is near.
4 John, to the seven churches in Asia: May grace be to you and peace from the one
who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before
his throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from
the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has
released us from our sins by his blood— 6 he has made us a kingdom, priests for his
God and Father—to him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
7 Look, he is coming with the clouds;
every eye will see him,
including those who pierced him.
All the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him.
Yes, Amen.
8 “I am the alpha and the omega,” says the Lord God, “the one who is, and who
was, and who is to come, the Almighty.” *
9 I, John—your brother and the one who shares with you in the suffering and
kingdom and patient endurance that are in Jesus—was on the island called Patmos
because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. 10 I was in the Spirit on
the Lord's day. I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet. 11 It said, “Write
what you see in a book, and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, to Smyrna,
to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.” 12 I turned
around to see whose voice was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw seven golden
lampstands. 13 In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a son of man,
wearing a long robe that reached down to his feet and a golden sash around his
chest. 14 His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow—and his eyes
were like a flame of fire. 15 His feet were like polished bronze, like bronze that had
been refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters.
16 He had seven stars in his right hand, and a sword with two sharp edges was coming
out of his mouth. His face was shining like the sun at its strongest. 17 When I saw
him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand on me and said, “Do
not be afraid. I am the first and the last, 18 and the one who lives. I was dead, but
look, I live forever! And I have the keys of death and of Hades. 19 Therefore write
down what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place after this. 20 As for
the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and the seven
golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the
seven lampstands are the seven churches.”

among the seven golden lampstands, 2 “I know what you have done and your hard

labor and your patient endurance. I know that you cannot tolerate the evil people.
I know that you have tested those who say they are apostles, but are not, and that
you have found them to be false. 3 I know you have patient endurance, and you have
suffered much because of my name, and that you have not grown weary. 4 But I have
against you the fact that you have left behind your first love. 5 Remember therefore
from where you have fallen. Repent and do the things you did at first. Unless you
repent, I will come to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place. 6 But you
have this: You hate what the Nicolaitans have done, which I also hate. 7 Let the one
who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To the one who
conquers I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of
God.”'”
8 “To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:
'The words of the one who is the first and the last, the one who was dead and who
became alive again: 9 “I know your sufferings and your poverty, but you are rich.
I know the slander of those who say they are Jews, but they are not. They are a
synagogue of Satan. 10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look! The devil is
about to throw some of you into prison so that you will be tested, and you will suffer
for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. 11 Let the
one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. The one who
conquers will not be hurt by the second death.”'”
12 “To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:
'The words of the one who has the sword with two sharp edges: 13 “I know where
you live, there where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold on tightly to my name. I know
that you did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas my witness,
my faithful one, who was killed among you, there where Satan lives. 14 But I have
a few things against you: You have there some who hold tightly to the teaching of
Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, so
they would eat food sacrificed to idols and be sexually immoral. 15 In the same way,
you even have some who hold tightly to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 16 Repent,
therefore! If you do not, I will quickly come to you, and I will wage war against them
with the sword in my mouth. 17 Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit
is saying to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden
manna, and I will give a white stone with a new name written on the stone, a name
which no one knows but the one who receives it.”'”
18 “To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:
'These are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet
like polished bronze: 19 “I know what you have done: your love and faith and service
and your patient endurance. I know that what you have done recently is more than
you did at first. 20 But I have this against you: You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who
calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she deceives my servants to commit sexual
immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 21 I gave her time to repent, but she is
not willing to repent of her immorality. 22 Look! I will throw her onto a sickbed, and
those who commit adultery with her into great suffering, unless they repent of her
deeds. 23 I will strike her children dead, and all the churches will know that I am the
one who searches thoughts and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to
your deeds. 24 But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to everyone who does not hold this
teaching, and does not know what some call the deep things of Satan—to you I say, 'I
do not put any other burden on you.' 25 In any case, you must hold on tightly until I
come.

1 “To the angel of the church in Sardis write:
'The words of the one who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. “I
know what you have done. You have a reputation that you are alive, but you are
dead. 2 Wake up and strengthen what remains, but is about to die, because I have not
found your deeds complete in the sight of my God. 3 Remember, therefore, what you
have received and heard. Obey it, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come
as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come against you. 4 But you have
a few names in Sardis who have not stained their clothes, and they will walk with
me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. 5 The one who conquers will be clothed
in white garments, and I will never wipe his name out of the Book of Life, and I will
speak his name before my Father, and before his angels. 6 Let the one who has an
ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”'”
7 “To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:

he holds the key of David,
he opens and no one shuts,
he shuts and no one can open.
8 “I know what you have done. Look, I have put before you an open door that no
one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have obeyed my word
and have not denied my name. 9 Look! Those who belong to the synagogue of Satan
who say they are Jews but are not, but they are liars—I will make them come and
bow down before your feet, and they will come to know that I loved you. 10 Since
you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour
of testing that is coming on the whole world, to test those who live on the earth. 11 I
am coming soon. Hold to what you have so no one can take away your crown. 12 The
one who conquers, I will make like a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will
he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, the name of the city of
my God (the new Jerusalem, that comes down out of heaven from my God), and my
new name. 13 Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the
churches.”'”

15 “I know what you have done, and that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you
were either cold or hot! 16 So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I
am about to vomit you out of my mouth. 17 For you say, 'I am rich, I have had many
material possessions, and I need nothing.' But you do not know that you are most
miserable, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. 18 Listen to my advice: Buy from me gold
refined by fire so that you may become rich, and brilliant white garments so you may
clothe yourself and not show the shame of your nakedness, and salve to anoint your
eyes so you will see. 19 I train everyone whom I love, and I teach them how they
should live. Therefore, be earnest and repent. 20 Look, I am standing at the door and
am knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into his home
and will eat with him, and he with me. 21 The one who conquers, I will give him the
right to sit down with me on my throne, just as I also conquered and sat down withRevelation 3:22

saying to the churches.”'”
4
1 After these things I looked, and I saw an open door in heaven.
The first voice
that I had heard was speaking to me like a trumpet, saying, “Come up here, and I
will show you what must happen after these things.” 2 At once I was in the Spirit,
and I saw there was a throne placed in heaven, with someone sitting on it. 3 The one
who was sitting on it looked like jasper and carnelian. There was a rainbow around
the throne. The rainbow looked like an emerald. 4 Around the throne were twenty-
four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, dressed with white
garments, with golden crowns on their heads. 5 From the throne came flashes of
lightning, rumblings, and crashes of thunder. Seven lamps were burning in front of
the throne, lamps that were the seven spirits of God. 6 Before the throne was a sea of
glass, like crystal. In the middle of the throne and around the throne were four living
creatures, full of eyes, front and back. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, the
second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man,
and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 8 The four living creatures each
had six wings, full of eyes on top and underneath. Night and day they do not stop
saying,
“Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord God Almighty
who was, and who is, and who is to come.”
9 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on
the throne, the one who lives forever and ever, 10 the twenty-four elders fall down
before the one seated on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever.
They lay their crowns before the throne, saying,
11 “Worthy are you, our Lord and our God,
to receive glory and honor and power,
for you created all things,
and by your will they existed and were created.”
5
1 Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll
written on the front and on the back, sealed with seven seals. 2 I saw a mighty angel
proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
3 No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or
to read it. 4 I wept bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to
read it. 5 But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Look! The Lion of the tribe
of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered. He is able to open the scroll and its seven
seals.” 6 I saw a Lamb standing in the middle of the throne area and among the four
living creatures and among the elders. He looked as though he had been killed. He
had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all
the earth. 7 He went and took hold of the scroll out of the right hand of the one who
was seated on the throne. 8 When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures
and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and
a golden bowl full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 9 They sang a new
song:
“You are worthy to take the scroll
and to open its seals.Revelation 5:10
1282
Revelation 6:15
For you were slaughtered, and with your blood you purchased people for God
from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
10 You made them a kingdom and priests to serve our God,
and they will reign on the earth.”
11 Then I looked and heard the sound of many angels who encircled the throne and
the living creatures and the elders. Their total number was ten thousands of ten
thousands and thousands of thousands. 12 They said in a loud voice,
“Worthy is the Lamb who has been slaughtered to receive power, wealth, wisdom,
strength, honor, glory, and praise.”
13 I heard every created thing that was in heaven and on the earth and under the
earth and on the sea—everything in them—saying,
“To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise, honor, glory, and
the power to rule, forever and ever.”
14 The four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
*
6
1 I looked when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the
four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder, “Come!” 2 I looked and
there was a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown. He came
out as a conqueror in order to conquer.
3 When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say,
“Come!” 4 Then another horse came out—fiery red. To its rider was given permission
to take peace away from the earth, so that its people would slaughter one another.
This rider was given a huge sword.
5 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say,
“Come!” I saw a black horse, and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. 6 I
heard what seemed to be a voice among the four living creatures say, “A choenix
of wheat for one denarius, and three choenices of barley for a denarius. But do not
harm the oil and the wine.”
7 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living
creature say, “Come!” 8 Then I saw a pale horse. The rider on it was named Death,
and Hades was following him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the
earth, to kill with the sword, with famine and disease, and with the wild animals of
the earth.
9 When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those
who had been killed because of the word of God and the testimony which they held.
10 They cried out with a loud voice, “How long, Ruler over all, holy and true, until
you judge those who live on the earth, and until you avenge our blood?” 11 Then
each of them was given a white robe, and they were told that they should wait a little
longer until the full number of their fellow servants and their brothers and sisters
was reached who were to be killed, just as they had been killed.
12 When the Lamb opened the sixth seal, I watched and there was a great
earthquake. The sun became as black as sackcloth, and the full moon became like
blood. 13 The stars in the heavens fell to the earth, just as a fig tree drops its unripe
fruit when shaken by a stormy wind. 14 The sky vanished like a scroll that was being
rolled up. Every mountain and island was moved out of its place. 15 Then the kings of
the earth and the important people, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful,
and everyone else, slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
* 5:14 Some older versions read, the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the one who lives forever and
ever .Revelation 6:16
1283
Revelation 7:17
16 They said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us! Hide us from the face of
the one who is seated on the throne and from the Lamb's wrath. 17 For the great day
of their wrath has come. Who is able to stand?”
7
1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, tightly holding
back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow on the earth, on the
sea, or against any tree. 2 I saw another angel coming up from the east, who had the
seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels who were
given permission to harm the earth and the sea: 3 “Do not harm the earth, the sea,
or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” 4 I
heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000, who were sealed from every
tribe of the people of Israel:
5 twelve thousand from the tribe of Judah,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Reuben,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Gad,
6 twelve thousand from the tribe of Asher,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Naphtali,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Manasseh,
7 twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar,
8 twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, and
twelve thousand from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
9 After these things I looked, and there was a huge multitude that no one could
count—from every nation, tribe, people, and language—standing before the throne
and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and holding palm branches
in their hands, 10 and they were calling out with a loud voice:
“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
11 All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four
living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne. They worshiped God,
12 saying,
“Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and strength be to
our God forever and ever! Amen!”
13 Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these, clothed with white robes, and
where did they come from?” 14 I said to him, “Sir, you know,” and he said to me,
“These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. They have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
15 For this reason, they are before the throne of God,
and they worship him day and night in his temple.
The one who is seated on the throne will spread his tent over them.
16 They will not be hungry again, nor will they be thirsty again.
The sun will not beat down on them,
nor any burning heat.
17 For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd,
and he will guide them to springs of living water,
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”Revelation 8:1

1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was a silence in heaven for about
half an hour. 2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets
were given to them.
3 Another angel came, holding a golden incense bowl, standing at the incense altar.
Much incense was given to him so that he would offer it with the prayers of all the
saints on the golden incense altar before the throne. 4 The smoke of the incense,
with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the angel's hand. 5 The angel
took the incense bowl and filled it with fire from the altar. Then he threw it down to
the earth, and there were crashes of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an
earthquake.
6 The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
7 The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood.
It was thrown down onto the earth so that a third of it was burned up, a third of the
trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. *
8 The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain
burning with fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea became blood, 9 a
third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
10 The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a huge star fell from the sky, blazing
like a torch, on a third of the rivers and springs of water. 11 The name of the star is
Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from
the waters that became bitter.
12 The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, as well
as a third of the moon and a third of the stars. So a third of them turned dark; a third
of the day and a third of the night had no light.
13 I looked, and I heard an eagle † that was flying overhead calling out with a loud
voice, “Woe, woe, woe, to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining
trumpet blasts that are about to be sounded by the three angels.”
9
1 Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet. I saw a star from heaven that had fallen
to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. 2 He opened
the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the shaft like smoke from
a huge furnace. The sun and the air turned dark by the smoke pouring out of the
shaft. 3 Out of the smoke locusts came on the earth, and they were given power like
that of scorpions on the earth. 4 They were told not to damage the grass on the earth
or any green plant or tree, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on
their foreheads. 5 They were not given permission to kill those people, but only to
torture them for five months. Their agony would be like the sting of a scorpion when
it strikes a person. 6 In those days people will seek death, but will not find it. They
will greatly desire to die, but death will flee from them. 7 The locusts looked like
horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like crowns of gold, and
their faces were like human faces. 8 They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth
were like lions' teeth. 9 They had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of
their wings was like the sound made by many chariots and horses running into battle.
10 They had tails with stingers like scorpions; in their tails they had power to harm
people for five months. 11 They had as king over them the angel of the bottomless
pit. His name in Hebrew was Abaddon, and in Greek he had the name Apollyon.

Revelation 11:6
12 The first woe is past. Look! After this there are still two disasters to come.
13 The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the horns
of the golden altar that is present before God. 14 The voice said to the sixth angel
who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates
River.” 15 The four angels who had been prepared for that hour, that day, that month,
and that year, were released to kill a third of mankind. 16 The number of the soldiers
on horseback was 200,000,000. I heard their number. 17 This is how I saw the horses
in my vision and those who rode on them: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark
blue and sulfurous yellow. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and
out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur. 18 A third of the people were killed
by these three plagues: the fire, smoke, and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
19 For the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails—for their tails
were like snakes, and they had heads with which they inflicted wounds on people.
20 The rest of mankind, those who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent
of the deeds they had done, nor did they stop worshiping demons and idols of gold,
silver, bronze, stone, and wood—things that cannot see, hear, or walk. 21 Neither did
they repent of their murders, their sorcery, their sexual immorality or their acts of
theft.
10
1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a
cloud, and there was a rainbow above his head. His face was like the sun and his feet
were like pillars of fire. 2 He held a little scroll, which was opened in his hand. He
put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. 3 Then he shouted in a loud
voice like a roaring lion. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke out with their
sounds. 4 When the seven thunders spoke out, I was about to write, but I heard a
voice from heaven saying, “Keep secret what the seven thunders said. Do not write it
down.” 5 Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and the earth raised his right hand
to heaven. 6 He swore by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven
and all that is in it, the earth and all that is on it, and the sea and all that is in it, and
the angel said, “There will be no more delay. 7 But on the day when the seventh angel
is about to sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as
he proclaimed to his servants the prophets.” 8 The voice I heard from heaven spoke
to me again: “Go, take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel standing on
the sea and on the land.” 9 Then I went to the angel and told him to give me the little
scroll. He said to me, “Take the scroll and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but
in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.” 10 I took the little scroll from the angel's
hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but after I ate it, my stomach
became bitter. 11 Then someone said to me, “You must prophesy again about many
peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”
11
1 A reed was given to me to use like a measuring rod.
I was told, “Get up and
measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it. 2 But do not
measure the courtyard outside the temple, for it has been given over to the Gentiles.
They will trample the holy city for forty-two months. 3 I will give my two witnesses
authority to prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” 4 These witnesses are
the two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the Lord of the
earth. 5 If anyone chooses to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours
their enemies. Anyone who wishes to harm them must be killed in this way. 6 TheseRevelation 11:7
1286
Revelation 12:6
witnesses have authority to close up the sky so that no rain will fall during the time
that they prophesy. They have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the
earth with every kind of plague whenever they wish. 7 When they will have finished
their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against
them. He will conquer them and kill them. 8 Their bodies will lie in the street of
the great city (which is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt) where their Lord was
crucified. 9 For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language, and
nation will look at their bodies. They will not permit them to be placed in a tomb.
10 Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate. They will even
send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who lived on
the earth. 11 But after three and a half days a breath of life from God will enter them,
and they will stand on their feet. Great fear will fall on those who see them. 12 Then
they will hear a loud voice from heaven say to them, “Come up here!” Then they
will go up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies look on. 13 At that hour there
will be a major earthquake, and a tenth part of the city will collapse. Seven thousand
people will be killed in the earthquake, and the survivors will be terrified and give
glory to the God of heaven.
14 The second woe is past. Look! The third woe is coming quickly.
15 Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and loud voices spoke in heaven
and said,
“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.
He will reign forever and ever.”
16 Then the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones in the presence of God, fell
upon their faces and worshiped God. 17 They said,
“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the one who is and who was,
because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. *
18 The nations were enraged,
but your wrath has come.
The time has come for the dead to be judged
and for you to reward your servants the prophets,
those who are believers, and those who feared your name,
both the unimportant and the mighty.
The time has come for you to destroy those who are destroying the earth.”
19 Then God's temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen
within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, crashes of thunder, an
earthquake, and a great hailstorm.
12
1 A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and with the moon
under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars was on her head. 2 She was pregnant, and
she was crying out in birth pains, in the anguish of childbirth. 3 Then another sign
was seen in heaven: Look! There was a huge red dragon that had seven heads and
ten horns, and there were seven crowns on his heads. 4 His tail swept away a third of
the stars in heaven and hurled them down to the earth. The dragon stood before the
woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth, he would devour
her child. 5 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who would rule all the nations with
an iron rod. Her child was snatched away to God and to his throne, 6 and the woman
* 11:17 Some copies read the ruler over all, the one who is and who was, and who is to come, but most modern
versions do not.Revelation 12:7
1287
Revelation 13:9
fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her, so she could be
taken care of for 1,260 days.
7 Now there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;
and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But the dragon was not strong enough to
win. So there was no longer any place in heaven for him and his angels. 9 The great
dragon—that old serpent called the devil or Satan, who deceives the whole world—
was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 10 Then
I heard a loud voice in heaven:
“Now have come the salvation and the power
and the kingdom of our God,
and the authority of his Christ.
For the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down,
the one who accused them before our God day and night.
11 They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,
for they did not love their lives even to death.
12 Therefore rejoice you heavens,
and all who reside in them!
But woe to the earth and to the sea,
because the devil has gone down to you!
He is filled with terrible anger
because he has only a little time!
13 When the dragon realized he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued
the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 But the woman was given the
two wings of a great eagle, so that she would flee to the place prepared for her in the
wilderness. This was the place where she would be taken care of, for a time, times,
and half a time—out of the serpent's presence. 15 The serpent poured water out of his
mouth like a river, that he would make a flood to sweep her away. 16 But the earth
helped the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the
dragon was pouring out of his mouth. 17 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman
and went off to wage war with the rest of her descendants, those who obey God's
commandments and hold to the testimony about Jesus. 18 Then the dragon stood on
the sand of the seashore.
13
1 Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea.
It had ten horns and seven heads.
On its horns were ten crowns, and on each of its heads was a blasphemous name.
2 This beast I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like a bear's feet, and its mouth
was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave his power to it, and his throne, and his
great authority to rule. 3 One of the beast's heads appeared to have been killed, but
its fatal wound was healed. The whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
4 They also worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast. They
worshiped the beast, too, and kept saying, “Who is like the beast?” and “Who can
fight against it?” 5 The beast was given a mouth that could speak proud words and
blasphemies. It was permitted to exercise authority for forty-two months. 6 So the
beast opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God—blaspheming his name,
the place where he lives, and those who live in heaven. 7 The beast was permitted to
wage war with the saints and to conquer them. Also, authority was given to it over
every tribe, people, language, and nation. 8 All who live on the earth will worship it,
everyone whose name was not written, since the creation of the world, in the Book
of Life, which belongs to the Lamb, who had been slaughtered. 9 If anyone has an
ear, let him listen.Revelation 13:10
1288
Revelation 14:12
10 If anyone is to be taken into captivity,
into captivity he will go.
If anyone is to be killed with the sword,
with the sword he will be killed.
Here is a call for the patient endurance and faith of the saints.
11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a
lamb, and it spoke like a dragon. 12 It exercised all the authority of the first beast in its
presence, and it made the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast—the
one whose lethal wound had been healed. 13 It performed mighty miracles. It even
made fire come down on the earth from heaven in front of people. 14 By the signs it
was permitted to do, it deceived those who lived on the earth. It told them to make an
image in honor of the beast that had the sword wound but lived. 15 It was permitted
to give breath to the beast's image so that the image would even speak and cause all
who refused to worship the beast to be killed. 16 It also forced everyone, unimportant
and mighty, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on the right hand or on
the forehead. 17 It was impossible for anyone to buy or sell unless he had the mark
of the beast, that is, the number representing its name. 18 This calls for wisdom. If
anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast. For it is the number
of a human being. Its number is 666.
14
1 I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were 144,000 who
had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. 2 I heard a voice
from heaven sounding like a roar of many waters and loud thunder. The sound I
heard was also like harpists playing their harps. 3 They sang a new song before the
throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the
song except for the 144,000 who had been bought from the earth. 4 These are the
ones that have not defiled themselves with women, for they have kept themselves
sexually pure. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were bought
out of mankind as firstfruits for God and for the Lamb. 5 No lie was found in their
mouth; they are blameless. *
6 I saw another angel flying in midair, who had the eternal message of good news to
proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
7 He called out with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory. For the hour of his
judgment has come. Worship him, the one who made the heaven, the earth, the sea,
and the springs of water.”
8 Another angel—a second angel—followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
great, who persuaded all the nations to drink the wine of her immoral passion.”
9 Another angel—a third angel—followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone
worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
10 he will also drink some of the wine of God's wrath, the wine that has been poured
undiluted into the cup of his anger. The person who drinks it will be tormented with
fire and sulfur before God's holy angels and before the Lamb. 11 The smoke from
their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night—these
worshipers of the beast and his image, and everyone who receives the mark of his
name. 12 Here is a call for the patient endurance of the saints, those who obey the
commandments of God and faith in Jesus.”
* 14:5 Some older copies add, before the throne of God .Revelation 14:13
1289
Revelation 16:3
13 I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the
Lord.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds
will follow them.”
14 I looked, and there was a white cloud. Seated on the cloud was one like a son
of man. He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 Then
another angel came out of the temple and called with a loud voice to the one sitting
on the cloud: “Take your sickle and start to reap. For the time to reap has come, since
the harvest of the earth is ripe.” 16 Then the one who was sitting on the cloud swung
his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
17 Another angel came out from the temple in heaven; he also had a sharp sickle.
18 Still another angel came out from the incense altar, who had authority over the
fire. He called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Take your
sharp sickle and gather in the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth, for their
grapes are now ripe.” 19 The angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the
grape harvest of the earth. He threw it into the great wine vat of God's wrath. 20 The
winepress was stomped outside the city, and blood poured out from it up to the height
of a horse's bridle, for 1,600 stadia.
15
1 Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: There were seven angels
with seven plagues, which are the final plagues, for with them the wrath of God will
be completed.
2 I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire. Standing beside the
sea were those who had been victorious over the beast and his image, and over the
number representing his name. They were holding harps given to them by God.
3 They were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, the song of the Lamb:
“Great and marvelous are your deeds,
Lord God, the Almighty.
Just and true are your ways,
King of the nations.
4 Who will not fear you, Lord,
and glorify your name?
For you alone are holy.
All nations will come
and worship before you
because your righteous deeds have been revealed.”
5 After these things I looked, and the temple having the tent of witness was open
in heaven. 6 Out of the most holy place came the seven angels holding the seven
plagues. They were clothed with pure, bright linen and had golden sashes around
their chests. 7 One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden
bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 8 The temple was filled
with smoke from the glory of God and from his power. No one could enter it until
the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
16
1 I heard a loud voice call out of the temple and say to the seven angels, “Go and
pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath.”
2 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; ugly and painful sores
came on the people who had the mark of the beast, those who worshiped his image.
3 The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea. It became blood, like the blood
of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.Revelation 16:4
1290
Revelation 17:4
4 The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and
they became blood. 5 I heard the angel of the waters say,
“You are righteous—the one who is and who was, the Holy One—
because you have judged these things. *
6 Because they poured out the blood of the saints and prophets,
you have given them blood to drink;
it is what they deserve.”
7 I heard the altar reply,
“Yes, Lord God Almighty,
your judgments are true and righteous.”
8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given permission
to scorch the people with fire. 9 They were scorched by the terrible heat, and they
blasphemed the name of God, who has the power over these plagues. They did not
repent or give him glory.
10 Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and darkness
covered its kingdom. They chewed on their tongues because of the pain. 11 They
blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pain and sores, and they still refused
to repent of what they had done.
12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl into the great river, the Euphrates. Its water
was dried up in order to prepare the way for the kings that would come from the
east. 13 I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouths of
the dragon, of the beast, and of the false prophet. 14 For they are spirits of demons
performing miraculous signs. They were going out to the kings of the whole world
in order to gather them together for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
15 (“Look! I am coming as a thief! Blessed is the one who keeps watching, keeping his
garments on so that he will not go out naked and they see his shameful condition.”)
16 They brought them together at the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.
17 Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. Then a loud voice came
out of the temple and from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 18 There were flashes
of lightning, rumbles, crashes of thunder, and a terrible earthquake—an earthquake
greater than any that has ever happened since human beings have been on the earth,
so great was this earthquake. 19 The great city was split into three parts, and the
nations' cities collapsed. Then God called to mind Babylon the great, and he gave
that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath. 20 Every island
disappeared, and the mountains were no longer found. 21 Great hailstones, weighing
about a talent, came down from the sky upon the people. They cursed God for the
plague of hail because that plague was so terrible.
17
1 One of the seven angels who had been holding the seven bowls came and said to
me, “Come, I will show you the condemnation of the great prostitute who is seated on
many waters. 2 It is with her that the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality.
It is with the wine of her sexual immorality that the earth's inhabitants became
drunk.” 3 Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit to a wilderness, and I saw
a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names. The beast
had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and
was adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She was holding in her hand
a golden cup full of detestable things and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
* 16:5 Some older copies read, You are righteous, Lord—the one who is and who was and who is to be, because
you have judged these things .Revelation 17:5
1291
Revelation 18:7
5 On her forehead was written a name having a secret meaning: “Babylon the great,
the mother of prostitutes and of the detestable things of the earth.” 6 I saw that the
woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs for
Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. 7 But the angel said to me, “Why
are you astonished? I will explain to you the meaning of the woman and of the beast
that is carrying her, the beast that has the seven heads and the ten horns. 8 The beast
you saw existed, does not exist now, but is about to come up from the bottomless pit.
Then it will go on to destruction. Those who live on the earth, those whose names
have not been written in the Book of Life since the foundation of the world—they will
be astounded when they see the beast that existed, does not exist now, but is about
to come. 9 This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on
which the woman is seated. 10 They are also seven kings. Five kings have fallen, one
exists, and the other has not yet come; when he comes, he can remain only for a little
while. 11 The beast that existed, but does not exist now, is itself also an eighth king;
but it is one of those seven kings, and it is going to destruction. 12 The ten horns that
you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive
authority as kings for one hour together with the beast. 13 These are of one mind,
and they give over their power and authority to the beast. 14 They will wage war
against the Lamb. But the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and
King of kings—and with him are the called ones, the chosen ones, and the faithful
ones.” 15 The angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute is seated,
are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. 16 The ten horns that you saw—they
and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, they
will devour her flesh, and they will burn her completely with fire. 17 For God has put
it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give their power to rule to
the beast until God's words are fulfilled. 18 The woman you saw is the great city that
rules over the kings of the earth.”
18
1 After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven. He had great
authority, and the earth was illumined by his glory. 2 He cried out with a mighty
voice, saying,
“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!
She has become a dwelling place for demons,
a refuge for every unclean spirit,
and a refuge for every unclean and detestable bird.
3 For all the nations have drunk the wine of her immoral passion.
The kings of the earth have committed immorality with her.
The merchants of the earth have become rich from the power of her sensual way of
living.”
4 Then I heard another voice from heaven say,
“Come out from her, my people,
so that you will not share in her sins,
and so that you will not receive any of her plagues.
5 Her sins have piled up as high as heaven,
and God has remembered her evil actions.
6 Pay her back as she has paid others back,
and repay her double for what she has done;
in the cup she mixed, mix double the amount for her.
7 As she glorified herself and lived in luxury,Revelation 18:8
1292
Revelation 18:22
give her just as much torture and grief.
For she says in her heart,
'I am seated as a queen;
I am not a widow,
and I will never see mourning.'
8 Therefore in one day her plagues will come:
death, mourning, and famine.
She will be consumed by fire,
for the Lord God is mighty, and he is her judge.”
9 The kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and went out of control
with her will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning. 10 They
will stand off at a distance, afraid of her torment, saying,
“Woe, woe to the great city,
Babylon, the powerful city!
For in a single hour your punishment has come.”
11 The merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys her
merchandise anymore— 12 merchandise of gold, silver, precious stone, pearls, fine
linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, every vessel of ivory, every
vessel made of most precious wood, bronze, iron, marble, 13 cinnamon, spice, incense,
myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and
chariots, and slaves and human souls. 14 The fruit that you longed for with all
your might is gone from you. All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never
to be found again. 15 The merchants of these goods who became rich by her will
stand away from her at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and
mourning loudly.
16 They will say,
“Woe, woe to the great city
that was dressed in fine linen,
in purple, and in scarlet,
and was adorned with gold,
precious jewels, and pearls!
17 In a single hour all that wealth has been wasted.”
Every ship's captain, every seafaring man, sailors, and all whose living is made from
the sea, stood off at a distance.
18 They cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning. They said, “What city is
like the great city?” 19 They threw dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and
mourning,
“Woe, woe to the great city
where all who had their ships
at sea became rich from her wealth.
For in a single hour she has been destroyed.”
20 “Rejoice over her, heaven,
you believers, apostles, and prophets,
for God has brought your judgment on her!”
21 A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea,
saying,
“In this way, Babylon, the great city,
will be thrown down with violence
and will not be seen anymore.
22 The sound made by harpists, musicians,
flute players, and trumpetersRevelation 18:23
1293
Revelation 19:10
will not be heard anymore in you.
No craftsman of any kind
will be found in you.
No sound of a mill
will be heard anymore in you.
23 The light of a lamp
will not shine in you anymore.
The voices of the bridegroom and the bride
will not be heard in you anymore,
for your merchants were the princes of the earth,
and the nations were deceived by your sorcery.
24 In her the blood of prophets and saints was found,
and the blood of all who have been killed on the earth.”
19
1 After these things I heard what sounded like a loud voice of a large number of
people in heaven saying,
“Hallelujah.
Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.
2 His judgments are true and just,
for he has judged the great prostitute
who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality.
He has taken revenge for the blood of his servants,
which she herself shed.”
3 They spoke a second time:
“Hallelujah!
The smoke rises from her forever and ever.”
4 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God
who was seated on the throne. They were saying,
“Amen. Hallelujah!”
5 Then a voice came out from the throne, saying,
“Praise our God,
all you his servants,
you who fear him,
both the unimportant and the powerful.”
6 Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a great number of people, like the roar
of many waters, and like loud crashes of thunder, saying,
“Hallelujah!
For the Lord reigns, the God who rules over all.
7 Let us rejoice and be very happy
and give him the glory
because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come,
and his bride has made herself ready.
8 She was permitted to be dressed
in bright and clean fine linen”
(for fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints).
9 The angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding
feast of the Lamb.” He also said to me, “These are true words of God.” 10 I fell down
at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “Do not do this! I am a fellow servant
with you and your brothers who hold the testimony about Jesus. Worship God, for
the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”Revelation 19:11
1294
Revelation 20:12
11 Then I saw heaven open, and I looked and there was a white horse.
The one
riding it is called faithful and true. It is with justice that he judges and wages war.
12 His eyes are like a fiery flame, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name
written on him that no one knows but himself. 13 He wears a robe that was dipped
in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. 14 The armies of heaven were
following him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean. 15 Out of his
mouth goes a sharp sword with which he strikes down the nations, and he will rule
them with an iron rod. He tramples in the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God
Almighty. 16 He has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: “King of kings and
Lord of lords.”
17 I saw an angel standing in the sun. He called out in a loud voice to all the birds
flying overhead, “Come, gather together for the great feast of God. 18 Come eat the
flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses
and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, the unimportant and
the powerful.”
19 I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies. They were gathering
in order to wage war with the one who rode the horse and with his army. 20 The
beast was captured and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his
presence. With these signs he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast
and who worshiped his image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake
of burning sulfur. 21 The rest of them were killed by the sword that came out of the
mouth of the one who rode on the horse. All the birds ate their dead flesh.
20
1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven. He had the key to the bottomless
pit, and he had a great chain in his hand. 2 He took hold of the dragon, the old serpent,
which is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. 3 He threw him
into the bottomless pit. He shut it and sealed it over him. This was so that he would
not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that, he
must be set free for a short amount of time.
4 Then I saw thrones. Seated on them were those who had been given authority to
judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony about
Jesus and for the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image, and
they had refused to receive the mark on their forehead or hand. They came to life,
and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years. 5 The rest of the dead did not come
to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed
and holy is anyone who takes part in the first resurrection! Over these the second
death has no power. They will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him
for a thousand years.
7 When the thousand years come to an end, Satan will be released from his prison.
8 He will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth—Gog and
Magog—to bring them together for the battle. They will be as many as the sand of
the sea. 9 They went up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp
of the saints, the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
10 The devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where
the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and
night forever and ever.
11 Then I saw a great white throne and the one who is seated on it. The earth and
the heaven fled away from his presence, but there was no place for them to go. 12 I
saw the dead—the mighty and the unimportant—standing before the throne, and the
books were opened. Then another book was opened—the Book of Life. The deadRevelation 20:13
1295
Revelation 21:24
were judged by what was recorded in the books, according to their deeds. 13 The
sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were
in them, and the dead were judged according to what they had done. 14 Death and
Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire.
15 If anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into
the lake of fire.
21
1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away, and the sea was no more. 2 I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, that
came down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
3 I heard a great voice from the throne saying, “Look! The dwelling place of God is
with human beings, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God
himself will be with them and he will be their God. 4 He will wipe away every tear
from their eyes, and there will be no more death, or grieving, or crying, or pain.
The former things have passed away. 5 The one who was seated on the throne said,
“Look! I make all things new.” He said, “Write this down because these words are
trustworthy and true.” 6 He said to me, “These things are done! I am the alpha and
the omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who thirsts I will give drink without
cost from the spring of the water of life. 7 The one who conquers will inherit these
things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. 8 But as for the cowards, the
faithless, the detestable, the murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters,
and all liars, their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. That is the second
death.”
9 One of the seven angels came to me, the one who had the seven bowls full of
the seven last plagues, and he said, “Come here. I will show you the bride, the
wife of the Lamb.” 10 Then he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high
mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from
God. 11 Jerusalem had the glory of God, and its brilliance was like a very precious
jewel, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper. 12 It had a great, high wall with twelve
gates, with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the
twelve tribes of the children of Israel. 13 On the east were three gates, on the north
three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. 14 The wall of
the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve
apostles of the Lamb. 15 The one who spoke with me had a measuring rod made of
gold to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 16 The city was laid out in a square;
its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with the measuring rod,
twelve thousand stadia in length (its length, width, and height were the same). 17 He
also measured its wall, 144 cubits thick by human measurement (which is also the
angel's measure). 18 The wall was built of jasper and the city of pure gold, like clear
glass. 19 The foundations of the wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone.
The first was jasper, the second was sapphire, the third was agate, the fourth was
emerald, 20 the fifth was onyx, the sixth was carnelian, the seventh was chrysolite,
the eighth was beryl, the ninth was topaz, the tenth was chrysoprase, the eleventh
was jacinth, and the twelfth was amethyst. 21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls;
each of the gates was made from a single pearl. The streets of the city were pure
gold, like transparent glass. 22 I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty
and the Lamb are its temple. 23 The city had no need of the sun or the moon in
order to shine on it because the glory of God shone on it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
24 The nations will walk by the light of that city. The kings of the earth will bringRevelation 21:25
1296
Revelation 22:21
their splendor into it. * 25 Its gates will not be shut during the day, and there will be
no night there. 26 They will bring the splendor and the honor of the nations into it,
27 but nothing unclean will ever enter into it, nor anyone who does what is shameful
or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
22
1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal. It was
flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 through the middle of the city's
street. On each side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits,
and it bears its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the
nations. 3 There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will
be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 4 They will see his face, and his name
will be on their foreheads. 5 There will be no more night; they will have no need for
the light of a lamp or sunlight because the Lord God will shine on them. They will
reign forever and ever.
6 The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God
of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must happen
soon.” 7 “Look! I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who obeys the words of the
prophecy of this book.”
8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw them,
I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things.
9 He said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you, with your brothers
the prophets, and with those who obey the words of this book. Worship God!”
10 He said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the
time is near. 11 The one who is unrighteous, let him continue to do unrighteousness.
The one who is morally filthy, let him continue to be morally filthy. The one who
is righteous, let him continue to do what is righteous. The one who is holy, let him
continue to be holy.” 12 “Look! I am coming soon. My reward is with me, to pay
back each one according to what he has done. 13 I am the alpha and the omega, the
first and the last, the beginning and the end. 14 Blessed are those who wash their
robes so that they will have the right to eat from the tree of life and to enter the city
through the gates. * 15 Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the
murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches.
I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”
17 The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come!” Let the one who hears say, “Come!”
Whoever is thirsty, let him come, and whoever desires it, let him freely have the
water of life.
18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone
adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written about in this book.
19 If anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away
his share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are written about in this book. †
20 The one who testifies to these things says, “Yes! I am coming soon.” Amen! Come,
Lord Jesus!
21 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with everyone. Amen.
