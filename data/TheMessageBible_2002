1 The family tree of Jesus Christ,
David's son, Abraham's son:
2 Abraham had Isaac, Isaac had Jacob,
Jacob had Judah and his brothers,
3 Judah had Perez and Zerah (the
mother was Tamar), Perez had Hezron,
Hezron had Aram,
4 Aram had Amminadab, Amminadab
had Nahshon, Nahshon had Salmon,
5 Salmon had Boaz (his mother was
Rahab), Boaz had Obed (Ruth was the
mother), Obed had Jesse,
6 Jesse had David, and David became
king. David had Solomon (Uriah's wife
was the mother),
7 Solomon had Rehoboam, Rehoboam
had Abijah, Abijah had Asa,MATTHEW 1
2
8 Asa had Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat
had Joram, Joram had Uzziah,
9 Uzziah had Jotham, Jotham had Ahaz,
Ahaz had Hezekiah,
10 Hezekiah had Manasseh, Manasseh
had Amon, Amon had Josiah,
11 Josiah had Jehoiachin and his
brothers, and then the people were
taken into the Babylonian exile.
12 When the Babylonian exile ended,
Jehoiachin had Sheal el, Sheal el had
Zerubbabel,
13 Zerubbabel had Abiud, Abiud had
Eliakim, Eliakim had Azor,
14 Azor had Zadok, Zadok had Achim,
Achim had Eliud,
15 Eliud had Eleazar, Eleazar had
Ma han, Ma han had Jacob,
16 Jacob had Joseph, Mary's husband,
the Mary who gave birth to Jesus, the
Jesus who was called Christ.MATTHEW 1
17 There were fourteen genera
3
ons
from Abraham to David, another
fourteen from David to the Babylonian
exile, and yet another fourteen from the
Babylonian exile to Christ.
18 The birth of Jesus took place like this.
His mother, Mary, was engaged to be
married to Joseph. Before they came to
the marriage bed, Joseph discovered she
was pregnant. (It was by the Holy Spirit,
but he didn't know that.)
19 Joseph, chagrined but noble,
determined to take care of things quietly
so Mary would not be disgraced.
20 While he was trying to ﬁgure a way
out, he had a dream. God's angel spoke
in the dream: "Joseph, son of David,
don't hesitate to get married. Mary's
pregnancy is Spirit-conceived. God's
Holy Spirit has made her pregnant.
21 She will bring a son to birth, and
when she does, you, Joseph, will nameMATTHEW 1 – 2
4
him Jesus--'God saves'--because he will
save his people from their sins."
22 This would bring the prophet's
embryonic sermon to full term:
23 Watch for this--a virgin will get
pregnant and bear a son; They will name
him Emmanuel (Hebrew for "God is with
us").
24 Then Joseph woke up. He did exactly
what God's angel commanded in the
dream: He married Mary.
25 But he did not consummate the
marriage un l she had the baby. He
named the baby Jesus.
1 A er Jesus was born in Bethlehem
village, Judah territory--this was
during Herod's kingship--a band of
scholars arrived in Jerusalem from the
East.
2 They asked around, "Where can we
ﬁnd and pay homage to the newborn
King of the Jews? We observed a star in
2MATTHEW 2
5
the eastern sky that signaled his birth.
We're on pilgrimage to worship him."
3 When word of their inquiry got to
Herod, he was terriﬁed--and not Herod
alone, but most of Jerusalem as well.
4 Herod lost no me. He gathered all
the high priests and religion scholars in
the city together and asked, "Where is
the Messiah supposed to be born?"
5 They told him, "Bethlehem, Judah
territory. The prophet Micah wrote it
plainly:
6 It's you, Bethlehem, in Judah's land,
no longer bringing up the rear. From
you will come the leader who will
shepherd-rule my people, my Israel."
7 Herod then arranged a secret mee ng
with the scholars from the East.
Pretending to be as devout as they were,
he got them to tell him exactly when the
birth-announcement star appeared.MATTHEW 2
6
8 Then he told them the prophecy
about Bethlehem, and said, "Go ﬁnd this
child. Leave no stone unturned. As soon
as you ﬁnd him, send word and I'll join
you at once in your worship."
9 Instructed by the king, they set oﬀ.
Then the star appeared again, the same
star they had seen in the eastern skies.
It led them on un l it hovered over the
place of the child.
10 They could hardly contain
themselves: They were in the right
place! They had arrived at the right me!
11 They entered the house and saw the
child in the arms of Mary, his mother.
Overcome, they kneeled and worshiped
him. Then they opened their luggage
and presented gi s: gold, frankincense,
myrrh.
12 In a dream, they were warned not to
report back to Herod. So they worked
out another route, le the territoryMATTHEW 2
7
without being seen, and returned to
their own country.
13 A er the scholars were gone, God's
angel showed up again in Joseph's dream
and commanded, "Get up. Take the child
and his mother and ﬂee to Egypt. Stay
un l further no ce. Herod is on the hunt
for this child, and wants to kill him."
14 Joseph obeyed. He got up, took the
child and his mother under cover of
darkness. They were out of town and
well on their way by daylight.
15 They lived in Egypt un l Herod's
death. This Egyp an exile fulﬁlled what
Hosea had preached: "I called my son
out of Egypt."
16 Herod, when he realized that the
scholars had tricked him, ﬂew into
a rage. He commanded the murder
of every li le boy two years old and
under who lived in Bethlehem and its
surrounding hills. (He determined thatMATTHEW 2
8
age from informa on he'd go en from
the scholars.)
17 That's when Jeremiah's sermon was
fulﬁlled:
18 A sound was heard in Ramah,
weeping and much lament. Rachel
weeping for her children, Rachel refusing
all solace, Her children gone, dead and
buried.
19 Later, when Herod died, God's angel
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt:
20 "Up, take the child and his mother
and return to Israel. All those out to
murder the child are dead."
21 Joseph obeyed. He got up, took the
child and his mother, and reentered
Israel.
22 When he heard, though, that
Archelaus had succeeded his father,
Herod, as king in Judea, he was afraid to
go there. But then Joseph was directed
in a dream to go to the hills of Galilee.MATTHEW 2 – 3
23 On arrival, he se
9
led in the village of
Nazareth. This move was a fulﬁllment of
the prophe c words, "He shall be called
a Nazarene."
1 While Jesus was living in the
Galilean hills, John, called "the
Bap zer," was preaching in the desert
country of Judea.
2 His message was simple and austere,
like his desert surroundings: "Change
your life. God's kingdom is here."
3 John and his message were authorized
by Isaiah's prophecy: Thunder in the
desert! Prepare for God's arrival! Make
the road smooth and straight!
4 John dressed in a camel-hair habit ed
at the waist by a leather strap. He lived
on a diet of locusts and wild ﬁeld honey.
5 People poured out of Jerusalem,
Judea, and the Jordanian countryside to
hear and see him in ac on.
3MATTHEW 3
10
6 There at the Jordan River those who
came to confess their sins were bap zed
into a changed life.
7 When John realized that a lot of
Pharisees and Sadducees were showing
up for a bap smal experience because it
was becoming the popular thing to do,
he exploded: "Brood of snakes! What do
you think you're doing slithering down
here to the river? Do you think a li le
water on your snakeskins is going to
make any diﬀerence?
8 It's your life that must change, not
your skin!
9 And don't think you can pull rank
by claiming Abraham as father. Being a
descendant of Abraham is neither here
nor there. Descendants of Abraham are
a dime a dozen.
10 What counts is your life. Is it
green and blossoming? Because if it's
deadwood, it goes on the ﬁre.MATTHEW 3
11 "I'm bap
11
zing you here in the river,
turning your old life in for a kingdom life.
The real ac on comes next: The main
character in this drama--compared to
him I'm a mere stagehand--will ignite
the kingdom life within you, a ﬁre within
you, the Holy Spirit within you, changing
you from the inside out.
12 He's going to clean house--make a
clean sweep of your lives. He'll place
everything true in its proper place before
God; everything false he'll put out with
the trash to be burned."
13 Jesus then appeared, arriving at the
Jordan River from Galilee. He wanted
John to bap ze him.
14 John objected, "I'm the one who
needs to be bap zed, not you!"
15 But Jesus insisted. "Do it. God's work,
pu ng things right all these centuries,
is coming together right now in this
bap sm." So John did it.MATTHEW 3 – 4
12
16 The moment Jesus came up out of
the bap smal waters, the skies opened
up and he saw God's Spirit--it looked like
a dove--descending and landing on him.
17 And along with the Spirit, a voice:
"This is my Son, chosen and marked by
my love, delight of my life."
1 Next Jesus was taken into the wild
by the Spirit for the Test. The Devil
was ready to give it.
2 Jesus prepared for the Test by fas ng
forty days and forty nights. That le him,
of course, in a state of extreme hunger,
3 which the Devil took advantage of
in the ﬁrst test: "Since you are God's
Son, speak the word that will turn these
stones into loaves of bread."
4 Jesus answered by quo ng
Deuteronomy: "It takes more than
bread to stay alive. It takes a steady
stream of words from God's mouth."
4MATTHEW 4
13
5 For the second test the Devil took him
to the Holy City. He sat him on top of the
Temple and said,
6 "Since you are God's Son, jump." The
Devil goaded him by quo ng Psalm 91:
"He has placed you in the care of angels.
They will catch you so that you won't so
much as stub your toe on a stone."
7 Jesus countered with another cita on
from Deuteronomy: "Don't you dare test
the Lord your God."
8 For the third test, the Devil took him
on the peak of a huge mountain. He
gestured expansively, poin ng out all
the earth's kingdoms, how glorious they
all were.
9 Then he said, "They're yours--lock,
stock, and barrel. Just go down on your
knees and worship me, and they're
yours."
10 Jesus' refusal was curt: "Beat it,
Satan!" He backed his rebuke with a thirdMATTHEW 4
14
quota on from Deuteronomy: "Worship
the Lord your God, and only him. Serve
him with absolute single-heartedness."
11 The Test was over. The Devil le . And
in his place, angels! Angels came and
took care of Jesus' needs.
12 When Jesus got word that John had
been arrested, he returned to Galilee.
13 He moved from his hometown,
Nazareth, to the lakeside village
Capernaum, nestled at the base of the
Zebulun and Naphtali hills.
14 This move completed Isaiah's
sermon:
15 Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali,
road to the sea, over Jordan, Galilee,
crossroads for the na ons.
16 People si ng out their lives in the
dark saw a huge light; Si ng in that dark,
dark country of death, they watched the
sun come up.MATTHEW 4
15
17 This Isaiah-prophesied sermon came
to life in Galilee the moment Jesus
started preaching. He picked up where
John le oﬀ: "Change your life. God's
kingdom is here."
18 Walking along the beach of Lake
Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers: Simon
(later called Peter) and Andrew. They
were ﬁshing, throwing their nets into
the lake. It was their regular work.
19 Jesus said to them, "Come with me.
I'll make a new kind of ﬁsherman out of
you. I'll show you how to catch men and
women instead of perch and bass."
20 They didn't ask ques ons, but simply
dropped their nets and followed.
21 A short distance down the beach they
came upon another pair of brothers,
James and John, Zebedee's sons. These
two were si ng in a boat with their
father, Zebedee, mending their ﬁshnets.
Jesus made the same oﬀer to them,MATTHEW 4
16
22 and they were just as quick to follow,
abandoning boat and father.
23 From there he went all over Galilee.
He used synagogues for mee ng places
and taught people the truth of God.
God's kingdom was his theme--that
beginning right now they were under
God's government, a good government!
He also healed people of their diseases
and of the bad eﬀects of their bad lives.
24 Word got around the en re Roman
province of Syria. People brought
anybody with an ailment, whether
mental, emo onal, or physical. Jesus
healed them, one and all.
25 More and more people came, the
momentum gathering. Besides those
from Galilee, crowds came from the "Ten
Towns" across the lake, others up from
Jerusalem and Judea, s ll others from
across the Jordan.MATTHEW 5
5
17
1 When Jesus saw his ministry
drawing huge crowds, he climbed a
hillside. Those who were appren ced to
him, the commi ed, climbed with him.
Arriving at a quiet place, he sat down
2 and taught his climbing companions.
This is what he said:
3 "You're blessed when you're at the
end of your rope. With less of you there
is more of God and his rule.
4 "You're blessed when you feel you've
lost what is most dear to you. Only then
can you be embraced by the One most
dear to you.
5 "You're blessed when you're content
with just who you are--no more, no less.
That's the moment you ﬁnd yourselves
proud owners of everything that can't
be bought.
6 "You're blessed when you've worked
up a good appe te for God. He's foodMATTHEW 5
18
and drink in the best meal you'll ever
eat.
7 "You're blessed when you care. At
the moment of being 'carefull,' you ﬁnd
yourselves cared for.
8 "You're blessed when you get your
inside world--your mind and heart--put
right. Then you can see God in the
outside world.
9 "You're blessed when you can show
people how to cooperate instead of
compete or ﬁght. That's when you
discover who you really are, and your
place in God's family.
10 "You're blessed when your
commitment to God provokes
persecu on. The persecu on drives you
even deeper into God's kingdom.
11 "Not only that--count yourselves
blessed every me people put you down
or throw you out or speak lies about you
to discredit me. What it means is thatMATTHEW 5
19
the truth is too close for comfort and
they are uncomfortable.
12 You can be glad when that happens-
-give a cheer, even!--for though they
don't like it, I do! And all heaven
applauds. And know that you are in good
company. My prophets and witnesses
have always go en into this kind of
trouble.
13 "Let me tell you why you are here.
You're here to be salt-seasoning that
brings out the God-ﬂavors of this earth.
If you lose your sal ness, how will
people taste godliness? You've lost
your usefulness and will end up in the
garbage.
14 "Here's another way to put it:
You're here to be light, bringing out the
God-colors in the world. God is not a
secret to be kept. We're going public
with this, as public as a city on a hill.MATTHEW 5
20
15 If I make you light-bearers, you don't
think I'm going to hide you under a
bucket, do you? I'm pu ng you on a
light stand.
16 Now that I've put you there on a
hilltop, on a light stand--shine! Keep
open house; be generous with your
lives. By opening up to others, you'll
prompt people to open up with God, this
generous Father in heaven.
17 "Don't suppose for a minute that I
have come to demolish the Scriptures-
-either God's Law or the Prophets. I'm
not here to demolish but to complete. I
am going to put it all together, pull it all
together in a vast panorama.
18 God's Law is more real and las ng
than the stars in the sky and the ground
at your feet. Long a er stars burn out
and earth wears out, God's Law will be
alive and working.MATTHEW 5
21
19 "Trivialize even the smallest item
in God's Law and you will only have
trivialized yourself. But take it seriously,
show the way for others, and you will
ﬁnd honor in the kingdom.
20 Unless you do far be er than the
Pharisees in the ma ers of right living,
you won't know the ﬁrst thing about
entering the kingdom.
21 "You're familiar with the command
to the ancients, 'Do not murder.'
22 I'm telling you that anyone who is so
much as angry with a brother or sister is
guilty of murder. Carelessly call a brother
'idiot!' and you just might ﬁnd yourself
hauled into court. Thoughtlessly yell
'stupid!' at a sister and you are on the
brink of hellﬁre. The simple moral fact is
that words kill.
23 "This is how I want you to conduct
yourself in these ma ers. If you enter
your place of worship and, aboutMATTHEW 5
22
to make an oﬀering, you suddenly
remember a grudge a friend has against
you,
24 abandon your oﬀering, leave
immediately, go to this friend and make
things right. Then and only then, come
back and work things out with God.
25 "Or say you're out on the street and
an old enemy accosts you. Don't lose
a minute. Make the ﬁrst move; make
things right with him. A er all, if you
leave the ﬁrst move to him, knowing his
track record, you're likely to end up in
court, maybe even jail.
26 If that happens, you won't get out
without a s ﬀ ﬁne.
27 "You know the next commandment
pre y well, too: 'Don't go to bed with
another's spouse.'
28 But don't think you've preserved
your virtue simply by staying out of bed.
Your heart can be corrupted by lust evenMATTHEW 5
23
quicker than your body. Those leering
looks you think nobody no ces--they
also corrupt.
29 "Let's not pretend this is easier than
it really is. If you want to live a morally
pure life, here's what you have to do:
You have to blind your right eye the
moment you catch it in a lus ul leer. You
have to choose to live one-eyed or else
be dumped on a moral trash pile.
30 And you have to chop oﬀ your right
hand the moment you no ce it raised
threateningly. Be er a bloody stump
than your en re being discarded for
good in the dump.
31 "Remember the Scripture that says,
'Whoever divorces his wife, let him do it
legally, giving her divorce papers and her
legal rights'?
32 Too many of you are using that
as a cover for selﬁshness and whim,
pretending to be righteous just becauseMATTHEW 5
24
you are 'legal.' Please, no more
pretending. If you divorce your wife,
you're responsible for making her an
adulteress (unless she has already made
herself that by sexual promiscuity). And
if you marry such a divorced adulteress,
you're automa cally an adulterer
yourself. You can't use legal cover to
mask a moral failure.
33 "And don't say anything you don't
mean. This counsel is embedded deep in
our tradi ons.
34 You only make things worse when
you lay down a smoke screen of pious
talk, saying, 'I'll pray for you,' and never
doing it, or saying, 'God be with you,'
and not meaning it. You don't make your
words true by embellishing them with
religious lace. In making your speech
sound more religious, it becomes less
true.MATTHEW 5
25
37 Just say 'yes' and 'no.' When you
manipulate words to get your own way,
you go wrong.
38 "Here's another old saying that
deserves a second look: 'Eye for eye,
tooth for tooth.'
39 Is that going to get us anywhere?
Here's what I propose: 'Don't hit back at
all.' If someone strikes you, stand there
and take it.
40 If someone drags you into court and
sues for the shirt oﬀ your back, gi wrap
your best coat and make a present of it.
41 And if someone takes unfair
advantage of you, use the occasion to
prac ce the servant life.
42 No more t-for-tat stuﬀ. Live
generously.
43 "You're familiar with the old wri en
law, 'Love your friend,' and its unwri en
companion, 'Hate your enemy.'MATTHEW 5
26
44 I'm challenging that. I'm telling you
to love your enemies. Let them bring
out the best in you, not the worst. When
someone gives you a hard me, respond
with the energies of prayer,
45 for then you are working out of your
true selves, your God-created selves.
This is what God does. He gives his
best--the sun to warm and the rain to
nourish--to everyone, regardless: the
good and bad, the nice and nasty.
46 If all you do is love the lovable, do
you expect a bonus? Anybody can do
that.
47 If you simply say hello to those who
greet you, do you expect a medal? Any
run-of-the-mill sinner does that.
48 "In a word, what I'm saying is, Grow
up. You're kingdom subjects. Now live
like it. Live out your God-created iden ty.
Live generously and graciously toward
others, the way God lives toward you.MATTHEW 6
6
27
1 "Be especially careful when you are
trying to be good so that you don't
make a performance out of it. It might
be good theater, but the God who made
you won't be applauding.
2 "When you do something for
someone else, don't call a en on to
yourself. You've seen them in ac on, I'm
sure--'playactors' I call them--trea ng
prayer mee ng and street corner alike
as a stage, ac ng compassionate as long
as someone is watching, playing to the
crowds. They get applause, true, but
that's all they get.
3 When you help someone out, don't
think about how it looks.
4 Just do it--quietly and unobtrusively.
That is the way your God, who conceived
you in love, working behind the scenes,
helps you out.
5 "And when you come before God,
don't turn that into a theatricalMATTHEW 6
28
produc on either. All these people
making a regular show out of their
prayers, hoping for stardom! Do you
think God sits in a box seat?
6 "Here's what I want you to do: Find
a quiet, secluded place so you won't be
tempted to role-play before God. Just be
there as simply and honestly as you can
manage. The focus will shi from you
to God, and you will begin to sense his
grace.
7 "The world is full of so-called prayer
warriors who are prayer-ignorant.
They're full of formulas and programs
and advice, peddling techniques for
ge ng what you want from God.
8 Don't fall for that nonsense. This is
your Father you are dealing with, and he
knows be er than you what you need.
9 With a God like this loving you, you
can pray very simply. Like this: Our
Father in heaven, Reveal who you are.MATTHEW 6
29
10 Set the world right; Do what's
best--as above, so below.
11 Keep us alive with three square
meals.
12 Keep us forgiven with you and
forgiving others.
13 Keep us safe from ourselves and
the Devil. You're in charge! You can do
anything you want! You're ablaze in
beauty! Yes. Yes. Yes.
14 "In prayer there is a connec on
between what God does and what you
do. You can't get forgiveness from God,
for instance, without also forgiving
others.
15 If you refuse to do your part, you cut
yourself oﬀ from God's part.
16 "When you prac ce some appe te-
denying discipline to be er concentrate
on God, don't make a produc on out of
it. It might turn you into a small- me
celebrity but it won't make you a saint.MATTHEW 6
30
17 If you 'go into training' inwardly, act
normal outwardly. Shampoo and comb
your hair, brush your teeth, wash your
face.
18 God doesn't require a en on-ge ng
devices. He won't overlook what you are
doing; he'll reward you well.
19 "Don't hoard treasure down here
where it gets eaten by moths and
corroded by rust or--worse!--stolen by
burglars.
20 Stockpile treasure in heaven, where
it's safe from moth and rust and burglars.
21 It's obvious, isn't it? The place where
your treasure is, is the place you will
most want to be, and end up being.
22 "Your eyes are windows into your
body. If you open your eyes wide in
wonder and belief, your body ﬁlls up
with light.
23 If you live squinty-eyed in greed and
distrust, your body is a dank cellar. If youMATTHEW 6
31
pull the blinds on your windows, what a
dark life you will have!
24 "You can't worship two gods at once.
Loving one god, you'll end up ha ng the
other. Adora on of one feeds contempt
for the other. You can't worship God and
Money both.
25 "If you decide for God, living a life
of God-worship, it follows that you
don't fuss about what's on the table at
meal mes or whether the clothes in
your closet are in fashion. There is far
more to your life than the food you put
in your stomach, more to your outer
appearance than the clothes you hang
on your body.
26 Look at the birds, free and
unfe ered, not ed down to a job
descrip on, careless in the care of God.
And you count far more to him than
birds.MATTHEW 6
32
27 "Has anyone by fussing in front of the
mirror ever go en taller by so much as
an inch?
28 All this me and money wasted on
fashion--do you think it makes that
much diﬀerence? Instead of looking at
the fashions, walk out into the ﬁelds
and look at the wildﬂowers. They never
primp or shop,
29 but have you ever seen color and
design quite like it? The ten best-dressed
men and women in the country look
shabby alongside them.
30 "If God gives such a en on to the
appearance of wildﬂowers--most of
which are never even seen--don't you
think he'll a end to you, take pride in
you, do his best for you?
31 What I'm trying to do here is to get
you to relax, to not be so preoccupied
with ge ng, so you can respond to
God's giving.MATTHEW 6 – 7
33
32 People who don't know God and the
way he works fuss over these things, but
you know both God and how he works.
33 Steep your life in God-reality,
God-ini a ve, God-provisions. Don't
worry about missing out. You'll ﬁnd all
your everyday human concerns will be
met.
34 "Give your en re a en on to what
God is doing right now, and don't get
worked up about what may or may not
happen tomorrow. God will help you
deal with whatever hard things come up
when the me comes.
1 "Don't pick on people, jump
on their failures, cri cize their
faults--unless, of course, you want the
same treatment.
2 That cri cal spirit has a way of
boomeranging.
7MATTHEW 7
34
3 It's easy to see a smudge on your
neighbor's face and be oblivious to the
ugly sneer on your own.
4 Do you have the nerve to say, 'Let me
wash your face for you,' when your own
face is distorted by contempt?
5 It's this whole traveling road-show
mentality all over again, playing a
holier-than-thou part instead of just
living your part. Wipe that ugly sneer oﬀ
your own face, and you might be ﬁt to
oﬀer a washcloth to your neighbor.
6 "Don't be ﬂip with the sacred. Banter
and silliness give no honor to God. Don't
reduce holy mysteries to slogans. In
trying to be relevant, you're only being
cute and invi ng sacrilege.
7 "Don't bargain with God. Be direct.
Ask for what you need.
8 This isn't a cat-and-mouse, hide-and-
seek game we're in.MATTHEW 7
35
9 If your child asks for bread, do you
trick him with sawdust?
10 If he asks for ﬁsh, do you scare him
with a live snake on his plate?
11 As bad as you are, you wouldn't think
of such a thing. You're at least decent to
your own children. So don't you think
the God who conceived you in love will
be even be er?
12 "Here is a simple, rule-of-thumb
guide for behavior: Ask yourself what
you want people to do for you, then grab
the ini a ve and do it for them. Add up
God's Law and Prophets and this is what
you get.
13 "Don't look for shortcuts to God.
The market is ﬂooded with sureﬁre,
easygoing formulas for a successful life
that can be prac ced in your spare me.
Don't fall for that stuﬀ, even though
crowds of people do.MATTHEW 7
36
14 The way to life--to God!--is vigorous
and requires total a en on.
15 "Be wary of false preachers who
smile a lot, dripping with prac ced
sincerity. Chances are they are out to
rip you oﬀ some way or other. Don't
be impressed with charisma; look for
character.
16 Who preachers are is the main thing,
not what they say. A genuine leader will
never exploit your emo ons or your
pocketbook. These diseased trees with
their bad apples are going to be chopped
down and burned.
21 "Knowing the correct password--
saying 'Master, Master,' for instance-
-isn't going to get you anywhere
with me. What is required is serious
obedience--doing what my Father wills.
22 I can see it now--at the Final
Judgment thousands stru ng up to me
and saying, 'Master, we preached theMATTHEW 7
37
Message, we bashed the demons, our
God-sponsored projects had everyone
talking.'
23 And do you know what I am going
to say? 'You missed the boat. All you
did was use me to make yourselves
important. You don't impress me one
bit. You're out of here.'
24 "These words I speak to you are
not incidental addi ons to your life,
homeowner improvements to your
standard of living. They are founda onal
words, words to build a life on. If you
work these words into your life, you
are like a smart carpenter who built his
house on solid rock.
25 Rain poured down, the river ﬂooded,
a tornado hit--but nothing moved that
house. It was ﬁxed to the rock.
26 "But if you just use my words in Bible
studies and don't work them into yourMATTHEW 7 – 8
38
life, you are like a stupid carpenter who
built his house on the sandy beach.
27 When a storm rolled in and the
waves came up, it collapsed like a house
of cards."
28 When Jesus concluded his address,
the crowd burst into applause. They had
never heard teaching like this.
29 It was apparent that he was living
everything he was saying--quite a
contrast to their religion teachers! This
was the best teaching they had ever
heard.
1 Jesus came down the mountain
with the cheers of the crowd s ll
ringing in his ears.
2 Then a leper appeared and went to
his knees before Jesus, praying, "Master,
if you want to, you can heal my body."
3 Jesus reached out and touched him,
saying, "I want to. Be clean." Then and
there, all signs of the leprosy were gone.
8MATTHEW 8
39
4 Jesus said, "Don't talk about this all
over town. Just quietly present your
healed body to the priest, along with
the appropriate expressions of thanks to
God. Your cleansed and grateful life, not
your words, will bear witness to what I
have done."
5 As Jesus entered the village of
Capernaum, a Roman captain came up
in a panic and said,
6 "Master, my servant is sick. He can't
walk. He's in terrible pain."
7 Jesus said, "I'll come and heal him."
8 "Oh, no," said the captain. "I don't
want to put you to all that trouble. Just
give the order and my servant will be
ﬁne.
9 I'm a man who takes orders and gives
orders. I tell one soldier, 'Go,' and he
goes; to another, 'Come,' and he comes;
to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."MATTHEW 8
40
10 Taken aback, Jesus said, "I've yet to
come across this kind of simple trust in
Israel, the very people who are supposed
to know all about God and how he
works.
11 This man is the vanguard of many
outsiders who will soon be coming
from all direc ons--streaming in from
the east, pouring in from the west,
si ng down at God's kingdom banquet
alongside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
12 Then those who grew up 'in the faith'
but had no faith will ﬁnd themselves
out in the cold, outsiders to grace and
wondering what happened."
13 Then Jesus turned to the captain
and said, "Go. What you believed could
happen has happened." At that moment
his servant became well.
14 By this me they were in front
of Peter's house. On entering, JesusMATTHEW 8
41
found Peter's mother-in-law sick in bed,
burning up with fever.
15 He touched her hand and the fever
was gone. No sooner was she up on her
feet than she was ﬁxing dinner for him.
16 That evening a lot of demon-aﬄicted
people were brought to him. He relieved
the inwardly tormented. He cured the
bodily ill.
17 He fulﬁlled Isaiah's well-known
sermon: He took our illnesses, He carried
our diseases.
18 When Jesus saw that a curious crowd
was growing by the minute, he told his
disciples to get him out of there to the
other side of the lake.
19 As they le , a religion scholar asked
if he could go along. "I'll go with you,
wherever," he said.
20 Jesus was curt: "Are you ready to
rough it? We're not staying in the best
inns, you know."MATTHEW 8
42
21 Another follower said, "Master,
excuse me for a couple of days, please. I
have my father's funeral to take care of."
22 Jesus refused. "First things ﬁrst. Your
business is life, not death. Follow me.
Pursue life."
23 Then he got in the boat, his disciples
with him.
24 The next thing they knew, they were
in a severe storm. Waves were crashing
into the boat--and he was sound asleep!
25 They roused him, pleading, "Master,
save us! We're going down!"
26 Jesus reprimanded them. "Why are
you such cowards, such faint-hearts?"
Then he stood up and told the wind to be
silent, the sea to quiet down: "Silence!"
The sea became smooth as glass.
27 The men rubbed their eyes,
astonished. "What's going on here?
Wind and sea come to heel at his
command!"MATTHEW 8
43
28 They landed in the country of
the Gadarenes and were met by two
madmen, vic ms of demons, coming
out of the cemetery. The men had
terrorized the region for so long that no
one considered it safe to walk down that
stretch of road anymore.
29 Seeing Jesus, the madmen screamed
out, "What business do you have giving
us a hard me? You're the Son of God!
You weren't supposed to show up here
yet!"
30 Oﬀ in the distance a herd of pigs was
browsing and roo ng.
31 The evil spirits begged Jesus, "If you
kick us out of these men, let us live in
the pigs."
32 Jesus said, "Go ahead, but get out of
here!" Crazed, the pigs stampeded over
a cliﬀ into the sea and drowned.
33 Scared to death, the swineherds
bolted. They told everyone back in townMATTHEW 8 – 9
44
what had happened to the madmen and
the pigs.
34 Those who heard about it were angry
about the drowned pigs. A mob formed
and demanded that Jesus get out and
not come back.
1 Back in the boat, Jesus and the
disciples recrossed the sea to Jesus'
hometown.
2 They were hardly out of the boat
when some men carried a paraplegic on
a stretcher and set him down in front
of them. Jesus, impressed by their bold
belief, said to the paraplegic, "Cheer up,
son. I forgive your sins."
3 Some religion scholars whispered,
"Why, that's blasphemy!"
4 Jesus knew what they were thinking,
and said, "Why this gossipy whispering?
5 Which do you think is simpler: to say, 'I
forgive your sins,' or, 'Get up and walk'?
9MATTHEW 9
45
6 Well, just so it's clear that I'm the
Son of Man and authorized to do either,
or both. ..."At this he turned to the
paraplegic and said, "Get up. Take your
bed and go home."
7 And the man did it.
8 The crowd was awestruck, amazed
and pleased that God had authorized
Jesus to work among them this way.
9 Passing along, Jesus saw a man at
his work collec ng taxes. His name was
Ma hew. Jesus said, "Come along with
me." Ma hew stood up and followed
him.
10 Later when Jesus was ea ng
supper at Ma hew's house with his
close followers, a lot of disreputable
characters came and joined them.
11 When the Pharisees saw him keeping
this kind of company, they had a ﬁt, and
lit into Jesus' followers. "What kind ofMATTHEW 9
46
example is this from your Teacher, ac ng
cozy with crooks and riﬀ-raﬀ?"
12 Jesus, overhearing, shot back, "Who
needs a doctor: the healthy or the sick?
13 Go ﬁgure out what this Scripture
means: 'I'm a er mercy, not religion.'
I'm here to invite outsiders, not coddle
insiders."
14 A li le later John's followers
approached, asking, "Why is it that we
and the Pharisees rigorously discipline
body and spirit by fas ng, but your
followers don't?"
15 Jesus told them, "When you're
celebra ng a wedding, you don't skimp
on the cake and wine. You feast. Later
you may need to pull in your belt, but
not now. No one throws cold water on a
friendly bonﬁre. This is Kingdom Come!"
16 He went on, "No one cuts up a ﬁne
silk scarf to patch old work clothes; you
want fabrics that match.MATTHEW 9
47
17 And you don't put your wine in
cracked bo les."
18 As he ﬁnished saying this, a local
oﬃcial appeared, bowed politely, and
said, "My daughter has just now died. If
you come and touch her, she will live."
19 Jesus got up and went with him, his
disciples following along.
20 Just then a woman who had
hemorrhaged for twelve years slipped
in from behind and lightly touched his
robe.
21 She was thinking to herself, "If I can
just put a ﬁnger on his robe, I'll get well."
Jesus turned--caught her at it. Then he
reassured her: "Courage, daughter. You
took a risk of faith, and now you're well."
22 The woman was well from then on.
23 By now they had arrived at the house
of the town oﬃcial, and pushed their
way through the gossips looking forMATTHEW 9
48
a story and the neighbors bringing in
casseroles.
24 Jesus was abrupt: "Clear out! This
girl isn't dead. She's sleeping." They told
him he didn't know what he was talking
about.
25 But when Jesus had go en rid of the
crowd, he went in, took the girl's hand,
and pulled her to her feet--alive.
26 The news was soon out, and traveled
throughout the region.
27 As Jesus le the house, he was
followed by two blind men crying out,
"Mercy, Son of David! Mercy on us!"
28 When Jesus got home, the blind men
went in with him. Jesus said to them,
"Do you really believe I can do this?"
They said, "Why, yes, Master!"
29 He touched their eyes and said,
"Become what you believe."MATTHEW 9
49
30 It happened. They saw. Then Jesus
became very stern. "Don't let a soul
know how this happened."
31 But they were hardly out the door
before they started blabbing it to
everyone they met.
32 Right a er that, as the blind men
were leaving, a man who had been
struck speechless by an evil spirit was
brought to Jesus.
33 As soon as Jesus threw the evil
tormen ng spirit out, the man talked
away just as if he'd been talking all
his life. The people were up on their
feet applauding: "There's never been
anything like this in Israel!"
34 The Pharisees were le spu ering,
"Hocus pocus. It's nothing but hocus
pocus. He's probably made a pact with
the Devil."
35 Then Jesus made a circuit of all the
towns and villages. He taught in theirMATTHEW 9 – 10
50
mee ng places, reported kingdom news,
and healed their diseased bodies, healed
their bruised and hurt lives.
36 When he looked out over the crowds,
his heart broke. So confused and aimless
they were, like sheep with no shepherd.
37 "What a huge harvest!" he said to his
disciples. "How few workers!
38 On your knees and pray for harvest
hands!"
1 The prayer was no sooner
prayed than it was answered.
Jesus called twelve of his followers and
sent them into the ripe ﬁelds. He gave
them power to kick out the evil spirits
and to tenderly care for the bruised and
hurt lives.
2 This is the list of the twelve he sent:
Simon (they called him Peter, or "Rock"),
Andrew, his brother, James, Zebedee's
son, John, his brother,
10MATTHEW 10
51
3 Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas,
Ma hew, the tax man, James, son of
Alphaeus, Thaddaeus,
4 Simon, the Canaanite, Judas Iscariot
(who later turned on him).
5 Jesus sent his twelve harvest hands
out with this charge: "Don't begin by
traveling to some far-oﬀ place to convert
unbelievers. And don't try to be drama c
by tackling some public enemy.
6 Go to the lost, confused people right
here in the neighborhood.
7 Tell them that the kingdom is here.
8 Bring health to the sick. Raise the
dead. Touch the untouchables. Kick out
the demons. You have been treated
generously, so live generously.
9 "Don't think you have to put on a
fund-raising campaign before you start.
10 You don't need a lot of equipment.
You are the equipment, and all you needMATTHEW 10
52
to keep that going is three meals a day.
Travel light.
11 "When you enter a town or village,
don't insist on staying in a luxury inn.
Get a modest place with some modest
people, and be content there un l you
leave.
12 "When you knock on a door, be
courteous in your gree ng.
13 If they welcome you, be gentle in
your conversa on.
14 If they don't welcome you, quietly
withdraw. Don't make a scene. Shrug
your shoulders and be on your way.
15 You can be sure that on Judgment
Day they'll be mighty sorry--but it's no
concern of yours now.
16 "Stay alert. This is hazardous work
I'm assigning you. You're going to be
like sheep running through a wolf pack,
so don't call a en on to yourselves. BeMATTHEW 10
53
as cunning as a snake, inoﬀensive as a
dove.
17 "Don't be naive. Some people will
impugn your mo ves, others will smear
your reputa on--just because you
believe in me.
18 Don't be upset when they haul you
before the civil authori es. Without
knowing it, they've done you--and me--a
favor, given you a pla orm for preaching
the kingdom news!
19 And don't worry about what you'll
say or how you'll say it. The right words
will be there;
20 the Spirit of your Father will supply
the words.
21 "When people realize it is the living
God you are presen ng and not some
idol that makes them feel good, they
are going to turn on you, even people in
your own family.MATTHEW 10
54
22 There is a great irony here:
proclaiming so much love, experiencing
so much hate! But don't quit. Don't cave
in. It is all well worth it in the end.
23 It is not success you are a er in such
mes but survival. Be survivors! Before
you've run out of op ons, the Son of
Man will have arrived.
24 "A student doesn't get a be er desk
than her teacher. A laborer doesn't make
more money than his boss.
25 Be content--pleased, even--when
you, my students, my harvest hands, get
the same treatment I get. If they call me,
the Master, 'Dungface,' what can the
workers expect?
26 "Don't be in midated. Eventually
everything is going to be out in the open,
and everyone will know how things
really are.
27 So don't hesitate to go public now.MATTHEW 10
55
28 "Don't be bluﬀed into silence by the
threats of bullies. There's nothing they
can do to your soul, your core being.
Save your fear for God, who holds your
en re life--body and soul--in his hands.
29 "What's the price of a pet canary?
Some loose change, right? And God
cares what happens to it even more than
you do.
30 He pays even greater a en on
to you, down to the last detail--even
numbering the hairs on your head!
31 So don't be in midated by all this
bully talk. You're worth more than a
million canaries.
32 "Stand up for me against world
opinion and I'll stand up for you before
my Father in heaven.
33 If you turn tail and run, do you think
I'll cover for you?
34 "Don't think I've come to make life
cozy. I've come to cut--MATTHEW 10
56
35 make a sharp knife-cut between son
and father, daughter and mother, bride
and mother-in-law--cut through these
cozy domes c arrangements and free
you for God.
36 Well-meaning family members can
be your worst enemies.
37 If you prefer father or mother over
me, you don't deserve me. If you prefer
son or daughter over me, you don't
deserve me.
38 "If you don't go all the way with
me, through thick and thin, you don't
deserve me.
39 If your ﬁrst concern is to look a er
yourself, you'll never ﬁnd yourself. But
if you forget about yourself and look to
me, you'll ﬁnd both yourself and me.
40 "We are in mately linked in this
harvest work. Anyone who accepts what
you do, accepts me, the One who sentMATTHEW 10 – 11
57
you. Anyone who accepts what I do
accepts my Father, who sent me.
41 Accep ng a messenger of God is
as good as being God's messenger.
Accep ng someone's help is as good
as giving someone help. This is a large
work I've called you into, but don't be
overwhelmed by it. It's best to start
small.
42 Give a cool cup of water to someone
who is thirsty, for instance. The smallest
act of giving or receiving makes you a
true appren ce. You won't lose out on a
thing."
1 When Jesus ﬁnished placing
this charge before his twelve
disciples, he went on to teach and
preach in their villages.
2 John, meanwhile, had been locked
up in prison. When he got wind of
what Jesus was doing, he sent his own
disciples
11MATTHEW 11
58
3 to ask, "Are you the One we've been
expec ng, or are we s ll wai ng?"
4 Jesus told them, "Go back and tell
John what's going on:
5 The blind see, The lame walk, Lepers
are cleansed, The deaf hear, The dead
are raised, The wretched of the earth
learn that God is on their side.
6 "Is this what you were expec ng?
Then count yourselves most blessed!"
7 When John's disciples le to report,
Jesus started talking to the crowd about
John. "What did you expect when you
went out to see him in the wild? A
weekend camper?
8 Hardly. What then? A sheik in silk
pajamas? Not in the wilderness, not by a
long shot.
9 What then? A prophet? That's right,
a prophet! Probably the best prophet
you'll ever hear.MATTHEW 11
59
10 He is the prophet that Malachi
announced when he wrote, 'I'm sending
my prophet ahead of you, to make the
road smooth for you.'
11 "Let me tell you what's going on
here: No one in history surpasses John
the Bap zer; but in the kingdom he
prepared you for, the lowliest person is
ahead of him.
12 For a long me now people have
tried to force themselves into God's
kingdom.
13 But if you read the books of the
Prophets and God's Law closely, you will
see them culminate in John, teaming up
with him in preparing the way for the
Messiah of the kingdom.
14 Looked at in this way, John is the
'Elijah' you've all been expec ng to
arrive and introduce the Messiah.
15 "Are you listening to me? Really
listening?MATTHEW 11
60
16 "How can I account for this
genera on? The people have been
like spoiled children whining to their
parents,
17 'We wanted to skip rope, and you
were always too red; we wanted to
talk, but you were always too busy.'
18 John came fas ng and they called
him crazy.
19 I came feas ng and they called me
a lush, a friend of the riﬀ-raﬀ. Opinion
polls don't count for much, do they? The
proof of the pudding is in the ea ng."
20 Next Jesus let ﬂy on the ci es
where he had worked the hardest but
whose people had responded the least,
shrugging their shoulders and going
their own way.
21 "Doom to you, Chorazin! Doom,
Bethsaida! If Tyre and Sidon had seen
half of the powerful miracles you haveMATTHEW 11
61
seen, they would have been on their
knees in a minute.
22 At Judgment Day they'll get oﬀ easy
compared to you.
23 And Capernaum! With all your
peacock stru ng, you are going to end
up in the abyss. If the people of Sodom
had had your chances, the city would
s ll be around.
24 At Judgment Day they'll get oﬀ easy
compared to you."
25 Abruptly Jesus broke into prayer:
"Thank you, Father, Lord of heaven
and earth. You've concealed your ways
from sophis cates and know-it-alls, but
spelled them out clearly to ordinary
people.
26 Yes, Father, that's the way you like to
work."
27 Jesus resumed talking to the people,
but now tenderly. "The Father has given
me all these things to do and say. This isMATTHEW 11 – 12
62
a unique Father-Son opera on, coming
out of Father and Son in macies and
knowledge. No one knows the Son the
way the Father does, nor the Father the
way the Son does. But I'm not keeping it
to myself; I'm ready to go over it line by
line with anyone willing to listen.
28 "Are you red? Worn out? Burned
out on religion? Come to me. Get away
with me and you'll recover your life. I'll
show you how to take a real rest.
29 Walk with me and work with me--
watch how I do it. Learn the unforced
rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything
heavy or ill-ﬁ ng on you.
30 Keep company with me and you'll
learn to live freely and lightly."
1 One Sabbath, Jesus was strolling
with his disciples through a
ﬁeld of ripe grain. Hungry, the disciples
were pulling oﬀ the heads of grain and
munching on them.
12MATTHEW 12
63
2 Some Pharisees reported them to
Jesus: "Your disciples are breaking the
Sabbath rules!"
3 Jesus said, "Really? Didn't you ever
read what David and his companions did
when they were hungry,
4 how they entered the sanctuary and
ate fresh bread oﬀ the altar, bread that
no one but priests were allowed to eat?
5 And didn't you ever read in God's Law
that priests carrying out their Temple
du es break Sabbath rules all the me
and it's not held against them?
6 "There is far more at stake here than
religion.
7 If you had any idea what this Scripture
meant--'I prefer a ﬂexible heart to
an inﬂexible ritual'--you wouldn't be
nitpicking like this.
8 The Son of Man is no lackey to the
Sabbath; he's in charge."MATTHEW 12
9 When Jesus le
64
the ﬁeld, he entered
their mee ng place.
10 There was a man there with a
crippled hand. They said to Jesus, "Is it
legal to heal on the Sabbath?" They were
bai ng him.
11 He replied, "Is there a person here
who, ﬁnding one of your lambs fallen
into a ravine, wouldn't, even though it
was a Sabbath, pull it out?
12 Surely kindness to people is as legal
as kindness to animals!"
13 Then he said to the man, "Hold out
your hand." He held it out and it was
healed.
14 The Pharisees walked out furious,
spu ering about how they were going to
ruin Jesus.
15 Jesus, knowing they were out to get
him, moved on. A lot of people followed
him, and he healed them all.MATTHEW 12
16 He also cau
65
oned them to keep it
quiet,
17 following guidelines set down by
Isaiah:
18 Look well at my handpicked servant;
I love him so much, take such delight in
him. I've placed my Spirit on him; he'll
decree jus ce to the na ons.
19 But he won't yell, won't raise his
voice; there'll be no commo on in the
streets.
20 He won't walk over anyone's feelings,
won't push you into a corner. Before you
know it, his jus ce will triumph;
21 the mere sound of his name
will signal hope, even among far-oﬀ
unbelievers.
22 Next a poor demon-aﬄicted wretch,
both blind and deaf, was set down
before him. Jesus healed him, gave him
his sight and hearing.MATTHEW 12
66
23 The people who saw it were
impressed--"This has to be the Son of
David!"
24 But the Pharisees, when they heard
the report, were cynical. "Black magic,"
they said. "Some devil trick he's pulled
from his sleeve."
25 Jesus confronted their slander. "A
judge who gives opposite verdicts on
the same person cancels himself out;
a family that's in a constant squabble
disintegrates;
26 if Satan banishes Satan, is there any
Satan le ?
27 If you're slinging devil mud at me,
calling me a devil kicking out devils,
doesn't the same mud s ck to your own
exorcists?
28 "But if it's by God's power that I am
sending the evil spirits packing, then
God's kingdom is here for sure.MATTHEW 12
67
29 How in the world do you think it's
possible in broad daylight to enter the
house of an awake, able-bodied man
and walk oﬀ with his possessions unless
you e him up ﬁrst? Tie him up, though,
and you can clean him out.
30 "This is war, and there is no neutral
ground. If you're not on my side, you're
the enemy; if you're not helping, you're
making things worse.
31 "There's nothing done or said that
can't be forgiven. But if you deliberately
persist in your slanders against God's
Spirit, you are repudia ng the very One
who forgives.
32 If you reject the Son of Man out of
some misunderstanding, the Holy Spirit
can forgive you, but when you reject the
Holy Spirit, you're sawing oﬀ the branch
on which you're si ng, severing by your
own perversity all connec on with the
One who forgives.MATTHEW 12

33 "If you grow a healthy tree, you'll
pick healthy fruit. If you grow a diseased
tree, you'll pick worm-eaten fruit. The
fruit tells you about the tree.
34 "You have minds like a snake pit! How
do you suppose what you say is worth
anything when you are so foul-minded?
It's your heart, not the dic onary, that
gives meaning to your words.
35 A good person produces good deeds
and words season a er season. An evil
person is a blight on the orchard.
36 Let me tell you something: Every one
of these careless words is going to come
back to haunt you. There will be a me
of Reckoning. Words are powerful; take
them seriously.
37 Words can be your salva on. Words
can also be your damna on."
38 Later a few religion scholars and
Pharisees got on him. "Teacher, we want
to see your creden als. Give us someMATTHEW 12
69
hard evidence that God is in this. How
about a miracle?"
39 Jesus said, "You're looking for proof,
but you're looking for the wrong kind. All
you want is something to llate your
curiosity, sa sfy your lust for miracles.
The only proof you're going to get is
what looks like the absence of proof:
Jonah-evidence.
40 Like Jonah, three days and nights in
the ﬁsh's belly, the Son of Man will be
gone three days and nights in a deep
grave.
41 "On Judgment Day, the Ninevites
will stand up and give evidence that will
condemn this genera on, because when
Jonah preached to them they changed
their lives. A far greater preacher than
Jonah is here, and you squabble about
'proofs.'
42 On Judgment Day, the Queen of
Sheba will come forward and bringMATTHEW 12
70
evidence that will condemn this
genera on, because she traveled from
a far corner of the earth to listen to
wise Solomon. Wisdom far greater than
Solomon's is right in front of you, and
you quibble over 'evidence.'
43 "When a deﬁling evil spirit is expelled
from someone, it dri s along through
the desert looking for an oasis, some
unsuspec ng soul it can bedevil. When
it doesn't ﬁnd anyone,
44 it says, 'I'll go back to my old haunt.'
On return it ﬁnds the person spotlessly
clean, but vacant.
45 It then runs out and rounds up seven
other spirits more evil than itself and
they all move in, whooping it up. That
person ends up far worse oﬀ than if
he'd never go en cleaned up in the ﬁrst
place. "That's what this genera on is
like: You may think you have cleaned out
the junk from your lives and go en readyMATTHEW 12
71
for God, but you weren't hospitable to
my kingdom message, and now all the
devils are moving back in."
46 While he was s ll talking to the
crowd, his mother and brothers showed
up. They were outside trying to get a
message to him.
47 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother
and brothers are out here, wan ng to
speak with you."
48 Jesus didn't respond directly, but
said, "Who do you think my mother and
brothers are?"
49 He then stretched out his hand
toward his disciples. "Look closely. These
are my mother and brothers.
50 Obedience is thicker than blood.
The person who obeys my heavenly
Father's will is my brother and sister and
mother."MATTHEW 13
13
72
1 At about that same
me Jesus
le the house and sat on the
beach.
2 In no me at all a crowd gathered
along the shoreline, forcing him to get
into a boat.
3 Using the boat as a pulpit, he
addressed his congrega on, telling
stories. "What do you make of this? A
farmer planted seed.
4 As he sca ered the seed, some of it
fell on the road, and birds ate it.
5 Some fell in the gravel; it sprouted
quickly but didn't put down roots,
6 so when the sun came up it withered
just as quickly.
7 Some fell in the weeds; as it came up,
it was strangled by the weeds.
8 Some fell on good earth, and produced
a harvest beyond his wildest dreams.
9 "Are you listening to this? Really
listening?"MATTHEW 13
73
10 The disciples came up and asked,
"Why do you tell stories?"
11 He replied, "You've been given insight
into God's kingdom. You know how it
works. Not everybody has this gi , this
insight; it hasn't been given to them.
12 Whenever someone has a ready
heart for this, the insights and
understandings ﬂow freely. But if there
is no readiness, any trace of recep vity
soon disappears.
13 That's why I tell stories: to create
readiness, to nudge the people toward
recep ve insight. In their present state
they can stare ll doomsday and not see
it, listen ll they're blue in the face and
not get it.
14 I don't want Isaiah's forecast
repeated all over again: Your ears are
open but you don't hear a thing. Your
eyes are awake but you don't see a thing.MATTHEW 13
74
15 The people are blockheads! They
s ck their ﬁngers in their ears so they
won't have to listen; They screw their
eyes shut so they won't have to look,
so they won't have to deal with me
face-to-face and let me heal them.
16 "But you have God-blessed eyes-
-eyes that see! And God-blessed
ears--ears that hear!
17 A lot of people, prophets and humble
believers among them, would have given
anything to see what you are seeing, to
hear what you are hearing, but never
had the chance.
18 "Study this story of the farmer
plan ng seed.
19 When anyone hears news of the
kingdom and doesn't take it in, it just
remains on the surface, and so the Evil
One comes along and plucks it right out
of that person's heart. This is the seed
the farmer sca ers on the road.MATTHEW 13
75
20 "The seed cast in the gravel--this
is the person who hears and instantly
responds with enthusiasm.
21 But there is no soil of character, and
so when the emo ons wear oﬀ and
some diﬃculty arrives, there is nothing
to show for it.
22 "The seed cast in the weeds is the
person who hears the kingdom news,
but weeds of worry and illusions about
ge ng more and wan ng everything
under the sun strangle what was heard,
and nothing comes of it.
23 "The seed cast on good earth is the
person who hears and takes in the News,
and then produces a harvest beyond his
wildest dreams."
24 He told another story. "God's
kingdom is like a farmer who planted
good seed in his ﬁeld.
25 That night, while his hired men were
asleep, his enemy sowed thistles allMATTHEW 13
76
through the wheat and slipped away
before dawn.
26 When the ﬁrst green shoots appeared
and the grain began to form, the thistles
showed up, too.
27 "The farmhands came to the farmer
and said, 'Master, that was clean seed
you planted, wasn't it? Where did these
thistles come from?'
28 "He answered, 'Some enemy did
this.' "The farmhands asked, 'Should we
weed out the thistles?'
29 "He said, 'No, if you weed the thistles,
you'll pull up the wheat, too.
30 Let them grow together un l harvest
me. Then I'll instruct the harvesters
to pull up the thistles and e them in
bundles for the ﬁre, then gather the
wheat and put it in the barn.'"
31 Another story. "God's kingdom is like
a pine nut that a farmer plants.MATTHEW 13
77
32 It is quite small as seeds go, but in
the course of years it grows into a huge
pine tree, and eagles build nests in it."
33 Another story. "God's kingdom is
like yeast that a woman works into the
dough for dozens of loaves of barley
bread--and waits while the dough rises."
34 All Jesus did that day was tell
stories--a long storytelling a ernoon.
35 His storytelling fulﬁlled the prophecy:
I will open my mouth and tell stories;
I will bring out into the open things
hidden since the world's ﬁrst day.
36 Jesus dismissed the congrega on and
went into the house. His disciples came
in and said, "Explain to us that story of
the thistles in the ﬁeld."
37 So he explained. "The farmer who
sows the pure seed is the Son of Man.
38 The ﬁeld is the world, the pure seeds
are subjects of the kingdom, the thistles
are subjects of the Devil,MATTHEW 13
78
39 and the enemy who sows them is the
Devil. The harvest is the end of the age,
the curtain of history. The harvest hands
are angels.
40 "The picture of thistles pulled up and
burned is a scene from the ﬁnal act.
41 The Son of Man will send his angels,
weed out the thistles from his kingdom,
42 pitch them in the trash, and be done
with them. They are going to complain
to high heaven, but nobody is going to
listen.
43 At the same me, ripe, holy lives will
mature and adorn the kingdom of their
Father. "Are you listening to this? Really
listening?
44 "God's kingdom is like a treasure
hidden in a ﬁeld for years and then
accidentally found by a trespasser. The
ﬁnder is ecsta c--what a ﬁnd!--and
proceeds to sell everything he owns to
raise money and buy that ﬁeld.MATTHEW 13
79
45 "Or, God's kingdom is like a jewel
merchant on the hunt for excellent
pearls.
46 Finding one that is ﬂawless, he
immediately sells everything and buys it.
47 "Or, God's kingdom is like a ﬁshnet
cast into the sea, catching all kinds of
ﬁsh.
48 When it is full, it is hauled onto the
beach. The good ﬁsh are picked out
and put in a tub; those unﬁt to eat are
thrown away.
49 That's how it will be when the curtain
comes down on history. The angels will
come and cull the bad ﬁsh
50 and throw them in the garbage. There
will be a lot of desperate complaining,
but it won't do any good."
51 Jesus asked, "Are you star ng to get
a handle on all this?" They answered,
"Yes."MATTHEW 13
80
52 He said, "Then you see how every
student well-trained in God's kingdom
is like the owner of a general store who
can put his hands on anything you need,
old or new, exactly when you need it."
53 When Jesus ﬁnished telling these
stories, he le there,
54 returned to his hometown, and gave
a lecture in the mee nghouse. He made
a real hit, impressing everyone. "We
had no idea he was this good!" they
said. "How did he get so wise, get such
ability?"
55 But in the next breath they were
cu ng him down: "We've known him
since he was a kid; he's the carpenter's
son. We know his mother, Mary. We
know his brothers James and Joseph,
Simon and Judas.
56 All his sisters live here. Who does he
think he is?"
57 They got their noses all out of joint.MATTHEW 13 – 14
81
58 But Jesus said, "A prophet is taken for
granted in his hometown and his family."
He didn't do many miracles there
because of their hos le indiﬀerence.
1 At about this me, Herod, the
regional ruler, heard what was
being said about Jesus.
2 He said to his servants, "This has to
be John the Bap zer come back from
the dead. That's why he's able to work
miracles!"
3 Herod had arrested John, put him in
chains, and sent him to prison to placate
Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
4 John had provoked Herod by naming
his rela onship with Herodias "adultery."
5 Herod wanted to kill him, but he was
afraid because so many people revered
John as a prophet of God.
6 But at his birthday celebra on, he
got his chance. Herodias's daughter
14MATTHEW 14
82
provided the entertainment, dancing for
the guests. She swept Herod away.
7 In his drunken enthusiasm, he
promised her on oath anything she
wanted.
8 Already coached by her mother, she
was ready: "Give me, served up on a
pla er, the head of John the Bap zer."
9 That sobered the king up fast.
Unwilling to lose face with his guests, he
did it
10 --ordered John's head cut oﬀ
11 and presented to the girl on a pla er.
She in turn gave it to her mother.
12 Later, John's disciples got the body,
gave it a reverent burial, and reported to
Jesus.
13 When Jesus got the news, he slipped
away by boat to an out-of-the-way place
by himself. But unsuccessfully--someone
saw him and the word got around. SoonMATTHEW 14
83
a lot of people from the nearby villages
walked around the lake to where he was.
14 When he saw them coming, he was
overcome with pity and healed their
sick.
15 Toward evening the disciples
approached him. "We're out in the
country and it's ge ng late. Dismiss the
people so they can go to the villages and
get some supper."
16 But Jesus said, "There is no need to
dismiss them. You give them supper."
17 "All we have are ﬁve loaves of bread
and two ﬁsh," they said.
18 Jesus said, "Bring them here."
19 Then he had the people sit on the
grass. He took the ﬁve loaves and two
ﬁsh, li ed his face to heaven in prayer,
blessed, broke, and gave the bread to
the disciples. The disciples then gave the
food to the congrega on.MATTHEW 14
84
20 They all ate their ﬁll. They gathered
twelve baskets of le overs.
21 About ﬁve thousand were fed.
22 As soon as the meal was ﬁnished, he
insisted that the disciples get in the boat
and go on ahead to the other side while
he dismissed the people.
23 With the crowd dispersed, he
climbed the mountain so he could be by
himself and pray. He stayed there alone,
late into the night.
24 Meanwhile, the boat was far out
to sea when the wind came up against
them and they were ba ered by the
waves.
25 At about four o'clock in the morning,
Jesus came toward them walking on the
water.
26 They were scared out of their wits.
"A ghost!" they said, crying out in terror.
27 But Jesus was quick to comfort them.
"Courage, it's me. Don't be afraid."MATTHEW 14
85
28 Peter, suddenly bold, said, "Master, if
it's really you, call me to come to you on
the water."
29 He said, "Come ahead." Jumping out
of the boat, Peter walked on the water
to Jesus.
30 But when he looked down at the
waves churning beneath his feet, he lost
his nerve and started to sink. He cried,
"Master, save me!"
31 Jesus didn't hesitate. He reached
down and grabbed his hand. Then he
said, "Faint-heart, what got into you?"
32 The two of them climbed into the
boat, and the wind died down.
33 The disciples in the boat, having
watched the whole thing, worshiped
Jesus, saying, "This is it! You are God's
Son for sure!"
34 On return, they beached the boat at
Gennesaret.MATTHEW 14 – 15
86
35 When the people got wind that he
was back, they sent out word through
the neighborhood and rounded up all
the sick,
36 who asked for permission to touch
the edge of his coat. And whoever
touched him was healed.
1 A er that, Pharisees and
religion scholars came to Jesus all
the way from Jerusalem, cri cizing,
2 "Why do your disciples play fast and
loose with the rules?"
3 But Jesus put it right back on them.
"Why do you use your rules to play fast
and loose with God's commands?
4 God clearly says, 'Respect your father
and mother,' and, 'Anyone denouncing
father or mother should be killed.'
5 But you weasel around that by saying,
'Whoever wants to, can say to father and
mother, What I owed to you I've given to
God.'
15MATTHEW 15
6 That can hardly be called respec
87
ng a
parent. You cancel God's command by
your rules.
7 Frauds! Isaiah's prophecy of you hit
the bull's-eye:
8 These people make a big show of
saying the right thing, but their heart
isn't in it.
9 They act like they're worshiping me,
but they don't mean it. They just use me
as a cover for teaching whatever suits
their fancy."
10 He then called the crowd together
and said, "Listen, and take this to heart.
11 It's not what you swallow that
pollutes your life, but what you vomit
up."
12 Later his disciples came and told him,
"Did you know how upset the Pharisees
were when they heard what you said?"MATTHEW 15
88
13 Jesus shrugged it oﬀ. "Every tree that
wasn't planted by my Father in heaven
will be pulled up by its roots.
14 Forget them. They are blind men
leading blind men. When a blind man
leads a blind man, they both end up in
the ditch."
15 Peter said, "I don't get it. Put it in
plain language."
16 Jesus replied, "You too? Are you
being willfully stupid?
17 Don't you know that anything that
is swallowed works its way through the
intes nes and is ﬁnally defecated?
18 But what comes out of the mouth
gets its start in the heart.
19 It's from the heart that we vomit
up evil arguments, murders, adulteries,
fornica ons, the s, lies, and cussing.
20 That's what pollutes. Ea ng or not
ea ng certain foods, washing or notMATTHEW 15
89
washing your hands--that's neither here
nor there."
21 From there Jesus took a trip to Tyre
and Sidon.
22 They had hardly arrived when a
Canaanite woman came down from the
hills and pleaded, "Mercy, Master, Son
of David! My daughter is cruelly aﬄicted
by an evil spirit."
23 Jesus ignored her. The disciples came
and complained, "Now she's bothering
us. Would you please take care of her?
She's driving us crazy."
24 Jesus refused, telling them, "I've got
my hands full dealing with the lost sheep
of Israel."
25 Then the woman came back to Jesus,
went to her knees, and begged. "Master,
help me."
26 He said, "It's not right to take bread
out of children's mouths and throw it to
dogs."MATTHEW 15
90
27 She was quick: "You're right, Master,
but beggar dogs do get scraps from the
master's table."
28 Jesus gave in. "Oh, woman, your faith
is something else. What you want is
what you get!" Right then her daughter
became well.
29 A er Jesus returned, he walked
along Lake Galilee and then climbed a
mountain and took his place, ready to
receive visitors.
30 They came, tons of them, bringing
along the paraplegic, the blind, the
maimed, the mute--all sorts of people
in need--and more or less threw them
down at Jesus' feet to see what he would
do with them. He healed them.
31 When the people saw the mutes
speaking, the maimed healthy, the
paraplegics walking around, the blind
looking around, they were astonishedMATTHEW 15
91
and let everyone know that God was
blazingly alive among them.
32 But Jesus wasn't ﬁnished with them.
He called his disciples and said, "I hurt
for these people. For three days now
they've been with me, and now they
have nothing to eat. I can't send them
away without a meal--they'd probably
collapse on the road."
33 His disciples said, "But where in this
deserted place are you going to dig up
enough food for a meal?"
34 Jesus asked, "How much bread do
you have?" "Seven loaves," they said,
"plus a few ﬁsh."
35 At that, Jesus directed the people to
sit down.
36 He took the seven loaves and the
ﬁsh. A er giving thanks, he divided it up
and gave it to the people.MATTHEW 15 – 16
92
37 Everyone ate. They had all they
wanted. It took seven large baskets to
collect the le overs.
38 Over four thousand people ate their
ﬁll at that meal.
39 A er Jesus sent them away, he
climbed in the boat and crossed over to
the Magadan hills.
1 Some Pharisees and Sadducees
were on him again, pressing him
to prove himself to them.
2 He told them, "You have a saying that
goes, 'Red sky at night, sailor's delight;
3 red sky at morning, sailors take
warning.' You ﬁnd it easy enough to
forecast the weather--why can't you
read the signs of the mes?
4 An evil and wanton genera on is
always wan ng signs and wonders. The
only sign you'll get is the Jonah sign."
Then he turned on his heel and walked
away.
16MATTHEW 16
93
5 On their way to the other side of the
lake, the disciples discovered they had
forgo en to bring along bread.
6 In the mean me, Jesus said to
them, "Keep a sharp eye out for
Pharisee-Sadducee yeast."
7 Thinking he was scolding them for
forge ng bread, they discussed in
whispers what to do.
8 Jesus knew what they were doing and
said, "Why all these worried whispers
about forge ng the bread? Runt
believers!
9 Haven't you caught on yet? Don't you
remember the ﬁve loaves of bread and
the ﬁve thousand people, and how many
baskets of fragments you picked up?
10 Or the seven loaves that fed four
thousand, and how many baskets of
le overs you collected?MATTHEW 16
94
11 Haven't you realized yet that bread
isn't the problem? The problem is yeast,
Pharisee-Sadducee yeast."
12 Then they got it: that he wasn't
concerned about ea ng, but teaching--
the Pharisee-Sadducee kind of teaching.
13 When Jesus arrived in the villages of
Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
"What are people saying about who the
Son of Man is?"
14 They replied, "Some think he is John
the Bap zer, some say Elijah, some
Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."
15 He pressed them, "And how about
you? Who do you say I am?"
16 Simon Peter said, "You're the Christ,
the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
17 Jesus came back, "God bless you,
Simon, son of Jonah! You didn't get that
answer out of books or from teachers.
My Father in heaven, God himself, let
you in on this secret of who I really am.MATTHEW 16
95
18 And now I'm going to tell you who
you are, really are. You are Peter, a
rock. This is the rock on which I will
put together my church, a church so
expansive with energy that not even the
gates of hell will be able to keep it out.
19 "And that's not all. You will have
complete and free access to God's
kingdom, keys to open any and every
door: no more barriers between heaven
and earth, earth and heaven. A yes on
earth is yes in heaven. A no on earth is
no in heaven."
20 He swore the disciples to secrecy. He
made them promise they would tell no
one that he was the Messiah.
21 Then Jesus made it clear to his
disciples that it was now necessary for
him to go to Jerusalem, submit to an
ordeal of suﬀering at the hands of the
religious leaders, be killed, and then on
the third day be raised up alive.MATTHEW 16
22 Peter took him in hand, protes
96
ng,
"Impossible, Master! That can never
be!"
23 But Jesus didn't swerve. "Peter, get
out of my way. Satan, get lost. You have
no idea how God works."
24 Then Jesus went to work on his
disciples. "Anyone who intends to come
with me has to let me lead. You're not in
the driver's seat; I am. Don't run from
suﬀering; embrace it. Follow me and I'll
show you how.
25 Self-help is no help at all. Self-
sacriﬁce is the way, my way, to ﬁnding
yourself, your true self.
26 What kind of deal is it to get
everything you want but lose yourself?
What could you ever trade your soul for?
27 "Don't be in such a hurry to go into
business for yourself. Before you know it
the Son of Man will arrive with all the
splendor of his Father, accompanied byMATTHEW 16 – 17
97
an army of angels. You'll get everything
you have coming to you, a personal gi .
28 This isn't pie in the sky by and by.
Some of you standing here are going to
see it take place, see the Son of Man in
kingdom glory."
1 Six days later, three of them saw
that glory. Jesus took Peter and
the brothers, James and John, and led
them up a high mountain.
2 His appearance changed from the
inside out, right before their eyes.
Sunlight poured from his face. His
clothes were ﬁlled with light.
3 Then they realized that Moses
and Elijah were also there in deep
conversa on with him.
4 Peter broke in, "Master, this is a
great moment! What would you think
if I built three memorials here on the
mountain--one for you, one for Moses,
one for Elijah?"
17MATTHEW 17
98
5 While he was going on like this,
babbling, a light-radiant cloud enveloped
them, and sounding from deep in the
cloud a voice: "This is my Son, marked
by my love, focus of my delight. Listen to
him."
6 When the disciples heard it, they fell
ﬂat on their faces, scared to death.
7 But Jesus came over and touched
them. "Don't be afraid."
8 When they opened their eyes and
looked around all they saw was Jesus,
only Jesus.
9 Coming down the mountain, Jesus
swore them to secrecy. "Don't breathe a
word of what you've seen. A er the Son
of Man is raised from the dead, you are
free to talk."
10 The disciples, meanwhile, were
asking ques ons. "Why do the religion
scholars say that Elijah has to come
ﬁrst?"MATTHEW 17
99
11 Jesus answered, "Elijah does come
and get everything ready.
12 I'm telling you, Elijah has already
come but they didn't know him when
they saw him. They treated him like dirt,
the same way they are about to treat
the Son of Man."
13 That's when the disciples realized
that all along he had been talking about
John the Bap zer.
14 At the bo om of the mountain, they
were met by a crowd of wai ng people.
As they approached, a man came out of
the crowd and fell to his knees begging,
15 "Master, have mercy on my son. He
goes out of his mind and suﬀers terribly,
falling into seizures. Frequently he is
pitched into the ﬁre, other mes into the
river.
16 I brought him to your disciples, but
they could do nothing for him."MATTHEW 17
17 Jesus said, "What a genera
100
on! No
sense of God! No focus to your lives!
How many mes do I have to go over
these things? How much longer do I
have to put up with this? Bring the boy
here."
18 He ordered the aﬄic ng demon
out--and it was out, gone. From that
moment on the boy was well.
19 When the disciples had Jesus oﬀ to
themselves, they asked, "Why couldn't
we throw it out?"
20 "Because you're not yet taking God
seriously," said Jesus. "The simple truth
is that if you had a mere kernel of faith,
a poppy seed, say, you would tell this
mountain, 'Move!' and it would move.
There is nothing you wouldn't be able to
tackle."
22 As they were regrouping in Galilee,
Jesus told them, "The Son of Man isMATTHEW 17
101
about to be betrayed to some people
who want nothing to do with God.
23 They will murder him--and three
days later he will be raised alive." The
disciples felt terrible.
24 When they arrived at Capernaum,
the tax men came to Peter and asked,
"Does your teacher pay taxes?"
25 Peter said, "Of course." But as
soon as they were in the house, Jesus
confronted him. "Simon, what do you
think? When a king levies taxes, who
pays--his children or his subjects?"
26 He answered, "His subjects." Jesus
said, "Then the children get oﬀ free,
right?
27 But so we don't upset them
needlessly, go down to the lake, cast a
hook, and pull in the ﬁrst ﬁsh that bites.
Open its mouth and you'll ﬁnd a coin.
Take it and give it to the tax men. It will
be enough for both of us."MATTHEW 18
1 At about the same
102
me, the
disciples came to Jesus asking,
"Who gets the highest rank in God's
kingdom?"
2 For an answer Jesus called over a
child, whom he stood in the middle of
the room,
3 and said, "I'm telling you, once and for
all, that unless you return to square one
and start over like children, you're not
even going to get a look at the kingdom,
let alone get in.
4 Whoever becomes simple and
elemental again, like this child, will rank
high in God's kingdom.
5 What's more, when you receive the
childlike on my account, it's the same as
receiving me.
6 "But if you give them a hard me,
bullying or taking advantage of their
simple trust, you'll soon wish you hadn't.
You'd be be er oﬀ dropped in the
18MATTHEW 18
103
middle of the lake with a millstone
around your neck.
7 Doom to the world for giving these
God-believing children a hard me! Hard
mes are inevitable, but you don't have
to make it worse--and it's doomsday to
you if you do.
8 "If your hand or your foot gets in the
way of God, chop it oﬀ and throw it
away. You're be er oﬀ maimed or lame
and alive than the proud owners of two
hands and two feet, godless in a furnace
of eternal ﬁre.
9 And if your eye distracts you from
God, pull it out and throw it away.
You're be er oﬀ one-eyed and alive than
exercising your twenty-twenty vision
from inside the ﬁre of hell.
10 "Watch that you don't treat a
single one of these childlike believers
arrogantly. You realize, don't you, thatMATTHEW 18
104
their personal angels are constantly in
touch with my Father in heaven?
12 "Look at it this way. If someone
has a hundred sheep and one of them
wanders oﬀ, doesn't he leave the
ninety-nine and go a er the one?
13 And if he ﬁnds it, doesn't he make far
more over it than over the ninety-nine
who stay put?
14 Your Father in heaven feels the same
way. He doesn't want to lose even one
of these simple believers.
15 "If a fellow believer hurts you, go and
tell him--work it out between the two of
you. If he listens, you've made a friend.
16 If he won't listen, take one or two
others along so that the presence of
witnesses will keep things honest, and
try again.
17 If he s ll won't listen, tell the church.
If he won't listen to the church, you'll
have to start over from scratch, confrontMATTHEW 18
105
him with the need for repentance, and
oﬀer again God's forgiving love.
18 "Take this most seriously: A yes on
earth is yes in heaven; a no on earth
is no in heaven. What you say to one
another is eternal. I mean this.
19 When two of you get together on
anything at all on earth and make a
prayer of it, my Father in heaven goes
into ac on.
20 And when two or three of you are
together because of me, you can be sure
that I'll be there."
21 At that point Peter got up the nerve
to ask, "Master, how many mes do I
forgive a brother or sister who hurts me?
Seven?"
22 Jesus replied, "Seven! Hardly. Try
seventy mes seven.
23 "The kingdom of God is like a king
who decided to square accounts with his
servants.MATTHEW 18
106
24 As he got under way, one servant
was brought before him who had run up
a debt of a hundred thousand dollars.
25 He couldn't pay up, so the king
ordered the man, along with his wife,
children, and goods, to be auc oned oﬀ
at the slave market.
26 "The poor wretch threw himself at
the king's feet and begged, 'Give me a
chance and I'll pay it all back.'
27 Touched by his plea, the king let him
oﬀ, erasing the debt.
28 "The servant was no sooner out of
the room when he came upon one of
his fellow servants who owed him ten
dollars. He seized him by the throat and
demanded, 'Pay up. Now!'
29 "The poor wretch threw himself
down and begged, 'Give me a chance
and I'll pay it all back.'MATTHEW 18 – 19
107
30 But he wouldn't do it. He had him
arrested and put in jail un l the debt
was paid.
31 When the other servants saw this
going on, they were outraged and
brought a detailed report to the king.
32 "The king summoned the man and
said, 'You evil servant! I forgave your
en re debt when you begged me for
mercy.
33 Shouldn't you be compelled to be
merciful to your fellow servant who
asked for mercy?'
34 The king was furious and put the
screws to the man un l he paid back his
en re debt.
35 And that's exactly what my Father
in heaven is going to do to each one of
you who doesn't forgive uncondi onally
anyone who asks for mercy."
1 When Jesus had completed
these teachings, he le Galilee
19MATTHEW 19
108
and crossed the region of Judea on the
other side of the Jordan.
2 Great crowds followed him there, and
he healed them.
3 One day the Pharisees were badgering
him: "Is it legal for a man to divorce his
wife for any reason?"
4 He answered, "Haven't you read in
your Bible that the Creator originally
made man and woman for each other,
male and female?
5 And because of this, a man leaves
father and mother and is ﬁrmly bonded
to his wife, becoming one ﬂesh--no
longer two bodies but one.
6 Because God created this organic
union of the two sexes, no one should
desecrate his art by cu ng them apart."
7 They shot back in rebu al, "If that's
so, why did Moses give instruc ons for
divorce papers and divorce procedures?"MATTHEW 19
109
8 Jesus said, "Moses provided for
divorce as a concession to your
hardheartedness, but it is not part of
God's original plan.
9 I'm holding you to the original plan,
and holding you liable for adultery if you
divorce your faithful wife and then marry
someone else. I make an excep on in
cases where the spouse has commi ed
adultery."
10 Jesus' disciples objected, "If those
are the terms of marriage, we're stuck.
Why get married?"
11 But Jesus said, "Not everyone is
mature enough to live a married life. It
requires a certain ap tude and grace.
Marriage isn't for everyone.
12 Some, from birth seemingly, never
give marriage a thought. Others never
get asked--or accepted. And some
decide not to get married for kingdomMATTHEW 19
110
reasons. But if you're capable of growing
into the largeness of marriage, do it."
13 One day children were brought to
Jesus in the hope that he would lay
hands on them and pray over them. The
disciples shooed them oﬀ.
14 But Jesus intervened: "Let the
children alone, don't prevent them from
coming to me. God's kingdom is made
up of people like these."
15 A er laying hands on them, he le .
16 Another day, a man stopped Jesus
and asked, "Teacher, what good thing
must I do to get eternal life?"
17 Jesus said, "Why do you ques on me
about what's good? God is the One who
is good. If you want to enter the life of
God, just do what he tells you."
18 The man asked, "What in par cular?"
Jesus said, "Don't murder, don't commit
adultery, don't steal, don't lie,MATTHEW 19
111
19 honor your father and mother, and
love your neighbor as you do yourself."
20 The young man said, "I've done all
that. What's le ?"
21 "If you want to give it all you've got,"
Jesus replied, "go sell your possessions;
give everything to the poor. All your
wealth will then be in heaven. Then
come follow me."
22 That was the last thing the young man
expected to hear. And so, cres allen, he
walked away. He was holding on ght to
a lot of things, and he couldn't bear to
let go.
23 As he watched him go, Jesus told his
disciples, "Do you have any idea how
diﬃcult it is for the rich to enter God's
kingdom?
24 Let me tell you, it's easier to gallop a
camel through a needle's eye than for
the rich to enter God's kingdom."MATTHEW 19
112
25 The disciples were staggered. "Then
who has any chance at all?"
26 Jesus looked hard at them and said,
"No chance at all if you think you can
pull it oﬀ yourself. Every chance in the
world if you trust God to do it."
27 Then Peter chimed in, "We le
everything and followed you. What do
we get out of it?"
28 Jesus replied, "Yes, you have followed
me. In the re-crea on of the world,
when the Son of Man will rule gloriously,
you who have followed me will also rule,
star ng with the twelve tribes of Israel.
29 And not only you, but anyone who
sacriﬁces home, family, ﬁelds--whatever-
-because of me will get it all back a
hundred mes over, not to men on the
considerable bonus of eternal life.
30 This is the Great Reversal: many of
the ﬁrst ending up last, and the last ﬁrst.MATTHEW 20
20
113
1 "God's kingdom is like an estate
manager who went out early
in the morning to hire workers for his
vineyard.
2 They agreed on a wage of a dollar a
day, and went to work.
3 "Later, about nine o'clock, the
manager saw some other men hanging
around the town square unemployed.
4 He told them to go to work in his
vineyard and he would pay them a fair
wage.
5 They went. "He did the same thing at
noon, and again at three o'clock.
6 At ﬁve o'clock he went back and found
s ll others standing around. He said,
'Why are you standing around all day
doing nothing?
7 '"They said, 'Because no one hired
us.' "He told them to go to work in his
vineyard.MATTHEW 20
114
8 "When the day's work was over, the
owner of the vineyard instructed his
foreman, 'Call the workers in and pay
them their wages. Start with the last
hired and go on to the ﬁrst.'
9 "Those hired at ﬁve o'clock came up
and were each given a dollar.
10 When those who were hired ﬁrst saw
that, they assumed they would get far
more. But they got the same, each of
them one dollar.
11 Taking the dollar, they groused
angrily to the manager,
12 'These last workers put in only one
easy hour, and you just made them
equal to us, who slaved all day under a
scorching sun.'
13 "He replied to the one speaking for
the rest, 'Friend, I haven't been unfair.
We agreed on the wage of a dollar, didn't
we?MATTHEW 20
115
14 So take it and go. I decided to give to
the one who came last the same as you.
15 Can't I do what I want with my own
money? Are you going to get s ngy
because I am generous?'
16 "Here it is again, the Great Reversal:
many of the ﬁrst ending up last, and the
last ﬁrst."
17 Jesus, now well on the way up to
Jerusalem, took the Twelve oﬀ to the
side of the road and said,
18 "Listen to me carefully. We are on
our way up to Jerusalem. When we get
there, the Son of Man will be betrayed
to the religious leaders and scholars.
They will sentence him to death.
19 They will then hand him over to the
Romans for mockery and torture and
cruciﬁxion. On the third day he will be
raised up alive."
20 It was about that me that the
mother of the Zebedee brothers cameMATTHEW 20
116
with her two sons and knelt before Jesus
with a request.
21 "What do you want?" Jesus asked.
She said, "Give your word that these two
sons of mine will be awarded the highest
places of honor in your kingdom, one at
your right hand, one at your le hand."
22 Jesus responded, "You have no
idea what you're asking." And he said
to James and John, "Are you capable
of drinking the cup that I'm about to
drink?" They said, "Sure, why not?"
23 Jesus said, "Come to think of it, you
are going to drink my cup. But as to
awarding places of honor, that's not my
business. My Father is taking care of
that."
24 When the ten others heard about
this, they lost their tempers, thoroughly
disgusted with the two brothers.
25 So Jesus got them together to se le
things down. He said, "You've observedMATTHEW 20
117
how godless rulers throw their weight
around, how quickly a li le power goes
to their heads.
26 It's not going to be that way with
you. Whoever wants to be great must
become a servant.
27 Whoever wants to be ﬁrst among
you must be your slave.
28 That is what the Son of Man has
done: He came to serve, not be served--
and then to give away his life in exchange
for the many who are held hostage."
29 As they were leaving Jericho, a huge
crowd followed.
30 Suddenly they came upon two blind
men si ng alongside the road. When
they heard it was Jesus passing, they
cried out, "Master, have mercy on us!
Mercy, Son of David!"
31 The crowd tried to hush them up, but
they got all the louder, crying, "Master,
have mercy on us! Mercy, Son of David!"MATTHEW 20 – 21
118
32 Jesus stopped and called over, "What
do you want from me?"
33 They said, "Master, we want our eyes
opened. We want to see!"
34 Deeply moved, Jesus touched their
eyes. They had their sight back that very
instant, and joined the procession.
1 When they neared Jerusalem,
having arrived at Bethphage on
Mount Olives, Jesus sent two disciples
2 with these instruc ons: "Go over to
the village across from you. You'll ﬁnd a
donkey tethered there, her colt with her.
Un e her and bring them to me.
3 If anyone asks what you're doing, say,
'The Master needs them!' He will send
them with you."
4 This is the full story of what was
sketched earlier by the prophet:
5 Tell Zion's daughter, "Look, your king's
on his way, poised and ready, mounted
21MATTHEW 21
119
On a donkey, on a colt, foal of a pack
animal."
6 The disciples went and did exactly
what Jesus told them to do.
7 They led the donkey and colt out, laid
some of their clothes on them, and Jesus
mounted.
8 Nearly all the people in the crowd
threw their garments down on the road,
giving him a royal welcome. Others cut
branches from the trees and threw them
down as a welcome mat.
9 Crowds went ahead and crowds
followed, all of them calling out,
"Hosanna to David's son!" "Blessed is he
who comes in God's name!" "Hosanna in
highest heaven!"
10 As he made his entrance into
Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken.
Unnerved, people were asking, "What's
going on here? Who is this?"MATTHEW 21
120
11 The parade crowd answered, "This
is the prophet Jesus, the one from
Nazareth in Galilee."
12 Jesus went straight to the Temple
and threw out everyone who had set up
shop, buying and selling. He kicked over
the tables of loan sharks and the stalls of
dove merchants.
13 He quoted this text: My house was
designated a house of prayer; You have
made it a hangout for thieves.
14 Now there was room for the blind
and crippled to get in. They came to
Jesus and he healed them.
15 When the religious leaders saw
the outrageous things he was doing,
and heard all the children running and
shou ng through the Temple, "Hosanna
to David's Son!" they were up in arms
and took him to task.
16 "Do you hear what these children are
saying?" Jesus said, "Yes, I hear them.MATTHEW 21
121
And haven't you read in God's Word,
'From the mouths of children and babies
I'll furnish a place of praise'?"
17 Fed up, Jesus turned on his heel and
le the city for Bethany, where he spent
the night.
18 Early the next morning Jesus was
returning to the city. He was hungry.
19 Seeing a lone ﬁg tree alongside the
road, he approached it an cipa ng a
breakfast of ﬁgs. When he got to the
tree, there was nothing but ﬁg leaves. He
said, "No more ﬁgs from this tree--ever!"
The ﬁg tree withered on the spot, a dry
s ck.
20 The disciples saw it happen. They
rubbed their eyes, saying, "Did we really
see this? A leafy tree one minute, a dry
s ck the next?"
21 But Jesus was ma er-of-fact: "Yes-
-and if you embrace this kingdom life
and don't doubt God, you'll not only doMATTHEW 21
122
minor feats like I did to the ﬁg tree, but
also triumph over huge obstacles. This
mountain, for instance, you'll tell, 'Go
jump in the lake,' and it will jump.
22 Absolutely everything, ranging from
small to large, as you make it a part of
your believing prayer, gets included as
you lay hold of God."
23 Then he was back in the Temple,
teaching. The high priests and leaders
of the people came up and demanded,
"Show us your creden als. Who
authorized you to teach here?"
24 Jesus responded, "First let me ask
you a ques on. You answer my ques on
and I'll answer yours.
25 About the bap sm of John--who
authorized it: heaven or humans?" They
were on the spot and knew it. They
pulled back into a huddle and whispered,
"If we say 'heaven,' he'll ask us why we
didn't believe him;MATTHEW 21
123
26 if we say 'humans,' we're up against
it with the people because they all hold
John up as a prophet."
27 They decided to concede that
round to Jesus. "We don't know," they
answered. Jesus said, "Then neither will
I answer your ques on.
28 "Tell me what you think of this story:
A man had two sons. He went up to the
ﬁrst and said, 'Son, go out for the day
and work in the vineyard.'
29 "The son answered, 'I don't want
to.' Later on he thought be er of it and
went.
30 "The father gave the same command
to the second son. He answered, 'Sure,
glad to.' But he never went.
31 "Which of the two sons did what the
father asked?" They said, "The ﬁrst."
Jesus said, "Yes, and I tell you that crooks
and whores are going to precede you
into God's kingdom.MATTHEW 21
124
32 John came to you showing you the
right road. You turned up your noses at
him, but the crooks and whores believed
him. Even when you saw their changed
lives, you didn't care enough to change
and believe him.
33 "Here's another story. Listen closely.
There was once a man, a wealthy farmer,
who planted a vineyard. He fenced it,
dug a winepress, put up a watchtower,
then turned it over to the farmhands
and went oﬀ on a trip.
34 When it was me to harvest the
grapes, he sent his servants back to
collect his proﬁts.
35 "The farmhands grabbed the ﬁrst
servant and beat him up. The next one
they murdered. They threw stones at
the third but he got away.
36 The owner tried again, sending more
servants. They got the same treatment.MATTHEW 21
125
37 The owner was at the end of his rope.
He decided to send his son. 'Surely,' he
thought, 'they will respect my son.'
38 "But when the farmhands saw the
son arrive, they rubbed their hands in
greed. 'This is the heir! Let's kill him and
have it all for ourselves.'
39 They grabbed him, threw him out,
and killed him.
40 "Now, when the owner of the
vineyard arrives home from his trip,
what do you think he will do to the
farmhands?"
41 "He'll kill them--a ro en bunch, and
good riddance," they answered. "Then
he'll assign the vineyard to farmhands
who will hand over the proﬁts when it's
me."
42 Jesus said, "Right--and you can read
it for yourselves in your Bibles: The
stone the masons threw out is now theMATTHEW 21 – 22
126
cornerstone. This is God's work; we rub
our eyes, we can hardly believe it!
43 "This is the way it is with you. God's
kingdom will be taken back from you
and handed over to a people who will
live out a kingdom life.
44 Whoever stumbles on this Stone gets
sha ered; whoever the Stone falls on
gets smashed."
45 When the religious leaders heard this
story, they knew it was aimed at them.
46 They wanted to arrest Jesus and put
him in jail, but, in midated by public
opinion, they held back. Most people
held him to be a prophet of God.
1 Jesus responded by telling s ll
more stories.
2 "God's kingdom," he said, "is like a
king who threw a wedding banquet for
his son.
3 He sent out servants to call in all the
invited guests. And they wouldn't come!
22MATTHEW 22
127
4 "He sent out another round of
servants, instruc ng them to tell the
guests, 'Look, everything is on the table,
the prime rib is ready for carving. Come
to the feast!'
5 "They only shrugged their shoulders
and went oﬀ, one to weed his garden,
another to work in his shop.
6 The rest, with nothing be er to do,
beat up on the messengers and then
killed them.
7 The king was outraged and sent his
soldiers to destroy those thugs and level
their city.
8 "Then he told his servants, 'We have
a wedding banquet all prepared but no
guests. The ones I invited weren't up to
it.
9 Go out into the busiest intersec ons
in town and invite anyone you ﬁnd to
the banquet.'MATTHEW 22
128
10 The servants went out on the streets
and rounded up everyone they laid eyes
on, good and bad, regardless. And so the
banquet was on--every place ﬁlled.
11 "When the king entered and looked
over the scene, he spo ed a man who
wasn't properly dressed.
12 He said to him, 'Friend, how dare you
come in here looking like that!' The man
was speechless.
13 Then the king told his servants, 'Get
him out of here--fast. Tie him up and
ship him to hell. And make sure he
doesn't get back in.'
14 "That's what I mean when I say,
'Many get invited; only a few make it.'"
15 That's when the Pharisees plo ed a
way to trap him into saying something
damaging.
16 They sent their disciples, with a few
of Herod's followers mixed in, to ask,
"Teacher, we know you have integrity,MATTHEW 22
129
teach the way of God accurately, are
indiﬀerent to popular opinion, and don't
pander to your students.
17 So tell us honestly: Is it right to pay
taxes to Caesar or not?"
18 Jesus knew they were up to no good.
He said, "Why are you playing these
games with me? Why are you trying to
trap me?
19 Do you have a coin? Let me see it."
They handed him a silver piece.
20 "This engraving--who does it look
like? And whose name is on it?"
21 They said, "Caesar." "Then give
Caesar what is his, and give God what is
his."
22 The Pharisees were speechless. They
went oﬀ shaking their heads.
23 That same day, Sadducees
approached him. This is the party that
denies any possibility of resurrec on.MATTHEW 22
130
24 They asked, "Teacher, Moses said
that if a man dies childless, his brother
is obligated to marry his widow and get
her with child.
25 Here's a case where there were
seven brothers. The ﬁrst brother married
and died, leaving no child, and his wife
passed to his brother.
26 The second brother also le her
childless, then the third--and on and on,
all seven.
27 Eventually the wife died.
28 Now here's our ques on: At the
resurrec on, whose wife is she? She was
a wife to each of them."
29 Jesus answered, "You're oﬀ base on
two counts: You don't know your Bibles,
and you don't know how God works.
30 At the resurrec on we're beyond
marriage. As with the angels, all our
ecstasies and in macies then will be
with God.MATTHEW 22
31 And regarding your specula
131
on
on whether the dead are raised or
not, don't you read your Bibles? The
grammar is clear: God says,
32 'I am--not was--the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.' The
living God deﬁnes himself not as the God
of dead men, but of the living."
33 Hearing this exchange the crowd was
much impressed.
34 When the Pharisees heard how
he had bested the Sadducees, they
gathered their forces for an assault.
35 One of their religion scholars spoke
for them, posing a ques on they hoped
would show him up:
36 "Teacher, which command in God's
Law is the most important?"
37 Jesus said, "'Love the Lord your God
with all your passion and prayer and
intelligence.'MATTHEW 22
132
38 This is the most important, the ﬁrst
on any list.
39 But there is a second to set alongside
it: 'Love others as well as you love
yourself.'
40 These two commands are pegs;
everything in God's Law and the
Prophets hangs from them."
41 As the Pharisees were regrouping,
Jesus caught them oﬀ balance with his
own test ques on:
42 "What do you think about the Christ?
Whose son is he?" They said, "David's
son."
43 Jesus replied, "Well, if the Christ is
David's son, how do you explain that
David, under inspira on, named Christ
his 'Master'?
44 God said to my Master, "Sit here at
my right hand un l I make your enemies
your footstool."MATTHEW 22 – 23
133
45 "Now if David calls him 'Master,' how
can he at the same me be his son?"
46 That stumped them, literalists that
they were. Unwilling to risk losing face
again in one of these public verbal
exchanges, they quit asking ques ons
for good.
1 Now Jesus turned to address his
disciples, along with the crowd
that had gathered with them.
2 "The religion scholars and Pharisees
are competent teachers in God's Law.
3 You won't go wrong in following their
teachings on Moses. But be careful
about following them. They talk a good
line, but they don't live it. They don't
take it into their hearts and live it out
in their behavior. It's all spit-and-polish
veneer.
4 "Instead of giving you God's Law
as food and drink by which you can
banquet on God, they package it in
23MATTHEW 23
134
bundles of rules, loading you down
like pack animals. They seem to take
pleasure in watching you stagger under
these loads, and wouldn't think of li ing
a ﬁnger to help.
5 Their lives are perpetual fashion
shows, embroidered prayer shawls one
day and ﬂowery prayers the next.
6 They love to sit at the head table at
church dinners, basking in the most
prominent posi ons,
7 preening in the radiance of public
ﬂa ery, receiving honorary degrees, and
ge ng called 'Doctor' and 'Reverend.'
8 "Don't let people do that to you,
put you on a pedestal like that. You all
have a single Teacher, and you are all
classmates.
9 Don't set people up as experts over
your life, le ng them tell you what to
do. Save that authority for God; let him
tell you what to do. No one else shouldMATTHEW 23

one Father, and he's in heaven.
10 And don't let people maneuver
you into taking charge of them. There
is only one Life-Leader for you and
them--Christ.
11 "Do you want to stand out? Then
step down. Be a servant.
12 If you puﬀ yourself up, you'll get the
wind knocked out of you. But if you're
content to simply be yourself, your life
will count for plenty.
13 "I've had it with you! You're hopeless,
you religion scholars, you Pharisees!
Frauds! Your lives are roadblocks to
God's kingdom. You refuse to enter, and
won't let anyone else in either.

scholars and Pharisees! Frauds! You

16 "You're hopeless! What arrogant
stupidity! You say, 'If someone makes a
promise with his ﬁngers crossed, that's
nothing; but if he swears with his hand
on the Bible, that's serious.'
17 What ignorance! Does the leather
on the Bible carry more weight than the
skin on your hands?
18 And what about this piece of trivia:
'If you shake hands on a promise, that's
nothing; but if you raise your hand that
God is your witness, that's serious'?
19 What ridiculous hairspli ng! What
diﬀerence does it make whether you
shake hands or raise hands?
20 A promise is a promise. What
diﬀerence does it make if you make your
promise inside or outside a house of
worship? A promise is a promise. GodMATTHEW 23
137
is present, watching and holding you to
account regardless.
23 "You're hopeless, you religion
scholars and Pharisees! Frauds! You keep
me culous account books, thing on
every nickel and dime you get, but on the
meat of God's Law, things like fairness
and compassion and commitment--the
absolute basics!--you carelessly take
it or leave it. Careful bookkeeping
is commendable, but the basics are
required.
24 Do you have any idea how silly you
look, wri ng a life story that's wrong
from start to ﬁnish, nitpicking over
commas and semicolons?
25 "You're hopeless, you religion
scholars and Pharisees! Frauds! You
burnish the surface of your cups and
bowls so they sparkle in the sun, while

138
26 Stupid Pharisee! Scour the insides,
and then the gleaming surface will mean
something.
27 "You're hopeless, you religion
scholars and Pharisees! Frauds! You're
like manicured grave plots, grass clipped

build granite tombs for your prophets
and marble monuments for your saints.
30 And you say that if you had lived in

would have been on your hands.
31 You protest too much! You're cut

33 "Snakes! Rep

1 Jesus then le the Temple. As
he walked away, his disciples
pointed out how very impressive the
Temple architecture was.
2 Jesus said, "You're not impressed by
all this sheer size, are you? The truth of
the ma er is that there's not a stone in
that building that is not going to end up
in a pile of rubble."
3 Later as he was si ng on Mount
Olives, his disciples approached and
asked him, "Tell us, when are these
things going to happen? What will be
24MATTHEW 24
141
the sign of your coming, that the me's
up?"
4 Jesus said, "Watch out for doomsday
deceivers.
5 Many leaders are going to show up
with forged iden es, claiming, 'I am
Christ, the Messiah.' They will deceive a
lot of people.
6 When reports come in of wars and
rumored wars, keep your head and don't
panic. This is rou ne history; this is no
sign of the end.
7 Na on will ﬁght na on and ruler
ﬁght ruler, over and over. Famines and
earthquakes will occur in various places.
8 This is nothing compared to what is
coming.
9 "They are going to throw you to the
wolves and kill you, everyone ha ng you
because you carry my name.
10 And then, going from bad to worse,
it will be dog-eat-dog, everyone at eachMATTHEW 24
142
other's throat, everyone ha ng each
other.
11 "In the confusion, lying preachers
will come forward and deceive a lot of
people.
12 For many others, the overwhelming
spread of evil will do them in--nothing
le of their love but a mound of ashes.
13 "Staying with it--that's what God
requires. Stay with it to the end. You
won't be sorry, and you'll be saved.
14 All during this me, the good
news--the Message of the kingdom--will
be preached all over the world, a witness
staked out in every country. And then
the end will come.
15 "But be ready to run for it when you
see the monster of desecra on set up
in the Temple sanctuary. The prophet
Daniel described this. If you've read
Daniel, you'll know what I'm talking
about.MATTHEW 24
16 If you're living in Judea at the
143
me,
run for the hills;
17 if you're working in the yard, don't
return to the house to get anything;
18 if you're out in the ﬁeld, don't go
back and get your coat.
19 Pregnant and nursing mothers will
have it especially hard.
20 Hope and pray this won't happen
during the winter or on a Sabbath.
21 "This is going to be trouble on a scale
beyond what the world has ever seen, or
will see again.
22 If these days of trouble were le to
run their course, nobody would make it.
But on account of God's chosen people,
the trouble will be cut short.
23 "If anyone tries to ﬂag you down,
calling out, 'Here's the Messiah!' or
points, 'There he is!' don't fall for it.
24 Fake Messiahs and lying preachers
are going to pop up everywhere. TheirMATTHEW 24
144
impressive creden als and dazzling
performances will pull the wool over the
eyes of even those who ought to know

25 But I've given you fair warning.
26 "So if they say, 'Run to the country
and see him arrive!' or, 'Quick, get
downtown, see him come!' don't give
them the me of day.
27 The Arrival of the Son of Man isn't
something you go to see. He comes like
swi lightning to you!
28 Whenever you see crowds gathering,
think of carrion vultures circling, moving
in, hovering over a ro ng carcass. You
can be quite sure that it's not the living
Son of Man pulling in those crowds.
29 "Following those hard mes, Sun will
fade out, moon cloud over, Stars fall out
of the sky, cosmic powers tremble.
30 "Then, the Arrival of the Son of Man!
It will ﬁll the skies--no one will missMATTHEW 24
145
it. Unready people all over the world,
outsiders to the splendor and power, will
raise a huge lament as they watch the
Son of Man blazing out of heaven.
31 At that same moment, he'll dispatch
his angels with a trumpet-blast
summons, pulling in God's chosen from
the four winds, from pole to pole.
32 "Take a lesson from the ﬁg tree. From
the moment you no ce its buds form,
the merest hint of green, you know
summer's just around the corner.
33 So it is with you: When you see all
these things, you'll know he's at the
door.
34 Don't take this lightly. I'm not just
saying this for some future genera on,
but for all of you. This age con nues
un l all these things take place.
35 Sky and earth will wear out; my
words won't wear out.MATTHEW 24
146
36 "But the exact day and hour? No one
knows that, not even heaven's angels,
not even the Son. Only the Father knows.
37 "The Arrival of the Son of Man will
take place in mes like Noah's.
38 Before the great ﬂood everyone was
carrying on as usual, having a good me
right up to the day Noah boarded the
ark.
39 They knew nothing--un l the ﬂood
hit and swept everything away. "The Son
of Man's Arrival will be like that:
40 Two men will be working in the
ﬁeld--one will be taken, one le behind;
41 two women will be grinding at the
mill--one will be taken, one le behind.
42 So stay awake, alert. You have no
idea what day your Master will show up.
43 But you do know this: You know that
if the homeowner had known what me
of night the burglar would arrive, heMATTHEW 24
147
would have been there with his dogs to
prevent the break-in.
44 Be vigilant just like that. You have no
idea when the Son of Man is going to
show up.
45 "Who here qualiﬁes for the job of
overseeing the kitchen? A person the
Master can depend on to feed the
workers on me each day.
46 Someone the Master can drop in on
unannounced and always ﬁnd him doing
his job. A God-blessed man or woman, I
tell you.
47 It won't be long before the Master
will put this person in charge of the
whole opera on.
48 "But if that person only looks out for
himself, and the minute the Master is
away does what he pleases--
49 abusing the help and throwing
drunken par es for his friends--MATTHEW 24 – 25
148
50 the Master is going to show up when
he least expects it
51 and make hash of him. He'll end up
in the dump with the hypocrites, out in
the cold shivering, teeth cha ering.
1 "God's kingdom is like ten young
virgins who took oil lamps and
went out to greet the bridegroom.
2 Five were silly and ﬁve were smart.
3 The silly virgins took lamps, but no
extra oil.
4 The smart virgins took jars of oil to
feed their lamps.
5 The bridegroom didn't show up when
they expected him, and they all fell
asleep.
6 "In the middle of the night someone
yelled out, 'He's here! The bridegroom's
here! Go out and greet him!'
7 "The ten virgins got up and got their
lamps ready.
25MATTHEW 25
149
8 The silly virgins said to the smart ones,
'Our lamps are going out; lend us some
of your oil.'
9 "They answered, 'There might not be
enough to go around; go buy your own.'
10 "They did, but while they were out
buying oil, the bridegroom arrived.
When everyone who was there to greet
him had gone into the wedding feast,
the door was locked.
11 "Much later, the other virgins, the
silly ones, showed up and knocked on
the door, saying, 'Master, we're here. Let
us in.'
12 "He answered, 'Do I know you? I
don't think I know you.'
13 "So stay alert. You have no idea when
he might arrive.
14 "It's also like a man going oﬀ on an
extended trip. He called his servants
together and delegated responsibili es.MATTHEW 25
150
15 To one he gave ﬁve thousand dollars,
to another two thousand, to a third one
thousand, depending on their abili es.
Then he le .
16 Right oﬀ, the ﬁrst servant went
to work and doubled his master's
investment.
17 The second did the same.
18 But the man with the single thousand
dug a hole and carefully buried his
master's money.
19 "A er a long absence, the master
of those three servants came back and
se led up with them.
20 The one given ﬁve thousand dollars
showed him how he had doubled his
investment.
21 His master commended him: 'Good
work! You did your job well. From now
on be my partner.'MATTHEW 25
151
22 "The servant with the two thousand
showed how he also had doubled his
master's investment.
23 His master commended him: 'Good
work! You did your job well. From now
on be my partner.'
24 "The servant given one thousand
said, 'Master, I know you have high
standards and hate careless ways, that
you demand the best and make no
allowances for error.
25 I was afraid I might disappoint you, so
I found a good hiding place and secured
your money. Here it is, safe and sound
down to the last cent.'
26 "The master was furious. 'That's a
terrible way to live! It's criminal to live
cau ously like that! If you knew I was
a er the best, why did you do less than
the least?
27 The least you could have done would
have been to invest the sum with theMATTHEW 25
152
bankers, where at least I would have
go en a li le interest.
28 "'Take the thousand and give it to the
one who risked the most. And get rid of
this "play-it-safe" who won't go out on a
limb.
30 Throw him out into u er darkness.'
31 "When he ﬁnally arrives, blazing in
beauty and all his angels with him, the
Son of Man will take his place on his
glorious throne.
32 Then all the na ons will be arranged
before him and he will sort the people
out, much as a shepherd sorts out sheep
and goats,
33 pu ng sheep to his right and goats
to his le .
34 "Then the King will say to those on
his right, 'Enter, you who are blessed by
my Father! Take what's coming to you
in this kingdom. It's been ready for you
since the world's founda on.MATTHEW 25
153
35 And here's why: I was hungry and
you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave
me a drink, I was homeless and you gave
me a room,
36 I was shivering and you gave me
clothes, I was sick and you stopped to
visit, I was in prison and you came to
me.'
37 "Then those 'sheep' are going to say,
'Master, what are you talking about?
When did we ever see you hungry and
feed you, thirsty and give you a drink?
38 And when did we ever see you sick or
in prison and come to you?'
40 Then the King will say, 'I'm telling the
solemn truth: Whenever you did one of
these things to someone overlooked or
ignored, that was me--you did it to me.'
41 "Then he will turn to the 'goats,'
the ones on his le , and say, 'Get out,
worthless goats! You're good for nothing
but the ﬁres of hell.MATTHEW 25 – 26
154
42 And why? Because--I was hungry and
you gave me no meal, I was thirsty and
you gave me no drink,
43 I was homeless and you gave me no
bed, I was shivering and you gave me
no clothes, Sick and in prison, and you
never visited.'
44 "Then those 'goats' are going to say,
'Master, what are you talking about?
When did we ever see you hungry or
thirsty or homeless or shivering or sick
or in prison and didn't help?'
45 "He will answer them, 'I'm telling the
solemn truth: Whenever you failed to
do one of these things to someone who
was being overlooked or ignored, that
was me--you failed to do it to me.'
46 "Then those 'goats' will be herded to
their eternal doom, but the 'sheep' to
their eternal reward."
1 When Jesus ﬁnished saying
these things, he told his disciples,
26MATTHEW 26
155
2 "You know that Passover comes in
two days. That's when the Son of Man
will be betrayed and handed over for
cruciﬁxion."
3 At that very moment, the party of
high priests and religious leaders was
mee ng in the chambers of the Chief
Priest named Caiaphas,
4 conspiring to seize Jesus by stealth
and kill him.
5 They agreed that it should not be
done during Passover Week. "We don't
want a riot on our hands," they said.
6 When Jesus was at Bethany, a guest of
Simon the Leper,
7 a woman came up to him as he was
ea ng dinner and anointed him with a
bo le of very expensive perfume.
8 When the disciples saw what was
happening, they were furious. "That's
criminal!MATTHEW 26
156
9 This could have been sold for a lot and
the money handed out to the poor."
10 When Jesus realized what was going
on, he intervened. "Why are you giving
this woman a hard me? She has just
done something wonderfully signiﬁcant
for me.
11 You will have the poor with you every
day for the rest of your lives, but not me.
12 When she poured this perfume on
my body, what she really did was anoint
me for burial.
13 You can be sure that wherever in the
whole world the Message is preached,
what she has just done is going to be
remembered and admired."
14 That is when one of the Twelve, the
one named Judas Iscariot, went to the
cabal of high priests
15 and said, "What will you give me if I
hand him over to you?" They se led on
thirty silver pieces.MATTHEW 26
157
16 He began looking for just the right
moment to hand him over.
17 On the ﬁrst of the Days of Unleavened
Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and
said, "Where do you want us to prepare
your Passover meal?"
18 He said, "Enter the city. Go up to a
certain man and say, 'The Teacher says,
My me is near. I and my disciples plan
to celebrate the Passover meal at your
house.'"
19 The disciples followed Jesus'
instruc ons to the le er, and prepared
the Passover meal.
20 A er sunset, he and the Twelve were
si ng around the table.
21 During the meal, he said, "I have
something hard but important to say to
you: One of you is going to hand me over
to the conspirators."MATTHEW 26
158
22 They were stunned, and then began
to ask, one a er another, "It isn't me, is
it, Master?"
23 Jesus answered, "The one who hands
me over is someone I eat with daily, one
who passes me food at the table.
24 In one sense the Son of Man is
entering into a way of treachery well-
marked by the Scriptures--no surprises
here. In another sense that man who
turns him in, turns traitor to the Son of
Man--be er never to have been born
than do this!"
25 Then Judas, already turned traitor,
said, "It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?" Jesus said,
"Don't play games with me, Judas."
26 During the meal, Jesus took and
blessed the bread, broke it, and gave
it to his disciples: Take, eat. This is my
body.
27 Taking the cup and thanking God, he
gave it to them: Drink this, all of you.MATTHEW 26
159
28 This is my blood, God's new covenant
poured out for many people for the
forgiveness of sins.
29 "I'll not be drinking wine from this
cup again un l that new day when I'll
drink with you in the kingdom of my
Father."
30 They sang a hymn and went directly
to Mount Olives.
31 Then Jesus told them, "Before the
night's over, you're going to fall to pieces
because of what happens to me. There
is a Scripture that says, I'll strike the
shepherd; helter-skelter the sheep will
be sca ered.
32 But a er I am raised up, I, your
Shepherd, will go ahead of you, leading
the way to Galilee."
33 Peter broke in, "Even if everyone
else falls to pieces on account of you, I
won't."MATTHEW 26
160
34 "Don't be so sure," Jesus said. "This
very night, before the rooster crows up
the dawn, you will deny me three mes."
35 Peter protested, "Even if I had to die
with you, I would never deny you." All
the others said the same thing.
36 Then Jesus went with them to a
garden called Gethsemane and told his
disciples, "Stay here while I go over there
and pray."
37 Taking along Peter and the two sons
of Zebedee, he plunged into an agonizing
sorrow.
38 Then he said, "This sorrow is crushing
my life out. Stay here and keep vigil with
me."
39 Going a li le ahead, he fell on his
face, praying, "My Father, if there is any
way, get me out of this. But please, not
what I want. You, what do you want?"
40 When he came back to his disciples,
he found them sound asleep. He said toMATTHEW 26
161
Peter, "Can't you s ck it out with me a
single hour?
41 Stay alert; be in prayer so you don't
wander into tempta on without even
knowing you're in danger. There is a part
of you that is eager, ready for anything
in God. But there's another part that's as
lazy as an old dog sleeping by the ﬁre."
42 He then le them a second me.
Again he prayed, "My Father, if there is
no other way than this, drinking this cup
to the dregs, I'm ready. Do it your way."
43 When he came back, he again found
them sound asleep. They simply couldn't
keep their eyes open.
44 This me he let them sleep on, and
went back a third me to pray, going
over the same ground one last me.
45 When he came back the next me,
he said, "Are you going to sleep on and
make a night of it? My me is up, theMATTHEW 26
162
Son of Man is about to be handed over
to the hands of sinners.
46 Get up! Let's get going! My betrayer
is here."
47 The words were barely out of his
mouth when Judas (the one from the
Twelve) showed up, and with him a
gang from the high priests and religious
leaders brandishing swords and clubs.
48 The betrayer had worked out a sign
with them: "The one I kiss, that's the
one--seize him."
49 He went straight to Jesus, greeted
him, "How are you, Rabbi?" and kissed
him.
50 Jesus said, "Friend, why this
charade?" Then they came on him--
grabbed him and roughed him up.
51 One of those with Jesus pulled his
sword and, taking a swing at the Chief
Priest's servant, cut oﬀ his ear.MATTHEW 26
163
52 Jesus said, "Put your sword back
where it belongs. All who use swords are
destroyed by swords.
53 Don't you realize that I am able
right now to call to my Father, and
twelve companies--more, if I want
them--of ﬁgh ng angels would be here,
ba le-ready?
54 But if I did that, how would the
Scriptures come true that say this is the
way it has to be?"
55 Then Jesus addressed the mob:
"What is this--coming out a er me with
swords and clubs as if I were a dangerous
criminal? Day a er day I have been
si ng in the Temple teaching, and you
never so much as li ed a hand against
me.
56 You've done it this way to conﬁrm
and fulﬁll the prophe c wri ngs." Then
all the disciples cut and ran.MATTHEW 26
164
57 The gang that had seized Jesus led
him before Caiaphas the Chief Priest,
where the religion scholars and leaders
had assembled.
58 Peter followed at a safe distance un l
they got to the Chief Priest's courtyard.
Then he slipped in and mingled with the
servants, watching to see how things
would turn out.
59 The high priests, conspiring with the
Jewish Council, tried to cook up charges
against Jesus in order to sentence him to
death.
60 But even though many stepped up,
making up one false accusa on a er
another, nothing was believable. Finally
two men came forward
61 with this: "He said, 'I can tear down
this Temple of God and a er three days
rebuild it.'"MATTHEW 26
165
62 The Chief Priest stood up and
said, "What do you have to say to the
accusa on?"
63 Jesus kept silent. Then the Chief
Priest said, "I command you by the
authority of the living God to say if you
are the Messiah, the Son of God."
64 Jesus was curt: "You yourself said it.
And that's not all. Soon you'll see it for
yourself: The Son of Man seated at the
right hand of the Mighty One, Arriving
on the clouds of heaven."
65 At that, the Chief Priest lost his
temper, ripping his robes, yelling, "He
blasphemed! Why do we need witnesses
to accuse him? You all heard him
blaspheme!
66 Are you going to stand for such
blasphemy?" They all said, "Death! That
seals his death sentence."MATTHEW 26
67 Then they were spi
166
ng in his face
and banging him around. They jeered as
they slapped him:
68 "Prophesy, Messiah: Who hit you
that me?"
69 All this me, Peter was si ng out in
the courtyard. One servant girl came up
to him and said, "You were with Jesus
the Galilean."
70 In front of everybody there, he
denied it. "I don't know what you're
talking about."
71 As he moved over toward the gate,
someone else said to the people there,
"This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
72 Again he denied it, sal ng his denial
with an oath: "I swear, I never laid eyes
on the man."
73 Shortly a er that, some bystanders
approached Peter. "You've got to be one
of them. Your accent gives you away."MATTHEW 26 – 27
167
74 Then he got really nervous and
swore. "I don't know the man!" Just then
a rooster crowed.
75 Peter remembered what Jesus had
said: "Before the rooster crows, you will
deny me three mes." He went out and
cried and cried and cried.
1 In the ﬁrst light of dawn, all the
high priests and religious leaders
met and put the ﬁnishing touches on
their plot to kill Jesus.
2 Then they ed him up and paraded
him to Pilate, the governor.
3 Judas, the one who betrayed him,
realized that Jesus was doomed.
Overcome with remorse, he gave back
the thirty silver coins to the high priests,
4 saying, "I've sinned. I've betrayed an
innocent man." They said, "What do we
care? That's your problem!"
27MATTHEW 27
168
5 Judas threw the silver coins into the
Temple and le . Then he went out and
hung himself.
6 The high priests picked up the silver
pieces, but then didn't know what to
do with them. "It wouldn't be right to
give this--a payment for murder!--as an
oﬀering in the Temple."
7 They decided to get rid of it by buying
the "Po er's Field" and use it as a burial
place for the homeless.
8 That's how the ﬁeld got called
"Murder Meadow," a name that has
stuck to this day.
9 Then Jeremiah's words became
history: They took the thirty silver
pieces, The price of the one priced by
some sons of Israel,
10 And they purchased the po er's
ﬁeld. And so they unwi ngly followed
the divine instruc ons to the le er.MATTHEW 27
169
11 Jesus was placed before the governor,
who ques oned him: "Are you the 'King
of the Jews'?" Jesus said, "If you say so."
12 But when the accusa ons rained
down hot and heavy from the high
priests and religious leaders, he said
nothing.
13 Pilate asked him, "Do you hear that
long list of accusa ons? Aren't you going
to say something?"
14 Jesus kept silence--not a word from
his mouth. The governor was impressed,
really impressed.
15 It was an old custom during the Feast
for the governor to pardon a single
prisoner named by the crowd.
16 At the me, they had the infamous
Jesus Barabbas in prison.
17 With the crowd before him, Pilate
said, "Which prisoner do you want me
to pardon: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus the
so-called Christ?"MATTHEW 27
170
18 He knew it was through sheer spite
that they had turned Jesus over to him.
19 While court was s ll in session,
Pilate's wife sent him a message: "Don't
get mixed up in judging this noble
man. I've just been through a long and
troubled night because of a dream about
him."
20 Meanwhile, the high priests and
religious leaders had talked the crowd
into asking for the pardon of Barabbas
and the execu on of Jesus.
21 The governor asked, "Which of the
two do you want me to pardon?" They
said, "Barabbas!"
22 "Then what do I do with Jesus, the
so-called Christ?" They all shouted, "Nail
him to a cross!"
23 He objected, "But for what crime?"
But they yelled all the louder, "Nail him
to a cross!"MATTHEW 27
24 When Pilate saw that he was ge
171
ng
nowhere and that a riot was imminent,
he took a basin of water and washed his
hands in full sight of the crowd, saying,
"I'm washing my hands of responsibility
for this man's death. From now on, it's in
your hands. You're judge and jury."
25 The crowd answered, "We'll take the
blame, we and our children a er us."
26 Then he pardoned Barabbas. But he
had Jesus whipped, and then handed
over for cruciﬁxion.
27 The soldiers assigned to the governor
took Jesus into the governor's palace
and got the en re brigade together for
some fun.
28 They stripped him and dressed him
in a red toga.
29 They plaited a crown from branches
of a thorn bush and set it on his head.
They put a s ck in his right hand for a
scepter. Then they knelt before him inMATTHEW 27
172
mocking reverence: "Bravo, King of the
Jews!" they said. "Bravo!"
30 Then they spit on him and hit him on
the head with the s ck.
31 When they had had their fun, they
took oﬀ the toga and put his own clothes
back on him. Then they proceeded out
to the cruciﬁxion.
32 Along the way they came on a man
from Cyrene named Simon and made
him carry Jesus' cross.
33 Arriving at Golgotha, the place they
call "Skull Hill,"
34 they oﬀered him a mild painkiller (a
mixture of wine and myrrh), but when
he tasted it he wouldn't drink it.
35 A er they had ﬁnished nailing him
to the cross and were wai ng for him
to die, they whiled away the me by
throwing dice for his clothes.MATTHEW 27
173
37 Above his head they had posted the
criminal charge against him: THIS IS
JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
38 Along with him, they also cruciﬁed
two criminals, one to his right, the other
to his le .
39 People passing along the road jeered,
shaking their heads in mock lament:
40 "You bragged that you could tear
down the Temple and then rebuild it in
three days--so show us your stuﬀ! Save
yourself! If you're really God's Son, come
down from that cross!"
41 The high priests, along with the
religion scholars and leaders, were right
there mixing it up with the rest of them,
having a great me poking fun at him:
42 "He saved others--he can't save
himself! King of Israel, is he? Then let
him get down from that cross. We'll all
become believers then!MATTHEW 27
174
43 He was so sure of God--well, let him
rescue his 'Son' now--if he wants him!
He did claim to be God's Son, didn't he?"
44 Even the two criminals cruciﬁed next
to him joined in the mockery.
45 From noon to three, the whole earth
was dark.
46 Around mid-a ernoon Jesus groaned
out of the depths, crying loudly, ["Eli, Eli,
lama sabachthani?"] which means, "My
God, my God, why have you abandoned
me?"
47 Some bystanders who heard him
said, "He's calling for Elijah."
48 One of them ran and got a sponge
soaked in sour wine and li ed it on a
s ck so he could drink.
49 The others joked, "Don't be in such a
hurry. Let's see if Elijah comes and saves
him."
50 But Jesus, again crying out loudly,
breathed his last.MATTHEW 27
175
51 At that moment, the Temple curtain
was ripped in two, top to bo om. There
was an earthquake, and rocks were split
in pieces.
52 What's more, tombs were opened
up, and many bodies of believers asleep
in their graves were raised.
53 (A er Jesus' resurrec on, they le
the tombs, entered the holy city, and
appeared to many.)
54 The captain of the guard and those
with him, when they saw the earthquake
and everything else that was happening,
were scared to death. They said, "This
has to be the Son of God!"
55 There were also quite a few women
watching from a distance, women who
had followed Jesus from Galilee in order
to serve him.
56 Among them were Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of James and Joseph,
and the mother of the Zebedee brothers.MATTHEW 27
57 Late in the a
176
ernoon a wealthy man
from Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus,
arrived. His name was Joseph.
58 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus'
body. Pilate granted his request.
59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it
in clean linens,
60 put it in his own tomb, a new tomb
only recently cut into the rock, and rolled
a large stone across the entrance. Then
he went oﬀ.
61 But Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary stayed, si ng in plain view of the
tomb.
62 A er sundown, the high priests
and Pharisees arranged a mee ng with
Pilate.
63 They said, "Sir, we just remembered
that that liar announced while he was
s ll alive, 'A er three days I will be
raised.'MATTHEW 27 – 28
177
64 We've got to get that tomb sealed
un l the third day. There's a good chance
his disciples will come and steal the
corpse and then go around saying, 'He's
risen from the dead.' Then we'll be
worse oﬀ than before, the ﬁnal deceit
surpassing the ﬁrst."
65 Pilate told them, "You will have a
guard. Go ahead and secure it the best
you can."
66 So they went out and secured the
tomb, sealing the stone and pos ng
guards.
1 A er the Sabbath, as the ﬁrst
light of the new week dawned,
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
came to keep vigil at the tomb.
2 Suddenly the earth reeled and rocked
under their feet as God's angel came
down from heaven, came right up to
where they were standing. He rolled
back the stone and then sat on it.
28MATTHEW 28
3 Sha
178
s of lightning blazed from him.
His garments shimmered snow-white.
4 The guards at the tomb were scared
to death. They were so frightened, they
couldn't move.
5 The angel spoke to the women: "There
is nothing to fear here. I know you're
looking for Jesus, the One they nailed to
the cross.
6 He is not here. He was raised, just
as he said. Come and look at the place
where he was placed.
7 "Now, get on your way quickly and
tell his disciples, 'He is risen from the
dead. He is going on ahead of you to
Galilee. You will see him there.' That's
the message."
8 The women, deep in wonder and full
of joy, lost no me in leaving the tomb.
They ran to tell the disciples.
9 Then Jesus met them, stopping them
in their tracks. "Good morning!" he said.MATTHEW 28
179
They fell to their knees, embraced his
feet, and worshiped him.
10 Jesus said, "You're holding on to me
for dear life! Don't be frightened like
that. Go tell my brothers that they are
to go to Galilee, and that I'll meet them
there."
11 Meanwhile, the guards had sca ered,
but a few of them went into the city and
told the high priests everything that had
happened.
12 They called a mee ng of the religious
leaders and came up with a plan: They
took a large sum of money and gave it to
the soldiers,
13 bribing them to say, "His disciples
came in the night and stole the body
while we were sleeping."
14 They assured them, "If the governor
hears about your sleeping on duty, we
will make sure you don't get blamed."MATTHEW 28
180
15 The soldiers took the bribe and did
as they were told. That story, cooked up
in the Jewish High Council, is s ll going
around.
16 Meanwhile, the eleven disciples
were on their way to Galilee, headed
for the mountain Jesus had set for their
reunion.
17 The moment they saw him they
worshiped him. Some, though, held
back, not sure about [worship], about
risking themselves totally.
18 Jesus, undeterred, went right ahead
and gave his charge: "God authorized
and commanded me to commission you:
19 Go out and train everyone you meet,
far and near, in this way of life, marking
them by bap sm in the threefold name:
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
20 Then instruct them in the prac ce of
all I have commanded you. I'll be withMATTHEW 28
181
you as you do this, day a er day a er
day, right up to the end of the age."Mark
1
1 The good news of Jesus Christ--the
Message!--begins here,
2 following to the le er the scroll of
the prophet Isaiah. Watch closely: I'm
sending my preacher ahead of you; He'll
make the road smooth for you.
3 Thunder in the desert! Prepare for
God's arrival! Make the road smooth
and straight!
4 John the Bap zer appeared in the
wild, preaching a bap sm of life-change
that leads to forgiveness of sins.
5 People thronged to him from Judea
and Jerusalem and, as they confessed
their sins, were bap zed by him in the
Jordan River into a changed life.MARK 1
6 John wore a camel-hair habit,
2
ed
at the waist with a leather belt. He ate
locusts and wild ﬁeld honey.
7 As he preached he said, "The real
ac on comes next: The star in this
drama, to whom I'm a mere stagehand,
will change your life.
8 I'm bap zing you here in the river,
turning your old life in for a kingdom life.
His bap sm--a holy bap sm by the Holy
Spirit--will change you from the inside
out."
9 At this me, Jesus came from Nazareth
in Galilee and was bap zed by John in
the Jordan.
10 The moment he came out of the
water, he saw the sky split open and
God's Spirit, looking like a dove, come
down on him.
11 Along with the Spirit, a voice: "You
are my Son, chosen and marked by my
love, pride of my life."MARK 1
3
12 At once, this same Spirit pushed
Jesus out into the wild.
13 For forty wilderness days and nights
he was tested by Satan. Wild animals
were his companions, and angels took
care of him.
14 A er John was arrested, Jesus went
to Galilee preaching the Message of
God:
15 "Time's up! God's kingdom is
here. Change your life and believe the
Message."
16 Passing along the beach of Lake
Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother
Andrew net-ﬁshing. Fishing was their
regular work.
17 Jesus said to them, "Come with me.
I'll make a new kind of ﬁsherman out of
you. I'll show you how to catch men and
women instead of perch and bass."
18 They didn't ask ques ons. They
dropped their nets and followed.MARK 1
4
19 A dozen yards or so down the beach,
he saw the brothers James and John,
Zebedee's sons. They were in the boat,
mending their ﬁshnets.
20 Right oﬀ, he made the same oﬀer.
Immediately, they le their father
Zebedee, the boat, and the hired hands,
and followed.
21 Then they entered Capernaum.
When the Sabbath arrived, Jesus lost no
me in ge ng to the mee ng place. He
spent the day there teaching.
22 They were surprised at his teaching--
so forthright, so conﬁdent--not quibbling
and quo ng like the religion scholars.
23 Suddenly, while s ll in the mee ng
place, he was interrupted by a man who
was deeply disturbed and yelling out,
24 "What business do you have here
with us, Jesus? Nazarene! I know what
you're up to! You're the Holy One of
God, and you've come to destroy us!"MARK 1
5
25 Jesus shut him up: "Quiet! Get out of
him!"
26 The aﬄic ng spirit threw the man
into spasms, protes ng loudly--and got
out.
27 Everyone there was incredulous,
buzzing with curiosity. "What's going on
here? A new teaching that does what
it says? He shuts up deﬁling, demonic
spirits and sends them packing!"
28 News of this traveled fast and was
soon all over Galilee.
29 Directly on leaving the mee ng
place, they came to Simon and Andrew's
house, accompanied by James and John.
30 Simon's mother-in-law was sick in
bed, burning up with fever. They told
Jesus.
31 He went to her, took her hand, and
raised her up. No sooner had the fever
le than she was up ﬁxing dinner for
them.MARK 1
32 That evening, a
6
er the sun
was down, they brought sick and
evil-aﬄicted people to him,
33 the whole city lined up at his door!
34 He cured their sick bodies and
tormented spirits. Because the demons
knew his true iden ty, he didn't let them
say a word.
35 While it was s ll night, way before
dawn, he got up and went out to a
secluded spot and prayed.
36 Simon and those with him went
looking for him.
37 They found him and said,
"Everybody's looking for you."
38 Jesus said, "Let's go to the rest of the
villages so I can preach there also. This is
why I've come."
39 He went to their mee ng places all
through Galilee, preaching and throwing
out the demons.MARK 1
7
40 A leper came to him, begging on his
knees, "If you want to, you can cleanse
me."
41 Deeply moved, Jesus put out his
hand, touched him, and said, "I want to.
Be clean."
42 Then and there the leprosy was gone,
his skin smooth and healthy.
43 Jesus dismissed him with strict
orders:
44 "Say nothing to anyone. Take the
oﬀering for cleansing that Moses
prescribed and present yourself to the
priest. This will validate your healing to
the people."
45 But as soon as the man was out
of earshot, he told everyone he met
what had happened, spreading the
news all over town. So Jesus kept to
out-of-the-way places, no longer able to
move freely in and out of the city. ButMARK 2
8
people found him, and came from all
over.
1 A er a few days, Jesus returned to
Capernaum, and word got around
that he was back home.
2 A crowd gathered, jamming the
entrance so no one could get in or out.
He was teaching the Word.
3 They brought a paraplegic to him,
carried by four men.
4 When they weren't able to get in
because of the crowd, they removed part
of the roof and lowered the paraplegic
on his stretcher.
5 Impressed by their bold belief, Jesus
said to the paraplegic, "Son, I forgive
your sins."
6 Some religion scholars si ng there
started whispering among themselves,
7 "He can't talk that way! That's
blasphemy! God and only God can
forgive sins."
2MARK 2
9
8 Jesus knew right away what they were
thinking, and said, "Why are you so
skep cal?
9 Which is simpler: to say to the
paraplegic, 'I forgive your sins,' or say,
'Get up, take your stretcher, and start
walking'?
10 Well, just so it's clear that I'm the
Son of Man and authorized to do
either, or both..."(he looked now at the
paraplegic),
11 "Get up. Pick up your stretcher and
go home."
12 And the man did it--got up, grabbed
his stretcher, and walked out, with
everyone there watching him. They
rubbed their eyes, incredulous--and
then praised God, saying, "We've never
seen anything like this!"
13 Then Jesus went again to walk
alongside the lake. Again a crowd came
to him, and he taught them.MARK 2
10
14 Strolling along, he saw Levi, son of
Alphaeus, at his work collec ng taxes.
Jesus said, "Come along with me." He
came.
15 Later Jesus and his disciples were at
home having supper with a collec on of
disreputable guests. Unlikely as it seems,
more than a few of them had become
followers.
16 The religion scholars and Pharisees
saw him keeping this kind of company
and lit into his disciples: "What kind of
example is this, ac ng cozy with the
riﬀ-raﬀ?"
17 Jesus, overhearing, shot back, "Who
needs a doctor: the healthy or the sick?
I'm here invi ng the sin-sick, not the
spiritually-ﬁt."
18 The disciples of John and the disciples
of the Pharisees made a prac ce of
fas ng. Some people confronted Jesus:
"Why do the followers of John andMARK 2
11
the Pharisees take on the discipline of
fas ng, but your followers don't?"
19 Jesus said, "When you're celebra ng
a wedding, you don't skimp on the cake
and wine. You feast. Later you may need
to pull in your belt, but not now. As long
as the bride and groom are with you,
you have a good me. No one throws
cold water on a friendly bonﬁre. This is
Kingdom Come!"
21 He went on, "No one cuts up a ﬁne
silk scarf to patch old work clothes; you
want fabrics that match.
22 And you don't put your wine in
cracked bo les."
23 One Sabbath day he was walking
through a ﬁeld of ripe grain.
24 As his disciples made a path, they
pulled oﬀ heads of grain. The Pharisees
told on them to Jesus: "Look, your
disciples are breaking Sabbath rules!"MARK 2 – 3
12
25 Jesus said, "Really? Haven't you
ever read what David did when he was
hungry, along with those who were with
him?
26 How he entered the sanctuary
and ate fresh bread oﬀ the altar, with
the Chief Priest Abiathar right there
watching--holy bread that no one but
priests were allowed to eat--and handed
it out to his companions?"
27 Then Jesus said, "The Sabbath was
made to serve us; we weren't made to
serve the Sabbath.
28 The Son of Man is no lackey to the
Sabbath. He's in charge!"
1 Then he went back in the mee ng
place where he found a man with a
crippled hand.
2 The Pharisees had their eyes on Jesus
to see if he would heal him, hoping to
catch him in a Sabbath infrac on.
3MARK 3
13
3 He said to the man with the crippled
hand, "Stand here where we can see
you."
4 Then he spoke to the people: "What
kind of ac on suits the Sabbath best?
Doing good or doing evil? Helping people
or leaving them helpless?" No one said a
word.
5 He looked them in the eye, one a er
another, angry now, furious at their
hard-nosed religion. He said to the man,
"Hold out your hand." He held it out--it
was as good as new!
6 The Pharisees got out as fast as they
could, spu ering about how they would
join forces with Herod's followers and
ruin him.
7 Jesus went oﬀ with his disciples to the
sea to get away. But a huge crowd from
Galilee trailed a er them--
8 also from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea,
across the Jordan, and around Tyre andMARK 3
14
Sidon--swarms of people who had heard
the reports and had come to see for
themselves.
9 He told his disciples to get a boat
ready so he wouldn't be trampled by the
crowd.
10 He had healed many people, and
now everyone who had something
wrong was pushing and shoving to get
near and touch him.
11 Evil spirits, when they recognized
him, fell down and cried out, "You are
the Son of God!"
12 But Jesus would have none of it.
He shut them up, forbidding them to
iden fy him in public.
13 He climbed a mountain and invited
those he wanted with him. They climbed
together.
14 He se led on twelve, and designated
them apostles. The plan was that theyMARK 3
15
would be with him, and he would send
them out to proclaim the Word
15 and give them authority to banish
demons.
16 These are the Twelve: Simon (Jesus
later named him Peter, meaning "Rock"),
17 James, son of Zebedee, John, brother
of James (Jesus nicknamed the Zebedee
brothers Boanerges, meaning "Sons of
Thunder"),
18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Ma hew, Thomas, James, son of
Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the
Canaanite,
19 Judas Iscariot (who betrayed him).
20 Jesus came home and, as usual,
a crowd gathered--so many making
demands on him that there wasn't even
me to eat.
21 His friends heard what was going
on and went to rescue him, by forceMARK 3
16
if necessary. They suspected he was
ge ng carried away with himself.
22 The religion scholars from Jerusalem
came down spreading rumors that he
was working black magic, using devil
tricks to impress them with spiritual
power.
23 Jesus confronted their slander with
a story: "Does it make sense to send a
devil to catch a devil, to use Satan to get
rid of Satan?
24 A constantly squabbling family
disintegrates. If Satan were ﬁgh ng
Satan, there soon wouldn't be any Satan
le .
27 Do you think it's possible in broad
daylight to enter the house of an awake,
able-bodied man, and walk oﬀ with his
possessions unless you e him up ﬁrst?
Tie him up, though, and you can clean
him out.MARK 3
17
28 "Listen to this carefully. I'm warning
you. There's nothing done or said that
can't be forgiven.
29 But if you persist in your slanders
against God's Holy Spirit, you are
repudia ng the very One who forgives,
sawing oﬀ the branch on which you're
si ng, severing by your own perversity
all connec on with the One who
forgives."
30 He gave this warning because they
were accusing him of being in league
with Evil.
31 Just then his mother and brothers
showed up. Standing outside, they
relayed a message that they wanted a
word with him.
32 He was surrounded by the crowd
when he was given the message, "Your
mother and brothers and sisters are
outside looking for you."MARK 3 – 4
18
33 Jesus responded, "Who do you think
are my mother and brothers?"
34 Looking around, taking in everyone
seated around him, he said, "Right here,
right in front of you--my mother and my
brothers.
35 Obedience is thicker than blood.
The person who obeys God's will is my
brother and sister and mother."
1 He went back to teaching by the
sea. A crowd built up to such a great
size that he had to get into an oﬀshore
boat, using the boat as a pulpit as the
people pushed to the water's edge.
2 He taught by using stories, many
stories.
3 "Listen. What do you make of this? A
farmer planted seed.
4 As he sca ered the seed, some of it
fell on the road and birds ate it.
5 Some fell in the gravel; it sprouted
quickly but didn't put down roots,
4MARK 4
19
6 so when the sun came up it withered
just as quickly.
7 Some fell in the weeds; as it came up,
it was strangled among the weeds and
nothing came of it.
8 Some fell on good earth and came
up with a ﬂourish, producing a harvest
exceeding his wildest dreams.
9 "Are you listening to this? Really
listening?"
10 When they were oﬀ by themselves,
those who were close to him, along with
the Twelve, asked about the stories.
11 He told them, "You've been given
insight into God's kingdom--you know
how it works. But to those who can't
see it yet, everything comes in stories,
crea ng readiness, nudging them toward
recep ve insight.
12 These are people--Whose eyes are
open but don't see a thing, Whose ears
are open but don't understand a word,MARK 4
20
Who avoid making an about-face and
ge ng forgiven."
13 He con nued, "Do you see how this
story works? All my stories work this
way.
14 "The farmer plants the Word.
15 Some people are like the seed that
falls on the hardened soil of the road.
No sooner do they hear the Word than
Satan snatches away what has been
planted in them.
16 "And some are like the seed that
lands in the gravel. When they ﬁrst
hear the Word, they respond with great
enthusiasm.
17 But there is such shallow soil of
character that when the emo ons wear
oﬀ and some diﬃculty arrives, there is
nothing to show for it.
18 "The seed cast in the weeds
represents the ones who hear the
kingdom newsMARK 4
21
19 but are overwhelmed with worries
about all the things they have to do and
all the things they want to get. The stress
strangles what they heard, and nothing
comes of it.
20 "But the seed planted in the good
earth represents those who hear the
Word, embrace it, and produce a harvest
beyond their wildest dreams."
21 Jesus went on: "Does anyone bring a
lamp home and put it under a washtub
or beneath the bed? Don't you put it up
on a table or on the mantel?
22 We're not keeping secrets, we're
telling them; we're not hiding things,
we're bringing them out into the open.
23 "Are you listening to this? Really
listening?
24 "Listen carefully to what I am
saying--and be wary of the shrewd
advice that tells you how to get aheadMARK 4
22
in the world on your own. Giving, not
ge ng, is the way.
25 Generosity begets generosity.
S nginess impoverishes."
26 Then Jesus said, "God's kingdom is
like seed thrown on a ﬁeld by a man
27 who then goes to bed and forgets
about it. The seed sprouts and grows--he
has no idea how it happens.
28 The earth does it all without his help:
ﬁrst a green stem of grass, then a bud,
then the ripened grain.
29 When the grain is fully formed, he
reaps--harvest me!
30 "How can we picture God's kingdom?
What kind of story can we use?
31 It's like a pine nut. When it lands on
the ground it is quite small as seeds go,
32 yet once it is planted it grows into
a huge pine tree with thick branches.
Eagles nest in it."MARK 4
23
33 With many stories like these, he
presented his message to them, ﬁ ng
the stories to their experience and
maturity.
34 He was never without a story when
he spoke. When he was alone with
his disciples, he went over everything,
sor ng out the tangles, untying the
knots.
35 Late that day he said to them, "Let's
go across to the other side."
36 They took him in the boat as he was.
Other boats came along.
37 A huge storm came up. Waves
poured into the boat, threatening to sink
it.
38 And Jesus was in the stern, head
on a pillow, sleeping! They roused him,
saying, "Teacher, is it nothing to you that
we're going down?"
39 Awake now, he told the wind to pipe
down and said to the sea, "Quiet! Se leMARK 4 – 5
24
down!" The wind ran out of breath; the
sea became smooth as glass.
40 Jesus reprimanded the disciples:
"Why are you such cowards? Don't you
have any faith at all?"
41 They were in absolute awe,
staggered. "Who is this, anyway?" they
asked. "Wind and sea at his beck and
call!"
1 They arrived on the other side
of the sea in the country of the
Gerasenes.
2 As Jesus got out of the boat, a
madman from the cemetery came up to
him.
3 He lived there among the tombs and
graves. No one could restrain him--he
couldn't be chained, couldn't be ed
down.
4 He had been ed up many mes
with chains and ropes, but he broke the
5MARK 5
25
chains, snapped the ropes. No one was
strong enough to tame him.
5 Night and day he roamed through the
graves and the hills, screaming out and
slashing himself with sharp stones.
6 When he saw Jesus a long way oﬀ, he
ran and bowed in worship before him--
7 then bellowed in protest, "What
business do you have, Jesus, Son of the
High God, messing with me? I swear to
God, don't give me a hard me!"
8 (Jesus had just commanded the
tormen ng evil spirit, "Out! Get out of
the man!")
9 Jesus asked him, "Tell me your name."
He replied, "My name is Mob. I'm a
rio ng mob."
10 Then he desperately begged Jesus
not to banish them from the country.
11 A large herd of pigs was browsing
and roo ng on a nearby hill.MARK 5
26
12 The demons begged him, "Send us to
the pigs so we can live in them."
13 Jesus gave the order. But it was even
worse for the pigs than for the man.
Crazed, they stampeded over a cliﬀ into
the sea and drowned.
14 Those tending the pigs, scared to
death, bolted and told their story in
town and country. Everyone wanted to
see what had happened.
15 They came up to Jesus and saw the
madman si ng there wearing decent
clothes and making sense, no longer a
walking madhouse of a man.
16 Those who had seen it told the
others what had happened to the
demon-possessed man and the pigs.
17 At ﬁrst they were in awe--and
then they were upset, upset over the
drowned pigs. They demanded that
Jesus leave and not come back.MARK 5
18 As Jesus was ge
27
ng into the boat,
the demon-delivered man begged to go
along,
19 but he wouldn't let him. Jesus said,
"Go home to your own people. Tell them
your story--what the Master did, how he
had mercy on you."
20 The man went back and began to
preach in the Ten Towns area about what
Jesus had done for him. He was the talk
of the town.
21 A er Jesus crossed over by boat, a
large crowd met him at the seaside.
22 One of the mee ng-place leaders
named Jairus came. When he saw Jesus,
he fell to his knees,
23 beside himself as he begged, "My
dear daughter is at death's door. Come
and lay hands on her so she will get well
and live."MARK 5
28
24 Jesus went with him, the whole
crowd tagging along, pushing and
jostling him.
25 A woman who had suﬀered a
condi on of hemorrhaging for twelve
years--
26 a long succession of physicians had
treated her, and treated her badly, taking
all her money and leaving her worse oﬀ
than before--
27 had heard about Jesus. She slipped in
from behind and touched his robe.
28 She was thinking to herself, "If I can
put a ﬁnger on his robe, I can get well."
29 The moment she did it, the ﬂow
of blood dried up. She could feel the
change and knew her plague was over
and done with.
30 At the same moment, Jesus felt
energy discharging from him. He turned
around to the crowd and asked, "Who
touched my robe?"MARK 5
29
31 His disciples said, "What are you
talking about? With this crowd pushing
and jostling you, you're asking, 'Who
touched me?' Dozens have touched
you!"
32 But he went on asking, looking
around to see who had done it.
33 The woman, knowing what had
happened, knowing she was the one,
stepped up in fear and trembling, knelt
before him, and gave him the whole
story.
34 Jesus said to her, "Daughter, you took
a risk of faith, and now you're healed
and whole. Live well, live blessed! Be
healed of your plague."
35 While he was s ll talking, some
people came from the leader's house
and told him, "Your daughter is dead.
Why bother the Teacher any more?"MARK 5
30
36 Jesus overheard what they were
talking about and said to the leader,
"Don't listen to them; just trust me."
37 He permi ed no one to go in with
him except Peter, James, and John.
38 They entered the leader's house
and pushed their way through the
gossips looking for a story and neighbors
bringing in casseroles.
39 Jesus was abrupt: "Why all this
busybody grief and gossip? This child
isn't dead; she's sleeping."
40 Provoked to sarcasm, they told him
he didn't know what he was talking
about. But when he had sent them
all out, he took the child's father and
mother, along with his companions, and
entered the child's room.
41 He clasped the girl's hand and said,
"Talitha koum," which means, "Li le girl,
get up."MARK 5 – 6
31
42 At that, she was up and walking
around! This girl was twelve years of
age. They, of course, were all beside
themselves with joy.
43 He gave them strict orders that no
one was to know what had taken place
in that room. Then he said, "Give her
something to eat."
1 He le there and returned to his
hometown. His disciples came along.
2 On the Sabbath, he gave a lecture in
the mee ng place. He made a real hit,
impressing everyone. "We had no idea
he was this good!" they said. "How did
he get so wise all of a sudden, get such
ability?"
3 But in the next breath they were
cu ng him down: "He's just a carpenter-
-Mary's boy. We've known him since he
was a kid. We know his brothers, James,
Justus, Jude, and Simon, and his sisters.
Who does he think he is?" They tripped
6MARK 6
32
over what li le they knew about him
and fell, sprawling. And they never got
any further.
4 Jesus told them, "A prophet has li le
honor in his hometown, among his
rela ves, on the streets he played in as a
child."
5 Jesus wasn't able to do much of
anything there--he laid hands on a few
sick people and healed them, that's all.
6 He couldn't get over their
stubbornness. He le and made a
circuit of the other villages, teaching.
7 Jesus called the Twelve to him, and
sent them out in pairs. He gave them
authority and power to deal with the evil
opposi on.
8 He sent them oﬀ with these
instruc ons: "Don't think you need a lot
of extra equipment for this. You are the
equipment. No special appeals for funds.
Keep it simple.MARK 6
33
10 "And no luxury inns. Get a modest
place and be content there un l you
leave.
11 "If you're not welcomed, not listened
to, quietly withdraw. Don't make a
scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on
your way."
12 Then they were on the road. They
preached with joyful urgency that life
can be radically diﬀerent;
13 right and le they sent the demons
packing; they brought wellness to the
sick, anoin ng their bodies, healing their
spirits.
14 King Herod heard of all this, for by
this me the name of Jesus was on
everyone's lips. He said, "This has to
be John the Bap zer come back from
the dead--that's why he's able to work
miracles!"MARK 6
34
15 Others said, "No, it's Elijah." Others
said, "He's a prophet, just like one of the
old- me prophets."
16 But Herod wouldn't budge: "It's John,
sure enough. I cut oﬀ his head, and now
he's back, alive."
17 Herod was the one who had ordered
the arrest of John, put him in chains,
and sent him to prison at the nagging of
Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
18 For John had provoked Herod by
naming his rela onship with Herodias
"adultery."
19 Herodias, smoldering with hate,
wanted to kill him, but didn't dare
20 because Herod was in awe of John.
Convinced that he was a holy man, he
gave him special treatment. Whenever
he listened to him he was miserable
with guilt--and yet he couldn't stay away.
Something in John kept pulling him back.MARK 6
35
21 But a portentous day arrived when
Herod threw a birthday party, invi ng all
the brass and bluebloods in Galilee.
22 Herodias's daughter entered the
banquet hall and danced for the guests.
She dazzled Herod and the guests. The
king said to the girl, "Ask me anything.
I'll give you anything you want."
23 Carried away, he kept on, "I swear, I'll
split my kingdom with you if you say so!"
24 She went back to her mother and
said, "What should I ask for?" "Ask for
the head of John the Bap zer."
25 Excited, she ran back to the king
and said, "I want the head of John the
Bap zer served up on a pla er. And I
want it now!"
26 That sobered the king up fast. But
unwilling to lose face with his guests, he
caved in and let her have her wish.
27 The king sent the execu oner oﬀ
to the prison with orders to bring backMARK 6
36
John's head. He went, cut oﬀ John's
head,
28 brought it back on a pla er, and
presented it to the girl, who gave it to
her mother.
29 When John's disciples heard about
this, they came and got the body and
gave it a decent burial.
30 The apostles then rendezvoused with
Jesus and reported on all that they had
done and taught.
31 Jesus said, "Come oﬀ by yourselves;
let's take a break and get a li le rest."
For there was constant coming and
going. They didn't even have me to eat.
32 So they got in the boat and went oﬀ
to a remote place by themselves.
33 Someone saw them going and the
word got around. From the surrounding
towns people went out on foot, running,
and got there ahead of them.MARK 6
37
34 When Jesus arrived, he saw this huge
crowd. At the sight of them, his heart
broke--like sheep with no shepherd they
were. He went right to work teaching
them.
35 When his disciples thought this had
gone on long enough--it was now quite
late in the day--they interrupted: "We
are a long way out in the country, and
it's very late.
36 Pronounce a benedic on and send
these folks oﬀ so they can get some
supper."
37 Jesus said, "You do it. Fix supper for
them." They replied, "Are you serious?
You want us to go spend a fortune on
food for their supper?"
38 But he was quite serious. "How many
loaves of bread do you have? Take an
inventory." That didn't take long. "Five,"
they said, "plus two ﬁsh."MARK 6
38
39 Jesus got them all to sit down in
groups of ﬁ y or a hundred--they looked
like a patchwork quilt of wildﬂowers
spread out on the green grass!
41 He took the ﬁve loaves and two
ﬁsh, li ed his face to heaven in prayer,
blessed, broke, and gave the bread to
the disciples, and the disciples in turn
gave it to the people. He did the same
with the ﬁsh.
42 They all ate their ﬁll.
43 The disciples gathered twelve baskets
of le overs.
44 More than ﬁve thousand were at the
supper.
45 As soon as the meal was ﬁnished,
Jesus insisted that the disciples get
in the boat and go on ahead across
to Bethsaida while he dismissed the
congrega on.
46 A er sending them oﬀ, he climbed a
mountain to pray.MARK 6
39
47 Late at night, the boat was far out at
sea; Jesus was s ll by himself on land.
48 He could see his men struggling
with the oars, the wind having come up
against them. At about four o'clock in
the morning, Jesus came toward them,
walking on the sea. He intended to go
right by them.
49 But when they saw him walking on
the sea, they thought it was a ghost and
screamed, scared out of their wits.
50 Jesus was quick to comfort them:
"Courage! It's me. Don't be afraid."
51 As soon as he climbed into the boat,
the wind died down. They were stunned,
shaking their heads, wondering what
was going on.
52 They didn't understand what he had
done at the supper. None of this had yet
penetrated their hearts.
53 They beached the boat at Gennesaret
and ed up at the landing.MARK 6 – 7
40
54 As soon as they got out of the boat,
word got around fast.
55 People ran this way and that, bringing
their sick on stretchers to where they
heard he was.
56 Wherever he went, village or town
or country crossroads, they brought
their sick to the marketplace and begged
him to let them touch the edge of his
coat--that's all. And whoever touched
him became well.
1 The Pharisees, along with some
religion scholars who had come from
Jerusalem, gathered around him.
2 They no ced that some of his
disciples weren't being careful with
ritual washings before meals.
3 The Pharisees--Jews in general, in
fact--would never eat a meal without
going through the mo ons of a ritual
hand-washing,
7MARK 7
41
4 with an especially vigorous scrubbing
if they had just come from the market
(to say nothing of the scourings they'd
give jugs and pots and pans).
5 The Pharisees and religion scholars
asked, "Why do your disciples ﬂout the
rules, showing up at meals without
washing their hands?"
6 Jesus answered, "Isaiah was right
about frauds like you, hit the bull's-eye
in fact: These people make a big show
of saying the right thing, but their heart
isn't in it.
7 They act like they are worshiping me,
but they don't mean it. They just use me
as a cover for teaching whatever suits
their fancy,
8 Ditching God's command and taking
up the latest fads."
9 He went on, "Well, good for you.
You get rid of God's command so youMARK 7
42
won't be inconvenienced in following
the religious fashions!
10 Moses said, 'Respect your father
and mother,' and, 'Anyone denouncing
father or mother should be killed.'
11 But you weasel out of that by saying
that it's perfectly acceptable to say to
father or mother, 'Gi ! What I owed you
I've given as a gi to God,'
12 thus relieving yourselves of obliga on
to father or mother.
13 You scratch out God's Word and
scrawl a whim in its place. You do a lot of
things like this."
14 Jesus called the crowd together again
and said, "Listen now, all of you--take
this to heart.
15 It's not what you swallow that
pollutes your life; it's what you
vomit--that's the real pollu on."MARK 7
17 When he was back home a
43
er being
with the crowd, his disciples said, "We
don't get it. Put it in plain language."
18 Jesus said, "Are you being willfully
stupid? Don't you see that what you
swallow can't contaminate you?
19 It doesn't enter your heart but your
stomach, works its way through the
intes nes, and is ﬁnally ﬂushed." (That
took care of dietary quibbling; Jesus was
saying that all foods are ﬁt to eat.)
20 He went on: "It's what comes out of
a person that pollutes:
21 obsceni es, lusts, the s, murders,
adulteries,
22 greed, depravity, decep ve dealings,
carousing, mean looks, slander,
arrogance, foolishness--
23 all these are vomit from the heart.
There is the source of your pollu on."
24 From there Jesus set out for the
vicinity of Tyre. He entered a houseMARK 7
44
there where he didn't think he would be
found, but he couldn't escape no ce.
25 He was barely inside when a woman
who had a disturbed daughter heard
where he was. She came and knelt at his
feet,
26 begging for help. The woman was
Greek, Syro-Phoenician by birth. She
asked him to cure her daughter.
27 He said, "Stand in line and take your
turn. The children get fed ﬁrst. If there's
any le over, the dogs get it."
28 She said, "Of course, Master. But
don't dogs under the table get scraps
dropped by the children?"
29 Jesus was impressed. "You're right!
On your way! Your daughter is no longer
disturbed. The demonic aﬄic on is
gone."
30 She went home and found her
daughter relaxed on the bed, the
torment gone for good.MARK 7
31 Then he le
45
the region of Tyre, went
through Sidon back to Galilee Lake and
over to the district of the Ten Towns.
32 Some people brought a man who
could neither hear nor speak and asked
Jesus to lay a healing hand on him.
33 He took the man oﬀ by himself, put
his ﬁngers in the man's ears and some
spit on the man's tongue.
34 Then Jesus looked up in prayer,
groaned migh ly, and commanded,
"Ephphatha!--Open up!"
35 And it happened. The man's hearing
was clear and his speech plain--just like
that.
36 Jesus urged them to keep it quiet,
but they talked it up all the more,
37 beside themselves with excitement.
"He's done it all and done it well. He
gives hearing to the deaf, speech to the
speechless."MARK 8
1 At about this same
46
me he again
found himself with a hungry crowd
on his hands. He called his disciples
together and said,
2 "This crowd is breaking my heart.
They have stuck with me for three days,
and now they have nothing to eat.
3 If I send them home hungry, they'll
faint along the way--some of them have
come a long distance."
4 His disciples responded, "What do you
expect us to do about it? Buy food out
here in the desert?"
5 He asked, "How much bread do you
have?" "Seven loaves," they said.
6 So Jesus told the crowd to sit down on
the ground. A er giving thanks, he took
the seven bread loaves, broke them into
pieces, and gave them to his disciples so
they could hand them out to the crowd.
7 They also had a few ﬁsh. He
pronounced a blessing over the ﬁsh and
8MARK 8
47
told his disciples to hand them out as
well.
8 The crowd ate its ﬁll. Seven sacks of
le overs were collected.
9 There were well over four thousand at
the meal. Then he sent them home.
10 He himself went straight to the
boat with his disciples and set out for
Dalmanoutha.
11 When they arrived, the Pharisees
came out and started in on him,
badgering him to prove himself, pushing
him up against the wall.
12 Provoked, he said, "Why does this
genera on clamor for miraculous
guarantees? If I have anything to say
about it, you'll not get so much as a hint
of a guarantee."
13 He then le them, got back in the
boat, and headed for the other side.MARK 8
48
14 But the disciples forgot to pack a
lunch. Except for a single loaf of bread,
there wasn't a crumb in the boat.
15 Jesus warned, "Be very careful. Keep
a sharp eye out for the contamina ng
yeast of Pharisees and the followers of
Herod."
16 Meanwhile, the disciples were
ﬁnding fault with each other because
they had forgo en to bring bread.
17 Jesus overheard and said, "Why are
you fussing because you forgot bread?
Don't you see the point of all this? Don't
you get it at all?
19 Remember the ﬁve loaves I broke for
the ﬁve thousand? How many baskets
of le overs did you pick up?" They said,
"Twelve."
20 "And the seven loaves for the
four thousand--how many bags full of
le overs did you get?" "Seven."
21 He said, "Do you s ll not get it?"MARK 8
49
22 They arrived at Bethsaida. Some
people brought a sightless man and
begged Jesus to give him a healing
touch.
23 Taking him by the hand, he led him
out of the village. He put spit in the
man's eyes, laid hands on him, and
asked, "Do you see anything?"
24 He looked up. "I see men. They look
like walking trees."
25 So Jesus laid hands on his eyes again.
The man looked hard and realized that
he had recovered perfect sight, saw
everything in bright, twenty-twenty
focus.
26 Jesus sent him straight home, telling
him, "Don't enter the village."
27 Jesus and his disciples headed out
for the villages around Caesarea Philippi.
As they walked, he asked, "Who do the
people say I am?"MARK 8
28 "Some say 'John the Bap
50
zer,'" they
said. "Others say 'Elijah.' S ll others say
'one of the prophets.'"
29 He then asked, "And you--what are
you saying about me? Who am I?" Peter
gave the answer: "You are the Christ, the
Messiah."
30 Jesus warned them to keep it quiet,
not to breathe a word of it to anyone.
31 He then began explaining things to
them: "It is necessary that the Son of
Man proceed to an ordeal of suﬀering,
be tried and found guilty by the elders,
high priests, and religion scholars, be
killed, and a er three days rise up alive."
32 He said this simply and clearly so
they couldn't miss it. But Peter grabbed
him in protest.
33 Turning and seeing his disciples
wavering, wondering what to believe,
Jesus confronted Peter. "Peter, get outMARK 8
51
of my way! Satan, get lost! You have no
idea how God works."
34 Calling the crowd to join his disciples,
he said, "Anyone who intends to come
with me has to let me lead. You're not in
the driver's seat; I am. Don't run from
suﬀering; embrace it. Follow me and I'll
show you how.
35 Self-help is no help at all. Self-
sacriﬁce is the way, my way, to saving
yourself, your true self.
36 What good would it do to get
everything you want and lose you, the
real you?
37 What could you ever trade your soul
for?
38 "If any of you are embarrassed
over me and the way I'm leading you
when you get around your ﬁckle and
unfocused friends, know that you'll be
an even greater embarrassment to the
Son of Man when he arrives in all theMARK 9
52
splendor of God, his Father, with an
army of the holy angels."
1 Then he drove it home by saying,
"This isn't pie in the sky by and by.
Some of you who are standing here are
going to see it happen, see the kingdom
of God arrive in full force."
2 Six days later, three of them did see
it. Jesus took Peter, James, and John
and led them up a high mountain. His
appearance changed from the inside
out, right before their eyes.
3 His clothes shimmered, glistening
white, whiter than any bleach could
make them.
4 Elijah, along with Moses, came into
view, in deep conversa on with Jesus.
5 Peter interrupted, "Rabbi, this is
a great moment! Let's build three
memorials--one for you, one for Moses,
one for Elijah."
9MARK 9
53
6 He blurted this out without thinking,
stunned as they all were by what they
were seeing.
7 Just then a light-radiant cloud
enveloped them, and from deep in the
cloud, a voice: "This is my Son, marked
by my love. Listen to him."
8 The next minute the disciples were
looking around, rubbing their eyes,
seeing nothing but Jesus, only Jesus.
9 Coming down the mountain, Jesus
swore them to secrecy. "Don't tell a soul
what you saw. A er the Son of Man rises
from the dead, you're free to talk."
10 They puzzled over that, wondering
what on earth "rising from the dead"
meant.
11 Meanwhile they were asking, "Why
do the religion scholars say that Elijah
has to come ﬁrst?"
12 Jesus replied, "Elijah does come ﬁrst
and get everything ready for the comingMARK 9
54
of the Son of Man. They treated this
Elijah like dirt, much like they will treat
the Son of Man, who will, according to
Scripture, suﬀer terribly and be kicked
around contemp bly."
14 When they came back down the
mountain to the other disciples, they
saw a huge crowd around them, and the
religion scholars cross-examining them.
15 As soon as the people in the crowd
saw Jesus, admiring excitement s rred
them. They ran and greeted him.
16 He asked, "What's going on? What's
all the commo on?"
17 A man out of the crowd answered,
"Teacher, I brought my mute son, made
speechless by a demon, to you.
18 Whenever it seizes him, it throws him
to the ground. He foams at the mouth,
grinds his teeth, and goes s ﬀ as a
board. I told your disciples, hoping they
could deliver him, but they couldn't."MARK 9
19 Jesus said, "What a genera
55
on! No
sense of God! How many mes do I
have to go over these things? How much
longer do I have to put up with this?
Bring the boy here."
20 They brought him. When the demon
saw Jesus, it threw the boy into a seizure,
causing him to writhe on the ground and
foam at the mouth.
21 He asked the boy's father, "How long
has this been going on?" "Ever since he
was a li le boy.
22 Many mes it pitches him into ﬁre or
the river to do away with him. If you can
do anything, do it. Have a heart and help
us!"
23 Jesus said, "If? There are no 'ifs'
among believers. Anything can happen."
24 No sooner were the words out of
his mouth than the father cried, "Then I
believe. Help me with my doubts!"MARK 9
56
25 Seeing that the crowd was forming
fast, Jesus gave the vile spirit its
marching orders: "Dumb and deaf spirit,
I command you--Out of him, and stay
out!"
26 Screaming, and with much thrashing
about, it le . The boy was pale as a
corpse, so people started saying, "He's
dead."
27 But Jesus, taking his hand, raised
him. The boy stood up.
28 A er arriving back home, his disciples
cornered Jesus and asked, "Why couldn't
we throw the demon out?"
29 He answered, "There is no way to
get rid of this kind of demon except by
prayer."
30 Leaving there, they went through
Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know
their whereabouts,
31 for he wanted to teach his disciples.
He told them, "The Son of Man is aboutMARK 9
57
to be betrayed to some people who
want nothing to do with God. They will
murder him. Three days a er his murder,
he will rise, alive."
32 They didn't know what he was talking
about, but were afraid to ask him about
it.
33 They came to Capernaum. When he
was safe at home, he asked them, "What
were you discussing on the road?"
34 The silence was deafening--they had
been arguing with one another over who
among them was greatest.
35 He sat down and summoned the
Twelve. "So you want ﬁrst place? Then
take the last place. Be the servant of all."
36 He put a child in the middle of the
room. Then, cradling the li le one in his
arms, he said,
37 "Whoever embraces one of these
children as I do embraces me, and far
more than me--God who sent me."MARK 9
58
38 John spoke up, "Teacher, we saw a
man using your name to expel demons
and we stopped him because he wasn't
in our group."
39 Jesus wasn't pleased. "Don't stop
him. No one can use my name to do
something good and powerful, and in
the next breath cut me down.
40 If he's not an enemy, he's an ally.
41 Why, anyone by just giving you a
cup of water in my name is on our side.
Count on it that God will no ce.
42 "On the other hand, if you give one
of these simple, childlike believers a
hard me, bullying or taking advantage
of their simple trust, you'll soon wish
you hadn't. You'd be be er oﬀ dropped
in the middle of the lake with a millstone
around your neck.
43 "If your hand or your foot gets in
God's way, chop it oﬀ and throw it away.
You're be er oﬀ maimed or lame andMARK 9 – 10
59
alive than the proud owner of two hands
and two feet, godless in a furnace of
eternal ﬁre.
47 And if your eye distracts you from
God, pull it out and throw it away.
48 You're be er oﬀ one-eyed and alive
than exercising your twenty-twenty
vision from inside the ﬁre of hell.
49 "Everyone's going through a reﬁning
ﬁre sooner or later,
50 but you'll be well-preserved,
protected from the eternal ﬂames. Be
preserva ves yourselves. Preserve the
peace."
1 From there he went to the area
of Judea across the Jordan. A
crowd of people, as was so o en the
case, went along, and he, as he so o en
did, taught them.
2 Pharisees came up, intending to give
him a hard me. They asked, "Is it legal
for a man to divorce his wife?"
10MARK 10
60
3 Jesus said, "What did Moses
command?"
4 They answered, "Moses gave
permission to ﬁll out a cer ﬁcate of
dismissal and divorce her."
5 Jesus said, "Moses wrote this
command only as a concession to your
hardhearted ways.
6 In the original crea on, God made
male and female to be together.
7 Because of this, a man leaves father
and mother, and in marriage
8 he becomes one ﬂesh with a woman--
no longer two individuals, but forming a
new unity.
9 Because God created this organic
union of the two sexes, no one should
desecrate his art by cu ng them apart."
10 When they were back home, the
disciples brought it up again.
11 Jesus gave it to them straight: "A man
who divorces his wife so he can marryMARK 10
61
someone else commits adultery against
her.
12 And a woman who divorces her
husband so she can marry someone else
commits adultery."
13 The people brought children to Jesus,
hoping he might touch them.
14 The disciples shooed them oﬀ. But
Jesus was irate and let them know it:
"Don't push these children away. Don't
ever get between them and me. These
children are at the very center of life in
the kingdom.
15 Mark this: Unless you accept God's
kingdom in the simplicity of a child,
you'll never get in."
16 Then, gathering the children up in his
arms, he laid his hands of blessing on
them.
17 As he went out into the street, a man
came running up, greeted him with greatMARK 10
62
reverence, and asked, "Good Teacher,
what must I do to get eternal life?"
18 Jesus said, "Why are you calling me
good? No one is good, only God.
19 You know the commandments: Don't
murder, don't commit adultery, don't
steal, don't lie, don't cheat, honor your
father and mother."
20 He said, "Teacher, I have--from my
youth--kept them all!"
21 Jesus looked him hard in the eye--and
loved him! He said, "There's one thing
le : Go sell whatever you own and give
it to the poor. All your wealth will then
be heavenly wealth. And come follow
me."
22 The man's face clouded over. This
was the last thing he expected to hear,
and he walked oﬀ with a heavy heart. He
was holding on ght to a lot of things,
and not about to let go.MARK 10
63
23 Looking at his disciples, Jesus said,
"Do you have any idea how diﬃcult it
is for people who 'have it all' to enter
God's kingdom?"
24 The disciples couldn't believe what
they were hearing, but Jesus kept on:
"You can't imagine how diﬃcult.
25 I'd say it's easier for a camel to go
through a needle's eye than for the rich
to get into God's kingdom."
26 That set the disciples back on their
heels. "Then who has any chance at all?"
they asked.
27 Jesus was blunt: "No chance at all if
you think you can pull it oﬀ by yourself.
Every chance in the world if you let God
do it."
28 Peter tried another angle: "We le
everything and followed you."
29 Jesus said, "Mark my words, no
one who sacriﬁces house, brothers,
sisters, mother, father, children, land-MARK 10
64
-whatever--because of me and the
Message
30 will lose out. They'll get it all back,
but mul plied many mes in homes,
brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and
land--but also in troubles. And then the
bonus of eternal life!
31 This is once again the Great Reversal:
Many who are ﬁrst will end up last, and
the last ﬁrst."
32 Back on the road, they set out for
Jerusalem. Jesus had a head start on
them, and they were following, puzzled
and not just a li le afraid. He took the
Twelve and began again to go over what
to expect next.
33 "Listen to me carefully. We're on
our way up to Jerusalem. When we get
there, the Son of Man will be betrayed
to the religious leaders and scholars.
They will sentence him to death. Then
they will hand him over to the Romans,MARK 10
65
34 who will mock and spit on him, give
him the third degree, and kill him. A er
three days he will rise alive."
35 James and John, Zebedee's sons,
came up to him. "Teacher, we have
something we want you to do for us."
36 "What is it? I'll see what I can do."
37 "Arrange it," they said, "so that we
will be awarded the highest places of
honor in your glory--one of us at your
right, the other at your le ."
38 Jesus said, "You have no idea
what you're asking. Are you capable
of drinking the cup I drink, of being
bap zed in the bap sm I'm about to be
plunged into?"
39 "Sure," they said. "Why not?" Jesus
said, "Come to think of it, you will drink
the cup I drink, and be bap zed in my
bap sm.MARK 10
66
40 But as to awarding places of honor,
that's not my business. There are other
arrangements for that."
41 When the other ten heard of this
conversa on, they lost their tempers
with James and John.
42 Jesus got them together to se le
things down. "You've observed how
godless rulers throw their weight
around," he said, "and when people get
a li le power how quickly it goes to their
heads.
43 It's not going to be that way with
you. Whoever wants to be great must
become a servant.
44 Whoever wants to be ﬁrst among
you must be your slave.
45 That is what the Son of Man has
done: He came to serve, not to be
served--and then to give away his life
in exchange for many who are held
hostage."MARK 10
46 They spent some
67
me in Jericho. As
Jesus was leaving town, trailed by his
disciples and a parade of people, a blind
beggar by the name of Bar maeus, son
of Timaeus, was si ng alongside the
road.
47 When he heard that Jesus the
Nazarene was passing by, he began to
cry out, "Son of David, Jesus! Mercy,
have mercy on me!"
48 Many tried to hush him up, but he
yelled all the louder, "Son of David!
Mercy, have mercy on me!"
49 Jesus stopped in his tracks. "Call him
over." They called him. "It's your lucky
day! Get up! He's calling you to come!"
50 Throwing oﬀ his coat, he was on his
feet at once and came to Jesus.
51 Jesus said, "What can I do for you?"
The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to
see."MARK 10 – 11
68
52 "On your way," said Jesus. "Your
faith has saved and healed you." In that
very instant he recovered his sight and
followed Jesus down the road.
1 When they were nearing
Jerusalem, at Bethphage and
Bethany on Mount Olives, he sent oﬀ
two of the disciples with instruc ons:
2 "Go to the village across from you.
As soon as you enter, you'll ﬁnd a colt
tethered, one that has never yet been
ridden. Un e it and bring it.
3 If anyone asks, 'What are you doing?'
say, 'The Master needs him, and will
return him right away.'"
4 They went and found a colt ed to a
door at the street corner and un ed it.
5 Some of those standing there said,
"What are you doing untying that colt?"
6 The disciples replied exactly as Jesus
had instructed them, and the people let
them alone.
11MARK 11
69
7 They brought the colt to Jesus, spread
their coats on it, and he mounted.
8 The people gave him a wonderful
welcome, some throwing their coats on
the street, others spreading out rushes
they had cut in the ﬁelds.
9 Running ahead and following a er,
they were calling out, Hosanna! Blessed
is he who comes in God's name!
10 Blessed the coming kingdom of
our father David! Hosanna in highest
heaven!
11 He entered Jerusalem, then entered
the Temple. He looked around, taking it
all in. But by now it was late, so he went
back to Bethany with the Twelve.
12 As they le Bethany the next day, he
was hungry.
13 Oﬀ in the distance he saw a ﬁg tree
in full leaf. He came up to it expec ng to
ﬁnd something for breakfast, but foundMARK 11
70
nothing but ﬁg leaves. (It wasn't yet the
season for ﬁgs.)
14 He addressed the tree: "No one is
going to eat fruit from you again--ever!"
And his disciples overheard him.
15 They arrived at Jerusalem.
Immediately on entering the Temple
Jesus started throwing out everyone
who had set up shop there, buying and
selling. He kicked over the tables of the
bankers and the stalls of the pigeon
merchants.
16 He didn't let anyone even carry a
basket through the Temple.
17 And then he taught them, quo ng
this text: My house was designated a
house of prayer for the na ons; You've
turned it into a hangout for thieves.
18 The high priests and religion scholars
heard what was going on and plo ed
how they might get rid of him. TheyMARK 11
71
panicked, for the en re crowd was
carried away by his teaching.
19 At evening, Jesus and his disciples
le the city.
20 In the morning, walking along the
road, they saw the ﬁg tree, shriveled to
a dry s ck.
21 Peter, remembering what had
happened the previous day, said to him,
"Rabbi, look--the ﬁg tree you cursed is
shriveled up!"
22 Jesus was ma er-of-fact: "Embrace
this God-life. Really embrace it,
23 and nothing will be too much for
you. This mountain, for instance: Just
say, 'Go jump in the lake'--no shuﬄing or
shilly-shallying--and it's as good as done.
24 That's why I urge you to pray for
absolutely everything, ranging from
small to large. Include everything as you
embrace this God-life, and you'll get
God's everything.MARK 11
72
25 And when you assume the posture of
prayer, remember that it's not all asking.
If you have anything against someone,
forgive--only then will your heavenly
Father be inclined to also wipe your slate
clean of sins."
27 Then when they were back in
Jerusalem once again, as they were
walking through the Temple, the high
priests, religion scholars, and leaders
came up
28 and demanded, "Show us your
creden als. Who authorized you to
speak and act like this?"
29 Jesus responded, "First let me ask
you a ques on. Answer my ques on and
then I'll present my creden als.
30 About the bap sm of John--who
authorized it: heaven or humans? Tell
me."
31 They were on the spot, and knew
it. They pulled back into a huddle andMARK 11 – 12
73
whispered, "If we say 'heaven,' he'll ask
us why we didn't believe John;
32 if we say 'humans,' we'll be up
against it with the people because they
all hold John up as a prophet."
33 They decided to concede that round
to Jesus. "We don't know," they said.
Jesus replied, "Then I won't answer your
ques on either."
1 Then Jesus started telling
them stories. "A man planted a
vineyard. He fenced it, dug a winepress,
erected a watchtower, turned it over to
the farmhands, and went oﬀ on a trip.
2 At the me for harvest, he sent a
servant back to the farmhands to collect
his proﬁts.
3 "They grabbed him, beat him up, and
sent him oﬀ empty-handed.
4 So he sent another servant. That one
they tarred and feathered.
12MARK 12
74
5 He sent another and that one they
killed. And on and on, many others.
Some they beat up, some they killed.
6 "Finally there was only one le : a
beloved son. In a last-ditch eﬀort, he
sent him, thinking, 'Surely they will
respect my son.'
7 "But those farmhands saw their
chance. They rubbed their hands
together in greed and said, 'This is the
heir! Let's kill him and have it all for
ourselves.'
8 They grabbed him, killed him, and
threw him over the fence.
9 "What do you think the owner of the
vineyard will do? Right. He'll come and
clean house. Then he'll assign the care
of the vineyard to others.
10 Read it for yourselves in Scripture:
That stone the masons threw out is now
the cornerstone!MARK 12
75
11 This is God's work; we rub our
eyes--we can hardly believe it!"
12 They wanted to lynch him then and
there but, in midated by public opinion,
held back. They knew the story was
about them. They got away from there
as fast as they could.
13 They sent some Pharisees and
followers of Herod to bait him,
hoping to catch him saying something
incrimina ng.
14 They came up and said, "Teacher,
we know you have integrity, that you
are indiﬀerent to public opinion, don't
pander to your students, and teach the
way of God accurately. Tell us: Is it lawful
to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
15 He knew it was a trick ques on, and
said, "Why are you playing these games
with me? Bring me a coin and let me
look at it."MARK 12
76
16 They handed him one. "This
engraving--who does it look like? And
whose name is on it?" "Caesar," they
said.
17 Jesus said, "Give Caesar what is his,
and give God what is his." Their mouths
hung open, speechless.
18 Some Sadducees, the party that
denies any possibility of resurrec on,
came up and asked,
19 "Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man
dies and leaves a wife but no child, his
brother is obligated to marry the widow
and have children.
20 Well, there once were seven
brothers. The ﬁrst took a wife. He died
childless.
21 The second married her. He died, and
s ll no child. The same with the third.
22 All seven took their turn, but no
child. Finally the wife died.MARK 12
77
23 When they are raised at the
resurrec on, whose wife is she? All
seven were her husband."
24 Jesus said, "You're way oﬀ base, and
here's why: One, you don't know your
Bibles; two, you don't know how God
works.
25 A er the dead are raised up, we're
past the marriage business. As it is
with angels now, all our ecstasies and
in macies then will be with God.
26 And regarding the dead, whether or
not they are raised, don't you ever read
the Bible? How God at the bush said
to Moses, 'I am--not was--the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob'?
27 The living God is God of the living,
not the dead. You're way, way oﬀ base."
28 One of the religion scholars came
up. Hearing the lively exchanges of
ques on and answer and seeing howMARK 12
78
sharp Jesus was in his answers, he put in
his ques on: "Which is most important
of all the commandments?"
29 Jesus said, "The ﬁrst in importance is,
'Listen, Israel: The Lord your God is one;
30 so love the Lord God with all your
passion and prayer and intelligence and
energy.'
31 And here is the second: 'Love others
as well as you love yourself.' There is no
other commandment that ranks with
these."
32 The religion scholar said, "A
wonderful answer, Teacher! So lucid and
accurate--that God is one and there is no
other.
33 And loving him with all passion and
intelligence and energy, and loving
others as well as you love yourself.
Why, that's be er than all oﬀerings and
sacriﬁces put together!"MARK 12
34 When Jesus realized how insigh
79
ul
he was, he said, "You're almost there,
right on the border of God's kingdom."
A er that, no one else dared ask a
ques on.
35 While he was teaching in the Temple,
Jesus asked, "How is it that the religion
scholars say that the Messiah is David's
'son,'
36 when we all know that David,
inspired by the Holy Spirit, said, God
said to my Master, "Sit here at my right
hand un l I put your enemies under your
feet."
37 "David here designates the Messiah
'my Master'--so how can the Messiah
also be his 'son'?" The large crowd was
delighted with what they heard.
38 He con nued teaching. "Watch out
for the religion scholars. They love
to walk around in academic gowns,MARK 12
80
preening in the radiance of public
ﬂa ery,
39 basking in prominent posi ons,
si ng at the head table at every church
func on.
40 And all the me they are exploi ng
the weak and helpless. The longer their
prayers, the worse they get. But they'll
pay for it in the end."
41 Si ng across from the oﬀering box,
he was observing how the crowd tossed
money in for the collec on. Many of the
rich were making large contribu ons.
42 One poor widow came up and put in
two small coins--a measly two cents.
43 Jesus called his disciples over and
said, "The truth is that this poor widow
gave more to the collec on than all the
others put together.
44 All the others gave what they'll never
miss; she gave extravagantly what she
couldn't aﬀord--she gave her all."MARK 13
13
81
1 As he walked away from the
Temple, one of his disciples said,
"Teacher, look at that stonework! Those
buildings!"
2 Jesus said, "You're impressed by this
grandiose architecture? There's not a
stone in the whole works that is not
going to end up in a heap of rubble."
3 Later, as he was si ng on Mount
Olives in full view of the Temple, Peter,
James, John, and Andrew got him oﬀ by
himself and asked,
4 "Tell us, when is this going to happen?
What sign will we get that things are
coming to a head?"
5 Jesus began, "Watch out for doomsday
deceivers.
6 Many leaders are going to show up
with forged iden es claiming, 'I'm the
One.' They will deceive a lot of people.
7 When you hear of wars and rumored
wars, keep your head and don't panic.MARK 13
82
This is rou ne history, and no sign of the
end.
8 Na on will ﬁght na on and ruler ﬁght
ruler, over and over. Earthquakes will
occur in various places. There will be
famines. But these things are nothing
compared to what's coming.
9 "And watch out! They're going to drag
you into court. And then it will go from
bad to worse, dog-eat-dog, everyone at
your throat because you carry my name.
You're placed there as sen nels to truth.
10 The Message has to be preached all
across the world.
11 "When they bring you, betrayed, into
court, don't worry about what you'll say.
When the me comes, say what's on
your heart--the Holy Spirit will make his
witness in and through you.
12 "It's going to be brother killing
brother, father killing child, children
killing parents.MARK 13
83
13 There's no telling who will hate you
because of me. "Stay with it--that's what
is required. Stay with it to the end. You
won't be sorry; you'll be saved.
14 "But be ready to run for it when you
see the monster of desecra on set up
where it should never be. You who can
read, make sure you understand what
I'm talking about. If you're living in Judea
at the me, run for the hills;
15 if you're working in the yard, don't go
back to the house to get anything;
16 if you're out in the ﬁeld, don't go
back to get your coat.
17 Pregnant and nursing mothers will
have it especially hard.
18 Hope and pray this won't happen in
the middle of winter.
19 "These are going to be hard days--
nothing like it from the me God made
the world right up to the present. And
there'll be nothing like it again.MARK 13
84
20 If he let the days of trouble run
their course, nobody would make it. But
because of God's chosen people, those
he personally chose, he has already
intervened.
21 "If anyone tries to ﬂag you down,
calling out, 'Here's the Messiah!' or
points, 'There he is!' don't fall for it.
22 Fake Messiahs and lying preachers
are going to pop up everywhere. Their
impressive creden als and dazzling
performances will pull the wool over the
eyes of even those who ought to know
be er.
23 So watch out. I've given you fair
warning.
24 "Following those hard mes, Sun will
fade out, moon cloud over,
25 Stars fall out of the sky, cosmic
powers tremble.MARK 13
85
26 "And then they'll see the Son of Man
enter in grand style, his Arrival ﬁlling the
sky--no one will miss it!
27 He'll dispatch the angels; they will
pull in the chosen from the four winds,
from pole to pole.
28 "Take a lesson from the ﬁg tree. From
the moment you no ce its buds form,
the merest hint of green, you know
summer's just around the corner.
29 And so it is with you. When you see
all these things, you know he is at the
door.
30 Don't take this lightly. I'm not just
saying this for some future genera on,
but for this one, too--these things will
happen.
31 Sky and earth will wear out; my
words won't wear out.
32 "But the exact day and hour? No one
knows that, not even heaven's angels,
not even the Son. Only the Father.MARK 13 – 14
86
33 So keep a sharp lookout, for you
don't know the metable.
34 It's like a man who takes a trip,
leaving home and pu ng his servants
in charge, each assigned a task, and
commanding the gatekeeper to stand
watch.
35 So, stay at your post, watching. You
have no idea when the homeowner is
returning, whether evening, midnight,
cockcrow, or morning.
36 You don't want him showing up
unannounced, with you asleep on the
job.
37 I say it to you, and I'm saying it to all:
Stay at your post. Keep watch."
1 In only two days the eight-day
Fes val of Passover and the Feast
of Unleavened Bread would begin. The
high priests and religion scholars were
looking for a way they could seize Jesus
by stealth and kill him.
14MARK 14
87
2 They agreed that it should not be
done during Passover Week. "We don't
want the crowds up in arms," they said.
3 Jesus was at Bethany, a guest of Simon
the Leper. While he was ea ng dinner, a
woman came up carrying a bo le of very
expensive perfume. Opening the bo le,
she poured it on his head.
4 Some of the guests became furious
among themselves. "That's criminal! A
sheer waste!
5 This perfume could have been sold for
well over a year's wages and handed out
to the poor." They swelled up in anger,
nearly burs ng with indigna on over
her.
6 But Jesus said, "Let her alone. Why are
you giving her a hard me? She has just
done something wonderfully signiﬁcant
for me.
7 You will have the poor with you every
day for the rest of your lives. WheneverMARK 14
88
you feel like it, you can do something for
them. Not so with me.
8 She did what she could when she
could--she pre-anointed my body for
burial.
9 And you can be sure that wherever
in the whole world the Message is
preached, what she just did is going to
be talked about admiringly."
10 Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve,
went to the cabal of high priests,
determined to betray him.
11 They couldn't believe their ears, and
promised to pay him well. He started
looking for just the right moment to
hand him over.
12 On the ﬁrst of the Days of Unleavened
Bread, the day they prepare the Passover
sacriﬁce, his disciples asked him, "Where
do you want us to go and make
prepara ons so you can eat the Passover
meal?"MARK 14
89
13 He directed two of his disciples, "Go
into the city. A man carrying a water jug
will meet you. Follow him.
14 Ask the owner of whichever house
he enters, 'The Teacher wants to know,
Where is my guest room where I can eat
the Passover meal with my disciples?'
15 He will show you a spacious second-
story room, swept and ready. Prepare
for us there."
16 The disciples le , came to the city,
found everything just as he had told
them, and prepared the Passover meal.
17 A er sunset he came with the
Twelve.
18 As they were at the supper table
ea ng, Jesus said, "I have something
hard but important to say to you: One
of you is going to hand me over to the
conspirators, one who at this moment is
ea ng with me."MARK 14
90
19 Stunned, they started asking, one
a er another, "It isn't me, is it?"
20 He said, "It's one of the Twelve, one
who eats with me out of the same bowl.
21 In one sense, it turns out that
the Son of Man is entering into a
way of treachery well-marked by the
Scriptures--no surprises here. In another
sense, the man who turns him in, turns
traitor to the Son of Man--be er never
to have been born than do this!"
22 In the course of their meal, having
taken and blessed the bread, he broke it
and gave it to them. Then he said, Take,
this is my body.
23 Taking the chalice, he gave it to them,
thanking God, and they all drank from it.
24 He said, This is my blood, God's new
covenant, Poured out for many people.
25 "I'll not be drinking wine again un l
the new day when I drink it in the
kingdom of God."MARK 14
91
26 They sang a hymn and then went
directly to Mount Olives.
27 Jesus told them, "You're all going to
feel that your world is falling apart and
that it's my fault. There's a Scripture
that says, I will strike the shepherd; The
sheep will go helter-skelter.
28 "But a er I am raised up, I will
go ahead of you, leading the way to
Galilee."
29 Peter blurted out, "Even if everyone
else is ashamed of you when things fall
to pieces, I won't be."
30 Jesus said, "Don't be so sure. Today,
this very night in fact, before the rooster
crows twice, you will deny me three
mes."
31 He blustered in protest, "Even if I
have to die with you, I will never deny
you." All the others said the same thing.MARK 14
92
32 They came to an area called
Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples, "Sit
here while I pray."
33 He took Peter, James, and John
with him. He plunged into a sinkhole of
dreadful agony.
34 He told them, "I feel bad enough
right now to die. Stay here and keep vigil
with me."
35 Going a li le ahead, he fell to the
ground and prayed for a way out:
36 "Papa, Father, you can--can't
you?--get me out of this. Take this cup
away from me. But please, not what I
want--what do you want?"
37 He came back and found them sound
asleep. He said to Peter, "Simon, you
went to sleep on me? Can't you s ck it
out with me a single hour?
38 Stay alert, be in prayer, so you don't
enter the danger zone without even
knowing it. Don't be naive. Part of youMARK 14
93
is eager, ready for anything in God; but
another part is as lazy as an old dog
sleeping by the ﬁre."
39 He then went back and prayed the
same prayer.
40 Returning, he again found them
sound asleep. They simply couldn't keep
their eyes open, and they didn't have a
plausible excuse.
41 He came back a third me and
said, "Are you going to sleep all night?
No--you've slept long enough. Time's up.
The Son of Man is about to be betrayed
into the hands of sinners.
42 Get up. Let's get going. My betrayer
has arrived."
43 No sooner were the words out of
his mouth when Judas, the one out of
the Twelve, showed up, and with him
a gang of ruﬃans, sent by the high
priests, religion scholars, and leaders,
brandishing swords and clubs.MARK 14
94
44 The betrayer had worked out a signal
with them: "The one I kiss, that's the
one--seize him. Make sure he doesn't
get away."
45 He went straight to Jesus and said,
"Rabbi!" and kissed him.
46 The others then grabbed him and
roughed him up.
47 One of the men standing there
unsheathed his sword, swung, and came
down on the Chief Priest's servant,
lopping oﬀ the man's ear.
48 Jesus said to them, "What is this,
coming a er me with swords and clubs
as if I were a dangerous criminal?
49 Day a er day I've been si ng in the
Temple teaching, and you never so much
as li ed a hand against me. What you in
fact have done is conﬁrm the prophe c
wri ngs."
50 All the disciples cut and ran.MARK 14
95
51 A young man was following along. All
he had on was a bedsheet. Some of the
men grabbed him
52 but he got away, running oﬀ naked,
leaving them holding the sheet.
53 They led Jesus to the Chief Priest,
where the high priests, religious leaders,
and scholars had gathered together.
54 Peter followed at a safe distance un l
they got to the Chief Priest's courtyard,
where he mingled with the servants and
warmed himself at the ﬁre.
55 The high priests conspiring with the
Jewish Council looked high and low for
evidence against Jesus by which they
could sentence him to death. They found
nothing.
56 Plenty of people were willing to bring
in false charges, but nothing added up,
and they ended up canceling each other
out.MARK 14
96
57 Then a few of them stood up and
lied:
58 "We heard him say, 'I am going to
tear down this Temple, built by hard
labor, and in three days build another
without li ing a hand.'"
59 But even they couldn't agree exactly.
60 In the middle of this, the Chief Priest
stood up and asked Jesus, "What do you
have to say to the accusa on?"
61 Jesus was silent. He said nothing. The
Chief Priest tried again, this me asking,
"Are you the Messiah, the Son of the
Blessed?"
62 Jesus said, "Yes, I am, and you'll see
it yourself: The Son of Man seated At the
right hand of the Mighty One, Arriving
on the clouds of heaven."
63 The Chief Priest lost his temper.
Ripping his clothes, he yelled, "Did
you hear that? A er that do we need
witnesses?MARK 14
97
64 You heard the blasphemy. Are you
going to stand for it?" They condemned
him, one and all. The sentence: death.
65 Some of them started spi ng at him.
They blindfolded his eyes, then hit him,
saying, "Who hit you? Prophesy!" The
guards, punching and slapping, took him
away.
66 While all this was going on, Peter was
down in the courtyard. One of the Chief
Priest's servant girls came in
67 and, seeing Peter warming himself
there, looked hard at him and said, "You
were with the Nazarene, Jesus."
68 He denied it: "I don't know what
you're talking about." He went out on
the porch. A rooster crowed.
69 The girl spo ed him and began telling
the people standing around, "He's one
of them."
70 He denied it again. A er a li le while,
the bystanders brought it up again.MARK 14 – 15
98
"You've got to be one of them. You've
got 'Galilean' wri en all over you."
71 Now Peter got really nervous and
swore, "I never laid eyes on this man
you're talking about."
72 Just then the rooster crowed a
second me. Peter remembered how
Jesus had said, "Before a rooster crows
twice, you'll deny me three mes." He
collapsed in tears.
1 At dawn's ﬁrst light, the high
priests, with the religious leaders
and scholars, arranged a conference
with the en re Jewish Council. A er
tying Jesus securely, they took him out
and presented him to Pilate.
2 Pilate asked him, "Are you the 'King of
the Jews'?" He answered, "If you say so."
3 The high priests let loose a barrage of
accusa ons.
15MARK 15
99
4 Pilate asked again, "Aren't you going
to answer anything? That's quite a list of
accusa ons."
5 S ll, he said nothing. Pilate was
impressed, really impressed.
6 It was a custom at the Feast to release
a prisoner, anyone the people asked for.
7 There was one prisoner called
Barabbas, locked up with the
insurrec onists who had commi ed
murder during the uprising against
Rome.
8 As the crowd came up and began to
present its pe on for him to release a
prisoner,
9 Pilate an cipated them: "Do you want
me to release the King of the Jews to
you?"
10 Pilate knew by this me that it was
through sheer spite that the high priests
had turned Jesus over to him.MARK 15
100
11 But the high priests by then had
worked up the crowd to ask for the
release of Barabbas.
12 Pilate came back, "So what do I do
with this man you call King of the Jews?"
13 They yelled, "Nail him to a cross!"
14 Pilate objected, "But for what
crime?" But they yelled all the louder,
"Nail him to a cross!"
15 Pilate gave the crowd what it wanted,
set Barabbas free and turned Jesus over
for whipping and cruciﬁxion.
16 The soldiers took Jesus into the
palace (called Praetorium) and called
together the en re brigade.
17 They dressed him up in purple and
put a crown plaited from a thorn bush
on his head.
18 Then they began their mockery:
"Bravo, King of the Jews!"MARK 15
101
19 They banged on his head with a club,
spit on him, and knelt down in mock
worship.
20 A er they had had their fun, they
took oﬀ the purple cape and put his own
clothes back on him. Then they marched
out to nail him to the cross.
21 There was a man walking by, coming
from work, Simon from Cyrene, the
father of Alexander and Rufus. They
made him carry Jesus' cross.
22 The soldiers brought Jesus to
Golgotha, meaning "Skull Hill."
23 They oﬀered him a mild painkiller
(wine mixed with myrrh), but he
wouldn't take it.
24 And they nailed him to the cross.
They divided up his clothes and threw
dice to see who would get them.
25 They nailed him up at nine o'clock in
the morning.MARK 15
102
26 The charge against him--THE KING OF
THE JEWS--was printed on a poster.
27 Along with him, they cruciﬁed two
criminals, one to his right, the other to
his le .
29 People passing along the road jeered,
shaking their heads in mock lament:
"You bragged that you could tear down
the Temple and then rebuild it in three
days--
30 so show us your stuﬀ! Save yourself!
If you're really God's Son, come down
from that cross!"
31 The high priests, along with the
religion scholars, were right there mixing
it up with the rest of them, having a
great me poking fun at him: "He saved
others--but he can't save himself!
32 Messiah, is he? King of Israel? Then
let him climb down from that cross.
We'll all become believers then!" EvenMARK 15
103
the men cruciﬁed alongside him joined
in the mockery.
33 At noon the sky became extremely
dark.
34 The darkness lasted three hours. At
three o'clock, Jesus groaned out of the
depths, crying loudly, ["Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?"] which means, "My God,
my God, why have you abandoned me?"
35 Some of the bystanders who heard
him said, "Listen, he's calling for Elijah."
36 Someone ran oﬀ, soaked a sponge in
sour wine, put it on a s ck, and gave it
to him to drink, saying, "Let's see if Elijah
comes to take him down."
37 But Jesus, with a loud cry, gave his
last breath.
38 At that moment the Temple curtain
ripped right down the middle.
39 When the Roman captain standing
guard in front of him saw that he hadMARK 15
104
quit breathing, he said, "This has to be
the Son of God!"
40 There were women watching from a
distance, among them Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of the younger James
and Joses, and Salome.
41 When Jesus was in Galilee, these
women followed and served him, and
had come up with him to Jerusalem.
42 Late in the a ernoon, since it was
the Day of Prepara on (that is, Sabbath
eve),
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a highly
respected member of the Jewish
Council, came. He was one who lived
expectantly, on the lookout for the
kingdom of God. Working up his
courage, he went to Pilate and asked for
Jesus' body.
44 Pilate ques oned whether he could
be dead that soon and called for the
captain to verify that he was really dead.MARK 15 – 16
105
45 Assured by the captain, he gave
Joseph the corpse.
46 Having already purchased a linen
shroud, Joseph took him down, wrapped
him in the shroud, placed him in a tomb
that had been cut into the rock, and
rolled a large stone across the opening.
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary, mother
of Joses, watched the burial.
1 When the Sabbath was over,
Mary Magdalene, Mary the
mother of James, and Salome bought
spices so they could embalm him.
2 Very early on Sunday morning, as the
sun rose, they went to the tomb.
3 They worried out loud to each other,
"Who will roll back the stone from the
tomb for us?"
4 Then they looked up, saw that it
had been rolled back--it was a huge
stone--and walked right in.
16MARK 16
5 They saw a young man si
106
ng on the
right side, dressed all in white. They were
completely taken aback, astonished.
6 He said, "Don't be afraid. I know
you're looking for Jesus the Nazarene,
the One they nailed on the cross. He's
been raised up; he's here no longer. You
can see for yourselves that the place is
empty.
7 Now--on your way. Tell his disciples
and Peter that he is going on ahead
of you to Galilee. You'll see him there,
exactly as he said."
8 They got out as fast as they could,
beside themselves, their heads
swimming. Stunned, they said nothing
to anyone.
9 {Mark 16:9-20 [[the por on in
brackets]] is contained only in later
manuscripts.} [[A er rising from the
dead, Jesus appeared early on SundayMARK 16
107
morning to Mary Magdalene, whom he
had delivered from seven demons.
10 She went to his former companions,
now weeping and carrying on, and told
them.
11 When they heard her report that she
had seen him alive and well, they didn't
believe her.
12 Later he appeared, but in a diﬀerent
form, to two of them out walking in the
countryside.
13 They went back and told the rest, but
they weren't believed either.
14 S ll later, as the Eleven were ea ng
supper, he appeared and took them to
task most severely for their stubborn
unbelief, refusing to believe those who
had seen him raised up.
15 Then he said, "Go into the world. Go
everywhere and announce the Message
of God's good news to one and all.MARK 16
16 Whoever believes and is bap
108
zed
is saved; whoever refuses to believe is
damned.
17 "These are some of the signs that will
accompany believers: They will throw
out demons in my name, they will speak
in new tongues,
18 they will take snakes in their hands,
they will drink poison and not be hurt,
they will lay hands on the sick and make
them well."
19 Then the Master Jesus, a er brieﬁng
them, was taken up to heaven, and he
sat down beside God in the place of
honor.
20 And the disciples went everywhere
preaching, the Master working right
with them, valida ng the Message with
indisputable evidence.]]Luke

1 So many others have tried their
hand at pu ng together a story of
the wonderful harvest of Scripture and
history that took place among us,
2 using reports handed down by the
original eyewitnesses who served this
Word with their very lives.
3 Since I have inves gated all the
reports in close detail, star ng from the
story's beginning, I decided to write it all
out for you, most honorable Theophilus,
4 so you can know beyond the shadow
of a doubt the reliability of what you
were taught.
5 During the rule of Herod, King of
Judea, there was a priest assigned
service in the regiment of Abijah. His
name was Zachariah. His wife wasLUKE 1
2
descended from the daughters of Aaron.
Her name was Elizabeth.
6 Together they lived honorably before
God, careful in keeping to the ways of
the commandments and enjoying a clear
conscience before God.
7 But they were childless because
Elizabeth could never conceive, and now
they were quite old.
8 It so happened that as Zachariah was
carrying out his priestly du es before
God, working the shi assigned to his
regiment,
9 it came his one turn in life to enter the
sanctuary of God and burn incense.
10 The congrega on was gathered and
praying outside the Temple at the hour
of the incense oﬀering.
11 Unannounced, an angel of God
appeared just to the right of the altar of
incense.
12 Zachariah was paralyzed in fear.LUKE 1
3
13 But the angel reassured him, "Don't
fear, Zachariah. Your prayer has been
heard. Elizabeth, your wife, will bear a
son by you. You are to name him John.
14 You're going to leap like a gazelle for
joy, and not only you--many will delight
in his birth.
15 He'll achieve great stature with God.
"He'll drink neither wine nor beer. He'll
be ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit from the
moment he leaves his mother's womb.
16 He will turn many sons and daughters
of Israel back to their God.
17 He will herald God's arrival in the
style and strength of Elijah, so en the
hearts of parents to children, and kindle
devout understanding among hardened
skep cs--he'll get the people ready for
God."
18 Zachariah said to the angel, "Do you
expect me to believe this? I'm an old
man and my wife is an old woman."LUKE 1
4
19 But the angel said, "I am Gabriel, the
sen nel of God, sent especially to bring
you this glad news.
20 But because you won't believe me,
you'll be unable to say a word un l
the day of your son's birth. Every word
I've spoken to you will come true on
me--God's me."
21 Meanwhile, the congrega on wai ng
for Zachariah was ge ng restless,
wondering what was keeping him so
long in the sanctuary.
22 When he came out and couldn't
speak, they knew he had seen a vision.
He con nued speechless and had to use
sign language with the people.
23 When the course of his priestly
assignment was completed, he went
back home.
24 It wasn't long before his wife,
Elizabeth, conceived. She went oﬀ byLUKE 1
5
herself for ﬁve months, relishing her
pregnancy.
25 "So, this is how God acts to remedy
my unfortunate condi on!" she said.
26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth's
pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to
the Galilean village of Nazareth
27 to a virgin engaged to be married to
a man descended from David. His name
was Joseph, and the virgin's name, Mary.
28 Upon entering, Gabriel greeted her:
Good morning! You're beau ful with
God's beauty, Beau ful inside and out!
God be with you.
29 She was thoroughly shaken,
wondering what was behind a gree ng
like that.
30 But the angel assured her, "Mary, you
have nothing to fear. God has a surprise
for you:
31 You will become pregnant and give
birth to a son and call his name Jesus.LUKE 1
6
32 He will be great, be called 'Son of the
Highest.' The Lord God will give him the
throne of his father David;
33 He will rule Jacob's house forever--no
end, ever, to his kingdom."
34 Mary said to the angel, "But how?
I've never slept with a man."
35 The angel answered, The Holy Spirit
will come upon you, the power of the
Highest hover over you; Therefore, the
child you bring to birth will be called
Holy, Son of God.
36 "And did you know that your cousin
Elizabeth conceived a son, old as she is?
Everyone called her barren, and here
she is six months' pregnant!
37 Nothing, you see, is impossible with
God."
38 And Mary said, Yes, I see it all now:
I'm the Lord's maid, ready to serve. Let
it be with me just as you say. Then the
angel le her.LUKE 1
7
39 Mary didn't waste a minute. She got
up and traveled to a town in Judah in the
hill country,
40 straight to Zachariah's house, and
greeted Elizabeth.
41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's
gree ng, the baby in her womb leaped.
She was ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit,
42 and sang out exuberantly, You're so
blessed among women, and the babe in
your womb, also blessed!
43 And why am I so blessed that the
mother of my Lord visits me?
44 The moment the sound of your
gree ng entered my ears, The babe in
my womb skipped like a lamb for sheer
joy.
45 Blessed woman, who believed what
God said, believed every word would
come true!
46 And Mary said, I'm burs ng with
God-news;LUKE 1
8
47 I'm dancing the song of my Savior
God.
48 God took one good look at me,
and look what happened--I'm the most
fortunate woman on earth! What God
has done for me will never be forgo en,
49 the God whose very name is holy, set
apart from all others
50 His mercy ﬂows in wave a er wave
on those who are in awe before him.
51 He bared his arm and showed
his strength, sca ered the bluﬃng
braggarts.
52 He knocked tyrants oﬀ their high
horses, pulled vic ms out of the mud.
53 The starving poor sat down to a
banquet; the callous rich were le out in
the cold.
54 He embraced his chosen child,
Israel; he remembered and piled on the
mercies, piled them high.LUKE 1
9
55 It's exactly what he promised,
beginning with Abraham and right up to
now.
56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three
months and then went back to her own
home.
57 When Elizabeth was full-term in her
pregnancy, she bore a son.
58 Her neighbors and rela ves, seeing
that God had overwhelmed her with
mercy, celebrated with her.
59 On the eighth day, they came to
circumcise the child and were calling him
Zachariah a er his father.
60 But his mother intervened: "No. He
is to be called John."
61 "But," they said, "no one in your
family is named that."
62 They used sign language to ask
Zachariah what he wanted him named.LUKE 1
10
63 Asking for a tablet, Zachariah wrote,
"His name is to be John." That took
everyone by surprise.
64 Surprise followed surprise--
Zachariah's mouth was now open,
his tongue loose, and he was talking,
praising God!
65 A deep, reveren al fear se led over
the neighborhood, and in all that Judean
hill country people talked about nothing
else.
66 Everyone who heard about it took it
to heart, wondering, "What will become
of this child? Clearly, God has his hand in
this."
67 Then Zachariah was ﬁlled with the
Holy Spirit and prophesied,
68 Blessed be the Lord, the God of
Israel; he came and set his people free.
69 He set the power of salva on in the
center of our lives, and in the very house
of David his servant,LUKE 1
11
70 Just as he promised long ago through
the preaching of his holy prophets:
71 Deliverance from our enemies and
every hateful hand;
72 Mercy to our fathers, as he
remembers to do what he said he'd do,
73 What he swore to our father
Abraham--
74 a clean rescue from the enemy camp,
So we can worship him without a care in
the world,
75 made holy before him as long as we
live.
76 And you, my child, "Prophet of the
Highest," will go ahead of the Master to
prepare his ways,
77 Present the oﬀer of salva on to his
people, the forgiveness of their sins.
78 Through the hear elt mercies of our
God, God's Sunrise will break in upon us,
79 Shining on those in the darkness,
those si ng in the shadow of death,LUKE 1 – 2
12
Then showing us the way, one foot at a
me, down the path of peace.
80 The child grew up, healthy and
spirited. He lived out in the desert un l
the day he made his prophe c debut in
Israel.
1 About that me Caesar Augustus
ordered a census to be taken
throughout the Empire.
2 This was the ﬁrst census when
Quirinius was governor of Syria.
3 Everyone had to travel to his own
ancestral hometown to be accounted
for.
4 So Joseph went from the Galilean
town of Nazareth up to Bethlehem in
Judah, David's town, for the census. As a
descendant of David, he had to go there.
5 He went with Mary, his ﬁance, who
was pregnant.
6 While they were there, the me came
for her to give birth.
2LUKE 2
13
7 She gave birth to a son, her ﬁrstborn.
She wrapped him in a blanket and laid
him in a manger, because there was no
room in the hostel.
8 There were sheepherders camping in
the neighborhood. They had set night
watches over their sheep.
9 Suddenly, God's angel stood among
them and God's glory blazed around
them. They were terriﬁed.
10 The angel said, "Don't be afraid. I'm
here to announce a great and joyful
event that is meant for everybody,
worldwide:
11 A Savior has just been born in David's
town, a Savior who is Messiah and
Master.
12 This is what you're to look for: a
baby wrapped in a blanket and lying in a
manger."
13 At once the angel was joined by a
huge angelic choir singing God's praises:LUKE 2
14
14 Glory to God in the heavenly heights,
Peace to all men and women on earth
who please him.
15 As the angel choir withdrew into
heaven, the sheepherders talked it over.
"Let's get over to Bethlehem as fast as
we can and see for ourselves what God
has revealed to us."
16 They le , running, and found Mary
and Joseph, and the baby lying in the
manger.
17 Seeing was believing. They told
everyone they met what the angels had
said about this child.
18 All who heard the sheepherders were
impressed.
19 Mary kept all these things to herself,
holding them dear, deep within herself.
20 The sheepherders returned and let
loose, glorifying and praising God for
everything they had heard and seen. ItLUKE 2
15
turned out exactly the way they'd been
told!
21 When the eighth day arrived, the day
of circumcision, the child was named
Jesus, the name given by the angel
before he was conceived.
22 Then when the days s pulated by
Moses for puriﬁca on were complete,
they took him up to Jerusalem to oﬀer
him to God
23 as commanded in God's Law: "Every
male who opens the womb shall be a
holy oﬀering to God,"
24 and also to sacriﬁce the "pair of
doves or two young pigeons" prescribed
in God's Law.
25 In Jerusalem at the me, there
was a man, Simeon by name, a good
man, a man who lived in the prayerful
expectancy of help for Israel. And the
Holy Spirit was on him.LUKE 2
16
26 The Holy Spirit had shown him that
he would see the Messiah of God before
he died.
27 Led by the Spirit, he entered the
Temple. As the parents of the child Jesus
brought him in to carry out the rituals of
the Law,
28 Simeon took him into his arms and
blessed God:
29 God, you can now release your
servant; release me in peace as you
promised.
30 With my own eyes I've seen your
salva on;
31 it's now out in the open for everyone
to see:
32 A God-revealing light to the non-
Jewish na ons, and of glory for your
people Israel.
33 Jesus' father and mother were
speechless with surprise at these words.LUKE 2
17
34 Simeon went on to bless them, and
said to Mary his mother, This child marks
both the failure and the recovery of
many in Israel, A ﬁgure misunderstood
and contradicted--
35 the pain of a sword-thrust through
you--But the rejec on will force honesty,
as God reveals who they really are.
36 Anna the prophetess was also there,
a daughter of Phanuel from the tribe
of Asher. She was by now a very old
woman. She had been married seven
years
37 and a widow for eighty-four. She
never le the Temple area, worshiping
night and day with her fas ngs and
prayers.
38 At the very me Simeon was praying,
she showed up, broke into an anthem of
praise to God, and talked about the child
to all who were wai ng expectantly for
the freeing of Jerusalem.LUKE 2
18
39 When they ﬁnished everything
required by God in the Law, they
returned to Galilee and their own town,
Nazareth.
40 There the child grew strong in body
and wise in spirit. And the grace of God
was on him.
41 Every year Jesus' parents traveled to
Jerusalem for the Feast of Passover.
42 When he was twelve years old, they
went up as they always did for the Feast.
43 When it was over and they le for
home, the child Jesus stayed behind in
Jerusalem, but his parents didn't know
it.
44 Thinking he was somewhere in the
company of pilgrims, they journeyed for
a whole day and then began looking for
him among rela ves and neighbors.
45 When they didn't ﬁnd him, they went
back to Jerusalem looking for him.LUKE 2
19
46 The next day they found him in the
Temple seated among the teachers,
listening to them and asking ques ons.
47 The teachers were all quite taken
with him, impressed with the sharpness
of his answers.
48 But his parents were not impressed;
they were upset and hurt. His mother
said, "Young man, why have you done
this to us? Your father and I have been
half out of our minds looking for you."
49 He said, "Why were you looking
for me? Didn't you know that I had to
be here, dealing with the things of my
Father?"
50 But they had no idea what he was
talking about.
51 So he went back to Nazareth with
them, and lived obediently with them.
His mother held these things dearly,
deep within herself.LUKE 2 – 3
20
52 And Jesus matured, growing up in
both body and spirit, blessed by both
God and people.
1 In the ﬁ eenth year of the rule of
Caesar Tiberius--it was while Pon us
Pilate was governor of Judea; Herod,
ruler of Galilee; his brother Philip, ruler
of Iturea and Trachoni s; Lysanias, ruler
of Abilene;
2 during the Chief-Priesthood of Annas
and Caiaphas--John, Zachariah's son,
out in the desert at the me, received a
message from God.
3 He went all through the country
around the Jordan River preaching
a bap sm of life-change leading to
forgiveness of sins,
4 as described in the words of Isaiah
the prophet: Thunder in the desert!
"Prepare God's arrival! Make the road
smooth and straight!
3LUKE 3
21
5 Every ditch will be ﬁlled in, Every
bump smoothed out, The detours
straightened out, All the ruts paved over.
6 Everyone will be there to see The
parade of God's salva on."
7 When crowds of people came out
for bap sm because it was the popular
thing to do, John exploded: "Brood of
snakes! What do you think you're doing
slithering down here to the river? Do you
think a li le water on your snakeskins is
going to deﬂect God's judgment?
8 It's your life that must change, not
your skin. And don't think you can pull
rank by claiming Abraham as 'father.'
Being a child of Abraham is neither here
nor there--children of Abraham are a
dime a dozen. God can make children
from stones if he wants.
9 What counts is your life. Is it green and
blossoming? Because if it's deadwood, it
goes on the ﬁre."LUKE 3
22
10 The crowd asked him, "Then what
are we supposed to do?"
11 "If you have two coats, give one
away," he said. "Do the same with your
food."
12 Tax men also came to be bap zed
and said, "Teacher, what should we do?"
13 He told them, "No more extor on-
-collect only what is required by
law."
14 Soldiers asked him, "And what should
we do?" He told them, "No shakedowns,
no blackmail--and be content with your
ra ons."
15 The interest of the people by now
was building. They were all beginning
to wonder, "Could this John be the
Messiah?"
16 But John intervened: "I'm bap zing
you here in the river. The main character
in this drama, to whom I'm a mere
stagehand, will ignite the kingdom life, aLUKE 3
23
ﬁre, the Holy Spirit within you, changing
you from the inside out.
17 He's going to clean house--make a
clean sweep of your lives. He'll place
everything true in its proper place before
God; everything false he'll put out with
the trash to be burned."
18 There was a lot more of this--words
that gave strength to the people, words
that put heart in them. The Message!
19 But Herod, the ruler, stung by John's
rebuke in the ma er of Herodias, his
brother Philip's wife,
20 capped his long string of evil deeds
with this outrage: He put John in jail.
21 A er all the people were bap zed,
Jesus was bap zed. As he was praying,
the sky opened up
22 and the Holy Spirit, like a dove
descending, came down on him. And
along with the Spirit, a voice: "You areLUKE 3
24
my Son, chosen and marked by my love,
pride of my life."
23 When Jesus entered public life he
was about thirty years old, the son
(in public percep on) of Joseph, who

1 Now Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,
le the Jordan and was led by the
Spirit into the wild.
4LUKE 4
26
2 For forty wilderness days and nights
he was tested by the Devil. He ate
nothing during those days, and when
the me was up he was hungry.
3 The Devil, playing on his hunger, gave
the ﬁrst test: "Since you're God's Son,
command this stone to turn into a loaf
of bread."
4 Jesus answered by quo ng
Deuteronomy: "It takes more than
bread to really live."
5 For the second test he led him up and
spread out all the kingdoms of the earth
on display at once.
6 Then the Devil said, "They're yours in
all their splendor to serve your pleasure.
I'm in charge of them all and can turn
them over to whomever I wish.
7 Worship me and they're yours, the
whole works."
8 Jesus refused, again backing his
refusal with Deuteronomy: "WorshipLUKE 4
27
the Lord your God and only the Lord
your God. Serve him with absolute
single-heartedness."
9 For the third test the Devil took him
to Jerusalem and put him on top of the
Temple. He said, "If you are God's Son,
jump.
10 It's wri en, isn't it, that 'he has
placed you in the care of angels to
protect you;
11 they will catch you; you won't so
much as stub your toe on a stone'?"
12 "Yes," said Jesus, "and it's also
wri en, 'Don't you dare tempt the Lord
your God.'"
13 That completed the tes ng. The Devil
retreated temporarily, lying in wait for
another opportunity.
14 Jesus returned to Galilee powerful in
the Spirit. News that he was back spread
through the countryside.LUKE 4
15 He taught in their mee
28
ng places to
everyone's acclaim and pleasure.
16 He came to Nazareth where he had
been reared. As he always did on the
Sabbath, he went to the mee ng place.
When he stood up to read,
17 he was handed the scroll of the
prophet Isaiah. Unrolling the scroll, he
found the place where it was wri en,
18 God's Spirit is on me; he's chosen me
to preach the Message of good news to
the poor, Sent me to announce pardon
to prisoners and recovery of sight to the
blind, To set the burdened and ba ered
free,
19 to announce, "This is God's year to
act!"
20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it back
to the assistant, and sat down. Every eye
in the place was on him, intent.LUKE 4
29
21 Then he started in, "You've just heard
Scripture make history. It came true just
now in this place."
22 All who were there, watching and
listening, were surprised at how well
he spoke. But they also said, "Isn't this
Joseph's son, the one we've known since
he was a youngster?"
23 He answered, "I suppose you're
going to quote the proverb, 'Doctor, go
heal yourself. Do here in your hometown
what we heard you did in Capernaum.'
24 Well, let me tell you something:
No prophet is ever welcomed in his
hometown.
25 Isn't it a fact that there were many
widows in Israel at the me of Elijah
during that three and a half years of
drought when famine devastated the
land,
26 but the only widow to whom Elijah
was sent was in Sarepta in Sidon?LUKE 4
30
27 And there were many lepers in Israel
at the me of the prophet Elisha but
the only one cleansed was Naaman the
Syrian."
28 That set everyone in the mee ng
place seething with anger.
29 They threw him out, banishing him
from the village, then took him to a
mountain cliﬀ at the edge of the village
to throw him to his doom,
30 but he gave them the slip and was on
his way.
31 He went down to Capernaum, a
village in Galilee. He was teaching the
people on the Sabbath.
32 They were surprised and impressed-
-his teaching was so forthright, so
conﬁdent, so authorita ve, not the
quibbling and quo ng they were used
to.LUKE 4
33 In the mee
31
ng place that day there
was a man demonically disturbed. He
screamed,
34 "Ho! What business do you have here
with us, Jesus? Nazarene! I know what
you're up to. You're the Holy One of God
and you've come to destroy us!"
35 Jesus shut him up: "Quiet! Get out of
him!" The demonic spirit threw the man
down in front of them all and le . The
demon didn't hurt him.
36 That set everyone back on their
heels, whispering and wondering,
"What's going on here? Someone whose
words make things happen? Someone
who orders demonic spirits to get out
and they go?"
37 Jesus was the talk of the town.
38 He le the mee ng place and went
to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law
was running a high fever and they asked
him to do something for her.LUKE 4
32
39 He stood over her, told the fever to
leave--and it le . Before they knew it,
she was up ge ng dinner for them.
40 When the sun went down, everyone
who had anyone sick with some ailment
or other brought them to him. One by
one he placed his hands on them and
healed them.
41 Demons le in droves, screaming,
"Son of God! You're the Son of God!" But
he shut them up, refusing to let them
speak because they knew too much,
knew him to be the Messiah.
42 He le the next day for open country.
But the crowds went looking and, when
they found him, clung to him so he
couldn't go on.
43 He told them, "Don't you realize that
there are yet other villages where I have
to tell the Message of God's kingdom,
that this is the work God sent me to do?"LUKE 4 – 5
44 Meanwhile he con
33
nued preaching
in the mee ng places of Galilee.
1 Once when he was standing on the
shore of Lake Gennesaret, the crowd
was pushing in on him to be er hear the
Word of God.
2 He no ced two boats ed up. The
ﬁshermen had just le them and were
out scrubbing their nets.
3 He climbed into the boat that was
Simon's and asked him to put out a li le
from the shore. Si ng there, using the
boat for a pulpit, he taught the crowd.
4 When he ﬁnished teaching, he said to
Simon, "Push out into deep water and
let your nets out for a catch."
5 Simon said, "Master, we've been
ﬁshing hard all night and haven't caught
even a minnow. But if you say so, I'll let
out the nets."
5LUKE 5
34
6 It was no sooner said than done--a
huge haul of ﬁsh, straining the nets past
capacity.
7 They waved to their partners in the
other boat to come help them. They
ﬁlled both boats, nearly swamping them
with the catch.
8 Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell to his
knees before Jesus. "Master, leave. I'm
a sinner and can't handle this holiness.
Leave me to myself."
9 When they pulled in that catch of ﬁsh,
awe overwhelmed Simon and everyone
with him.
10 It was the same with James and John,
Zebedee's sons, coworkers with Simon.
Jesus said to Simon, "There is nothing to
fear. From now on you'll be ﬁshing for
men and women."
11 They pulled their boats up on the
beach, le them, nets and all, and
followed him.LUKE 5
35
12 One day in one of the villages there
was a man covered with leprosy. When
he saw Jesus he fell down before him in
prayer and said, "If you want to, you can
cleanse me."
13 Jesus put out his hand, touched him,
and said, "I want to. Be clean." Then and
there his skin was smooth, the leprosy
gone.
14 Jesus instructed him, "Don't talk
about this all over town. Just quietly
present your healed self to the priest,
along with the oﬀering ordered by
Moses. Your cleansed and obedient life,
not your words, will bear witness to
what I have done."
15 But the man couldn't keep it to
himself, and the word got out. Soon a
large crowd of people had gathered to
listen and be healed of their ailments.
16 As o en as possible Jesus withdrew
to out-of-the-way places for prayer.LUKE 5
36
17 One day as he was teaching,
Pharisees and religion teachers were
si ng around. They had come from
nearly every village in Galilee and Judea,
even as far away as Jerusalem, to be
there. The healing power of God was on
him.
18 Some men arrived carrying a
paraplegic on a stretcher. They were
looking for a way to get into the house
and set him before Jesus.
19 When they couldn't ﬁnd a way in
because of the crowd, they went up on
the roof, removed some les, and let
him down in the middle of everyone,
right in front of Jesus.
20 Impressed by their bold belief, he
said, "Friend, I forgive your sins."
21 That set the religion scholars and
Pharisees buzzing. "Who does he think
he is? That's blasphemous talk! God and
only God can forgive sins."LUKE 5
37
22 Jesus knew exactly what they were
thinking and said, "Why all this gossipy
whispering?
23 Which is simpler: to say 'I forgive
your sins,' or to say 'Get up and start
walking'?
24 Well, just so it's clear that I'm the
Son of Man and authorized to do either,
or both. ..."He now spoke directly to the
paraplegic: "Get up. Take your bedroll
and go home."
25 Without a moment's hesita on, he
did it--got up, took his blanket, and le
for home, giving glory to God all the way.
26 The people rubbed their eyes,
incredulous--and then also gave glory to
God. Awestruck, they said, "We've never
seen anything like that!"
27 A er this he went out and saw a man
named Levi at his work collec ng taxes.
Jesus said, "Come along with me."LUKE 5
38
28 And he did--walked away from
everything and went with him.
29 Levi gave a large dinner at his home
for Jesus. Everybody was there, tax men
and other disreputable characters as
guests at the dinner.
30 The Pharisees and their religion
scholars came to his disciples greatly
oﬀended. "What is he doing ea ng and
drinking with crooks and 'sinners'?"
31 Jesus heard about it and spoke up,
"Who needs a doctor: the healthy or the
sick?
32 I'm here invi ng outsiders, not
insiders--an invita on to a changed life,
changed inside and out."
33 They asked him, "John's disciples
are well-known for keeping fasts and
saying prayers. Also the Pharisees. But
you seem to spend most of your me at
par es. Why?"LUKE 5 – 6
34 Jesus said, "When you're celebra
39
ng
a wedding, you don't skimp on the cake
and wine. You feast. Later you may need
to pull in your belt, but this isn't the
me. As long as the bride and groom are
with you, you have a good me.
35 When the groom is gone, the fas ng
can begin. No one throws cold water on
a friendly bonﬁre. This is Kingdom Come!
36 "No one cuts up a ﬁne silk scarf to
patch old work clothes; you want fabrics
that match.
37 And you don't put wine in old,
cracked bo les;
38 you get strong, clean bo les for your
fresh vintage wine.
39 And no one who has ever tasted ﬁne
aged wine prefers unaged wine."
1 On a certain Sabbath Jesus was
walking through a ﬁeld of ripe grain.
His disciples were pulling oﬀ heads of
6LUKE 6
40
grain, rubbing them in their hands to get
rid of the chaﬀ, and ea ng them.
2 Some Pharisees said, "Why are you
doing that, breaking a Sabbath rule?"
3 But Jesus stood up for them. "Have
you never read what David and those
with him did when they were hungry?
4 How he entered the sanctuary and ate
fresh bread oﬀ the altar, bread that no
one but priests were allowed to eat? He
also handed it out to his companions."
5 Then he said, "The Son of Man is no
slave to the Sabbath; he's in charge."
6 On another Sabbath he went to the
mee ng place and taught. There was a
man there with a crippled right hand.
7 The religion scholars and Pharisees
had their eye on Jesus to see if he would
heal the man, hoping to catch him in a
Sabbath infrac on.
8 He knew what they were up to and
spoke to the man with the crippledLUKE 6
41
hand: "Get up and stand here before
us." He did.
9 Then Jesus addressed them, "Let me
ask you something: What kind of ac on
suits the Sabbath best? Doing good or
doing evil? Helping people or leaving
them helpless?"
10 He looked around, looked each one
in the eye. He said to the man, "Hold
out your hand." He held it out--it was as
good as new!
11 They were beside themselves with
anger, and started plo ng how they
might get even with him.
12 At about that same me he climbed a
mountain to pray. He was there all night
in prayer before God.
13 The next day he summoned his
disciples; from them he selected twelve
he designated as apostles:LUKE 6
42
14 Simon, whom he named Peter,
Andrew, his brother, James, John, Philip,
Bartholomew,
15 Ma hew, Thomas, James, son of
Alphaeus, Simon, called the Zealot,
16 Judas, son of James, Judas Iscariot,
who betrayed him.
17 Coming down oﬀ the mountain with
them, he stood on a plain surrounded by
disciples, and was soon joined by a huge
congrega on from all over Judea and
Jerusalem, even from the seaside towns
of Tyre and Sidon.
18 They had come both to hear him
and to be cured of their ailments. Those
disturbed by evil spirits were healed.
19 Everyone was trying to touch him--so
much energy surging from him, so many
people healed!
20 Then he spoke: You're blessed when
you've lost it all. God's kingdom is there
for the ﬁnding.LUKE 6
43
21 You're blessed when you're
ravenously hungry. Then you're ready
for the Messianic meal. You're blessed
when the tears ﬂow freely. Joy comes
with the morning.
22 "Count yourself blessed every me
someone cuts you down or throws you
out, every me someone smears or
blackens your name to discredit me.
What it means is that the truth is too
close for comfort and that that person is
uncomfortable.
23 You can be glad when that happens-
-skip like a lamb, if you like!--for even
though they don't like it, I do...and all
heaven applauds. And know that you
are in good company; my preachers and
witnesses have always been treated like
this.
24 But it's trouble ahead if you think you
have it made. What you have is all you'll
ever get.LUKE 6
44
25 And it's trouble ahead if you're

not sa sfy you for long. And it's trouble
ahead if you think life's all fun and
games. There's suﬀering to be met, and
you're going to meet it.
26 "There's trouble ahead when you
live only for the approval of others,
saying what ﬂa ers them, doing what
indulges them. Popularity contests are
not truth contests--look how many
scoundrel preachers were approved by
your ancestors! Your task is to be true,
not popular.
27 "To you who are ready for the truth,
I say this: Love your enemies. Let them
bring out the best in you, not the worst.
28 When someone gives you a hard

prayer for that person.

stand there and take it. If someone grabsLUKE 6

30 If someone takes unfair advantage

behavior: Ask yourself what you want
people to do for you; then grab the

32 If you only love the lovable, do you
expect a pat on the back? Run-of-the-mill
sinners do that.
33 If you only help those who help you,
do you expect a medal? Garden-variety
sinners do that.
34 If you only give for what you hope to
get out of it, do you think that's charity?
The s ngiest of pawnbrokers does that.

and give without expec ng a return.
You'll never--I promise--regret it. LiveLUKE 6

out this God-created iden ty the way
our Father lives toward us, generously
and graciously, even when we're at our
worst.
36 Our Father is kind; you be kind.
37 "Don't pick on people, jump on their
failures, cri cize their faults--unless, of
course, you want the same treatment.
Don't condemn those who are down;
that hardness can boomerang. Be easy
on people; you'll ﬁnd life a lot easier.
38 Give away your life; you'll ﬁnd
life given back, but not merely given
back--given back with bonus and
blessing. Giving, not ge ng, is the way.
Generosity begets generosity."
39 He quoted a proverb: "'Can a blind
man guide a blind man?' Wouldn't they
both end up in the ditch?
40 An appren ce doesn't lecture the
master. The point is to be careful who
you follow as your teacher.LUKE 6
47
41 "It's easy to see a smudge on your
neighbor's face and be oblivious to the
ugly sneer on your own.
42 Do you have the nerve to say, 'Let me
wash your face for you,' when your own
face is distorted by contempt? It's this
I-know-be er-than-you mentality again,
playing a holier-than-thou part instead
of just living your own part. Wipe that
ugly sneer oﬀ your own face and you
might be ﬁt to oﬀer a washcloth to your
neighbor.
43 "You don't get wormy apples oﬀ
a healthy tree, nor good apples oﬀ a
diseased tree.
44 The health of the apple tells the
health of the tree. You must begin with
your own life-giving lives.
45 It's who you are, not what you say
and do, that counts. Your true being
brims over into true words and deeds.LUKE 6
48
46 "Why are you so polite with me,
always saying 'Yes, sir,' and 'That's right,
sir,' but never doing a thing I tell you?
47 These words I speak to you are not
mere addi ons to your life, homeowner
improvements to your standard of living.
They are founda on words, words to
build a life on.
48 "If you work the words into your
life, you are like a smart carpenter who
dug deep and laid the founda on of his
house on bedrock. When the river burst
its banks and crashed against the house,
nothing could shake it; it was built to
last.
49 But if you just use my words in Bible
studies and don't work them into your
life, you are like a dumb carpenter who
built a house but skipped the founda on.
When the swollen river came crashing
in, it collapsed like a house of cards. It
was a total loss."LUKE 7

1 When he ﬁnished speaking to the
people, he entered Capernaum.
2 A Roman captain there had a servant
who was on his deathbed. He prized him
highly and didn't want to lose him.
3 When he heard Jesus was back, he
sent leaders from the Jewish community
asking him to come and heal his servant.
4 They came to Jesus and urged him to
do it, saying, "He deserves this.
5 He loves our people. He even built our
mee ng place."
6 Jesus went with them. When he was
s ll quite far from the house, the captain
sent friends to tell him, "Master, you
don't have to go to all this trouble. I'm
not that good a person, you know. I'd
be embarrassed for you to come to my
house,
7 even embarrassed to come to you
in person. Just give the order and my
servant will get well.LUKE 7
50
8 I'm a man under orders; I also give
orders. I tell one soldier, 'Go,' and he
goes; another, 'Come,' and he comes;
my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."
9 Taken aback, Jesus addressed the
accompanying crowd: "I've yet to come
across this kind of simple trust anywhere
in Israel, the very people who are
supposed to know about God and how
he works."
10 When the messengers got back
home, they found the servant up and
well.
11 Not long a er that, Jesus went to the
village Nain. His disciples were with him,
along with quite a large crowd.
12 As they approached the village
gate, they met a funeral procession--a
woman's only son was being carried out
for burial. And the mother was a widow.
13 When Jesus saw her, his heart broke.
He said to her, "Don't cry."LUKE 7
51
14 Then he went over and touched the
coﬃn. The pallbearers stopped. He said,
"Young man, I tell you: Get up."
15 The dead son sat up and began
talking. Jesus presented him to his
mother.
16 They all realized they were in a
place of holy mystery, that God was at
work among them. They were quietly
worshipful--and then noisily grateful,
calling out among themselves, "God
is back, looking to the needs of his
people!"
17 The news of Jesus spread all through
the country.
18 John's disciples reported back to him
the news of all these events taking place.
19 He sent two of them to the Master
to ask the ques on, "Are you the One
we've been expec ng, or are we s ll
wai ng?"LUKE 7
52
20 The men showed up before Jesus
and said, "John the Bap zer sent us to
ask you, 'Are you the One we've been
expec ng, or are we s ll wai ng?'"
21 In the next two or three hours Jesus
healed many from diseases, distress,
and evil spirits. To many of the blind he
gave the gi of sight.
22 Then he gave his answer: "Go back
and tell John what you have just seen
and heard: The blind see, The lame walk,
Lepers are cleansed, The deaf hear, The
dead are raised, The wretched of the
earth have God's salva on hospitality
extended to them.
23 "Is this what you were expec ng?
Then count yourselves fortunate!"
24 A er John's messengers le to make
their report, Jesus said more about John
to the crowd of people. "What did you
expect when you went out to see him in
the wild? A weekend camper?LUKE 7
53
25 Hardly. What then? A sheik in silk
pajamas? Not in the wilderness, not by a
long shot.
26 What then? A messenger from God?
That's right, a messenger! Probably the
greatest messenger you'll ever hear.
27 He is the messenger Malachi
announced when he wrote, I'm sending
my messenger on ahead To make the
road smooth for you.
28 "Let me lay it out for you as plainly
as I can: No one in history surpasses
John the Bap zer, but in the kingdom he
prepared you for, the lowliest person is
ahead of him.
29 The ordinary and disreputable people
who heard John, by being bap zed by
him into the kingdom, are the clearest
evidence;
30 the Pharisees and religious oﬃcials
would have nothing to do with such aLUKE 7
54
bap sm, wouldn't think of giving up
their place in line to their inferiors.
31 "How can I account for the people of
this genera on?
32 They're like spoiled children
complaining to their parents, 'We
wanted to skip rope and you were
always too red; we wanted to talk but
you were always too busy.'
33 John the Bap zer came fas ng and
you called him crazy.
34 The Son of Man came feas ng and
you called him a lush.
35 Opinion polls don't count for much,
do they? The proof of the pudding is in
the ea ng."
36 One of the Pharisees asked him over
for a meal. He went to the Pharisee's
house and sat down at the dinner table.
37 Just then a woman of the village, the
town harlot, having learned that Jesus
was a guest in the home of the Pharisee,LUKE 7
55
came with a bo le of very expensive
perfume
38 and stood at his feet, weeping,
raining tears on his feet. Le ng down
her hair, she dried his feet, kissed them,
and anointed them with the perfume.
39 When the Pharisee who had invited
him saw this, he said to himself, "If
this man was the prophet I thought he
was, he would have known what kind
of woman this is who is falling all over
him."
40 Jesus said to him, "Simon, I have
something to tell you." "Oh? Tell me."
41 "Two men were in debt to a banker.
One owed ﬁve hundred silver pieces, the
other ﬁ y.
42 Neither of them could pay up, and so
the banker canceled both debts. Which
of the two would be more grateful?"LUKE 7
56
43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one
who was forgiven the most." "That's
right," said Jesus.
44 Then turning to the woman, but
speaking to Simon, he said, "Do you see
this woman? I came to your home; you
provided no water for my feet, but she
rained tears on my feet and dried them
with her hair.
45 You gave me no gree ng, but from
the me I arrived she hasn't quit kissing
my feet.
46 You provided nothing for freshening
up, but she has soothed my feet with
perfume.
47 Impressive, isn't it? She was forgiven
many, many sins, and so she is very, very
grateful. If the forgiveness is minimal,
the gra tude is minimal."
48 Then he spoke to her: "I forgive your
sins."LUKE 7 – 8
57
49 That set the dinner guests talking
behind his back: "Who does he think he
is, forgiving sins!"
50 He ignored them and said to the
woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in
peace."
1 He con nued according to plan,
traveled to town a er town, village
a er village, preaching God's kingdom,
spreading the Message. The Twelve
were with him.
2 There were also some women in
their company who had been healed
of various evil aﬄic ons and illnesses:
Mary, the one called Magdalene, from
whom seven demons had gone out;
3 Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's
manager; and Susanna--along with many
others who used their considerable
means to provide for the company.
8LUKE 8
58
4 As they went from town to town, a lot
of people joined in and traveled along.
He addressed them, using this story:
5 "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
Some of it fell on the road; it was
tramped down and the birds ate it.
6 Other seed fell in the gravel; it
sprouted, but withered because it didn't
have good roots.
7 Other seed fell in the weeds; the
weeds grew with it and strangled it.
8 Other seed fell in rich earth and
produced a bumper crop. "Are you
listening to this? Really listening?"
9 His disciples asked, "Why did you tell
this story?"
10 He said, "You've been given insight
into God's kingdom--you know how
it works. There are others who need
stories. But even with stories some of
them aren't going to get it: Their eyesLUKE 8
59
are open but don't see a thing, Their
ears are open but don't hear a thing.
11 "This story is about some of those
people. The seed is the Word of God.
12 The seeds on the road are those
who hear the Word, but no sooner do
they hear it than the Devil snatches it
from them so they won't believe and be
saved.
13 "The seeds in the gravel are those
who hear with enthusiasm, but the
enthusiasm doesn't go very deep. It's
only another fad, and the moment
there's trouble it's gone.
14 "And the seed that fell in the
weeds--well, these are the ones who
hear, but then the seed is crowded out
and nothing comes of it as they go about
their lives worrying about tomorrow,
making money, and having fun.
15 "But the seed in the good earth--
these are the good-hearts who seizeLUKE 8
60
the Word and hold on no ma er what,
s cking with it un l there's a harvest.
16 "No one lights a lamp and then
covers it with a washtub or shoves it
under the bed. No, you set it up on a
lamp stand so those who enter the room
can see their way.
17 We're not keeping secrets; we're
telling them. We're not hiding things;
we're bringing everything out into the
open.
18 So be careful that you don't
become misers of what you hear.
Generosity begets generosity. S nginess
impoverishes."
19 His mother and brothers showed up
but couldn't get through to him because
of the crowd.
20 He was given the message, "Your
mother and brothers are standing
outside wan ng to see you."LUKE 8
61
21 He replied, "My mother and brothers
are the ones who hear and do God's
Word. Obedience is thicker than blood."
22 One day he and his disciples got in a
boat. "Let's cross the lake," he said. And
oﬀ they went.
23 It was smooth sailing, and he
fell asleep. A terriﬁc storm came up
suddenly on the lake. Water poured in,
and they were about to capsize.
24 They woke Jesus: "Master, Master,
we're going to drown!" Ge ng to his
feet, he told the wind, "Silence!" and the
waves, "Quiet down!" They did it. The
lake became smooth as glass.
25 Then he said to his disciples,
"Why can't you trust me?" They
were in absolute awe, staggered and
stammering, "Who is this, anyway? He
calls out to the winds and sea, and they
do what he tells them!"LUKE 8
62
26 They sailed on to the country of the
Gerasenes, directly opposite Galilee.
27 As he stepped out onto land, a
madman from town met him; he was
a vic m of demons. He hadn't worn
clothes for a long me, nor lived at
home; he lived in the cemetery.
28 When he saw Jesus he screamed,
fell before him, and bellowed, "What
business do you have messing with me?
You're Jesus, Son of the High God, but
don't give me a hard me!"
29 (The man said this because Jesus
had started to order the unclean spirit
out of him.) Time a er me the demon
threw the man into convulsions. He had
been placed under constant guard and
ed with chains and shackles, but crazed
and driven wild by the demon, he would
sha er the bonds.
30 Jesus asked him, "What is your
name?" "Mob. My name is Mob," heLUKE 8
63
said, because many demons aﬄicted
him.
31 And they begged Jesus desperately
not to order them to the bo omless pit.
32 A large herd of pigs was browsing
and roo ng on a nearby hill. The demons
begged Jesus to order them into the
pigs. He gave the order.
33 It was even worse for the pigs than
for the man. Crazed, they stampeded
over a cliﬀ into the lake and drowned.
34 Those tending the pigs, scared to
death, bolted and told their story in
town and country.
35 People went out to see what had
happened. They came to Jesus and
found the man from whom the demons
had been sent, si ng there at Jesus'
feet, wearing decent clothes and making
sense. It was a holy moment, and for
a short me they were more reverent
than curious.LUKE 8
64
36 Then those who had seen it happen
told how the demoniac had been saved.
37 Later, a great many people from the
Gerasene countryside got together and
asked Jesus to leave--too much change,
too fast, and they were scared. So Jesus
got back in the boat and set oﬀ.
38 The man whom he had delivered
from the demons asked to go with him,
but he sent him back, saying,
39 "Go home and tell everything God did
in you." So he went back and preached
all over town everything Jesus had done
in him.
40 On his return, Jesus was welcomed by
a crowd. They were all there expec ng
him.
41 A man came up, Jairus by name. He
was president of the mee ng place. He
fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to
come to his homeLUKE 8
65
42 because his twelve-year-old
daughter, his only child, was dying. Jesus
went with him, making his way through
the pushing, jostling crowd.
43 In the crowd that day there was a
woman who for twelve years had been
aﬄicted with hemorrhages. She had
spent every penny she had on doctors
but not one had been able to help her.
44 She slipped in from behind and
touched the edge of Jesus' robe. At
that very moment her hemorrhaging
stopped.
45 Jesus said, "Who touched me?"
When no one stepped forward, Peter
said, "But Master, we've got crowds
of people on our hands. Dozens have
touched you."
46 Jesus insisted, "Someone touched
me. I felt power discharging from me."
47 When the woman realized that
she couldn't remain hidden, she kneltLUKE 8
66
trembling before him. In front of all the
people, she blurted out her story--why
she touched him and how at that same
moment she was healed.
48 Jesus said, "Daughter, you took a risk
trus ng me, and now you're healed and
whole. Live well, live blessed!"
49 While he was s ll talking, someone
from the leader's house came up and
told him, "Your daughter died. No need
now to bother the Teacher."
50 Jesus overheard and said, "Don't be
upset. Just trust me and everything will
be all right."
51 Going into the house, he wouldn't
let anyone enter with him except Peter,
John, James, and the child's parents.
52 Everyone was crying and carrying
on over her. Jesus said, "Don't cry. She
didn't die; she's sleeping."
53 They laughed at him. They knew she
was dead.LUKE 8 – 9
67
54 Then Jesus, gripping her hand, called,
"My dear child, get up."
55 She was up in an instant, up and
breathing again! He told them to give
her something to eat.
56 Her parents were ecsta c, but Jesus
warned them to keep quiet. "Don't tell a
soul what happened in this room."
1 Jesus now called the Twelve and
gave them authority and power
to deal with all the demons and cure
diseases.
2 He commissioned them to preach the
news of God's kingdom and heal the
sick.
3 He said, "Don't load yourselves up
with equipment.
4 Keep it simple; you are the equipment.
And no luxury inns--get a modest place
and be content there un l you leave.
9LUKE 9
68
5 If you're not welcomed, leave
town. Don't make a scene. Shrug your
shoulders and move on."
6 Commissioned, they le . They
traveled from town to town telling the
latest news of God, the Message, and
curing people everywhere they went.
7 Herod, the ruler, heard of these goings
on and didn't know what to think. There
were people saying John had come back
from the dead,
8 others that Elijah had appeared, s ll
others that some prophet of long ago
had shown up.
9 Herod said, "But I killed John--took
oﬀ his head. So who is this that I keep
hearing about?" Curious, he looked for a
chance to see him in ac on.
10 The apostles returned and reported
on what they had done. Jesus took them
away, oﬀ by themselves, near the town
called Bethsaida.LUKE 9
69
11 But the crowds got wind of it and
followed. Jesus graciously welcomed
them and talked to them about the
kingdom of God. Those who needed
healing, he healed.
12 As the day declined, the Twelve said,
"Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the
farms or villages around here and get
a room for the night and a bite to eat.
We're out in the middle of nowhere."
13 "You feed them," Jesus said. They
said, "We couldn't scrape up more than
ﬁve loaves of bread and a couple of
ﬁsh--unless, of course, you want us to
go to town ourselves and buy food for
everybody."
14 (There were more than ﬁve thousand
people in the crowd.) But he went ahead
and directed his disciples, "Sit them
down in groups of about ﬁ y."
15 They did what he said, and soon had
everyone seated.LUKE 9
70
16 He took the ﬁve loaves and two
ﬁsh, li ed his face to heaven in prayer,
blessed, broke, and gave the bread and
ﬁsh to the disciples to hand out to the
crowd.
17 A er the people had all eaten their
ﬁll, twelve baskets of le overs were
gathered up.
18 One me when Jesus was oﬀ praying
by himself, his disciples nearby, he asked
them, "What are the crowds saying
about me, about who I am?"
19 They said, "John the Bap zer. Others
say Elijah. S ll others say that one of the
prophets from long ago has come back."
20 He then asked, "And you--what are
you saying about me? Who am I?" Peter
answered, "The Messiah of God."
21 Jesus then warned them to keep it
quiet. They were to tell no one what
Peter had said.LUKE 9
71
22 He went on, "It is necessary that the
Son of Man proceed to an ordeal of
suﬀering, be tried and found guilty by
the religious leaders, high priests, and
religion scholars, be killed, and on the
third day be raised up alive."
23 Then he told them what they could
expect for themselves: "Anyone who
intends to come with me has to let me
lead. You're not in the driver's seat--I
am. Don't run from suﬀering; embrace
it. Follow me and I'll show you how.
24 Self-help is no help at all. Self-
sacriﬁce is the way, my way, to ﬁnding
yourself, your true self.
25 What good would it do to get
everything you want and lose you, the
real you?
26 If any of you is embarrassed with
me and the way I'm leading you, know
that the Son of Man will be far more
embarrassed with you when he arrivesLUKE 9
72
in all his splendor in company with the
Father and the holy angels. This isn't,
you realize, pie in the sky by and by.
27 Some who have taken their stand
right here are going to see it happen,
see with their own eyes the kingdom of
God."
28 About eight days a er saying this, he
climbed the mountain to pray, taking
Peter, John, and James along.
29 While he was in prayer, the
appearance of his face changed and his
clothes became blinding white.
30 At once two men were there talking
with him. They turned out to be Moses
and Elijah--
31 and what a glorious appearance they
made! They talked over his exodus, the
one Jesus was about to complete in
Jerusalem.
32 Meanwhile, Peter and those with
him were slumped over in sleep. WhenLUKE 9
73
they came to, rubbing their eyes, they
saw Jesus in his glory and the two men
standing with him.
33 When Moses and Elijah had le ,
Peter said to Jesus, "Master, this is
a great moment! Let's build three
memorials: one for you, one for Moses,
and one for Elijah." He blurted this out
without thinking.
34 While he was babbling on like this,
a light-radiant cloud enveloped them.
As they found themselves buried in the
cloud, they became deeply aware of
God.
35 Then there was a voice out of the
cloud: "This is my Son, the Chosen!
Listen to him."
36 When the sound of the voice died
away, they saw Jesus there alone. They
were speechless. And they con nued
speechless, said not one thing to anyone
during those days of what they had seen.LUKE 9
74
37 When they came down oﬀ the
mountain the next day, a big crowd was
there to meet them.
38 A man called from out of the crowd,
"Please, please, Teacher, take a look at
my son. He's my only child.
39 O en a spirit seizes him. Suddenly
he's screaming, thrown into convulsions,
his mouth foaming. And then it beats
him black and blue before it leaves.
40 I asked your disciples to deliver him
but they couldn't."
41 Jesus said, "What a genera on! No
sense of God! No focus to your lives!
How many mes do I have to go over
these things? How much longer do I
have to put up with this? Bring your son
here."
42 While he was coming, the demon
slammed him to the ground and threw
him into convulsions. Jesus stepped in,LUKE 9
75
ordered the vile spirit gone, healed the
boy, and handed him back to his father.
43 They all shook their heads in
wonder, astonished at God's greatness,
God's majes c greatness. While they
con nued to stand around exclaiming
over all the things he was doing, Jesus
said to his disciples,
44 "Treasure and ponder each of these
next words: The Son of Man is about to
be betrayed into human hands."
45 They didn't get what he was saying.
It was like he was speaking a foreign
language and they couldn't make heads
or tails of it. But they were embarrassed
to ask him what he meant.
46 They started arguing over which of
them would be most famous.
47 When Jesus realized how much this
ma ered to them, he brought a child to
his side.LUKE 9
76
48 "Whoever accepts this child as if the
child were me, accepts me," he said.
"And whoever accepts me, accepts the
One who sent me. You become great by
accep ng, not asser ng. Your spirit, not
your size, makes the diﬀerence."
49 John spoke up, "Master, we saw a
man using your name to expel demons
and we stopped him because he wasn't
of our group."
50 Jesus said, "Don't stop him. If he's
not an enemy, he's an ally."
51 When it came close to the me
for his Ascension, he gathered up his
courage and steeled himself for the
journey to Jerusalem.
52 He sent messengers on ahead. They
came to a Samaritan village to make
arrangements for his hospitality.
53 But when the Samaritans learned
that his des na on was Jerusalem, they
refused hospitality.LUKE 9
77
54 When the disciples James and John
learned of it, they said, "Master, do you
want us to call a bolt of lightning down
out of the sky and incinerate them?"
55 Jesus turned on them: "Of course
not!"
56 And they traveled on to another
village.
57 On the road someone asked if
he could go along. "I'll go with you,
wherever," he said.
58 Jesus was curt: "Are you ready to
rough it? We're not staying in the best
inns, you know."
59 Jesus said to another, "Follow me."
He said, "Certainly, but ﬁrst excuse me
for a couple of days, please. I have to
make arrangements for my father's
funeral."
60 Jesus refused. "First things ﬁrst. Your
business is life, not death. And life is
urgent: Announce God's kingdom!"LUKE 9 – 10
78
61 Then another said, "I'm ready to
follow you, Master, but ﬁrst excuse me
while I get things straightened out at
home."
62 Jesus said, "No procras na on. No
backward looks. You can't put God's
kingdom oﬀ ll tomorrow. Seize the
day."
1 Later the Master selected
seventy and sent them ahead of
him in pairs to every town and place
where he intended to go.
2 He gave them this charge: "What a
huge harvest! And how few the harvest
hands. So on your knees; ask the God of
the Harvest to send harvest hands.
3 "On your way! But be careful--this is
hazardous work. You're like lambs in a
wolf pack.
4 "Travel light. Comb and toothbrush
and no extra luggage. "Don't loiter and
10LUKE 10
79
make small talk with everyone you meet
along the way.
5 "When you enter a home, greet the
family, 'Peace.'
6 If your gree ng is received, then
it's a good place to stay. But if it's not
received, take it back and get out. Don't
impose yourself.
7 "Stay at one home, taking your meals
there, for a worker deserves three
square meals. Don't move from house to
house, looking for the best cook in town.
8 "When you enter a town and are
received, eat what they set before you,
9 heal anyone who is sick, and tell
them, 'God's kingdom is right on your
doorstep!'
10 "When you enter a town and are not
received, go out in the street and say,
11 'The only thing we got from you is
the dirt on our feet, and we're giving itLUKE 10
80
back. Did you have any idea that God's
kingdom was right on your doorstep?'
12 Sodom will have it be er on
Judgment Day than the town that rejects
you.
13 "Doom, Chorazin! Doom, Bethsaida!
If Tyre and Sidon had been given half
the chances given you, they'd have been
on their knees long ago, repen ng and
crying for mercy.
14 Tyre and Sidon will have it easy on
Judgment Day compared to you.
15 "And you, Capernaum! Do you think
you're about to be promoted to heaven?
Think again. You're on a mud slide to
hell.
16 "The one who listens to you, listens
to me. The one who rejects you, rejects
me. And rejec ng me is the same as
rejec ng God, who sent me."LUKE 10
81
17 The seventy came back triumphant.
"Master, even the demons danced to
your tune!"
18 Jesus said, "I know. I saw Satan fall, a
bolt of lightning out of the sky.
19 See what I've given you? Safe passage
as you walk on snakes and scorpions,
and protec on from every assault of the
Enemy. No one can put a hand on you.
20 All the same, the great triumph is not
in your authority over evil, but in God's
authority over you and presence with
you. Not what you do for God but what
God does for you--that's the agenda for
rejoicing."
21 At that, Jesus rejoiced, exuberant
in the Holy Spirit. "I thank you, Father,
Master of heaven and earth, that you
hid these things from the know-it-alls
and showed them to these innocent
newcomers. Yes, Father, it pleased you
to do it this way.LUKE 10
82
22 "I've been given it all by my Father!
Only the Father knows who the Son is
and only the Son knows who the Father
is. The Son can introduce the Father to
anyone he wants to."
23 He then turned in a private aside to
his disciples. "Fortunate the eyes that
see what you're seeing!
24 There are plenty of prophets and
kings who would have given their right
arm to see what you are seeing but
never got so much as a glimpse, to hear
what you are hearing but never got so
much as a whisper."
25 Just then a religion scholar stood up
with a ques on to test Jesus. "Teacher,
what do I need to do to get eternal life?"
26 He answered, "What's wri en in
God's Law? How do you interpret it?"
27 He said, "That you love the Lord your
God with all your passion and prayer
and muscle and intelligence--and thatLUKE 10
83
you love your neighbor as well as you do
yourself."
28 "Good answer!" said Jesus. "Do it
and you'll live."
29 Looking for a loophole, he asked,
"And just how would you deﬁne
'neighbor'?"
30 Jesus answered by telling a story.
"There was once a man traveling from
Jerusalem to Jericho. On the way he
was a acked by robbers. They took
his clothes, beat him up, and went oﬀ
leaving him half-dead.
31 Luckily, a priest was on his way down
the same road, but when he saw him he
angled across to the other side.
32 Then a Levite religious man showed
up; he also avoided the injured man.
33 "A Samaritan traveling the road
came on him. When he saw the man's
condi on, his heart went out to him.LUKE 10
34 He gave him ﬁrst aid, disinfec
84
ng and
bandaging his wounds. Then he li ed
him onto his donkey, led him to an inn,
and made him comfortable.
35 In the morning he took out two silver
coins and gave them to the innkeeper,
saying, 'Take good care of him. If it costs
any more, put it on my bill--I'll pay you
on my way back.'
36 "What do you think? Which of the
three became a neighbor to the man
a acked by robbers?"
37 "The one who treated him kindly,"
the religion scholar responded. Jesus
said, "Go and do the same."
38 As they con nued their travel, Jesus
entered a village. A woman by the name
of Martha welcomed him and made him
feel quite at home.
39 She had a sister, Mary, who sat before
the Master, hanging on every word he
said.LUKE 10 – 11
85
40 But Martha was pulled away by all
she had to do in the kitchen. Later,
she stepped in, interrup ng them.
"Master, don't you care that my sister
has abandoned the kitchen to me? Tell
her to lend me a hand."
41 The Master said, "Martha, dear
Martha, you're fussing far too much and
ge ng yourself worked up over nothing.
42 One thing only is essen al, and Mary
has chosen it--it's the main course, and
won't be taken from her."
1 One day he was praying in a
certain place. When he ﬁnished,
one of his disciples said, "Master,
teach us to pray just as John taught his
disciples."
2 So he said, "When you pray, say,
Father, Reveal who you are. Set the
world right.
3 Keep us alive with three square meals.
11LUKE 11
86
4 Keep us forgiven with you and
forgiving others. Keep us safe from
ourselves and the Devil."
5 Then he said, "Imagine what would
happen if you went to a friend in the
middle of the night and said, 'Friend,
lend me three loaves of bread.
6 An old friend traveling through just
showed up, and I don't have a thing on
hand.'
7 "The friend answers from his bed,
'Don't bother me. The door's locked;
my children are all down for the night; I
can't get up to give you anything.'
8 "But let me tell you, even if he won't
get up because he's a friend, if you stand
your ground, knocking and waking all
the neighbors, he'll ﬁnally get up and get
you whatever you need.
9 "Here's what I'm saying: Ask and you'll
get; Seek and you'll ﬁnd; Knock and the
door will open.LUKE 11
87
10 "Don't bargain with God. Be direct.
Ask for what you need. This is not a
cat-and-mouse, hide-and-seek game
we're in.
11 If your li le boy asks for a serving of
ﬁsh, do you scare him with a live snake
on his plate?
12 If your li le girl asks for an egg, do
you trick her with a spider?
13 As bad as you are, you wouldn't think
of such a thing--you're at least decent to
your own children. And don't you think
the Father who conceived you in love
will give the Holy Spirit when you ask
him?"
14 Jesus delivered a man from a demon
that had kept him speechless. The
demon gone, the man started talking
a blue streak, taking the crowd by
complete surprise.LUKE 11
88
15 But some from the crowd were
cynical. "Black magic," they said. "Some
devil trick he's pulled from his sleeve."
16 Others were skep cal, wai ng
around for him to prove himself with a
spectacular miracle.
17 Jesus knew what they were thinking
and said, "Any country in civil war
for very long is wasted. A constantly
squabbling family falls to pieces.
18 If Satan cancels Satan, is there any
Satan le ? You accuse me of ganging up
with the Devil, the prince of demons, to
cast out demons,
19 but if you're slinging devil mud at me,
calling me a devil who kicks out devils,
doesn't the same mud s ck to your own
exorcists?
20 But if it's God's ﬁnger I'm poin ng
that sends the demons on their way,
then God's kingdom is here for sure.LUKE 11
89
21 "When a strong man, armed to the
teeth, stands guard in his front yard, his
property is safe and sound.
22 But what if a stronger man comes
along with superior weapons? Then he's
beaten at his own game, the arsenal that
gave him such conﬁdence hauled oﬀ,
and his precious possessions plundered.
23 "This is war, and there is no neutral
ground. If you're not on my side, you're
the enemy; if you're not helping, you're
making things worse.
24 "When a corrup ng spirit is expelled
from someone, it dri s along through
the desert looking for an oasis, some
unsuspec ng soul it can bedevil. When it
doesn't ﬁnd anyone, it says, 'I'll go back
to my old haunt.'
25 On return, it ﬁnds the person swept
and dusted, but vacant.
26 It then runs out and rounds up seven
other spirits dir er than itself and theyLUKE 11
90
all move in, whooping it up. That person
ends up far worse than if he'd never
go en cleaned up in the ﬁrst place."
27 While he was saying these things,
some woman li ed her voice above
the murmur of the crowd: "Blessed the
womb that carried you, and the breasts
at which you nursed!"
28 Jesus commented, "Even more
blessed are those who hear God's Word
and guard it with their lives!"
29 As the crowd swelled, he took a fresh
tack: "The mood of this age is all wrong.
Everybody's looking for proof, but you're
looking for the wrong kind. All you're
looking for is something to llate your
curiosity, sa sfy your lust for miracles.
But the only proof you're going to get is
the Jonah-proof given to the Ninevites,
which looks like no proof at all.
30 What Jonah was to Nineveh, the Son
of Man is to this age.LUKE 11
91
31 "On Judgment Day the Ninevites will
stand up and give evidence that will
condemn this genera on, because when
Jonah preached to them they changed
their lives. A far greater preacher than
Jonah is here, and you squabble about
'proofs.'
32 On Judgment Day the Queen of
Sheba will come forward and bring
evidence that condemns this genera on,
because she traveled from a far corner
of the earth to listen to wise Solomon.
Wisdom far greater than Solomon's is
right in front of you, and you quibble
over 'evidence.'
33 "No one lights a lamp, then hides it
in a drawer. It's put on a lamp stand so
those entering the room have light to
see where they're going.
34 Your eye is a lamp, ligh ng up your
whole body. If you live wide-eyed in
wonder and belief, your body ﬁlls upLUKE 11
92
with light. If you live squinty-eyed in
greed and distrust, your body is a dank
cellar.
35 Keep your eyes open, your lamp
burning, so you don't get musty and
murky.
36 Keep your life as well-lighted as your
best-lighted room."
37 When he ﬁnished that talk, a Pharisee
asked him to dinner. He entered his
house and sat right down at the table.
38 The Pharisee was shocked and
somewhat oﬀended when he saw that
Jesus didn't wash up before the meal.
39 But the Master said to him, "I know
you Pharisees burnish the surface of
your cups and plates so they sparkle in
the sun, but I also know your insides are
maggoty with greed and secret evil.
40 Stupid Pharisees! Didn't the One who
made the outside also make the inside?LUKE 11
93
41 Turn both your pockets and your
hearts inside out and give generously to
the poor; then your lives will be clean,
not just your dishes and your hands.
42 "I've had it with you! You're hopeless,
you Pharisees! Frauds! You keep
me culous account books, thing on
every nickel and dime you get, but
manage to ﬁnd loopholes for ge ng
around basic ma ers of jus ce and
God's love. Careful bookkeeping is
commendable, but the basics are
required.
43 "You're hopeless, you Pharisees!
Frauds! You love si ng at the head
table at church dinners, love preening
yourselves in the radiance of public
ﬂa ery.
44 Frauds! You're just like unmarked
graves: People walk over that nice,
grassy surface, never suspec ng the rot
and corrup on that is six feet under."LUKE 11
94
45 One of the religion scholars spoke up:
"Teacher, do you realize that in saying
these things you're insul ng us?"
46 He said, "Yes, and I can be even more
explicit. You're hopeless, you religion
scholars! You load people down with
rules and regula ons, nearly breaking
their backs, but never li even a ﬁnger
to help.
47 "You're hopeless! You build tombs for
the prophets your ancestors killed.
48 The tombs you build are monuments
to your murdering ancestors more than
to the murdered prophets.
49 That accounts for God's Wisdom
saying, 'I will send them prophets and
apostles, but they'll kill them and run
them oﬀ.'
50 What it means is that every drop of
righteous blood ever spilled from the
me earth began un l now, .LUKE 11 – 12
95
51 from the blood of Abel to the blood
of Zechariah, who was struck down
between altar and sanctuary, is on
your heads. Yes, it's on the bill of this
genera on and this genera on will pay.
52 "You're hopeless, you religion
scholars! You took the key of knowledge,
but instead of unlocking doors, you
locked them. You won't go in yourself,
and won't let anyone else in either."
53 As soon as Jesus le the table, the
religion scholars and Pharisees went
into a rage. They went over and over
everything he said,
54 plo ng how they could trap him in
something from his own mouth.
1 By this me the crowd, unwieldy
and stepping on each other's
toes, numbered into the thousands. But
Jesus' primary concern was his disciples.
He said to them, "Watch yourselves
12LUKE 12
96
carefully so you don't get contaminated
with Pharisee yeast, Pharisee phoniness.
2 You can't keep your true self hidden
forever; before long you'll be exposed.
You can't hide behind a religious mask
forever; sooner or later the mask will slip
and your true face will be known.
3 You can't whisper one thing in private
and preach the opposite in public; the
day's coming when those whispers will
be repeated all over town.
4 "I'm speaking to you as dear friends.
Don't be bluﬀed into silence or
insincerity by the threats of religious
bullies. True, they can kill you, but then
what can they do? There's nothing they
can do to your soul, your core being.
5 Save your fear for God, who holds
your en re life--body and soul--in his
hands.LUKE 12
97
6 "What's the price of two or three pet
canaries? Some loose change, right? But
God never overlooks a single one.
7 And he pays even greater a en on
to you, down to the last detail--even
numbering the hairs on your head! So
don't be in midated by all this bully
talk. You're worth more than a million
canaries.
8 "Stand up for me among the people
you meet and the Son of Man will stand
up for you before all God's angels.
9 But if you pretend you don't know me,
do you think I'll defend you before God's
angels?
10 "If you bad-mouth the Son of Man
out of misunderstanding or ignorance,
that can be overlooked. But if you're
knowingly a acking God himself, taking
aim at the Holy Spirit, that won't be
overlooked.LUKE 12
98
11 "When they drag you into their
mee ng places, or into police courts
and before judges, don't worry about
defending yourselves--what you'll say or
how you'll say it.
12 The right words will be there. The
Holy Spirit will give you the right words
when the me comes."
13 Someone out of the crowd said,
"Teacher, order my brother to give me a
fair share of the family inheritance."
14 He replied, "Mister, what makes you
think it's any of my business to be a
judge or mediator for you?"
15 Speaking to the people, he went on,
"Take care! Protect yourself against the
least bit of greed. Life is not deﬁned by
what you have, even when you have a
lot."
16 Then he told them this story: "The
farm of a certain rich man produced a
terriﬁc crop.LUKE 12
99
17 He talked to himself: 'What can I
do? My barn isn't big enough for this
harvest.'
18 Then he said, 'Here's what I'll do: I'll
tear down my barns and build bigger
ones. Then I'll gather in all my grain and
goods,
19 and I'll say to myself, Self, you've
done well! You've got it made and can
now re re. Take it easy and have the
me of your life!'
20 "Just then God showed up and said,
'Fool! Tonight you die. And your barnful
of goods--who gets it?'
21 "That's what happens when you ﬁll
your barn with Self and not with God."
22 He con nued this subject with his
disciples. "Don't fuss about what's on
the table at meal mes or if the clothes
in your closet are in fashion.
23 There is far more to your inner life
than the food you put in your stomach,LUKE 12
100
more to your outer appearance than the
clothes you hang on your body.
24 Look at the ravens, free and
unfe ered, not ed down to a job
descrip on, carefree in the care of God.
And you count far more.
25 "Has anyone by fussing before the
mirror ever go en taller by so much as
an inch?
26 If fussing can't even do that, why fuss
at all?
27 Walk into the ﬁelds and look at the
wildﬂowers. They don't fuss with their
appearance--but have you ever seen
color and design quite like it? The ten
best-dressed men and women in the
country look shabby alongside them.
28 If God gives such a en on to the
wildﬂowers, most of them never even
seen, don't you think he'll a end to you,
take pride in you, do his best for you?LUKE 12
101
29 "What I'm trying to do here is get
you to relax, not be so preoccupied with
ge ng so you can respond to God's
giving.
30 People who don't know God and the
way he works fuss over these things, but
you know both God and how he works.
31 Steep yourself in God-reality, God-
ini a ve, God-provisions. You'll ﬁnd all
your everyday human concerns will be
met.
32 Don't be afraid of missing out. You're
my dearest friends! The Father wants to
give you the very kingdom itself.
33 "Be generous. Give to the poor. Get
yourselves a bank that can't go bankrupt,
a bank in heaven far from bankrobbers,
safe from embezzlers, a bank you can
bank on.
34 It's obvious, isn't it? The place where
your treasure is, is the place you will
most want to be, and end up being.LUKE 12
102
35 "Keep your shirts on; keep the lights
on!
36 Be like house servants wai
ng for
their master to come back from his
honeymoon, awake and ready to open
the door when he arrives and knocks.
37 Lucky the servants whom the master
ﬁnds on watch! He'll put on an apron,
sit them at the table, and serve them
a meal, sharing his wedding feast with
them.
38 It doesn't ma er what me of the
night he arrives; they're awake--and so
blessed!
39 "You know that if the house owner
had known what night the burglar was
coming, he wouldn't have stayed out
late and le the place unlocked.
40 So don't you be slovenly and careless.
Just when you don't expect him, the Son
of Man will show up."LUKE 12
103
41 Peter said, "Master, are you telling
this story just for us? Or is it for
everybody?"
42 The Master said, "Let me ask you:
Who is the dependable manager, full of
common sense, that the master puts in
charge of his staﬀ to feed them well and
on me?
43 He is a blessed man if when the
master shows up he's doing his job.
45 But if he says to himself, 'The master
is certainly taking his me,' begins
maltrea ng the servants and maids,
throws par es for his friends, and gets
drunk,
46 the master will walk in when he least
expects it, give him the thrashing of his
life, and put him back in the kitchen
peeling potatoes.
47 "The servant who knows what
his master wants and ignores it, orLUKE 12
104
insolently does whatever he pleases, will
be thoroughly thrashed.
48 But if he does a poor job through
ignorance, he'll get oﬀ with a slap
on the hand. Great gi s mean great
responsibili es; greater gi s, greater
responsibili es!
49 "I've come to start a ﬁre on this
earth--how I wish it were blazing right
now!
50 I've come to change everything, turn
everything rightside up--how I long for it
to be ﬁnished!
51 Do you think I came to smooth things
over and make everything nice? Not so.
I've come to disrupt and confront!
52 From now on, when you ﬁnd ﬁve in a
house, it will be--Three against two, and
two against three;
53 Father against son, and son against
father; Mother against daughter, and
daughter against mother; Mother-in-LUKE 12
105
law against bride, and bride against
mother-in-law."
54 Then he turned to the crowd: "When
you see clouds coming in from the west,
you say, 'Storm's coming'--and you're
right.
55 And when the wind comes out of the
south, you say, 'This'll be a hot one'--and
you're right.
56 Frauds! You know how to tell a
change in the weather, so don't tell me
you can't tell a change in the season, the
God-season we're in right now.
57 "You don't have to be a genius to
understand these things. Just use your
common sense,
58 the kind you'd use if, while being
taken to court, you decided to se le up
with your accuser on the way, knowing
that if the case went to the judge you'd
probably go to jailLUKE 12 – 13
106
59 and pay every last penny of the ﬁne.
That's the kind of decision I'm asking you
to make."
1 About that me some people
came up and told him about the
Galileans Pilate had killed while they
were at worship, mixing their blood with
the blood of the sacriﬁces on the altar.
2 Jesus responded, "Do you think those
murdered Galileans were worse sinners
than all other Galileans?
3 Not at all. Unless you turn to God, you
too will die.
4 And those eighteen in Jerusalem the
other day, the ones crushed and killed
when the Tower of Siloam collapsed
and fell on them, do you think they
were worse ci zens than all other
Jerusalemites?
5 Not at all. Unless you turn to God, you
too will die."
13LUKE 13
107
6 Then he told them a story: "A man
had an apple tree planted in his front
yard. He came to it expec ng to ﬁnd
apples, but there weren't any.
7 He said to his gardener, 'What's going
on here? For three years now I've come
to this tree expec ng apples and not one
apple have I found. Chop it down! Why
waste good ground with it any longer?'
8 "The gardener said, 'Let's give it
another year. I'll dig around it and
fer lize,
9 and maybe it will produce next year; if
it doesn't, then chop it down.'"
10 He was teaching in one of the
mee ng places on the Sabbath.
11 There was a woman present, so
twisted and bent over with arthri s that
she couldn't even look up. She had been
aﬄicted with this for eighteen years.
12 When Jesus saw her, he called her
over. "Woman, you're free!"LUKE 13
108
13 He laid hands on her and suddenly
she was standing straight and tall, giving
glory to God.
14 The mee ng-place president, furious
because Jesus had healed on the
Sabbath, said to the congrega on, "Six
days have been deﬁned as work days.
Come on one of the six if you want to
be healed, but not on the seventh, the
Sabbath."
15 But Jesus shot back, "You frauds!
Each Sabbath every one of you regularly
un es your cow or donkey from its stall,
leads it out for water, and thinks nothing
of it.
16 So why isn't it all right for me to un e
this daughter of Abraham and lead her
from the stall where Satan has had her
ed these eighteen years?"
17 When he put it that way, his cri cs
were le looking quite silly and red-LUKE 13
109
faced. The congrega on was delighted
and cheered him on.
18 Then he said, "How can I picture
God's kingdom for you? What kind of
story can I use?
19 It's like a pine nut that a man plants
in his front yard. It grows into a huge
pine tree with thick branches, and eagles
build nests in it."
20 He tried again. "How can I picture
God's kingdom?
21 It's like yeast that a woman works
into enough dough for three loaves of
bread--and waits while the dough rises."
22 He went on teaching from town to
village, village to town, but keeping on a
steady course toward Jerusalem.
23 A bystander said, "Master, will only a
few be saved?" He said,
24 "Whether few or many is none
of your business. Put your mind on
your life with God. The way to life--toLUKE 13
110
God!--is vigorous and requires your
total a en on. A lot of you are going
to assume that you'll sit down to God's
salva on banquet just because you've
been hanging around the neighborhood
all your lives.
25 Well, one day you're going to be
banging on the door, wan ng to get in,
but you'll ﬁnd the door locked and the
Master saying, 'Sorry, you're not on my
guest list.'
26 "You'll protest, 'But we've known you
all our lives!'
27 only to be interrupted with his
abrupt, 'Your kind of knowing can hardly
be called knowing. You don't know the
ﬁrst thing about me.'
28 "That's when you'll ﬁnd yourselves
out in the cold, strangers to grace. You'll
watch Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets march into God's kingdom.LUKE 13
111
29 You'll watch outsiders stream in from
east, west, north, and south and sit
down at the table of God's kingdom.
And all the me you'll be outside looking
in--and wondering what happened.
30 This is the Great Reversal: the last in
line put at the head of the line, and the
so-called ﬁrst ending up last.
31 Just then some Pharisees came up
and said, "Run for your life! Herod's on
the hunt. He's out to kill you!"
32 Jesus said, "Tell that fox that I've
no me for him right now. Today and
tomorrow I'm busy clearing out the
demons and healing the sick; the third
day I'm wrapping things up.
33 Besides, it's not proper for a prophet
to come to a bad end outside Jerusalem.
34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killer of
prophets, abuser of the messengers of
God! How o en I've longed to gather
your children, gather your childrenLUKE 13 – 14
112
like a hen, Her brood safe under her
wings--but you refused and turned
away!
35 And now it's too late: You won't see
me again un l the day you say, 'Blessed
is he who comes in the name of God.'"
1 One me when Jesus went for a
Sabbath meal with one of the top
leaders of the Pharisees, all the guests
had their eyes on him, watching his
every move.
2 Right before him there was a man
hugely swollen in his joints.
3 So Jesus asked the religion scholars
and Pharisees present, "Is it permi ed
to heal on the Sabbath? Yes or no?"
4 They were silent. So he took the man,
healed him, and sent him on his way.
5 Then he said, "Is there anyone here
who, if a child or animal fell down a
well, wouldn't rush to pull him out
14LUKE 14
113
immediately, not asking whether or not
it was the Sabbath?"
6 They were stumped. There was
nothing they could say to that.
7 He went on to tell a story to the guests
around the table. No cing how each had
tried to elbow into the place of honor,
he said,
8 "When someone invites you to dinner,
don't take the place of honor. Somebody
more important than you might have
been invited by the host.
9 Then he'll come and call out in front
of everybody, 'You're in the wrong place.
The place of honor belongs to this man.'
Red-faced, you'll have to make your way
to the very last table, the only place le .
10 "When you're invited to dinner, go
and sit at the last place. Then when the
host comes he may very well say, 'Friend,
come up to the front.' That will give the
dinner guests something to talk about!LUKE 14
114
11 What I'm saying is, If you walk around
with your nose in the air, you're going
to end up ﬂat on your face. But if you're
content to be simply yourself, you will
become more than yourself."
12 Then he turned to the host. "The
next me you put on a dinner, don't just
invite your friends and family and rich
neighbors, the kind of people who will
return the favor.
13 Invite some people who never get
invited out, the misﬁts from the wrong
side of the tracks.
14 You'll be--and experience--a blessing.
They won't be able to return the favor,
but the favor will be returned--oh, how
it will be returned!--at the resurrec on
of God's people."
15 That triggered a response from
one of the guests: "How fortunate the
one who gets to eat dinner in God's
kingdom!"LUKE 14
115
16 Jesus followed up. "Yes. For there
was once a man who threw a great
dinner party and invited many.
17 When it was me for dinner, he sent
out his servant to the invited guests,
saying, 'Come on in; the food's on the
table.'
18 "Then they all began to beg oﬀ, one
a er another making excuses. The ﬁrst
said, 'I bought a piece of property and
need to look it over. Send my regrets.'
19 "Another said, 'I just bought ﬁve
teams of oxen, and I really need to check
them out. Send my regrets.'
20 "And yet another said, 'I just got
married and need to get home to my
wife.'
21 "The servant went back and told
the master what had happened. He
was outraged and told the servant,
'Quickly, get out into the city streets
and alleys. Collect all who look like theyLUKE 14
116
need a square meal, all the misﬁts and
homeless and wretched you can lay your
hands on, and bring them here.'
22 "The servant reported back, 'Master,
I did what you commanded--and there's
s ll room.'
23 "The master said, 'Then go to the
country roads. Whoever you ﬁnd, drag
them in. I want my house full!
24 Let me tell you, not one of those
originally invited is going to get so much
as a bite at my dinner party.'"
25 One day when large groups of people
were walking along with him, Jesus
turned and told them,
26 "Anyone who comes to me but
refuses to let go of father, mother,
spouse, children, brothers, sisters--yes,
even one's own self!--can't be my
disciple.LUKE 14
117
27 Anyone who won't shoulder his own
cross and follow behind me can't be my
disciple.
28 "Is there anyone here who, planning
to build a new house, doesn't ﬁrst sit
down and ﬁgure the cost so you'll know
if you can complete it?
29 If you only get the founda on laid
and then run out of money, you're going
to look pre y foolish. Everyone passing
by will poke fun at you:
30 'He started something he couldn't
ﬁnish.'
31 "Or can you imagine a king going into
ba le against another king without ﬁrst
deciding whether it is possible with his
ten thousand troops to face the twenty
thousand troops of the other?
32 And if he decides he can't, won't he
send an emissary and work out a truce?
33 "Simply put, if you're not willing to
take what is dearest to you, whetherLUKE 14 – 15
118
plans or people, and kiss it good-bye,
you can't be my disciple.
34 "Salt is excellent. But if the salt goes
ﬂat, it's useless, good for nothing.
35 "Are you listening to this? Really
listening?"
1 By this me a lot of men and
women of doub ul reputa on
were hanging around Jesus, listening
intently.
2 The Pharisees and religion scholars
were not pleased, not at all pleased.
They growled, "He takes in sinners and
eats meals with them, trea ng them like
old friends."
3 Their grumbling triggered this story.
4 "Suppose one of you had a hundred
sheep and lost one. Wouldn't you leave
the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go
a er the lost one un l you found it?
15LUKE 15
119
5 When found, you can be sure you
would put it across your shoulders,
rejoicing,
6 and when you got home call in your
friends and neighbors, saying, 'Celebrate
with me! I've found my lost sheep!'
7 Count on it--there's more joy in
heaven over one sinner's rescued life
than over ninety-nine good people in no
need of rescue.
8 "Or imagine a woman who has ten
coins and loses one. Won't she light a
lamp and scour the house, looking in
every nook and cranny un l she ﬁnds it?
9 And when she ﬁnds it you can be sure
she'll call her friends and neighbors:
'Celebrate with me! I found my lost coin!'
10 Count on it--that's the kind of party
God's angels throw every me one lost
soul turns to God."
11 Then he said, "There was once a man
who had two sons.LUKE 15
120
12 The younger said to his father,
'Father, I want right now what's coming
to me.' "So the father divided the
property between them.
13 It wasn't long before the younger
son packed his bags and le for a
distant country. There, undisciplined and
dissipated, he wasted everything he had.
14 A er he had gone through all his
money, there was a bad famine all
through that country and he began to
hurt.
15 He signed on with a ci zen there who
assigned him to his ﬁelds to slop the
pigs.
16 He was so hungry he would have
eaten the corncobs in the pig slop, but
no one would give him any.
17 "That brought him to his senses. He
said, 'All those farmhands working for
my father sit down to three meals a day,
and here I am starving to death.LUKE 15
121
18 I'm going back to my father. I'll say to
him, Father, I've sinned against God, I've
sinned before you;
19 I don't deserve to be called your son.
Take me on as a hired hand.'
20 He got right up and went home to his
father. "When he was s ll a long way oﬀ,
his father saw him. His heart pounding,
he ran out, embraced him, and kissed
him.
21 The son started his speech: 'Father,
I've sinned against God, I've sinned
before you; I don't deserve to be called
your son ever again.'
22 "But the father wasn't listening. He
was calling to the servants, 'Quick. Bring
a clean set of clothes and dress him. Put
the family ring on his ﬁnger and sandals
on his feet.
23 Then get a grain-fed heifer and roast
it. We're going to feast! We're going to
have a wonderful me!LUKE 15
122
24 My son is here--given up for dead
and now alive! Given up for lost and
now found!' And they began to have a
wonderful me.
25 "All this me his older son was out
in the ﬁeld. When the day's work was
done he came in. As he approached the
house, he heard the music and dancing.
26 Calling over one of the houseboys,
he asked what was going on.
27 He told him, 'Your brother came
home. Your father has ordered a
feast--barbecued beef!--because he has
him home safe and sound.'
28 "The older brother stalked oﬀ in an
angry sulk and refused to join in. His
father came out and tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen.
29 The son said, 'Look how many years
I've stayed here serving you, never giving
you one moment of grief, but have youLUKE 15 – 16
123
ever thrown a party for me and my
friends?
30 Then this son of yours who has
thrown away your money on whores
shows up and you go all out with a feast!'
31 "His father said, 'Son, you don't
understand. You're with me all the me,
and everything that is mine is yours--
32 but this is a wonderful me, and we
had to celebrate. This brother of yours
was dead, and he's alive! He was lost,
and he's found!'"
1 Jesus said to his disciples,
"There was once a rich man who
had a manager. He got reports that the
manager had been taking advantage of
his posi on by running up huge personal
expenses.
2 So he called him in and said, 'What's
this I hear about you? You're ﬁred. And I
want a complete audit of your books.'
16LUKE 16
124
3 "The manager said to himself, 'What
am I going to do? I've lost my job as
manager. I'm not strong enough for a
laboring job, and I'm too proud to beg. ...
4 Ah, I've got a plan. Here's what I'll
do...then when I'm turned out into the
street, people will take me into their
houses.'
5 "Then he went at it. One a er another,
he called in the people who were in debt
to his master. He said to the ﬁrst, 'How
much do you owe my master?'
6 "He replied, 'A hundred jugs of olive
oil.' "The manager said, 'Here, take your
bill, sit down here--quick now--write
ﬁ y.'
7 "To the next he said, 'And you, what
do you owe?' "He answered, 'A hundred
sacks of wheat.' "He said, 'Take your bill,
write in eighty.'
8 "Now here's a surprise: The master
praised the crooked manager! And why?LUKE 16
125
Because he knew how to look a er
himself. Streetwise people are smarter
in this regard than law-abiding ci zens.
They are on constant alert, looking for
angles, surviving by their wits.
9 I want you to be smart in the same
way--but for what is right--using every
adversity to s mulate you to crea ve
survival, to concentrate your a en on
on the bare essen als, so you'll live,
really live, and not complacently just get
by on good behavior."
10 Jesus went on to make these
comments: If you're honest in small
things, you'll be honest in big things;
11 If you're a crook in small things, you'll
be a crook in big things.
12 If you're not honest in small jobs,
who will put you in charge of the store?
13 No worker can serve two bosses:
He'll either hate the ﬁrst and love the
second Or adore the ﬁrst and despiseLUKE 16
126
the second. You can't serve both God
and the Bank.
14 When the Pharisees, a money-
obsessed bunch, heard him say these
things, they rolled their eyes, dismissing
him as hopelessly out of touch.
15 So Jesus spoke to them: "You are
masters at making yourselves look good
in front of others, but God knows what's
behind the appearance. What society
sees and calls monumental, God sees
through and calls monstrous.
16 God's Law and the Prophets climaxed
in John; Now it's all kingdom of God--the
glad news and compelling invita on to
every man and woman.
17 The sky will disintegrate and the
earth dissolve before a single le er of
God's Law wears out.
18 Using the legali es of divorce as

19 "There once was a rich man,
expensively dressed in the latest
fashions, was ng his days in conspicuous
consump on.
20 A poor man named Lazarus, covered
with sores, had been dumped on his
doorstep.
21 All he lived for was to get a meal
from scraps oﬀ the rich man's table. His
best friends were the dogs who came
and licked his sores.
22 "Then he died, this poor man, and
was taken up by the angels to the lap of
Abraham. The rich man also died and
was buried.
23 In hell and in torment, he looked up
and saw Abraham in the distance and
Lazarus in his lap.
24 He called out, 'Father Abraham,
mercy! Have mercy! Send Lazarus to dipLUKE 16
128
his ﬁnger in water to cool my tongue. I'm
in agony in this ﬁre.'
25 "But Abraham said, 'Child, remember
that in your life me you got the good
things and Lazarus the bad things. It's
not like that here. Here he's consoled
and you're tormented.
26 Besides, in all these ma ers there is
a huge chasm set between us so that
no one can go from us to you even if he
wanted to, nor can anyone cross over
from you to us.'
27 "The rich man said, 'Then let me ask
you, Father: Send him to the house of
my father
28 where I have ﬁve brothers, so he can
tell them the score and warn them so
they won't end up here in this place of
torment.'
29 "Abraham answered, 'They have
Moses and the Prophets to tell them the
score. Let them listen to them.'LUKE 16 – 17
129
30 "'I know, Father Abraham,' he said,
'but they're not listening. If someone
came back to them from the dead, they
would change their ways.'
31 "Abraham replied, 'If they won't
listen to Moses and the Prophets, they're
not going to be convinced by someone
who rises from the dead.'"
1 He said to his disciples, "Hard
trials and tempta ons are bound
to come, but too bad for whoever brings
them on!
2 Be er to wear a millstone necklace
and take a swim in the deep blue sea
than give even one of these dear li le
ones a hard me!
3 "Be alert. If you see your friend going
wrong, correct him. If he responds,
forgive him.
4 Even if it's personal against you and
repeated seven mes through the day,
17LUKE 17
130
and seven mes he says, 'I'm sorry, I
won't do it again,' forgive him."
5 The apostles came up and said to the
Master, "Give us more faith."
6 But the Master said, "You don't need
more faith. There is no 'more' or 'less' in
faith. If you have a bare kernel of faith,
say the size of a poppy seed, you could
say to this sycamore tree, 'Go jump in
the lake,' and it would do it.
7 "Suppose one of you has a servant
who comes in from plowing the ﬁeld or
tending the sheep. Would you take his
coat, set the table, and say, 'Sit down
and eat'?
8 Wouldn't you be more likely to say,
'Prepare dinner; change your clothes
and wait table for me un l I've ﬁnished
my coﬀee; then go to the kitchen and
have your supper'?
9 Does the servant get special thanks
for doing what's expected of him?LUKE 17
131
10 It's the same with you. When you've
done everything expected of you, be
ma er-of-fact and say, 'The work is
done. What we were told to do, we did.'"
11 It happened that as he made his way
toward Jerusalem, he crossed over the
border between Samaria and Galilee.
12 As he entered a village, ten men, all
lepers, met him. They kept their distance
13 but raised their voices, calling out,
"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
14 Taking a good look at them, he said,
"Go, show yourselves to the priests."
They went, and while s ll on their way,
became clean.
15 One of them, when he realized that
he was healed, turned around and came
back, shou ng his gra tude, glorifying
God.
16 He kneeled at Jesus' feet, so grateful.
He couldn't thank him enough--and he
was a Samaritan.LUKE 17
132
17 Jesus said, "Were not ten healed?
Where are the nine?
18 Can none be found to come back and
give glory to God except this outsider?"
19 Then he said to him, "Get up. On your
way. Your faith has healed and saved
you."
20 Jesus, grilled by the Pharisees on
when the kingdom of God would come,
answered, "The kingdom of God doesn't
come by coun ng the days on the
calendar.
21 Nor when someone says, 'Look here!'
or, 'There it is!' And why? Because God's
kingdom is already among you."
22 He went on to say to his disciples,
"The days are coming when you are
going to be desperately homesick for
just a glimpse of one of the days of the
Son of Man, and you won't see a thing.LUKE 17
133
23 And they'll say to you, 'Look over
there!' or, 'Look here!' Don't fall for any
of that nonsense.
24 The arrival of the Son of Man is not
something you go out to see. He simply
comes. "You know how the whole sky
lights up from a single ﬂash of lightning?
That's how it will be on the Day of the
Son of Man.
25 But ﬁrst it's necessary that he suﬀer
many things and be turned down by the
people of today.
26 "The me of the Son of Man will be
just like the me of Noah--
27 everyone carrying on as usual,
having a good me right up to the day
Noah boarded the ship. They suspected
nothing un l the ﬂood hit and swept
everything away.
28 "It was the same in the me of
Lot--the people carrying on, having a
good me, business as usualLUKE 17
134
29 right up to the day Lot walked out of
Sodom and a ﬁrestorm swept down and
burned everything to a crisp.
30 That's how it will be--sudden,
total--when the Son of Man is revealed.
31 "When the Day arrives and you're
out working in the yard, don't run into
the house to get anything. And if you're
out in the ﬁeld, don't go back and get
your coat.
32 Remember what happened to Lot's
wife!
33 If you grasp and cling to life on your
terms, you'll lose it, but if you let that life
go, you'll get life on God's terms.
34 "On that Day, two men will be in the
same boat ﬁshing--one taken, the other
le .
35 Two women will be working in the
same kitchen--one taken, the other le ."
37 Trying to take all this in, the disciples
said, "Master, where?" He told them,LUKE 18
135
"Watch for the circling of the vultures.
They'll spot the corpse ﬁrst. The ac on
will begin around my dead body."
1 Jesus told them a story showing
that it was necessary for them to
pray consistently and never quit.
2 He said, "There was once a judge in
some city who never gave God a thought
and cared nothing for people.
3 A widow in that city kept a er him:
'My rights are being violated. Protect
me!'
4 "He never gave her the me of day.
But a er this went on and on he said to
himself, 'I care nothing what God thinks,
even less what people think.
5 But because this widow won't quit
badgering me, I'd be er do something
and see that she gets jus ce--otherwise
I'm going to end up beaten black and
blue by her pounding.'"
18LUKE 18
136
6 Then the Master said, "Do you hear
what that judge, corrupt as he is, is
saying?
7 So what makes you think God won't
step in and work jus ce for his chosen
people, who con nue to cry out for
help? Won't he s ck up for them?
8 I assure you, he will. He will not drag
his feet. But how much of that kind of
persistent faith will the Son of Man ﬁnd
on the earth when he returns?"
9 He told his next story to some
who were complacently pleased
with themselves over their moral
performance and looked down their
noses at the common people:
10 "Two men went up to the Temple
to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax
man.
11 The Pharisee posed and prayed like
this: 'Oh, God, I thank you that I am
not like other people--robbers, crooks,LUKE 18
137
adulterers, or, heaven forbid, like this tax
man.
12 I fast twice a week and the on all my
income.'
13 "Meanwhile the tax man, slumped in
the shadows, his face in his hands, not
daring to look up, said, 'God, give mercy.
Forgive me, a sinner.'"
14 Jesus commented, "This tax man, not
the other, went home made right with
God. If you walk around with your nose
in the air, you're going to end up ﬂat on
your face, but if you're content to be
simply yourself, you will become more
than yourself."
15 People brought babies to Jesus,
hoping he might touch them. When the
disciples saw it, they shooed them oﬀ.
16 Jesus called them back. "Let these
children alone. Don't get between
them and me. These children are the
kingdom's pride and joy.LUKE 18
138
17 Mark this: Unless you accept God's
kingdom in the simplicity of a child,
you'll never get in."
18 One day one of the local oﬃcials
asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I
do to deserve eternal life?"
19 Jesus said, "Why are you calling me
good? No one is good--only God.
20 You know the commandments, don't
you? No illicit sex, no killing, no stealing,
no lying, honor your father and mother."
21 He said, "I've kept them all for as long
as I can remember."
22 When Jesus heard that, he said,
"Then there's only one thing le to
do: Sell everything you own and give it
away to the poor. You will have riches in
heaven. Then come, follow me."
23 This was the last thing the oﬃcial
expected to hear. He was very rich and
became terribly sad. He was holding onLUKE 18
139
ght to a lot of things and not about to
let them go.
24 Seeing his reac on, Jesus said, "Do
you have any idea how diﬃcult it is for
people who have it all to enter God's
kingdom?
25 I'd say it's easier to thread a camel
through a needle's eye than get a rich
person into God's kingdom."
26 "Then who has any chance at all?"
the others asked.
27 "No chance at all," Jesus said, "if you
think you can pull it oﬀ by yourself. Every
chance in the world if you trust God to
do it."
28 Peter tried to regain some ini a ve:
"We le everything we owned and
followed you, didn't we?"
29 "Yes," said Jesus, "and you won't
regret it. No one who has sacriﬁced
home, spouse, brothers and sisters,
parents, children--whatever--LUKE 18
140
30 will lose out. It will all come back
mul plied many mes over in your
life me. And then the bonus of eternal
life!"
31 Then Jesus took the Twelve oﬀ to the
side and said, "Listen carefully. We're
on our way up to Jerusalem. Everything
wri en in the Prophets about the Son of
Man will take place.
32 He will be handed over to the
Romans, jeered at, made sport of, and
spit on. Then, a er giving him the third
degree, they will kill him.
33 In three days he will rise, alive."
34 But they didn't get it, could make
neither heads nor tails of what he was
talking about.
35 He came to the outskirts of Jericho.
A blind man was si ng beside the road
asking for handouts.
36 When he heard the rustle of the
crowd, he asked what was going on.LUKE 18 – 19
141
37 They told him, "Jesus the Nazarene is
going by."
38 He yelled, "Jesus! Son of David!
Mercy, have mercy on me!"
39 Those ahead of Jesus told the man to
shut up, but he only yelled all the louder,
"Son of David! Mercy, have mercy on
me!"
40 Jesus stopped and ordered him to be
brought over. When he had come near,
Jesus asked,
41 "What do you want from me?" He
said, "Master, I want to see again."
42 Jesus said, "Go ahead--see again!
Your faith has saved and healed you!"
43 The healing was instant: He looked
up, seeing--and then followed Jesus,
glorifying God. Everyone in the street
joined in, shou ng praise to God.
1 Then Jesus entered and walked
through Jericho.
19LUKE 19
142
2 There was a man there, his name
Zacchaeus, the head tax man and quite
rich.
3 He wanted desperately to see Jesus,
but the crowd was in his way--he was
a short man and couldn't see over the
crowd.
4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up in
a sycamore tree so he could see Jesus
when he came by.
5 When Jesus got to the tree, he looked
up and said, "Zacchaeus, hurry down.
Today is my day to be a guest in your
home."
6 Zacchaeus scrambled out of the tree,
hardly believing his good luck, delighted
to take Jesus home with him.
7 Everyone who saw the incident was
indignant and grumped, "What business
does he have ge ng cozy with this
crook?"LUKE 19
8 Zacchaeus just stood there, a li
143
le
stunned. He stammered apologe cally,
"Master, I give away half my income to
the poor--and if I'm caught chea ng, I
pay four mes the damages."
9 Jesus said, "Today is salva on day in
this home! Here he is: Zacchaeus, son of
Abraham!
10 For the Son of Man came to ﬁnd and
restore the lost."
11 While he had their a en on, and
because they were ge ng close to
Jerusalem by this me and expecta on
was building that God's kingdom would
appear any minute, he told this story:
12 "There was once a man descended
from a royal house who needed to make
a long trip back to headquarters to
get authoriza on for his rule and then
return.
13 But ﬁrst he called ten servants
together, gave them each a sum ofLUKE 19
144
money, and instructed them, 'Operate
with this un l I return.'
14 "But the ci zens there hated him. So
they sent a commission with a signed
pe on to oppose his rule: 'We don't
want this man to rule us.'
15 "When he came back bringing the
authoriza on of his rule, he called those
ten servants to whom he had given the
money to ﬁnd out how they had done.
16 "The ﬁrst said, 'Master, I doubled
your money.'
17 "He said, 'Good servant! Great work!
Because you've been trustworthy in this
small job, I'm making you governor of
ten towns.'
18 "The second said, 'Master, I made a
ﬁ y percent proﬁt on your money.'
19 "He said, 'I'm pu ng you in charge of
ﬁve towns.'LUKE 19
145
20 "The next servant said, 'Master,
here's your money safe and sound. I kept
it hidden in the cellar.
21 To tell you the truth, I was a li le
afraid. I know you have high standards
and hate sloppiness, and don't suﬀer
fools gladly.'
22 "He said, 'You're right that I don't
suﬀer fools gladly--and you've acted the
fool!
23 Why didn't you at least invest the
money in securi es so I would have
go en a li le interest on it?'
24 "Then he said to those standing
there, 'Take the money from him and
give it to the servant who doubled my
stake.'
25 "They said, 'But Master, he already
has double...'
26 "He said, 'That's what I mean: Risk
your life and get more than you everLUKE 19
146
dreamed of. Play it safe and end up
holding the bag.
27 "'As for these enemies of mine who
pe oned against my rule, clear them
out of here. I don't want to see their
faces around here again.'"
28 A er saying these things, Jesus
headed straight up to Jerusalem.
29 When he got near Bethphage and
Bethany at the mountain called Olives,
he sent oﬀ two of the disciples with
instruc ons:
30 "Go to the village across from you.
As soon as you enter, you'll ﬁnd a colt
tethered, one that has never been
ridden. Un e it and bring it.
31 If anyone says anything, asks, 'What
are you doing?' say, 'His Master needs
him.'"
32 The two le and found it just as he
said.LUKE 19
147
33 As they were untying the colt, its
owners said, "What are you doing
untying the colt?"
34 They said, "His Master needs him."
35 They brought the colt to Jesus. Then,
throwing their coats on its back, they
helped Jesus get on.
36 As he rode, the people gave him a
grand welcome, throwing their coats on
the street.
37 Right at the crest, where Mount
Olives begins its descent, the whole
crowd of disciples burst into enthusias c
praise over all the mighty works they
had witnessed:
38 Blessed is he who comes, the king in
God's name! All's well in heaven! Glory
in the high places!
39 Some Pharisees from the crowd told
him, "Teacher, get your disciples under
control!"LUKE 19
148
40 But he said, "If they kept quiet, the
stones would do it for them, shou ng
praise."
41 When the city came into view, he
wept over it.
42 "If you had only recognized this day,
and everything that was good for you!
But now it's too late.
43 In the days ahead your enemies are
going to bring up their heavy ar llery
and surround you, pressing in from every
side.
44 They'll smash you and your babies
on the pavement. Not one stone will be
le intact. All this because you didn't
recognize and welcome God's personal
visit."
45 Going into the Temple he began to
throw out everyone who had set up
shop, selling everything and anything.LUKE 19 – 20
46 He said, "It's wri
149
en in Scripture, My
house is a house of prayer; You have
turned it into a religious bazaar."
47 From then on he taught each day in
the Temple. The high priests, religion
scholars, and the leaders of the people
were trying their best to ﬁnd a way to
get rid of him.
48 But with the people hanging on every
word he spoke, they couldn't come up
with anything.
1 One day he was teaching the
people in the Temple, proclaiming
the Message. The high priests, religion
scholars, and leaders confronted
2 him and demanded, "Show us your
creden als. Who authorized you to
speak and act like this?"
3 Jesus answered, "First, let me ask you
a ques on:
4 About the bap sm of John--who
authorized it, heaven or humans?"
20LUKE 20
150
5 They were on the spot, and knew
it. They pulled back into a huddle and
whispered, "If we say 'heaven,' he'll ask
us why we didn't believe him;
6 if we say 'humans,' the people will
tear us limb from limb, convinced as
they are that John was God's prophet."
7 They agreed to concede that round to
Jesus and said they didn't know.
8 Jesus said, "Then neither will I answer
your ques on."
9 Jesus told another story to the people:
"A man planted a vineyard. He handed
it over to farmhands and went oﬀ on a
trip. He was gone a long me.
10 In me he sent a servant back to
the farmhands to collect the proﬁts,
but they beat him up and sent him oﬀ
empty-handed.
11 He decided to try again and sent
another servant. That one they beatLUKE 20
151
black and blue, and sent him oﬀ
empty-handed.
12 He tried a third me. They worked
that servant over from head to foot and
dumped him in the street.
13 "Then the owner of the vineyard said,
'I know what I'll do: I'll send my beloved
son. They're bound to respect my son.'
14 "But when the farmhands saw him
coming, they quickly put their heads
together. 'This is our chance--this is the
heir! Let's kill him and have it all to
ourselves.'
15 They killed him and threw him over
the fence. "What do you think the owner
of the vineyard will do?
16 Right. He'll come and clean house.
Then he'll assign the care of the vineyard
to others." Those who were listening
said, "Oh, no! He'd never do that!"
17 But Jesus didn't back down. "Why,
then, do you think this was wri en: ThatLUKE 20
152
stone the masons threw out--It's now
the cornerstone!?
18 "Anyone falling over that stone will
break every bone in his body; if the
stone falls on anyone, it will be a total
smashup."
19 The religion scholars and high priests
wanted to lynch him on the spot, but
they were in midated by public opinion.
They knew the story was about them.
20 Watching for a chance to get him,
they sent spies who posed as honest
inquirers, hoping to trick him into saying
something that would get him in trouble
with the law.
21 So they asked him, "Teacher, we know
that you're honest and straigh orward
when you teach, that you don't pander
to anyone but teach the way of God
accurately.
22 Tell us: Is it lawful to pay taxes to
Caesar or not?"LUKE 20
153
23 He knew they were laying for him
and said,
24 "Show me a coin. Now, this engraving,
who does it look like and what does it
say?"
25 "Caesar," they said. Jesus said, "Then
give Caesar what is his and give God
what is his."
26 Try as they might, they couldn't trap
him into saying anything incrimina ng.
His answer caught them oﬀ guard and
le them speechless.
27 Some Sadducees came up. This is the
Jewish party that denies any possibility
of resurrec on. They asked,
28 "Teacher, Moses wrote us that if
a man dies and leaves a wife but no
child, his brother is obligated to take the
widow to wife and get her with child.
29 Well, there once were seven
brothers. The ﬁrst took a wife. He died
childless.LUKE 20
154
30 The second married her and died,
31 then the third, and eventually all
seven had their turn, but no child.
32 A er all that, the wife died.
33 That wife, now--in the resurrec on
whose wife is she? All seven married
her."
34 Jesus said, "Marriage is a major
preoccupa on here,
35 but not there. Those who are
included in the resurrec on of the
dead will no longer be concerned with
marriage
36 nor, of course, with death. They
will have be er things to think about,
if you can believe it. All ecstasies and
in macies then will be with God.
37 Even Moses exclaimed about
resurrec on at the burning bush, saying,
'God: God of Abraham, God of Isaac,
God of Jacob!'LUKE 20
155
38 God isn't the God of dead men, but
of the living. To him all are alive."
39 Some of the religion scholars said,
"Teacher, that's a great answer!"
40 For a while, anyway, no one dared
put ques ons to him.
41 Then he put a ques on to them:
"How is it that they say that the Messiah
is David's son?
42 In the Book of Psalms, David clearly
says, God said to my Master, "Sit here at
my right hand
43 un l I put your enemies under your
feet."
44 "David here designates the Messiah
as 'my Master'--so how can the Messiah
also be his 'son'?"
45 With everybody listening, Jesus
spoke to his disciples.
46 "Watch out for the religion scholars.
They love to walk around in academic
gowns, preen in the radiance of publicLUKE 20 – 21
156
ﬂa ery, bask in prominent posi ons,
sit at the head table at every church
func on.
47 And all the me they are exploi ng
the weak and helpless. The longer their
prayers, the worse they get. But they'll
pay for it in the end."
1 Just then he looked up and
saw the rich people dropping
oﬀerings in the collec on plate.
2 Then he saw a poor widow put in two
pennies.
3 He said, "The plain truth is that this
widow has given by far the largest
oﬀering today.
4 All these others made oﬀerings that
they'll never miss; she gave extravagantly
what she couldn't aﬀord--she gave her
all!"
5 One day people were standing around
talking about the Temple, remarking
how beau ful it was, the splendor of
21LUKE 21
157
its stonework and memorial gi s. Jesus
said,
6 "All this you're admiring so much--the
me is coming when every stone in that
building will end up in a heap of rubble."
7 They asked him, "Teacher, when is this
going to happen? What clue will we get
that it's about to take place?"
8 He said, "Watch out for the doomsday
deceivers. Many leaders are going to
show up with forged iden es claiming,
'I'm the One,' or, 'The end is near.' Don't
fall for any of that.
9 When you hear of wars and uprisings,
keep your head and don't panic. This is
rou ne history and no sign of the end."
10 He went on, "Na on will ﬁght na on
and ruler ﬁght ruler, over and over.
11 Huge earthquakes will occur in
various places. There will be famines.
You'll think at mes that the very sky is
falling.LUKE 21

12 "But before any of this happens,
they'll arrest you, hunt you down, and
drag you to court and jail. It will go from
bad to worse, dog-eat-dog, everyone at
your throat because you carry my name.
13 You'll end up on the witness stand,
called to tes fy.
14 Make up your mind right now not to
worry about it.
15 I'll give you the words and wisdom
that will reduce all your accusers to
stammers and stu ers.
16 "You'll even be turned in by parents,
brothers, rela ves, and friends. Some of
you will be killed.
17 There's no telling who will hate you
because of me.
18 Even so, every detail of your body

159
19 Staying with it--that's what is
required. Stay with it to the end. You
won't be sorry; you'll be saved.
20 "When you see soldiers camped all
around Jerusalem, then you'll know that
she is about to be devastated.

the world in a panic, the wind knocked
out of them by the threat of doom, the
powers-that-be quaking.
27 "And then--then!--they'll see the
Son of Man welcomed in grand style--a
glorious welcome!
28 When all this starts to happen, up
on your feet. Stand tall with your heads
high. Help is on the way!"
29 He told them a story. "Look at a ﬁg

30 When the leaves begin to show,
one look tells you that summer is right
around the corner.
31 The same here--when you see these
things happen, you know God's kingdom

33 Sky and earth will wear out; my

34 "But be on your guard. Don't let
the sharp edge of your expecta on

shopping. Otherwise, that Day is going
to take you by complete surprise, spring
on you suddenly like a trap,
35 for it's going to come on everyone,
everywhere, at once.
36 So, whatever you do, don't go to
sleep at the switch. Pray constantly that
you will have the strength and wits
to make it through everything that's
coming and end up on your feet before
the Son of Man."
37 He spent his days in the Temple
teaching, but his nights out on the
mountain called Olives.
38 All the people were up at the crack of
dawn to come to the Temple and listen
to him.LUKE 22
22
162
1 The Feast of Unleavened Bread,
also called Passover, drew near.
2 The high priests and religion scholars
were looking for a way to do away with
Jesus but, fearful of the people, they
were also looking for a way to cover
their tracks.
3 That's when Satan entered Judas, the
one called Iscariot. He was one of the
Twelve.
4 Leaving the others, he conferred with
the high priests and the Temple guards
about how he might betray Jesus to
them.
5 They couldn't believe their good luck
and agreed to pay him well.
6 He gave them his word and started
looking for a way to betray Jesus, but out
of sight of the crowd.
7 The Day of Unleavened Bread
came, the day the Passover lamb was
butchered.LUKE 22
163
8 Jesus sent Peter and John oﬀ, saying,
"Go prepare the Passover for us so we
can eat it together."
9 They said, "Where do you want us to
do this?"
10 He said, "Keep your eyes open as you
enter the city. A man carrying a water
jug will meet you. Follow him home.
11 Then speak with the owner of the
house: The Teacher wants to know,
'Where is the guest room where I can eat
the Passover meal with my disciples?'
12 He will show you a spacious second-
story room, swept and ready. Prepare
the meal there."
13 They le , found everything just as he
told them, and prepared the Passover
meal.
14 When it was me, he sat down, all
the apostles with him,
15 and said, "You've no idea how much
I have looked forward to ea ng thisLUKE 22
164
Passover meal with you before I enter
my me of suﬀering.
16 It's the last one I'll eat un l we all eat
it together in the kingdom of God."
17 Taking the cup, he blessed it, then
said, "Take this and pass it among you.
18 As for me, I'll not drink wine again
un l the kingdom of God arrives."
19 Taking bread, he blessed it, broke
it, and gave it to them, saying, "This
is my body, given for you. Eat it in my
memory."
20 He did the same with the cup a er
supper, saying, "This cup is the new
covenant wri en in my blood, blood
poured out for you.
21 "Do you realize that the hand of
the one who is betraying me is at this
moment on this table?
22 It's true that the Son of Man is going
down a path already marked out--no
surprises there. But for the one whoLUKE 22
165
turns him in, turns traitor to the Son of
Man, this is doomsday."
23 They immediately became suspicious
of each other and began quizzing one
another, wondering who might be about
to do this.
24 Within minutes they were bickering
over who of them would end up the
greatest.
25 But Jesus intervened: "Kings like to
throw their weight around and people in
authority like to give themselves fancy
tles.
26 It's not going to be that way with
you. Let the senior among you become
like the junior; let the leader act the part
of the servant.
27 "Who would you rather be: the one
who eats the dinner or the one who
serves the dinner? You'd rather eat and
be served, right? But I've taken my place
among you as the one who serves.LUKE 22
166
28 And you've stuck with me through
thick and thin.
29 Now I confer on you the royal
authority my Father conferred on me
30 so you can eat and drink at my table
in my kingdom and be strengthened as
you take up responsibili es among the
congrega ons of God's people.
31 "Simon, stay on your toes. Satan has
tried his best to separate all of you from
me, like chaﬀ from wheat.
32 Simon, I've prayed for you in
par cular that you not give in or give
out. When you have come through the
me of tes ng, turn to your companions
and give them a fresh start."
33 Peter said, "Master, I'm ready for
anything with you. I'd go to jail for you.
I'd die for you!"
34 Jesus said, "I'm sorry to have to tell
you this, Peter, but before the roosterLUKE 22
167
crows you will have three mes denied
that you know me."
35 Then Jesus said, "When I sent you
out and told you to travel light, to take
only the bare necessi es, did you get
along all right?" "Certainly," they said,
"we got along just ﬁne."
36 He said, "This is diﬀerent. Get ready
for trouble. Look to what you'll need;
there are diﬃcult mes ahead. Pawn
your coat and get a sword.
37 What was wri en in Scripture, 'He
was lumped in with the criminals,' gets
its ﬁnal meaning in me. Everything
wri en about me is now coming to a
conclusion."
38 They said, "Look, Master, two
swords!" But he said, "Enough of that;
no more sword talk!"
39 Leaving there, he went, as he so
o en did, to Mount Olives. The disciples
followed him.LUKE 22
168
40 When they arrived at the place, he
said, "Pray that you don't give in to
tempta on."
41 He pulled away from them about a
stone's throw, knelt down, and prayed,
42 "Father, remove this cup from me.
But please, not what I want. What do
you want?"
43 At once an angel from heaven was at
his side, strengthening him.
44 He prayed on all the harder. Sweat,
wrung from him like drops of blood,
poured oﬀ his face.
45 He got up from prayer, went back
to the disciples and found them asleep,
drugged by grief.
46 He said, "What business do you have
sleeping? Get up. Pray so you won't give
in to tempta on."
47 No sooner were the words out of his
mouth than a crowd showed up, Judas,LUKE 22
169
the one from the Twelve, in the lead. He
came right up to Jesus to kiss him.
48 Jesus said, "Judas, you would betray
the Son of Man with a kiss?"
49 When those with him saw what was
happening, they said, "Master, shall we
ﬁght?"
50 One of them took a swing at the
Chief Priest's servant and cut oﬀ his right
ear.
51 Jesus said, "Let them be. Even in
this." Then, touching the servant's ear,
he healed him.
52 Jesus spoke to those who had
come--high priests, Temple police,
religion leaders: "What is this, jumping
me with swords and clubs as if I were a
dangerous criminal?
53 Day a er day I've been with you in
the Temple and you've not so much as
li ed a hand against me. But do it your
way--it's a dark night, a dark hour."LUKE 22
54 Arres
170
ng Jesus, they marched him
oﬀ and took him into the house of the
Chief Priest. Peter followed, but at a safe
distance.
55 In the middle of the courtyard some
people had started a ﬁre and were si ng
around it, trying to keep warm.
56 One of the serving maids si ng at
the ﬁre no ced him, then took a second
look and said, "This man was with him!"
57 He denied it, "Woman, I don't even
know him."
58 A short me later, someone else
no ced him and said, "You're one of
them." But Peter denied it: "Man, I am
not."
59 About an hour later, someone else
spoke up, really adamant: "He's got to
have been with him! He's got 'Galilean'
wri en all over him."
60 Peter said, "Man, I don't know what
you're talking about." At that veryLUKE 22
171
moment, the last word hardly oﬀ his lips,
a rooster crowed.
61 Just then, the Master turned and
looked at Peter. Peter remembered what
the Master had said to him: "Before the
rooster crows, you will deny me three
mes."
62 He went out and cried and cried and
cried.
63 The men in charge of Jesus began
poking fun at him, slapping him around.
64 They put a blindfold on him and
taunted, "Who hit you that me?"
65 They were having a grand me with
him.
66 When it was morning, the religious
leaders of the people and the high
priests and scholars all got together and
brought him before their High Council.
67 They said, "Are you the Messiah?"
He answered, "If I said yes, you wouldn't
believe me.LUKE 22 – 23
172
68 If I asked what you meant by your
ques on, you wouldn't answer me.
69 So here's what I have to say: From
here on the Son of Man takes his place
at God's right hand, the place of power."
70 They all said, "So you admit your
claim to be the Son of God?" "You're the
ones who keep saying it," he said.
71 But they had made up their minds,
"Why do we need any more evidence?
We've all heard him as good as say it
himself."
1 Then they all took Jesus to Pilate
2 and began to bring up charges
against him. They said, "We found this
man undermining our law and order,
forbidding taxes to be paid to Caesar,
se ng himself up as Messiah-King."
3 Pilate asked him, "Is this true that
you're 'King of the Jews'?" "Those are
your words, not mine," Jesus replied.
23LUKE 23
173
4 Pilate told the high priests and the
accompanying crowd, "I ﬁnd nothing
wrong here. He seems harmless enough
to me."
5 But they were vehement. "He's
s rring up unrest among the people
with his teaching, disturbing the peace
everywhere, star ng in Galilee and now
all through Judea. He's a dangerous man,
endangering the peace."
6 When Pilate heard that, he asked, "So,
he's a Galilean?"
7 Realizing that he properly came under
Herod's jurisdic on, he passed the buck
to Herod, who just happened to be in
Jerusalem for a few days.
8 Herod was delighted when Jesus
showed up. He had wanted for a long
me to see him, he'd heard so much
about him. He hoped to see him do
something spectacular.LUKE 23
9 He peppered him with ques
174
ons.
Jesus didn't answer--not one word.
10 But the high priests and religion
scholars were right there, saying
their piece, strident and shrill in their
accusa ons.
11 Migh ly oﬀended, Herod turned on
Jesus. His soldiers joined in, taun ng
and jeering. Then they dressed him up in
an elaborate king costume and sent him
back to Pilate.
12 That day Herod and Pilate became
thick as thieves. Always before they had
kept their distance.
13 Then Pilate called in the high priests,
rulers, and the others
14 and said, "You brought this man
to me as a disturber of the peace. I
examined him in front of all of you and
found there was nothing to your charge.
15 And neither did Herod, for he has
sent him back here with a clean bill ofLUKE 23
175
health. It's clear that he's done nothing
wrong, let alone anything deserving
death.
16 I'm going to warn him to watch his
step and let him go."
18 At that, the crowd went wild: "Kill
him! Give us Barabbas!"
19 (Barabbas had been thrown in prison
for star ng a riot in the city and for
murder.)
20 Pilate s ll wanted to let Jesus go, and
so spoke out again.
21 But they kept shou ng back, "Crucify!
Crucify him!"
22 He tried a third me. "But for
what crime? I've found nothing in him
deserving death. I'm going to warn him
to watch his step and let him go."
23 But they kept at it, a shou ng mob,
demanding that he be cruciﬁed. And
ﬁnally they shouted him down.LUKE 23
176
24 Pilate caved in and gave them what
they wanted.
25 He released the man thrown in
prison for rio ng and murder, and gave
them Jesus to do whatever they wanted.
26 As they led him oﬀ, they made Simon,
a man from Cyrene who happened to be
coming in from the countryside, carry
the cross behind Jesus.
27 A huge crowd of people followed,
along with women weeping and carrying
on.
28 At one point Jesus turned to
the women and said, "Daughters of
Jerusalem, don't cry for me. Cry for
yourselves and for your children.
29 The me is coming when they'll say,
'Lucky the women who never conceived!
Lucky the wombs that never gave birth!
Lucky the breasts that never gave milk!'LUKE 23
177
30 Then they'll start calling to the
mountains, 'Fall down on us!' calling to
the hills, 'Cover us up!'
31 If people do these things to a live,
green tree, can you imagine what they'll
do with deadwood?"
32 Two others, both criminals, were
taken along with him for execu on.
33 When they got to the place called
Skull Hill, they cruciﬁed him, along with
the criminals, one on his right, the other
on his le .
34 Jesus prayed, "Father, forgive them;
they don't know what they're doing."
Dividing up his clothes, they threw dice
for them.
35 The people stood there staring at
Jesus, and the ringleaders made faces,
taun ng, "He saved others. Let's see him
save himself! The Messiah of God--ha!
The Chosen--ha!"LUKE 23
178
36 The soldiers also came up and poked
fun at him, making a game of it. They
toasted him with sour wine:
37 "So you're King of the Jews! Save
yourself!"
38 Printed over him was a sign: THIS IS
THE KING OF THE JEWS.
39 One of the criminals hanging
alongside cursed him: "Some Messiah
you are! Save yourself! Save us!"
40 But the other one made him shut up:
"Have you no fear of God? You're ge ng
the same as him.
41 We deserve this, but not him--he did
nothing to deserve this."
42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me
when you enter your kingdom."
43 He said, "Don't worry, I will. Today
you will join me in paradise."
44 By now it was noon. The whole earth
became dark, the darkness las ng three
hours--LUKE 23
179
45 a total blackout. The Temple curtain
split right down the middle.
46 Jesus called loudly, "Father, I place
my life in your hands!" Then he breathed
his last.
47 When the captain there saw what
happened, he honored God: "This
man was innocent! A good man, and
innocent!"
48 All who had come around as
spectators to watch the show, when
they saw what actually happened, were
overcome with grief and headed home.
49 Those who knew Jesus well, along
with the women who had followed
him from Galilee, stood at a respec ul
distance and kept vigil.
50 There was a man by the name of
Joseph, a member of the Jewish High
Council, a man of good heart and good
character.LUKE 23 – 24
180
51 He had not gone along with the
plans and ac ons of the council. His
hometown was the Jewish village of
Arimathea.
52 He lived in alert expecta on of the
kingdom of God. He went to Pilate and
asked for the body of Jesus.
53 Taking him down, he wrapped him in
a linen shroud and placed him in a tomb
chiseled into the rock, a tomb never yet
used.
54 It was the day before Sabbath, the
Sabbath just about to begin.
55 The women who had been
companions of Jesus from Galilee
followed along. They saw the tomb
where Jesus' body was placed.
56 Then they went back to prepare
burial spices and perfumes. They rested
quietly on the Sabbath, as commanded.
1 At the crack of dawn on Sunday,
the women came to the tomb
24LUKE 24
181
carrying the burial spices they had
prepared.
2 They found the entrance stone rolled
back from the tomb,
3 so they walked in. But once inside,
they couldn't ﬁnd the body of the Master
Jesus.
4 They were puzzled, wondering what
to make of this. Then, out of nowhere it
seemed, two men, light cascading over
them, stood there.
5 The women were awestruck and
bowed down in worship. The men said,
"Why are you looking for the Living One
in a cemetery?
6 He is not here, but raised up.
Remember how he told you when you
were s ll back in Galilee
7 that he had to be handed over to
sinners, be killed on a cross, and in three
days rise up?"
8 Then they remembered Jesus' words.LUKE 24
9 They le
182
the tomb and broke the news
of all this to the Eleven and the rest.
10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the
mother of James, and the other women
with them kept telling these things to
the apostles,
11 but the apostles didn't believe a
word of it, thought they were making it
all up.
12 But Peter jumped to his feet and ran
to the tomb. He stooped to look in and
saw a few grave clothes, that's all. He
walked away puzzled, shaking his head.
13 That same day two of them were
walking to the village Emmaus, about
seven miles out of Jerusalem.
14 They were deep in conversa on,
going over all these things that had
happened.
15 In the middle of their talk and
ques ons, Jesus came up and walked
along with them.LUKE 24
183
16 But they were not able to recognize
who he was.
17 He asked, "What's this you're
discussing so intently as you walk
along?" They just stood there, long-
faced, like they had lost their best
friend.
18 Then one of them, his name was
Cleopas, said, "Are you the only one
in Jerusalem who hasn't heard what's
happened during the last few days?"
19 He said, "What has happened?" They
said, "The things that happened to Jesus
the Nazarene. He was a man of God,
a prophet, dynamic in work and word,
blessed by both God and all the people.
20 Then our high priests and leaders
betrayed him, got him sentenced to
death, and cruciﬁed him.
21 And we had our hopes up that he
was the One, the One about to deliverLUKE 24
184
Israel. And it is now the third day since it
happened.
22 But now some of our women have
completely confused us. Early this
morning they were at the tomb
23 and couldn't ﬁnd his body. They came
back with the story that they had seen a
vision of angels who said he was alive.
24 Some of our friends went oﬀ to the
tomb to check and found it empty just
as the women said, but they didn't see
Jesus."
25 Then he said to them, "So thick-
headed! So slow-hearted! Why can't you
simply believe all that the prophets said?
26 Don't you see that these things
had to happen, that the Messiah had
to suﬀer and only then enter into his
glory?"
27 Then he started at the beginning,
with the Books of Moses, and went on
through all the Prophets, poin ng outLUKE 24
185
everything in the Scriptures that referred
to him.
28 They came to the edge of the village
where they were headed. He acted as if
he were going on
29 but they pressed him: "Stay and have
supper with us. It's nearly evening; the
day is done." So he went in with them.
30 And here is what happened: He sat
down at the table with them. Taking the
bread, he blessed and broke and gave it
to them.
31 At that moment, open-eyed, wide-
eyed, they recognized him. And then he
disappeared.
32 Back and forth they talked. "Didn't
we feel on ﬁre as he conversed with
us on the road, as he opened up the
Scriptures for us?"
33 They didn't waste a minute. They
were up and on their way back toLUKE 24
186
Jerusalem. They found the Eleven and
their friends gathered together,
34 talking away: "It's really happened!
The Master has been raised up--Simon
saw him!"
35 Then the two went over everything
that happened on the road and how
they recognized him when he broke the
bread.
36 While they were saying all this, Jesus
appeared to them and said, "Peace be
with you."
37 They thought they were seeing a
ghost and were scared half to death.
38 He con nued with them, "Don't be
upset, and don't let all these doub ng
ques ons take over.
39 Look at my hands; look at my feet--it's
really me. Touch me. Look me over from
head to toe. A ghost doesn't have muscle
and bone like this."LUKE 24
187
40 As he said this, he showed them his
hands and feet.
41 They s ll couldn't believe what they
were seeing. It was too much; it seemed
too good to be true. He asked, "Do you
have any food here?"
42 They gave him a piece of le over ﬁsh
they had cooked.
43 He took it and ate it right before their
eyes.
44 Then he said, "Everything I told you
while I was with you comes to this: All
the things wri en about me in the Law
of Moses, in the Prophets, and in the
Psalms have to be fulﬁlled."
45 He went on to open their
understanding of the Word of
God, showing them how to read their
Bibles this way.
46 He said, "You can see now how it is
wri en that the Messiah suﬀers, rises
from the dead on the third day,LUKE 24
188
47 and then a total life-change through
the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed in
his name to all na ons--star ng from
here, from Jerusalem!
48 You're the ﬁrst to hear and see it.
You're the witnesses.
49 What comes next is very important:
I am sending what my Father promised
to you, so stay here in the city un l
he arrives, un l you're equipped with
power from on high."
50 He then led them out of the city over
to Bethany. Raising his hands he blessed
them,
51 and while blessing them, took his
leave, being carried up to heaven.
52 And they were on their knees,
worshiping him. They returned to
Jerusalem burs ng with joy.
53 They spent all their me in the
Temple praising God. Yes.John
1
1 The Word was ﬁrst, the Word
present to God, God present to the
Word. The Word was God,
2 in readiness for God from day one.
3 Everything was created through him;
nothing--not one thing!--came into
being without him.
4 What came into existence was Life,
and the Life was Light to live by.
5 The Life-Light blazed out of the
darkness; the darkness couldn't put it
out.
6 There once was a man, his name John,
sent by God
7 to point out the way to the Life-Light.
He came to show everyone where to
look, who to believe in.JOHN 1
2
8 John was not himself the Light; he was
there to show the way to the Light.
9 The Life-Light was the real thing: Every
person entering Life he brings into Light.
10 He was in the world, the world was
there through him, and yet the world
didn't even no ce.
11 He came to his own people, but they
didn't want him.
12 But whoever did want him, who
believed he was who he claimed and
would do what he said, He made to
be their true selves, their child-of-God
selves.
13 These are the God-bego en, not
blood-bego en, not ﬂesh-bego en, not
sex-bego en.
14 The Word became ﬂesh and blood,
and moved into the neighborhood. We
saw the glory with our own eyes, the
one-of-a-kind glory, like Father, like Son,JOHN 1
3
Generous inside and out, true from start
to ﬁnish.
15 John pointed him out and called,
"This is the One! The One I told you was
coming a er me but in fact was ahead
of me. He has always been ahead of me,
has always had the ﬁrst word."
16 We all live oﬀ his generous bounty,
gi a er gi a er gi .
17 We got the basics from Moses,
and then this exuberant giving and
receiving, This endless knowing and
understanding--all this came through
Jesus, the Messiah.
18 No one has ever seen God, not so
much as a glimpse. This one-of-a-kind
God-Expression, who exists at the very
heart of the Father, has made him plain
as day.
19 When Jews from Jerusalem sent a
group of priests and oﬃcials to ask John
who he was, he was completely honest.JOHN 1
20 He didn't evade the ques
4
on. He told
the plain truth: "I am not the Messiah."
21 They pressed him, "Who, then?
Elijah?" "I am not." "The Prophet?" "No."
22 Exasperated, they said, "Who, then?
We need an answer for those who sent
us. Tell us something--anything!--about
yourself."
23 "I'm thunder in the desert: 'Make the
road straight for God!' I'm doing what
the prophet Isaiah preached."
24 Those sent to ques on him were
from the Pharisee party.
25 Now they had a ques on of their
own: "If you're neither the Messiah,
nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why do you
bap ze?"
26 John answered, "I only bap ze using
water. A person you don't recognize has
taken his stand in your midst.JOHN 1
27 He comes a
5
er me, but he is not in
second place to me. I'm not even worthy
to hold his coat for him."
28 These conversa ons took place in
Bethany on the other side of the Jordan,
where John was bap zing at the me.
29 The very next day John saw Jesus
coming toward him and yelled out,
30 "Here he is, God's Passover Lamb! He
forgives the sins of the world! This is the
man I've been talking about, 'the One
who comes a er me but is really ahead
of me.'
31 I knew nothing about who he
was--only this: that my task has been to
get Israel ready to recognize him as the
God-Revealer. That is why I came here
bap zing with water, giving you a good
bath and scrubbing sins from your life so
you can get a fresh start with God."
32 John clinched his witness with this:
"I watched the Spirit, like a dove ﬂyingJOHN 1
6
down out of the sky, making himself at
home in him.
33 I repeat, I know nothing about him
except this: The One who authorized me
to bap ze with water told me, 'The One
on whom you see the Spirit come down
and stay, this One will bap ze with the
Holy Spirit.'
34 That's exactly what I saw happen,
and I'm telling you, there's no ques on
about it: This is the Son of God."
35 The next day John was back at his
post with two disciples, who were
watching.
36 He looked up, saw Jesus walking
nearby, and said, "Here he is, God's
Passover Lamb."
37 The two disciples heard him and
went a er Jesus.
38 Jesus looked over his shoulder and
said to them, "What are you a er?" TheyJOHN 1
7
said, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"),
"where are you staying?"
39 He replied, "Come along and see for
yourself." They came, saw where he was
living, and ended up staying with him for
the day. It was late a ernoon when this
happened.
40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was
one of the two who heard John's witness
and followed Jesus.
41 The ﬁrst thing he did a er ﬁnding
where Jesus lived was ﬁnd his own
brother, Simon, telling him, "We've
found the Messiah" (that is, "Christ").
42 He immediately led him to Jesus.
Jesus took one look up and said, "You're
John's son, Simon? From now on your
name is Cephas" (or Peter, which means
"Rock").
43 The next day Jesus decided to go
to Galilee. When he got there, he ranJOHN 1
8
across Philip and said, "Come, follow
me."
44 (Philip's hometown was Bethsaida,
the same as Andrew and Peter.)
45 Philip went and found Nathanael and
told him, "We've found the One Moses
wrote of in the Law, the One preached
by the prophets. It's Jesus, Joseph's son,
the one from Nazareth!"
46 Nathanael said, "Nazareth? You've
got to be kidding." But Philip said,
"Come, see for yourself."
47 When Jesus saw him coming he said,
"There's a real Israelite, not a false bone
in his body."
48 Nathanael said, "Where did you get
that idea? You don't know me." Jesus
answered, "One day, long before Philip
called you here, I saw you under the ﬁg
tree."
49 Nathanael exclaimed, "Rabbi! You
are the Son of God, the King of Israel!"JOHN 1 – 2
9
50 Jesus said, "You've become a believer
simply because I say I saw you one day
si ng under the ﬁg tree? You haven't
seen anything yet!
51 Before this is over you're going to
see heaven open and God's angels
descending to the Son of Man and
ascending again."
1 Three days later there was a
wedding in the village of Cana in
Galilee. Jesus' mother was there.
2 Jesus and his disciples were guests
also.
3 When they started running low on
wine at the wedding banquet, Jesus'
mother told him, "They're just about out
of wine."
4 Jesus said, "Is that any of our business,
Mother--yours or mine? This isn't my
me. Don't push me."
5 She went ahead anyway, telling the
servants, "Whatever he tells you, do it."
2JOHN 2
10
6 Six stoneware water pots were there,
used by the Jews for ritual washings.
Each held twenty to thirty gallons.
7 Jesus ordered the servants, "Fill the
pots with water." And they ﬁlled them to
the brim.
8 "Now ﬁll your pitchers and take them
to the host," Jesus said, and they did.
9 When the host tasted the water that
had become wine (he didn't know what
had just happened but the servants,
of course, knew), he called out to the
bridegroom,
10 "Everybody I know begins with their
ﬁnest wines and a er the guests have
had their ﬁll brings in the cheap stuﬀ.
But you've saved the best ll now!"
11 This act in Cana of Galilee was the
ﬁrst sign Jesus gave, the ﬁrst glimpse of
his glory. And his disciples believed in
him.JOHN 2
12 A
11
er this he went down to
Capernaum along with his mother,
brothers, and disciples, and stayed
several days.
13 When the Passover Feast, celebrated
each spring by the Jews, was about
to take place, Jesus traveled up to
Jerusalem.
14 He found the Temple teeming with
people selling ca le and sheep and
doves. The loan sharks were also there
in full strength.
15 Jesus put together a whip out of
strips of leather and chased them out of
the Temple, stampeding the sheep and
ca le, upending the tables of the loan
sharks, spilling coins le and right.
16 He told the dove merchants, "Get
your things out of here! Stop turning my
Father's house into a shopping mall!"JOHN 2
12
17 That's when his disciples
remembered the Scripture, "Zeal
for your house consumes me."
18 But the Jews were upset. They asked,
"What creden als can you present to
jus fy this?"
19 Jesus answered, "Tear down this
Temple and in three days I'll put it back
together."
20 They were indignant: "It took forty-six
years to build this Temple, and you're
going to rebuild it in three days?"
21 But Jesus was talking about his body
as the Temple.
22 Later, a er he was raised from the
dead, his disciples remembered he had
said this. They then put two and two
together and believed both what was
wri en in Scripture and what Jesus had
said.
23 During the me he was in Jerusalem,
those days of the Passover Feast,JOHN 2 – 3
13
many people no ced the signs he was
displaying and, seeing they pointed
straight to God, entrusted their lives to
him.
24 But Jesus didn't entrust his life to
them. He knew them inside and out,
knew how untrustworthy they were.
25 He didn't need any help in seeing
right through them.
1 There was a man of the Pharisee
sect, Nicodemus, a prominent leader
among the Jews.
2 Late one night he visited Jesus and
said, "Rabbi, we all know you're a
teacher straight from God. No one could
do all the God-poin ng, God-revealing
acts you do if God weren't in on it."
3 Jesus said, "You're absolutely right.
Take it from me: Unless a person is born
from above, it's not possible to see what
I'm poin ng to--to God's kingdom."
3JOHN 3
14
4 "How can anyone," said Nicodemus,
"be born who has already been born
and grown up? You can't re-enter
your mother's womb and be born
again. What are you saying with this
'born-from-above' talk?"
5 Jesus said, "You're not listening. Let
me say it again. Unless a person submits
to this original crea on--the 'wind
hovering over the water' crea on, the
invisible moving the visible, a bap sm
into a new life--it's not possible to enter
God's kingdom.
6 When you look at a baby, it's just that:
a body you can look at and touch. But
the person who takes shape within is
formed by something you can't see and
touch--the Spirit--and becomes a living
spirit.
7 "So don't be so surprised when I tell
you that you have to be 'born from
above'--out of this world, so to speak.JOHN 3
15
8 You know well enough how the wind
blows this way and that. You hear it
rustling through the trees, but you have
no idea where it comes from or where
it's headed next. That's the way it is with
everyone 'born from above' by the wind
of God, the Spirit of God."
9 Nicodemus asked, "What do you
mean by this? How does this happen?"
10 Jesus said, "You're a respected
teacher of Israel and you don't know
these basics?
11 Listen carefully. I'm speaking sober
truth to you. I speak only of what I
know by experience; I give witness
only to what I have seen with my own
eyes. There is nothing secondhand
here, no hearsay. Yet instead of facing
the evidence and accep ng it, you
procras nate with ques ons.
12 If I tell you things that are plain as
the hand before your face and you don'tJOHN 3
16
believe me, what use is there in telling
you of things you can't see, the things of
God?
13 "No one has ever gone up into the
presence of God except the One who
came down from that Presence, the Son
of Man.
14 In the same way that Moses li ed the
serpent in the desert so people could
have something to see and then believe,
it is necessary for the Son of Man to be
li ed up--
15 and everyone who looks up to him,
trus ng and expectant, will gain a real
life, eternal life.
16 "This is how much God loved the
world: He gave his Son, his one and only
Son. And this is why: so that no one
need be destroyed; by believing in him,
anyone can have a whole and las ng life.
17 God didn't go to all the trouble of
sending his Son merely to point anJOHN 3
17
accusing ﬁnger, telling the world how
bad it was. He came to help, to put the
world right again.
18 Anyone who trusts in him is
acqui ed; anyone who refuses to trust
him has long since been under the
death sentence without knowing it. And
why? Because of that person's failure to
believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God
when introduced to him.
19 "This is the crisis we're in: God-light
streamed into the world, but men
and women everywhere ran for the
darkness. They went for the darkness
because they were not really interested
in pleasing God.
20 Everyone who makes a prac ce
of doing evil, addicted to denial and
illusion, hates God-light and won't come
near it, fearing a painful exposure.
21 But anyone working and living in
truth and reality welcomes God-light soJOHN 3
18
the work can be seen for the God-work
it is."
22 A er this conversa on, Jesus went
on with his disciples into the Judean
countryside and relaxed with them
there. He was also bap zing.
23 At the same me, John was bap zing
over at Aenon near Salim, where water
was abundant.
24 This was before John was thrown
into jail.
25 John's disciples got into an argument
with the establishment Jews over the
nature of bap sm.
26 They came to John and said, "Rabbi,
you know the one who was with you
on the other side of the Jordan? The
one you authorized with your witness?
Well, he's now compe ng with us. He's
bap zing, too, and everyone's going to
him instead of us."JOHN 3
19
27 John answered, "It's not possible for
a person to succeed--I'm talking about
[eternal] success--without heaven's
help.
28 You yourselves were there when I
made it public that I was not the Messiah
but simply the one sent ahead of him to
get things ready.
29 The one who gets the bride is, by
deﬁni on, the bridegroom. And the
bridegroom's friend, his 'best man'--
that's me--in place at his side where he
can hear every word, is genuinely happy.
How could he be jealous when he knows
that the wedding is ﬁnished and the
marriage is oﬀ to a good start? "That's
why my cup is running over.
30 This is the assigned moment for him
to move into the center, while I slip oﬀ
to the sidelines.
31 "The One who comes from above
is head and shoulders over otherJOHN 3
20
messengers from God. The earthborn is
earthbound and speaks earth language;
the heavenborn is in a league of his own.
32 He sets out the evidence of what he
saw and heard in heaven. No one wants
to deal with these facts.
33 But anyone who examines this
evidence will come to stake his life on
this: that God himself is the truth.
34 "The One that God sent speaks God's
words. And don't think he ra ons out
the Spirit in bits and pieces.
35 The Father loves the Son
extravagantly. He turned everything
over to him so he could give it away--a
lavish distribu on of gi s.
36 That is why whoever accepts and
trusts the Son gets in on everything,
life complete and forever! And that is
also why the person who avoids and
distrusts the Son is in the dark and
doesn't see life. All he experiences ofJOHN 4
21
God is darkness, and an angry darkness
at that."
1 Jesus realized that the Pharisees
were keeping count of the bap sms
that he and John performed
2 (although his disciples, not Jesus, did
the actual bap zing). They had posted
the score that Jesus was ahead, turning
him and John into rivals in the eyes of
the people.
3 So Jesus le the Judean countryside
and went back to Galilee.
4 To get there, he had to pass through
Samaria.
5 He came into Sychar, a Samaritan
village that bordered the ﬁeld Jacob had
given his son Joseph.
6 Jacob's well was s ll there. Jesus,
worn out by the trip, sat down at the
well. It was noon.
4JOHN 4
22
7 A woman, a Samaritan, came to draw
water. Jesus said, "Would you give me a
drink of water?"
8 (His disciples had gone to the village
to buy food for lunch.)
9 The Samaritan woman, taken aback,
asked, "How come you, a Jew, are asking
me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?"
(Jews in those days wouldn't be caught
dead talking to Samaritans.)
10 Jesus answered, "If you knew the
generosity of God and who I am, you
would be asking me for a drink, and I
would give you fresh, living water."
11 The woman said, "Sir, you don't even
have a bucket to draw with, and this well
is deep. So how are you going to get this
'living water'?
12 Are you a be er man than our
ancestor Jacob, who dug this well and
drank from it, he and his sons and
livestock, and passed it down to us?"JOHN 4
23
13 Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks this
water will get thirsty again and again.
14 Anyone who drinks the water I give
will never thirst--not ever. The water I
give will be an artesian spring within,
gushing fountains of endless life."
15 The woman said, "Sir, give me this
water so I won't ever get thirsty, won't
ever have to come back to this well
again!"
16 He said, "Go call your husband and
then come back."
17 "I have no husband," she said. "That's
nicely put: 'I have no husband.'
18 You've had ﬁve husbands, and the
man you're living with now isn't even
your husband. You spoke the truth there,
sure enough."
19 "Oh, so you're a prophet!
20 Well, tell me this: Our ancestors
worshiped God at this mountain, butJOHN 4
24
you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only
place for worship, right?"
21 "Believe me, woman, the me
is coming when you Samaritans will
worship the Father neither here at this
mountain nor there in Jerusalem.
22 You worship guessing in the dark; we
Jews worship in the clear light of day.
God's way of salva on is made available
through the Jews.
23 But the me is coming--it has, in fact,
come--when what you're called will not
ma er and where you go to worship
will not ma er. "It's who you are and
the way you live that count before God.
Your worship must engage your spirit
in the pursuit of truth. That's the kind
of people the Father is out looking for:
those who are simply and honestly
themselves before him in their worship.
24 God is sheer being itself--Spirit.
Those who worship him must do it outJOHN 4
25
of their very being, their spirits, their
true selves, in adora on."
25 The woman said, "I don't know about
that. I do know that the Messiah is
coming. When he arrives, we'll get the
whole story."
26 "I am he," said Jesus. "You don't have
to wait any longer or look any further."
27 Just then his disciples came back.
They were shocked. They couldn't
believe he was talking with that kind of a
woman. No one said what they were all
thinking, but their faces showed it.
28 The woman took the hint and le .
In her confusion she le her water pot.
Back in the village she told the people,
29 "Come see a man who knew all about
the things I did, who knows me inside
and out. Do you think this could be the
Messiah?"
30 And they went out to see for
themselves.JOHN 4
31 In the mean
26
me, the disciples
pressed him, "Rabbi, eat. Aren't you
going to eat?"
32 He told them, "I have food to eat you
know nothing about."
33 The disciples were puzzled. "Who
could have brought him food?"
34 Jesus said, "The food that keeps me
going is that I do the will of the One who
sent me, ﬁnishing the work he started.
35 As you look around right now,
wouldn't you say that in about four
months it will be me to harvest? Well,
I'm telling you to open your eyes and
take a good look at what's right in front
of you. These Samaritan ﬁelds are ripe.
It's harvest me!
36 "The Harvester isn't wai ng. He's
taking his pay, gathering in this grain
that's ripe for eternal life. Now the
Sower is arm in arm with the Harvester,
triumphant.JOHN 4
27
37 That's the truth of the saying, 'This
one sows, that one harvests.'
38 I sent you to harvest a ﬁeld you never
worked. Without li ing a ﬁnger, you
have walked in on a ﬁeld worked long
and hard by others."
39 Many of the Samaritans from that
village commi ed themselves to him
because of the woman's witness: "He
knew all about the things I did. He knows
me inside and out!"
40 They asked him to stay on, so Jesus
stayed two days.
41 A lot more people entrusted their
lives to him when they heard what he
had to say.
42 They said to the woman, "We're no
longer taking this on your say-so. We've
heard it for ourselves and know it for
sure. He's the Savior of the world!"
43 A er the two days he le for Galilee.JOHN 4
28
44 Now, Jesus knew well from
experience that a prophet is not
respected in the place where he grew
up.
45 So when he arrived in Galilee, the
Galileans welcomed him, but only
because they were impressed with what
he had done in Jerusalem during the
Passover Feast, not that they really had
a clue about who he was or what he was
up to.
46 Now he was back in Cana of Galilee,
the place where he made the water into
wine. Meanwhile in Capernaum, there
was a certain oﬃcial from the king's
court whose son was sick.
47 When he heard that Jesus had come
from Judea to Galilee, he went and
asked that he come down and heal his
son, who was on the brink of death.JOHN 4
29
48 Jesus put him oﬀ: "Unless you people
are dazzled by a miracle, you refuse to
believe."
49 But the court oﬃcial wouldn't be put
oﬀ. "Come down! It's life or death for my
son."
50 Jesus simply replied, "Go home. Your
son lives." The man believed the bare
word Jesus spoke and headed home.
51 On his way back, his servants
intercepted him and announced, "Your
son lives!"
52 He asked them what me he began
to get be er. They said, "The fever broke
yesterday a ernoon at one o'clock."
53 The father knew that that was the
very moment Jesus had said, "Your son
lives." That clinched it. Not only he but
his en re household believed.
54 This was now the second sign Jesus
gave a er having come from Judea into
Galilee.JOHN 5
5
30
1 Soon another Feast came around
and Jesus was back in Jerusalem.
2 Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem
there was a pool, in Hebrew called
[Bethesda], with ﬁve alcoves.
3 Hundreds of sick people--blind,
crippled, paralyzed--were in these
alcoves.
5 One man had been an invalid there
for thirty-eight years.
6 When Jesus saw him stretched out
by the pool and knew how long he had
been there, he said, "Do you want to get
well?"
7 The sick man said, "Sir, when the
water is s rred, I don't have anybody
to put me in the pool. By the me I get
there, somebody else is already in."
8 Jesus said, "Get up, take your bedroll,
start walking."JOHN 5

9 The man was healed on the spot. He
picked up his bedroll and walked oﬀ.
That day happened to be the Sabbath.
10 The Jews stopped the healed man
and said, "It's the Sabbath. You can't
carry your bedroll around. It's against
the rules."
11 But he told them, "The man who
made me well told me to. He said, 'Take
your bedroll and start walking.'"
12 They asked, "Who gave you the order
to take it up and start walking?"
13 But the healed man didn't know, for
Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.
14 A li le later Jesus found him in the
Temple and said, "You look wonderful!
You're well! Don't return to a sinning life
or something worse might happen."
15 The man went back and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had made him
well.JOHN 5
32
16 That is why the Jews were out to get
Jesus--because he did this kind of thing
on the Sabbath.
17 But Jesus defended himself. "My
Father is working straight through, even
on the Sabbath. So am I."
18 That really set them oﬀ. The Jews
were now not only out to expose him;
they were out to kill him. Not only
was he breaking the Sabbath, but he
was calling God his own Father, pu ng
himself on a level with God.
19 So Jesus explained himself at length.
"I'm telling you this straight. The Son
can't independently do a thing, only
what he sees the Father doing. What the
Father does, the Son does.
20 The Father loves the Son and includes
him in everything he is doing. "But you
haven't seen the half of it yet,
21 for in the same way that the Father
raises the dead and creates life, so doesJOHN 5
33
the Son. The Son gives life to anyone he
chooses.
22 Neither he nor the Father shuts
anyone out. The Father handed all
authority to judge over to the Son
23 so that the Son will be honored
equally with the Father. Anyone who
dishonors the Son, dishonors the Father,
for it was the Father's decision to put the
Son in the place of honor.
24 "It's urgent that you listen carefully
to this: Anyone here who believes what I
am saying right now and aligns himself
with the Father, who has in fact put me in
charge, has at this very moment the real,
las ng life and is no longer condemned
to be an outsider. This person has taken
a giant step from the world of the dead
to the world of the living.
25 "It's urgent that you get this right:
The me has arrived--I mean right
now!--when dead men and women willJOHN 5
34
hear the voice of the Son of God and,
hearing, will come alive.
26 Just as the Father has life in himself,
he has conferred on the Son life in
himself.
27 And he has given him the authority,
simply because he is the Son of Man,
to decide and carry out ma ers of
Judgment.
28 "Don't act so surprised at all this. The
me is coming when everyone dead and
buried will hear his voice.
29 Those who have lived the right way
will walk out into a resurrec on Life;
those who have lived the wrong way,
into a resurrec on Judgment.
30 "I can't do a solitary thing on my own:
I listen, then I decide. You can trust my
decision because I'm not out to get my
own way but only to carry out orders.JOHN 5
35
31 If I were simply speaking on my
own account, it would be an empty,
self-serving witness.
32 But an independent witness conﬁrms
me, the most reliable Witness of all.
33 Furthermore, you all saw and heard
John, and he gave expert and reliable
tes mony about me, didn't he?
34 "But my purpose is not to get your
vote, and not to appeal to mere human
tes mony. I'm speaking to you this way
so that you will be saved.
35 John was a torch, blazing and bright,
and you were glad enough to dance for
an hour or so in his bright light.
36 But the witness that really conﬁrms
me far exceeds John's witness. It's
the work the Father gave me to
complete. These very tasks, as I go
about comple ng them, conﬁrm that
the Father, in fact, sent me.JOHN 5
36
37 The Father who sent me, conﬁrmed
me. And you missed it. You never heard
his voice, you never saw his appearance.
38 There is nothing le in your memory
of his Message because you do not take
his Messenger seriously.
39 "You have your heads in your Bibles
constantly because you think you'll ﬁnd
eternal life there. But you miss the forest
for the trees. These Scriptures are all
about me!
40 And here I am, standing right before
you, and you aren't willing to receive
from me the life you say you want.
41 "I'm not interested in crowd approval.
42 And do you know why? Because I
know you and your crowds. I know that
love, especially God's love, is not on your
working agenda.
43 I came with the authority of my
Father, and you either dismiss me
or avoid me. If another came, ac ngJOHN 5 – 6
37
self-important, you would welcome him
with open arms.
44 How do you expect to get anywhere
with God when you spend all your me
jockeying for posi on with each other,
ranking your rivals and ignoring God?
45 "But don't think I'm going to accuse
you before my Father. Moses, in whom
you put so much stock, is your accuser.
46 If you believed, really believed, what
Moses said, you would believe me. He
wrote of me.
47 If you won't take seriously what he
wrote, how can I expect you to take
seriously what I speak?"
1 A er this, Jesus went across the
Sea of Galilee (some call it Tiberias).
2 A huge crowd followed him, a racted
by the miracles they had seen him do
among the sick.
6JOHN 6
38
3 When he got to the other side, he
climbed a hill and sat down, surrounded
by his disciples.
4 It was nearly me for the Feast of
Passover, kept annually by the Jews.
5 When Jesus looked out and saw that
a large crowd had arrived, he said to
Philip, "Where can we buy bread to feed
these people?"
6 He said this to stretch Philip's faith. He
already knew what he was going to do.
7 Philip answered, "Two hundred silver
pieces wouldn't be enough to buy bread
for each person to get a piece."
8 One of the disciples--it was Andrew,
brother to Simon Peter--said,
9 "There's a li le boy here who has ﬁve
barley loaves and two ﬁsh. But that's a
drop in the bucket for a crowd like this."
10 Jesus said, "Make the people sit
down." There was a nice carpet of greenJOHN 6
39
grass in this place. They sat down, about
ﬁve thousand of them.
11 Then Jesus took the bread and,
having given thanks, gave it to those
who were seated. He did the same with
the ﬁsh. All ate as much as they wanted.
12 When the people had eaten their
ﬁll, he said to his disciples, "Gather the
le overs so nothing is wasted."
13 They went to work and ﬁlled twelve
large baskets with le overs from the ﬁve
barley loaves.
14 The people realized that God was at
work among them in what Jesus had just
done. They said, "This is the Prophet
for sure, God's Prophet right here in
Galilee!"
15 Jesus saw that in their enthusiasm,
they were about to grab him and make
him king, so he slipped oﬀ and went
back up the mountain to be by himself.JOHN 6
40
16 In the evening his disciples went
down to the sea,
17 got in the boat, and headed back
across the water to Capernaum. It had
grown quite dark and Jesus had not yet
returned.
18 A huge wind blew up, churning the
sea.
19 They were maybe three or four miles
out when they saw Jesus walking on
the sea, quite near the boat. They were
scared senseless,
20 but he reassured them, "It's me. It's
all right. Don't be afraid."
21 So they took him on board. In no
me they reached land--the exact spot
they were headed to.
22 The next day the crowd that was le
behind realized that there had been only
one boat, and that Jesus had not go en
into it with his disciples. They had seen
them go oﬀ without him.JOHN 6
41
23 By now boats from Tiberias had
pulled up near where they had eaten the
bread blessed by the Master.
24 So when the crowd realized he was
gone and wasn't coming back, they piled
into the Tiberias boats and headed for
Capernaum, looking for Jesus.
25 When they found him back across
the sea, they said, "Rabbi, when did you
get here?"
26 Jesus answered, "You've come
looking for me not because you saw God
in my ac ons but because I fed you,
ﬁlled your stomachs--and for free.
27 "Don't waste your energy striving
for perishable food like that. Work for
the food that s cks with you, food that
nourishes your las ng life, food the Son
of Man provides. He and what he does
are guaranteed by God the Father to
last."JOHN 6
42
28 To that they said, "Well, what do we
do then to get in on God's works?"
29 Jesus said, "Throw your lot in with
the One that God has sent. That kind
of a commitment gets you in on God's
works."
30 They waﬄed: "Why don't you give us
a clue about who you are, just a hint of
what's going on? When we see what's
up, we'll commit ourselves. Show us
what you can do.
31 Moses fed our ancestors with bread
in the desert. It says so in the Scriptures:
'He gave them bread from heaven to
eat.'"
32 Jesus responded, "The real
signiﬁcance of that Scripture is not that
Moses gave you bread from heaven but
that my Father is right now oﬀering you
bread from heaven, the real bread.
33 The Bread of God came down out of
heaven and is giving life to the world."JOHN 6
43
34 They jumped at that: "Master, give us
this bread, now and forever!"
35 Jesus said, "I am the Bread of Life.
The person who aligns with me hungers
no more and thirsts no more, ever.
36 I have told you this explicitly because
even though you have seen me in ac on,
you don't really believe me.
37 Every person the Father gives me
eventually comes running to me. And
once that person is with me, I hold on
and don't let go.
38 I came down from heaven not to
follow my own whim but to accomplish
the will of the One who sent me.
39 "This, in a nutshell, is that will: that
everything handed over to me by the
Father be completed--not a single detail
missed--and at the wrap-up of me
I have everything and everyone put
together, upright and whole.JOHN 6
44
40 This is what my Father wants: that
anyone who sees the Son and trusts who
he is and what he does and then aligns
with him will enter real life, eternal life.
My part is to put them on their feet alive
and whole at the comple on of me."
41 At this, because he said, "I am the
Bread that came down from heaven,"
the Jews started arguing over him:
42 "Isn't this the son of Joseph? Don't
we know his father? Don't we know his
mother? How can he now say, 'I came
down out of heaven' and expect anyone
to believe him?"
43 Jesus said, "Don't bicker among
yourselves over me.
44 You're not in charge here. The Father
who sent me is in charge. He draws
people to me--that's the only way you'll
ever come. Only then do I do my work,
pu ng people together, se ng them on
their feet, ready for the End.JOHN 6
45
45 This is what the prophets meant
when they wrote, 'And then they will all
be personally taught by God.' Anyone
who has spent any me at all listening to
the Father, really listening and therefore
learning, comes to me to be taught
personally--to see it with his own eyes,
hear it with his own ears, from me, since
I have it ﬁrsthand from the Father.
46 No one has seen the Father except
the One who has his Being alongside the
Father--and you can see me.
47 "I'm telling you the most solemn and
sober truth now: Whoever believes in
me has real life, eternal life.
48 I am the Bread of Life.
49 Your ancestors ate the manna bread
in the desert and died.
50 But now here is Bread that truly
comes down out of heaven. Anyone
ea ng this Bread will not die, ever.JOHN 6
46
51 I am the Bread--living Bread!--who
came down out of heaven. Anyone who
eats this Bread will live--and forever!
The Bread that I present to the world
so that it can eat and live is myself, this
ﬂesh-and-blood self."
52 At this, the Jews started ﬁgh ng
among themselves: "How can this man
serve up his ﬂesh for a meal?"
53 But Jesus didn't give an inch. "Only
insofar as you eat and drink ﬂesh and
blood, the ﬂesh and blood of the Son of
Man, do you have life within you.
54 The one who brings a hearty appe te
to this ea ng and drinking has eternal
life and will be ﬁt and ready for the Final
Day.
55 My ﬂesh is real food and my blood is
real drink.
56 By ea ng my ﬂesh and drinking my
blood you enter into me and I into you.JOHN 6
47
57 In the same way that the fully alive
Father sent me here and I live because
of him, so the one who makes a meal of
me lives because of me.
58 This is the Bread from heaven.
Your ancestors ate bread and later
died. Whoever eats this Bread will live
always."
59 He said these things while teaching
in the mee ng place in Capernaum.
60 Many among his disciples heard this
and said, "This is tough teaching, too
tough to swallow."
61 Jesus sensed that his disciples were
having a hard me with this and said,
"Does this throw you completely?
62 What would happen if you saw the
Son of Man ascending to where he came
from?
63 The Spirit can make life. Sheer muscle
and willpower don't make anythingJOHN 6
48
happen. Every word I've spoken to you is
a Spirit-word, and so it is life-making.
64 But some of you are resis ng,
refusing to have any part in this." (Jesus
knew from the start that some weren't
going to risk themselves with him. He
knew also who would betray him.)
65 He went on to say, "This is why I told
you earlier that no one is capable of
coming to me on his own. You get to me
only as a gi from the Father."
66 A er this a lot of his disciples le .
They no longer wanted to be associated
with him.
67 Then Jesus gave the Twelve their
chance: "Do you also want to leave?"
68 Peter replied, "Master, to whom
would we go? You have the words of real
life, eternal life.
69 We've already commi ed ourselves,
conﬁdent that you are the Holy One of
God."JOHN 6 – 7
49
70 Jesus responded, "Haven't I
handpicked you, the Twelve? S ll, one of
you is a devil!"
71 He was referring to Judas, son of
Simon Iscariot. This man--one from the
Twelve!--was even then ge ng ready to
betray him.
1 Later Jesus was going about his
business in Galilee. He didn't want to
travel in Judea because the Jews there
were looking for a chance to kill him.
2 It was near the me of Tabernacles, a
feast observed annually by the Jews.
3 His brothers said, "Why don't you
leave here and go up to the Feast so
your disciples can get a good look at the
works you do?
4 No one who intends to be publicly
known does everything behind the
scenes. If you're serious about what you
are doing, come out in the open and
show the world."
7JOHN 7
50
5 His brothers were pushing him like
this because they didn't believe in him
either.
6 Jesus came back at them, "Don't
crowd me. This isn't my me. It's your
me--it's [always] your me; you have
nothing to lose.
7 The world has nothing against you,
but it's up in arms against me. It's against
me because I expose the evil behind its
pretensions.
8 You go ahead, go up to the Feast.
Don't wait for me. I'm not ready. It's not
the right me for me."
9 He said this and stayed on in Galilee.
10 But later, a er his family had gone
up to the Feast, he also went. But he
kept out of the way, careful not to draw
a en on to himself.
11 The Jews were already out looking
for him, asking around, "Where is that
man?"JOHN 7
12 There was a lot of conten
51
ous
talk about him circula ng through the
crowds. Some were saying, "He's a good
man." But others said, "Not so. He's
selling snake oil."
13 This kind of talk went on in guarded
whispers because of the in mida ng
Jewish leaders.
14 With the Feast already half over,
Jesus showed up in the Temple, teaching.
15 The Jews were impressed, but
puzzled: "How does he know so much
without being schooled?"
16 Jesus said, "I didn't make this up.
What I teach comes from the One who
sent me.
17 Anyone who wants to do his will can
test this teaching and know whether it's
from God or whether I'm making it up.
18 A person making things up tries to
make himself look good. But someone
trying to honor the one who sent himJOHN 7
52
s cks to the facts and doesn't tamper
with reality.
19 It was Moses, wasn't it, who gave you
God's Law? But none of you are living it.
So why are you trying to kill me?"
20 The crowd said, "You're crazy!
Who's trying to kill you? You're
demon-possessed."
21 Jesus said, "I did one miraculous
thing a few months ago, and you're
s ll standing around ge ng all upset,
wondering what I'm up to.
22 Moses prescribed circumcision-
-originally it came not from Moses
but from his ancestors--and so you
circumcise a man, dealing with one part
of his body, even if it's the Sabbath.
23 You do this in order to preserve one
item in the Law of Moses. So why are
you upset with me because I made a
man's whole body well on the Sabbath?JOHN 7
53
24 Don't be nitpickers; use your head--
and heart!--to discern what is right, to
test what is authen cally right."
25 That's when some of the people of
Jerusalem said, "Isn't this the one they
were out to kill?
26 And here he is out in the open, saying
whatever he pleases, and no one is
stopping him. Could it be that the rulers
know that he is, in fact, the Messiah?
27 And yet we know where this man
came from. The Messiah is going to
come out of nowhere. Nobody is going
to know where he comes from."
28 That provoked Jesus, who was
teaching in the Temple, to cry out, "Yes,
you think you know me and where I'm
from, but that's not where I'm from. I
didn't set myself up in business. My true
origin is in the One who sent me, and
you don't know him at all.JOHN 7
54
29 I come from him--that's how I know
him. He sent me here."
30 They were looking for a way to arrest
him, but not a hand was laid on him
because it wasn't yet God's me.
31 Many from the crowd commi ed
themselves in faith to him, saying, "Will
the Messiah, when he comes, provide
be er or more convincing evidence than
this?"
32 The Pharisees, alarmed at this
sedi ous undertow going through the
crowd, teamed up with the high priests
and sent their police to arrest him.
33 Jesus rebuﬀed them: "I am with you
only a short me. Then I go on to the
One who sent me.
34 You will look for me, but you won't
ﬁnd me. Where I am, you can't come."
35 The Jews put their heads together.
"Where do you think he is going that we
won't be able to ﬁnd him? Do you thinkJOHN 7
55
he is about to travel to the Greek world
to teach the Jews?
36 What is he talking about, anyway:
'You will look for me, but you won't ﬁnd
me,' and 'Where I am, you can't come'?"
37 On the ﬁnal and climac c day of the
Feast, Jesus took his stand. He cried out,
"If anyone thirsts, let him come to me
and drink.
38 Rivers of living water will brim and
spill out of the depths of anyone who
believes in me this way, just as the
Scripture says."
39 (He said this in regard to the Spirit,
whom those who believed in him were
about to receive. The Spirit had not yet
been given because Jesus had not yet
been gloriﬁed.)
40 Those in the crowd who heard these
words were saying, "This has to be the
Prophet."JOHN 7
56
41 Others said, "He is the Messiah!"
But others were saying, "The Messiah
doesn't come from Galilee, does he?
42 Don't the Scriptures tell us that the
Messiah comes from David's line and
from Bethlehem, David's village?"
43 So there was a split in the crowd over
him.
44 Some went so far as wan ng to arrest
him, but no one laid a hand on him.
45 That's when the Temple police
reported back to the high priests and
Pharisees, who demanded, "Why didn't
you bring him with you?"
46 The police answered, "Have you
heard the way he talks? We've never
heard anyone speak like this man."
47 The Pharisees said, "Are you carried
away like the rest of the rabble?
48 You don't see any of the leaders
believing in him, do you? Or any from
the Pharisees?JOHN 7 – 8
57
49 It's only this crowd, ignorant of
God's Law, that is taken in by him--and
damned."
50 Nicodemus, the man who had come
to Jesus earlier and was both a ruler and
a Pharisee, spoke up.
51 "Does our Law decide about a man's
guilt without ﬁrst listening to him and
ﬁnding out what he is doing?"
52 But they cut him oﬀ. "Are you also
campaigning for the Galilean?
53 Examine the evidence. See if any
prophet ever comes from Galilee." Then
they all went home.
1 Jesus went across to Mount Olives,
2 but he was soon back in the
Temple again. Swarms of people came to
him. He sat down and taught them.
3 The religion scholars and Pharisees
led in a woman who had been caught
in an act of adultery. They stood her in
plain sight of everyone
8JOHN 8
58
4 and said, "Teacher, this woman was
caught red-handed in the act of adultery.
5 Moses, in the Law, gives orders to
stone such persons. What do you say?"
6 They were trying to trap him into
saying something incrimina ng so they
could bring charges against him. Jesus
bent down and wrote with his ﬁnger in
the dirt.
7 They kept at him, badgering him. He
straightened up and said, "The sinless
one among you, go ﬁrst: Throw the
stone."
8 Bending down again, he wrote some
more in the dirt.
9 Hearing that, they walked away, one
a er another, beginning with the oldest.
The woman was le alone.
10 Jesus stood up and spoke to her.
"Woman, where are they? Does no one
condemn you?"JOHN 8
59
11 "No one, Master." "Neither do I," said
Jesus. "Go on your way. From now on,
don't sin."
12 Jesus once again addressed them:
"I am the world's Light. No one who
follows me stumbles around in the
darkness. I provide plenty of light to live
in."
13 The Pharisees objected, "All we have
is your word on this. We need more than
this to go on."
14 Jesus replied, "You're right that you
only have my word. But you can depend
on it being true. I know where I've come
from and where I go next. You don't
know where I'm from or where I'm
headed.
15 You decide according to what you can
see and touch. I don't make judgments
like that.
16 But even if I did, my judgment would
be true because I wouldn't make it outJOHN 8
60
of the narrowness of my experience but
in the largeness of the One who sent me,
the Father.
17 That fulﬁlls the condi ons set down
in God's Law: that you can count on the
tes mony of two witnesses.
18 And that is what you have: You have
my word and you have the word of the
Father who sent me."
19 They said, "Where is this so-called
Father of yours?" Jesus said, "You're
looking right at me and you don't see
me. How do you expect to see the
Father? If you knew me, you would at
the same me know the Father."
20 He gave this speech in the Treasury
while teaching in the Temple. No one
arrested him because his me wasn't yet
up.
21 Then he went over the same ground
again. "I'm leaving and you are going
to look for me, but you're missing GodJOHN 8
61
in this and are headed for a dead end.
There is no way you can come with me."
22 The Jews said, "So, is he going to kill
himself? Is that what he means by 'You
can't come with me'?"
23 Jesus said, "You're ed down to the
mundane; I'm in touch with what is
beyond your horizons. You live in terms
of what you see and touch. I'm living on
other terms.
24 I told you that you were missing God
in all this. You're at a dead end. If you
won't believe I am who I say I am, you're
at the dead end of sins. You're missing
God in your lives."
25 They said to him, "Just who are you
anyway?" Jesus said, "What I've said
from the start.
26 I have so many things to say that
concern you, judgments to make that
aﬀect you, but if you don't accept
the trustworthiness of the One whoJOHN 8
62
commanded my words and acts, none
of it ma ers. That is who you are
ques oning--not me but the One who
sent me."
27 They s ll didn't get it, didn't realize
that he was referring to the Father.
28 So Jesus tried again. "When you
raise up the Son of Man, then you will
know who I am--that I'm not making this
up, but speaking only what the Father
taught me.
29 The One who sent me stays with me.
He doesn't abandon me. He sees how
much joy I take in pleasing him."
30 When he put it in these terms, many
people decided to believe.
31 Then Jesus turned to the Jews who
had claimed to believe in him. "If you
s ck with this, living out what I tell you,
you are my disciples for sure.JOHN 8
63
32 Then you will experience for
yourselves the truth, and the truth will
free you."
33 Surprised, they said, "But we're
descendants of Abraham. We've never
been slaves to anyone. How can you say,
'The truth will free you'?"
34 Jesus said, "I tell you most solemnly
that anyone who chooses a life of sin is
trapped in a dead-end life and is, in fact,
a slave.
35 A slave is a transient, who can't come
and go at will. The Son, though, has
an established posi on, the run of the
house.
36 So if the Son sets you free, you are
free through and through.
37 I know you are Abraham's
descendants. But I also know that
you are trying to kill me because my
message hasn't yet penetrated your
thick skulls.JOHN 8
64
38 I'm talking about things I have seen
while keeping company with the Father,
and you just go on doing what you have
heard from your father."
39 They were indignant. "Our father
is Abraham!" Jesus said, "If you were
Abraham's children, you would have
been doing the things Abraham did.
40 And yet here you are trying to kill
me, a man who has spoken to you the
truth he got straight from God! Abraham
never did that sort of thing.
41 You persist in repea ng the works
of your father." They said, "We're not
bastards. We have a legi mate father:
the one and only God."
42 "If God was your father," said Jesus,
"you would love me, for I came from
God and arrived here. I didn't come on
my own. He sent me.
43 Why can't you understand one word
I say? Here's why: You can't handle it.JOHN 8
65
44 You're from your father, the Devil,
and all you want to do is please him.
He was a killer from the very start. He
couldn't stand the truth because there
wasn't a shred of truth in him. When the
Liar speaks, he makes it up out of his
lying nature and ﬁlls the world with lies.
45 I arrive on the scene, tell you the
plain truth, and you refuse to have a
thing to do with me.
46 Can any one of you convict me of a
single misleading word, a single sinful
act? But if I'm telling the truth, why don't
you believe me?
47 Anyone on God's side listens to
God's words. This is why you're not
listening--because you're not on God's
side."
48 The Jews then said, "That clinches it.
We were right all along when we called
you a Samaritan and said you were
crazy--demon-possessed!"JOHN 8
66
49 Jesus said, "I'm not crazy. I simply
honor my Father, while you dishonor
me.
50 I am not trying to get anything for
myself. God intends something gloriously
grand here and is making the decisions
that will bring it about.
51 I say this with absolute conﬁdence. If
you prac ce what I'm telling you, you'll
never have to look death in the face."
52 At this point the Jews said, "Now we
know you're crazy. Abraham died. The
prophets died. And you show up saying,
'If you prac ce what I'm telling you,
you'll never have to face death, not even
a taste.'
53 Are you greater than Abraham, who
died? And the prophets died! Who do
you think you are!"
54 Jesus said, "If I turned the spotlight
on myself, it wouldn't amount to
anything. But my Father, the same OneJOHN 8 – 9
67
you say is your Father, put me here at
this me and place of splendor.
55 You haven't recognized him in this.
But I have. If I, in false modesty, said I
didn't know what was going on, I would
be as much of a liar as you are. But I do
know, and I am doing what he says.
56 Abraham--your 'father'--with jubilant
faith looked down the corridors of
history and saw my day coming. He saw
it and cheered."
57 The Jews said, "You're not even ﬁ y
years old--and Abraham saw you?"
58 "Believe me," said Jesus, "I am who I
am long before Abraham was anything."
59 That did it--pushed them over the
edge. They picked up rocks to throw at
him. But Jesus slipped away, ge ng out
of the Temple.
1 Walking down the street, Jesus saw
a man blind from birth.
9JOHN 9
68
2 His disciples asked, "Rabbi, who
sinned: this man or his parents, causing
him to be born blind?"
3 Jesus said, "You're asking the wrong
ques on. You're looking for someone
to blame. There is no such cause-eﬀect
here. Look instead for what God can do.
4 We need to be energe cally at work
for the One who sent me here, working
while the sun shines. When night falls,
the workday is over.
5 For as long as I am in the world, there
is plenty of light. I am the world's Light."
6 He said this and then spit in the dust,
made a clay paste with the saliva, rubbed
the paste on the blind man's eyes,
7 and said, "Go, wash at the Pool of
Siloam" (Siloam means "Sent"). The man
went and washed--and saw.
8 Soon the town was buzzing. His
rela ves and those who year a er year
had seen him as a blind man beggingJOHN 9
69
were saying, "Why, isn't this the man we
knew, who sat here and begged?"
9 Others said, "It's him all right!" But
others objected, "It's not the same man
at all. It just looks like him." He said, "It's
me, the very one."
10 They said, "How did your eyes get
opened?"
11 "A man named Jesus made a paste
and rubbed it on my eyes and told me,
'Go to Siloam and wash.' I did what he
said. When I washed, I saw."
12 "So where is he?" "I don't know."
13 They marched the man to the
Pharisees.
14 This day when Jesus made the
paste and healed his blindness was the
Sabbath.
15 The Pharisees grilled him again
on how he had come to see. He said,
"He put a clay paste on my eyes, and I
washed, and now I see."JOHN 9
70
16 Some of the Pharisees said,
"Obviously, this man can't be from God.
He doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others
countered, "How can a bad man do
miraculous, God-revealing things like
this?" There was a split in their ranks.
17 They came back at the blind man,
"You're the expert. He opened your eyes.
What do you say about him?" He said,
"He is a prophet."
18 The Jews didn't believe it, didn't
believe the man was blind to begin with.
So they called the parents of the man
now bright-eyed with sight.
19 They asked them, "Is this your son,
the one you say was born blind? So how
is it that he now sees?"
20 His parents said, "We know he is our
son, and we know he was born blind.
21 But we don't know how he came to
see--haven't a clue about who openedJOHN 9
71
his eyes. Why don't you ask him? He's a
grown man and can speak for himself."
22 (His parents were talking like this
because they were in midated by the
Jewish leaders, who had already decided
that anyone who took a stand that this
was the Messiah would be kicked out of
the mee ng place.
23 That's why his parents said, "Ask him.
He's a grown man.")
24 They called the man back a second
me--the man who had been blind--and
told him, "Give credit to God. We know
this man is an impostor."
25 He replied, "I know nothing about
that one way or the other. But I know
one thing for sure: I was blind...I now
see."
26 They said, "What did he do to you?
How did he open your eyes?"
27 "I've told you over and over and
you haven't listened. Why do you wantJOHN 9
72
to hear it again? Are you so eager to
become his disciples?"
28 With that they jumped all over him.
"You might be a disciple of that man, but
we're disciples of Moses.
29 We know for sure that God spoke to
Moses, but we have no idea where this
man even comes from."
30 The man replied, "This is amazing!
You claim to know nothing about him,
but the fact is, he opened my eyes!
31 It's well known that God isn't
at the beck and call of sinners, but
listens carefully to anyone who lives in
reverence and does his will.
32 That someone opened the eyes of a
man born blind has never been heard
of--ever.
33 If this man didn't come from God, he
wouldn't be able to do anything."JOHN 9
73
34 They said, "You're nothing but dirt!
How dare you take that tone with us!"
Then they threw him out in the street.
35 Jesus heard that they had thrown
him out, and went and found him. He
asked him, "Do you believe in the Son of
Man?"
36 The man said, "Point him out to me,
sir, so that I can believe in him."
37 Jesus said, "You're looking right at
him. Don't you recognize my voice?"
38 "Master, I believe," the man said, and
worshiped him.
39 Jesus then said, "I came into the
world to bring everything into the clear
light of day, making all the dis nc ons
clear, so that those who have never seen
will see, and those who have made a
great pretense of seeing will be exposed
as blind."JOHN 9 – 10
74
40 Some Pharisees overheard him and
said, "Does that mean you're calling us
blind?"
41 Jesus said, "If you were really blind,
you would be blameless, but since you
claim to see everything so well, you're
accountable for every fault and failure.
1 "Let me set this before you as
plainly as I can. If a person climbs
over or through the fence of a sheep
pen instead of going through the gate,
you know he's up to no good--a sheep
rustler!
2 The shepherd walks right up to the
gate.
3 The gatekeeper opens the gate to him
and the sheep recognize his voice. He
calls his own sheep by name and leads
them out.
4 When he gets them all out, he leads
them and they follow because they are
familiar with his voice.
10JOHN 10
75
5 They won't follow a stranger's voice
but will sca er because they aren't used
to the sound of it."
6 Jesus told this simple story, but they
had no idea what he was talking about.
7 So he tried again. "I'll be explicit, then.
I am the Gate for the sheep.
8 All those others are up to no good--
sheep stealers, every one of them. But
the sheep didn't listen to them.
9 I am the Gate. Anyone who goes
through me will be cared for--will freely
go in and out, and ﬁnd pasture.
10 A thief is only there to steal and kill
and destroy. I came so they can have
real and eternal life, more and be er life
than they ever dreamed of.
11 "I am the Good Shepherd. The Good
Shepherd puts the sheep before himself,
sacriﬁces himself if necessary.
12 A hired man is not a real shepherd.
The sheep mean nothing to him. He seesJOHN 10
76
a wolf come and runs for it, leaving the
sheep to be ravaged and sca ered by
the wolf.
13 He's only in it for the money. The
sheep don't ma er to him.
14 "I am the Good Shepherd. I know my
own sheep and my own sheep know me.
15 In the same way, the Father knows
me and I know the Father. I put the
sheep before myself, sacriﬁcing myself if
necessary.
16 You need to know that I have other
sheep in addi on to those in this pen.
I need to gather and bring them, too.
They'll also recognize my voice. Then it
will be one ﬂock, one Shepherd.
17 This is why the Father loves me:
because I freely lay down my life. And so
I am free to take it up again.
18 No one takes it from me. I lay it down
of my own free will. I have the right
to lay it down; I also have the right toJOHN 10
77
take it up again. I received this authority
personally from my Father."
19 This kind of talk caused another split
in the Jewish ranks.
20 A lot of them were saying, "He's crazy,
a maniac--out of his head completely.
Why bother listening to him?"
21 But others weren't so sure: "These
aren't the words of a crazy man. Can a
'maniac' open blind eyes?"
22 They were celebra ng Hanukkah just
then in Jerusalem. It was winter.
23 Jesus was strolling in the Temple
across Solomon's Porch.
24 The Jews, circling him, said, "How
long are you going to keep us guessing?
If you're the Messiah, tell us straight
out."
25 Jesus answered, "I told you, but you
don't believe. Everything I have done has
been authorized by my Father, ac ons
that speak louder than words.JOHN 10
78
26 You don't believe because you're not
my sheep.
27 My sheep recognize my voice. I know
them, and they follow me.
28 I give them real and eternal life. They
are protected from the Destroyer for
good. No one can steal them from out of
my hand.
29 The Father who put them under
my care is so much greater than the
Destroyer and Thief. No one could ever
get them away from him.
30 I and the Father are one heart and
mind."
31 Again the Jews picked up rocks to
throw at him.
32 Jesus said, "I have made a present
to you from the Father of a great many
good ac ons. For which of these acts do
you stone me?"
33 The Jews said, "We're not stoning
you for anything good you did, but forJOHN 10
79
what you said--this blasphemy of calling
yourself God."
34 Jesus said, "I'm only quo ng your
inspired Scriptures, where God said, 'I
tell you--you are gods.'
35 If God called your ancestors
'gods'--and Scripture doesn't lie--
36 why do you yell, 'Blasphemer!
Blasphemer!' at the unique One the
Father consecrated and sent into the
world, just because I said, 'I am the Son
of God'?
37 If I don't do the things my Father
does, well and good; don't believe me.
38 But if I am doing them, put aside for
a moment what you hear me say about
myself and just take the evidence of the
ac ons that are right before your eyes.
Then perhaps things will come together
for you, and you'll see that not only are
we doing the same thing, we are theJOHN 10 – 11
80
same--Father and Son. He is in me; I am
in him."
39 They tried yet again to arrest him,
but he slipped through their ﬁngers.
40 He went back across the Jordan to
the place where John ﬁrst bap zed, and
stayed there.
41 A lot of people followed him over.
They were saying, "John did no miracles,
but everything he said about this man
has come true."
42 Many believed in him then and there.
1 A man was sick, Lazarus of
Bethany, the town of Mary and
her sister Martha.
2 This was the same Mary who
massaged the Lord's feet with aroma c
oils and then wiped them with her hair.
It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.
3 So the sisters sent word to Jesus,
"Master, the one you love so very much
is sick."
11JOHN 11
81
4 When Jesus got the message, he said,
"This sickness is not fatal. It will become
an occasion to show God's glory by
glorifying God's Son."
5 Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus,
6 but oddly, when he heard that Lazarus
was sick, he stayed on where he was for
two more days.
7 A er the two days, he said to his
disciples, "Let's go back to Judea."
8 They said, "Rabbi, you can't do that.
The Jews are out to kill you, and you're
going back?"
9 Jesus replied, "Are there not twelve
hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in
daylight doesn't stumble because there's
plenty of light from the sun.
10 Walking at night, he might very well
stumble because he can't see where he's
going."JOHN 11
82
11 He said these things, and then
announced, "Our friend Lazarus has
fallen asleep. I'm going to wake him up."
12 The disciples said, "Master, if he's
gone to sleep, he'll get a good rest and
wake up feeling ﬁne."
13 Jesus was talking about death, while
his disciples thought he was talking
about taking a nap.
14 Then Jesus became explicit: "Lazarus
died.
15 And I am glad for your sakes that I
wasn't there. You're about to be given
new grounds for believing. Now let's go
to him."
16 That's when Thomas, the one called
the Twin, said to his companions, "Come
along. We might as well die with him."
17 When Jesus ﬁnally got there, he
found Lazarus already four days dead.
18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, only a
couple of miles away,JOHN 11
19 and many of the Jews were visi
83
ng
Martha and Mary, sympathizing with
them over their brother.
20 Martha heard Jesus was coming and
went out to meet him. Mary remained in
the house.
21 Martha said, "Master, if you'd been
here, my brother wouldn't have died.
22 Even now, I know that whatever you
ask God he will give you."
23 Jesus said, "Your brother will be
raised up."
24 Martha replied, "I know that he will
be raised up in the resurrec on at the
end of me."
25 "You don't have to wait for the End. I
am, right now, Resurrec on and Life. The
one who believes in me, even though he
or she dies, will live.
26 And everyone who lives believing in
me does not ul mately die at all. Do you
believe this?"JOHN 11
84
27 "Yes, Master. All along I have believed
that you are the Messiah, the Son of God
who comes into the world."
28 A er saying this, she went to her
sister Mary and whispered in her ear,
"The Teacher is here and is asking for
you."
29 The moment she heard that, she
jumped up and ran out to him.
30 Jesus had not yet entered the town
but was s ll at the place where Martha
had met him.
31 When her sympathizing Jewish
friends saw Mary run oﬀ, they followed
her, thinking she was on her way to the
tomb to weep there.
32 Mary came to where Jesus was
wai ng and fell at his feet, saying,
"Master, if only you had been here, my
brother would not have died."JOHN 11
85
33 When Jesus saw her sobbing and the
Jews with her sobbing, a deep anger
welled up within him.
34 He said, "Where did you put him?"
"Master, come and see," they said.
35 Now Jesus wept.
36 The Jews said, "Look how deeply he
loved him."
37 Others among them said, "Well, if
he loved him so much, why didn't he
do something to keep him from dying?
A er all, he opened the eyes of a blind
man."
38 Then Jesus, the anger again welling
up within him, arrived at the tomb. It
was a simple cave in the hillside with a
slab of stone laid against it.
39 Jesus said, "Remove the stone." The
sister of the dead man, Martha, said,
"Master, by this me there's a stench.
He's been dead four days!"JOHN 11
86
40 Jesus looked her in the eye. "Didn't I
tell you that if you believed, you would
see the glory of God?"
41 Then, to the others, "Go ahead, take
away the stone." They removed the
stone. Jesus raised his eyes to heaven
and prayed, "Father, I'm grateful that
you have listened to me.
42 I know you always do listen, but on
account of this crowd standing here I've
spoken so that they might believe that
you sent me."
43 Then he shouted, "Lazarus, come
out!"
44 And he came out, a cadaver, wrapped
from head to toe, and with a kerchief
over his face. Jesus told them, "Unwrap
him and let him loose."
45 That was a turnaround for many of
the Jews who were with Mary. They saw
what Jesus did, and believed in him.JOHN 11
87
46 But some went back to the Pharisees
and told on Jesus.
47 The high priests and Pharisees called
a mee ng of the Jewish ruling body.
"What do we do now?" they asked. "This
man keeps on doing things, crea ng
God-signs.
48 If we let him go on, pre y soon
everyone will be believing in him and
the Romans will come and remove what
li le power and privilege we s ll have."
49 Then one of them--it was Caiaphas,
the designated Chief Priest that
year--spoke up, "Don't you know
anything?
50 Can't you see that it's to our
advantage that one man dies for the
people rather than the whole na on be
destroyed?"
51 He didn't say this of his own
accord, but as Chief Priest that year heJOHN 11
88
unwi ngly prophesied that Jesus was
about to die sacriﬁcially for the na on,
52 and not only for the na on but so
that all God's exile-sca ered children
might be gathered together into one
people.
53 From that day on, they plo ed to kill
him.
54 So Jesus no longer went out in public
among the Jews. He withdrew into the
country bordering the desert to a town
called Ephraim and secluded himself
there with his disciples.
55 The Jewish Passover was coming up.
Crowds of people were making their way
from the country up to Jerusalem to get
themselves ready for the Feast.
56 They were curious about Jesus. There
was a lot of talk of him among those
standing around in the Temple: "What
do you think? Do you think he'll show up
at the Feast or not?"JOHN 11 – 12
89
57 Meanwhile, the high priests and
Pharisees gave out the word that anyone
ge ng wind of him should inform them.
They were all set to arrest him.
1 Six days before Passover, Jesus
entered Bethany where Lazarus,
so recently raised from the dead, was
living.
2 Lazarus and his sisters invited Jesus to
dinner at their home. Martha served.
Lazarus was one of those si ng at the
table with them.
3 Mary came in with a jar of very
expensive aroma c oils, anointed and
massaged Jesus' feet, and then wiped
them with her hair. The fragrance of the
oils ﬁlled the house.
4 Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples,
even then ge ng ready to betray him,
said,
5 "Why wasn't this oil sold and the
money given to the poor? It would have
12JOHN 12
90
easily brought three hundred silver
pieces."
6 He said this not because he cared two
cents about the poor but because he
was a thief. He was in charge of their
common funds, but also embezzled
them.
7 Jesus said, "Let her alone. She's
an cipa ng and honoring the day of my
burial.
8 You always have the poor with you.
You don't always have me."
9 Word got out among the Jews that he
was back in town. The people came to
take a look, not only at Jesus but also at
Lazarus, who had been raised from the
dead.
10 So the high priests plo ed to kill
Lazarus
11 because so many of the Jews were
going over and believing in Jesus on
account of him.JOHN 12
91
12 The next day the huge crowd that
had arrived for the Feast heard that
Jesus was entering Jerusalem.
13 They broke oﬀ palm branches and
went out to meet him. And they cheered:
Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in
God's name! Yes! The King of Israel!
14 Jesus got a young donkey and rode it,
just as the Scripture has it:
15 No fear, Daughter Zion: See how your
king comes, riding a donkey's colt.
16 The disciples didn't no ce the
fulﬁllment of many Scriptures at the
me, but a er Jesus was gloriﬁed, they
remembered that what was wri en
about him matched what was done to
him.
17 The crowd that had been with him
when he called Lazarus from the tomb,
raising him from the dead, was there
giving eyewitness accounts.JOHN 12
92
18 It was because they had spread the
word of this latest God-sign that the
crowd swelled to a welcoming parade.
19 The Pharisees took one look and
threw up their hands: "It's out of control.
The world's in a stampede a er him."
20 There were some Greeks in town
who had come up to worship at the
Feast.
21 They approached Philip, who was
from Bethsaida in Galilee: "Sir, we want
to see Jesus. Can you help us?"
22 Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew
and Philip together told Jesus.
23 Jesus answered, "Time's up. The
me has come for the Son of Man to be
gloriﬁed.
24 "Listen carefully: Unless a grain of
wheat is buried in the ground, dead to
the world, it is never any more than
a grain of wheat. But if it is buried, itJOHN 12
93
sprouts and reproduces itself many
mes over.
25 In the same way, anyone who holds
on to life just as it is destroys that life.
But if you let it go, reckless in your love,
you'll have it forever, real and eternal.
26 "If any of you wants to serve me,
then follow me. Then you'll be where
I am, ready to serve at a moment's
no ce. The Father will honor and reward
anyone who serves me.
27 "Right now I am storm-tossed. And
what am I going to say? 'Father, get me
out of this'? No, this is why I came in the
ﬁrst place.
28 I'll say, 'Father, put your glory on
display.'" A voice came out of the sky: "I
have gloriﬁed it, and I'll glorify it again."
29 The listening crowd said, "Thunder!"
Others said, "An angel spoke to him!"
30 Jesus said, "The voice didn't come for
me but for you.JOHN 12
94
31 At this moment the world is in crisis.
Now Satan, the ruler of this world, will
be thrown out.
32 And I, as I am li ed up from the
earth, will a ract everyone to me and
gather them around me."
33 He put it this way to show how he
was going to be put to death.
34 Voices from the crowd answered,
"We heard from God's Law that the
Messiah lasts forever. How can it be
necessary, as you put it, that the Son of
Man 'be li ed up'? Who is this 'Son of
Man'?"
35 Jesus said, "For a brief me s ll, the
light is among you. Walk by the light you
have so darkness doesn't destroy you.
If you walk in darkness, you don't know
where you're going.
36 As you have the light, believe in the
light. Then the light will be within you,
and shining through your lives. You'll beJOHN 12
95
children of light." Jesus said all this, and
then went into hiding.
37 All these God-signs he had given
them and they s ll didn't get it, s ll
wouldn't trust him.
38 This proved that the prophet Isaiah
was right: God, who believed what we
preached? Who recognized God's arm,
outstretched and ready to act?
39 First they wouldn't believe, then they
couldn't--again, just as Isaiah said:
40 Their eyes are blinded, their hearts
are hardened, So that they wouldn't see
with their eyes and perceive with their
hearts, And turn to me, God, so I could
heal them.
41 Isaiah said these things a er he got
a glimpse of God's cascading brightness
that would pour through the Messiah.
42 On the other hand, a considerable
number from the ranks of the leaders did
believe. But because of the Pharisees,JOHN 12
96
they didn't come out in the open with it.
They were afraid of ge ng kicked out of
the mee ng place.
43 When push came to shove they cared
more for human approval than for God's
glory.
44 Jesus summed it all up when he cried
out, "Whoever believes in me, believes
not just in me but in the One who sent
me.
45 Whoever looks at me is looking, in
fact, at the One who sent me.
46 I am Light that has come into the
world so that all who believe in me won't
have to stay any longer in the dark.
47 "If anyone hears what I am saying
and doesn't take it seriously, I don't
reject him. I didn't come to reject the
world;
48 I came to save the world. But you
need to know that whoever puts me oﬀ,
refusing to take in what I'm saying, isJOHN 12 – 13
97
willfully choosing rejec on. The Word,
the Word-made-ﬂesh that I have spoken
and that I am, that Word and no other is
the last word.
49 I'm not making any of this up on my
own. The Father who sent me gave me
orders, told me what to say and how to
say it.
50 And I know exactly what his
command produces: real and eternal
life. That's all I have to say. What the
Father told me, I tell you."
1 Just before the Passover Feast,
Jesus knew that the me had
come to leave this world to go to
the Father. Having loved his dear
companions, he con nued to love them
right to the end.
2 It was supper me. The Devil by now
had Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot,
ﬁrmly in his grip, all set for the betrayal.
13JOHN 13
98
3 Jesus knew that the Father had put
him in complete charge of everything,
that he came from God and was on his
way back to God.
4 So he got up from the supper table,
set aside his robe, and put on an apron.
5 Then he poured water into a basin and
began to wash the feet of the disciples,
drying them with his apron.
6 When he got to Simon Peter, Peter
said, "Master, you wash my feet?"
7 Jesus answered, "You don't
understand now what I'm doing,
but it will be clear enough to you later."
8 Peter persisted, "You're not going
to wash my feet--ever!" Jesus said, "If
I don't wash you, you can't be part of
what I'm doing."
9 "Master!" said Peter. "Not only my
feet, then. Wash my hands! Wash my
head!"JOHN 13
99
10 Jesus said, "If you've had a bath in
the morning, you only need your feet
washed now and you're clean from head
to toe. My concern, you understand, is
holiness, not hygiene. So now you're
clean. But not every one of you."
11 (He knew who was betraying him.
That's why he said, "Not every one of
you.")
12 A er he had ﬁnished washing their
feet, he took his robe, put it back on,
and went back to his place at the table.
Then he said, "Do you understand what I
have done to you?
13 You address me as 'Teacher' and
'Master,' and rightly so. That is what I
am.
14 So if I, the Master and Teacher,
washed your feet, you must now wash
each other's feet.
15 I've laid down a pa ern for you.
What I've done, you do.JOHN 13
16 I'm only poin
100
ng out the obvious. A
servant is not ranked above his master;
an employee doesn't give orders to the
employer.
17 If you understand what I'm telling
you, act like it--and live a blessed life.
18 "I'm not including all of you in this. I
know precisely whom I've selected, so
as not to interfere with the fulﬁllment of
this Scripture: The one who ate bread at
my table Turned on his heel against me.
19 "I'm telling you all this ahead of me
so that when it happens you will believe
that I am who I say I am.
20 Make sure you get this right:
Receiving someone I send is the same
as receiving me, just as receiving me is
the same as receiving the One who sent
me."
21 A er he said these things, Jesus
became visibly upset, and then he toldJOHN 13
101
them why. "One of you is going to betray
me."
22 The disciples looked around at one
another, wondering who on earth he
was talking about.
23 One of the disciples, the one Jesus
loved dearly, was reclining against him,
his head on his shoulder.
24 Peter mo oned to him to ask who
Jesus might be talking about.
25 So, being the closest, he said,
"Master, who?"
26 Jesus said, "The one to whom I give
this crust of bread a er I've dipped it."
Then he dipped the crust and gave it to
Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot.
27 As soon as the bread was in his hand,
Satan entered him. "What you must do,"
said Jesus, "do. Do it and get it over
with."
28 No one around the supper table
knew why he said this to him.JOHN 13
102
29 Some thought that since Judas was
their treasurer, Jesus was telling him to
buy what they needed for the Feast, or
that he should give something to the
poor.
30 Judas, with the piece of bread, le . It
was night.
31 When he had le , Jesus said, "Now
the Son of Man is seen for who he is,
and God seen for who he is in him. The
moment God is seen in him,
32 God's glory will be on display. In
glorifying him, he himself is gloriﬁed--
glory all around!
33 "Children, I am with you for only a
short me longer. You are going to look
high and low for me. But just as I told
the Jews, I'm telling you: 'Where I go,
you are not able to come.'
34 "Let me give you a new command:
Love one another. In the same way I
loved you, you love one another.JOHN 13 – 14
103
35 This is how everyone will recognize
that you are my disciples--when they see
the love you have for each other."
36 Simon Peter asked, "Master, just
where are you going?" Jesus answered,
"You can't now follow me where I'm
going. You will follow later."
37 "Master," said Peter, "why can't I
follow now? I'll lay down my life for
you!"
38 "Really? You'll lay down your life for
me? The truth is that before the rooster
crows, you'll deny me three mes."
1 "Don't let this throw you. You
trust God, don't you? Trust me.
2 There is plenty of room for you in my
Father's home. If that weren't so, would
I have told you that I'm on my way to get
a room ready for you?
3 And if I'm on my way to get your room
ready, I'll come back and get you so you
can live where I live.
14JOHN 14
104
4 And you already know the road I'm
taking."
5 Thomas said, "Master, we have no
idea where you're going. How do you
expect us to know the road?"
6 Jesus said, "I am the Road, also the
Truth, also the Life. No one gets to the
Father apart from me.
7 If you really knew me, you would
know my Father as well. From now on,
you do know him. You've even seen
him!"
8 Philip said, "Master, show us the
Father; then we'll be content."
9 "You've been with me all this me,
Philip, and you s ll don't understand? To
see me is to see the Father. So how can
you ask, 'Where is the Father?'
10 Don't you believe that I am in the
Father and the Father is in me? The
words that I speak to you aren't mere
words. I don't just make them up on myJOHN 14
105
own. The Father who resides in me cra s
each word into a divine act.
11 "Believe me: I am in my Father and
my Father is in me. If you can't believe
that, believe what you see--these works.
12 The person who trusts me will not
only do what I'm doing but even greater
things, because I, on my way to the
Father, am giving you the same work to
do that I've been doing. You can count
on it.
13 From now on, whatever you request
along the lines of who I am and what I
am doing, I'll do it. That's how the Father
will be seen for who he is in the Son. I
mean it.
14 Whatever you request in this way, I'll
do.
15 "If you love me, show it by doing
what I've told you.JOHN 14
106
16 I will talk to the Father, and he'll
provide you another Friend so that you
will always have someone with you.
17 This Friend is the Spirit of Truth. The
godless world can't take him in because
it doesn't have eyes to see him, doesn't
know what to look for. But you know
him already because he has been staying
with you, and will even be in you!
18 "I will not leave you orphaned. I'm
coming back.
19 In just a li le while the world will no
longer see me, but you're going to see
me because I am alive and you're about
to come alive.
20 At that moment you will know
absolutely that I'm in my Father, and
you're in me, and I'm in you.
21 "The person who knows my
commandments and keeps them, that's
who loves me. And the person who lovesJOHN 14
107
me will be loved by my Father, and I will
love him and make myself plain to him."
22 Judas (not Iscariot) said, "Master,
why is it that you are about to make
yourself plain to us but not to the
world?"
23 "Because a loveless world," said
Jesus, "is a sightless world. If anyone
loves me, he will carefully keep my word
and my Father will love him--we'll move
right into the neighborhood!
24 Not loving me means not keeping
my words. The message you are hearing
isn't mine. It's the message of the Father
who sent me.
25 "I'm telling you these things while
I'm s ll living with you.
26 The Friend, the Holy Spirit whom the
Father will send at my request, will make
everything plain to you. He will remind
you of all the things I have told you.JOHN 14
108
27 I'm leaving you well and whole.
That's my par ng gi to you. Peace. I
don't leave you the way you're used to
being le --feeling abandoned, bere . So
don't be upset. Don't be distraught.
28 "You've heard me tell you, 'I'm going
away, and I'm coming back.' If you loved
me, you would be glad that I'm on my
way to the Father because the Father is
the goal and purpose of my life.
29 "I've told you this ahead of me,
before it happens, so that when it does
happen, the conﬁrma on will deepen
your belief in me.
30 I'll not be talking with you much
more like this because the chief of this
godless world is about to a ack. But
don't worry--he has nothing on me, no
claim on me.
31 But so the world might know how
thoroughly I love the Father, I am
carrying out my Father's instruc onsJOHN 15
109
right down to the last detail. "Get up.
Let's go. It's me to leave here.
1 "I am the Real Vine and my
Father is the Farmer.
2 He cuts oﬀ every branch of me that
doesn't bear grapes. And every branch
that is grape-bearing he prunes back so
it will bear even more.
3 You are already pruned back by the
message I have spoken.
4 "Live in me. Make your home in me
just as I do in you. In the same way that
a branch can't bear grapes by itself but
only by being joined to the vine, you
can't bear fruit unless you are joined
with me.
5 "I am the Vine, you are the branches.
When you're joined with me and I with
you, the rela on in mate and organic,
the harvest is sure to be abundant.
Separated, you can't produce a thing.
15JOHN 15
110
6 Anyone who separates from me is
deadwood, gathered up and thrown on
the bonﬁre.
7 But if you make yourselves at home
with me and my words are at home in
you, you can be sure that whatever you
ask will be listened to and acted upon.
8 This is how my Father shows who he
is--when you produce grapes, when you
mature as my disciples.
9 "I've loved you the way my Father has
loved me. Make yourselves at home in
my love.
10 If you keep my commands, you'll
remain in mately at home in my love.
That's what I've done--kept my Father's
commands and made myself at home in
his love.
11 "I've told you these things for a
purpose: that my joy might be your joy,
and your joy wholly mature.JOHN 15
111
12 This is my command: Love one
another the way I loved you.
13 This is the very best way to love. Put
your life on the line for your friends.
14 You are my friends when you do the
things I command you.
15 I'm no longer calling you servants
because servants don't understand what
their master is thinking and planning.
No, I've named you friends because I've
let you in on everything I've heard from
the Father.
16 "You didn't choose me, remember; I
chose you, and put you in the world to
bear fruit, fruit that won't spoil. As fruit
bearers, whatever you ask the Father in
rela on to me, he gives you.
17 "But remember the root command:
Love one another.
18 "If you ﬁnd the godless world is
ha ng you, remember it got its start
ha ng me.JOHN 15
112
19 If you lived on the world's terms, the
world would love you as one of its own.
But since I picked you to live on God's
terms and no longer on the world's
terms, the world is going to hate you.
20 "When that happens, remember this:
Servants don't get be er treatment than
their masters. If they beat on me, they
will certainly beat on you. If they did
what I told them, they will do what you
tell them.
21 "They are going to do all these things
to you because of the way they treated
me, because they don't know the One
who sent me.
22 If I hadn't come and told them all this
in plain language, it wouldn't be so bad.
As it is, they have no excuse.
23 Hate me, hate my Father--it's all the
same.
24 If I hadn't done what I have done
among them, works no one has everJOHN 15 – 16
113
done, they wouldn't be to blame. But
they saw the God-signs and hated
anyway, both me and my Father.
25 Interes ng--they have veriﬁed the
truth of their own Scriptures where it
is wri en, 'They hated me for no good
reason.'
26 "When the Friend I plan to send you
from the Father comes--the Spirit of
Truth issuing from the Father--he will
conﬁrm everything about me.
27 You, too, from your side must give
your conﬁrming evidence, since you are
in this with me from the start.
1 "I've told you these things to
prepare you for rough mes
ahead.
2 They are going to throw you out of the
mee ng places. There will even come
a me when anyone who kills you will
think he's doing God a favor.
16JOHN 16
114
3 They will do these things because they
never really understood the Father.
4 I've told you these things so that
when the me comes and they start in
on you, you'll be well-warned and ready
for them. "I didn't tell you this earlier
because I was with you every day.
5 But now I am on my way to the One
who sent me. Not one of you has asked,
'Where are you going?'
6 Instead, the longer I've talked, the
sadder you've become.
7 So let me say it again, this truth: It's
be er for you that I leave. If I don't
leave, the Friend won't come. But if I go,
I'll send him to you.
8 "When he comes, he'll expose the
error of the godless world's view of sin,
righteousness, and judgment:
9 He'll show them that their refusal to
believe in me is their basic sin;JOHN 16
115
10 that righteousness comes from
above, where I am with the Father, out
of their sight and control;
11 that judgment takes place as the
ruler of this godless world is brought to
trial and convicted.
12 "I s ll have many things to tell you,
but you can't handle them now.
13 But when the Friend comes, the
Spirit of the Truth, he will take you by
the hand and guide you into all the truth
there is. He won't draw a en on to
himself, but will make sense out of what
is about to happen and, indeed, out of
all that I have done and said.
14 He will honor me; he will take from
me and deliver it to you.
15 Everything the Father has is also
mine. That is why I've said, 'He takes
from me and delivers to you.'JOHN 16
116
16 "In a day or so you're not going to
see me, but then in another day or so
you will see me."
17 That s rred up a hornet's nest of
ques ons among the disciples: "What's
he talking about: 'In a day or so you're
not going to see me, but then in another
day or so you will see me'? And, 'Because
I'm on my way to the Father'?
18 What is this 'day or so'? We don't
know what he's talking about."
19 Jesus knew they were dying to ask
him what he meant, so he said, "Are you
trying to ﬁgure out among yourselves
what I meant when I said, 'In a day or so
you're not going to see me, but then in
another day or so you will see me'?
20 Then ﬁx this ﬁrmly in your minds:
You're going to be in deep mourning
while the godless world throws a party.
You'll be sad, very sad, but your sadness
will develop into gladness.JOHN 16
117
21 "When a woman gives birth, she has
a hard me, there's no ge ng around it.
But when the baby is born, there is joy
in the birth. This new life in the world
wipes out memory of the pain.
22 The sadness you have right now is
similar to that pain, but the coming joy is
also similar. When I see you again, you'll
be full of joy, and it will be a joy no one
can rob from you.
23 You'll no longer be so full of
ques ons. "This is what I want you to do:
Ask the Father for whatever is in keeping
with the things I've revealed to you.
24 Ask in my name, according to my will,
and he'll most certainly give it to you.
Your joy will be a river overﬂowing its
banks!
25 "I've used ﬁgures of speech in telling
you these things. Soon I'll drop the
ﬁgures and tell you about the Father in
plain language.JOHN 16
118
26 Then you can make your requests
directly to him in rela on to this life I've
revealed to you. I won't con nue making
requests of the Father on your behalf.
27 I won't need to. Because you've gone
out on a limb, commi ed yourselves to
love and trust in me, believing I came
directly from the Father, the Father loves
you directly.
28 First, I le the Father and arrived in
the world; now I leave the world and
travel to the Father."
29 His disciples said, "Finally! You're
giving it to us straight, in plain talk--no
more ﬁgures of speech.
30 Now we know that you know
everything--it all comes together in
you. You won't have to put up with our
ques ons anymore. We're convinced
you came from God."
31 Jesus answered them, "Do you ﬁnally
believe?JOHN 16 – 17
119
32 In fact, you're about to make a
run for it--saving your own skins and
abandoning me. But I'm not abandoned.
The Father is with me.
33 I've told you all this so that trus ng
me, you will be unshakable and assured,
deeply at peace. In this godless world you
will con nue to experience diﬃcul es.
But take heart! I've conquered the
world."
1 Jesus said these things. Then,
raising his eyes in prayer, he
said: Father, it's me. Display the bright
splendor of your Son So the Son in turn
may show your bright splendor.
2 You put him in charge of everything
human So he might give real and eternal
life to all in his charge.
3 And this is the real and eternal life:
That they know you, The one and only
true God, And Jesus Christ, whom you
sent.
17JOHN 17
4 I gloriﬁed you on earth By comple
120
ng
down to the last detail What you
assigned me to do.
5 And now, Father, glorify me with your
very own splendor, The very splendor I
had in your presence Before there was a
world.
6 I spelled out your character in detail
To the men and women you gave me.
They were yours in the ﬁrst place; Then
you gave them to me, And they have
now done what you said.
7 They know now, beyond the shadow
of a doubt, That everything you gave me
is ﬁrsthand from you,
8 For the message you gave me, I
gave them; And they took it, and were
convinced That I came from you. They
believed that you sent me.
9 I pray for them. I'm not praying for the
God-rejec ng world But for those you
gave me, For they are yours by right.JOHN 17
121
10 Everything mine is yours, and yours
mine, And my life is on display in them.
11 For I'm no longer going to be visible
in the world; They'll con nue in the
world While I return to you. Holy Father,
guard them as they pursue this life That
you conferred as a gi through me, So
they can be one heart and mind
12 As we are one heart and mind. As
long as I was with them, I guarded them
In the pursuit of the life you gave through
me; I even posted a night watch. And
not one of them got away, Except for the
rebel bent on destruc on (the excep on
that proved the rule of Scripture).
13 Now I'm returning to you. I'm saying
these things in the world's hearing
So my people can experience My joy
completed in them.
14 I gave them your word; The godless
world hated them because of it, Because
they didn't join the world's ways,JOHN 17
122
15 Just as I didn't join the world's ways.
I'm not asking that you take them out of
the world But that you guard them from
the Evil One.
16 They are no more deﬁned by the
world Than I am deﬁned by the world.
17 Make them holy--consecrated--with
the truth; Your word is consecra ng
truth.
18 In the same way that you gave me
a mission in the world, I give them a
mission in the world.
19 I'm consecra ng myself for their
sakes So they'll be truth-consecrated in
their mission.
20 I'm praying not only for them But also
for those who will believe in me Because
of them and their witness about me.
21 The goal is for all of them to become
one heart and mind--Just as you, Father,
are in me and I in you, So they might be
one heart and mind with us. Then theJOHN 17
123
world might believe that you, in fact,
sent me.
22 The same glory you gave me, I
gave them, So they'll be as uniﬁed and
together as we are--
23 I in them and you in me. Then they'll
be mature in this oneness, And give the
godless world evidence That you've sent
me and loved them In the same way
you've loved me.
24 Father, I want those you gave me To
be with me, right where I am, So they
can see my glory, the splendor you gave
me, Having loved me Long before there
ever was a world.
25 Righteous Father, the world has
never known you, But I have known you,
and these disciples know That you sent
me on this mission.
26 I have made your very being known
to them--Who you are and what you
do--And con nue to make it known, SoJOHN 18
124
that your love for me Might be in them
Exactly as I am in them.
1 Jesus, having prayed this prayer,
le with his disciples and crossed
over the brook Kidron at a place where
there was a garden. He and his disciples
entered it.
2 Judas, his betrayer, knew the place
because Jesus and his disciples went
there o en.
3 So Judas led the way to the garden,
and the Roman soldiers and police
sent by the high priests and Pharisees
followed. They arrived there with
lanterns and torches and swords.
4 Jesus, knowing by now everything
that was coming down on him, went
out and met them. He said, "Who are
you a er?" They answered, "Jesus the
Nazarene."
18JOHN 18
125
5 He said, "That's me." The soldiers
recoiled, totally taken aback. Judas, his
betrayer, stood out like a sore thumb.
7 Jesus asked again, "Who are you
a er?" They answered, "Jesus the
Nazarene."
8 "I told you," said Jesus, "that's me.
I'm the one. So if it's me you're a er, let
these others go."
9 (This validated the words in his prayer,
"I didn't lose one of those you gave.")
10 Just then Simon Peter, who was
carrying a sword, pulled it from its
sheath and struck the Chief Priest's
servant, cu ng oﬀ his right ear. Malchus
was the servant's name.
11 Jesus ordered Peter, "Put back your
sword. Do you think for a minute I'm not
going to drink this cup the Father gave
me?"JOHN 18
126
12 Then the Roman soldiers under their
commander, joined by the Jewish police,
seized Jesus and ed him up.
13 They took him ﬁrst to Annas,
father-in-law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas was
the Chief Priest that year.
14 It was Caiaphas who had advised the
Jews that it was to their advantage that
one man die for the people.
15 Simon Peter and another disciple
followed Jesus. That other disciple was
known to the Chief Priest, and so he
went in with Jesus to the Chief Priest's
courtyard.
16 Peter had to stay outside. Then the
other disciple went out, spoke to the
doorkeeper, and got Peter in.
17 The young woman who was the
doorkeeper said to Peter, "Aren't you
one of this man's disciples?" He said,
"No, I'm not."JOHN 18
127
18 The servants and police had made
a ﬁre because of the cold and were
huddled there warming themselves.
Peter stood with them, trying to get
warm.
19 Annas interrogated Jesus regarding
his disciples and his teaching.
20 Jesus answered, "I've spoken openly
in public. I've taught regularly in mee ng
places and the Temple, where the Jews
all come together. Everything has been
out in the open. I've said nothing in
secret.
21 So why are you trea ng me like a
conspirator? Ques on those who have
been listening to me. They know well
what I have said. My teachings have all
been aboveboard."
22 When he said this, one of the
policemen standing there slapped Jesus
across the face, saying, "How dare you
speak to the Chief Priest like that!"JOHN 18
128
23 Jesus replied, "If I've said something
wrong, prove it. But if I've spoken the
plain truth, why this slapping around?"
24 Then Annas sent him, s ll ed up, to
the Chief Priest Caiaphas.
25 Meanwhile, Simon Peter was back
at the ﬁre, s ll trying to get warm. The
others there said to him, "Aren't you one
of his disciples?" He denied it, "Not me."
26 One of the Chief Priest's servants,
a rela ve of the man whose ear Peter
had cut oﬀ, said, "Didn't I see you in the
garden with him?"
27 Again, Peter denied it. Just then a
rooster crowed.
28 They led Jesus then from Caiaphas
to the Roman governor's palace. It was
early morning. They themselves didn't
enter the palace because they didn't
want to be disqualiﬁed from ea ng the
Passover.JOHN 18
129
29 So Pilate came out to them and
spoke. "What charge do you bring
against this man?"
30 They said, "If he hadn't been doing
something evil, do you think we'd be
here bothering you?"
31 Pilate said, "You take him. Judge him
by your law." The Jews said, "We're not
allowed to kill anyone."
32 (This would conﬁrm Jesus' word
indica ng the way he would die.)
33 Pilate went back into the palace and
called for Jesus. He said, "Are you the
'King of the Jews'?"
34 Jesus answered, "Are you saying this
on your own, or did others tell you this
about me?"
35 Pilate said, "Do I look like a Jew? Your
people and your high priests turned you
over to me. What did you do?"
36 "My kingdom," said Jesus, "doesn't
consist of what you see around you. IfJOHN 18 – 19
130
it did, my followers would ﬁght so that
I wouldn't be handed over to the Jews.
But I'm not that kind of king, not the
world's kind of king."
37 Then Pilate said, "So, are you a
king or not?" Jesus answered, "You tell
me. Because I am King, I was born and
entered the world so that I could witness
to the truth. Everyone who cares for
truth, who has any feeling for the truth,
recognizes my voice."
38 Pilate said, "What is truth?" Then
he went back out to the Jews and told
them, "I ﬁnd nothing wrong in this man.
39 It's your custom that I pardon one
prisoner at Passover. Do you want me to
pardon the 'King of the Jews'?"
40 They shouted back, "Not this one,
but Barabbas!" Barabbas was a Jewish
freedom ﬁghter.
1 So Pilate took Jesus and had him
whipped.
19JOHN 19
131
2 The soldiers, having braided a crown
from thorns, set it on his head, threw a
purple robe over him,
3 and approached him with, "Hail, King
of the Jews!" Then they greeted him
with slaps in the face.
4 Pilate went back out again and said to
them, "I present him to you, but I want
you to know that I do not ﬁnd him guilty
of any crime."
5 Just then Jesus came out wearing the
thorn crown and purple robe. Pilate
announced, "Here he is: the Man."
6 When the high priests and police saw
him, they shouted in a frenzy, "Crucify!
Crucify!" Pilate told them, "You take him.
You crucify him. I ﬁnd nothing wrong
with him."
7 The Jews answered, "We have a law,
and by that law he must die because he
claimed to be the Son of God."JOHN 19
132
8 When Pilate heard this, he became
even more scared.
9 He went back into the palace and said
to Jesus, "Where did you come from?"
Jesus gave no answer.
10 Pilate said, "You won't talk? Don't
you know that I have the authority to
pardon you, and the authority to--crucify
you?"
11 Jesus said, "You haven't a shred
of authority over me except what has
been given you from heaven. That's why
the one who betrayed me to you has
commi ed a far greater fault."
12 At this, Pilate tried his best to pardon
him, but the Jews shouted him down: "If
you pardon this man, you're no friend of
Caesar's. Anyone se ng himself up as
'king' deﬁes Caesar."
13 When Pilate heard those words, he
led Jesus outside. He sat down at theJOHN 19
133
judgment seat in the area designated
Stone Court (in Hebrew, [Gabbatha]).
14 It was the prepara on day for
Passover. The hour was noon. Pilate said
to the Jews, "Here is your king."
15 They shouted back, "Kill him! Kill him!
Crucify him!" Pilate said, "I am to crucify
your king?" The high priests answered,
"We have no king except Caesar."
16 Pilate caved in to their demand. He
turned him over to be cruciﬁed. They
took Jesus away.
17 Carrying his cross, Jesus went out to
the place called Skull Hill (the name in
Hebrew is Golgotha),
18 where they cruciﬁed him, and with
him two others, one on each side, Jesus
in the middle.
19 Pilate wrote a sign and had it
placed on the cross. It read: JESUS THE
NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWSJOHN 19
134
20 Many of the Jews read the sign
because the place where Jesus was
cruciﬁed was right next to the city. It was
wri en in Hebrew, La n, and Greek.
21 The Jewish high priests objected.
"Don't write," they said to Pilate, "'The
King of the Jews.' Make it, 'This man
said, "I am the King of the Jews."'"
22 Pilate said, "What I've wri en, I've
wri en."
23 When they cruciﬁed him, the Roman
soldiers took his clothes and divided
them up four ways, to each soldier a
fourth. But his robe was seamless, a
single piece of weaving,
24 so they said to each other, "Let's
not tear it up. Let's throw dice to
see who gets it." This conﬁrmed the
Scripture that said, "They divided up
my clothes among them and threw dice
for my coat." (The soldiers validatedJOHN 19
135
the Scriptures!) While the soldiers were
looking a er themselves,
25 Jesus' mother, his aunt, Mary the
wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene
stood at the foot of the cross.
26 Jesus saw his mother and the disciple
he loved standing near her. He said to
his mother, "Woman, here is your son."
27 Then to the disciple, "Here is your
mother." From that moment the disciple
accepted her as his own mother.
28 Jesus, seeing that everything had
been completed so that the Scripture
record might also be complete, then
said, "I'm thirsty."
29 A jug of sour wine was standing by.
Someone put a sponge soaked with
the wine on a javelin and li ed it to his
mouth.
30 A er he took the wine, Jesus said,
"It's done...complete." Bowing his head,
he oﬀered up his spirit.JOHN 19
136
31 Then the Jews, since it was the day of
Sabbath prepara on, and so the bodies
wouldn't stay on the crosses over the
Sabbath (it was a high holy day that
year), pe oned Pilate that their legs be
broken to speed death, and the bodies
taken down.
32 So the soldiers came and broke the
legs of the ﬁrst man cruciﬁed with Jesus,
and then the other.
33 When they got to Jesus, they saw
that he was already dead, so they didn't
break his legs.
34 One of the soldiers stabbed him in
the side with his spear. Blood and water
gushed out.
35 The eyewitness to these things has
presented an accurate report. He saw it
himself and is telling the truth so that
you, also, will believe.JOHN 19
137
36 These things that happened
conﬁrmed the Scripture, "Not a bone in
his body was broken,"
37 and the other Scripture that reads,
"They will stare at the one they pierced."
38 A er all this, Joseph of Arimathea
(he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly,
because he was in midated by the Jews)
pe oned Pilate to take the body of
Jesus. Pilate gave permission. So Joseph
came and took the body.
39 Nicodemus, who had ﬁrst come
to Jesus at night, came now in broad
daylight carrying a mixture of myrrh and
aloes, about seventy-ﬁve pounds.
40 They took Jesus' body and, following
the Jewish burial custom, wrapped it in
linen with the spices.
41 There was a garden near the place
he was cruciﬁed, and in the garden a
new tomb in which no one had yet been
placed.JOHN 19 – 20
138
42 So, because it was Sabbath
prepara on for the Jews and the tomb
was convenient, they placed Jesus in it.
1 Early in the morning on the ﬁrst
day of the week, while it was
s ll dark, Mary Magdalene came to the
tomb and saw that the stone was moved
away from the entrance.
2 She ran at once to Simon Peter and
the other disciple, the one Jesus loved,
breathlessly pan ng, "They took the
Master from the tomb. We don't know
where they've put him."
3 Peter and the other disciple le
immediately for the tomb.
4 They ran, neck and neck. The other
disciple got to the tomb ﬁrst, outrunning
Peter.
5 Stooping to look in, he saw the pieces
of linen cloth lying there, but he didn't
go in.
20JOHN 20
6 Simon Peter arrived a
139
er him, entered
the tomb, observed the linen cloths lying
there,
7 and the kerchief used to cover his
head not lying with the linen cloths but
separate, neatly folded by itself.
8 Then the other disciple, the one who
had go en there ﬁrst, went into the
tomb, took one look at the evidence,
and believed.
9 No one yet knew from the Scripture
that he had to rise from the dead.
10 The disciples then went back home.
11 But Mary stood outside the tomb
weeping. As she wept, she knelt to look
into the tomb
12 and saw two angels si ng there,
dressed in white, one at the head, the
other at the foot of where Jesus' body
had been laid.
13 They said to her, "Woman, why do
you weep?" "They took my Master," sheJOHN 20
140
said, "and I don't know where they put
him."
14 A er she said this, she turned away
and saw Jesus standing there. But she
didn't recognize him.
15 Jesus spoke to her, "Woman, why do
you weep? Who are you looking for?"
She, thinking that he was the gardener,
said, "Mister, if you took him, tell me
where you put him so I can care for him."
16 Jesus said, "Mary." Turning to face
him, she said in Hebrew, "Rabboni!"
meaning "Teacher!"
17 Jesus said, "Don't cling to me, for I
have not yet ascended to the Father. Go
to my brothers and tell them, 'I ascend
to my Father and your Father, my God
and your God.'"
18 Mary Magdalene went, telling
the news to the disciples: "I saw the
Master!" And she told them everything
he said to her.JOHN 20
141
19 Later on that day, the disciples had
gathered together, but, fearful of the
Jews, had locked all the doors in the
house. Jesus entered, stood among
them, and said, "Peace to you."
20 Then he showed them his hands and
side. The disciples, seeing the Master
with their own eyes, were exuberant.
21 Jesus repeated his gree ng: "Peace
to you. Just as the Father sent me, I send
you."
22 Then he took a deep breath and
breathed into them. "Receive the Holy
Spirit," he said.
23 "If you forgive someone's sins,
they're gone for good. If you don't
forgive sins, what are you going to do
with them?"
24 But Thomas, some mes called the
Twin, one of the Twelve, was not with
them when Jesus came.JOHN 20
142
25 The other disciples told him, "We saw
the Master." But he said, "Unless I see
the nail holes in his hands, put my ﬁnger
in the nail holes, and s ck my hand in his
side, I won't believe it."
26 Eight days later, his disciples were
again in the room. This me Thomas
was with them. Jesus came through the
locked doors, stood among them, and
said, "Peace to you."
27 Then he focused his a en on on
Thomas. "Take your ﬁnger and examine
my hands. Take your hand and s ck it in
my side. Don't be unbelieving. Believe."
28 Thomas said, "My Master! My God!"
29 Jesus said, "So, you believe because
you've seen with your own eyes. Even
be er blessings are in store for those
who believe without seeing."
30 Jesus provided far more God-
revealing signs than are wri en down in
this book.JOHN 20 – 21
31 These are wri
143
en down so you will
believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the
Son of God, and in the act of believing,
have real and eternal life in the way he
personally revealed it.
1 A er this, Jesus appeared again
to the disciples, this me at the
Tiberias Sea (the Sea of Galilee). This is
how he did it:
2 Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed
"Twin"), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,
the brothers Zebedee, and two other
disciples were together.
3 Simon Peter announced, "I'm going
ﬁshing." The rest of them replied, "We're
going with you." They went out and got
in the boat. They caught nothing that
night.
4 When the sun came up, Jesus was
standing on the beach, but they didn't
recognize him.
21JOHN 21
144
5 Jesus spoke to them: "Good morning!
Did you catch anything for breakfast?"
They answered, "No."
6 He said, "Throw the net oﬀ the right
side of the boat and see what happens."
They did what he said. All of a sudden
there were so many ﬁsh in it, they
weren't strong enough to pull it in.
7 Then the disciple Jesus loved said to
Peter, "It's the Master!" When Simon
Peter realized that it was the Master,
he threw on some clothes, for he was
stripped for work, and dove into the sea.
8 The other disciples came in by boat
for they weren't far from land, a hundred
yards or so, pulling along the net full of
ﬁsh.
9 When they got out of the boat, they
saw a ﬁre laid, with ﬁsh and bread
cooking on it.
10 Jesus said, "Bring some of the ﬁsh
you've just caught."JOHN 21
145
11 Simon Peter joined them and pulled
the net to shore--153 big ﬁsh! And even
with all those ﬁsh, the net didn't rip.
12 Jesus said, "Breakfast is ready." Not
one of the disciples dared ask, "Who are
you?" They knew it was the Master.
13 Jesus then took the bread and gave it
to them. He did the same with the ﬁsh.
14 This was now the third me Jesus
had shown himself alive to the disciples
since being raised from the dead.
15 A er breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love
me more than these?" "Yes, Master, you
know I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my
lambs."
16 He then asked a second me, "Simon,
son of John, do you love me?" "Yes,
Master, you know I love you." Jesus said,
"Shepherd my sheep."
17 Then he said it a third me: "Simon,
son of John, do you love me?" Peter wasJOHN 21
146
upset that he asked for the third me,
"Do you love me?" so he answered,
"Master, you know everything there is
to know. You've got to know that I love
you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.
18 I'm telling you the very truth now:
When you were young you dressed
yourself and went wherever you wished,
but when you get old you'll have to
stretch out your hands while someone
else dresses you and takes you where
you don't want to go."
19 He said this to hint at the kind of
death by which Peter would glorify God.
And then he commanded, "Follow me."
20 Turning his head, Peter no ced
the disciple Jesus loved following right
behind.
21 When Peter no ced him, he asked
Jesus, "Master, what's going to happen
to him?"JOHN 21
147
22 Jesus said, "If I want him to live
un l I come again, what's that to you?
You--follow me."
23 That is how the rumor got out among
the brothers that this disciple wouldn't
die. But that is not what Jesus said. He
simply said, "If I want him to live un l I
come again, what's that to you?"
24 This is the same disciple who was
eyewitness to all these things and wrote
them down. And we all know that
his eyewitness account is reliable and
accurate.
25 There are so many other things Jesus
did. If they were all wri en down, each
of them, one by one, I can't imagine a
world big enough to hold such a library
of books.Acts of the Apostles
1
1 Dear Theophilus, in the ﬁrst volume
of this book I wrote on everything
that Jesus began to do and teach
2 un l the day he said good-bye to
the apostles, the ones he had chosen
through the Holy Spirit, and was taken
up to heaven.
3 A er his death, he presented himself
alive to them in many diﬀerent se ngs
over a period of forty days. In face-to-
face mee ngs, he talked to them about
things concerning the kingdom of God.
4 As they met and ate meals together,
he told them that they were on no
account to leave Jerusalem but "must
wait for what the Father promised: the
promise you heard from me.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
5 John bap
2
zed in water; you will be
bap zed in the Holy Spirit. And soon."
6 When they were together for the last
me they asked, "Master, are you going
to restore the kingdom to Israel now? Is
this the me?"
7 He told them, "You don't get to know
the me. Timing is the Father's business.
8 What you'll get is the Holy Spirit. And
when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
you will be able to be my witnesses in
Jerusalem, all over Judea and Samaria,
even to the ends of the world."
9 These were his last words. As
they watched, he was taken up and
disappeared in a cloud.
10 They stood there, staring into
the empty sky. Suddenly two men
appeared--in white robes!
11 They said, "You Galileans!--why do
you just stand here looking up at an
empty sky? This very Jesus who wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1
3
taken up from among you to heaven will
come as certainly--and mysteriously--as
he le ."
12 So they le the mountain called
Olives and returned to Jerusalem. It was
a li le over half a mile.
13 They went to the upper room they
had been using as a mee ng place: Peter,
John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas,
Bartholomew, Ma hew, James, son of
Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas, son
of James.
14 They agreed they were in this for
good, completely together in prayer, the
women included. Also Jesus' mother,
Mary, and his brothers.
15 During this me, Peter stood up in
the company--there were about one
hundred twenty of them in the room at
the me--
16 and said, "Friends, long ago the Holy
Spirit spoke through David regardingACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1

Judas, who became the guide to those
who arrested Jesus. That Scripture had
to be fulﬁlled, and now has been.
17 Judas was one of us and had his
assigned place in this ministry.
18 "As you know, he took the evil bribe
money and bought a small farm. There
he came to a bad end, rupturing his belly
and spilling his guts.
19 Everybody in Jerusalem knows this
by now; they call the place Murder
Meadow.
20 It's exactly what we ﬁnd wri en
in the Psalms: Let his farm become
haunted So no one can ever live there.
"And also what was wri en later: Let
someone else take over his post.
21 "Judas must now be replaced. The
replacement must come from the
company of men who stayed together
with usACTS OF THE APOSTLES 1 – 2
22 from the
5
me Jesus was bap zed
by John up to the day of his ascension,
designated along with us as a witness to
his resurrec on."
23 They nominated two: Joseph
Barsabbas, nicknamed Justus, and
Ma hias.
24 Then they prayed, "You, O God,
know every one of us inside and out.
Make plain which of these two men you
choose
25 to take the place in this ministry and
leadership that Judas threw away in
order to go his own way."
26 They then drew straws. Ma hias
won and was counted in with the eleven
apostles.
1 When the Feast of Pentecost came,
they were all together in one place.
2 Without warning there was a sound
like a strong wind, gale force--no one
2ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
6
could tell where it came from. It ﬁlled
the whole building.
3 Then, like a wildﬁre, the Holy Spirit
spread through their ranks,
4 and they started speaking in a number
of diﬀerent languages as the Spirit
prompted them.
5 There were many Jews staying in
Jerusalem just then, devout pilgrims
from all over the world.
6 When they heard the sound, they
came on the run. Then when they
heard, one a er another, their own
mother tongues being spoken, they
were thunderstruck.
7 They couldn't for the life of them
ﬁgure out what was going on, and kept
saying, "Aren't these all Galileans?
8 How come we're hearing them talk in
our various mother tongues?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
9 Parthians, Medes, and Elamites;
Visitors from Mesopotamia, Judea, and
Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

Immigrants from Rome,
11 both Jews and proselytes; Even
Cretans and Arabs! "They're speaking
our languages, describing God's mighty
works!"
12 Their heads were spinning; they
couldn't make head or tail of any of it.
They talked back and forth, confused:
"What's going on here?"
13 Others joked, "They're drunk on
cheap wine."
14 That's when Peter stood up and,
backed by the other eleven, spoke out
with bold urgency: "Fellow Jews, all of
you who are visi ng Jerusalem, listen
carefully and get this story straight.
7ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
8
15 These people aren't drunk as some
of you suspect. They haven't had me
to get drunk--it's only nine o'clock in the
morning.
16 This is what the prophet Joel
announced would happen:
17 "In the Last Days," God says, "I will
pour out my Spirit on every kind of
people: Your sons will prophesy, also
your daughters; Your young men will see
visions, your old men dream dreams.
18 When the me comes, I'll pour out
my Spirit On those who serve me, men
and women both, and they'll prophesy.
19 I'll set wonders in the sky above and
signs on the earth below, Blood and ﬁre
and billowing smoke,

moon blood-red, Before the Day of the
Lord arrives, the Day tremendous and
marvelous;ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
9
21 And whoever calls out for help to me,
God, will be saved."
22 "Fellow Israelites, listen carefully
to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a
man thoroughly accredited by God to
you--the miracles and wonders and signs
that God did through him are common
knowledge--
23 this Jesus, following the deliberate
and well-thought-out plan of God, was
betrayed by men who took the law into
their own hands, and was handed over
to you. And you pinned him to a cross
and killed him.
24 But God un ed the death ropes and
raised him up. Death was no match for
him.
25 David said it all: I saw God before me
for all me. Nothing can shake me; he's
right by my side.
26 I'm glad from the inside out, ecsta c;
I've pitched my tent in the land of hope.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
10
27 I know you'll never dump me in
Hades; I'll never even smell the stench of
death.
28 You've got my feet on the life-path,
with your face shining sun-joy all around.
29 "Dear friends, let me be completely
frank with you. Our ancestor David is
dead and buried--his tomb is in plain
sight today.
30 But being also a prophet and
knowing that God had solemnly sworn
that a descendant of his would rule his
kingdom,
31 seeing far ahead, he talked of the
resurrec on of the Messiah--'no trip to
Hades, no stench of death.'
32 This Jesus, God raised up. And every
one of us here is a witness to it.
33 Then, raised to the heights at the
right hand of God and receiving the
promise of the Holy Spirit from the
Father, he poured out the Spirit he hadACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
11
just received. That is what you see and
hear.
34 For David himself did not ascend to
heaven, but he did say, God said to my
Master, "Sit at my right hand
35 Un l I make your enemies a stool for
res ng your feet."
36 "All Israel, then, know this: There's
no longer room for doubt--God made
him Master and Messiah, this Jesus
whom you killed on a cross."
37 Cut to the quick, those who were
there listening asked Peter and the other
apostles, "Brothers! Brothers! So now
what do we do?"
38 Peter said, "Change your life. Turn
to God and be bap zed, each of you, in
the name of Jesus Christ, so your sins
are forgiven. Receive the gi of the Holy
Spirit.
39 The promise is targeted to you and
your children, but also to all who areACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2
12
far away--whomever, in fact, our Master
God invites."
40 He went on in this vein for a long
me, urging them over and over, "Get
out while you can; get out of this sick
and stupid culture!"
41 That day about three thousand took
him at his word, were bap zed and were
signed up.
42 They commi ed themselves to
the teaching of the apostles, the life
together, the common meal, and the
prayers.
43 Everyone around was in awe--all
those wonders and signs done through
the apostles!
44 And all the believers lived in a
wonderful harmony, holding everything
in common.
45 They sold whatever they owned and
pooled their resources so that each
person's need was met.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 2 – 3
13
46 They followed a daily discipline of
worship in the Temple followed by meals
at home, every meal a celebra on,
exuberant and joyful,
47 as they praised God. People in
general liked what they saw. Every day
their number grew as God added those
who were saved.
1 One day at three o'clock in the
a ernoon, Peter and John were on
their way into the Temple for prayer
mee ng.
2 At the same me there was a man
crippled from birth being carried up.
Every day he was set down at the Temple
gate, the one named Beau ful, to beg
from those going into the Temple.
3 When he saw Peter and John about
to enter the Temple, he asked for a
handout.
3ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
14
4 Peter, with John at his side, looked
him straight in the eye and said, "Look
here."
5 He looked up, expec ng to get
something from them.
6 Peter said, "I don't have a nickel to my
name, but what I do have, I give you: In
the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
walk!"
7 He grabbed him by the right hand and
pulled him up. In an instant his feet and
ankles became ﬁrm.
8 He jumped to his feet and walked. The
man went into the Temple with them,
walking back and forth, dancing and
praising God.
9 Everybody there saw him walking
around and praising God.
10 They recognized him as the one
who sat begging at the Temple's
Gate Beau ful and rubbed their eyes,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 3
15
astonished, scarcely believing what they
were seeing.
11 The man threw his arms around
Peter and John, ecsta c. All the people
ran up to where they were at Solomon's
Porch to see it for themselves.
12 When Peter saw he had a
congrega on, he addressed the
people: "Oh, Israelites, why does this
take you by such complete surprise, and
why stare at us as if our power or piety
made him walk?
13 The God of Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has
gloriﬁed his Son Jesus. The very One that
Pilate called innocent, you repudiated.

place.

no idea what you were doing when
you killed Jesus, and neither did your
leaders.
18 But God, who through the preaching
of all the prophets had said all along
that his Messiah would be killed, knew
exactly what you were doing and used it
to fulﬁll his plans.

is restored to order again just the way
God, through the preaching of his holy
prophets of old, said it would be.
22 Moses, for instance, said, 'Your God
will raise up for you a prophet just like
me from your family. Listen to every
word he speaks to you.
23 Every last living soul who refuses to
listen to that prophet will be wiped out
from the people.'
24 "All the prophets from Samuel on
down said the same thing, said most
empha cally that these days would
come.
25 These prophets, along with the
covenant God made with your ancestors,
are your family tree. God's covenant-
word to Abraham provides the text: 'By
your oﬀspring all the families of the
earth will be blessed.'
26 But you are ﬁrst in line: God, having
raised up his Son, sent him to bless youACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
18
as you turn, one by one, from your evil
ways."
1 While Peter and John were
addressing the people, the priests,
the chief of the Temple police, and some
Sadducees came up,
2 indignant that these upstart apostles
were instruc ng the people and
proclaiming that the resurrec on from
the dead had taken place in Jesus.
3 They arrested them and threw them
in jail un l morning, for by now it was
late in the evening.
4 But many of those who listened had
already believed the Message--in round
numbers about ﬁve thousand!
5 The next day a mee ng was called in
Jerusalem. The rulers, religious leaders,
religion scholars,
6 Annas the Chief Priest, Caiaphas,
John, Alexander--everybody who was
anybody was there.
4ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
19
7 They stood Peter and John in the
middle of the room and grilled them:
"Who put you in charge here? What
business do you have doing this?"
8 With that, Peter, full of the Holy Spirit,
let loose: "Rulers and leaders of the
people,
9 if we have been brought to trial
today for helping a sick man, put under
inves ga on regarding this healing,
10 I'll be completely frank with you--we
have nothing to hide. By the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the One you
killed on a cross, the One God raised
from the dead, by means of his name
this man stands before you healthy and
whole.
11 Jesus is 'the stone you masons threw
out, which is now the cornerstone.'
12 Salva on comes no other way; no
other name has been or will be given toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
20
us by which we can be saved, only this
one."
13 They couldn't take their eyes oﬀ
them--Peter and John standing there
so conﬁdent, so sure of themselves!
Their fascina on deepened when they
realized these two were laymen with no
training in Scripture or formal educa on.
They recognized them as companions of
Jesus,
14 but with the man right before them,
seeing him standing there so upright--so
healed!--what could they say against
that?
15 They sent them out of the room so
they could work out a plan. They talked
it over:
16 "What can we do with these men?
By now it's known all over town that a
miracle has occurred, and that they are
behind it. There is no way we can refute
that.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
21
17 But so that it doesn't go any further,
let's silence them with threats so they
won't dare to use Jesus' name ever again
with anyone."
18 They called them back and warned
them that they were on no account ever
again to speak or teach in the name of
Jesus.
19 But Peter and John spoke right back,
"Whether it's right in God's eyes to listen
to you rather than to God, you decide.
20 As for us, there's no ques on--we
can't keep quiet about what we've seen
and heard."
21 The religious leaders renewed their
threats, but then released them. They
couldn't come up with a charge that
would s ck, that would keep them in
jail. The people wouldn't have stood for
it--they were all praising God over what
had happened.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
22
22 The man who had been miraculously
healed was over forty years old.
23 As soon as Peter and John were let
go, they went to their friends and told
them what the high priests and religious
leaders had said.
24 Hearing the report, they li ed their
voices in a wonderful harmony in prayer:
"Strong God, you made heaven and
earth and sea and everything in them.
25 By the Holy Spirit you spoke through
the mouth of your servant and our
father, David: Why the big noise,
na ons? Why the mean plots, peoples?
26 Earth's leaders push for posi on,
Potentates meet for summit talks, The
God-deniers, the Messiah-deﬁers!
27 "For in fact they did meet--Herod and
Pon us Pilate with na ons and peoples,
even Israel itself!--met in this very city to
plot against your holy Son Jesus, the One
you made Messiah,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4
23
28 to carry out the plans you long ago
set in mo on.
29 "And now they're at it again!
Take care of their threats and give
your servants fearless conﬁdence in
preaching your Message,
30 as you stretch out your hand to us in
healings and miracles and wonders done
in the name of your holy servant Jesus."
31 While they were praying, the place
where they were mee ng trembled and
shook. They were all ﬁlled with the Holy
Spirit and con nued to speak God's
Word with fearless conﬁdence.
32 The whole congrega on of believers
was united as one--one heart, one mind!
They didn't even claim ownership of
their own possessions. No one said,
"That's mine; you can't have it." They
shared everything.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 4 – 5
24
33 The apostles gave powerful witness
to the resurrec on of the Master Jesus,
and grace was on all of them.
34 And so it turned out that not a
person among them was needy. Those
who owned ﬁelds or houses sold them
and brought the price of the sale
35 to the apostles and made an oﬀering
of it. The apostles then distributed it
according to each person's need.
36 Joseph, called by the apostles
"Barnabas" (which means "Son of
Comfort"), a Levite born in Cyprus,
37 sold a ﬁeld that he owned, brought
the money, and made an oﬀering of it to
the apostles.
1 But a man named Ananias--his
wife, Sapphira, conniving in this with
him--sold a piece of land,
2 secretly kept part of the price for
himself, and then brought the rest to the
apostles and made an oﬀering of it.
5ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
25
3 Peter said, "Ananias, how did Satan
get you to lie to the Holy Spirit and
secretly keep back part of the price of
the ﬁeld?
4 Before you sold it, it was all yours, and
a er you sold it, the money was yours to
do with as you wished. So what got into
you to pull a trick like this? You didn't lie
to men but to God."
5 Ananias, when he heard those words,
fell down dead. That put the fear of God
into everyone who heard of it.
6 The younger men went right to work
and wrapped him up, then carried him
out and buried him.
7 Not more than three hours later,
his wife, knowing nothing of what had
happened, came in.
8 Peter said, "Tell me, were you given
this price for your ﬁeld?" "Yes," she said,
"that price."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
26
9 Peter responded, "What's going on
here that you connived to conspire
against the Spirit of the Master? The
men who buried your husband are at
the door, and you're next."
10 No sooner were the words out of his
mouth than she also fell down, dead.
When the young men returned they
found her body. They carried her out
and buried her beside her husband.
11 By this me the whole church and, in
fact, everyone who heard of these things
had a healthy respect for God. They
knew God was not to be triﬂed with.
12 Through the work of the apostles,
many God-signs were set up among the
people, many wonderful things done.
They all met regularly and in remarkable
harmony on the Temple porch named
a er Solomon.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
27
13 But even though people admired
them a lot, outsiders were wary about
joining them.
14 On the other hand, those who put
their trust in the Master were added
right and le , men and women both.
15 They even carried the sick out into
the streets and laid them on stretchers
and bedrolls, hoping they would be
touched by Peter's shadow when he
walked by.
16 They came from the villages
surrounding Jerusalem, throngs of them,
bringing the sick and bedeviled. And
they all were healed.
17 Provoked migh ly by all this, the
Chief Priest and those on his side, mainly
the sect of Sadducees, went into ac on,
18 arrested the apostles, and put them
in the town jail.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
28
19 But during the night an angel of God
opened the jailhouse door and led them
out.
20 He said, "Go to the Temple and take
your stand. Tell the people everything
there is to say about this Life."
21 Promptly obedient, they entered the
Temple at daybreak and went on with
their teaching. Meanwhile, the Chief
Priest and his cronies convened the High
Council, Israel's senate, and sent to the
jail to have the prisoners brought in.
22 When the police got there, they
couldn't ﬁnd them anywhere in the jail.
They went back and reported,
23 "We found the jail locked ght as
a drum and the guards posted at the
doors, but when we went inside we
didn't ﬁnd a soul."
24 The chief of the Temple police and
the high priests were puzzled. "What's
going on here anyway?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
29
25 Just then someone showed up
and said, "Did you know that the men
you put in jail are back in the Temple
teaching the people?"
26 The chief and his police went and
got them, but they handled them gently,
fearful that the people would riot and
turn on them.
27 Bringing them back, they stood them
before the High Council. The Chief Priest
said,
28 "Didn't we give you strict orders not
to teach in Jesus' name? And here you
have ﬁlled Jerusalem with your teaching
and are trying your best to blame us for
the death of this man."
29 Peter and the apostles answered,
"It's necessary to obey God rather than
men.
30 The God of our ancestors raised up
Jesus, the One you killed by hanging him
on a cross.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
30
31 God set him on high at his side,
Prince and Savior, to give Israel the gi
of a changed life and sins forgiven.
32 And we are witnesses to these things.
The Holy Spirit, whom God gives to
those who obey him, corroborates every
detail."
33 When they heard that, they were
furious and wanted to kill them on the
spot.
34 But one of the council members
stood up, a Pharisee by the name of
Gamaliel, a teacher of God's Law who
was honored by everyone. He ordered
the men taken out of the room for a
short me,
35 then said, "Fellow Israelites, be
careful what you do to these men.
36 Not long ago Theudas made
something of a splash, claiming to be
somebody, and got about four hundred
men to join him. He was killed, hisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5
31
followers dispersed, and nothing came
of it.
37 A li le later, at the me of the
census, Judas the Galilean appeared
and acquired a following. He also ﬁzzled
out and the people following him were
sca ered to the four winds.
38 "So I am telling you: Hands oﬀ these
men! Let them alone. If this program
or this work is merely human, it will fall
apart,
39 but if it is of God, there is nothing
you can do about it--and you be er not
be found ﬁgh ng against God!"
40 That convinced them. They called
the apostles back in. A er giving them a
thorough whipping, they warned them
not to speak in Jesus' name and sent
them oﬀ.
41 The apostles went out of the
High Council overjoyed because theyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 5 – 6
32
had been given the honor of being
dishonored on account of the Name.
42 Every day they were in the Temple
and homes, teaching and preaching
Christ Jesus, not le ng up for a minute.
1 During this me, as the disciples
were increasing in numbers by
leaps and bounds, hard feelings
developed among the Greek-speaking
believers--"Hellenists"--toward the
Hebrew-speaking believers because
their widows were being discriminated
against in the daily food lines.
2 So the Twelve called a mee ng of the
disciples. They said, "It wouldn't be right
for us to abandon our responsibili es for
preaching and teaching the Word of God
to help with the care of the poor.
3 So, friends, choose seven men from
among you whom everyone trusts, men
full of the Holy Spirit and good sense,
and we'll assign them this task.
6ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
4 Meanwhile, we'll s
33
ck to our assigned
tasks of prayer and speaking God's
Word."
5 The congrega on thought this was
a great idea. They went ahead and
chose--Stephen, a man full of faith and
the Holy Spirit, Philip, Procorus, Nicanor,
Timon, Parmenas, Nicolas, a convert
from An och.
6 Then they presented them to the
apostles. Praying, the apostles laid on
hands and commissioned them for their
task.
7 The Word of God prospered. The
number of disciples in Jerusalem
increased drama cally. Not least, a great
many priests submi ed themselves to
the faith.
8 Stephen, brimming with God's grace
and energy, was doing wonderful things
among the people, unmistakable signs
that God was among them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6
9 But then some men from the mee
34
ng
place whose membership was made up
of freed slaves, Cyrenians, Alexandrians,
and some others from Cilicia and Asia,
went up against him trying to argue him
down.
10 But they were no match for his
wisdom and spirit when he spoke.
11 So in secret they bribed men to lie:
"We heard him cursing Moses and God."
12 That s rred up the people, the
religious leaders, and religion scholars.
They grabbed Stephen and took him
before the High Council
13 They put forward their bribed
witnesses to tes fy: "This man talks
nonstop against this Holy Place and
God's Law.
14 We even heard him say that Jesus
of Nazareth would tear this place down
and throw out all the customs Moses
gave us."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 6 – 7
35
15 As all those who sat on the High
Council looked at Stephen, they found
they couldn't take their eyes oﬀ him--his
face was like the face of an angel!
1 Then the Chief Priest said, "What
do you have to say for yourself?"
2 Stephen replied, "Friends, fathers,
and brothers, the God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham when he was s ll
in Mesopotamia, before the move to
Haran,
3 and told him, 'Leave your country and
family and go to the land I'll show you.'
4 "So he le the country of the Chaldees
and moved to Haran. A er the death of
his father, he immigrated to this country
where you now live,
5 but God gave him nothing, not so
much as a foothold. He did promise to
give the country to him and his son later
on, even though Abraham had no son at
the me.
7ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
36
6 God let him know that his oﬀspring
would move to an alien country where
they would be enslaved and brutalized
for four hundred years.
7 'But,' God said, 'I will step in and take
care of those slaveholders and bring my
people out so they can worship me in
this place.'
8 "Then he made a covenant with
him and signed it in Abraham's ﬂesh
by circumcision. When Abraham had
his son Isaac, within eight days he
reproduced the sign of circumcision in
him. Isaac became father of Jacob, and
Jacob father of twelve 'fathers,' each
faithfully passing on the covenant sign.
9 "But then those 'fathers,' burning up
with jealousy, sent Joseph oﬀ to Egypt as
a slave. God was right there with him,
though--
10 he not only rescued him from all
his troubles but brought him to theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
37
a en on of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He
was so impressed with Joseph that he
put him in charge of the whole country,
including his own personal aﬀairs.
11 "Later a famine descended on that
en re region, stretching from Egypt to
Canaan, bringing terriﬁc hardship. Our
hungry fathers looked high and low for
food, but the cupboard was bare.
12 Jacob heard there was food in Egypt
and sent our fathers to scout it out.
13 Having conﬁrmed the report, they
went back to Egypt a second me to
get food. On that visit, Joseph revealed
his true iden ty to his brothers and
introduced the Jacob family to Pharaoh.
14 Then Joseph sent for his father,
Jacob, and everyone else in the family,
seventy-ﬁve in all.
15 That's how the Jacob family got to
Egypt. "Jacob died, and our fathers a er
him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
38
16 They were taken to Shechem and
buried in the tomb for which Abraham
paid a good price to the sons of Hamor.
17 "When the four hundred years
were nearly up, the me God promised
Abraham for deliverance, the popula on
of our people in Egypt had become very
large.
18 And there was now a king over Egypt
who had never heard of Joseph.
19 He exploited our race mercilessly. He
went so far as forcing us to abandon our
newborn infants, exposing them to the
elements to die a cruel death.
20 "In just such a me Moses was born,
a most beau ful baby. He was hidden at
home for three months.
21 When he could be hidden no longer,
he was put outside--and immediately
rescued by Pharaoh's daughter, who
mothered him as her own son.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
39
22 Moses was educated in the best
schools in Egypt. He was equally
impressive as a thinker and an athlete.
23 "When he was forty years old, he
wondered how everything was going
with his Hebrew kin and went out to
look things over.
24 He saw an Egyp an abusing one
of them and stepped in, avenging his
underdog brother by knocking the
Egyp an ﬂat.
25 He thought his brothers would be
glad that he was on their side, and even
see him as an instrument of God to
deliver them. But they didn't see it that
way.
26 The next day two of them were
ﬁgh ng and he tried to break it up, told
them to shake hands and get along with
each other: 'Friends, you are brothers,
why are you bea ng up on each other?'ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
40
27 "The one who had started the ﬁght
said, 'Who put you in charge of us?
28 Are you going to kill me like you killed
that Egyp an yesterday?'
29 When Moses heard that, realizing
that the word was out, he ran for his life
and lived in exile over in Midian. During
the years of exile, two sons were born to
him.
30 "Forty years later, in the wilderness
of Mount Sinai, an angel appeared to
him in the guise of ﬂames of a burning
bush.
31 Moses, not believing his eyes, went
up to take a closer look. He heard God's
voice:
32 'I am the God of your fathers, the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.'
Frightened nearly out of his skin, Moses
shut his eyes and turned away.
33 "God said, 'Kneel and pray. You are in
a holy place, on holy ground.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
41
34 I've seen the agony of my people in
Egypt. I've heard their groans. I've come
to help them. So get yourself ready; I'm
sending you back to Egypt.'
35 "This is the same Moses whom they
earlier rejected, saying, 'Who put you
in charge of us?' This is the Moses that
God, using the angel ﬂaming in the
burning bush, sent back as ruler and
redeemer.
36 He led them out of their slavery.
He did wonderful things, se ng up
God-signs all through Egypt, down at the
Red Sea, and out in the wilderness for
forty years.
37 This is the Moses who said to
his congrega on, 'God will raise up
a prophet just like me from your
descendants.'
38 This is the Moses who stood between
the angel speaking at Sinai and your
fathers assembled in the wilderness andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
42
took the life-giving words given to him
and handed them over to us,
39 words our fathers would have
nothing to do with. "They craved the old
Egyp an ways,
40 whining to Aaron, 'Make us gods we
can see and follow. This Moses who got
us out here miles from nowhere--who
knows what's happened to him!'
41 That was the me when they made
a calf-idol, brought sacriﬁces to it,
and congratulated each other on the
wonderful religious program they had
put together.
42 "God wasn't at all pleased; but he let
them do it their way, worship every new
god that came down the pike--and live
with the consequences, consequences
described by the prophet Amos: Did you
bring me oﬀerings of animals and grains
those forty wilderness years, O Israel?ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
43
43 Hardly. You were too busy building
shrines to war gods, to sex goddesses,
Worshiping them with all your might.
That's why I put you in exile in Babylon.
44 "And all this me our ancestors had
a tent shrine for true worship, made to
the exact speciﬁca ons God provided
Moses.
45 They had it with them as they
followed Joshua, when God cleared the
land of pagans, and s ll had it right down
to the me of David.
46 David asked God for a permanent
place for worship.
47 But Solomon built it.
48 "Yet that doesn't mean that Most
High God lives in a building made by
carpenters and masons. The prophet
Isaiah put it well when he wrote,
49 "Heaven is my throne room; I rest my
feet on earth. So what kind of house willACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7
44
you build me?" says God. "Where I can
get away and relax?
50 It's already built, and I built it."
51 "And you con nue, so bullheaded!
Calluses on your hearts, ﬂaps on your
ears! Deliberately ignoring the Holy
Spirit, you're just like your ancestors.
52 Was there ever a prophet who didn't
get the same treatment? Your ancestors
killed anyone who dared talk about the
coming of the Just One. And you've kept
up the family tradi on--traitors and
murderers, all of you.
53 You had God's Law handed to you
by angels--gi -wrapped!--and you
squandered it!"
54 At that point they went wild, a
rio ng mob of catcalls and whistles and
invec ve.
55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit,
hardly no ced--he only had eyes forACTS OF THE APOSTLES 7 – 8
45
God, whom he saw in all his glory with
Jesus standing at his side.
56 He said, "Oh! I see heaven wide open
and the Son of Man standing at God's
side!"
57 Yelling and hissing, the mob drowned
him out. Now in full stampede,
58 they dragged him out of town and
pelted him with rocks. The ringleaders
took oﬀ their coats and asked a young
man named Saul to watch them.
59 As the rocks rained down, Stephen
prayed, "Master Jesus, take my life."
60 Then he knelt down, praying loud
enough for everyone to hear, "Master,
don't blame them for this sin"--his last
words. Then he died. Saul was right
there, congratula ng the killers.
1 That set oﬀ a terriﬁc persecu on
of the church in Jerusalem. The
believers were all sca ered throughout
8ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
46
Judea and Samaria. All, that is, but the
apostles.
2 Good and brave men buried Stephen,
giving him a solemn funeral--not many
dry eyes that day!
3 And Saul just went wild, devasta ng
the church, entering house a er house
a er house, dragging men and women
oﬀ to jail.
4 Forced to leave home base, the
Chris ans all became missionaries.
Wherever they were sca ered, they
preached the Message about Jesus.
5 Going down to a Samaritan city, Philip
proclaimed the Message of the Messiah.
6 When the people heard what he had
to say and saw the miracles, the clear
signs of God's ac on, they hung on his
every word.
7 Many who could neither stand nor
walk were healed that day. The evilACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
47
spirits protested loudly as they were
sent on their way.
8 And what joy in the city!
9 Previous to Philip's arrival, a certain
Simon had prac ced magic in the city,
posing as a famous man and dazzling all
the Samaritans with his wizardry.
10 He had them all, from li le children
to old men, ea ng out of his hand. They
all thought he had supernatural powers,
and called him "the Great Wizard."
11 He had been around a long me and
everyone was more or less in awe of
him.
12 But when Philip came to town
announcing the news of God's kingdom
and proclaiming the name of Jesus
Christ, they forgot Simon and were
bap zed, becoming believers right and
le !
13 Even Simon himself believed and was
bap zed. From that moment he wasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
48
like Philip's shadow, so fascinated with
all the God-signs and miracles that he
wouldn't leave Philip's side.
14 When the apostles in Jerusalem
received the report that Samaria had
accepted God's Message, they sent Peter
and John down
15 to pray for them to receive the Holy
Spirit.
16 Up to this point they had only been
bap zed in the name of the Master
Jesus; the Holy Spirit hadn't yet fallen on
them.
17 Then the apostles laid their hands
on them and they did receive the Holy
Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the apostles
by merely laying on hands conferred the
Spirit, he pulled out his money, excited,
19 and said, "Sell me your secret! Show
me how you did that! How much do you
want? Name your price!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
49
20 Peter said, "To hell with your money!
And you along with it. Why, that's
unthinkable--trying to buy God's gi !
21 You'll never be part of what God is
doing by striking bargains and oﬀering
bribes.
22 Change your ways--and now! Ask the
Master to forgive you for trying to use
God to make money.
23 I can see this is an old habit with you;
you reek with money-lust."
24 "Oh!" said Simon, "pray for me! Pray
to the Master that nothing like that will
ever happen to me!"
25 And with that, the apostles were on
their way, con nuing to witness and
spread the Message of God's salva on,
preaching in every Samaritan town
they passed through on their return to
Jerusalem.
26 Later God's angel spoke to Philip:
"At noon today I want you to walk overACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
50
to that desolate road that goes from
Jerusalem down to Gaza."
27 He got up and went. He met an
Ethiopian eunuch coming down the road.
The eunuch had been on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem and was returning to Ethiopia,
where he was minister in charge of all
the ﬁnances of Candace, queen of the
Ethiopians.
28 He was riding in a chariot and reading
the prophet Isaiah.
29 The Spirit told Philip, "Climb into the
chariot."
30 Running up alongside, Philip heard
the eunuch reading Isaiah and asked,
"Do you understand what you're
reading?"
31 He answered, "How can I without
some help?" and invited Philip into the
chariot with him.
32 The passage he was reading was this:
As a sheep led to slaughter, and quietACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8
51
as a lamb being sheared, He was silent,
saying nothing.
33 He was mocked and put down, never
got a fair trial. But who now can count
his kin since he's been taken from the
earth?
34 The eunuch said, "Tell me, who is the
prophet talking about: himself or some
other?"
35 Philip grabbed his chance. Using this
passage as his text, he preached Jesus to
him.
36 As they con nued down the road,
they came to a stream of water. The
eunuch said, "Here's water. Why can't I
be bap zed?"
38 He ordered the chariot to stop. They
both went down to the water, and Philip
bap zed him on the spot.
39 When they came up out of the water,
the Spirit of God suddenly took Philip
oﬀ, and that was the last the eunuch sawACTS OF THE APOSTLES 8 – 9
52
of him. But he didn't mind. He had what
he'd come for and went on down the
road as happy as he could be.
40 Philip showed up in Azotus and
con nued north, preaching the Message
in all the villages along that route un l
he arrived at Caesarea.
1 All this me Saul was breathing
down the necks of the Master's
disciples, out for the kill. He went to the
Chief Priest
2 and got arrest warrants to take to
the mee ng places in Damascus so that
if he found anyone there belonging to
the Way, whether men or women, he
could arrest them and bring them to
Jerusalem.
3 He set oﬀ. When he got to the
outskirts of Damascus, he was suddenly
dazed by a blinding ﬂash of light.
9ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
53
4 As he fell to the ground, he heard a
voice: "Saul, Saul, why are you out to get
me?"
5 He said, "Who are you, Master?" "I
am Jesus, the One you're hun ng down.
6 I want you to get up and enter the
city. In the city you'll be told what to do
next."
7 His companions stood there
dumbstruck--they could hear the sound,
but couldn't see anyone--
8 while Saul, picking himself up oﬀ the
ground, found himself stone blind. They
had to take him by the hand and lead
him into Damascus.
9 He con nued blind for three days. He
ate nothing, drank nothing.
10 There was a disciple in Damascus
by the name of Ananias. The Master
spoke to him in a vision: "Ananias." "Yes,
Master?" he answered.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
54
11 "Get up and go over to Straight
Avenue. Ask at the house of Judas for a
man from Tarsus. His name is Saul. He's
there praying.
12 He has just had a dream in which he
saw a man named Ananias enter the
house and lay hands on him so he could
see again."
13 Ananias protested, "Master, you can't
be serious. Everybody's talking about
this man and the terrible things he's
been doing, his reign of terror against
your people in Jerusalem!
14 And now he's shown up here with
papers from the Chief Priest that give
him license to do the same to us."
15 But the Master said, "Don't argue.
Go! I have picked him as my personal
representa ve to Gen les and kings and
Jews.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
55
16 And now I'm about to show him what
he's in for--the hard suﬀering that goes
with this job."
17 So Ananias went and found the
house, placed his hands on blind Saul,
and said, "Brother Saul, the Master sent
me, the same Jesus you saw on your way
here. He sent me so you could see again
and be ﬁlled with the Holy Spirit."
18 No sooner were the words out of his
mouth than something like scales fell
from Saul's eyes--he could see again! He
got to his feet, was bap zed,
19 and sat down with them to a hearty
meal. Saul spent a few days ge ng
acquainted with the Damascus disciples,
20 but then went right to work, was ng
no me, preaching in the mee ng places
that this Jesus was the Son of God.
21 They were caught oﬀ guard by this
and, not at all sure they could trust him,
they kept saying, "Isn't this the man whoACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
56
wreaked havoc in Jerusalem among the
believers? And didn't he come here to
do the same thing--arrest us and drag us
oﬀ to jail in Jerusalem for sentencing by
the high priests?"
22 But their suspicions didn't slow Saul
down for even a minute. His momentum
was up now and he plowed straight into
the opposi on, disarming the Damascus
Jews and trying to show them that this
Jesus was the Messiah.
23 A er this had gone on quite a long
me, some Jews conspired to kill him,
24 but Saul got wind of it. They were
watching the city gates around the clock
so they could kill him.
25 Then one night the disciples
engineered his escape by lowering him
over the wall in a basket.
26 Back in Jerusalem he tried to join the
disciples, but they were all afraid of him.
They didn't trust him one bit.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
57
27 Then Barnabas took him under his
wing. He introduced him to the apostles
and stood up for him, told them how
Saul had seen and spoken to the Master
on the Damascus Road and how in
Damascus itself he had laid his life on
the line with his bold preaching in Jesus'
name.
28 A er that he was accepted as one
of them, going in and out of Jerusalem
with no ques ons asked, uninhibited as
he preached in the Master's name.
29 But then he ran afoul of a group
called Hellenists--he had been engaged
in a running argument with them--who
plo ed his murder.
30 When his friends learned of the plot,
they got him out of town, took him to
Caesarea, and then shipped him oﬀ to
Tarsus.
31 Things calmed down a er that and
the church had smooth sailing for aACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
58
while. All over the country--Judea,
Samaria, Galilee--the church grew. They
were permeated with a deep sense of
reverence for God. The Holy Spirit was
with them, strengthening them. They
prospered wonderfully.
32 Peter went oﬀ on a mission to visit all
the churches. In the course of his travels
he arrived in Lydda and met with the
believers there.
33 He came across a man--his name
was Aeneas--who had been in bed eight
years paralyzed.
34 Peter said, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ
heals you. Get up and make your bed!"
And he did it--jumped right out of bed.
35 Everybody who lived in Lydda and
Sharon saw him walking around and
woke up to the fact that God was alive
and ac ve among them.
36 Down the road a way in Joppa there
was a disciple named Tabitha, "Gazelle"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9
59
in our language. She was well-known for
doing good and helping out.
37 During the me Peter was in the area
she became sick and died. Her friends
prepared her body for burial and put her
in a cool room.
38 Some of the disciples had heard that
Peter was visi ng in nearby Lydda and
sent two men to ask if he would be so
kind as to come over.
39 Peter got right up and went with
them. They took him into the room
where Tabitha's body was laid out. Her
old friends, most of them widows, were
in the room mourning. They showed
Peter pieces of clothing the Gazelle had
made while she was with them.
40 Peter put the widows all out of the
room. He knelt and prayed. Then he
spoke directly to the body: "Tabitha, get
up." She opened her eyes. When she
saw Peter, she sat up.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 9 – 10
60
41 He took her hand and helped her
up. Then he called in the believers and
widows, and presented her to them
alive.
42 When this became known all over
Joppa, many put their trust in the
Master.
43 Peter stayed on a long me in Joppa
as a guest of Simon the Tanner.
1 There was a man named
Cornelius who lived in Caesarea,
captain of the Italian Guard sta oned
there.
2 He was a thoroughly good man. He
had led everyone in his house to live
worshipfully before God, was always
helping people in need, and had the
habit of prayer.
3 One day about three o'clock in the
a ernoon he had a vision. An angel of
God, as real as his next-door neighbor,
came in and said, "Cornelius."
10ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
61
4 Cornelius stared hard, wondering
if he was seeing things. Then he said,
"What do you want, sir?" The angel said,
"Your prayers and neighborly acts have
brought you to God's a en on.
5 Here's what you are to do. Send men
to Joppa to get Simon, the one everyone
calls Peter.
6 He is staying with Simon the Tanner,
whose house is down by the sea."
7 As soon as the angel was gone,
Cornelius called two servants and one
par cularly devout soldier from the
guard.
8 He went over with them in great detail
everything that had just happened, and
then sent them oﬀ to Joppa.
9 The next day as the three travelers
were approaching the town, Peter went
out on the balcony to pray. It was about
noon.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
62
10 Peter got hungry and started thinking
about lunch. While lunch was being
prepared, he fell into a trance.
11 He saw the skies open up. Something
that looked like a huge blanket lowered
by ropes at its four corners se led on
the ground.
12 Every kind of animal and rep le and
bird you could think of was on it.
13 Then a voice came: "Go to it,
Peter--kill and eat."
14 Peter said, "Oh, no, Lord. I've never
so much as tasted food that was not
kosher."
15 The voice came a second me: "If
God says it's okay, it's okay."
16 This happened three mes, and then
the blanket was pulled back up into the
skies.
17 As Peter, puzzled, sat there trying to
ﬁgure out what it all meant, the menACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
63
sent by Cornelius showed up at Simon's
front door.
18 They called in, asking if there was a
Simon, also called Peter, staying there.
19 Peter, lost in thought, didn't hear
them, so the Spirit whispered to him,
"Three men are knocking at the door
looking for you.
20 Get down there and go with them.
Don't ask any ques ons. I sent them to
get you."
21 Peter went down and said to the
men, "I think I'm the man you're looking
for. What's up?"
22 They said, "Captain Cornelius, a
God-fearing man well-known for his
fair play--ask any Jew in this part of the
country--was commanded by a holy
angel to get you and bring you to his
house so he could hear what you had to
say."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
64
23 Peter invited them in and made them
feel at home. The next morning he got
up and went with them. Some of his
friends from Joppa went along.
24 A day later they entered Caesarea.
Cornelius was expec ng them and had
his rela ves and close friends wai ng
with him.
25 The minute Peter came through
the door, Cornelius was up on his feet
gree ng him--and then down on his face
worshiping him!
26 Peter pulled him up and said, "None
of that--I'm a man and only a man, no
diﬀerent from you."
27 Talking things over, they went on into
the house, where Cornelius introduced
Peter to everyone who had come.
28 Peter addressed them, "You know,
I'm sure that this is highly irregular. Jews
just don't do this--visit and relax with
people of another race. But God has justACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
65
shown me that no race is be er than any
other.
29 So the minute I was sent for, I came,
no ques ons asked. But now I'd like to
know why you sent for me."
30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago at
about this me, mida ernoon, I was
home praying. Suddenly there was a
man right in front of me, ﬂooding the
room with light.
31 He said, 'Cornelius, your daily prayers
and neighborly acts have brought you to
God's a en on.
32 I want you to send to Joppa to get
Simon, the one they call Peter. He's
staying with Simon the Tanner down by
the sea.'
33 "So I did it--I sent for you. And you've
been good enough to come. And now
we're all here in God's presence, ready
to listen to whatever the Master put in
your heart to tell us."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
66
34 Peter fairly exploded with his good
news: "It's God's own truth, nothing
could be plainer: God plays no favorites!
35 It makes no diﬀerence who you are
or where you're from--if you want God
and are ready to do as he says, the door
is open.
36 The Message he sent to the children
of Israel--that through Jesus Christ
everything is being put together again-
-well, he's doing it everywhere, among
everyone.
37 "You know the story of what
happened in Judea. It began in Galilee
a er John preached a total life-change.
38 Then Jesus arrived from Nazareth,
anointed by God with the Holy Spirit,
ready for ac on. He went through the
country helping people and healing
everyone who was beaten down by the
Devil. He was able to do all this because
God was with him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10
67
39 "And we saw it, saw it all, everything
he did in the land of the Jews and in
Jerusalem where they killed him, hung
him from a cross.
40 But in three days God had him up,
alive, and out where he could be seen.
41 Not everyone saw him--he wasn't
put on public display. Witnesses had
been carefully handpicked by God
beforehand--us! We were the ones,
there to eat and drink with him a er he
came back from the dead.
42 He commissioned us to announce
this in public, to bear solemn witness
that he is in fact the One whom God
des ned as Judge of the living and dead.
43 But we're not alone in this. Our
witness that he is the means to
forgiveness of sins is backed up by the
witness of all the prophets."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 10 – 11 68
44 No sooner were these words out of
Peter's mouth than the Holy Spirit came
on the listeners.
45 The believing Jews who had come
with Peter couldn't believe it, couldn't
believe that the gi of the Holy Spirit
was poured out on "outsider" Gen les,
46 but there it was--they heard them
speaking in tongues, heard them praising
God. Then Peter said,
47 "Do I hear any objec ons to bap zing
these friends with water? They've
received the Holy Spirit exactly as we
did."
48 Hearing no objec ons, he ordered
that they be bap zed in the name of
Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to
stay on for a few days.
1 The news traveled fast and in no
me the leaders and friends back
in Jerusalem heard about it--heard that
11ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
69
the non-Jewish "outsiders" were now
"in."
2 When Peter got back to Jerusalem,
some of his old associates, concerned
about circumcision, called him on the
carpet:
3 "What do you think you're doing
rubbing shoulders with that crowd,
ea ng what is prohibited and ruining our
good name?"
4 So Peter, star ng from the beginning,
laid it out for them step-by-step:
5 "Recently I was in the town of Joppa
praying. I fell into a trance and saw a
vision: Something like a huge blanket,
lowered by ropes at its four corners,
came down out of heaven and se led on
the ground in front of me.
6 Milling around on the blanket were
farm animals, wild animals, rep les,
birds--you name it, it was there.
Fascinated, I took it all in.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
70
7 "Then I heard a voice: 'Go to it,
Peter--kill and eat.'
8 I said, 'Oh, no, Master. I've never so
much as tasted food that wasn't kosher.'
9 The voice spoke again: 'If God says it's
okay, it's okay.'
10 This happened three mes, and then
the blanket was pulled back up into the
sky.
11 "Just then three men showed up at
the house where I was staying, sent from
Caesarea to get me.
12 The Spirit told me to go with them,
no ques ons asked. So I went with them,
I and six friends, to the man who had
sent for me.
13 He told us how he had seen an
angel right in his own house, real as his
next-door neighbor, saying, 'Send to
Joppa and get Simon, the one they call
Peter.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
71
14 He'll tell you something that will save
your life--in fact, you and everyone you
care for.'
15 "So I started in, talking. Before I'd
spoken half a dozen sentences, the Holy
Spirit fell on them just as he did on us
the ﬁrst me.
16 I remembered Jesus' words: 'John
bap zed with water; you will be bap zed
with the Holy Spirit.'
17 So I ask you: If God gave the same
exact gi to them as to us when we
believed in the Master Jesus Christ, how
could I object to God?"
18 Hearing it all laid out like that, they
quieted down. And then, as it sank in,
they started praising God. "It's really
happened! God has broken through to
the other na ons, opened them up to
Life!"
19 Those who had been sca ered by
the persecu on triggered by Stephen'sACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
72
death traveled as far as Phoenicia,
Cyprus, and An och, but they were s ll
only speaking and dealing with their
fellow Jews.
20 Then some of the men from Cyprus
and Cyrene who had come to An och
started talking to Greeks, giving them
the Message of the Master Jesus.
21 God was pleased with what they
were doing and put his stamp of approval
on it--quite a number of the Greeks
believed and turned to the Master.
22 When the church in Jerusalem got
wind of this, they sent Barnabas to
An och to check on things.
23 As soon as he arrived, he saw that
God was behind and in it all. He threw
himself in with them, got behind them,
urging them to stay with it the rest of
their lives.
24 He was a good man that way,
enthusias c and conﬁdent in the HolyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11
73
Spirit's ways. The community grew large
and strong in the Master.
25 Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to
look for Saul.
26 He found him and brought him
back to An och. They were there a
whole year, mee ng with the church
and teaching a lot of people. It was in
An och that the disciples were for the
ﬁrst me called Chris ans.
27 It was about this same me that
some prophets came to An och from
Jerusalem.
28 One of them named Agabus stood
up one day and, prompted by the Spirit,
warned that a severe famine was about
to devastate the country. (The famine
eventually came during the rule of
Claudius.)
29 So the disciples decided that each of
them would send whatever they couldACTS OF THE APOSTLES 11 – 12 74
to their fellow Chris ans in Judea to help
out.
30 They sent Barnabas and Saul to
deliver the collec on to the leaders in
Jerusalem.
1 That's when King Herod got it
into his head to go a er some of
the church members.
2 He murdered James, John's brother.
3 When he saw how much it raised
his popularity ra ngs with the Jews, he
arrested Peter--all this during Passover
Week, mind you--
4 and had him thrown in jail, pu ng
four squads of four soldiers each to
guard him. He was planning a public
lynching a er Passover.
5 All the me that Peter was under
heavy guard in the jailhouse, the church
prayed for him most strenuously.
6 Then the me came for Herod to
bring him out for the kill. That night,
12ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
75
even though shackled to two soldiers,
one on either side, Peter slept like a
baby. And there were guards at the door
keeping their eyes on the place. Herod
was taking no chances!
7 Suddenly there was an angel at his
side and light ﬂooding the room. The
angel shook Peter and got him up:
"Hurry!" The handcuﬀs fell oﬀ his wrists.
8 The angel said, "Get dressed. Put on
your shoes." Peter did it. Then, "Grab
your coat and let's get out of here."
9 Peter followed him, but didn't believe
it was really an angel--he thought he was
dreaming.
10 Past the ﬁrst guard and then the
second, they came to the iron gate that
led into the city. It swung open before
them on its own, and they were out on
the street, free as the breeze. At the ﬁrst
intersec on the angel le him, going his
own way.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
76
11 That's when Peter realized it was
no dream. "I can't believe it--this really
happened! The Master sent his angel
and rescued me from Herod's vicious
li le produc on and the spectacle the
Jewish mob was looking forward to."
12 S ll shaking his head, amazed, he
went to Mary's house, the Mary who
was John Mark's mother. The house was
packed with praying friends.
13 When he knocked on the door to
the courtyard, a young woman named
Rhoda came to see who it was.
14 But when she recognized his voice-
-Peter's voice!--she was so excited and
eager to tell everyone Peter was there
that she forgot to open the door and le
him standing in the street.
15 But they wouldn't believe her,
dismissing her, dismissing her report.
"You're crazy," they said. She stuck by
her story, insis ng. They s ll wouldn'tACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
77
believe her and said, "It must be his
angel."
16 All this me poor Peter was standing
out in the street, knocking away. Finally
they opened up and saw him--and went
wild!
17 Peter put his hands up and calmed
them down. He described how the
Master had go en him out of jail, then
said, "Tell James and the brothers what's
happened." He le them and went oﬀ to
another place.
18 At daybreak the jail was in an uproar.
"Where is Peter? What's happened to
Peter?"
19 When Herod sent for him and they
could neither produce him nor explain
why not, he ordered their execu on:
"Oﬀ with their heads!" Fed up with
Judea and Jews, he went for a vaca on
to Caesarea.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12
78
20 But things went from bad to worse
for Herod. Now people from Tyre and
Sidon put him on the warpath. But they
got Blastus, King Herod's right-hand
man, to put in a good word for them and
got a delega on together to iron things
out. Because they were dependent on
Judea for food supplies, they couldn't
aﬀord to let this go on too long.
21 On the day set for their mee ng,
Herod, robed in pomposity, took his
place on the throne and regaled them
with a lot of hot air.
22 The people played their part to the
hilt and shouted ﬂa eries: "The voice of
God! The voice of God!"
23 That was the last straw. God had had
enough of Herod's arrogance and sent
an angel to strike him down. Herod had
given God no credit for anything. Down
he went. Ro en to the core, a maggoty
old man if there ever was one, he died.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 12 – 13 79
24 Meanwhile, the ministry of God's
Word grew by leaps and bounds.
25 Barnabas and Saul, once they had
delivered the relief oﬀering to the church
in Jerusalem, went back to An och. This
me they took John with them, the one
they called Mark.
1 The congrega on in An och
was blessed with a number
of prophet-preachers and teachers:
Barnabas, Simon, nicknamed Niger,
Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen, an advisor
to the ruler Herod, Saul.
2 One day as they were worshiping
God--they were also fas ng as they
waited for guidance--the Holy Spirit
spoke: "Take Barnabas and Saul and
commission them for the work I have
called them to do."
3 So they commissioned them. In that
circle of intensity and obedience, of
13ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
80
fas ng and praying, they laid hands on
their heads and sent them oﬀ.
4 Sent oﬀ on their new assignment by
the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went
down to Seleucia and caught a ship for
Cyprus.
5 The ﬁrst thing they did when they put
in at Salamis was preach God's Word
in the Jewish mee ng places. They had
John along to help out as needed.
6 They traveled the length of the island,
and at Paphos came upon a Jewish
wizard
7 who had worked himself into the
conﬁdence of the governor, Sergius
Paulus, an intelligent man not easily
taken in by charlatans. The wizard's
name was Bar-Jesus. He was as crooked
as a corkscrew. The governor invited
Barnabas and Saul in, wan ng to hear
God's Word ﬁrsthand from them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
81
8 But Dr. Know-It-All (that's the wizard's
name in plain English) s rred up a
ruckus, trying to divert the governor
from becoming a believer.
9 But Saul (or Paul), full of the Holy
Spirit and looking him straight in the eye,
said,
10 "You bag of wind, you parody of a
devil--why, you stay up nights inven ng
schemes to cheat people out of God.
11 But now you've come up against God
himself, and your game is up. You're
about to go blind--no sunlight for you
for a good long stretch." He was plunged
immediately into a shadowy mist and
stumbled around, begging people to
take his hand and show him the way.
12 When the governor saw what
happened, he became a believer, full of
enthusiasm over what they were saying
about the Master.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
82
13 From Paphos, Paul and company
put out to sea, sailing on to Perga in
Pamphylia. That's where John called it
quits and went back to Jerusalem.
14 From Perga the rest of them traveled
on to An och in Pisidia. On the Sabbath
they went to the mee ng place and took
their places.
15 A er the reading of the Scriptures-
-God's Law and the Prophets--the
president of the mee ng asked them,
"Friends, do you have anything you
want to say? A word of encouragement,
perhaps?"
16 Paul stood up, paused and took a
deep breath, then said, "Fellow Israelites
and friends of God, listen.
17 God took a special interest in our
ancestors, pulled our people who were
beaten down in Egyp an exile to their
feet, and led them out of there in grand
style.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
83
18 He took good care of them for
nearly forty years in that godforsaken
wilderness
19 and then, having wiped out seven
enemies who stood in the way, gave
them the land of Canaan for their very
own--
20 a span in all of about four hundred
ﬁ y years. "Up to the me of Samuel the
prophet, God provided judges to lead
them.
21 But then they asked for a king, and
God gave them Saul, son of Kish, out of
the tribe of Benjamin. A er Saul had
ruled forty years,
22 God removed him from oﬃce and
put King David in his place, with this
commenda on: 'I've searched the land
and found this David, son of Jesse. He's
a man whose heart beats to my heart, a
man who will do what I tell him.'ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
84
23 "From out of David's descendants
God produced a Savior for Israel, Jesus,
exactly as he promised--
24 but only a er John had thoroughly
alerted the people to his arrival by
preparing them for a total life-change.
25 As John was ﬁnishing up his work,
he said, 'Did you think I was the One?
No, I'm not the One. But the One you've
been wai ng for all these years is just
around the corner, about to appear. And
I'm about to disappear.'
26 "Dear brothers and sisters, children
of Abraham, and friends of God, this
message of salva on has been precisely
targeted to you.
27 The ci zens and rulers in Jerusalem
didn't recognize who he was and
condemned him to death.
28 They couldn't ﬁnd a good reason,
but demanded that Pilate execute him
anyway.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
85
29 They did just what the prophets said
they would do, but had no idea they
were following to the le er the script of
the prophets, even though those same
prophets are read every Sabbath in their
mee ng places. "A er they had done
everything the prophets said they would
do, they took him down from the cross
and buried him.
30 And then God raised him from death.
31 There is no dispu ng that--he
appeared over and over again many
mes and places to those who had
known him well in the Galilean years,
and these same people con nue to give
witness that he is alive.
32 "And we're here today bringing you
good news: the Message that what God
promised the fathers
33 has come true for the children--for
us! He raised Jesus, exactly as describedACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
86
in the second Psalm: My Son! My very
own Son! Today I celebrate you!
34 "When he raised him from the dead,
he did it for good--no going back to
that rot and decay for him. That's why
Isaiah said, 'I'll give to all of you David's
guaranteed blessings.'
35 So also the psalmist's prayer: 'You'll
never let your Holy One see death's rot
and decay.'
36 "David, of course, having completed
the work God set out for him, has been
in the grave, dust and ashes, a long me
now.
37 But the One God raised up--no dust
and ashes for him!
38 I want you to know, my very dear
friends, that it is on account of this
resurrected Jesus that the forgiveness of
your sins can be promised.
39 He accomplishes, in those who
believe, everything that the Law ofACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
87
Moses could never make good on. But
everyone who believes in this raised-up
Jesus is declared good and right and
whole before God.
40 "Don't take this lightly. You don't
want the prophet's sermon to describe
you:
41 Watch out, cynics; Look hard--watch
your world fall to pieces. I'm doing
something right before your eyes That
you won't believe, though it's staring
you in the face."
42 When the service was over, Paul and
Barnabas were invited back to preach
again the next Sabbath.
43 As the mee ng broke up, a good
many Jews and converts to Judaism
went along with Paul and Barnabas, who
urged them in long conversa ons to s ck
with what they'd started, this living in
and by God's grace.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13
88
44 When the next Sabbath came
around, prac cally the whole city
showed up to hear the Word of God.
45 Some of the Jews, seeing the crowds,
went wild with jealousy and tore into
Paul, contradic ng everything he was
saying, making an ugly scene.
46 But Paul and Barnabas didn't back
down. Standing their ground they said,
"It was required that God's Word be
spoken ﬁrst of all to you, the Jews.
But seeing that you want no part of
it--you've made it quite clear that you
have no taste or inclina on for eternal
life--the door is open to all the outsiders.
And we're on our way through it,
47 following orders, doing what God
commanded when he said, I've set you
up as light to all na ons. You'll proclaim
salva on to the four winds and seven
seas!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 13 – 14 89
48 When the non-Jewish outsiders
heard this, they could hardly believe
their good fortune. All who were
marked out for real life put their trust
in God--they honored God's Word by
receiving that life.
49 And this Message of salva on spread
like wildﬁre all through the region.
50 Some of the Jews convinced the most
respected women and leading men of
the town that their precious way of life
was about to be destroyed. Alarmed,
they turned on Paul and Barnabas and
forced them to leave.
51 Paul and Barnabas shrugged their
shoulders and went on to the next town,
Iconium,
52 brimming with joy and the Holy
Spirit, two happy disciples.
1 When they got to Iconium they
went, as they always did, to the
mee ng place of the Jews and gave their
14ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
90
message. The Message convinced both
Jews and non-Jews--and not just a few,
either.
2 But the unbelieving Jews worked up a
whispering campaign against Paul and
Barnabas, sowing mistrust and suspicion
in the minds of the people in the street.
3 The two apostles were there a
long me, speaking freely, openly,
and conﬁdently as they presented
the clear evidence of God's gi s, God
corrobora ng their work with miracles
and wonders.
4 But then there was a split in public
opinion, some siding with the Jews,
some with the apostles.
5 One day, learning that both the Jews
and non-Jews had been organized by
their leaders to beat them up,
6 they escaped as best they could to the
next towns--Lyconia, Lystra, Derbe, and
that neighborhood--ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
91
7 but then were right back at it again,
ge ng out the Message.
8 There was a man in Lystra who
couldn't walk. He sat there, crippled
since the day of his birth.
9 He heard Paul talking, and Paul,
looking him in the eye, saw that he was
ripe for God's work, ready to believe.
10 So he said, loud enough for everyone
to hear, "Up on your feet!" The man was
up in a ﬂash--jumped up and walked
around as if he'd been walking all his life.
11 When the crowd saw what Paul had
done, they went wild, calling out in their
Lyconian dialect, "The gods have come
down! These men are gods!"
12 They called Barnabas "Zeus" and Paul
"Hermes" (since Paul did most of the
speaking).
13 The priest of the local Zeus shrine
got up a parade--bulls and banners andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
92
people lined right up to the gates, ready
for the ritual of sacriﬁce.
14 When Barnabas and Paul ﬁnally
realized what was going on, they
stopped them. Waving their arms, they
interrupted the parade, calling out,
15 "What do you think you're doing!
We're not gods! We are men just like
you, and we're here to bring you the
Message, to persuade you to abandon
these silly god-supers ons and
embrace God himself, the living God. We
don't make God; he makes us, and all of
this--sky, earth, sea, and everything in
them.
16 "In the genera ons before us, God
let all the diﬀerent na ons go their own
way.
17 But even then he didn't leave them
without a clue, for he made a good
crea on, poured down rain and gave
bumper crops. When your bellies wereACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
93
full and your hearts happy, there was
evidence of good beyond your doing."
18 Talking fast and hard like this, they
prevented them from carrying out the
sacriﬁce that would have honored them
as gods--but just barely.
19 Then some Jews from An och and
Iconium caught up with them and turned
the ﬁckle crowd against them. They beat
Paul unconscious, dragged him outside
the town and le him for dead.
20 But as the disciples gathered around
him, he came to and got up. He went
back into town and the next day le with
Barnabas for Derbe.
21 A er proclaiming the Message in
Derbe and establishing a strong core of
disciples, they retraced their steps to
Lystra, then Iconium, and then An och,
22 pu ng muscle and sinew in the lives
of the disciples, urging them to s ck
with what they had begun to believe andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14
94
not quit, making it clear to them that it
wouldn't be easy: "Anyone signing up for
the kingdom of God has to go through
plenty of hard mes."
23 Paul and Barnabas handpicked
leaders in each church. A er praying--
their prayers intensiﬁed by fas ng--they
presented these new leaders to the
Master to whom they had entrusted
their lives.
24 Working their way back through
Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia
25 and preached in Perga. Finally, they
made it to A alia
26 and caught a ship back to An och,
where it had all started--launched by
God's grace and now safely home by
God's grace. A good piece of work.
27 On arrival, they got the church
together and reported on their trip,
telling in detail how God had used them
to throw the door of faith wide openACTS OF THE APOSTLES 14 – 15 95
so people of all na ons could come
streaming in.
28 Then they se led down for a long,
leisurely visit with the disciples.
1 It wasn't long before some Jews
showed up from Judea insis ng
that everyone be circumcised: "If you're
not circumcised in the Mosaic fashion,
you can't be saved."
2 Paul and Barnabas were up on their
feet at once in ﬁerce protest. The church
decided to resolve the ma er by sending
Paul, Barnabas, and a few others to put
it before the apostles and leaders in
Jerusalem.
3 A er they were sent oﬀ and on their
way, they told everyone they met as they
traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria
about the breakthrough to the Gen le
outsiders. Everyone who heard the news
cheered--it was terriﬁc news!
15ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
96
4 When they got to Jerusalem, Paul and
Barnabas were graciously received by
the whole church, including the apostles
and leaders. They reported on their
recent journey and how God had used
them to open things up to the outsiders.
5 Some Pharisees stood up to say their
piece. They had become believers, but
con nued to hold to the hard party
line of the Pharisees. "You have to
circumcise the pagan converts," they
said. "You must make them keep the Law
of Moses."
6 The apostles and leaders called a
special mee ng to consider the ma er.
7 The arguments went on and on,
back and forth, ge ng more and more
heated. Then Peter took the ﬂoor:
"Friends, you well know that from early
on God made it quite plain that he
wanted the pagans to hear the Message
of this good news and embrace it--andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
97
not in any secondhand or roundabout
way, but ﬁrsthand, straight from my
mouth.
8 And God, who can't be fooled by any
pretense on our part but always knows
a person's thoughts, gave them the Holy
Spirit exactly as he gave him to us.
9 He treated the outsiders exactly as he
treated us, beginning at the very center
of who they were and working from that
center outward, cleaning up their lives
as they trusted and believed him.
10 "So why are you now trying to out-
god God, loading these new believers
down with rules that crushed our
ancestors and crushed us, too?
11 Don't we believe that we are saved
because the Master Jesus amazingly and
out of sheer generosity moved to save
us just as he did those from beyond our
na on? So what are we arguing about?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
98
12 There was dead silence. No one said
a word. With the room quiet, Barnabas
and Paul reported ma er-of-factly on
the miracles and wonders God had done
among the other na ons through their
ministry.
13 The silence deepened; you could
hear a pin drop. James broke the silence.
"Friends, listen.
14 Simeon has told us the story of how
God at the very outset made sure that
racial outsiders were included.
15 This is in perfect agreement with the
words of the prophets:
16 A er this, I'm coming back; I'll rebuild
David's ruined house; I'll put all the
pieces together again; I'll make it look
like new
17 So outsiders who seek will ﬁnd, so
they'll have a place to come to, All the
pagan peoples included in what I'm
doing. "God said it and now he's doing it.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
18 It's no a
99
erthought; he's always
known he would do this.
19 "So here is my decision: We're
not going to unnecessarily burden
non-Jewish people who turn to the
Master.
20 We'll write them a le er and tell
them, 'Be careful to not get involved
in ac vi es connected with idols, to
guard the morality of sex and marriage,
to not serve food oﬀensive to Jewish
Chris ans--blood, for instance.'
21 This is basic wisdom from Moses,
preached and honored for centuries
now in city a er city as we have met and
kept the Sabbath."
22 Everyone agreed: apostles, leaders,
all the people. They picked Judas
(nicknamed Barsabbas) and Silas--they
both carried considerable weight in the
church--and sent them to An och with
Paul and BarnabasACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
23 with this le
100
er: From the apostles
and leaders, your friends, to our friends
in An och, Syria, and Cilicia: Hello!
24 We heard that some men from our
church went to you and said things that
confused and upset you. Mind you, they
had no authority from us; we didn't send
them.
25 We have agreed unanimously to pick
representa ves and send them to you
with our good friends Barnabas and
Paul.
26 We picked men we knew you could
trust, Judas and Silas--they've looked
death in the face me and again for the
sake of our Master Jesus Christ.
27 We've sent them to conﬁrm in a
face-to-face mee ng with you what
we've wri en.
28 It seemed to the Holy Spirit and to
us that you should not be saddled withACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
101
any crushing burden, but be responsible
only for these bare necessi es:
29 Be careful not to get involved
in ac vi es connected with idols;
avoid serving food oﬀensive to Jewish
Chris ans (blood, for instance); and
guard the morality of sex and marriage.
These guidelines are suﬃcient to keep
rela ons congenial between us. And
God be with you!
30 And so oﬀ they went to An och. On
arrival, they gathered the church and
read the le er.
31 The people were greatly relieved and
pleased.
32 Judas and Silas, good preachers both
of them, strengthened their new friends
with many words of courage and hope.
33 Then it was me to go home. They
were sent oﬀ by their new friends with
laughter and embraces all around to
report back to those who had sent them.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15
102
35 Paul and Barnabas stayed on in
An och, teaching and preaching the
Word of God. But they weren't alone.
There were a number of teachers and
preachers at that me in An och.
36 A er a few days of this, Paul said to
Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit all our
friends in each of the towns where we
preached the Word of God. Let's see
how they're doing."
37 Barnabas wanted to take John along,
the John nicknamed Mark.
38 But Paul wouldn't have him; he
wasn't about to take along a qui er
who, as soon as the going got tough, had
jumped ship on them in Pamphylia.
39 Tempers ﬂared, and they ended up
going their separate ways: Barnabas
took Mark and sailed for Cyprus;
40 Paul chose Silas and, oﬀered up by
their friends to the grace of the Master,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 15 – 16 103
41 went to Syria and Cilicia to
build up muscle and sinew in those
congrega ons.
1 Paul came ﬁrst to Derbe, then
Lystra. He found a disciple there
by the name of Timothy, son of a devout
Jewish mother and Greek father.
2 Friends in Lystra and Iconium all said
what a ﬁne young man he was.
3 Paul wanted to recruit him for their
mission, but ﬁrst took him aside and
circumcised him so he wouldn't oﬀend
the Jews who lived in those parts. They
all knew that his father was Greek.
4 As they traveled from town to town,
they presented the simple guidelines
the Jerusalem apostles and leaders had
come up with.
5 That turned out to be most helpful.
Day a er day the congrega ons became
stronger in faith and larger in size.
16ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
104
6 They went to Phrygia, and then on
through the region of Gala a. Their plan
was to turn west into Asia province, but
the Holy Spirit blocked that route.
7 So they went to Mysia and tried to go
north to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus
wouldn't let them go there either.
8 Proceeding on through Mysia, they
went down to the seaport Troas.
9 That night Paul had a dream: A
Macedonian stood on the far shore and
called across the sea, "Come over to
Macedonia and help us!"
10 The dream gave Paul his map. We
went to work at once ge ng things
ready to cross over to Macedonia. All
the pieces had come together. We knew
now for sure that God had called us to
preach the good news to the Europeans.
11 Pu ng out from the harbor at Troas,
we made a straight run for Samothrace.
The next day we ed up at New CityACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
105
12 and walked from there to Philippi,
the main city in that part of Macedonia
and, even more importantly, a Roman
colony. We lingered there several days.
13 On the Sabbath, we le the city and
went down along the river where we had
heard there was to be a prayer mee ng.
We took our place with the women
who had gathered there and talked with
them.
14 One woman, Lydia, was from Thya ra
and a dealer in expensive tex les, known
to be a God-fearing woman. As she
listened with intensity to what was being
said, the Master gave her a trus ng
heart--and she believed!
15 A er she was bap zed, along with
everyone in her household, she said in a
surge of hospitality, "If you're conﬁdent
that I'm in this with you and believe in
the Master truly, come home with meACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
106
and be my guests." We hesitated, but
she wouldn't take no for an answer.
16 One day, on our way to the place of
prayer, a slave girl ran into us. She was
a psychic and, with her fortunetelling,
made a lot of money for the people who
owned her.
17 She started following Paul around,
calling everyone's a en on to us by
yelling out, "These men are working for
the Most High God. They're laying out
the road of salva on for you!"
18 She did this for a number of days un l
Paul, ﬁnally fed up with her, turned and
commanded the spirit that possessed
her, "Out! In the name of Jesus Christ,
get out of her!" And it was gone, just like
that.
19 When her owners saw that their
lucra ve li le business was suddenly
bankrupt, they went a er Paul and Silas,
roughed them up and dragged themACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
107
into the market square. Then the police
arrested them
20 and pulled them into a court with the
accusa on, "These men are disturbing
the peace--dangerous Jewish agitators
21 subver ng our Roman law and
order."
22 By this me the crowd had turned
into a restless mob out for blood. The
judges went along with the mob, had
Paul and Silas's clothes ripped oﬀ and
ordered a public bea ng.
23 A er bea ng them black and blue,
they threw them into jail, telling the
jailkeeper to put them under heavy
guard so there would be no chance of
escape.
24 He did just that--threw them into the
maximum security cell in the jail and
clamped leg irons on them.
25 Along about midnight, Paul and Silas
were at prayer and singing a robustACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
108
hymn to God. The other prisoners
couldn't believe their ears.
26 Then, without warning, a huge
earthquake! The jailhouse to ered,
every door ﬂew open, all the prisoners
were loose.
27 Startled from sleep, the jailer saw
all the doors swinging loose on their
hinges. Assuming that all the prisoners
had escaped, he pulled out his sword
and was about to do himself in, ﬁguring
he was as good as dead anyway,
28 when Paul stopped him: "Don't do
that! We're all s ll here! Nobody's run
away!"
29 The jailer got a torch and ran inside.
Badly shaken, he collapsed in front of
Paul and Silas.
30 He led them out of the jail and asked,
"Sirs, what do I have to do to be saved,
to really live?"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
31 They said, "Put your en
109
re trust in
the Master Jesus. Then you'll live as you
were meant to live--and everyone in
your house included!"
32 They went on to spell out in detail
the story of the Master--the en re family
got in on this part.
33 They never did get to bed that night.
The jailer made them feel at home,
dressed their wounds, and then--he
couldn't wait ll morning!--was bap zed,
he and everyone in his family.
34 There in his home, he had food set
out for a fes ve meal. It was a night to
remember: He and his en re family had
put their trust in God; everyone in the
house was in on the celebra on.
35 At daybreak, the court judges sent
oﬃcers with the instruc ons, "Release
these men."
36 The jailer gave Paul the message,
"The judges sent word that you're freeACTS OF THE APOSTLES 16
110
to go on your way. Congratula ons! Go
in peace!"
37 But Paul wouldn't budge. He told the
oﬃcers, "They beat us up in public and
threw us in jail, Roman ci zens in good
standing! And now they want to get us
out of the way on the sly without anyone
knowing? Nothing doing! If they want us
out of here, let them come themselves
and lead us out in broad daylight."
38 When the oﬃcers reported this, the
judges panicked. They had no idea that
Paul and Silas were Roman ci zens.
39 They hurried over and apologized,
personally escorted them from the jail,
and then asked them if they wouldn't
please leave the city.
40 Walking out of the jail, Paul and Silas
went straight to Lydia's house, saw their
friends again, encouraged them in the
faith, and only then went on their way.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
17
111
1 They took the road south
through Amphipolis and
Apollonia to Thessalonica, where there
was a community of Jews.
2 Paul went to their mee ng place,
as he usually did when he came to a
town, and for three Sabbaths running he
preached to them from the Scriptures.
3 He opened up the texts so they
understood what they'd been reading all
their lives: that the Messiah absolutely
had to be put to death and raised from
the dead--there were no other op ons--
and that "this Jesus I'm introducing you
to is that Messiah."
4 Some of them were won over and
joined ranks with Paul and Silas, among
them a great many God-fearing Greeks
and a considerable number of women
from the aristocracy.
5 But the hard-line Jews became furious
over the conversions. Mad with jealousy,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
112
they rounded up a bunch of brawlers oﬀ
the streets and soon had an ugly mob
terrorizing the city as they hunted down
Paul and Silas. They broke into Jason's
house, thinking that Paul and Silas were
there.
6 When they couldn't ﬁnd them, they
collared Jason and his friends instead
and dragged them before the city
fathers, yelling hysterically, "These
people are out to destroy the world, and
now they've shown up on our doorstep,
a acking everything we hold dear!
7 And Jason is hiding them, these
traitors and turncoats who say Jesus is
king and Caesar is nothing!"
8 The city fathers and the crowd of
people were totally alarmed by what
they heard.
9 They made Jason and his friends post
heavy bail and let them go while they
inves gated the charges.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
113
10 That night, under cover of darkness,
their friends got Paul and Silas out of
town as fast as they could. They sent
them to Berea, where they again met
with the Jewish community.
11 They were treated a lot be er there
than in Thessalonica. The Jews received
Paul's message with enthusiasm and met
with him daily, examining the Scriptures
to see if they supported what he said.
12 A lot of them became believers,
including many Greeks who were
prominent in the community, women
and men of inﬂuence.
13 But it wasn't long before reports got
back to the Thessalonian hard-line Jews
that Paul was at it again, preaching the
Word of God, this me in Berea. They
lost no me responding, and created a
mob scene there, too.
14 With the help of his friends, Paul
gave them the slip--caught a boat andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
114
put out to sea. Silas and Timothy stayed
behind.
15 The men who helped Paul escape got
him as far as Athens and le him there.
Paul sent word back with them to Silas
and Timothy: "Come as quickly as you
can!"
16 The longer Paul waited in Athens for
Silas and Timothy, the angrier he got--all
those idols! The city was a junkyard of
idols.
17 He discussed it with the Jews and
other like-minded people at their
mee ng place. And every day he went
out on the streets and talked with
anyone who happened along.
18 He got to know some of the
Epicurean and Stoic intellectuals pre y
well through these conversa ons. Some
of them dismissed him with sarcasm:
"What an airhead!" But others, listening
to him go on about Jesus and theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
115
resurrec on, were intrigued: "That's a
new slant on the gods. Tell us more."
19 These people got together and asked
him to make a public presenta on over
at the Areopagus, where things were a
li le quieter. They said, "This is a new
one on us. We've never heard anything
quite like it. Where did you come up
with this anyway?
20 Explain it so we can understand."
21 Downtown Athens was a great place
for gossip. There were always people
hanging around, na ves and tourists
alike, wai ng for the latest dbit on most
anything.
22 So Paul took his stand in the open
space at the Areopagus and laid it out
for them. "It is plain to see that you
Athenians take your religion seriously.
23 When I arrived here the other day, I
was fascinated with all the shrines I came
across. And then I found one inscribed,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
116
TO THE GOD NOBODY KNOWS. I'm here
to introduce you to this God so you can
worship intelligently, know who you're
dealing with.
24 "The God who made the world
and everything in it, this Master of sky
and land, doesn't live in custom-made
shrines
25 or need the human race to run
errands for him, as if he couldn't take
care of himself. He makes the creatures;
the creatures don't make him.
26 Star ng from scratch, he made the
en re human race and made the earth
hospitable, with plenty of me and
space for living
27 so we could seek a er God, and not
just grope around in the dark but actually
ﬁnd him. He doesn't play hide-and-seek
with us. He's not remote; he's near.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17
117
28 We live and move in him, can't get
away from him! One of your poets said it
well: 'We're the God-created.'
29 Well, if we are the God-created, it
doesn't make a lot of sense to think we
could hire a sculptor to chisel a god out
of stone for us, does it?
30 "God overlooks it as long as you don't
know any be er--but that me is past.
The unknown is now known, and he's
calling for a radical life-change.
31 He has set a day when the en re
human race will be judged and
everything set right. And he has already
appointed the judge, conﬁrming him
before everyone by raising him from the
dead."
32 At the phrase "raising him from the
dead," the listeners split: Some laughed
at him and walked oﬀ making jokes;
others said, "Let's do this again. We want
to hear more."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 17 – 18 118
33 But that was it for the day, and Paul
le .
34 There were s ll others, it turned out,
who were convinced then and there, and
stuck with Paul--among them Dionysius
the Areopagite and a woman named
Damaris.
1 A er Athens, Paul went to
Corinth.
2 That is where he discovered Aquila,
a Jew born in Pontus, and his wife,
Priscilla. They had just arrived from Italy,
part of the general expulsion of Jews
from Rome ordered by Claudius.
3 Paul moved in with them, and they
worked together at their common trade
of tentmaking.
4 But every Sabbath he was at the
mee ng place, doing his best to convince
both Jews and Greeks about Jesus.
5 When Silas and Timothy arrived from
Macedonia, Paul was able to give all
18ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
119
his me to preaching and teaching,
doing everything he could to persuade
the Jews that Jesus was in fact God's
Messiah.
6 But no such luck. All they did was
argue conten ously and contradict him
at every turn. Totally exasperated, Paul
had ﬁnally had it with them and gave it
up as a bad job. "Have it your way, then,"
he said. "You've made your bed; now lie
in it. From now on I'm spending my me
with the other na ons."
7 He walked out and went to the home
of Ti us Justus, a God-fearing man who
lived right next to the Jews' mee ng
place.
8 But Paul's eﬀorts with the Jews
weren't a total loss, for Crispus, the
mee ng-place president, put his trust
in the Master. His en re family believed
with him. In the course of listening toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
120
Paul, a great many Corinthians believed
and were bap zed.
9 One night the Master spoke to Paul
in a dream: "Keep it up, and don't let
anyone in midate or silence you.
10 No ma er what happens, I'm with
you and no one is going to be able to
hurt you. You have no idea how many
people I have on my side in this city."
11 That was all he needed to s ck it
out. He stayed another year and a half,
faithfully teaching the Word of God to
the Corinthians.
12 But when Gallio was governor of
Achaia province, the Jews got up a
campaign against Paul, hauled him into
court,
13 and ﬁled charges: "This man is
seducing people into acts of worship
that are illegal."
14 Just as Paul was about to defend
himself, Gallio interrupted and said toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
121
the Jews, "If this was a ma er of criminal
conduct, I would gladly hear you out.
15 But it sounds to me like one more
Jewish squabble, another of your endless
hairspli ng quarrels over religion. Take
care of it on your own me. I can't be
bothered with this nonsense,"
16 and he cleared them out of the
courtroom.
17 Now the street rabble turned on
Sosthenes, the new mee ng-place
president, and beat him up in plain sight
of the court. Gallio didn't raise a ﬁnger.
He could not have cared less.
18 Paul stayed a while longer in Corinth,
but then it was me to take leave of his
friends. Saying his good-byes, he sailed
for Syria, Priscilla and Aquila with him.
Before boarding the ship in the harbor
town of Cenchrea, he had his head
shaved as part of a vow he had taken.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
122
19 They landed in Ephesus, where
Priscilla and Aquila got oﬀ and stayed.
Paul le the ship brieﬂy to go to the
mee ng place and preach to the Jews.
20 They wanted him to stay longer, but
he said he couldn't.
21 But a er saying good-bye, he
promised, "I'll be back, God willing."
From Ephesus
22 he sailed to Caesarea. He greeted
the assembly of Chris ans there, and
then went on to An och, comple ng the
journey.
23 A er spending a considerable me
with the An och Chris ans, Paul set oﬀ
again for Gala a and Phrygia, retracing
his old tracks, one town a er another,
pu ng fresh heart into the disciples.
24 A man named Apollos came to
Ephesus. He was a Jew, born in
Alexandria, Egypt, and a terriﬁc speaker,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 18
123
eloquent and powerful in his preaching
of the Scriptures.
25 He was well-educated in the way of
the Master and ﬁery in his enthusiasm.
Apollos was accurate in everything he
taught about Jesus up to a point, but he
only went as far as the bap sm of John.
26 He preached with power in the
mee ng place. When Priscilla and Aquila
heard him, they took him aside and told
him the rest of the story.
27 When Apollos decided to go on to
Achaia province, his Ephesian friends
gave their blessing and wrote a le er
of recommenda on for him, urging
the disciples there to welcome him
with open arms. The welcome paid oﬀ:
Apollos turned out to be a great help
to those who had become believers
through God's immense generosity.
28 He was par cularly eﬀec ve in public
debate with the Jews as he brought outACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
124
proof a er convincing proof from the
Scriptures that Jesus was in fact God's
Messiah.
1 Now, it happened that while
Apollos was away in Corinth,
Paul made his way down through the
mountains, came to Ephesus, and
happened on some disciples there.
2 The ﬁrst thing he said was, "Did
you receive the Holy Spirit when you
believed? Did you take God into your
mind only, or did you also embrace him
with your heart? Did he get inside you?"
"We've never even heard of that--a Holy
Spirit? God within us?"
3 "How were you bap zed, then?"
asked Paul. "In John's bap sm."
4 "That explains it," said Paul. "John
preached a bap sm of radical life-change
so that people would be ready to receive
the One coming a er him, who turned
out to be Jesus. If you've been bap zed
19ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
125
in John's bap sm, you're ready now for
the real thing, for Jesus."
5 And they were. As soon as they heard
of it, they were bap zed in the name of
the Master Jesus.
6 Paul put his hands on their heads and
the Holy Spirit entered them. From that
moment on, they were praising God in
tongues and talking about God's ac ons.
7 Altogether there were about twelve
people there that day.
8 Paul then went straight to the mee ng
place. He had the run of the place for
three months, doing his best to make
the things of the kingdom of God real
and convincing to them.
9 But then resistance began to form
as some of them began spreading evil
rumors through the congrega on about
the Chris an way of life. So Paul le ,
taking the disciples with him, and set upACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
126
shop in the school of Tyrannus, holding
class there daily.
10 He did this for two years, giving
everyone in the province of Asia, Jews
as well as Greeks, ample opportunity to
hear the Message of the Master.
11 God did powerful things through
Paul, things quite out of the ordinary.
12 The word got around and people
started taking pieces of clothing--
handkerchiefs and scarves and the
like--that had touched Paul's skin and
then touching the sick with them. The
touch did it--they were healed and
whole.
13 Some i nerant Jewish exorcists who
happened to be in town at the me tried
their hand at what they assumed to be
Paul's "game." They pronounced the
name of the Master Jesus over vic ms
of evil spirits, saying, "I command you by
the Jesus preached by Paul!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
127
14 The seven sons of a certain Sceva, a
Jewish high priest, were trying to do this
on a man
15 when the evil spirit talked back: "I
know Jesus and I've heard of Paul, but
who are you?"
16 Then the possessed man went
berserk--jumped the exorcists, beat
them up, and tore oﬀ their clothes.
Naked and bloody, they got away as best
they could.
17 It was soon news all over Ephesus
among both Jews and Greeks. The
realiza on spread that God was in
and behind this. Curiosity about Paul
developed into reverence for the Master
Jesus.
18 Many of those who thus believed
came out of the closet and made a clean
break with their secret sorceries.
19 All kinds of witches and warlocks
came out of the woodwork with theirACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
128
books of spells and incanta ons and
made a huge bonﬁre of them. Someone
es mated their worth at ﬁ y thousand
silver coins.
20 In such ways it became evident
that the Word of the Master was now
sovereign and prevailed in Ephesus.
21 A er all this had come to a head,
Paul decided it was me to move on to
Macedonia and Achaia provinces, and
from there to Jerusalem. "Then," he
said, "I'm oﬀ to Rome. I've got to see
Rome!"
22 He sent two of his assistants, Timothy
and Erastus, on to Macedonia while he
stayed for a while and wrapped things
up in Asia.
23 But before he got away, a huge
ruckus occurred over what was now
being referred to as "the Way."
24 A certain silversmith, Demetrius,
conducted a brisk trade in theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
129
manufacture of shrines to the goddess
Artemis, employing a number of ar sans
in his business.
25 He rounded up his workers and
others similarly employed and said,
"Men, you well know that we have a
good thing going here--
26 and you've seen how Paul has barged
in and discredited what we're doing
by telling people that there's no such
thing as a god made with hands. A lot
of people are going along with him, not
only here in Ephesus but all through Asia
province.
27 "Not only is our li le business in
danger of falling apart, but the temple
of our famous goddess Artemis will
certainly end up a pile of rubble as her
glorious reputa on fades to nothing.
And this is no mere local ma er--the
whole world worships our Artemis!"ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
130
28 That set them oﬀ in a frenzy. They ran
into the street yelling, "Great Artemis of
the Ephesians!
29 Great Artemis of the Ephesians!"
They put the whole city in an uproar,
stampeding into the stadium, and
grabbing two of Paul's associates on
the way, the Macedonians Gaius and
Aristarchus.
30 Paul wanted to go in, too, but the
disciples wouldn't let him.
31 Prominent religious leaders in the
city who had become friendly to Paul
concurred: "By no means go near that
mob!"
32 Some were yelling one thing, some
another. Most of them had no idea what
was going on or why they were there.
33 As the Jews pushed Alexander to the
front to try to gain control, diﬀerent
fac ons clamored to get him on their
side. But he brushed them oﬀ andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19
131
quieted the mob with an impressive
sweep of his arms.
34 But the moment he opened his
mouth and they knew he was a Jew,
they shouted him down: "Great Artemis
of the Ephesians! Great Artemis of the
Ephesians!"--on and on and on, for over
two hours.
35 Finally, the town clerk got the mob
quieted down and said, "Fellow ci zens,
is there anyone anywhere who doesn't
know that our dear city Ephesus is
protector of glorious Artemis and her
sacred stone image that fell straight out
of heaven?
36 Since this is beyond contradic on,
you had be er get hold of yourselves.
This is conduct unworthy of Artemis.
37 These men you've dragged in here
have done nothing to harm either our
temple or our goddess.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 19 – 20 132
38 "So if Demetrius and his guild of
ar sans have a complaint, they can take
it to court and make all the accusa ons
they want.
39 If anything else is bothering you,
bring it to the regularly scheduled town
mee ng and let it be se led there.
40 There is no excuse for what's
happened today. We're pu ng our city
in serious danger. Rome, remember,
does not look kindly on rioters."
41 With that, he sent them home.
1 With things back to normal,
Paul called the disciples together
and encouraged them to keep up the
good work in Ephesus. Then, saying his
good-byes, he le for Macedonia.
2 Traveling through the country, passing
from one gathering to another, he gave
constant encouragement, li ing their
spirits and charging them with fresh
hope. Then he came to Greece
20ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
133
3 and stayed on for three months. Just
as he was about to sail for Syria, the Jews
cooked up a plot against him. So he went
the other way, by land back through
Macedonia, and gave them the slip.
4 His companions for the journey
were Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, from
Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus, both
Thessalonians; Gaius from Derbe;
Timothy; and the two from western Asia,
Tychicus and Trophimus.
5 They went on ahead and waited for us
in Troas.
6 Meanwhile, we stayed in Philippi for
Passover Week, and then set sail. Within
ﬁve days we were again in Troas and
stayed a week.
7 We met on Sunday to worship and
celebrate the Master's Supper. Paul
addressed the congrega on. Our plan
was to leave ﬁrst thing in the morning,
but Paul talked on, way past midnight.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
8 We were mee
134
ng in a well-lighted
upper room.
9 A young man named Eutychus was
si ng in an open window. As Paul went
on and on, Eutychus fell sound asleep
and toppled out the third-story window.
When they picked him up, he was dead.
10 Paul went down, stretched himself
on him, and hugged him hard. "No more
crying," he said. "There's life in him yet."
11 Then Paul got up and served the
Master's Supper. And went on telling
stories of the faith un l dawn! On that
note, they le --Paul going one way,
12 the congrega on another, leading the
boy oﬀ alive, and full of life themselves.
13 In the mean me, the rest of us had
gone on ahead to the ship and sailed
for Assos, where we planned to pick up
Paul. Paul wanted to walk there, and so
had made these arrangements earlier.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
135
14 Things went according to plan: We
met him in Assos, took him on board,
and sailed to Mitylene.
15 The next day we put in opposite
Chios, Samos a day later, and then
Miletus.
16 Paul had decided to bypass Ephesus
so that he wouldn't be held up in Asia
province. He was in a hurry to get
to Jerusalem in me for the Feast of
Pentecost, if at all possible.
17 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for
the leaders of the congrega on.
18 When they arrived, he said, "You
know that from day one of my arrival in
Asia I was with you totally--
19 laying my life on the line, serving the
Master no ma er what, pu ng up with
no end of scheming by Jews who wanted
to do me in.
20 I didn't skimp or trim in any way.
Every truth and encouragement thatACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
136
could have made a diﬀerence to you,
you got. I taught you out in public and I
taught you in your homes,
21 urging Jews and Greeks alike to a
radical life-change before God and an
equally radical trust in our Master Jesus.
22 "But there is another urgency before
me now. I feel compelled to go to
Jerusalem. I'm completely in the dark
about what will happen when I get
there.
23 I do know that it won't be any picnic,
for the Holy Spirit has let me know
repeatedly and clearly that there are
hard mes and imprisonment ahead.
24 But that ma ers li le. What ma ers
most to me is to ﬁnish what God started:
the job the Master Jesus gave me of
le ng everyone I meet know all about
this incredibly extravagant generosity of
God.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
137
25 "And so this is good-bye. You're
not going to see me again, nor I you,
you whom I have gone among for so
long proclaiming the news of God's
inaugurated kingdom.
26 I've done my best for you, given you
my all,
27 held back nothing of God's will for
you.
28 "Now it's up to you. Be on your
toes--both for yourselves and your
congrega on of sheep. The Holy Spirit
has put you in charge of these people-
-God's people they are--to guard and
protect them. God himself thought they
were worth dying for.
29 "I know that as soon as I'm gone,
vicious wolves are going to show up and
rip into this ﬂock, men
30 from your very own ranks twis ng
words so as to seduce disciples into
following them instead of Jesus.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20
138
31 So stay awake and keep up your
guard. Remember those three years I
kept at it with you, never le ng up,
pouring my heart out with you, one a er
another.
32 "Now I'm turning you over to God,
our marvelous God whose gracious
Word can make you into what he wants
you to be and give you everything you
could possibly need in this community of
holy friends.
33 "I've never, as you so well know, had
any taste for wealth or fashion.
34 With these bare hands I took care
of my own basic needs and those who
worked with me.
35 In everything I've done, I have
demonstrated to you how necessary it is
to work on behalf of the weak and not
exploit them. You'll not likely go wrong
here if you keep remembering that ourACTS OF THE APOSTLES 20 – 21 139
Master said, 'You're far happier giving
than ge ng.'"
36 Then Paul went down on his knees,
all of them kneeling with him, and
prayed.
37 And then a river of tears. Much
clinging to Paul, not wan ng to let him
go.
38 They knew they would never see him
again--he had told them quite plainly.
The pain cut deep. Then, bravely, they
walked him down to the ship.
1 And so, with the tearful good-
byes behind us, we were on our
way. We made a straight run to Cos,
the next day reached Rhodes, and then
Patara.
2 There we found a ship going direct to
Phoenicia, got on board, and set sail.
3 Cyprus came into view on our le ,
but was soon out of sight as we kept on
course for Syria, and eventually docked
21ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
140
in the port of Tyre. While the cargo was
being unloaded,
4 we looked up the local disciples and
stayed with them seven days. Their
message to Paul, from insight given by
the Spirit, was "Don't go to Jerusalem."
5 When our me was up, they escorted
us out of the city to the docks. Everyone
came along--men, women, children.
They made a farewell party of the
occasion! We all kneeled together on
the beach and prayed.
6 Then, a er another round of saying
good-bye, we climbed on board the ship
while they dri ed back to their homes.
7 A short run from Tyre to Ptolemais
completed the voyage. We greeted our
Chris an friends there and stayed with
them a day.
8 In the morning we went on to
Caesarea and stayed with Philip the
Evangelist, one of "the Seven."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
141
9 Philip had four virgin daughters who
prophesied.
10 A er several days of visi ng, a
prophet from Judea by the name of
Agabus came down to see us.
11 He went right up to Paul, took Paul's
belt, and, in a drama c gesture, ed
himself up, hands and feet. He said,
"This is what the Holy Spirit says: The
Jews in Jerusalem are going to e up the
man who owns this belt just like this and
hand him over to godless unbelievers."
12 When we heard that, we and
everyone there that day begged Paul not
to be stubborn and persist in going to
Jerusalem.
13 But Paul wouldn't budge: "Why all
this hysteria? Why do you insist on
making a scene and making it even
harder for me? You're looking at this
backwards. The issue in Jerusalem is not
what they do to me, whether arrest orACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
142
murder, but what the Master Jesus does
through my obedience. Can't you see
that?"
14 We saw that we weren't making even
a dent in his resolve, and gave up. "It's in
God's hands now," we said. "Master, you
handle it."
15 It wasn't long before we had our
luggage together and were on our way
to Jerusalem.
16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea
went with us and took us to the home of
Mnason, who received us warmly as his
guests. A na ve of Cyprus, he had been
among the earliest disciples.
17 In Jerusalem, our friends, glad to see
us, received us with open arms.
18 The ﬁrst thing next morning, we took
Paul to see James. All the church leaders
were there.
19 A er a me of gree ng and small
talk, Paul told the story, detail by detail,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
143
of what God had done among the
Gen les through his ministry.
20 They listened with delight and
gave God the glory. They had a story
to tell, too: "And just look at what's
been happening here--thousands upon
thousands of God-fearing Jews have
become believers in Jesus! But there's
also a problem because they are more
zealous than ever in observing the laws
of Moses.
21 They've been told that you advise
believing Jews who live surrounded
by Gen les to go light on Moses,
telling them that they don't need to
circumcise their children or keep up the
old tradi ons. This isn't si ng at all well
with them.
22 "We're worried about what will
happen when they discover you're in
town. There's bound to be trouble. So
here is what we want you to do:ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
144
23 There are four men from our
company who have taken a vow
involving ritual puriﬁca on, but have no
money to pay the expenses.
24 Join these men in their vows and
pay their expenses. Then it will become
obvious to everyone that there is nothing
to the rumors going around about you
and that you are in fact scrupulous in
your reverence for the laws of Moses.
25 "In asking you to do this, we're not
going back on our agreement regarding
Gen les who have become believers. We
con nue to hold fast to what we wrote
in that le er, namely, to be careful not to
get involved in ac vi es connected with
idols; to avoid serving food oﬀensive to
Jewish Chris ans; to guard the morality
of sex and marriage."
26 So Paul did it--took the men, joined
them in their vows, and paid their way.
The next day he went to the Temple toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
145
make it oﬃcial and stay there un l the
proper sacriﬁces had been oﬀered and
completed for each of them.
27 When the seven days of their
puriﬁca on were nearly up, some Jews
from around Ephesus spo ed him in the
Temple. At once they turned the place
upside-down. They grabbed Paul
28 and started yelling at the top of their
lungs, "Help! You Israelites, help! This is
the man who is going all over the world
telling lies against us and our religion
and this place. He's even brought Greeks
in here and deﬁled this holy place."
29 (What had happened was that they
had seen Paul and Trophimus, the
Ephesian Greek, walking together in the
city and had just assumed that he had
also taken him to the Temple and shown
him around.)
30 Soon the whole city was in an uproar,
people running from everywhere to theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
146
Temple to get in on the ac on. They
grabbed Paul, dragged him outside, and
locked the Temple gates so he couldn't
get back in and gain sanctuary.
31 As they were trying to kill him, word
came to the captain of the guard, "A
riot! The whole city's boiling over!"
32 He acted swi ly. His soldiers and
centurions ran to the scene at once. As
soon as the mob saw the captain and his
soldiers, they quit bea ng Paul.
33 The captain came up and put Paul
under arrest. He ﬁrst ordered him
handcuﬀed, and then asked who he was
and what he had done.
34 All he got from the crowd were
shouts, one yelling this, another that.
It was impossible to tell one word
from another in the mob hysteria, so
the captain ordered Paul taken to the
military barracks.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 21
147
35 But when they got to the Temple
steps, the mob became so violent that
the soldiers had to carry Paul.
36 As they carried him away, the crowd
followed, shou ng, "Kill him! Kill him!"
37 When they got to the barracks and
were about to go in, Paul said to the
captain, "Can I say something to you?"
He answered, "Oh, I didn't know you
spoke Greek.
38 I thought you were the Egyp an who
not long ago started a riot here, and
then hid out in the desert with his four
thousand thugs."
39 Paul said, "No, I'm a Jew, born in
Tarsus. And I'm a ci zen s ll of that
inﬂuen al city. I have a simple request:
Let me speak to the crowd."
40 Standing on the barracks steps, Paul
turned and held his arms up. A hush fell
over the crowd as Paul began to speak.
He spoke in Hebrew.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
22
148
1 "My dear brothers and fathers,
listen carefully to what I have
to say before you jump to conclusions
about me."
2 When they heard him speaking
Hebrew, they grew even quieter. No
one wanted to miss a word of this. He
con nued,
3 "I am a good Jew, born in Tarsus in the
province of Cilicia, but educated here
in Jerusalem under the exac ng eye of
Rabbi Gamaliel, thoroughly instructed in
our religious tradi ons. And I've always
been passionately on God's side, just as
you are right now.
4 "I went a er anyone connected with
this 'Way,' went at them hammer and
tongs, ready to kill for God. I rounded up
men and women right and le and had
them thrown in prison.
5 You can ask the Chief Priest or anyone
in the High Council to verify this; theyACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
149
all knew me well. Then I went oﬀ to
our brothers in Damascus, armed with
oﬃcial documents authorizing me to
hunt down the Chris ans there, arrest
them, and bring them back to Jerusalem
for sentencing.
6 "As I arrived on the outskirts of
Damascus about noon, a blinding light
blazed out of the skies
7 and I fell to the ground, dazed. I heard
a voice: 'Saul, Saul, why are you out to
get me?'
8 "'Who are you, Master?' I asked. "He
said, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, the One
you're hun ng down.'
9 My companions saw the light, but
they didn't hear the conversa on.
10 "Then I said, 'What do I do now,
Master?' "He said, 'Get to your feet and
enter Damascus. There you'll be told
everything that's been set out for you to
do.'ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
150
11 And so we entered Damascus,
but nothing like the entrance I had
planned--I was blind as a bat and my
companions had to lead me in by the
hand.
12 "And that's when I met Ananias,
a man with a sterling reputa on
in observing our laws--the Jewish
community in Damascus is unanimous
on that score.
13 He came and put his arm on my
shoulder. 'Look up,' he said. I looked,
and found myself looking right into his
eyes--I could see again!
14 "Then he said, 'The God of our
ancestors has handpicked you to be
briefed on his plan of ac on. You've
actually seen the Righteous Innocent
and heard him speak.
15 You are to be a key witness to
everyone you meet of what you've seen
and heard.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
16 So what are you wai
151
ng for? Get
up and get yourself bap zed, scrubbed
clean of those sins and personally
acquainted with God.'
17 "Well, it happened just as Ananias
said. A er I was back in Jerusalem and
praying one day in the Temple, lost in
the presence of God,
18 I saw him, saw God's Righteous
Innocent, and heard him say to me,
'Hurry up! Get out of here as quickly
as you can. None of the Jews here in
Jerusalem are going to accept what you
say about me.'
19 "At ﬁrst I objected: 'Who has
be er creden als? They all know how
obsessed I was with hun ng out those
who believed in you, bea ng them up in
the mee ng places and throwing them
in jail.
20 And when your witness Stephen was
murdered, I was right there, holding theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
152
coats of the murderers and cheering
them on. And now they see me totally
converted. What be er qualiﬁca on
could I have?'
21 "But he said, 'Don't argue. Go.
I'm sending you on a long journey to
outsider Gen les.'"
22 The people in the crowd had listened
a en vely up to this point, but now they
broke loose, shou ng out, "Kill him! He's
an insect! Stomp on him!"
23 They shook their ﬁsts. They ﬁlled the
air with curses.
24 That's when the captain intervened
and ordered Paul taken into the barracks.
By now the captain was thoroughly
exasperated. He decided to interrogate
Paul under torture in order to get to
the bo om of this, to ﬁnd out what he
had done that provoked this outraged
violence.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22
153
25 As they spread-eagled him with
thongs, ge ng him ready for the whip,
Paul said to the centurion standing
there, "Is this legal: torturing a Roman
ci zen without a fair trial?"
26 When the centurion heard that, he
went directly to the captain. "Do you
realize what you've done? This man is a
Roman ci zen!"
27 The captain came back and took
charge. "Is what I hear right? You're a
Roman ci zen?" Paul said, "I certainly
am."
28 The captain was impressed. "I paid a
huge sum for my ci zenship. How much
did it cost you?" "Nothing," said Paul. "It
cost me nothing. I was free from the day
of my birth."
29 That put a stop to the interroga on.
And it put the fear of God into the
captain. He had put a Roman ci zen inACTS OF THE APOSTLES 22 – 23 154
chains and come within a whisker of
pu ng him under torture!
30 The next day, determined to get to
the root of the trouble and know for sure
what was behind the Jewish accusa on,
the captain released Paul and ordered a
mee ng of the high priests and the High
Council to see what they could make
of it. Paul was led in and took his place
before them.
1 Paul surveyed the members of
the council with a steady gaze,
and then said his piece: "Friends, I've
lived with a clear conscience before God
all my life, up to this very moment."
2 That set the Chief Priest Ananias oﬀ.
He ordered his aides to slap Paul in the
face.
3 Paul shot back, "God will slap you
down! What a fake you are! You sit
there and judge me by the Law and then
23ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
155
break the Law by ordering me slapped
around!"
4 The aides were scandalized: "How
dare you talk to God's Chief Priest like
that!"
5 Paul acted surprised. "How was I to
know he was Chief Priest? He doesn't
act like a Chief Priest. You're right,
the Scripture does say, 'Don't speak
abusively to a ruler of the people.'
Sorry."
6 Paul, knowing some of the council
was made up of Sadducees and
others of Pharisees and how they
hated each other, decided to exploit
their antagonism: "Friends, I am a
stalwart Pharisee from a long line of
Pharisees. It's because of my Pharisee
convic ons--the hope and resurrec on
of the dead--that I've been hauled into
this court."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
156
7 The moment he said this, the council
split right down the middle, Pharisees
and Sadducees going at each other in
heated argument.
8 Sadducees have nothing to do with a
resurrec on or angels or even a spirit.
If they can't see it, they don't believe it.
Pharisees believe it all.
9 And so a huge and noisy quarrel broke
out. Then some of the religion scholars
on the Pharisee side shouted down the
others: "We don't ﬁnd anything wrong
with this man! And what if a spirit has
spoken to him? Or maybe an angel?
What if it turns out we're ﬁgh ng against
God?"
10 That was fuel on the ﬁre. The quarrel
ﬂamed up and became so violent the
captain was afraid they would tear Paul
apart, limb from limb. He ordered the
soldiers to get him out of there andACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
157
escort him back to the safety of the
barracks.
11 That night the Master appeared to
Paul: "It's going to be all right. Everything
is going to turn out for the best. You've
been a good witness for me here in
Jerusalem. Now you're going to be my
witness in Rome!"
12 Next day the Jews worked up a plot
against Paul. They took a solemn oath
that they would neither eat nor drink
un l they had killed him.
13 Over forty of them ritually bound
themselves to this murder pact
14 and presented themselves to the
high priests and religious leaders. "We've
bound ourselves by a solemn oath to eat
nothing un l we have killed Paul.
15 But we need your help. Send a
request from the council to the captain
to bring Paul back so that you can
inves gate the charges in more detail.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
158
We'll do the rest. Before he gets
anywhere near you, we'll have killed
him. You won't be involved."
16 Paul's nephew, his sister's son,
overheard them plo ng the ambush. He
went immediately to the barracks and
told Paul.
17 Paul called over one of the centurions
and said, "Take this young man to the
captain. He has something important to
tell him."
18 The centurion brought him to the
captain and said, "The prisoner Paul
asked me to bring this young man to
you. He said he has something urgent to
tell you."
19 The captain took him by the arm
and led him aside privately. "What is it?
What do you have to tell me?"
20 Paul's nephew said, "The Jews have
worked up a plot against Paul. They're
going to ask you to bring Paul to theACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
159
council ﬁrst thing in the morning on the
pretext that they want to inves gate the
charges against him in more detail.
21 But it's a trick to get him out of your
safekeeping so they can murder him.
Right now there are more than forty
men lying in ambush for him. They've all
taken a vow to neither eat nor drink un l
they've killed him. The ambush is set--all
they're wai ng for is for you to send him
over."
22 The captain dismissed the nephew
with a warning: "Don't breathe a word
of this to a soul."
23 The captain called up two centurions.
"Get two hundred soldiers ready to go
immediately to Caesarea. Also seventy
cavalry and two hundred light infantry.
I want them ready to march by nine
o'clock tonight.
24 And you'll need a couple of mules for
Paul and his gear. We're going to presentACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23
160
this man safe and sound to Governor
Felix."
25 Then he wrote this le er:
26 From Claudius Lysias, to the Most
Honorable Governor Felix: Gree ngs!
27 I rescued this man from a Jewish
mob. They had seized him and were
about to kill him when I learned that
he was a Roman ci zen. So I sent in my
soldiers.
28 Wan ng to know what he had done
wrong, I had him brought before their
council.
29 It turned out to be a squabble turned
vicious over some of their religious
diﬀerences, but nothing remotely
criminal.
30 The next thing I knew, they had
cooked up a plot to murder him. I
decided that for his own safety I'd be er
get him out of here in a hurry. So I'm
sending him to you. I'm informing hisACTS OF THE APOSTLES 23 – 24 161
accusers that he's now under your
jurisdic on.
31 The soldiers, following orders,
took Paul that same night to safety in
An patris.
32 In the morning the soldiers returned
to their barracks in Jerusalem, sending
Paul on to Caesarea under guard of the
cavalry.
33 The cavalry entered Caesarea and
handed Paul and the le er over to the
governor.
34 A er reading the le er, the governor
asked Paul what province he came from
and was told "Cilicia."
35 Then he said, "I'll take up your
case when your accusers show up." He
ordered him locked up for the mean me
in King Herod's oﬃcial quarters.
1 Within ﬁve days, the Chief Priest
Ananias arrived with a con ngent
of leaders, along with Tertullus, a trial
24ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
162
lawyer. They presented the governor
with their case against Paul.
2 When Paul was called before
the court, Tertullus spoke for the
prosecu on: "Most Honorable Felix, we
are most grateful in all mes and places
for your wise and gentle rule.
3 We are much aware that it is because
of you and you alone that we enjoy all
this peace and gain daily proﬁt from
your reforms.
4 I'm not going to re you out with a
long speech. I beg your kind indulgence
in listening to me. I'll be quite brief.
5 "We've found this man me and
again disturbing the peace, s rring up
riots against Jews all over the world,
the ringleader of a sedi ous sect called
Nazarenes.
6 He's a real bad apple, I must say. We
caught him trying to deﬁle our holy
Temple and arrested him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
163
8 You'll be able to verify all these
accusa ons when you examine him
yourself."
9 The Jews joined in: "Hear, hear! That's
right!"
10 The governor mo oned to Paul that
it was now his turn. Paul said, "I count
myself fortunate to be defending myself
before you, Governor, knowing how
fair-minded you've been in judging us all
these years.
11 I've been back in the country only
twelve days--you can check out these
dates easily enough. I came with the
express purpose of worshiping in
Jerusalem on Pentecost, and I've been
minding my own business the whole
me.
12 Nobody can say they saw me arguing
in the Temple or working up a crowd in
the streets.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
164
13 Not one of their charges can be
backed up with evidence or witnesses.
14 "But I do freely admit this: In regard
to the Way, which they malign as a
dead-end street, I serve and worship the
very same God served and worshiped
by all our ancestors and embrace
everything wri en in all our Scriptures.
15 And I admit to living in hopeful
an cipa on that God will raise the dead,
both the good and the bad. If that's my
crime, my accusers are just as guilty as I
am.
16 "Believe me, I do my level best to
keep a clear conscience before God and
my neighbors in everything I do.
17 I've been out of the country for a
number of years and now I'm back.
While I was away, I took up a collec on
for the poor and brought that with me,
along with oﬀerings for the Temple.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
165
18 It was while making those oﬀerings
that they found me quietly at my prayers
in the Temple. There was no crowd,
there was no disturbance.
19 It was some Jews from around
Ephesus who started all this trouble.
And you'll no ce they're not here today.
They're cowards, too cowardly to accuse
me in front of you.
20 "So ask these others what crime
they've caught me in. Don't let them hide
behind this smooth-talking Tertullus.
21 The only thing they have on me is
that one sentence I shouted out in the
council: 'It's because I believe in the
resurrec on that I've been hauled into
this court!' Does that sound to you like
grounds for a criminal case?"
22 Felix shilly-shallied. He knew far more
about the Way than he let on, and could
have se led the case then and there. But
uncertain of his best move poli cally, heACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24
166
played for me. "When Captain Lysias
comes down, I'll decide your case."
23 He gave orders to the centurion to
keep Paul in custody, but to more or less
give him the run of the place and not
prevent his friends from helping him.
24 A few days later Felix and his wife,
Drusilla, who was Jewish, sent for Paul
and listened to him talk about a life of
believing in Jesus Christ.
25 As Paul con nued to insist on right
rela ons with God and his people, about
a life of moral discipline and the coming
Judgment, Felix felt things ge ng a li le
too close for comfort and dismissed him.
"That's enough for today. I'll call you
back when it's convenient."
26 At the same me he was secretly
hoping that Paul would oﬀer him a
substan al bribe. These conversa ons
were repeated frequently.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 24 – 25 167
27 A
er two years of this, Felix was
replaced by Porcius Festus. S ll playing
up to the Jews and ignoring jus ce, Felix
le Paul in prison.
1 Three days a er Festus arrived
in Caesarea to take up his du es
as governor, he went up to Jerusalem.
2 The high priests and top leaders
renewed their vende a against Paul.
3 They asked Festus if he wouldn't
please do them a favor by sending Paul
to Jerusalem to respond to their charges.
A lie, of course--they had revived their
old plot to set an ambush and kill him
along the way.
4 Festus answered that Caesarea was
the proper jurisdic on for Paul, and that
he himself was going back there in a few
days.
5 "You're perfectly welcome," he said,
"to go back with me then and accuse
25ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
168
him of whatever you think he's done
wrong."
6 About eight or ten days later, Festus
returned to Caesarea. The next morning
he took his place in the courtroom and
had Paul brought in.
7 The minute he walked in, the Jews
who had come down from Jerusalem
were all over him, hurling the most
extreme accusa ons, none of which they
could prove.
8 Then Paul took the stand and said
simply, "I've done nothing wrong against
the Jewish religion, or the Temple, or
Caesar. Period."
9 Festus, though, wanted to get on the
good side of the Jews and so said, "How
would you like to go up to Jerusalem,
and let me conduct your trial there?"
10 Paul answered, "I'm standing at this
moment before Caesar's bar of jus ce,
where I have a perfect right to stand.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
169
And I'm going to keep standing here. I've
done nothing wrong to the Jews, and
you know it as well as I do.
11 If I've commi ed a crime and deserve
death, name the day. I can face it. But if
there's nothing to their accusa ons--and
you know there isn't--nobody can force
me to go along with their nonsense.
We've fooled around here long enough.
I appeal to Caesar."
12 Festus huddled with his advisors
brieﬂy and then gave his verdict: "You've
appealed to Caesar; you'll go to Caesar!"
13 A few days later King Agrippa and
his wife, Bernice, visited Caesarea to
welcome Festus to his new post.
14 A er several days, Festus brought up
Paul's case to the king. "I have a man on
my hands here, a prisoner le by Felix.
15 When I was in Jerusalem, the high
priests and Jewish leaders brought aACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
170
bunch of accusa ons against him and
wanted me to sentence him to death.
16 I told them that wasn't the way we
Romans did things. Just because a man
is accused, we don't throw him out to
the dogs. We make sure the accused has
a chance to face his accusers and defend
himself of the charges.
17 So when they came down here I got
right on the case. I took my place in
the courtroom and put the man on the
stand.
18 "The accusers came at him from all
sides,
19 but their accusa ons turned out to
be nothing more than arguments about
their religion and a dead man named
Jesus, who the prisoner claimed was
alive.
20 Since I'm a newcomer here and don't
understand everything involved in casesACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25
171
like this, I asked if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem and be tried there.
21 Paul refused and demanded a
hearing before His Majesty in our
highest court. So I ordered him returned
to custody un l I could send him to
Caesar in Rome."
22 Agrippa said, "I'd like to see this man
and hear his story." "Good," said Festus.
"We'll bring him in ﬁrst thing in the
morning and you'll hear it for yourself."
23 The next day everybody who was
anybody in Caesarea found his way
to the Great Hall, along with the top
military brass. Agrippa and Bernice made
a ﬂourishing grand entrance and took
their places. Festus then ordered Paul
brought in.
24 Festus said, "King Agrippa and
dis nguished guests, take a good look
at this man. A bunch of Jews pe oned
me ﬁrst in Jerusalem, and later here, toACTS OF THE APOSTLES 25 – 26 172
do away with him. They have been most
vehement in demanding his execu on.
25 I looked into it and decided that he
had commi ed no crime. He requested a
trial before Caesar and I agreed to send
him to Rome.
26 But what am I going to write to my
master, Caesar? All the charges made
by the Jews were fabrica ons, and I've
uncovered nothing else. "That's why I've
brought him before this company, and
especially you, King Agrippa: so we can
come up with something in the nature
of a charge that will hold water.
27 For it seems to me silly to send a
prisoner all that way for a trial and
not be able to document what he did
wrong."
1 Agrippa spoke directly to
Paul: "Go ahead--tell us about
yourself." Paul took the stand and told
his story.
26ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
173
2 "I can't think of anyone, King Agrippa,
before whom I'd rather be answering all
these Jewish accusa ons than you,
3 knowing how well you are acquainted
with Jewish ways and all our family
quarrels.
4 "From the me of my youth, my life
has been lived among my own people in
Jerusalem.
5 Prac cally every Jew in town who
watched me grow up--and if they were
willing to s ck their necks out they'd
tell you in person--knows that I lived as
a strict Pharisee, the most demanding
branch of our religion.
6 It's because I believed it and took it
seriously,
7 commi ed myself heart and soul to
what God promised my ancestors--the
iden cal hope, mind you, that the twelve
tribes have lived for night and day all
these centuries--it's because I have heldACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
174
on to this tested and tried hope that I'm
being called on the carpet by the Jews.
They should be the ones standing trial
here, not me!
8 For the life of me, I can't see why it's
a criminal oﬀense to believe that God
raises the dead.
9 "I admit that I didn't always hold to
this posi on. For a me I thought it was
my duty to oppose this Jesus of Nazareth
with all my might.
10 Backed with the full authority of the
high priests, I threw these believers--I
had no idea they were God's people!--
into the Jerusalem jail right and le , and
whenever it came to a vote, I voted for
their execu on.
11 I stormed through their mee ng
places, bullying them into cursing
Jesus, a one-man terror obsessed with
oblitera ng these people. And then I
started on the towns outside Jerusalem.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
175
12 "One day on my way to Damascus,
armed as always with papers from the
high priests authorizing my ac on,
13 right in the middle of the day a
blaze of light, light outshining the sun,
poured out of the sky on me and my
companions. Oh, King, it was so bright!
14 We fell ﬂat on our faces. Then I heard
a voice in Hebrew: 'Saul, Saul, why are
you out to get me? Why do you insist on
going against the grain?'
15 "I said, 'Who are you, Master?' "The
voice answered, 'I am Jesus, the One
you're hun ng down like an animal.
16 But now, up on your feet--I have a
job for you. I've handpicked you to be a
servant and witness to what's happened
today, and to what I am going to show
you.
17 "'I'm sending you oﬀ
18 to open the eyes of the outsiders
so they can see the diﬀerence betweenACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
176
dark and light, and choose light, see
the diﬀerence between Satan and God,
and choose God. I'm sending you oﬀ to
present my oﬀer of sins forgiven, and a
place in the family, invi ng them into the
company of those who begin real living
by believing in me.'
19 "What could I do, King Agrippa? I
couldn't just walk away from a vision like
that! I became an obedient believer on
the spot.
20 I started preaching this life-change--
this radical turn to God and everything
it meant in everyday life--right there in
Damascus, went on to Jerusalem and
the surrounding countryside, and from
there to the whole world.
21 "It's because of this 'whole world'
dimension that the Jews grabbed me in
the Temple that day and tried to kill me.
They want to keep God for themselves.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
177
22 But God has stood by me, just as
he promised, and I'm standing here
saying what I've been saying to anyone,
whether king or child, who will listen.
And everything I'm saying is completely
in line with what the prophets and
Moses said would happen:
23 One, the Messiah must die; two,
raised from the dead, he would be the
ﬁrst rays of God's daylight shining on
people far and near, people both godless
and God-fearing."
24 That was too much for Festus. He
interrupted with a shout: "Paul, you're
crazy! You've read too many books,
spent too much me staring oﬀ into
space! Get a grip on yourself, get back in
the real world!"
25 But Paul stood his ground. "With
all respect, Festus, Your Honor, I'm not
crazy. I'm both accurate and sane in
what I'm saying.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26
178
26 The King knows what I'm talking
about. I'm sure that nothing of what I've
said sounds crazy to him. He's known all
about it for a long me. You must realize
that this wasn't done behind the scenes.
27 You believe the prophets, don't you,
King Agrippa? Don't answer that--I know
you believe."
28 But Agrippa did answer: "Keep
this up much longer and you'll make a
Chris an out of me!"
29 Paul, s ll in chains, said, "That's what
I'm praying for, whether now or later,
and not only you but everyone listening
today, to become like me--except, of
course, for this prison jewelry!"
30 The king and the governor, along
with Bernice and their advisors, got up
31 and went into the next room to talk
over what they had heard. They quickly
agreed on Paul's innocence, saying,ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 26 – 27 179
"There's nothing in this man deserving
prison, let alone death."
32 Agrippa told Festus, "He could be set
free right now if he hadn't requested the
hearing before Caesar."
1 As soon as arrangements were
complete for our sailing to Italy,
Paul and a few other prisoners were
placed under the supervision of a
centurion named Julius, a member of an
elite guard.
2 We boarded a ship from Adramy um
that was bound for Ephesus and ports
west. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from
Thessalonica, went with us.
3 The next day we put in at Sidon. Julius
treated Paul most decently--let him get
oﬀ the ship and enjoy the hospitality of
his friends there.
4 Out to sea again, we sailed north
under the protec on of the northeast
27ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
180
shore of Cyprus because winds out of
the west were against us,
5 and then along the coast westward to
the port of Myra.
6 There the centurion found an Egyp an
ship headed for Italy and transferred us
on board.
7 We ran into bad weather and found
it impossible to stay on course. A er
much diﬃculty, we ﬁnally made it to the
southern coast of the island of Crete
8 and docked at Good Harbor
(appropriate name!).
9 By this me we had lost a lot of me.
We had passed the autumn equinox, so
it would be stormy weather from now
on through the winter, too dangerous
for sailing. Paul warned,
10 "I see only disaster ahead for cargo
and ship--to say nothing of our lives!--if
we put out to sea now."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
181
11 The centurion set Paul's warning
aside and let the ship captain and the
shipowner talk him into trying for the
next harbor.
12 But it was not the best harbor for
staying the winter. Phoenix, a few miles
further on, was more suitable.
13 When a gentle southerly breeze
came up, they weighed anchor, thinking
it would be smooth sailing.
14 But they were no sooner out to sea
than a gale-force wind, the infamous
nor'easter, struck.
15 They lost all control of the ship. It
was a cork in the storm.
16 We came under the lee of the small
island named Clauda, and managed to
get a lifeboat ready and reef the sails.
17 But rocky shoals prevented us from
ge ng close. We only managed to avoid
them by throwing out dri anchors.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
182
18 Next day, out on the high seas again
and badly damaged now by the storm,
we dumped the cargo overboard.
19 The third day the sailors lightened
the ship further by throwing oﬀ all the
tackle and provisions.
20 It had been many days since we had
seen either sun or stars. Wind and waves
were ba ering us unmercifully, and we
lost all hope of rescue.
21 With our appe te for both food and
life long gone, Paul took his place in
our midst and said, "Friends, you really
should have listened to me back in Crete.
We could have avoided all this trouble
and trial.
22 But there's no need to dwell on that
now. From now on, things are looking
up! I can assure you that there'll not be
a single drowning among us, although I
can't say as much for the ship--the ship
itself is doomed.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
183
23 "Last night God's angel stood at my
side, an angel of this God I serve,
24 saying to me, 'Don't give up, Paul.
You're going to stand before Caesar
yet--and everyone sailing with you is also
going to make it.'
25 So, dear friends, take heart. I believe
God will do exactly what he told me.
26 But we're going to shipwreck on
some island or other."
27 On the fourteenth night, adri
somewhere on the Adria c Sea, at about
midnight the sailors sensed that we were
approaching land.
28 Sounding, they measured a depth of
one hundred twenty feet, and shortly
a er that ninety feet.
29 Afraid that we were about to run
aground, they threw out four anchors
and prayed for daylight.
30 Some of the sailors tried to jump ship.
They let down the lifeboat, pretendingACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
184
they were going to set out more anchors
from the bow.
31 Paul saw through their guise and told
the centurion and his soldiers, "If these
sailors don't stay with the ship, we're all
going down."
32 So the soldiers cut the lines to the
lifeboat and let it dri oﬀ.
33 With dawn about to break, Paul
called everyone together and proposed
breakfast: "This is the fourteenth day
we've gone without food. None of us has
felt like ea ng!
34 But I urge you to eat something
now. You'll need strength for the rescue
ahead. You're going to come out of this
without even a scratch!"
35 He broke the bread, gave thanks to
God, passed it around,
36 and they all ate hear ly--
37 two hundred seventy-six of us, all
told!ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 27
185
38 With the meal ﬁnished and everyone
full, the ship was further lightened by
dumping the grain overboard.
39 At daybreak, no one recognized the
land--but then they did no ce a bay with
a nice beach. They decided to try to run
the ship up on the beach.
40 They cut the anchors, loosed the
ller, raised the sail, and ran before the
wind toward the beach.
41 But we didn't make it. S ll far from
shore, we hit a reef and the ship began
to break up.
42 The soldiers decided to kill the
prisoners so none could escape by
swimming,
43 but the centurion, determined to
save Paul, stopped them. He gave orders
for anyone who could swim to dive in
and go for it,
44 and for the rest to grab a plank.
Everyone made it to shore safely.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28

1 Once everyone was accounted
for and we realized we had all
made it, we learned that we were on the
island of Malta.
2 The na ves went out of their way to
be friendly to us. The day was rainy and
cold and we were already soaked to the
bone, but they built a huge bonﬁre and
gathered us around it.
3 Paul pitched in and helped. He had
gathered up a bundle of s cks, but when
he put it on the ﬁre, a venomous snake,
roused from its torpor by the heat,
struck his hand and held on.
4 Seeing the snake hanging from Paul's
hand like that, the na ves jumped to
the conclusion that he was a murderer
ge ng his just deserts.
5 Paul shook the snake oﬀ into the ﬁre,
none the worse for wear.
6 They kept expec ng him to drop dead,
but when it was obvious he wasn't goingACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
187
to, they jumped to the conclusion that
he was a god!
7 The head man in that part of the
island was Publius. He took us into his
home as his guests, drying us out and
pu ng us up in ﬁne style for the next
three days.
8 Publius's father was sick at the me,
down with a high fever and dysentery.
Paul went to the old man's room, and
when he laid hands on him and prayed,
the man was healed.
9 Word of the healing got around fast,
and soon everyone on the island who
was sick came and got healed.
10 We spent a wonderful three months
on Malta. They treated us royally, took
care of all our needs and ou i ed us for
the rest of the journey.
11 When an Egyp an ship that had
wintered there in the harbor prepared to
leave for Italy, we got on board. The shipACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
188
had a carved Gemini for its ﬁgurehead:
"the Heavenly Twins."
12 We put in at Syracuse for three days
13 and then went up the coast to
Rhegium. Two days later, with the wind
out of the south, we sailed into the Bay
of Naples.
14 We found Chris an friends there and
stayed with them for a week. And then
we came to Rome.
15 Friends in Rome heard we were
on the way and came out to meet
us. One group got as far as Appian
Court; another group met us at Three
Taverns--emo on-packed mee ngs, as
you can well imagine. Paul, brimming
over with praise, led us in prayers of
thanksgiving.
16 When we actually entered Rome,
they let Paul live in his own private
quarters with a soldier who had been
assigned to guard him.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
189
17 Three days later, Paul called the
Jewish leaders together for a mee ng
at his house. He said, "The Jews in
Jerusalem arrested me on trumped-up
charges, and I was taken into custody
by the Romans. I assure you that I did
absolutely nothing against Jewish laws
or Jewish customs.
18 A er the Romans inves gated the
charges and found there was nothing to
them, they wanted to set me free,
19 but the Jews objected so ﬁercely that
I was forced to appeal to Caesar. I did this
not to accuse them of any wrongdoing or
to get our people in trouble with Rome.
We've had enough trouble through the
years that way.
20 I did it for Israel. I asked you to come
and listen to me today to make it clear
that I'm on Israel's side, not against her.
I'm a hostage here for hope, not doom."ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
190
21 They said, "Nobody wrote warning
us about you. And no one has shown up
saying anything bad about you.
22 But we would like very much to hear
more. The only thing we know about
this Chris an sect is that nobody seems
to have anything good to say about it."
23 They agreed on a me. When the day
arrived, they came back to his home with
a number of their friends. Paul talked to
them all day, from morning to evening,
explaining everything involved in the
kingdom of God, and trying to persuade
them all about Jesus by poin ng out
what Moses and the prophets had
wri en about him.
24 Some of them were persuaded by
what he said, but others refused to
believe a word of it.
25 When the unbelievers got
cantankerous and started bickering
with each other, Paul interrupted: "IACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
191
have just one more thing to say to you.
The Holy Spirit sure knew what he was
talking about when he addressed our
ancestors through Isaiah the prophet:
26 Go to this people and tell them this:
"You're going to listen with your ears,
but you won't hear a word; You're going
to stare with your eyes, but you won't
see a thing.
27 These people are blockheads! They
s ck their ﬁngers in their ears so they
won't have to listen; They screw their
eyes shut so they won't have to look,
so they won't have to deal with me
face-to-face and let me heal them."
28 "You've had your chance. The
non-Jewish outsiders are next on the list.
And believe me, they're going to receive
it with open arms!"
30 Paul lived for two years in his rented
house. He welcomed everyone who
came to visit.ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 28
31 He urgently presented all ma

ers
of the kingdom of God. He explained
everything about Jesus Christ. His door
was always open.Romans

1 I, Paul, am a devoted slave of Jesus
Christ on assignment, authorized
as an apostle to proclaim God's words
and acts. I write this le er to all the
Chris ans in Rome, God's friends.
2 The sacred wri ngs contain
preliminary reports by the prophets
3 on God's Son. His descent from David
roots him in history;
4 his unique iden ty as Son of God was
shown by the Spirit when Jesus was
raised from the dead, se ng him apart
as the Messiah, our Master.
5 Through him we received both the
generous gi of his life and the urgent
task of passing it on to others who
receive it by entering into obedient trust
in Jesus.ROMANS 1
2
6 You are who you are through this gi
and call of Jesus Christ!
7 And I greet you now with all the
generosity of God our Father and our
Master Jesus, the Messiah.
8 I thank God through Jesus for
every one of you. That's ﬁrst. People
everywhere keep telling me about your
lives of faith, and every me I hear them,
I thank him.
9 And God, whom I so love to worship
and serve by spreading the good news
of his Son--the Message!--knows that
every me I think of you
10 in my prayers, which is prac cally all
the me, I ask him to clear the way for
me to come and see you.
11 The longer this wai ng goes on, the
deeper the ache. I so want to be there
to deliver God's gi in person and watch
you grow stronger right before my eyes!ROMANS 1
12 But don't think I'm not expec
3
ng to
get something out of this, too! You have
as much to give me as I do to you.
13 Please don't misinterpret my failure
to visit you, friends. You have no idea
how many mes I've made plans for
Rome. I've been determined to get some
personal enjoyment out of God's work
among you, as I have in so many other
non-Jewish towns and communi es.
But something has always come up and
prevented it.
14 Everyone I meet--it ma ers li le
whether they're mannered or rude,
smart or simple--deepens my sense of
interdependence and obliga on.
15 And that's why I can't wait to get to
you in Rome, preaching this wonderful
good news of God.
16 It's news I'm most proud to proclaim,
this extraordinary Message of God's
powerful plan to rescue everyone whoROMANS 1
4
trusts him, star ng with Jews and then
right on to everyone else!
17 God's way of pu ng people right
shows up in the acts of faith, conﬁrming
what Scripture has said all along: "The
person in right standing before God by
trus ng him really lives."
18 But God's angry displeasure erupts as
acts of human mistrust and wrongdoing
and lying accumulate, as people try to
put a shroud over truth.
19 But the basic reality of God is plain
enough. Open your eyes and there it is!
20 By taking a long and though ul look
at what God has created, people have
always been able to see what their eyes
as such can't see: eternal power, for
instance, and the mystery of his divine
being. So nobody has a good excuse.
21 What happened was this: People
knew God perfectly well, but when they
didn't treat him like God, refusing toROMANS 1
5
worship him, they trivialized themselves
into silliness and confusion so that there
was neither sense nor direc on le in
their lives.
22 They pretended to know it all, but
were illiterate regarding life.
23 They traded the glory of God who
holds the whole world in his hands
for cheap ﬁgurines you can buy at any
roadside stand.
24 So God said, in eﬀect, "If that's what
you want, that's what you get." It wasn't
long before they were living in a pigpen,
smeared with ﬁlth, ﬁlthy inside and out.
25 And all this because they traded the
true God for a fake god, and worshiped
the god they made instead of the God
who made them--the God we bless, the
God who blesses us. Oh, yes!
26 Worse followed. Refusing to know
God, they soon didn't know how to be
human either--women didn't know howROMANS 1
6
to be women, men didn't know how to
be men.
27 Sexually confused, they abused
and deﬁled one another, women with
women, men with men--all lust, no love.
And then they paid for it, oh, how they
paid for it--emp ed of God and love,
godless and loveless wretches.
28 Since they didn't bother to
acknowledge God, God quit bothering
them and let them run loose.
29 And then all hell broke loose:
rampant evil, grabbing and grasping,
vicious backstabbing. They made life hell
on earth with their envy, wanton killing,
bickering, and chea ng. Look at them:
mean-spirited, venomous,
30 fork-tongued God-bashers. Bullies,
swaggerers, insuﬀerable windbags! They
keep inven ng new ways of wrecking
lives. They ditch their parents when they
get in the way.ROMANS 1 – 2
7
31 Stupid, slimy, cruel, cold-blooded.
32 And it's not as if they don't know
be er. They know perfectly well they're
spi ng in God's face. And they don't
care--worse, they hand out prizes to
those who do the worst things best!
1 Those people are on a dark spiral
downward. But if you think that
leaves you on the high ground where
you can point your ﬁnger at others,
think again. Every me you cri cize
someone, you condemn yourself. It
takes one to know one. Judgmental
cri cism of others is a well-known way
of escaping detec on in your own crimes
and misdemeanors.
2 But God isn't so easily diverted.
He sees right through all such smoke
screens and holds you to what you've
done.
3 You didn't think, did you, that just
by poin ng your ﬁnger at others you
2ROMANS 2
8
would distract God from seeing all your
misdoings and from coming down on
you hard?
4 Or did you think that because he's
such a nice God, he'd let you oﬀ the
hook? Be er think this one through
from the beginning. God is kind, but he's
not so . In kindness he takes us ﬁrmly
by the hand and leads us into a radical
life-change.
5 You're not ge ng by with anything.
Every refusal and avoidance of God adds
fuel to the ﬁre. The day is coming when
it's going to blaze hot and high, God's
ﬁery and righteous judgment.
6 Make no mistake: In the end you get
what's coming to you--
7 Real Life for those who work on God's
side,
8 but to those who insist on ge ng
their own way and take the path of least
resistance, Fire!ROMANS 2
9
9 If you go against the grain, you
get splinters, regardless of which
neighborhood you're from, what your
parents taught you, what schools you
a ended.
10 But if you embrace the way God does
things, there are wonderful payoﬀs,
again without regard to where you are
from or how you were brought up.
11 Being a Jew won't give you an
automa c stamp of approval. God pays
no a en on to what others say (or what
you think) about you. He makes up his
own mind.
12 If you sin without knowing what
you're doing, God takes that into
account. But if you sin knowing full well
what you're doing, that's a diﬀerent
story en rely.
13 Merely hearing God's law is a waste
of your me if you don't do what heROMANS 2
10
commands. Doing, not hearing, is what
makes the diﬀerence with God.
14 When outsiders who have never
heard of God's law follow it more or less
by ins nct, they conﬁrm its truth by their
obedience.
15 They show that God's law is not
something alien, imposed on us from
without, but woven into the very fabric
of our crea on. There is something deep
within them that echoes God's yes and
no, right and wrong.
16 Their response to God's yes and no
will become public knowledge on the
day God makes his ﬁnal decision about
every man and woman. The Message
from God that I proclaim through Jesus
Christ takes into account all these
diﬀerences.
17 If you're brought up Jewish, don't
assume that you can lean back in the
arms of your religion and take it easy,ROMANS 2
11
feeling smug because you're an insider
to God's revela on,
18 a connoisseur of the best things of
God, informed on the latest doctrines!
19 I have a special word of cau on for
you who are sure that you have it all
together yourselves and, because you
know God's revealed Word inside and
out,
20 feel qualiﬁed to guide others through
their blind alleys and dark nights and
confused emo ons to God.
21 While you are guiding others, who is
going to guide you? I'm quite serious.
While preaching "Don't steal!" are you
going to rob people blind? Who would
suspect you?
22 The same with adultery. The same
with idolatry.
23 You can get by with almost anything
if you front it with eloquent talk about
God and his law.ROMANS 2
12
24 The line from Scripture, "It's because
of you Jews that the outsiders are down
on God," shows it's an old problem that
isn't going to go away.
25 Circumcision, the surgical ritual that
marks you as a Jew, is great if you live in
accord with God's law. But if you don't,
it's worse than not being circumcised.
26 The reverse is also true: The
uncircumcised who keep God's ways are
as good as the circumcised--
27 in fact, be er. Be er to keep
God's law uncircumcised than break it
circumcised.
28 Don't you see: It's not the cut of a
knife that makes a Jew.
29 You become a Jew by who you are.
It's the mark of God on your heart, not
of a knife on your skin, that makes a Jew.
And recogni on comes from God, not
legalis c cri cs.ROMANS 3
3
13
1 So what diﬀerence does it make
who's a Jew and who isn't, who has
been trained in God's ways and who
hasn't?
2 As it turns out, it makes a lot of
diﬀerence--but not the diﬀerence so
many have assumed. First, there's the
ma er of being put in charge of wri ng
down and caring for God's revela on,
these Holy Scriptures.
3 So, what if, in the course of doing that,
some of those Jews abandoned their
post? God didn't abandon them. Do you
think their faithlessness cancels out his
faithfulness?
4 Not on your life! Depend on it: God
keeps his word even when the whole
world is lying through its teeth. Scripture
says the same: Your words stand fast and
true; Rejec on doesn't faze you.
5 But if our wrongdoing only underlines
and conﬁrms God's rightdoing, shouldn'tROMANS 3
14
we be commended for helping out?
Since our bad words don't even make a
dent in his good words, isn't it wrong of
God to back us to the wall and hold us to
our word? These ques ons come up.
6 The answer to such ques ons is no,
a most empha c No! How else would
things ever get straightened out if God
didn't do the straightening?
7 It's simply perverse to say, "If my lies
serve to show oﬀ God's truth all the
more gloriously, why blame me? I'm
doing God a favor."
8 Some people are actually trying to put
such words in our mouths, claiming that
we go around saying, "The more evil we
do, the more good God does, so let's
just do it!" That's pure slander, as I'm
sure you'll agree. We're All in the Same
Sinking Boat
9 So where does that put us? Do
we Jews get a be er break than theROMANS 3
15
others? Not really. Basically, all of us,
whether insiders or outsiders, start out
in iden cal condi ons, which is to say
that we all start out as sinners. Scripture
leaves no doubt about it:
10 There's nobody living right, not even
one,
11 nobody who knows the score,
nobody alert for God.
12 They've all taken the wrong turn;
they've all wandered down blind alleys.
No one's living right; I can't ﬁnd a single
one.
13 Their throats are gaping graves, their
tongues slick as mud slides. Every word
they speak is nged with poison.
14 They open their mouths and pollute
the air.
15 They race for the honor of sinner-of-
the-year,
16 li er the land with heartbreak and
ruin,ROMANS 3
16
17 Don't know the ﬁrst thing about
living with others.
18 They never give God the me of day.
19 This makes it clear, doesn't it, that
whatever is wri en in these Scriptures
is not what God says about others but
to us to whom these Scriptures were
addressed in the ﬁrst place! And it's
clear enough, isn't it, that we're sinners,
every one of us, in the same sinking boat
with everybody else?
20 Our involvement with God's
revela on doesn't put us right with God.
What it does is force us to face our
complicity in everyone else's sin.
21 But in our me something new
has been added. What Moses and the
prophets witnessed to all those years
has happened.
22 The God-se ng-things-right that we
read about has become Jesus-se ng-
things-right for us. And not only for us,ROMANS 3
17
but for everyone who believes in him.
For there is no diﬀerence between us
and them in this.
23 Since we've compiled this long and
sorry record as sinners (both us and
them) and proved that we are u erly
incapable of living the glorious lives God
wills for us,
24 God did it for us. Out of sheer
generosity he put us in right standing
with himself. A pure gi . He got us out
of the mess we're in and restored us to
where he always wanted us to be. And
he did it by means of Jesus Christ.
25 God sacriﬁced Jesus on the altar of
the world to clear that world of sin.
Having faith in him sets us in the clear.
God decided on this course of ac on in
full view of the public--to set the world
in the clear with himself through the
sacriﬁce of Jesus, ﬁnally taking care of
the sins he had so pa ently endured.ROMANS 3
18
26 This is not only clear, but it's now--
this is current history! God sets things
right. He also makes it possible for us to
live in his rightness.
27 So where does that leave our proud
Jewish insider claims and counterclaims?
Canceled? Yes, canceled. What we've
learned is this: God does not respond to
what we do; we respond to what God
does.
28 We've ﬁnally ﬁgured it out. Our lives
get in step with God and all others by
le ng him set the pace, not by proudly
or anxiously trying to run the parade.
29 And where does that leave our proud
Jewish claim of having a corner on God?
Also canceled. God is the God of outsider
non-Jews as well as insider Jews.
30 How could it be otherwise since
there is only one God? God sets right all
who welcome his ac on and enter into
it, both those who follow our religiousROMANS 3 – 4
19
system and those who have never heard
of our religion.
31 But by shi ing our focus from what
we do to what God does, don't we cancel
out all our careful keeping of the rules
and ways God commanded? Not at all.
What happens, in fact, is that by pu ng
that en re way of life in its proper place,
we conﬁrm it.
1 So how do we ﬁt what we know of
Abraham, our ﬁrst father in the faith,
into this new way of looking at things?
2 If Abraham, by what he did for God,
got God to approve him, he could
certainly have taken credit for it. But the
story we're given is a God-story, not an
Abraham-story.
3 What we read in Scripture is,
"Abraham entered into what God was
doing for him, and that was the turning
point. He trusted God to set him right
instead of trying to be right on his own."
4ROMANS 4
20
4 If you're a hard worker and do a good
job, you deserve your pay; we don't call
your wages a gi .
5 But if you see that the job is too big
for you, that it's something only God can
do, and you trust him to do it--you could
never do it for yourself no ma er how
hard and long you worked--well, that
trus ng-him-to-do-it is what gets you
set right with God, by God. Sheer gi .
6 David conﬁrms this way of looking at
it, saying that the one who trusts God to
do the pu ng-everything-right without
insis ng on having a say in it is one
fortunate man:
7 Fortunate those whose crimes are
carted oﬀ, whose sins are wiped clean
from the slate.
8 Fortunate the person against whom
the Lord does not keep score.
9 Do you think for a minute that this
blessing is only pronounced over thoseROMANS 4
21
of us who keep our religious ways and
are circumcised? Or do you think it
possible that the blessing could be given
to those who never even heard of our
ways, who were never brought up in the
disciplines of God? We all agree, don't
we, that it was by embracing what God
did for him that Abraham was declared
ﬁt before God?
10 Now [think]: Was that declara on
made before or a er he was marked by
the covenant rite of circumcision? That's
right, [before] he was marked.
11 That means that he underwent
circumcision as evidence and
conﬁrma on of what God had
done long before to bring him into this
acceptable standing with himself, an act
of God he had embraced with his whole
life.
12 And it means further that Abraham
is father of [all] people who embraceROMANS 4
22
what God does for them while they
are s ll on the "outs" with God,
as yet uniden ﬁed as God's, in an
"uncircumcised" condi on. It is precisely
these people in this condi on who are
called "set right by God and with God"!
Abraham is also, of course, father of
those who have undergone the religious
rite of circumcision [not] just because of
the ritual but because they were willing
to live in the risky faith-embrace of
God's ac on for them, the way Abraham
lived long before he was marked by
circumcision.
13 That famous promise God gave
Abraham--that he and his children
would possess the earth--was not given
because of something Abraham did
or would do. It was based on God's
decision to put everything together for
him, which Abraham then entered when
he believed.ROMANS 4
23
14 If those who get what God gives
them only get it by doing everything
they are told to do and ﬁlling out all
the right forms properly signed, that
eliminates personal trust completely
and turns the promise into an ironclad
[contract]! That's not a holy promise;
that's a business deal.
15 A contract drawn up by a hard-nosed
lawyer and with plenty of ﬁne print only
makes sure that you will never be able to
collect. But if there is no contract in the
ﬁrst place, simply a [promise]--and God's
promise at that--you can't break it.
16 This is why the fulﬁllment of God's
promise depends en rely on trus ng
God and his way, and then simply
embracing him and what he does. God's
promise arrives as pure gi . That's the
only way everyone can be sure to get
in on it, those who keep the religious
tradi ons [and] those who have neverROMANS 4
24
heard of them. For Abraham is father of
us all. He is not our racial father--that's
reading the story backwards. He is our
[faith] father.
17 We call Abraham "father" not
because he got God's a en on by living
like a saint, but because God made
something out of Abraham when he
was a nobody. Isn't that what we've
always read in Scripture, God saying to
Abraham, "I set you up as father of many
peoples"? Abraham was ﬁrst named
"father" and then [became] a father
because he dared to trust God to do
what only God could do: raise the dead
to life, with a word make something out
of nothing.
18 When everything was hopeless,
Abraham believed anyway, deciding to
live not on the basis of what he saw he
[couldn't] do but on what God said he
[would] do. And so he was made fatherROMANS 4
25
of a mul tude of peoples. God himself
said to him, "You're going to have a big
family, Abraham!"
19 Abraham didn't focus on his own
impotence and say, "It's hopeless. This
hundred-year-old body could never
father a child." Nor did he survey Sarah's
decades of infer lity and give up.
20 He didn't ptoe around God's
promise asking cau ously skep cal
ques ons. He plunged into the promise
and came up strong, ready for God,
21 sure that God would make good on
what he had said.
22 That's why it is said, "Abraham was
declared ﬁt before God by trus ng God
to set him right."
23 But it's not just Abraham;
24 it's also us! The same thing gets said
about us when we embrace and believe
the One who brought Jesus to life when
the condi ons were equally hopeless.ROMANS 4 – 5
26
25 The sacriﬁced Jesus made us ﬁt for
God, set us [right with God].
1 By entering through faith into what
God has always wanted to do for
us--set us right with him, make us ﬁt for
him--we have it all together with God
because of our Master Jesus.
2 And that's not all: We throw open our
doors to God and discover at the same
moment that he has already thrown
open his door to us. We ﬁnd ourselves
standing where we always hoped we
might stand--out in the wide open
spaces of God's grace and glory, standing
tall and shou ng our praise.
3 There's more to come: We con nue
to shout our praise even when we're
hemmed in with troubles, because
we know how troubles can develop
passionate pa ence in us,
5ROMANS 5
4 and how that pa
27
ence in turn forges
the tempered steel of virtue, keeping us
alert for whatever God will do next.
5 In alert expectancy such as this, we're
never le feeling shortchanged. Quite
the contrary--we can't round up enough
containers to hold everything God
generously pours into our lives through
the Holy Spirit!
6 Christ arrives right on me to make
this happen. He didn't, and doesn't,
wait for us to get ready. He presented
himself for this sacriﬁcial death when
we were far too weak and rebellious
to do anything to get ourselves ready.
And even if we hadn't been so weak,
we wouldn't have known what to do
anyway.
7 We can understand someone dying
for a person worth dying for, and we
can understand how someone goodROMANS 5
28
and noble could inspire us to selﬂess
sacriﬁce.
8 But God put his love on the line for
us by oﬀering his Son in sacriﬁcial death
while we were of no use whatever to
him.
9 Now that we are set right with God
by means of this sacriﬁcial death, the
consummate blood sacriﬁce, there is no
longer a ques on of being at odds with
God in any way.
10 If, when we were at our worst, we
were put on friendly terms with God by
the sacriﬁcial death of his Son, now that
we're at our best, just think of how our
lives will expand and deepen by means
of his resurrec on life!
11 Now that we have actually received
this amazing friendship with God, we
are no longer content to simply say it
in plodding prose. We sing and shoutROMANS 5
29
our praises to God through Jesus, the
Messiah!
12 You know the story of how Adam
landed us in the dilemma we're in--ﬁrst
sin, then death, and no one exempt from
either sin or death.
13 That sin disturbed rela ons with
God in everything and everyone, but
the extent of the disturbance was not
clear un l God spelled it out in detail
to Moses. So death, this huge abyss
separa ng us from God, dominated the
landscape from Adam to Moses.
14 Even those who didn't sin precisely
as Adam did by disobeying a speciﬁc
command of God s ll had to experience
this termina on of life, this separa on
from God. But Adam, who got us into
this, also points ahead to the One who
will get us out of it.
15 Yet the rescuing gi is not exactly
parallel to the death-dealing sin. If oneROMANS 5
30
man's sin put crowds of people at the
dead-end abyss of separa on from
God, just think what God's gi poured
through one man, Jesus Christ, will do!
16 There's no comparison between that
death-dealing sin and this generous,
life-giving gi . The verdict on that one
sin was the death sentence; the verdict
on the many sins that followed was this
wonderful life sentence.
17 If death got the upper hand through
one man's wrongdoing, can you imagine
the breathtaking recovery life makes,
sovereign life, in those who grasp with
both hands this wildly extravagant life-
gi , this grand se ng-everything-right,
that the one man Jesus Christ provides?
18 Here it is in a nutshell: Just as one
person did it wrong and got us in all
this trouble with sin and death, another
person did it right and got us out of it.ROMANS 5 – 6
31
But more than just ge ng us out of
trouble, he got us into life!
19 One man said no to God and put
many people in the wrong; one man said
yes to God and put many in the right.
20 All that passing laws against sin did
was produce more lawbreakers. But
sin didn't, and doesn't, have a chance
in compe on with the aggressive
forgiveness we call [grace]. When it's sin
versus grace, grace wins hands down.
21 All sin can do is threaten us with
death, and that's the end of it. Grace,
because God is pu ng everything
together again through the Messiah,
invites us into life--a life that goes on and
on and on, world without end.
1 So what do we do? Keep on sinning
so God can keep on forgiving?
2 I should hope not! If we've le the
country where sin is sovereign, how can
we s ll live in our old house there?
6ROMANS 6
32
3 Or didn't you realize we packed up
and le there for good? That is what
happened in bap sm. When we went
under the water, we le the old country
of sin behind; when we came up out
of the water, we entered into the new
country of grace--a new life in a new
land! That's what bap sm into the life of
Jesus means.
4 When we are lowered into the water,
it is like the burial of Jesus; when we are
raised up out of the water, it is like the
resurrec on of Jesus.
5 Each of us is raised into a light-ﬁlled
world by our Father so that we can
see where we're going in our new
grace-sovereign country.
6 Could it be any clearer? Our old way of
life was nailed to the Cross with Christ,
a decisive end to that sin-miserable
life--no longer at sin's every beck and
call! What we believe is this:ROMANS 6
33
8 If we get included in Christ's sin-
conquering death, we also get included
in his life-saving resurrec on.
9 We know that when Jesus was raised
from the dead it was a signal of the end
of death-as-the-end. Never again will
death have the last word.
10 When Jesus died, he took sin down
with him, but alive he brings God down
to us.
11 From now on, think of it this way:
Sin speaks a dead language that means
nothing to you; God speaks your mother
tongue, and you hang on every word.
You are dead to sin and alive to God.
That's what Jesus did.
12 That means you must not give sin a
vote in the way you conduct your lives.
Don't give it the me of day.
13 Don't even run li le errands that
are connected with that old way of life.
Throw yourselves wholeheartedly andROMANS 6
34
full- me--remember, you've been raised
from the dead!--into God's way of doing
things.
14 Sin can't tell you how to live. A er all,
you're not living under that old tyranny
any longer. You're living in the freedom
of God.
15 So, since we're out from under the
old tyranny, does that mean we can live
any old way we want? Since we're free in
the freedom of God, can we do anything
that comes to mind?
16 Hardly. You know well enough from
your own experience that there are
some acts of so-called freedom that
destroy freedom. Oﬀer yourselves to sin,
for instance, and it's your last free act.
But oﬀer yourselves to the ways of God
and the freedom never quits. All your
lives you've let sin tell you what to do.
17 But thank God you've started
listening to a new master,ROMANS 6
35
18 one whose commands set you free
to live openly in [his] freedom!
19 I'm using this freedom language
because it's easy to picture. You can
readily recall, can't you, how at one
me the more you did just what you felt
like doing--not caring about others, not
caring about God--the worse your life
became and the less freedom you had?
And how much diﬀerent is it now as you
live in God's freedom, your lives healed
and expansive in holiness?
20 As long as you did what you felt like
doing, ignoring God, you didn't have to
bother with right thinking or right living,
or right [anything] for that ma er.
21 But do you call that a free life? What
did you get out of it? Nothing you're
proud of now. Where did it get you? A
dead end.
22 But now that you've found you don't
have to listen to sin tell you what toROMANS 6 – 7
36
do, and have discovered the delight
of listening to God telling you, what a
surprise! A whole, healed, put-together
life right now, with more and more of life
on the way!
23 Work hard for sin your whole life and
your pension is death. But God's gi is
[real life], eternal life, delivered by Jesus,
our Master.
1 You shouldn't have any trouble
understanding this, friends, for you
know all the ins and outs of the law--how
it works and how its power touches only
the living.
2 For instance, a wife is legally ed to
her husband while he lives, but if he
dies, she's free.
3 If she lives with another man while
her husband is living, she's obviously an
adulteress. But if he dies, she is quite
free to marry another man in good
conscience, with no one's disapproval.
7ROMANS 7
37
4 So, my friends, this is something
like what has taken place with you.
When Christ died he took that en re
rule-dominated way of life down with
him and le it in the tomb, leaving you
free to "marry" a resurrec on life and
bear "oﬀspring" of faith for God.
5 For as long as we lived that old way of
life, doing whatever we felt we could get
away with, sin was calling most of the
shots as the old law code hemmed us in.
And this made us all the more rebellious.
In the end, all we had to show for it was
miscarriages and s llbirths.
6 But now that we're no longer shackled
to that domineering mate of sin, and
out from under all those oppressive
regula ons and ﬁne print, we're free to
live a new life in the freedom of God.
7 But I can hear you say, "If the law
code was as bad as all that, it's no be er
than sin itself." That's certainly not true.ROMANS 7
38
The law code had a perfectly legi mate
func on. Without its clear guidelines
for right and wrong, moral behavior
would be mostly guesswork. Apart from
the succinct, surgical command, "You
shall not covet," I could have dressed
covetousness up to look like a virtue and
ruined my life with it.
8 Don't you remember how it was? I
do, perfectly well. The law code started
out as an excellent piece of work.
What happened, though, was that sin
found a way to pervert the command
into a tempta on, making a piece of
"forbidden fruit" out of it. The law code,
instead of being used to guide me,
was used to seduce me. Without all
the paraphernalia of the law code, sin
looked pre y dull and lifeless,
9 and I went along without paying much
a en on to it. But once sin got its handsROMANS 7
39
on the law code and decked itself out in
all that ﬁnery, I was fooled, and fell for it.
10 The very command that was
supposed to guide me into life was
cleverly used to trip me up, throwing me
headlong.
11 So sin was plenty alive, and I was
stone dead.
12 But the law code itself is God's good
and common sense, each command
sane and holy counsel.
13 I can already hear your next ques on:
"Does that mean I can't even trust what
is good [[that is, the law]]? Is good just as
dangerous as evil?" No again! Sin simply
did what sin is so famous for doing: using
the good as a cover to tempt me to do
what would ﬁnally destroy me. By hiding
within God's good commandment, sin
did far more mischief than it could ever
have accomplished on its own.ROMANS 7
14 I can an
40
cipate the response that
is coming: "I know that all God's
commands are spiritual, but I'm not.
Isn't this also your experience?" Yes. I'm
full of myself--a er all, I've spent a long
me in sin's prison.
15 What I don't understand about
myself is that I decide one way, but then
I act another, doing things I absolutely
despise.
16 So if I can't be trusted to ﬁgure out
what is best for myself and then do it, it
becomes obvious that God's command
is necessary.
17 But I need something [more]! For
if I know the law but s ll can't keep
it, and if the power of sin within me
keeps sabotaging my best inten ons, I
obviously need help!
18 I realize that I don't have what it
takes. I can will it, but I can't do it.ROMANS 7
41
19 I decide to do good, but I don't really
do it; I decide not to do bad, but then I
do it anyway.
20 My decisions, such as they are, don't
result in ac ons. Something has gone
wrong deep within me and gets the
be er of me every me.
21 It happens so regularly that it's
predictable. The moment I decide to do
good, sin is there to trip me up.
22 I truly delight in God's commands,
23 but it's pre y obvious that not all
of me joins in that delight. Parts of me
covertly rebel, and just when I least
expect it, they take charge.
24 I've tried everything and nothing
helps. I'm at the end of my rope. Is there
no one who can do anything for me?
Isn't that the real ques on?
25 The answer, thank God, is that Jesus
Christ can and does. He acted to set
things right in this life of contradic onsROMANS 8
42
where I want to serve God with all my
heart and mind, but am pulled by the
inﬂuence of sin to do something totally
diﬀerent.
1 With the arrival of Jesus, the
Messiah, that fateful dilemma is
resolved. Those who enter into Christ's
being-here-for-us no longer have to
live under a con nuous, low-lying black
cloud.
2 A new power is in opera on. The Spirit
of life in Christ, like a strong wind, has
magniﬁcently cleared the air, freeing you
from a fated life me of brutal tyranny at
the hands of sin and death.
3 God went for the jugular when he
sent his own Son. He didn't deal with
the problem as something remote
and unimportant. In his Son, Jesus,
he personally took on the human
condi on, entered the disordered mess
of struggling humanity in order to set
8ROMANS 8
43
it right once and for all. The law code,
weakened as it always was by fractured
human nature, could never have done
that. The law always ended up being
used as a Band-Aid on sin instead of a
deep healing of it.
4 And now what the law code asked for
but we couldn't deliver is accomplished
as we, instead of redoubling our own
eﬀorts, simply embrace what the Spirit
is doing in us.
5 Those who think they can do it on their
own end up obsessed with measuring
their own moral muscle but never get
around to exercising it in real life. Those
who trust God's ac on in them ﬁnd
that God's Spirit is in them--living and
breathing God!
6 Obsession with self in these ma ers
is a dead end; a en on to God leads us
out into the open, into a spacious, free
life.ROMANS 8
44
7 Focusing on the self is the opposite
of focusing on God. Anyone completely
absorbed in self ignores God, ends up
thinking more about self than God. That
person ignores who God is and what he
is doing.
8 And God isn't pleased at being
ignored.
9 But if God himself has taken up
residence in your life, you can hardly
be thinking more of yourself than of
him. Anyone, of course, who has not
welcomed this invisible but clearly
present God, the Spirit of Christ, won't
know what we're talking about.
10 But for you who welcome him, in
whom he dwells--even though you s ll
experience all the limita ons of sin--you
yourself experience life on God's terms.
11 It stands to reason, doesn't it, that
if the alive-and-present God who raised
Jesus from the dead moves into yourROMANS 8
45
life, he'll do the same thing in you that
he did in Jesus, bringing you alive to
himself? When God lives and breathes in
you (and he does, as surely as he did in
Jesus), you are delivered from that dead
life. With his Spirit living in you, your
body will be as alive as Christ's!
12 So don't you see that we don't owe
this old do-it-yourself life one red cent.
13 There's nothing in it for us, nothing
at all. The best thing to do is give it a
decent burial and get on with your new
life.
14 God's Spirit beckons. There are things
to do and places to go!
15 This resurrec on life you received
from God is not a mid, grave-tending
life. It's adventurously expectant,
gree ng God with a childlike "What's
next, Papa?"
16 God's Spirit touches our spirits and
conﬁrms who we really are. We knowROMANS 8
46
who he is, and we know who we are:
Father and children.
17 And we know we are going to get
what's coming to us--an unbelievable
inheritance! We go through exactly what
Christ goes through. If we go through
the hard mes with him, then we're
certainly going to go through the good
mes with him!
18 That's why I don't think there's any
comparison between the present hard
mes and the coming good mes.
19 The created world itself can hardly
wait for what's coming next.
20 Everything in crea on is being more
or less held back. God reins it in
21 un l both crea on and all the
creatures are ready and can be released
at the same moment into the glorious
mes ahead. Meanwhile, the joyful
an cipa on deepens.ROMANS 8
47
22 All around us we observe a pregnant
crea on. The diﬃcult mes of pain
throughout the world are simply birth
pangs. But it's not only around us; it's
[within] us. The Spirit of God is arousing
us within. We're also feeling the birth
pangs.
23 These sterile and barren bodies of
ours are yearning for full deliverance.
24 That is why wai ng does not diminish
us, any more than wai ng diminishes a
pregnant mother. We are enlarged in the
wai ng. We, of course, don't see what is
enlarging us.
25 But the longer we wait, the larger
we become, and the more joyful our
expectancy.
26 Meanwhile, the moment we get
red in the wai ng, God's Spirit is right
alongside helping us along. If we don't
know how or what to pray, it doesn't
ma er. He does our praying in and forROMANS 8
48
us, making prayer out of our wordless
sighs, our aching groans.
27 He knows us far be er than we
know ourselves, knows our pregnant
condi on, and keeps us present before
God.
28 That's why we can be so sure that
every detail in our lives of love for God is
worked into something good.
29 God knew what he was doing from
the very beginning. He decided from the
outset to shape the lives of those who
love him along the same lines as the life
of his Son. The Son stands ﬁrst in the
line of humanity he restored. We see the
original and intended shape of our lives
there in him.
30 A er God made that decision of what
his children should be like, he followed
it up by calling people by name. A er he
called them by name, he set them on a
solid basis with himself. And then, a erROMANS 8
49
ge ng them established, he stayed with
them to the end, gloriously comple ng
what he had begun.
31 So, what do you think? With God on
our side like this, how can we lose?
32 If God didn't hesitate to put
everything on the line for us, embracing
our condi on and exposing himself to
the worst by sending his own Son, is
there anything else he wouldn't gladly
and freely do for us?
33 And who would dare tangle with God
by messing with one of God's chosen?
34 Who would dare even to point a
ﬁnger? The One who died for us--who
was raised to life for us!--is in the
presence of God at this very moment
s cking up for us.
35 Do you think anyone is going to be
able to drive a wedge between us and
Christ's love for us? There is no way! Not
trouble, not hard mes, not hatred, notROMANS 8 – 9
50
hunger, not homelessness, not bullying
threats, not backstabbing, not even the
worst sins listed in Scripture:
36 They kill us in cold blood because
they hate you. We're si ng ducks; they
pick us oﬀ one by one.
37 None of this fazes us because Jesus
loves us.
38 I'm absolutely convinced that
nothing--nothing living or dead, angelic
or demonic, today or tomorrow,
39 high or low, thinkable or unthinkable-
-absolutely [nothing] can get between us
and God's love because of the way that
Jesus our Master has embraced us.
1 At the same me, you need to
know that I carry with me at all mes
a huge sorrow.
2 It's an enormous pain deep within
me, and I'm never free of it. I'm not
exaggera ng--Christ and the Holy Spirit
are my witnesses. It's the Israelites...
9ROMANS 9
51
3 If there were any way I could be
cursed by the Messiah so they could be
blessed by him, I'd do it in a minute.
They're my family.
4 I grew up with them. They had
everything going for them--family,
glory, covenants, revela on, worship,
promises,
5 to say nothing of being the race that
produced the Messiah, the Christ, who
is God over everything, always. Oh, yes!
6 Don't suppose for a moment, though,
that God's Word has malfunc oned in
some way or other. The problem goes
back a long way. From the outset, not all
Israelites of the ﬂesh were Israelites of
the spirit.
7 It wasn't Abraham's sperm that gave
iden ty here, but God's [promise].
Remember how it was put: "Your family
will be deﬁned by Isaac"?ROMANS 9
8 That means that Israelite iden
52
ty
was never racially determined by
sexual transmission, but it was [God]
-determined by promise.
9 Remember that promise, "When I
come back next year at this me, Sarah
will have a son"?
10 And that's not the only me. To
Rebecca, also, a promise was made that
took priority over gene cs. When she
became pregnant by our one-of-a-kind
ancestor, Isaac,
11 and her babies were s ll innocent
in the womb--incapable of good or
bad--she received a special assurance
from God. What God did in this case
made it perfectly plain that his purpose
is not a hit-or-miss thing dependent on
what we do or don't do, but a sure thing
determined by his decision, ﬂowing
steadily from his ini a ve.ROMANS 9
53
12 God told Rebecca, "The ﬁrstborn of
your twins will take second place."
13 Later that was turned into a stark
epigram: "I loved Jacob; I hated Esau."
14 Is that grounds for complaining that
God is unfair? Not so fast, please.
15 God told Moses, "[I'm] in charge of
mercy. [I'm] in charge of compassion."
16 Compassion doesn't originate in our
bleeding hearts or moral sweat, but in
God's mercy.
17 The same point was made when
God said to Pharaoh, "I picked you as a
bit player in this drama of my salva on
power."
18 All we're saying is that God has the
ﬁrst word, ini a ng the ac on in which
we play our part for good or ill.
19 Are you going to object, "So how can
God blame us for anything since he's in
charge of everything? If the big decisionsROMANS 9
54
are already made, what say do we have
in it?"
20 Who in the world do you think you
are to second-guess God? Do you for
one moment suppose any of us knows
enough to call God into ques on? Clay
doesn't talk back to the ﬁngers that mold
it, saying, "Why did you shape me like
this?"
21 Isn't it obvious that a po er has
a perfect right to shape one lump of
clay into a vase for holding ﬂowers and
another into a pot for cooking beans?
22 If God needs one style of po ery
especially designed to show his angry
displeasure
23 and another style carefully cra ed to
show his glorious goodness, isn't that all
right?
24 Either or both happens to Jews, but
it also happens to the other people.ROMANS 9
55
25 Hosea put it well: I'll call nobodies
and make them somebodies; I'll call the
unloved and make them beloved.
26 In the place where they yelled out,
"You're nobody!" they're calling you
"God's living children."
27 Isaiah maintained this same
emphasis: If each grain of sand on
the seashore were numbered and the
sum labeled "chosen of God," They'd
be numbers s ll, not names; salva on
comes by personal selec on.
28 God doesn't count us; he calls us by
name. Arithme c is not his focus.
29 Isaiah had looked ahead and spoken
the truth: If our powerful God had not
provided us a legacy of living children,
We would have ended up like ghost
towns, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
30 How can we sum this up? All those
people who didn't seem interested in
what God was doing actually [embraced]ROMANS 9 – 10
56
what God was doing as he straightened
out their lives.
31 And Israel, who seemed so interested
in reading and talking about what God
was doing, missed it.
32 How could they miss it? Because
instead of trus ng God, [they] took
over. They were absorbed in what they
themselves were doing. They were so
absorbed in their "God projects" that
they didn't no ce God right in front of
them, like a huge rock in the middle of
the road. And so they stumbled into him
and went sprawling.
33 Isaiah (again!) gives us the metaphor
for pulling this together: Careful! I've
put a huge stone on the road to Mount
Zion, a stone you can't get around. But
the stone is me! If you're looking for me,
you'll ﬁnd me on the way, not in the way.
1 Believe me, friends, all I want
for Israel is what's best for Israel:
10ROMANS 10
57
salva on, nothing less. I want it with all
my heart and pray to God for it all the
me.
2 I readily admit that the Jews are
impressively energe c regarding God-
-but they are doing everything exactly
backwards.
3 They don't seem to realize that this
comprehensive se ng-things-right that
is salva on is God's business, and a most
ﬂourishing business it is. Right across the
street they set up their own salva on
shops and noisily hawk their wares. A er
all these years of refusing to really deal
with God on his terms, insis ng instead
on making their own deals, they have
nothing to show for it.
4 The earlier revela on was intended
simply to get us ready for the Messiah,
who then puts everything right for those
who trust him to do it.ROMANS 10
58
5 Moses wrote that anyone who insists
on using the law code to live right
before God soon discovers it's not so
easy--every detail of life regulated by
ﬁne print!
6 But trus ng God to shape the right
living in us is a diﬀerent story--no
precarious climb up to heaven to recruit
the Messiah,
7 no dangerous descent into hell to
rescue the Messiah.
8 So what exactly was Moses saying?
The word that saves is right here, as near
as the tongue in your mouth, as close as
the heart in your chest. It's the word of
faith that welcomes God to go to work
and set things right for us. This is the
core of our preaching.
9 Say the welcoming word to God--
"Jesus is my Master"--embracing, body
and soul, God's work of doing in us what
he did in raising Jesus from the dead.ROMANS 10
59
That's it. You're not "doing" anything;
you're simply calling out to God, trus ng
him to do it for you. That's salva on.
10 With your whole being you embrace
God se ng things right, and then you
say it, right out loud: "God has set
everything right between him and me!"
11 Scripture reassures us, "No one who
trusts God like this--heart and soul--will
ever regret it."
12 It's exactly the same no ma er what
a person's religious background may
be: the same God for all of us, ac ng
the same incredibly generous way to
everyone who calls out for help.
13 "Everyone who calls, 'Help, God!'
gets help."
14 But how can people call for help
if they don't know who to trust? And
how can they know who to trust if
they haven't heard of the One who canROMANS 10
60
be trusted? And how can they hear if
nobody tells them?
15 And how is anyone going to tell them,
unless someone is sent to do it? That's
why Scripture exclaims, A sight to take
your breath away! Grand processions of
people telling all the good things of God!
16 But not everybody is ready for this,
ready to see and hear and act. Isaiah
asked what we all ask at one me or
another: "Does anyone care, God? Is
anyone listening and believing a word of
it?"
17 The point is, Before you trust, you
have to listen. But unless Christ's Word
is preached, there's nothing to listen to.
18 But haven't there been plenty of
opportuni es for Israel to listen and
understand what's going on? Plenty, I'd
say. Preachers' voices have gone 'round
the world, Their message to earth's
seven seas.ROMANS 10 – 11
19 So the big ques
61
on is, Why didn't
Israel understand that she had no corner
on this message? Moses had it right
when he predicted, When you see God
reach out to those you consider your
inferiors--outsiders!--you'll become
insanely jealous. When you see God
reach out to people you think are
religiously stupid, you'll throw temper
tantrums.
20 Isaiah dared to speak out these words
of God: People found and welcomed me
who never so much as looked for me.
And I found and welcomed people who
had never even asked about me.
21 Then he capped it with a damning
indictment: Day a er day a er day, I
beckoned Israel with open arms, And
got nothing for my trouble but cold
shoulders and icy stares.
1 Does this mean, then, that
God is so fed up with Israel that
11ROMANS 11
62
he'll have nothing more to do with
them? Hardly. Remember that I, the one
wri ng these things, am an Israelite, a
descendant of Abraham out of the tribe
of Benjamin. You can't get much more
Semi c than that!
2 So we're not talking about repudia on.
God has been too long involved with
Israel, has too much invested, to
simply wash his hands of them. Do you
remember that me Elijah was agonizing
over this same Israel and cried out in
prayer?
3 God, they murdered your prophets,
They trashed your altars; I'm the only
one le and now they're a er me!
4 And do you remember God's answer?
I s ll have seven thousand who haven't
quit, Seven thousand who are loyal to
the ﬁnish.ROMANS 11
63
5 It's the same today. There's a ﬁercely
loyal minority s ll--not many, perhaps,
but probably more than you think.
6 They're holding on, not because of
what they think they're going to get out
of it, but because they're convinced of
God's grace and purpose in choosing
them. If they were only thinking of their
own immediate self-interest, they would
have le long ago.
7 And then what happened? Well, when
Israel tried to be right with God on her
own, pursuing her own self-interest,
she didn't succeed. The chosen ones of
God were those who let God pursue his
interest in them, and as a result received
his stamp of legi macy. The "self-interest
Israel" became thick-skinned toward
God.
8 Moses and Isaiah both commented
on this: Fed up with their quarrelsome,
self-centered ways, God blurred theirROMANS 11
64
eyes and dulled their ears, Shut them in
on themselves in a hall of mirrors, and
they're there to this day.
9 David was upset about the same
thing: I hope they get sick ea ng
self-serving meals, break a leg walking
their self-serving ways.
10 I hope they go blind staring in their
mirrors, get ulcers from playing at god.
11 The next ques on is, "Are they down
for the count? Are they out of this for
good?" And the answer is a clear-cut no.
Ironically when they walked out, they
le the door open and the outsiders
walked in. But the next thing you know,
the Jews were star ng to wonder if
perhaps they had walked out on a good
thing.
12 Now, if their leaving triggered
this worldwide coming of non-Jewish
outsiders to God's kingdom, just imagineROMANS 11
65
the eﬀect of their coming back! What a
homecoming!
13 But I don't want to go on about
them. It's you, the outsiders, that
I'm concerned with now. Because my
personal assignment is focused on the
so-called outsiders, I make as much of
this as I can
14 when I'm among my Israelite kin, the
so-called insiders, hoping they'll realize
what they're missing and want to get in
on what God is doing.
15 If their falling out ini ated this
worldwide coming together, their
recovery is going to set oﬀ something
even be er: mass homecoming! If the
ﬁrst thing the Jews did, even though it
was wrong for them, turned out for your
good, just think what's going to happen
when they get it right!
16 Behind and underneath all this there
is a holy, God-planted, God-tended root.ROMANS 11
66
If the primary root of the tree is holy,
there's bound to be some holy fruit.
17 Some of the tree's branches were
pruned and you wild olive shoots were
gra ed in. Yet the fact that you are now
fed by that rich and holy root
18 gives you no cause to crow over the
pruned branches. Remember, you aren't
feeding the root; the root is feeding you.
19 It's certainly possible to say, "Other
branches were pruned so that [I] could
be gra ed in!"
20 Well and good. But they were pruned
because they were deadwood, no longer
connected by belief and commitment
to the root. The only reason you're on
the tree is because your gra "took"
when you believed, and because you're
connected to that belief-nurturing root.
So don't get cocky and strut your branch.
Be humbly mindful of the root that
keeps you lithe and green.ROMANS 11
67
21 If God didn't think twice about taking
pruning shears to the natural branches,
why would he hesitate over you? He
wouldn't give it a second thought.
22 Make sure you stay alert to these
quali es of gentle kindness and ruthless
severity that exist side by side in God--
ruthless with the deadwood, gentle with
the gra ed shoot. But don't presume
on this gentleness. The moment you
become deadwood, you're out of there.
23 And don't get to feeling superior to
those pruned branches down on the
ground. If they don't persist in remaining
deadwood, they could very well get
gra ed back in. God can do that. He can
perform miracle gra s.
24 Why, if he could gra [you]--branches
cut from a tree out in the wild--into an
orchard tree, he certainly isn't going to
have any trouble gra ing branches back
into the tree they grew from in the ﬁrstROMANS 11
68
place. Just be glad you're in the tree, and
hope for the best for the others.
25 I want to lay all this out on the
table as clearly as I can, friends. This
is complicated. It would be easy to
misinterpret what's going on and
arrogantly assume that you're royalty
and they're just rabble, out on their ears
for good. But that's not it at all. This
hardness on the part of insider Israel
toward God is temporary. Its eﬀect is to
open things up to all the outsiders so
that we end up with a full house.
26 Before it's all over, there will be
a complete Israel. As it is wri en, A
champion will stride down from the
mountain of Zion; he'll clean house in
Jacob.
27 And this is my commitment to my
people: removal of their sins.
28 From your point of view as you
hear and embrace the good news ofROMANS 11
69
the Message, it looks like the Jews are
God's enemies. But looked at from the
long-range perspec ve of God's overall
purpose, they remain God's oldest
friends.
29 God's gi s and God's call are under
full warranty--never canceled, never
rescinded.
30 There was a me not so long ago
when you were on the outs with God.
But then the Jews slammed the door on
him and things opened up for you.
31 Now they are on the outs. But with
the door held wide open for you, they
have a way back in.
32 In one way or another, God makes
sure that we all experience what it
means to be outside so that he can
personally open the door and welcome
us back in.
33 Have you ever come on anything
quite like this extravagant generosity ofROMANS 11 – 12
70
God, this deep, deep wisdom? It's way
over our heads. We'll never ﬁgure it out.
34 Is there anyone around who can
explain God? Anyone smart enough to
tell him what to do?
35 Anyone who has done him such
a huge favor that God has to ask his
advice?
36 Everything comes from him;
Everything happens through him;
Everything ends up in him. Always glory!
Always praise! Yes. Yes. Yes.
1 So here's what I want you
to do, God helping you: Take
your everyday, ordinary life--your
sleeping, ea ng, going-to-work, and
walking-around life--and place it before
God as an oﬀering. Embracing what God
does for you is the best thing you can do
for him.
2 Don't become so well-adjusted to
your culture that you ﬁt into it without
12ROMANS 12
71
even thinking. Instead, ﬁx your a en on
on God. You'll be changed from the
inside out. Readily recognize what he
wants from you, and quickly respond
to it. Unlike the culture around you,
always dragging you down to its level of
immaturity, God brings the best out of
you, develops well-formed maturity in
you.
3 I'm speaking to you out of deep
gra tude for all that God has given me,
and especially as I have responsibili es
in rela on to you. Living then, as every
one of you does, in pure grace, it's
important that you not misinterpret
yourselves as people who are bringing
this goodness to God. No, God brings
it all to you. The only accurate way to
understand ourselves is by what God is
and by what he does for us, not by what
we are and what we do for him.ROMANS 12
72
4 In this way we are like the various
parts of a human body. Each part gets its
meaning from the body as a whole, not
the other way around.
5 The body we're talking about is
Christ's body of chosen people. Each of
us ﬁnds our meaning and func on as a
part of his body. But as a chopped-oﬀ
ﬁnger or cut-oﬀ toe we wouldn't amount
to much, would we? So since we ﬁnd
ourselves fashioned into all these
excellently formed and marvelously
func oning parts in Christ's body,
6 let's just go ahead and be what we
were made to be, without enviously
or pridefully comparing ourselves with
each other, or trying to be something we
aren't. If you preach, just preach God's
Message, nothing else;
7 if you help, just help, don't take over;
if you teach, s ck to your teaching;ROMANS 12
73
8 if you give encouraging guidance,
be careful that you don't get bossy; if
you're put in charge, don't manipulate;
if you're called to give aid to people in
distress, keep your eyes open and be
quick to respond; if you work with the
disadvantaged, don't let yourself get
irritated with them or depressed by
them. Keep a smile on your face.
9 Love from the center of who you are;
don't fake it. Run for dear life from evil;
hold on for dear life to good.
10 Be good friends who love deeply;
prac ce playing second ﬁddle.
11 Don't burn out; keep yourselves
fueled and aﬂame. Be alert servants of
the Master,
12 cheerfully expectant. Don't quit in
hard mes; pray all the harder.
13 Help needy Chris ans; be inven ve
in hospitality.ROMANS 12
74
14 Bless your enemies; no cursing under
your breath.
15 Laugh with your happy friends when
they're happy; share tears when they're
down.
16 Get along with each other; don't be
stuck-up. Make friends with nobodies;
don't be the great somebody.
17 Don't hit back; discover beauty in
everyone.
18 If you've got it in you, get along with
everybody.
19 Don't insist on ge ng even; that's
not for you to do. "I'll do the judging,"
says God. "I'll take care of it."
20 Our Scriptures tell us that if you see
your enemy hungry, go buy that person
lunch, or if he's thirsty, get him a drink.
Your generosity will surprise him with
goodness.
21 Don't let evil get the best of you; get
the best of evil by doing good.ROMANS 13
1 Be a good ci
75
zen. All
governments are under
God. Insofar as there is peace and order,
it's God's order. So live responsibly as a
ci zen.
2 If you're irresponsible to the state,
then you're irresponsible with God, and
God will hold you responsible.
3 Duly cons tuted authori es are only
a threat if you're trying to get by with
something. Decent ci zens should have
nothing to fear. Do you want to be on
good terms with the government? Be a
responsible ci zen and you'll get on just
ﬁne,
4 the government working to your
advantage. But if you're breaking the
rules right and le , watch out. The police
aren't there just to be admired in their
uniforms. God also has an interest in
keeping order, and he uses them to do it.
13ROMANS 13
76
5 That's why you must live responsibly-
-not just to avoid punishment but also
because it's the right way to live.
6 That's also why you pay taxes--so that
an orderly way of life can be maintained.
7 Fulﬁll your obliga ons as a ci zen. Pay
your taxes, pay your bills, respect your
leaders.
8 Don't run up debts, except for the
huge debt of love you owe each other.
When you love others, you complete
what the law has been a er all along.
9 The law code--don't sleep with
another person's spouse, don't take
someone's life, don't take what isn't
yours, don't always be wan ng what you
don't have, and any other "don't" you
can think of--ﬁnally adds up to this: Love
other people as well as you do yourself.
10 You can't go wrong when you love
others. When you add up everything in
the law code, the sum total is [love].ROMANS 13 – 14
77
11 But make sure that you don't get so
absorbed and exhausted in taking care
of all your day-by-day obliga ons that
you lose track of the me and doze oﬀ,
oblivious to God.
12 The night is about over, dawn is
about to break. Be up and awake to what
God is doing! God is pu ng the ﬁnishing
touches on the salva on work he began
when we ﬁrst believed.
13 We can't aﬀord to waste a
minute, must not squander these
precious daylight hours in frivolity and
indulgence, in sleeping around and
dissipa on, in bickering and grabbing
everything in sight.
14 Get out of bed and get dressed!
Don't loiter and linger, wai ng un l the
very last minute. Dress yourselves in
Christ, and be up and about!
1 Welcome with open arms fellow
believers who don't see things
14ROMANS 14
78
the way you do. And don't jump all
over them every me they do or say
something you don't agree with--even
when it seems that they are strong
on opinions but weak in the faith
department. Remember, they have their
own history to deal with. Treat them
gently.
2 For instance, a person who has
been around for a while might well
be convinced that he can eat anything
on the table, while another, with a
diﬀerent background, might assume all
Chris ans should be vegetarians and eat
accordingly.
3 But since both are guests at Christ's
table, wouldn't it be terribly rude if they
fell to cri cizing what the other ate or
didn't eat? God, a er all, invited them
both to the table.
4 Do you have any business crossing
people oﬀ the guest list or interferingROMANS 14
79
with God's welcome? If there are
correc ons to be made or manners to
be learned, God can handle that without
your help.
5 Or, say, one person thinks that some
days should be set aside as holy and
another thinks that each day is pre y
much like any other. There are good
reasons either way. So, each person
is free to follow the convic ons of
conscience.
6 What's important in all this is that if
you keep a holy day, keep it for [God's]
sake; if you eat meat, eat it to the glory
of God and thank God for prime rib;
if you're a vegetarian, eat vegetables
to the glory of God and thank God for
broccoli.
7 None of us are permi ed to insist on
our own way in these ma ers.ROMANS 14
80
8 It's [God] we are answerable to--all
the way from life to death and everything
in between--not each other.
9 That's why Jesus lived and died and
then lived again: so that he could be our
Master across the en re range of life
and death, and free us from the pe y
tyrannies of each other.
10 So where does that leave you when
you cri cize a brother? And where does
that leave you when you condescend
to a sister? I'd say it leaves you looking
pre y silly--or worse. Eventually, we're
all going to end up kneeling side by side
in the place of judgment, facing God.
Your cri cal and condescending ways
aren't going to improve your posi on
there one bit.
11 Read it for yourself in Scripture: "As I
live and breathe," God says, "every knee
will bow before me; Every tongue willROMANS 14
81
tell the honest truth that I and only I am
God."
12 So tend to your kni ng. You've got
your hands full just taking care of your
own life before God.
13 Forget about deciding what's right
for each other. Here's what you need to
be concerned about: that you don't get
in the way of someone else, making life
more diﬃcult than it already is.
14 I'm convinced--Jesus convinced
me!--that everything as it is in itself is
holy. We, of course, by the way we treat
it or talk about it, can contaminate it.
15 If you confuse others by making a big
issue over what they eat or don't eat,
you're no longer a companion with them
in love, are you? These, remember, are
persons for whom Christ died. Would
you risk sending them to hell over an
item in their diet?ROMANS 14
82
16 Don't you dare let a piece of God-
blessed food become an occasion of
soul-poisoning!
17 God's kingdom isn't a ma er of what
you put in your stomach, for goodness'
sake. It's what God does with your life
as he sets it right, puts it together, and
completes it with joy.
18 Your task is to single-mindedly serve
Christ. Do that and you'll kill two birds
with one stone: pleasing the God above
you and proving your worth to the
people around you.
19 So let's agree to use all our energy
in ge ng along with each other. Help
others with encouraging words;
20 don't drag them down by ﬁnding
fault. You're certainly not going to permit
an argument over what is served or not
served at supper to wreck God's work
among you, are you? I said it before and
I'll say it again: All food is good, but itROMANS 14
83
can turn bad if you use it badly, if you
use it to trip others up and send them
sprawling.
21 When you sit down to a meal, your
primary concern should not be to feed
your own face but to share the life of
Jesus. So be sensi ve and courteous to
the others who are ea ng. Don't eat or
say or do things that might interfere with
the free exchange of love.
22 Cul vate your own rela onship with
God, but don't impose it on others.
You're fortunate if your behavior and
your belief are coherent.
23 But if you're not sure, if you no ce
that you are ac ng in ways inconsistent
with what you believe--some days trying
to impose your opinions on others, other
days just trying to please them--then
you know that you're out of line. If the
way you live isn't consistent with what
you believe, then it's wrong.ROMANS 15
15
84
1 Those of us who are strong and
able in the faith need to step in
and lend a hand to those who falter, and
not just do what is most convenient for
us. Strength is for service, not status.
2 Each one of us needs to look a er the
good of the people around us, asking
ourselves, "How can I help?"
3 That's exactly what Jesus did. He
didn't make it easy for himself by
avoiding people's troubles, but waded
right in and helped out. "I took on the
troubles of the troubled," is the way
Scripture puts it.
4 Even if it was wri en in Scripture
long ago, you can be sure it's wri en
for us. God wants the combina on of
his steady, constant calling and warm,
personal counsel in Scripture to come
to characterize us, keeping us alert for
whatever he will do next.ROMANS 15
85
5 May our dependably steady and
warmly personal God develop maturity
in you so that you get along with each
other as well as Jesus gets along with us
all.
6 Then we'll be a choir--not our voices
only, but our very lives singing in
harmony in a stunning anthem to the
God and Father of our Master Jesus!
7 So reach out and welcome one
another to God's glory. Jesus did it; now
you do it!
8 Jesus, staying true to God's purposes,
reached out in a special way to the
Jewish insiders so that the old ancestral
promises would come true for them.
9 As a result, the non-Jewish outsiders
have been able to experience mercy and
to show apprecia on to God. Just think
of all the Scriptures that will come true
in what we do! For instance: Then I'll joinROMANS 15
86
outsiders in a hymn-sing; I'll sing to your
name!
10 And this one: Outsiders and insiders,
rejoice together!
11 And again: People of all na ons,
celebrate God! All colors and races, give
hearty praise!
12 And Isaiah's word: There's the root of
our ancestor Jesse, breaking through the
earth and growing tree tall, Tall enough
for everyone everywhere to see and take
hope!
13 Oh! May the God of green hope ﬁll
you up with joy, ﬁll you up with peace,
so that your believing lives, ﬁlled with
the life-giving energy of the Holy Spirit,
will brim over with hope!
14 Personally, I've been completely
sa sﬁed with who you are and what
you are doing. You seem to me to be
well-mo vated and well-instructed,ROMANS 15
87
quite capable of guiding and advising
one another.
15 So, my dear friends, don't take
my rather bold and blunt language as
cri cism. It's not cri cism. I'm simply
underlining how very much I need your
help in carrying out this highly focused
assignment God gave me,
16 this priestly and gospel work of
serving the spiritual needs of the
non-Jewish outsiders so they can be
presented as an acceptable oﬀering to
God, made whole and holy by God's
Holy Spirit.
17 Looking back over what has been
accomplished and what I have observed,
I must say I am most pleased--in the
context of Jesus, I'd even say [proud],
but only in that context.
18 I have no interest in giving you
a cha y account of my adventures,
only the wondrously powerful andROMANS 15
88
transformingly present words and deeds
of Christ in me that triggered a believing
response among the outsiders.
19 In such ways I have trailblazed a
preaching of the Message of Jesus
all the way from Jerusalem far into
northwestern Greece.
20 This has all been pioneer work,
bringing the Message only into those
places where Jesus was not yet known
and worshiped.
21 My text has been, Those who were
never told of him--they'll see him! Those
who've never heard of him--they'll get
the message!
22 And that's why it has taken me so
long to ﬁnally get around to coming to
you.
23 But now that there is no more
pioneering work to be done in these
parts, and since I have looked forward to
seeing you for many years,ROMANS 15
89
24 I'm planning my visit. I'm headed
for Spain, and expect to stop oﬀ on the
way to enjoy a good visit with you, and
eventually have you send me oﬀ with
God's blessing.
25 First, though, I'm going to Jerusalem
to deliver a relief oﬀering to the
Chris ans there.
26 The Greeks--all the way from the
Macedonians in the north to the
Achaians in the south--decided they
wanted to take up a collec on for the
poor among the believers in Jerusalem.
27 They were happy to do this, but it
was also their duty. Seeing that they got
in on all the spiritual gi s that ﬂowed
out of the Jerusalem community so
generously, it is only right that they do
what they can to relieve their poverty.
28 As soon as I have done this--
personally handed over this "fruitROMANS 15
90
basket"--I'm oﬀ to Spain, with a stopover
with you in Rome.
29 My hope is that my visit with you
is going to be one of Christ's more
extravagant blessings.
30 I have one request, dear friends:
Pray for me. Pray strenuously with and
for me--to God the Father, through the
power of our Master Jesus, through the
love of the Spirit--
31 that I will be delivered from the lions'
den of unbelievers in Judea. Pray also
that my relief oﬀering to the Jerusalem
Chris ans will be accepted in the spirit
in which it is given.
32 Then, God willing, I'll be on my way
to you with a light and eager heart,
looking forward to being refreshed by
your company.
33 God's peace be with all of you. Oh,
yes!ROMANS 16

deserves anything you can do for her.
She's helped many a person, including
me.
3 Say hello to Priscilla and Aquila, who
have worked hand in hand with me in
serving Jesus.
4 They once put their lives on the line
for me. And I'm not the only one grateful
to them. All the non-Jewish gatherings

16 Holy embraces all around! All the
churches of Christ send their warmest
gree ngs!
17 One ﬁnal word of counsel, friends.
Keep a sharp eye out for those who take
bits and pieces of the teaching that you
learned and then use them to make
trouble. Give these people a wide berth.
18 They have no inten on of living for
our Master Christ. They're only in this for
what they can get out of it, and aren't
above using pious sweet talk to dupe
unsuspec ng innocents.ROMANS 16
94
19 And so while there has never been
any ques on about your honesty in
these ma ers--I couldn't be more proud
of you!--I want you also to be smart,
making sure every "good" thing is the
[real] thing. Don't be gullible in regard to
smooth-talking evil. Stay alert like this,
20 and before you know it the God of
peace will come down on Satan with
both feet, stomping him into the dirt.
Enjoy the best of Jesus!
21 And here are some more gree ngs
from our end. Timothy, my partner in
this work, Lucius, and my cousins Jason
and Sosipater all said to tell you hello.
22 I, Ter us, who wrote this le er at
Paul's dicta on, send you my personal
gree ngs.
23 Gaius, who is host here to both
me and the whole church, wants to be
remembered to you. Erastus, the cityROMANS 16
95
treasurer, and our good friend Quartus
send their gree ngs.
25 All of our praise rises to the One who
is strong enough to make [you] strong,
exactly as preached in Jesus Christ,
precisely as revealed in the mystery kept
secret for so long
26 but now an open book through the
prophe c Scriptures. All the na ons of
the world can now know the truth and
be brought into obedient belief, carrying
out the orders of God, who got all this
started, down to the very last le er.
27 All our praise is focused through
Jesus on this incomparably wise God!
Yes!1 Corinthians
1
1 I, Paul, have been called and sent
by Jesus, the Messiah, according
to God's plan, along with my friend
Sosthenes.
2 I send this le er to you in God's
church at Corinth, Chris ans cleaned up
by Jesus and set apart for a God-ﬁlled
life. I include in my gree ng all who call
out to Jesus, wherever they live. He's
their Master as well as ours!
3 May all the gi s and beneﬁts that
come from God our Father, and the
Master, Jesus Christ, be yours.
4 Every me I think of you--and I think
of you o en!--I thank God for your lives
of free and open access to God, given by
Jesus.1 CORINTHIANS 1
2
5 There's no end to what has happened
in you--it's beyond speech, beyond
knowledge.
6 The evidence of Christ has been
clearly veriﬁed in your lives.
7 Just think--you don't need a thing,
you've got it all! All God's gi s are right
in front of you as you wait expectantly
for our Master Jesus to arrive on the
scene for the Finale.
8 And not only that, but God himself is
right alongside to keep you steady and
on track un l things are all wrapped up
by Jesus.
9 God, who got you started in this
spiritual adventure, shares with us the
life of his Son and our Master Jesus. He
will never give up on you. Never forget
that.
10 I have a serious concern to bring up
with you, my friends, using the authority
of Jesus, our Master. I'll put it as urgently1 CORINTHIANS 1
3
as I can: You must get along with each
other. You must learn to be considerate
of one another, cul va ng a life in
common.
11 I bring this up because some from
Chloe's family brought a most disturbing
report to my a en on--that you're
ﬁgh ng among yourselves!
12 I'll tell you exactly what I was told:
You're all picking sides, going around
saying, "I'm on Paul's side," or "I'm for
Apollos," or "Peter is my man," or "I'm in
the Messiah group."
13 I ask you, "Has the Messiah been
chopped up in li le pieces so we can
each have a relic all our own? Was Paul
cruciﬁed for you? Was a single one of
you bap zed in Paul's name?"
14 I was not involved with any of
your bap sms--except for Crispus and
Gaius--and on ge ng this report, I'm
sure glad I wasn't.1 CORINTHIANS 1
4
15 At least no one can go around saying
he was bap zed in my name.
16 (Come to think of it, I also bap zed
Stephanas's family, but as far as I can
recall, that's it.)
17 God didn't send me out to collect a
following for myself, but to preach the
Message of what he has done, collec ng
a following for him. And he didn't send
me to do it with a lot of fancy rhetoric of
my own, lest the powerful ac on at the
center--Christ on the Cross--be trivialized
into mere words.
18 The Message that points to Christ on
the Cross seems like sheer silliness to
those hellbent on destruc on, but for
those on the way of salva on it makes
perfect sense. This is the way God works,
and most powerfully as it turns out.
19 It's wri en, I'll turn conven onal
wisdom on its head, I'll expose so-called
experts as crackpots.1 CORINTHIANS 1
5
20 So where can you ﬁnd someone truly
wise, truly educated, truly intelligent in
this day and age? Hasn't God exposed it
all as preten ous nonsense?
21 Since the world in all its fancy
wisdom never had a clue when it came
to knowing God, God in his wisdom
took delight in using what the world
considered dumb--[preaching], of all
things!--to bring those who trust him
into the way of salva on.
22 While Jews clamor for miraculous
demonstra ons and Greeks go in for
philosophical wisdom,
23 we go right on proclaiming Christ,
the Cruciﬁed. Jews treat this like an
[an ]-miracle--and Greeks pass it oﬀ as
absurd.
24 But to us who are personally
called by God himself--both Jews and
Greeks--Christ is God's ul mate miracle
and wisdom all wrapped up in one.1 CORINTHIANS 1
25 Human wisdom is so
6
nny, so
impotent, next to the seeming absurdity
of God. Human strength can't begin to
compete with God's "weakness."
26 Take a good look, friends, at who you
were when you got called into this life. I
don't see many of "the brightest and the
best" among you, not many inﬂuen al,
not many from high-society families.
27 Isn't it obvious that God deliberately
chose men and women that the culture
overlooks and exploits and abuses,
28 chose these "nobodies" to expose
the hollow pretensions of the
"somebodies"?
29 That makes it quite clear that none
of you can get by with blowing your own
horn before God.
30 Everything that we have--right
thinking and right living, a clean slate
and a fresh start--comes from God by
way of Jesus Christ.1 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
7
31 That's why we have the saying, "If
you're going to blow a horn, blow a
trumpet for God."
1 You'll remember, friends, that
when I ﬁrst came to you to let you
in on God's master stroke, I didn't try to
impress you with polished speeches and
the latest philosophy.
2 I deliberately kept it plain and simple:
ﬁrst Jesus and who he is; then Jesus and
what he did--Jesus cruciﬁed.
3 I was unsure of how to go about this,
and felt totally inadequate--I was scared
to death, if you want the truth of it--
4 and so nothing I said could have
impressed you or anyone else. But the
Message came through anyway. God's
Spirit and God's power did it,
5 which made it clear that your life
of faith is a response to God's power,
not to some fancy mental or emo onal
footwork by me or anyone else.
21 CORINTHIANS 2
8
6 We, of course, have plenty of wisdom
to pass on to you once you get your
feet on ﬁrm spiritual ground, but it's
not popular wisdom, the fashionable
wisdom of high-priced experts that will
be out-of-date in a year or so.
7 God's wisdom is something mysterious
that goes deep into the interior of his
purposes. You don't ﬁnd it lying around
on the surface. It's not the latest
message, but more like the oldest--what
God determined as the way to bring
out his best in us, long before we ever
arrived on the scene.
8 The experts of our day haven't a
clue about what this eternal plan is. If
they had, they wouldn't have killed the
Master of the God-designed life on a
cross.
9 That's why we have this Scripture text:
No one's ever seen or heard anything
like this, Never so much as imagined1 CORINTHIANS 2
9
anything quite like it--What God has
arranged for those who love him.
10 But you've seen and heard it because
God by his Spirit has brought it all out
into the open before you. The Spirit, not
content to ﬂit around on the surface,
dives into the depths of God, and brings
out what God planned all along.
11 Who ever knows what you're thinking
and planning except you yourself? The
same with God--except that he not only
knows what he's thinking,
12 but he lets us in on it. God oﬀers a full
report on the gi s of life and salva on
that he is giving us.
13 We don't have to rely on the world's
guesses and opinions. We didn't learn
this by reading books or going to school;
we learned it from God, who taught us
person-to-person through Jesus, and
we're passing it on to you in the same
ﬁrsthand, personal way.1 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
10
14 The unspiritual self, just as it is by
nature, can't receive the gi s of God's
Spirit. There's no capacity for them. They
seem like so much silliness. Spirit can be
known only by spirit--God's Spirit and
our spirits in open communion.
15 Spiritually alive, we have access to
everything God's Spirit is doing, and
can't be judged by unspiritual cri cs.
16 Isaiah's ques on, "Is there anyone
around who knows God's Spirit, anyone
who knows what he is doing?" has been
answered: Christ knows, and we have
Christ's Spirit.
1 But for right now, friends, I'm
completely frustrated by your
unspiritual dealings with each other and
with God. You're ac ng like infants in
rela on to Christ,
2 capable of nothing much more than
nursing at the breast. Well, then, I'll
31 CORINTHIANS 3
11
nurse you since you don't seem capable
of anything more.
3 As long as you grab for what makes
you feel good or makes you look
important, are you really much diﬀerent
than a babe at the breast, content only
when everything's going your way?
4 When one of you says, "I'm on
Paul's side," and another says, "I'm
for Apollos," aren't you being totally
infan le?
5 Who do you think Paul is, anyway? Or
Apollos, for that ma er? Servants, both
of us--servants who waited on you as
you gradually learned to entrust your
lives to our mutual Master. We each
carried out our servant assignment.
6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered
the plants, but [God] made you grow.
7 It's not the one who plants or the
one who waters who is at the center of1 CORINTHIANS 3
12
this process but God, who makes things
grow.
8 Plan ng and watering are menial
servant jobs at minimum wages.
9 What makes them worth doing is the
God we are serving. You happen to be
God's ﬁeld in which we are working.
Or, to put it another way, you are God's
house.
10 Using the gi God gave me as a
good architect, I designed blueprints;
Apollos is pu ng up the walls. Let each
carpenter who comes on the job take
care to build on the founda on!
11 Remember, there is only one
founda on, the one already laid: Jesus
Christ.
12 Take par cular care in picking out
your building materials.
13 Eventually there is going to be
an inspec on. If you use cheap or
inferior materials, you'll be found out.1 CORINTHIANS 3
13
The inspec on will be thorough and
rigorous. You won't get by with a thing.
14 If your work passes inspec on, ﬁne;
15 if it doesn't, your part of the building
will be torn out and started over. But you
won't be torn out; you'll survive--but just
barely.
16 You realize, don't you, that you are
the temple of God, and God himself is
present in you?
17 No one will get by with vandalizing
God's temple, you can be sure of
that. God's temple is sacred--and you,
remember, [are] the temple.
18 Don't fool yourself. Don't think
that you can be wise merely by being
up-to-date with the mes.
19 Be God's fool--that's the path to true
wisdom. What the world calls smart,
God calls stupid. It's wri en in Scripture,
He exposes the chicanery of the chic.1 CORINTHIANS 3 – 4
14
20 The Master sees through the smoke
screens of the know-it-alls.
21 I don't want to hear any of you
bragging about yourself or anyone else.
Everything is already yours as a gi --
22 Paul, Apollos, Peter, the world, life,
death, the present, the future--all of it is
yours,
23 and you are privileged to be in union
with Christ, who is in union with God.
1 Don't imagine us leaders to be
something we aren't. We are
servants of Christ, not his masters. We
are guides into God's most sublime
secrets, not security guards posted to
protect them.
2 The requirements for a good guide are
reliability and accurate knowledge.
3 It ma ers very li le to me what you
think of me, even less where I rank
in popular opinion. I don't even rank
41 CORINTHIANS 4
15
myself. Comparisons in these ma ers
are pointless.
4 I'm not aware of anything that would
disqualify me from being a good guide
for you, but that doesn't mean much.
The [Master] makes that judgment.
5 So don't get ahead of the Master
and jump to conclusions with your
judgments before all the evidence is in.
When he comes, he will bring out in the
open and place in evidence all kinds of
things we never even dreamed of--inner
mo ves and purposes and prayers. Only
then will any one of us get to hear the
"Well done!" of God.
6 All I'm doing right now, friends, is
showing how these things pertain to
Apollos and me so that you will learn
restraint and not rush into making
judgments without knowing all the facts.
It's important to look at things from
God's point of view. I would rather not1 CORINTHIANS 4
16
see you inﬂa ng or deﬂa ng reputa ons
based on mere hearsay.
7 For who do you know that really
knows you, knows your heart? And even
if they did, is there anything they would
discover in you that you could take
credit for? Isn't everything you [have]
and everything you [are] sheer gi s
from God? So what's the point of all this
comparing and compe ng?
8 You already have all you need. You
already have more access to God than
you can handle. Without bringing either
Apollos or me into it, you're si ng on top
of the world--at least God's world--and
we're right there, si ng alongside you!
9 It seems to me that God has put us
who bear his Message on stage in a
theater in which no one wants to buy a
cket. We're something everyone stands
around and stares at, like an accident in
the street.1 CORINTHIANS 4
17
10 We're the Messiah's misﬁts. You
might be sure of yourselves, but we live
in the midst of frail es and uncertain es.
You might be well-thought-of by others,
but we're mostly kicked around.
11 Much of the me we don't have
enough to eat, we wear patched and
threadbare clothes, we get doors
slammed in our faces,
12 and we pick up odd jobs anywhere
we can to eke out a living. When they
call us names, we say, "God bless you."
13 When they spread rumors about [us],
we put in a good word for [them]. We're
treated like garbage, potato peelings
from the culture's kitchen. And it's not
ge ng any be er.
14 I'm not wri ng all this as a
neighborhood scold just to make you
feel ro en. I'm wri ng as a father to you,
my children. I love you and want you to
grow up well, not spoiled.1 CORINTHIANS 4
18
15 There are a lot of people around who
can't wait to tell you what you've done
wrong, but there aren't many fathers
willing to take the me and eﬀort to
help you grow up. It was as Jesus helped
me proclaim God's Message to you that
I became your father.
16 I'm not, you know, asking you to do
anything I'm not already doing myself.
17 This is why I sent Timothy to you
earlier. He is also my dear son, and
true to the Master. He will refresh your
memory on the instruc ons I regularly
give all the churches on the way of
Christ.
18 I know there are some among you
who are so full of themselves they never
listen to anyone, let alone me. They
don't think I'll ever show up in person.
19 But I'll be there sooner than you
think, God willing, and then we'll see if
they're full of anything but hot air.1 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
20 God's Way is not a ma
19
er of mere
talk; it's an empowered life.
21 So how should I prepare to come
to you? As a severe disciplinarian who
makes you toe the mark? Or as a good
friend and counselor who wants to share
heart-to-heart with you? You decide.
1 I also received a report of
scandalous sex within your church
family, a kind that wouldn't be tolerated
even outside the church: One of your
men is sleeping with his stepmother.
2 And you're so above it all that it
doesn't even faze you! Shouldn't this
break your hearts? Shouldn't it bring you
to your knees in tears? Shouldn't this
person and his conduct be confronted
and dealt with?
3 I'll tell you what I would do. Even
though I'm not there in person, consider
me right there with you, because I can
fully see what's going on. I'm telling you
51 CORINTHIANS 5
20
that this is wrong. You must not simply
look the other way and hope it goes
away on its own. Bring it out in the open
and deal with it in the authority of Jesus
our Master.
4 Assemble the community--I'll be
present in spirit with you and our Master
Jesus will be present in power.
5 Hold this man's conduct up to public
scru ny. Let him defend it if he can! But
if he can't, then out with him! It will be
totally devasta ng to him, of course,
and embarrassing to you. But be er
devasta on and embarrassment than
damna on. You want him on his feet and
forgiven before the Master on the Day of
Judgment.
6 Your ﬂip and callous arrogance in
these things bothers me. You pass it oﬀ
as a small thing, but it's anything but
that. Yeast, too, is a "small thing," but it1 CORINTHIANS 5
21
works its way through a whole batch of
bread dough pre y fast.
7 So get rid of this "yeast." Our true
iden ty is ﬂat and plain, not puﬀed up
with the wrong kind of ingredient. The
Messiah, our Passover Lamb, has already
been sacriﬁced for the Passover meal,
and we are the Unraised Bread part of
the Feast.
8 So let's live out our part in the Feast,
not as raised bread swollen with the
yeast of evil, but as ﬂat bread--simple,
genuine, unpreten ous.
9 I wrote you in my earlier le er that
you shouldn't make yourselves at home
among the sexually promiscuous.
10 I didn't mean that you should have
nothing at all to do with outsiders of that
sort. Or with crooks, whether blue- or
white-collar. Or with spiritual phonies,
for that ma er. You'd have to leave the
world en rely to do that!1 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
22
11 But I am saying that you shouldn't
act as if everything is just ﬁne when
one of your Chris an companions is
promiscuous or crooked, is ﬂip with
God or rude to friends, gets drunk or
becomes greedy and predatory. You
can't just go along with this, trea ng it
as acceptable behavior.
12 I'm not responsible for what the
[outsiders] do, but don't we have some
responsibility for those within our
community of believers?
13 God decides on the outsiders, but we
need to decide when our brothers and
sisters are out of line and, if necessary,
clean house.
1 And how dare you take each other
to court! When you think you have
been wronged, does it make any sense
to go before a court that knows nothing
of God's ways instead of a family of
Chris ans?
61 CORINTHIANS 6
23
2 The day is coming when the world is
going to stand before a jury made up of
Chris ans. If someday you are going to
rule on the world's fate, wouldn't it be a
good idea to prac ce on some of these
smaller cases?
3 Why, we're even going to judge
angels! So why not these everyday
aﬀairs?
4 As these disagreements and wrongs
surface, why would you ever entrust
them to the judgment of people you
don't trust in any other way?
5 I say this as bluntly as I can to wake
you up to the stupidity of what you're
doing. Is it possible that there isn't one
levelheaded person among you who can
make fair decisions when disagreements
and disputes come up? I don't believe it.
6 And here you are taking each other
to court before people who don't even
believe in God! How can they render1 CORINTHIANS 6
24
jus ce if they don't believe in the [God]
of jus ce?
7 These court cases are an ugly blot
on your community. Wouldn't it be far
be er to just take it, to let yourselves be
wronged and forget it?
8 All you're doing is providing fuel for
more wrong, more injus ce, bringing
more hurt to the people of your own
spiritual family.
9 Don't you realize that this is not the
way to live? Unjust people who don't
care about God will not be joining in his
kingdom. Those who use and abuse each
other, use and abuse sex,
10 use and abuse the earth and
everything in it, don't qualify as ci zens
in God's kingdom.
11 A number of you know from
experience what I'm talking about, for
not so long ago you were on that list.
Since then, you've been cleaned up and1 CORINTHIANS 6
25
given a fresh start by Jesus, our Master,
our Messiah, and by our God present in
us, the Spirit.
12 Just because something is technically
legal doesn't mean that it's spiritually
appropriate. If I went around doing
whatever I thought I could get by with,
I'd be a slave to my whims.
13 You know the old saying, "First you
eat to live, and then you live to eat"?
Well, it may be true that the body is
only a temporary thing, but that's no
excuse for stuﬃng your body with food,
or indulging it with sex. Since the Master
honors you with a body, honor him with
your body!
14 God honored the Master's body by
raising it from the grave. He'll treat yours
with the same resurrec on power.
15 Un l that me, remember that your
bodies are created with the same dignity
as the Master's body. You wouldn't take1 CORINTHIANS 6
26
the Master's body oﬀ to a whorehouse,
would you? I should hope not.
16 There's more to sex than mere skin
on skin. Sex is as much spiritual mystery
as physical fact. As wri en in Scripture,
"The two become one."
17 Since we want to become spiritually
one with the Master, we must not pursue
the kind of sex that avoids commitment
and in macy, leaving us more lonely
than ever--the kind of sex that can never
"become one."
18 There is a sense in which sexual sins
are diﬀerent from all others. In sexual
sin we violate the sacredness of our own
bodies, these bodies that were made for
God-given and God-modeled love, for
"becoming one" with another.
19 Or didn't you realize that your body
is a sacred place, the place of the Holy
Spirit? Don't you see that you can't live
however you please, squandering what1 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
27
God paid such a high price for? The
physical part of you is not some piece of
property belonging to the spiritual part
of you.
20 God owns the whole works. So let
people see God in and through your
body.
1 Now, ge ng down to the ques ons
you asked in your le er to me.
First, Is it a good thing to have sexual
rela ons?
2 Certainly--but only within a certain
context. It's good for a man to have
a wife, and for a woman to have a
husband. Sexual drives are strong, but
marriage is strong enough to contain
them and provide for a balanced and
fulﬁlling sexual life in a world of sexual
disorder.
3 The marriage bed must be a place
of mutuality--the husband seeking to
71 CORINTHIANS 7
28
sa sfy his wife, the wife seeking to
sa sfy her husband.
4 Marriage is not a place to "stand up
for your rights." Marriage is a decision to
serve the other, whether in bed or out.
5 Abstaining from sex is permissible for
a period of me if you both agree to it,
and if it's for the purposes of prayer and
fas ng--but only for such mes. Then
come back together again. Satan has an
ingenious way of temp ng us when we
least expect it.
6 I'm not, understand, commanding
these periods of abs nence--only
providing my best counsel if you should
choose them.
7 Some mes I wish everyone were
single like me--a simpler life in many
ways! But celibacy is not for everyone
any more than marriage is. God gives the
gi of the single life to some, the gi of
the married life to others.1 CORINTHIANS 7
29
8 I do, though, tell the unmarried and
widows that singleness might well be
the best thing for them, as it has been
for me.
9 But if they can't manage their desires
and emo ons, they should by all
means go ahead and get married. The
diﬃcul es of marriage are preferable by
far to a sexually tortured life as a single.
10 And if you are married, stay married.
This is the Master's command, not mine.
11 If a wife should leave her husband,
she must either remain single or else
come back and make things right with
him. And a husband has no right to get
rid of his wife.
12 For the rest of you who are in
mixed marriages--Chris an married
to non-Chris an--we have no explicit
command from the Master. So this is
what you must do. If you are a man with1 CORINTHIANS 7
30
a wife who is not a believer but who s ll
wants to live with you, hold on to her.
13 If you are a woman with a husband
who is not a believer but he wants to live
with you, hold on to him.
14 The unbelieving husband shares to
an extent in the holiness of his wife,
and the unbelieving wife is likewise
touched by the holiness of her husband.
Otherwise, your children would be le
out; as it is, they also are included in the
spiritual purposes of God.
15 On the other hand, if the unbelieving
spouse walks out, you've got to let him
or her go. You don't have to hold on
desperately. God has called us to make
the best of it, as peacefully as we can.
16 You never know, wife: The way you
handle this might bring your husband
not only back to you but to God. You
never know, husband: The way you1 CORINTHIANS 7
31
handle this might bring your wife not
only back to you but to God.
17 And don't be wishing you were
someplace else or with someone else.
Where you are right now is God's place
for you. Live and obey and love and
believe right there. God, not your marital
status, deﬁnes your life. Don't think
I'm being harder on you than on the
others. I give this same counsel in all the
churches.
18 Were you Jewish at the me God
called you? Don't try to remove the
evidence. Were you non-Jewish at the
me of your call? Don't become a Jew.
19 Being Jewish isn't the point. The
really important thing is obeying God's
call, following his commands.
20 Stay where you were when God
called your name.
21 Were you a slave? Slavery is no
roadblock to obeying and believing. I1 CORINTHIANS 7
32
don't mean you're stuck and can't leave.
If you have a chance at freedom, go
ahead and take it.
22 I'm simply trying to point out that
under your new Master you're going to
experience a marvelous freedom you
would never have dreamed of. On the
other hand, if you were free when Christ
called you, you'll experience a deligh ul
"enslavement to God" you would never
have dreamed of.
23 All of you, slave and free both, were
once held hostage in a sinful society.
Then a huge sum was paid out for your
ransom. So please don't, out of old
habit, slip back into being or doing what
everyone else tells you.
24 Friends, stay where you were called
to be. God is there. Hold the high ground
with him at your side.
25 The Master did not give explicit
direc on regarding virgins, but as one1 CORINTHIANS 7
33
much experienced in the mercy of the
Master and loyal to him all the way, you
can trust my counsel.
26 Because of the current pressures
on us from all sides, I think it would
probably be best to stay just as you are.
27 Are you married? Stay married. Are
you unmarried? Don't get married.
28 But there's certainly no sin in ge ng
married, whether you're a virgin or
not. All I am saying is that when you
marry, you take on addi onal stress in
an already stressful me, and I want to
spare you if possible.
29 I do want to point out, friends, that
me is of the essence. There is no me
to waste, so don't complicate your
lives unnecessarily. Keep it simple--in
marriage,
30 grief, joy, whatever. Even in ordinary
things--your daily rou nes of shopping,
and so on.1 CORINTHIANS 7
34
31 Deal as sparingly as possible with the
things the world thrusts on you. This
world as you see it is on its way out.
32 I want you to live as free of
complica ons as possible. When you're
unmarried, you're free to concentrate
on simply pleasing the Master.
33 Marriage involves you in all the nuts
and bolts of domes c life and in wan ng
to please your spouse,
34 leading to so many more demands
on your a en on. The me and energy
that married people spend on caring for
and nurturing each other, the unmarried
can spend in becoming whole and holy
instruments of God.
35 I'm trying to be helpful and make it as
easy as possible for you, not make things
harder. All I want is for you to be able to
develop a way of life in which you can
spend plenty of me together with the
Master without a lot of distrac ons.1 CORINTHIANS 7
35
36 If a man has a woman friend to
whom he is loyal but never intended to
marry, having decided to serve God as
a "single," and then changes his mind,
deciding he should marry her, he should
go ahead and marry. It's no sin; it's not
even a "step down" from celibacy, as
some say.
37 On the other hand, if a man is
comfortable in his decision for a single
life in service to God and it's en rely his
own convic on and not imposed on him
by others, he ought to s ck with it.
38 Marriage is spiritually and morally
right and not inferior to singleness in
any way, although as I indicated earlier,
because of the mes we live in, I do
have pastoral reasons for encouraging
singleness.
39 A wife must stay with her husband
as long as he lives. If he dies, she is free
to marry anyone she chooses. She will,1 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
36
of course, want to marry a believer and
have the blessing of the Master.
40 By now you know that I think she'll
be be er oﬀ staying single. The Master,
in my opinion, thinks so, too.
1 The ques on keeps coming up
regarding meat that has been oﬀered
up to an idol: Should you a end meals
where such meat is served, or not? We
some mes tend to think we know all we
need to know to answer these kinds of
ques ons--
2 [but] some mes our humble hearts
can help us more than our proud minds.
3 We never really know enough un l we
recognize that God alone knows it all.
4 Some people say, quite rightly, that
idols have no actual existence, that
there's nothing to them, that there is no
God other than our one God,
5 that no ma er how many of these
so-called gods are named and worshiped
81 CORINTHIANS 8
37
they s ll don't add up to anything but a
tall story.
6 They say--again, quite rightly--that
there is only one God the Father, that
everything comes from him, and that he
wants us to live for him. Also, they say
that there is only one Master--Jesus the
Messiah--and that everything is for his
sake, including us. Yes. It's true.
7 In strict logic, then, nothing happened
to the meat when it was oﬀered up to
an idol. It's just like any other meat.
I know that, and you know that. But
knowing isn't everything. If it becomes
everything, some people end up
as know-it-alls who treat others as
know-nothings. Real knowledge isn't
that insensi ve. We need to be sensi ve
to the fact that we're not all at the same
level of understanding in this. Some of
you have spent your en re lives ea ng
"idol meat," and are sure that there's1 CORINTHIANS 8
38
something bad in the meat that then
becomes something bad inside of you.
An imagina on and conscience shaped
under those condi ons isn't going to
change overnight.
8 But fortunately God doesn't
grade us on our diet. We're neither
commended when we clean our plate
nor reprimanded when we just can't
stomach it.
9 But God [does] care when you use
your freedom carelessly in a way that
leads a Chris an s ll vulnerable to those
old associa ons to be thrown oﬀ track.
10 For instance, say you ﬂaunt your
freedom by going to a banquet thrown
in honor of idols, where the main course
is meat sacriﬁced to idols. Isn't there
great danger if someone s ll struggling
over this issue, someone who looks up
to you as knowledgeable and mature,
sees you go into that banquet? The1 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
39
danger is that he will become terribly
confused--maybe even to the point of
ge ng mixed up himself in what his
conscience tells him is wrong.
11 Christ gave up his life for that person.
Wouldn't you at least be willing to give
up going to dinner for him--because,
as you say, it doesn't really make
any diﬀerence? But it [does] make a
diﬀerence if you hurt your friend terribly,
risking his eternal ruin!
12 When you hurt your friend, you hurt
Christ. A free meal here and there isn't
worth it at the cost of even one of these
"weak ones."
13 So, never go to these idol-tainted
meals if there's any chance it will trip up
one of your brothers or sisters.
1 And don't tell me that I have no
authority to write like this. I'm
perfectly free to do this--isn't that
obvious? Haven't I been given a job to
91 CORINTHIANS 9
40
do? Wasn't I commissioned to this work
in a face-to-face mee ng with Jesus, our
Master? Aren't you yourselves proof of
the good work that I've done for the
Master?
2 Even if no one else admits the
authority of my commission, you can't
deny it. Why, my work with you is living
proof of my authority!
3 I'm not shy in standing up to my
cri cs.
4 We who are on missionary
assignments for God have a right
to decent accommoda ons,
5 and we have a right to support for us
and our families. You don't seem to have
raised ques ons with the other apostles
and our Master's brothers and Peter in
these ma ers.
6 So, why me? Is it just Barnabas and I
who have to go it alone and pay our own
way?1 CORINTHIANS 9
41
7 Are soldiers self-employed? Are
gardeners forbidden to eat vegetables
from their own gardens? Don't
milkmaids get to drink their ﬁll from the
pail?
8 I'm not just sounding oﬀ because
I'm irritated. This is all wri en in the
scriptural law.
9 Moses wrote, "Don't muzzle an ox to
keep it from ea ng the grain when it's
threshing." Do you think Moses' primary
concern was the care of farm animals?
10 Don't you think his concern extends
to us? Of course. Farmers plow and
thresh expec ng something when the
crop comes in.
11 So if we have planted spiritual seed
among you, is it out of line to expect a
meal or two from you?
12 Others demand plenty from you in
these ways. Don't we who have never
demanded deserve even more? But1 CORINTHIANS 9
42
we're not going to start demanding now
what we've always had a perfect right
to. Our decision all along has been to
put up with anything rather than to get
in the way or detract from the Message
of Christ.
13 All I'm concerned with right now is
that you not use our decision to take
advantage of others, depriving them
of what is rightly theirs. You know,
don't you, that it's always been taken
for granted that those who work in
the Temple live oﬀ the proceeds of
the Temple, and that those who oﬀer
sacriﬁces at the altar eat their meals
from what has been sacriﬁced?
14 Along the same lines, the Master
directed that those who spread the
Message be supported by those who
believe the Message.
15 S ll, I want it made clear that I've
never go en anything out of this for1 CORINTHIANS 9
43
myself, and that I'm not wri ng now to
get something. I'd rather die than give
anyone ammuni on to discredit me or
impugn my mo ves.
16 If I proclaim the Message, it's not to
get something out of it for myself. I'm
[compelled] to do it, and doomed if I
don't!
17 If this was my own idea of just
another way to make a living, I'd expect
some pay. But since it's [not] my idea but
something solemnly entrusted to me,
why would I expect to get paid?
18 So am I ge ng anything out of it?
Yes, as a ma er of fact: the pleasure
of proclaiming the Message at no cost
to you. You don't even have to pay my
expenses!
19 Even though I am free of the
demands and expecta ons of everyone,
I have voluntarily become a servant to1 CORINTHIANS 9
44
any and all in order to reach a wide
range of people:
20 religious, nonreligious,
21 me culous moralists, loose-living
immoralists,
22 the defeated, the demoralized--
whoever. I didn't take on their way of
life. I kept my bearings in Christ--but
I entered their world and tried to
experience things from their point of
view. I've become just about every sort
of servant there is in my a empts to lead
those I meet into a God-saved life.
23 I did all this because of the Message. I
didn't just want to talk about it; I wanted
to be [in] on it!
24 You've all been to the stadium and
seen the athletes race. Everyone runs;
one wins. Run to win.
25 All good athletes train hard. They
do it for a gold medal that tarnishes1 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
45
and fades. You're a er one that's gold
eternally.
26 I don't know about you, but I'm
running hard for the ﬁnish line. I'm giving
it everything I've got. No sloppy living for
me!
27 I'm staying alert and in top condi on.
I'm not going to get caught napping,
telling everyone else all about it and
then missing out myself.
1 Remember our history, friends,
and be warned. All our ancestors
were led by the providen al Cloud and
taken miraculously through the Sea.
2 They went through the waters, in a
bap sm like ours, as Moses led them
from enslaving death to salva on life.
3 They all ate
4 and drank iden cal food and drink,
meals provided daily by God. They drank
from the Rock, God's fountain for them
101 CORINTHIANS 10
46
that stayed with them wherever they
were. And the Rock was Christ.
5 But just experiencing God's wonder
and grace didn't seem to mean
much--most of them were defeated by
tempta on during the hard mes in the
desert, and God was not pleased.
6 The same thing could happen to us.
We must be on guard so that we never
get caught up in wan ng our own way as
they did.
7 And we must not turn our religion into
a circus as they did--"First the people
par ed, then they threw a dance."
8 We must not be sexually promiscuous-
-they paid for that, remember, with
twenty-three thousand deaths in one
day!
9 We must never try to get Christ to
serve us instead of us serving him; they
tried it, and God launched an epidemic
of poisonous snakes.1 CORINTHIANS 10
10 We must be careful not to s
47
r up
discontent; discontent destroyed them.
11 These are all warning markers--
DANGER!--in our history books, wri en
down so that we don't repeat their
mistakes. Our posi ons in the story are
parallel--they at the beginning, we at
the end--and we are just as capable of
messing it up as they were.
12 Don't be so naive and self-conﬁdent.
You're not exempt. You could fall ﬂat on
your face as easily as anyone else. Forget
about self-conﬁdence; it's useless.
Cul vate God-conﬁdence.
13 No test or tempta on that comes
your way is beyond the course of what
others have had to face. All you need to
remember is that God will never let you
down; he'll never let you be pushed past
your limit; he'll always be there to help
you come through it.1 CORINTHIANS 10
48
14 So, my very dear friends, when you
see people reducing God to something
they can use or control, get out of their
company as fast as you can.
15 I assume I'm addressing believers
now who are mature. Draw your own
conclusions:
16 When we drink the cup of blessing,
aren't we taking into ourselves the
blood, the very life, of Christ? And isn't it
the same with the loaf of bread we break
and eat? Don't we take into ourselves
the body, the very life, of Christ?
17 Because there is one loaf, our
many-ness becomes one-ness--Christ
doesn't become fragmented in us.
Rather, we become uniﬁed in him. We
don't reduce Christ to what we are; he
raises us to what he is.
18 That's basically what happened even
in old Israel--those who ate the sacriﬁces1 CORINTHIANS 10
49
oﬀered on God's altar entered into God's
ac on at the altar.
19 Do you see the diﬀerence? Sacriﬁces
oﬀered to idols are oﬀered to nothing,
for what's the idol but a nothing?
20 Or worse than nothing, a minus, a
demon! I don't want you to become part
of something that reduces you to less
than yourself.
21 And you can't have it both ways,
banque ng with the Master one day and
slumming with demons the next.
22 Besides, the Master won't put up
with it. He wants us--all or nothing. Do
you think you can get oﬀ with anything
less?
23 Looking at it one way, you could
say, "Anything goes. Because of God's
immense generosity and grace, we don't
have to dissect and scru nize every
ac on to see if it will pass muster." But
the point is not to just get by.1 CORINTHIANS 10
50
24 We want to live well, but our
foremost eﬀorts should be to help others
live well.
25 With that as a base to work from,
common sense can take you the rest of
the way. Eat anything sold at the butcher
shop, for instance; you don't have to run
an "idolatry test" on every item.
26 "The earth," a er all, "is God's, and
everything in it." That "everything"
certainly includes the leg of lamb in the
butcher shop.
27 If a nonbeliever invites you to
dinner and you feel like going, go ahead
and enjoy yourself; eat everything
placed before you. It would be both
bad manners and bad spirituality to
cross-examine your host on the ethical
purity of each course as it is served.
28 On the other hand, if he goes out of
his way to tell you that this or that was
sacriﬁced to god or goddess so-and-so,1 CORINTHIANS 10
51
you should pass. Even though you may
be indiﬀerent as to where it came from,
he isn't, and you don't want to send
mixed messages to him about who [you]
are worshiping.
29 But, except for these special cases,
I'm not going to walk around on
eggshells worrying about what small-
minded people might say; I'm going to
stride free and easy, knowing what our
large-minded Master has already said.
30 If I eat what is served to me, grateful
to God for what is on the table, how can
I worry about what someone will say? I
thanked God for it and he blessed it!
31 So eat your meals hear ly, not
worrying about what others say about
you--you're ea ng to God's glory, a er
all, not to please them. As a ma er of
fact, do everything that way, hear ly and
freely to God's glory.1 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
32 At the same
52
me, don't be callous in
your exercise of freedom, thoughtlessly
stepping on the toes of those who aren't
as free as you are.
33 I try my best to be considerate of
everyone's feelings in all these ma ers; I
hope you will be, too.
1 It pleases me that you con nue
to remember and honor me by
keeping up the tradi ons of the faith I
taught you. All actual authority stems
from Christ.
3 In a marriage rela onship, there is
authority from Christ to husband, and
from husband to wife. The authority of
Christ is the authority of God.
4 Any man who speaks with God or
about God in a way that shows a lack
of respect for the authority of Christ,
dishonors Christ.
5 In the same way, a wife who speaks
with God in a way that shows a lack of
111 CORINTHIANS 11
53
respect for the authority of her husband,
dishonors her husband.
6 Worse, she dishonors herself--an
ugly sight, like a woman with her head
shaved. This is basically the origin of
these customs we have of women
wearing head coverings in worship,
while men take their hats oﬀ. By these
symbolic acts,
7 men and women, who far too o en
bu heads with each other, submit their
"heads" to the Head: God.
10 Don't, by the way, read too much
into the diﬀerences here between men
and women.
11 Neither man nor woman can go it
alone or claim priority. Man was created
ﬁrst, as a beau ful shining reﬂec on
of God--that is true. But the head on
a woman's body clearly outshines in
beauty the head of her "head," her
husband.1 CORINTHIANS 11
54
12 The ﬁrst woman came from man,
true--but ever since then, every man
comes from a woman! And since virtually
everything comes from God anyway,
let's quit going through these "who's
ﬁrst" rou nes.
13 Don't you agree there is something
naturally powerful in the symbolism--a
woman, her beau ful hair reminiscent
of angels, praying in adora on; a man,
his head bared in reverence, praying in
submission?
16 I hope you're not going to be
argumenta ve about this. All God's
churches see it this way; I don't want
you standing out as an excep on.
17 Regarding this next item, I'm not at
all pleased. I am ge ng the picture that
when you meet together it brings out
your worst side instead of your best!
18 First, I get this report on your
divisiveness, compe ng with and1 CORINTHIANS 11
55
cri cizing each other. I'm reluctant to
believe it, but there it is.
19 The best that can be said for it is that
the tes ng process will bring truth into
the open and conﬁrm it.
20 And then I ﬁnd that you bring your
divisions to worship--you come together,
and instead of ea ng the Lord's Supper,
21 you bring in a lot of food from the
outside and make pigs of yourselves.
Some are le out, and go home hungry.
Others have to be carried out, too drunk
to walk. I can't believe it!
22 Don't you have your own homes to
eat and drink in? Why would you stoop
to desecra ng God's church? Why would
you actually shame God's poor? I never
would have believed you would stoop to
this. And I'm not going to stand by and
say nothing.
23 Let me go over with you again exactly
what goes on in the Lord's Supper1 CORINTHIANS 11
56
and why it is so centrally important.
I received my instruc ons from the
Master himself and passed them on to
you. The Master, Jesus, on the night of
his betrayal, took bread.
24 Having given thanks, he broke it and
said, This is my body, broken for you. Do
this to remember me.
25 A er supper, he did the same thing
with the cup: This cup is my blood, my
new covenant with you. Each me you
drink this cup, remember me.
26 What you must solemnly realize
is that every me you eat this bread
and every me you drink this cup, you
reenact in your words and ac ons the
death of the Master. You will be drawn
back to this meal again and again un l
the Master returns. You must never let
familiarity breed contempt.
27 Anyone who eats the bread or drinks
the cup of the Master irreverently is like1 CORINTHIANS 11
57
part of the crowd that jeered and spit
on him at his death. Is that the kind of
"remembrance" you want to be part of?
28 Examine your mo ves, test your
heart, come to this meal in holy awe.
29 If you give no thought (or worse,
don't care) about the broken body of
the Master when you eat and drink,
you're running the risk of serious
consequences.
30 That's why so many of you even now
are listless and sick, and others have
gone to an early grave.
31 If we get this straight now, we won't
have to be straightened out later on.
32 Be er to be confronted by the Master
now than to face a ﬁery confronta on
later.
33 So, my friends, when you come
together to the Lord's Table, be reverent
and courteous with one another.1 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
58
34 If you're so hungry that you can't
wait to be served, go home and get a
sandwich. But by no means risk turning
this Meal into an ea ng and drinking
binge or a family squabble. It is a spiritual
meal--a love feast. The other things you
asked about, I'll respond to in person
when I make my next visit.
1 What I want to talk about now is
the various ways God's Spirit gets
worked into our lives. This is complex
and o en misunderstood, but I want you
to be informed and knowledgeable.
2 Remember how you were when you
didn't know God, led from one phony
god to another, never knowing what
you were doing, just doing it because
everybody else did it? It's diﬀerent in this
life. God wants us to use our intelligence,
to seek to understand as well as we can.
3 For instance, by using your heads, you
know perfectly well that the Spirit of
121 CORINTHIANS 12
59
God would never prompt anyone to say
"Jesus be damned!" Nor would anyone
be inclined to say "Jesus is Master!"
without the insight of the Holy Spirit.
4 God's various gi s are handed out
everywhere; but they all originate in
God's Spirit.
5 God's various ministries are carried
out everywhere; but they all originate in
God's Spirit.
6 God's various expressions of power
are in ac on everywhere; but God
himself is behind it all.
7 Each person is given something to do
that shows who God is: Everyone gets
in on it, everyone beneﬁts. All kinds of
things are handed out by the Spirit, and
to all kinds of people!
8 The variety is wonderful: wise counsel
clear understanding
9 simple trust healing the sick1 CORINTHIANS 12
10 miraculous acts proclama
60
on
dis nguishing between spirits tongues
interpreta on of tongues.
11 All these gi s have a common origin,
but are handed out one by one by the
one Spirit of God. He decides who gets
what, and when.
12 You can easily enough see how this
kind of thing works by looking no further
than your own body. Your body has
many parts--limbs, organs, cells--but no
ma er how many parts you can name,
you're s ll one body. It's exactly the
same with Christ.
13 By means of his one Spirit, we all said
good-bye to our par al and piecemeal
lives. We each used to independently
call our own shots, but then we entered
into a large and integrated life in which
[he] has the ﬁnal say in everything. (This
is what we proclaimed in word and
ac on when we were bap zed.) Each1 CORINTHIANS 12
61
of us is now a part of his resurrec on
body, refreshed and sustained at one
fountain--his Spirit--where we all come
to drink. The old labels we once used
to iden fy ourselves--labels like Jew
or Greek, slave or free--are no longer
useful. We need something larger, more
comprehensive.
14 I want you to think about how all
this makes you more signiﬁcant, not
less. A body isn't just a single part blown
up into something huge. It's all the
diﬀerent-but-similar parts arranged and
func oning together.
15 If Foot said, "I'm not elegant like
Hand, embellished with rings; I guess I
don't belong to this body," would that
make it so?
16 If Ear said, "I'm not beau ful like Eye,
limpid and expressive; I don't deserve a
place on the head," would you want to
remove it from the body?1 CORINTHIANS 12
62
17 If the body was all eye, how could it
hear? If all ear, how could it smell?
18 As it is, we see that God has carefully
placed each part of the body right where
he wanted it.
19 But I also want you to think about
how this keeps your signiﬁcance from
ge ng blown up into self-importance.
For no ma er how signiﬁcant you are, it
is only because of what you are a [part]
of. An enormous eye or a gigan c hand
wouldn't be a body, but a monster.
20 What we have is one body with many
parts, each its proper size and in its
proper place. No part is important on its
own.
21 Can you imagine Eye telling Hand,
"Get lost; I don't need you"? Or, Head
telling Foot, "You're ﬁred; your job has
been phased out"?
22 As a ma er of fact, in prac ce it
works the other way--the "lower" the1 CORINTHIANS 12
63
part, the more basic, and therefore
necessary. You can live without an eye,
for instance, but not without a stomach.
23 When it's a part of your own body
you are concerned with, it makes [no]
diﬀerence whether the part is visible
or clothed, higher or lower. You give it
dignity and honor just as it is, without
comparisons.
24 If anything, you have more concern
for the lower parts than the higher. If
you had to choose, wouldn't you prefer
good diges on to full-bodied hair?
25 The way God designed our bodies
is a model for understanding our
lives together as a church: every part
dependent on every other part, the parts
we men on and the parts we don't,
26 the parts we see and the parts we
don't. If one part hurts, every other
part is involved in the hurt, and in the1 CORINTHIANS 12
64
healing. If one part ﬂourishes, every
other part enters into the exuberance.
27 You are Christ's body--that's who you
are! You must never forget this. Only as
you accept your part of that body does
your "part" mean anything.
28 You're familiar with some of the
parts that God has formed in his church,
which is his "body": apostles prophets
teachers miracle workers healers helpers
organizers those who pray in tongues.
29 But it's obvious by now, isn't it, that
Christ's church is a complete Body and
not a gigan c, unidimensional Part? It's
not all Apostle, not all Prophet, not all
Miracle Worker,
30 not all Healer, not all Prayer in
Tongues, not all Interpreter of Tongues.
31 And yet some of you keep compe ng
for so-called "important" parts. But now
I want to lay out a far be er way for you.1 CORINTHIANS 13
13
65
1 If I speak with human eloquence
and angelic ecstasy but don't
love, I'm nothing but the creaking of a
rusty gate.
2 If I speak God's Word with power,
revealing all his mysteries and making
everything plain as day, and if I have faith
that says to a mountain, "Jump," and it
jumps, but I don't love, I'm nothing.
3 If I give everything I own to the poor
and even go to the stake to be burned
as a martyr, but I don't love, I've go en
nowhere. So, no ma er what I say, what
I believe, and what I do, I'm bankrupt
without love.
4 Love never gives up. Love cares more
for others than for self. Love doesn't
want what it doesn't have. Love doesn't
strut, Doesn't have a swelled head,
5 Doesn't force itself on others, Isn't
always "me ﬁrst," Doesn't ﬂy oﬀ the1 CORINTHIANS 13
66
handle, Doesn't keep score of the sins of
others,
6 Doesn't revel when others grovel,
Takes pleasure in the ﬂowering of truth,
7 Puts up with anything, Trusts God
always, Always looks for the best, Never
looks back, But keeps going to the end.
8 Love never dies. Inspired speech will
be over some day; praying in tongues
will end; understanding will reach its
limit.
9 We know only a por on of the truth,
and what we say about God is always
incomplete.
10 But when the Complete arrives, our
incompletes will be canceled.
11 When I was an infant at my mother's
breast, I gurgled and cooed like any
infant. When I grew up, I le those infant
ways for good.
12 We don't yet see things clearly. We're
squin ng in a fog, peering through a1 CORINTHIANS 13 – 14
67
mist. But it won't be long before the
weather clears and the sun shines bright!
We'll see it all then, see it all as clearly as
God sees us, knowing him directly just as
he knows us!
13 But for right now, un l that
completeness, we have three things to
do to lead us toward that consumma on:
Trust steadily in God, hope unswervingly,
love extravagantly. And the best of the
three is love.
1 Go a er a life of love as if your
life depended on it--because it
does. Give yourselves to the gi s God
gives you. Most of all, try to proclaim his
truth.
2 If you praise him in the private
language of tongues, God understands
you but no one else does, for you are
sharing in macies just between you and
him.
141 CORINTHIANS 14
68
3 But when you proclaim his truth in
everyday speech, you're le ng [others]
in on the truth so that they can grow and
be strong and experience his presence
with you.
4 The one who prays using a private
"prayer language" certainly gets a lot
out of it, but proclaiming God's truth
to the church in its common language
brings the whole church into growth and
strength.
5 I want all of you to develop in macies
with God in prayer, but please don't stop
with that. Go on and proclaim his clear
truth to others. It's more important that
everyone have access to the knowledge
and love of God in language everyone
understands than that you go oﬀ and
cul vate God's presence in a mysterious
prayer language--unless, of course, there
is someone who can interpret what you
are saying for the beneﬁt of all.1 CORINTHIANS 14
69
6 Think, friends: If I come to you and all
I do is pray privately to God in a way only
he can understand, what are you going
to get out of that? If I don't address you
plainly with some insight or truth or
proclama on or teaching, what help am
I to you?
7 If musical instruments--ﬂutes, say, or
harps--aren't played so that each note is
dis nct and in tune, how will anyone be
able to catch the melody and enjoy the
music?
8 If the trumpet call can't be
dis nguished, will anyone show up
for the ba le?
9 So if you speak in a way no one can
understand, what's the point of opening
your mouth?
10 There are many languages in the
world and they all mean something to
someone.1 CORINTHIANS 14
70
11 But if [I] don't understand the
language, it's not going to do me much
good.
12 It's no diﬀerent with you. Since
you're so eager to par cipate in what
God is doing, why don't you concentrate
on doing what helps everyone in the
church?
13 So, when you pray in your private
prayer language, don't hoard the
experience for yourself. Pray for the
insight and ability to bring others into
that in macy.
14 If I pray in tongues, my spirit prays
but my mind lies fallow, and all that
intelligence is wasted.
15 So what's the solu on? The answer
is simple enough. Do both. I should be
spiritually free and expressive as I pray,
but I should also be though ul and
mindful as I pray. I should sing with my
spirit, and sing with my mind.1 CORINTHIANS 14
71
16 If you give a blessing using your
private prayer language, which no
one else understands, how can some
outsider who has just shown up and has
no idea what's going on know when to
say "Amen"?
17 Your blessing might be beau ful, but
you have very eﬀec vely cut that person
out of it.
18 I'm grateful to God for the gi of
praying in tongues that he gives us for
praising him, which leads to wonderful
in macies we enjoy with him. I enter
into this as much or more than any of
you.
19 But when I'm in a church assembled
for worship, I'd rather say ﬁve words
that everyone can understand and learn
from than say ten thousand that sound
to others like gibberish.
20 To be perfectly frank, I'm ge ng
exasperated with your infan le thinking.1 CORINTHIANS 14
72
How long before you grow up and use
your head--your [adult] head? It's all
right to have a childlike unfamiliarity
with evil; a simple [no] is all that's
needed there. But there's far more to
saying [yes] to something. Only mature
and well-exercised intelligence can save
you from falling into gullibility.
21 It's wri en in Scripture that God said,
In strange tongues and from the mouths
of strangers I will preach to this people,
but they'll neither listen nor believe.
22 So where does it get you, all
this speaking in tongues no one
understands? It doesn't help believers,
and it only gives unbelievers something
to gawk at. Plain truth-speaking, on the
other hand, goes straight to the heart of
believers and doesn't get in the way of
unbelievers.
23 If you come together as a
congrega on and some unbelieving1 CORINTHIANS 14
73
outsiders walk in on you as you're all
praying in tongues, unintelligible to each
other and to them, won't they assume
you've taken leave of your senses and
get out of there as fast as they can?
24 But if some unbelieving outsiders
walk in on a service where people are
speaking out God's truth, the plain
words will bring them up against the
truth
25 and probe their hearts. Before you
know it, they're going to be on their
faces before God, recognizing that God
is among you.
26 So here's what I want you to do.
When you gather for worship, each one
of you be prepared with something that
will be useful for all: Sing a hymn, teach a
lesson, tell a story, lead a prayer, provide
an insight.
27 If prayers are oﬀered in tongues,
two or three's the limit, and then only if1 CORINTHIANS 14
74
someone is present who can interpret
what you're saying.
28 Otherwise, keep it between God and
yourself.
29 And no more than two or three
speakers at a mee ng, with the rest of
you listening and taking it to heart.
30 Take your turn, no one person taking
over.
31 Then each speaker gets a chance to
say something special from God, and
you all learn from each other.
32 If you choose to speak, you're also
responsible for how and when you
speak.
33 When we worship the right way, God
doesn't s r us up into confusion; he
brings us into harmony. This goes for all
the churches--no excep ons.
34 Wives must not disrupt worship,
talking when they should be listening,1 CORINTHIANS 14
35 asking ques
75
ons that could more
appropriately be asked of their husbands
at home. God's Book of the law guides
our manners and customs here. Wives
have no license to use the me of
worship for unwarranted speaking.
36 Do you--both women [and] men-
-imagine that you're a sacred oracle
determining what's right and wrong? Do
you think everything revolves around
you?
37 If any one of you thinks God has
something for you to say or has inspired
you to do something, pay close a en on
to what I have wri en. This is the way
the Master wants it.
38 If you won't play by these rules, God
can't use you. Sorry.
39 Three things, then, to sum this up:
When you speak forth God's truth, speak
your heart out. Don't tell people how
they should or shouldn't pray when1 CORINTHIANS 14 – 15
76
they're praying in tongues that you don't
understand.
40 Be courteous and considerate in
everything.
1 Friends, let me go over the
Message with you one ﬁnal
me--this Message that I proclaimed
and that you made your own; this
Message on which you took your stand
2 and by which your life has been saved.
(I'm assuming, now, that your belief was
the real thing and not a passing fancy,
that you're in this for good and holding
fast.)
3 The ﬁrst thing I did was place before
you what was placed so empha cally
before me: that the Messiah died for our
sins, exactly as Scripture tells it;
4 that he was buried; that he was
raised from death on the third day, again
exactly as Scripture says;
151 CORINTHIANS 15
77
5 that he presented himself alive to
Peter, then to his closest followers,
6 and later to more than ﬁve hundred
of his followers all at the same me,
most of them s ll around (although a
few have since died);
7 that he then spent me with James
and the rest of those he commissioned
to represent him;
8 and that he ﬁnally presented himself
alive to [me].
9 It was ﬁ ng that I bring up the rear.
I don't deserve to be included in that
inner circle, as you well know, having
spent all those early years trying my
best to stamp God's church right out of
existence.
10 But because God was so gracious,
so very generous, here I am. And I'm
not about to let his grace go to waste.
Haven't I worked hard trying to do more
than any of the others? Even then, my1 CORINTHIANS 15
78
work didn't amount to all that much. It
was God giving me the work to do, God
giving me the energy to do it.
11 So whether you heard it from me or
from those others, it's all the same: We
spoke God's truth and you entrusted
your lives.
12 Now, let me ask you something
profound yet troubling. If you became
believers because you trusted the
proclama on that Christ is alive, risen
from the dead, how can you let people
say that there is no such thing as a
resurrec on?
13 If there's no resurrec on, there's no
living Christ.
14 And face it--if there's no resurrec on
for Christ, everything we've told you
is smoke and mirrors, and everything
you've staked your life on is smoke and
mirrors.1 CORINTHIANS 15
79
15 Not only that, but we would be guilty
of telling a string of barefaced lies about
God, all these aﬃdavits we passed on
to you verifying that God raised up
Christ--sheer fabrica ons, if there's no
resurrec on.
16 If corpses can't be raised, then Christ
wasn't, because he was indeed dead.
17 And if Christ wasn't raised, then all
you're doing is wandering about in the
dark, as lost as ever.
18 It's even worse for those who died
hoping in Christ and resurrec on,
because they're already in their graves.
19 If all we get out of Christ is a li le
inspira on for a few short years, we're a
pre y sorry lot.
20 But the truth is that Christ [has]
been raised up, the ﬁrst in a long legacy
of those who are going to leave the
cemeteries.1 CORINTHIANS 15
80
21 There is a nice symmetry in this:
Death ini ally came by a man, and
resurrec on from death came by a man.
22 Everybody dies in Adam; everybody
comes alive in Christ.
23 But we have to wait our turn: Christ is
ﬁrst, then those with him at his Coming,
24 the grand consumma on when, a er
crushing the opposi on, he hands over
his kingdom to God the Father.
25 He won't let up un l the last enemy
is down--
26 and the very last enemy is death!
27 As the psalmist said, "He laid them
low, one and all; he walked all over
them." When Scripture says that "he
walked all over them," it's obvious that
he couldn't at the same me be walked
on.
28 When everything and everyone
is ﬁnally under God's rule, the Son
will step down, taking his place with1 CORINTHIANS 15
81
everyone else, showing that God's rule
is absolutely comprehensive--a perfect
ending!
29 Why do you think people oﬀer
themselves to be bap zed for those
already in the grave? If there's no
chance of resurrec on for a corpse,
if God's power stops at the cemetery
gates, why do we keep doing things that
suggest he's going to clean the place out
someday, pulling everyone up on their
feet alive?
30 And why do you think I keep risking
my neck in this dangerous work?
31 I look death in the face prac cally
every day I live. Do you think I'd do
this if I wasn't convinced of your
resurrec on and mine as guaranteed by
the resurrected Messiah Jesus?
32 Do you think I was just trying to act
heroic when I fought the wild beasts at
Ephesus, hoping it wouldn't be the end1 CORINTHIANS 15
82
of me? Not on your life! It's resurrec on,
resurrec on, always resurrec on, that
undergirds what I do and say, the way
I live. If there's no resurrec on, "We
eat, we drink, the next day we die," and
that's all there is to it.
33 But don't fool yourselves. Don't let
yourselves be poisoned by this an -
resurrec on loose talk. "Bad company
ruins good manners."
34 Think straight. Awaken to the
holiness of life. No more playing fast and
loose with resurrec on facts. Ignorance
of God is a luxury you can't aﬀord in
mes like these. Aren't you embarrassed
that you've let this kind of thing go on as
long as you have?
35 Some skep c is sure to ask, "Show
me how resurrec on works. Give me a
diagram; draw me a picture. What does
this 'resurrec on body' look like?"1 CORINTHIANS 15
36 If you look at this ques
83
on closely,
you realize how absurd it is. There are
no diagrams for this kind of thing.
37 We do have a parallel experience in
gardening. You plant a "dead" seed; soon
there is a ﬂourishing plant. There is no
visual likeness between seed and plant.
38 You could never guess what a tomato
would look like by looking at a tomato
seed. What we plant in the soil and
what grows out of it don't look anything
alike. The dead body that we bury in
the ground and the resurrec on body
that comes from it will be drama cally
diﬀerent.
39 You will no ce that the variety of
bodies is stunning. Just as there are
diﬀerent kinds of seeds, there are
diﬀerent kinds of bodies--humans,
animals, birds, ﬁsh--each unprecedented
in its form.1 CORINTHIANS 15
84
40 You get a hint at the diversity of
resurrec on glory by looking at the
diversity of bodies not only on earth but
in the skies--
41 sun, moon, stars--all these varie es
of beauty and brightness. And we're only
looking at pre-resurrec on "seeds"--who
can imagine what the resurrec on
"plants" will be like!
42 This image of plan ng a dead
seed and raising a live plant is a mere
sketch at best, but perhaps it will help
in approaching the mystery of the
resurrec on body--but only if you keep
in mind that when we're raised, we're
raised for [good], alive forever!
43 The corpse that's planted is no
beauty, but when it's raised, it's glorious.
Put in the ground weak, it comes up
powerful.
44 The seed sown is natural; the seed
grown is supernatural--same seed, same1 CORINTHIANS 15
85
body, but what a diﬀerence from when it
goes down in physical mortality to when
it is raised up in spiritual immortality!
45 We follow this sequence in Scripture:
The First Adam received life, the Last
Adam is a life-giving Spirit.
46 Physical life comes ﬁrst, then
spiritual--
47 a ﬁrm base shaped from the earth, a
ﬁnal comple on coming out of heaven.
48 The First Man was made out of earth,
and people since then are earthy; the
Second Man was made out of heaven,
and people now can be heavenly.
49 In the same way that we've worked
from our earthy origins, let's embrace
our heavenly ends.
50 I need to emphasize, friends, that our
natural, earthy lives don't in themselves
lead us by their very nature into the
kingdom of God. Their very "nature" is1 CORINTHIANS 15
86
to die, so how could they "naturally" end
up in the Life kingdom?
51 But let me tell you something
wonderful, a mystery I'll probably never
fully understand. We're not all going to
die--but we are all going to be changed.
52 You hear a blast to end all blasts
from a trumpet, and in the me that you
look up and blink your eyes--it's over. On
signal from that trumpet from heaven,
the dead will be up and out of their
graves, beyond the reach of death, never
to die again. At the same moment and in
the same way, we'll all be changed.
53 In the resurrec on scheme of
things, this has to happen: everything
perishable taken oﬀ the shelves and
replaced by the imperishable, this
mortal replaced by the immortal.
54 Then the saying will come true:
Death swallowed by triumphant Life!1 CORINTHIANS 15 – 16
87
55 Who got the last word, oh, Death?
Oh, Death, who's afraid of you now?
56 It was sin that made death so
frightening and law-code guilt that gave
sin its leverage, its destruc ve power.
57 But now in a single victorious stroke
of Life, all three--sin, guilt, death--are
gone, the gi of our Master, Jesus Christ.
Thank God!
58 With all this going for us, my dear,
dear friends, stand your ground. And
don't hold back. Throw yourselves into
the work of the Master, conﬁdent that
nothing you do for him is a waste of me
or eﬀort.
1 Regarding the relief oﬀering
for poor Chris ans that is being
collected, you get the same instruc ons
I gave the churches in Gala a.
2 Every Sunday each of you make an
oﬀering and put it in safekeeping. Be as
generous as you can. When I get there
161 CORINTHIANS 16
88
you'll have it ready, and I won't have to
make a special appeal.
3 Then a er I arrive, I'll write le ers
authorizing whomever you delegate, and
send them oﬀ to Jerusalem to deliver
your gi .
4 If you think it best that I go along, I'll
be glad to travel with them.
5 I plan to visit you a er passing through
northern Greece. I won't be staying long
there,
6 but maybe I can stay awhile with
you--maybe even spend the winter?
Then you could give me a good send-oﬀ,
wherever I may be headed next.
7 I don't want to just drop by in between
other "primary" des na ons. I want a
good, long, leisurely visit. If the Master
agrees, we'll have it!
8 For the present, I'm staying right here
in Ephesus.1 CORINTHIANS 16
89
9 A huge door of opportunity for good
work has opened up here. (There is also
mushrooming opposi on.)
10 If Timothy shows up, take good care
of him. Make him feel completely at
home among you. He works so hard for
the Master, just as I do.
11 Don't let anyone disparage him. A er
a while, send him on to me with your
blessing. Tell him I'm expec ng him, and
any friends he has with him.
12 About our friend Apollos, I've done
my best to get him to pay you a visit, but
haven't talked him into it yet. He doesn't
think this is the right me. But there will
be a "right me."
13 Keep your eyes open, hold ght to
your convic ons, give it all you've got,
be resolute,
14 and love without stopping.
15 Would you do me a favor, friends,
and give special recogni on to the family1 CORINTHIANS 16
90
of Stephanas? You know, they were
among the ﬁrst converts in Greece, and
they've put themselves out, serving
Chris ans ever since then. I want you to
16 honor and look up to people like that:
companions and workers who show us
how to do it, giving us something to
aspire to.
17 I want you to know how delighted I
am to have Stephanas, Fortunatus, and
Achaicus here with me. They par ally
make up for your absence!
18 They've refreshed me by keeping me
in touch with you. Be proud that you
have people like this among you.
19 The churches here in western Asia
send gree ngs. Aquila, Priscilla, and the
church that meets in their house say
hello.
20 All the friends here say hello. Pass the
gree ngs around with holy embraces!1 CORINTHIANS 16
21 And I, Paul--in my own handwri
91
ng!-
-send you my regards.
22 If anyone won't love the Master,
throw him out. Make room for the
Master!
23 Our Master Jesus has his arms wide
open for you.
24 And I love all of you in the Messiah,
in Jesus.2 Corinthians
1
1 I, Paul, have been sent on a special
mission by the Messiah, Jesus,
planned by God himself. I write this to
God's congrega on in Corinth, and to
believers all over Achaia province.
2 May all the gi s and beneﬁts that
come from God our Father and the
Master, Jesus Christ, be yours! Timothy,
someone you know and trust, joins me
in this gree ng.
3 All praise to the God and Father of our
Master, Jesus the Messiah! Father of all
mercy! God of all healing counsel!
4 He comes alongside us when we go
through hard mes, and before you
know it, he brings us alongside someone
else who is going through hard mes so2 CORINTHIANS 1
2
that we can be there for that person just
as God was there for us.
5 We have plenty of hard mes that
come from following the Messiah, but
no more so than the good mes of his
healing comfort--we get a full measure
of that, too.
6 When we suﬀer for Jesus, it works
out for your healing and salva on. If we
are treated well, given a helping hand
and encouraging word, that also works
to your beneﬁt, spurring you on, face
forward, unﬂinching. Your hard mes are
also our hard mes.
7 When we see that you're just as
willing to endure the hard mes as to
enjoy the good mes, we know you're
going to make it, no doubt about it.
8 We don't want you in the dark,
friends, about how hard it was when all
this came down on us in Asia province.2 CORINTHIANS 1
3
It was so bad we didn't think we were
going to make it.
9 We felt like we'd been sent to death
row, that it was all over for us. As it
turned out, it was the best thing that
could have happened. Instead of trus ng
in our own strength or wits to get
out of it, we were forced to trust God
totally--not a bad idea since he's the God
who raises the dead!
10 And he did it, rescued us from certain
doom. [And] he'll do it again, rescuing us
as many mes as we need rescuing.
11 You and your prayers are part of the
rescue opera on--I don't want you in
the dark about that either. I can see your
faces even now, li ed in praise for God's
deliverance of us, a rescue in which your
prayers played such a crucial part.
12 Now that the worst is over, we're
pleased we can report that we've come
out of this with conscience and faith2 CORINTHIANS 1
4
intact, and can face the world--and
even more importantly, face you with
our heads held high. But it wasn't by
any fancy footwork on our part. It was
[God] who kept us focused on him,
uncompromised.
13 Don't try to read between the lines
or look for hidden meanings in this le er.
We're wri ng plain, unembellished
truth, hoping that
14 you'll now see the whole picture as
well as you've seen some of the details.
We want you to be as proud of us as
we are of you when we stand together
before our Master Jesus.
15 Conﬁdent of your welcome, I had
originally planned two great visits with
you--
16 coming by on my way to Macedonia
province, and then again on my return
trip. Then we could have had a bon-2 CORINTHIANS 1
5
voyage party as you sent me oﬀ to Judea.
That was the plan.
17 Are you now going to accuse me of
being ﬂip with my promises because it
didn't work out? Do you think I talk out
of both sides of my mouth--a glib [yes]
one moment, a glib [no] the next?
18 Well, you're wrong. I try to be as true
to my word as God is to his. Our word to
you wasn't a careless yes canceled by an
indiﬀerent no. How could it be?
19 When Silas and Timothy and I
proclaimed the Son of God among you,
did you pick up on any yes-and-no,
on-again, oﬀ-again waﬄing? Wasn't it a
clean, strong Yes?
20 Whatever God has promised gets
stamped with the Yes of Jesus. In him,
this is what we preach and pray, the
great Amen, God's Yes and our Yes
together, gloriously evident.2 CORINTHIANS 1 – 2
6
21 God aﬃrms us, making us a sure
thing in Christ, pu ng his Yes within us.
22 By his Spirit he has stamped us with
his eternal pledge--a sure beginning of
what he is des ned to complete.
23 Now, are you ready for the real
reason I didn't visit you in Corinth? As
God is my witness, the only reason I
didn't come was to spare you pain. I
was being [considerate] of you, not
indiﬀerent, not manipula ve.
24 We're not in charge of how you
live out the faith, looking over your
shoulders, suspiciously cri cal. We're
partners, working alongside you, joyfully
expectant. I know that you stand by your
own faith, not by ours.
1 That's why I decided not to make
another visit that could only be
painful to both of us.
2 If by merely showing up I would
put you in an embarrassingly painful
22 CORINTHIANS 2
7
posi on, how would you then be free to
cheer and refresh me?
3 That was my reason for wri ng a le er
instead of coming--so I wouldn't have to
spend a miserable me disappoin ng
the very friends I had looked forward to
cheering me up. I was convinced at the
me I wrote it that what was best for me
was also best for you.
4 As it turned out, there was pain
enough just in wri ng that le er, more
tears than ink on the parchment. But I
didn't write it to cause pain; I wrote it so
you would know how much I care--oh,
more than care--[love] you!
5 Now, regarding the one who started
all this--the person in ques on who
caused all this pain--I want you to know
that I am not the one injured in this as
much as, with a few excep ons, all of
you. So I don't want to come down too
hard.2 CORINTHIANS 2
8
6 What the majority of you agreed to as
punishment is punishment enough.
7 Now is the me to forgive this man
and help him back on his feet. If all you
do is pour on the guilt, you could very
well drown him in it.
8 My counsel now is to pour on the
love.
9 The focus of my le er wasn't on
punishing the oﬀender but on ge ng
you to take responsibility for the health
of the church.
10 So if you forgive him, I forgive him.
Don't think I'm carrying around a list of
personal grudges. The fact is that I'm
joining in with [your] forgiveness, as
Christ is with us, guiding us.
11 A er all, we don't want to unwi ngly
give Satan an opening for yet more
mischief--we're not oblivious to his sly
ways!2 CORINTHIANS 2
9
12 When I arrived in Troas to proclaim
the Message of the Messiah, I found the
place wide open: God had opened the
door; all I had to do was walk through it.
13 But when I didn't ﬁnd Titus wai ng
for me with news of your condi on, I
couldn't relax. Worried about you, I le
and came on to Macedonia province
looking for Titus and a reassuring word
on you.
14 And I got it, thank God! In the
Messiah, in Christ, God leads us from
place to place in one perpetual victory
parade. Through us, he brings knowledge
of Christ. Everywhere we go, people
breathe in the exquisite fragrance.
15 Because of Christ, we give oﬀ a sweet
scent rising to God, which is recognized
by those on the way of salva on--an
aroma redolent with life.
16 But those on the way to destruc on
treat us more like the stench from2 CORINTHIANS 2 – 3
10
a ro ng corpse. This is a terriﬁc
responsibility. Is anyone competent to
take it on?
17 No--but at least we don't take God's
Word, water it down, and then take it to
the streets to sell it cheap. We stand in
Christ's presence when we speak; God
looks us in the face. We get what we say
straight from God and say it as honestly
as we can.
1 Does it sound like we're pa ng
ourselves on the back, insis ng on
our creden als, asser ng our authority?
Well, we're not. Neither do we need
le ers of endorsement, either to you or
from you.
2 You yourselves are all the
endorsement we need. Your very
lives are a le er that anyone can read by
just looking at you.
3 Christ himself wrote it--not with ink,
but with God's living Spirit; not chiseled
32 CORINTHIANS 3
11
into stone, but carved into human
lives--and we publish it.
4 We couldn't be more sure of ourselves
in this--that [you], wri en by Christ
himself for God, are our le er of
recommenda on.
5 We wouldn't think of wri ng this kind
of le er about ourselves. Only God can
write such a le er.
6 His le er authorizes us to help carry
out this new plan of ac on. The plan
wasn't wri en out with ink on paper,
with pages and pages of legal footnotes,
killing your spirit. It's wri en with Spirit
on spirit, his life on our lives!
7 The Government of Death, its
cons tu on chiseled on stone tablets,
had a dazzling inaugural. Moses' face as
he delivered the tablets was so bright
that day (even though it would fade soon
enough) that the people of Israel could2 CORINTHIANS 3
12
no more look right at him than stare into
the sun.
8 How much more dazzling, then, the
Government of Living Spirit?
9 If the Government of Condemna on
was impressive, how about this
Government of Aﬃrma on?
10 Bright as that old government was, it
would look downright dull alongside this
new one.
11 If that makeshi arrangement
impressed us, how much more this
brightly shining government installed for
eternity?
12 With that kind of hope to excite us,
nothing holds us back.
13 Unlike Moses, we have nothing to
hide. Everything is out in the open with
us. He wore a veil so the children of
Israel wouldn't no ce that the glory was
fading away--2 CORINTHIANS 3
14 and they [didn't] no
13
ce. They didn't
no ce it then and they don't no ce it
now, don't no ce that there's nothing
le behind that veil.
15 Even today when the proclama ons
of that old, bankrupt government are
read out, they can't see through it. Only
Christ can get rid of the veil so they can
see for themselves that there's nothing
there.
16 Whenever, though, they turn to face
God as Moses did, God removes the veil
and there they are--face to face!
17 They suddenly recognize that God is
a living, personal presence, not a piece
of chiseled stone. And when God is
personally present, a living Spirit, that
old, constric ng legisla on is recognized
as obsolete. We're free of it!
18 All of us! Nothing between us
and God, our faces shining with the
brightness of his face. And so we are2 CORINTHIANS 4
14
transﬁgured much like the Messiah, our
lives gradually becoming brighter and
more beau ful as God enters our lives
and we become like him.
1 Since God has so generously let
us in on what he is doing, we're not
about to throw up our hands and walk
oﬀ the job just because we run into
occasional hard mes.
2 We refuse to wear masks and
play games. We don't maneuver and
manipulate behind the scenes. And we
don't twist God's Word to suit ourselves.
Rather, we keep everything we do and
say out in the open, the whole truth
on display, so that those who want to
can see and judge for themselves in the
presence of God.
3 If our Message is obscure to anyone,
it's not because we're holding back
in any way. No, it's because these
other people are looking or going the
42 CORINTHIANS 4
15
wrong way and refuse to give it serious
a en on.
4 All they have eyes for is the
fashionable god of darkness. They think
he can give them what they want,
and that they won't have to bother
believing a Truth they can't see. They're
stone-blind to the dayspring brightness
of the Message that shines with Christ,
who gives us the best picture of God
we'll ever get.
5 Remember, our Message is not
about ourselves; we're proclaiming
Jesus Christ, the Master. All we are is
messengers, errand runners from Jesus
for you.
6 It started when God said, "Light up
the darkness!" and our lives ﬁlled up
with light as we saw and understood
God in the face of Christ, all bright and
beau ful.2 CORINTHIANS 4
16
7 If you only look at us, you might
well miss the brightness. We carry
this precious Message around in the
unadorned clay pots of our ordinary
lives. That's to prevent anyone from
confusing God's incomparable power
with us.
8 As it is, there's not much chance
of that. You know for yourselves that
we're not much to look at. We've been
surrounded and ba ered by troubles,
but we're not demoralized; we're not
sure what to do,
9 but we know that God knows what
to do; we've been spiritually terrorized,
but God hasn't le our side; we've been
thrown down, but we haven't broken.
10 What they did to Jesus, they do
to us--trial and torture, mockery and
murder; what Jesus did among them, he
does in us--he lives!2 CORINTHIANS 4
17
11 Our lives are at constant risk for
Jesus' sake, which makes Jesus' life all
the more evident in us.
12 While we're going through the worst,
you're ge ng in on the best!
13 We're not keeping this quiet, not
on your life. Just like the psalmist who
wrote, "I believed it, so I said it," we say
what we believe.
14 And what we believe is that the One
who raised up the Master Jesus will just
as certainly raise us up with you, alive.
15 Every detail works to your advantage
and to God's glory: more and more
grace, more and more people, more and
more praise!
16 So we're not giving up. How could
we! Even though on the outside it o en
looks like things are falling apart on
us, on the inside, where God is making
new life, not a day goes by without his
unfolding grace.2 CORINTHIANS 4 – 5
17 These hard
18
mes are small potatoes
compared to the coming good mes, the
lavish celebra on prepared for us.
18 There's far more here than meets
the eye. The things we see now are here
today, gone tomorrow. But the things we
can't see now will last forever.
1 For instance, we know that when
these bodies of ours are taken down
like tents and folded away, they will
be replaced by resurrec on bodies in
heaven--God-made, not handmade
2 --and we'll never have to relocate our
"tents" again. Some mes we can hardly
wait to move--and so we cry out in
frustra on. Compared to what's coming,
living condi ons around here seem like
a stopover in an unfurnished shack, and
we're red of it! We've been given a
glimpse of the real thing, our true home,
our resurrec on bodies!
52 CORINTHIANS 5
5 The Spirit of God whets our appe
19
te
by giving us a taste of what's ahead. He
puts a li le of heaven in our hearts so
that we'll never se le for less.
6 That's why we live with such good
cheer. You won't see us drooping our
heads or dragging our feet! Cramped
condi ons here don't get us down. They
only remind us of the spacious living
condi ons ahead.
7 It's what we trust in but don't yet see
that keeps us going.
8 Do you suppose a few ruts in the
road or rocks in the path are going to
stop us? When the me comes, we'll
be plenty ready to exchange exile for
homecoming.
9 But neither exile nor homecoming is
the main thing. Cheerfully pleasing God
is the main thing, and that's what we
aim to do, regardless of our condi ons.2 CORINTHIANS 5
20
10 Sooner or later we'll all have to face
God, regardless of our condi ons. We
will appear before Christ and take what's
coming to us as a result of our ac ons,
either good or bad.
11 [That] keeps us vigilant, you can be
sure. It's no light thing to know that
we'll all one day stand in that place of
Judgment. That's why we work urgently
with everyone we meet to get them
ready to face God. God alone knows how
well we do this, but I hope you realize
how much and deeply we care.
12 We're not saying this to make
ourselves look good to you. We just
thought it would make you feel good,
proud even, that we're on your side and
not just nice to your face as so many
people are.
13 If I acted crazy, I did it for God; if I
acted overly serious, I did it for you.2 CORINTHIANS 5
21
14 Christ's love has moved me to such
extremes. His love has the ﬁrst and last
word in everything we do. Our ﬁrm
decision is to work from this focused
center: One man died for everyone. That
puts everyone in the same boat.
15 He included everyone in his death so
that everyone could also be included in
his life, a resurrec on life, a far be er
life than people ever lived on their own.
16 Because of this decision we don't
evaluate people by what they have or
how they look. We looked at the Messiah
that way once and got it all wrong, as
you know. We certainly don't look at him
that way anymore.
17 Now we look inside, and what we see
is that anyone united with the Messiah
gets a fresh start, is created new. The old
life is gone; a new life burgeons! Look at
it!2 CORINTHIANS 5 – 6
22
18 All this comes from the God who
se led the rela onship between us and
him, and then called us to se le our
rela onships with each other.
19 God put the world square with
himself through the Messiah, giving
the world a fresh start by oﬀering
forgiveness of sins. God has given us the
task of telling everyone what he is doing.
20 We're Christ's representa ves. God
uses us to persuade men and women
to drop their diﬀerences and enter
into God's work of making things right
between them. We're speaking for Christ
himself now: Become friends with God;
he's already a friend with you.
21 How? you say. In Christ. God put the
wrong on him who never did anything
wrong, so we could be put right with
God.
1 Companions as we are in this work
with you, we beg you, please don't
62 CORINTHIANS 6
23
squander one bit of this marvelous life
God has given us.
2 God reminds us, I heard your call in
the nick of me; The day you needed
me, I was there to help. Well, now is the
right me to listen, the day to be helped.
3 Don't put it oﬀ; don't frustrate God's
work by showing up late, throwing a
ques on mark over everything we're
doing.
4 Our work as God's servants gets
validated--or not--in the details. People
are watching us as we stay at our post,
alertly, unswervingly...in hard mes,
tough mes, bad mes;
5 when we're beaten up, jailed, and
mobbed; working hard, working late,
working without ea ng;
6 with pure heart, clear head, steady
hand; in gentleness, holiness, and honest
love;2 CORINTHIANS 6
24
7 when we're telling the truth, and
when God's showing his power; when
we're doing our best se ng things right;
8 when we're praised, and when we're
blamed; slandered, and honored; true to
our word, though distrusted;
9 ignored by the world, but recognized
by God; terriﬁcally alive, though rumored
to be dead; beaten within an inch of our
lives, but refusing to die;
10 immersed in tears, yet always ﬁlled
with deep joy; living on handouts, yet
enriching many; having nothing, having
it all.
11 Dear, dear Corinthians, I can't tell you
how much I long for you to enter this
wide-open, spacious life.
12 We didn't fence you in. The smallness
you feel comes from within you. Your
lives aren't small, but you're living them
in a small way.2 CORINTHIANS 6
25
13 I'm speaking as plainly as I can and
with great aﬀec on. Open up your lives.
Live openly and expansively!
14 Don't become partners with those
who reject God. How can you make a
partnership out of right and wrong?
That's not partnership; that's war. Is light
best friends with dark?
15 Does Christ go strolling with the
Devil? Do trust and mistrust hold hands?
16 Who would think of se ng up pagan
idols in God's holy Temple? But that is
exactly what we are, each of us a temple
in whom God lives. God himself put it
this way: "I'll live in them, move into
them; I'll be their God and they'll be my
people.
17 So leave the corrup on and
compromise; leave it for good," says
God. "Don't link up with those who will
pollute you. I want you all for myself.2 CORINTHIANS 6 – 7
26
18 I'll be a Father to you; you'll be sons
and daughters to me." The Word of the
Master, God.
1 With promises like this to pull us
on, dear friends, let's make a clean
break with everything that deﬁles or
distracts us, both within and without.
Let's make our en re lives ﬁt and holy
temples for the worship of God.
2 Trust us. We've never hurt a soul,
never exploited or taken advantage of
anyone.
3 Don't think I'm ﬁnding fault with you.
I told you earlier that I'm with you all the
way, no ma er what.
4 I have, in fact, the greatest conﬁdence
in you. If only you knew how proud I
am of you! I am overwhelmed with joy
despite all our troubles.
5 When we arrived in Macedonia
province, we couldn't se le down. The
ﬁghts in the church and the fears in our
72 CORINTHIANS 7
27
hearts kept us on pins and needles. We
couldn't relax because we didn't know
how it would turn out.
6 Then the God who li s up the
downcast li ed our heads and our hearts
with the arrival of Titus.
7 We were glad just to see him, but
the true reassurance came in what he
told us about you: how much you cared,
how much you grieved, how concerned
you were for me. I went from worry to
tranquility in no me!
8 I know I distressed you greatly with
my le er. Although I felt awful at the
me, I don't feel at all bad now that I see
how it turned out. The le er upset you,
but only for a while.
9 Now I'm glad--not that you were
upset, but that you were jarred into
turning things around. You let the
distress bring you to God, not drive you
from him. The result was all gain, no loss.2 CORINTHIANS 7
28
10 Distress that drives us to God does
that. It turns us around. It gets us back
in the way of salva on. We never regret
that kind of pain. But those who let
distress drive them away from God are
full of regrets, end up on a deathbed of
regrets.
11 And now, isn't it wonderful all the
ways in which this distress has goaded
you closer to God? You're more alive,
more concerned, more sensi ve, more
reverent, more human, more passionate,
more responsible. Looked at from any
angle, you've come out of this with
purity of heart.
12 And that is what I was hoping for in
the ﬁrst place when I wrote the le er.
My primary concern was not for the
one who did the wrong or even the one
wronged, but for you--that you would
realize and act upon the deep, deep es
between us before God.2 CORINTHIANS 7 – 8
29
13 That's what happened--and we felt
just great. And then, when we saw
how Titus felt--his exuberance over
your response--our joy doubled. It was
wonderful to see how revived and
refreshed he was by everything you did.
14 If I went out on a limb in telling Titus
how great I thought you were, you didn't
cut oﬀ that limb. As it turned out, I
hadn't exaggerated one bit. Titus saw for
himself that everything I had said about
you was true.
15 He can't quit talking about it, going
over again and again the story of your
prompt obedience, and the dignity and
sensi vity of your hospitality. He was
quite overwhelmed by it all!
16 And I couldn't be more pleased--I'm
so conﬁdent and proud of you.
1 Now, friends, I want to report on
the surprising and generous ways in
82 CORINTHIANS 8
30
which God is working in the churches in
Macedonia province.
2 Fierce troubles came down on the
people of those churches, pushing them
to the very limit. The trial exposed their
true colors: They were incredibly happy,
though desperately poor. The pressure
triggered something totally unexpected:
an outpouring of pure and generous
gi s.
3 I was there and saw it for myself.
They gave oﬀerings of whatever they
could--far more than they could aﬀord!--
4 pleading for the privilege of helping
out in the relief of poor Chris ans.
5 This was totally spontaneous, en rely
their own idea, and caught us completely
oﬀ guard. What explains it was that they
had ﬁrst given themselves unreservedly
to God and to us. The other giving simply
ﬂowed out of the purposes of God
working in their lives.2 CORINTHIANS 8
31
6 That's what prompted us to ask
Titus to bring the relief oﬀering to your
a en on, so that what was so well
begun could be ﬁnished up.
7 You do so well in so many things--you
trust God, you're ar culate, you're
insigh ul, you're passionate, you love
us--now, do your best in this, too.
8 I'm not trying to order you around
against your will. But by bringing in the
Macedonians' enthusiasm as a s mulus
to your love, I am hoping to bring the
best out of you.
9 You are familiar with the generosity of
our Master, Jesus Christ. Rich as he was,
he gave it all away for us--in one stroke
he became poor and we became rich.
10 So here's what I think: The best thing
you can do right now is to ﬁnish what
you started last year and not let those
good inten ons grow stale.2 CORINTHIANS 8
32
11 Your heart's been in the right place
all along. You've got what it takes to
ﬁnish it up, so go to it.
12 Once the commitment is clear, you
do what you can, not what you can't.
The heart regulates the hands.
13 This isn't so others can take it easy
while you sweat it out. No, you're
shoulder to shoulder with them all the
way,
14 your surplus matching their deﬁcit,
their surplus matching your deﬁcit. In
the end you come out even.
15 As it is wri en, Nothing le over to
the one with the most, Nothing lacking
to the one with the least.
16 I thank God for giving Titus the same
devoted concern for you that I have.
17 He was most considerate of how we
felt, but his eagerness to go to you and
help out with this relief oﬀering is his
own idea.2 CORINTHIANS 8
33
18 We're sending a companion along
with him, someone very popular in
the churches for his preaching of the
Message.
19 But there's far more to him than
popularity. He's rock-solid trustworthy.
The churches handpicked him to go with
us as we travel about doing this work of
sharing God's gi s to honor God as well
as we can,
20 taking every precau on against
scandal. We don't want anyone
suspec ng us of taking one penny of this
money for ourselves.
21 We're being as careful in our
reputa on with the public as in our
reputa on with God.
22 That's why we're sending another
trusted friend along. He's proved his
dependability many mes over, and
carries on as energe cally as the day he
started. He's heard much about you, and2 CORINTHIANS 8 – 9
34
liked what he's heard--so much so that
he can't wait to get there.
23 I don't need to say anything further
about Titus. We've been close associates
in this work of serving you for a long
me. The brothers who travel with him
are delegates from churches, a real
credit to Christ.
24 Show them what you're made of, the
love I've been talking up in the churches.
Let them see it for themselves!
1 If I wrote any more on this relief
oﬀering for the poor Chris ans, I'd
be repea ng myself.
2 I know you're on board and ready
to go. I've been bragging about you all
through Macedonia province, telling
them, "Achaia province has been ready
to go on this since last year." Your
enthusiasm by now has spread to most
of them.
92 CORINTHIANS 9
35
3 Now I'm sending the brothers to make
sure you're ready, as I said you would be,
so my bragging won't turn out to be just
so much hot air.
4 If some Macedonians and I happened
to drop in on you and found you
weren't prepared, we'd all be pre y
red-faced--you and us--for ac ng so sure
of ourselves.
5 So to make sure there will be no
slipup, I've recruited these brothers as
an advance team to get you and your
promised oﬀering all ready before I get
there. I want you to have all the me
you need to make this oﬀering in your
own way. I don't want anything forced or
hurried at the last minute.
6 Remember: A s ngy planter gets a
s ngy crop; a lavish planter gets a lavish
crop.
7 I want each of you to take plenty
of me to think it over, and make up2 CORINTHIANS 9
36
your own mind what you will give. That
will protect you against sob stories and
arm-twis ng. God loves it when the
giver delights in the giving.
8 God can pour on the blessings in
astonishing ways so that you're ready for
anything and everything, more than just
ready to do what needs to be done.
9 As one psalmist puts it, He throws
cau on to the winds, giving to the needy
in reckless abandon. His right-living,
right-giving ways never run out, never
wear out.
10 This most generous God who gives
seed to the farmer that becomes bread
for your meals is more than extravagant
with you. He gives you something you
can then give away, which grows into
full-formed lives, robust in God,
11 wealthy in every way, so that you
can be generous in every way, producing
with us great praise to God.2 CORINTHIANS 9 – 10
37
12 Carrying out this social relief work
involves far more than helping meet
the bare needs of poor Chris ans. It
also produces abundant and boun ful
thanksgivings to God.
13 This relief oﬀering is a prod to live at
your very best, showing your gra tude
to God by being openly obedient to
the plain meaning of the Message of
Christ. You show your gra tude through
your generous oﬀerings to your needy
brothers and sisters, and really toward
everyone.
14 Meanwhile, moved by the
extravagance of God in your lives,
they'll respond by praying for you in
passionate intercession for whatever
you need.
15 Thank God for this gi , his gi . No
language can praise it enough!
1 And now a personal but most
urgent ma er; I write in the
102 CORINTHIANS 10
38
gentle but ﬁrm spirit of Christ. I hear
that I'm being painted as cringing and
wishy-washy when I'm with you, but
harsh and demanding when at a safe
distance wri ng le ers.
2 Please don't force me to take a hard
line when I'm present with you. Don't
think that I'll hesitate a single minute
to stand up to those who say I'm an
unprincipled opportunist. Then they'll
have to eat their words.
3 The world is unprincipled. It's dog-eat-
dog out there! The world doesn't ﬁght
fair. But we don't live or ﬁght our ba les
that way--never have and never will.
4 The tools of our trade aren't for
marke ng or manipula on, but they are
for demolishing that en re massively
corrupt culture.
5 We use our powerful God-tools for
smashing warped philosophies, tearing
down barriers erected against the truth2 CORINTHIANS 10
39
of God, ﬁ ng every loose thought and
emo on and impulse into the structure
of life shaped by Christ.
6 Our tools are ready at hand for
clearing the ground of every obstruc on
and building lives of obedience into
maturity.
7 You stare and stare at the obvious, but
you can't see the forest for the trees.
If you're looking for a clear example of
someone on Christ's side, why do you
so quickly cut me out? Believe me, I am
quite sure of my standing with Christ.
8 You may think I overstate the authority
he gave me, but I'm not backing oﬀ.
Every bit of my commitment is for the
purpose of building you up, a er all, not
tearing you down.
9 And what's this talk about me bullying
you with my le ers?2 CORINTHIANS 10
10 "His le
40
ers are brawny and potent,
but in person he's a weakling and
mumbles when he talks."
11 Such talk won't survive scru ny.
What we write when away, we do when
present. We're the exact same people,
absent or present, in le er or in person.
12 We're not, understand, pu ng
ourselves in a league with those who
boast that they're our superiors. We
wouldn't dare do that. But in all this
comparing and grading and compe ng,
they quite miss the point.
13 We aren't making outrageous claims
here. We're s cking to the limits of what
God has set for us. But there can be no
ques on that those limits reach to and
include you.
14 We're not moving into someone
else's "territory." We were already there
with you, weren't we? We were the ﬁrst
ones to get there with the Message of2 CORINTHIANS 10 – 11
41
Christ, right? So how can there be any
ques on of overstepping our bounds by
wri ng or visi ng you?
15 We're not barging in on the righ ul
work of others, interfering with their
ministries, demanding a place in the sun
with them. What we're hoping for is that
as your lives grow in faith, you'll play a
part within our expanding work.
16 And we'll all s ll be within the limits
God sets as we proclaim the Message in
countries beyond Corinth. But we have
no inten on of moving in on what others
have done and taking credit for it.
17 "If you want to claim credit, claim it
for God."
18 What you say about yourself means
nothing in God's work. It's what God says
about you that makes the diﬀerence.
1 Will you put up with a li le
foolish aside from me? Please,
just for a moment.
112 CORINTHIANS 11
42
2 The thing that has me so upset is
that I care about you so much--this is
the passion of God burning inside me!
I promised your hand in marriage to
Christ, presented you as a pure virgin to
her husband.
3 And now I'm afraid that exactly as
the Snake seduced Eve with his smooth
pa er, you are being lured away from
the simple purity of your love for Christ.
4 It seems that if someone shows up
preaching quite another Jesus than
we preached--diﬀerent spirit, diﬀerent
message--you put up with him quite
nicely.
5 But if you put up with these big-shot
"apostles," why can't you put up with
simple me? I'm as good as they are.
6 It's true that I don't have their
voice, haven't mastered that smooth
eloquence that impresses you so much.
But when I do open my mouth, I at least2 CORINTHIANS 11
43
know what I'm talking about. We haven't
kept anything back. We let you in on
everything.
7 I wonder, did I make a bad mistake
in proclaiming God's Message to you
without asking for something in return,
serving you free of charge so that you
wouldn't be inconvenienced by me?
8 It turns out that the other churches
paid my way so that you could have a
free ride.
9 Not once during the me I lived
among you did anyone have to li a
ﬁnger to help me out. My needs were
always supplied by the Chris ans from
Macedonia province. I was careful never
to be a burden to you, and I never will
be, you can count on it.
10 With Christ as my witness, it's a point
of honor with me, and I'm not going to
keep it quiet just to protect you from
what the neighbors will think.2 CORINTHIANS 11
44
11 It's not that I don't love you; God
knows I do.
12 I'm just trying to keep things open
and honest between us. And I'm not
changing my posi on on this. I'd die
before taking your money. I'm giving
nobody grounds for lumping me in with
those money-grubbing "preachers,"
vaun ng themselves as something
special.
13 They're a sorry bunch--pseudo-
apostles, lying preachers, crooked
workers--posing as Christ's agents but
sham to the core.
14 And no wonder! Satan does it all the
me, dressing up as a beau ful angel of
light.
15 So it shouldn't surprise us when his
servants masquerade as servants of God.
But they're not ge ng by with anything.
They'll pay for it in the end.2 CORINTHIANS 11
45
16 Let me come back to where I
started--and don't hold it against me if I
con nue to sound a li le foolish. Or if
you'd rather, just accept that I am a fool
and let me rant on a li le.
17 I didn't learn this kind of talk from
Christ.
18 Oh, no, it's a bad habit I picked up
from the three-ring preachers that are
so popular these days.
19 Since you sit there in the judgment
seat observing all these shenanigans,
you can aﬀord to humor an occasional
fool who happens along.
20 You have such admirable tolerance
for impostors who rob your freedom,
rip you oﬀ, steal you blind, put you
down--even slap your face!
21 I shouldn't admit it to you, but
our stomachs aren't strong enough to
tolerate that kind of stuﬀ. Since you
admire the egomaniacs of the pulpit so2 CORINTHIANS 11
46
much (remember, this is your old friend,
the fool, talking), let me try my hand at
it.
22 Do they brag of being Hebrews,
Israelites, the pure race of Abraham? I'm
their match.
23 Are they servants of Christ? I can
go them one be er. (I can't believe I'm
saying these things. It's crazy to talk
this way! But I started, and I'm going to
ﬁnish.) I've worked much harder, been
jailed more o en, beaten up more mes
than I can count, and at death's door
me a er me.
24 I've been ﬂogged ﬁve mes with the
Jews' thirty-nine lashes,
25 beaten by Roman rods three mes,
pummeled with rocks once. I've been
shipwrecked three mes, and immersed
in the open sea for a night and a day.
26 In hard traveling year in and year out,
I've had to ford rivers, fend oﬀ robbers,2 CORINTHIANS 11
47
struggle with friends, struggle with foes.
I've been at risk in the city, at risk in
the country, endangered by desert sun
and sea storm, and betrayed by those I
thought were my brothers.
27 I've known drudgery and hard labor,
many a long and lonely night without
sleep, many a missed meal, blasted by
the cold, naked to the weather.
28 And that's not the half of it, when
you throw in the daily pressures and
anxie es of all the churches.
29 When someone gets to the end of his
rope, I feel the despera on in my bones.
When someone is duped into sin, an
angry ﬁre burns in my gut.
30 If I have to "brag" about myself, I'll
brag about the humilia ons that make
me like Jesus.
31 The eternal and blessed God and
Father of our Master Jesus knows I'm
not lying.2 CORINTHIANS 11 – 12
32 Remember the
48
me I was in
Damascus and the governor of King
Aretas posted guards at the city gates to
arrest me?
33 I crawled through a window in the
wall, was let down in a basket, and had
to run for my life.
1 You've forced me to talk this
way, and I do it against my be er
judgment. But now that we're at it, I may
as well bring up the ma er of visions
and revela ons that God gave me.
2 For instance, I know a man who,
fourteen years ago, was seized by Christ
and swept in ecstasy to the heights of
heaven. I really don't know if this took
place in the body or out of it; only God
knows.
3 I also know that this man was hijacked
into paradise--again, whether in or out
of the body, I don't know; God knows.
122 CORINTHIANS 12
49
There he heard the unspeakable spoken,
but was forbidden to tell what he heard.
5 This is the man I want to talk about.
But about myself, I'm not saying another
word apart from the humilia ons.
6 If I had a mind to brag a li le, I could
probably do it without looking ridiculous,
and I'd s ll be speaking plain truth all
the way. But I'll spare you. I don't want
anyone imagining me as anything other
than the fool you'd encounter if you saw
me on the street or heard me talk.
7 Because of the extravagance of those
revela ons, and so I wouldn't get a big
head, I was given the gi of a handicap
to keep me in constant touch with my
limita ons. Satan's angel did his best to
get me down; what he in fact did was
push me to my knees. No danger then of
walking around high and mighty!2 CORINTHIANS 12
8 At ﬁrst I didn't think of it as a gi
50
, and
begged God to remove it. Three mes I
did that,
9 and then he told me, My grace is
enough; it's all you need. My strength
comes into its own in your weakness.
Once I heard that, I was glad to let it
happen. I quit focusing on the handicap
and began apprecia ng the gi . It was a
case of Christ's strength moving in on my
weakness.
10 Now I take limita ons in stride, and
with good cheer, these limita ons that
cut me down to size--abuse, accidents,
opposi on, bad breaks. I just let Christ
take over! And so the weaker I get, the
stronger I become.
11 Well, now I've done it! I've made
a complete fool of myself by going on
like this. But it's not all my fault; you
put me up to it. You should have been
doing this for me, s cking up for me and2 CORINTHIANS 12
51
commending me instead of making me
do it for myself. You know from personal
experience that even if I'm a nobody, a
nothing, I wasn't second-rate compared
to those big-shot apostles you're so
taken with.
12 All the signs that mark a true apostle
were in evidence while I was with you
through both good mes and bad: signs
of portent, signs of wonder, signs of
power.
13 Did you get less of me or of God
than any of the other churches? The
only thing you got less of was less
responsibility for my upkeep. Well, I'm
sorry. Forgive me for depriving you.
14 Everything is in readiness now for
this, my third visit to you. But don't
worry about it; you won't have to put
yourselves out. I'll be no more of a
bother to you this me than on the
other visits. I have no interest in what2 CORINTHIANS 12
52
you have--only in you. Children shouldn't
have to look out for their parents;
parents look out for the children.
15 I'd be most happy to empty my
pockets, even mortgage my life, for your
good. So how does it happen that the
more I love you, the less I'm loved?
16 And why is it that I keep coming
across these whiﬀs of gossip about how
my self-support was a front behind
which I worked an elaborate scam?
Where's the evidence?
17 Did I cheat or trick you through
anyone I sent?
18 I asked Titus to visit, and sent some
brothers along. Did they swindle you
out of anything? And haven't we always
been just as aboveboard, just as honest?
19 I hope you don't think that all along
we've been making our defense before
you, the jury. You're not the jury; God is
the jury--God revealed in Christ--and we2 CORINTHIANS 12 – 13
53
make our case before him. And we've
gone to all the trouble of suppor ng
ourselves so that we won't be in the way
or get in the way of your growing up.
20 I do admit that I have fears that
when I come you'll disappoint me and
I'll disappoint you, and in frustra on
with each other everything will fall
to pieces--quarrels, jealousy, ﬂaring
tempers, taking sides, angry words,
vicious rumors, swelled heads, and
general bedlam.
21 I don't look forward to a second
humilia on by God among you,
compounded by hot tears over that
crowd that keeps sinning over and over
in the same old ways, who refuse to
turn away from the pigsty of evil, sexual
disorder, and indecency in which they
wallow.
1 Well, this is my third visit coming
up. Remember the Scripture that
132 CORINTHIANS 13
54
says, "A ma er becomes clear a er two
or three witnesses give evidence"?
2 On my second visit I warned that
bunch that keeps sinning over and over
in the same old ways that when I came
back I wouldn't go easy on them. Now,
preparing for the third, I'm saying it
again from a distance. If you haven't
changed your ways by the me I get
there, look out.
3 You who have been demanding proof
that Christ speaks through me will get
more than you bargained for. You'll get
the full force of Christ, don't think you
won't.
4 He was sheer weakness and
humilia on when he was killed on the
Cross, but oh, he's alive now--in the
mighty power of God! We weren't
much to look at, either, when we were
humiliated among you, but when we2 CORINTHIANS 13
55
deal with you this next me, we'll be
alive in Christ, strengthened by God.
5 Test yourselves to make sure you are
solid in the faith. Don't dri along taking
everything for granted. Give yourselves
regular checkups. You need ﬁrsthand
evidence, not mere hearsay, that Jesus
Christ is in you. Test it out. If you fail the
test, do something about it.
6 I hope the test won't show that we
have failed.
7 But if it comes to that, we'd rather the
test showed our failure than yours.
8 We're roo ng for the truth to win out
in you.
9 We couldn't possibly do otherwise.
We don't just put up with our limita ons;
we celebrate them, and then go on to
celebrate every strength, every triumph
of the truth in you. We pray hard that it
will all come together in your lives.2 CORINTHIANS 13
10 I'm wri
56
ng this to you now so that
when I come I won't have to say another
word on the subject. The authority the
Master gave me is for pu ng people
together, not taking them apart. I want
to get on with it, and not have to spend
me on reprimands.
11 And that's about it, friends. Be
cheerful. Keep things in good repair.
Keep your spirits up. Think in harmony.
Be agreeable. Do all that, and the God of
love and peace will be with you for sure.
12 Greet one another with a holy
embrace.
13 All the brothers and sisters here say
hello.
14 The amazing grace of the Master,
Jesus Christ, the extravagant love of
God, the in mate friendship of the Holy
Spirit, be with all of you.Gala ans
1
1 I, Paul, and my companions in faith
here, send gree ngs to the Gala an
churches. My authority for wri ng to you
does not come from any popular vote of
the people, nor does it come through the
appointment of some human higher-up.
It comes directly from Jesus the Messiah
and God the Father, who raised him from
the dead. I'm God-commissioned.
3 So I greet you with the great words,
grace and peace!
4 We know the meaning of those words
because Jesus Christ rescued us from this
evil world we're in by oﬀering himself as
a sacriﬁce for our sins. God's plan is that
we all experience that rescue.
5 Glory to God forever! Oh, yes!GALATIANS 1
2
6 I can't believe your ﬁckleness--how
easily you have turned traitor to him
who called you by the grace of Christ by
embracing a variant message!
7 It is not a minor varia on, you know;
it is completely other, an alien message,
a no-message, a lie about God. Those
who are provoking this agita on among
you are turning the Message of Christ on
its head.
8 Let me be blunt: If one of us--even if
an angel from heaven!--were to preach
something other than what we preached
originally, let him be cursed.
9 I said it once; I'll say it again: If anyone,
regardless of reputa on or creden als,
preaches something other than what
you received originally, let him be
cursed.
10 Do you think I speak this strongly
in order to manipulate crowds? Or
curry favor with God? Or get popularGALATIANS 1
3
applause? If my goal was popularity, I
wouldn't bother being Christ's slave.
11 Know this--I am most empha c here,
friends--this great Message I delivered
to you is not mere human op mism.
12 I didn't receive it through the
tradi ons, and I wasn't taught it in
some school. I got it straight from God,
received the Message directly from Jesus
Christ.
13 I'm sure that you've heard the story
of my earlier life when I lived in the
Jewish way. In those days I went all
out in persecu ng God's church. I was
systema cally destroying it.
14 I was so enthusias c about the
tradi ons of my ancestors that I
advanced head and shoulders above my
peers in my career.
15 Even then God had designs on me.
Why, when I was s ll in my mother'sGALATIANS 1
4
womb he chose and called me out of
sheer generosity!
16 Now he has intervened and revealed
his Son to me so that I might joyfully tell
non-Jews about him. Immediately a er
my calling--without consul ng anyone
around me
17 and without going up to Jerusalem
to confer with those who were apostles
long before I was--I got away to Arabia.
Later I returned to Damascus,
18 but it was three years before I went
up to Jerusalem to compare stories with
Peter. I was there only ﬁ een days--but
what days they were!
19 Except for our Master's brother
James, I saw no other apostles.
20 (I'm telling you the absolute truth in
this.)
21 Then I began my ministry in the
regions of Syria and Cilicia.GALATIANS 1 – 2
22 A
5
er all that me and ac vity I
was s ll unknown by face among the
Chris an churches in Judea.
23 There was only this report: "That
man who once persecuted us is now
preaching the very message he used to
try to destroy."
24 Their response was to recognize and
worship God because of me!
1 Fourteen years a er that ﬁrst visit,
Barnabas and I went up to Jerusalem
and took Titus with us.
2 I went to clarify with them what
had been revealed to me. At that me
I placed before them exactly what I
was preaching to the non-Jews. I did
this in private with the leaders, those
held in esteem by the church, so that
our concern would not become a
controversial public issue, marred by
ethnic tensions, exposing my years of
2GALATIANS 2
6
work to denigra on and endangering my
present ministry.
3 Signiﬁcantly, Titus, non-Jewish
though he was, was not required to be
circumcised.
4 While we were in conference we were
inﬁltrated by spies pretending to be
Chris ans, who slipped in to ﬁnd out
just how free true Chris ans are. Their
ulterior mo ve was to reduce us to their
brand of servitude.
5 We didn't give them the me of day.
We were determined to preserve the
truth of the Message for you.
6 As for those who were considered
important in the church, their reputa on
doesn't concern me. God isn't impressed
with mere appearances, and neither am
I. And of course these leaders were able
to add nothing to the message I had
been preaching.GALATIANS 2
7
7 It was soon evident that God had
entrusted me with the same message
to the non-Jews as Peter had been
preaching to the Jews.
9 Recognizing that my calling had
been given by God, James, Peter, and
John--the pillars of the church--shook
hands with me and Barnabas, assigning
us to a ministry to the non-Jews, while
they con nued to be responsible for
reaching out to the Jews.
10 The only addi onal thing they asked
was that we remember the poor, and I
was already eager to do that.
11 Later, when Peter came to An och,
I had a face-to-face confronta on with
him because he was clearly out of line.
12 Here's the situa on. Earlier, before
certain persons had come from James,
Peter regularly ate with the non-Jews.
But when that conserva ve group came
from Jerusalem, he cau ously pulledGALATIANS 2
8
back and put as much distance as he
could manage between himself and his
non-Jewish friends. That's how fearful
he was of the conserva ve Jewish clique
that's been pushing the old system of
circumcision.
13 Unfortunately, the rest of the Jews
in the An och church joined in that
hypocrisy so that even Barnabas was
swept along in the charade.
14 But when I saw that they were not
maintaining a steady, straight course
according to the Message, I spoke up
to Peter in front of them all: "If you, a
Jew, live like a non-Jew when you're
not being observed by the watchdogs
from Jerusalem, what right do you
have to require non-Jews to conform to
Jewish customs just to make a favorable
impression on your old Jerusalem
cronies?"GALATIANS 2
9
15 We Jews know that we have no
advantage of birth over "non-Jewish
sinners."
16 We know very well that we are not
set right with God by rule-keeping but
only through personal faith in Jesus
Christ. How do we know? We tried
it--and we had the best system of rules
the world has ever seen! Convinced
that no human being can please God
by self-improvement, we believed in
Jesus as the Messiah so that we might
be set right before God by trus ng in the
Messiah, not by trying to be good.
17 Have some of you no ced that we
are not yet perfect? (No great surprise,
right?) And are you ready to make the
accusa on that since people like me,
who go through Christ in order to get
things right with God, aren't perfectly
virtuous, Christ must therefore be anGALATIANS 2
10
accessory to sin? The accusa on is
frivolous.
18 If I was "trying to be good," I would
be rebuilding the same old barn that
I tore down. I would be ac ng as a
charlatan.
19 What actually took place is this: I
tried keeping rules and working my head
oﬀ to please God, and it didn't work. So I
quit being a "law man" so that I could be
[God's] man.
20 Christ's life showed me how, and
enabled me to do it. I iden ﬁed myself
completely with him. Indeed, I have
been cruciﬁed with Christ. My ego is no
longer central. It is no longer important
that I appear righteous before you or
have your good opinion, and I am no
longer driven to impress God. Christ lives
in me. The life you see me living is not
"mine," but it is lived by faith in the SonGALATIANS 2 – 3
11
of God, who loved me and gave himself
for me.
21 I am not going to go back on that. Is
it not clear to you that to go back to that
old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion
would be an abandonment of everything
personal and free in my rela onship with
God? I refuse to do that, to repudiate
God's grace. If a living rela onship with
God could come by rule-keeping, then
Christ died unnecessarily.
1 You crazy Gala ans! Did someone
put a hex on you? Have you taken
leave of your senses? Something crazy
has happened, for it's obvious that you
no longer have the cruciﬁed Jesus in
clear focus in your lives. His sacriﬁce on
the Cross was certainly set before you
clearly enough.
2 Let me put this ques on to you:
How did your new life begin? Was it
by working your heads oﬀ to please
3GALATIANS 3
12
God? Or was it by responding to God's
Message to you?
3 Are you going to con nue this
craziness? For only crazy people would
think they could complete by their own
eﬀorts what was begun by God. If you
weren't smart enough or strong enough
to begin it, how do you suppose you
could perfect it?
4 Did you go through this whole painful
learning process for nothing? It is not yet
a total loss, but it certainly will be if you
keep this up!
5 Answer this ques on: Does the God
who lavishly provides you with his own
presence, his Holy Spirit, working things
in your lives you could never do for
yourselves, does he do these things
because of your strenuous moral striving
[or] because you trust him to do them in
you?GALATIANS 3
13
6 Don't these things happen among you
just as they happened with Abraham?
He believed God, and that act of belief
was turned into a life that was right with
God.
7 Is it not obvious to you that persons
who put their trust in Christ (not persons
who put their trust in the law!) are like
Abraham: children of faith?
8 It was all laid out beforehand in
Scripture that God would set things
right with non-Jews by [faith]. Scripture
an cipated this in the promise to
Abraham: "All na ons will be blessed in
you."
9 So those now who live by faith are
blessed along with Abraham, who lived
by faith--this is no new doctrine!
10 And that means that anyone
who tries to live by his own eﬀort,
independent of God, is doomed to
failure. Scripture backs this up: "U erlyGALATIANS 3
14
cursed is every person who fails to carry
out every detail wri en in the Book of
the law."
11 The obvious impossibility of carrying
out such a moral program should
make it plain that no one can sustain
a rela onship with God that way. The
person who lives in right rela onship
with God does it by embracing what God
arranges for him. Doing things for God is
the opposite of entering into what God
does for you. Habakkuk had it right: "The
person who believes God, is set right by
God--and that's the real life."
12 Rule-keeping does not naturally
evolve into living by faith, but only
perpetuates itself in more and more
rule-keeping, a fact observed in
Scripture: "The one who does these
things [[rule-keeping]] con nues to live
by them."GALATIANS 3
15
13 Christ redeemed us from that
self-defea ng, cursed life by absorbing
it completely into himself. Do you
remember the Scripture that says,
"Cursed is everyone who hangs on a
tree"? That is what happened when
Jesus was nailed to the Cross: He became
a curse, and at the same me dissolved
the curse.
14 And now, because of that, the air is
cleared and we can see that Abraham's
blessing is present and available for
non-Jews, too. We are [all] able to
receive God's life, his Spirit, in and with
us by believing--just the way Abraham
received it.
15 Friends, let me give you an example
from everyday aﬀairs of the free life I am
talking about. Once a person's will has
been ra ﬁed, no one else can annul it or
add to it.GALATIANS 3
16
16 Now, the promises were made to
Abraham and to his descendant. You will
observe that Scripture, in the careful
language of a legal document, does
not say "to descendants," referring
to everybody in general, but "to
your descendant" (the noun, note, is
singular), referring to Christ.
17 This is the way I interpret this: A will,
earlier ra ﬁed by God, is not annulled by
an addendum a ached 430 years later,
thereby nega ng the promise of the will.
18 No, this addendum, with its
instruc ons and regula ons, has nothing
to do with the promised inheritance in
the will. What is the point, then, of the
law, the a ached addendum? It was
a though ul addi on to the original
covenant promises made to Abraham.
19 The purpose of the law was to keep
a sinful people in the way of salva on
un l Christ (the descendant) came,GALATIANS 3
17
inheri ng the promises and distribu ng
them to us. Obviously this law was not
a ﬁrsthand encounter with God. It was
arranged by angelic messengers through
a middleman, Moses.
20 But if there is a middleman as there
was at Sinai, then the people are not
dealing directly with God, are they?
But the original promise is the [direct]
blessing of God, received by faith.
21 If such is the case, is the law, then,
an an -promise, a nega on of God's will
for us? Not at all. Its purpose was to
make obvious to everyone that we are,
in ourselves, out of right rela onship
with God, and therefore to show us the
fu lity of devising some religious system
for ge ng by our own eﬀorts what we
can only get by wai ng in faith for God
to complete his promise. For if any kind
of rule-keeping had power to create lifeGALATIANS 3
18
in us, we would certainly have go en it
by this me.
23 Un l the me when we were mature
enough to respond freely in faith to the
living God, we were carefully surrounded
and protected by the Mosaic law.
24 The law was like those Greek tutors,
with which you are familiar, who escort
children to school and protect them
from danger or distrac on, making sure
the children will really get to the place
they set out for.
25 But now you have arrived at your
des na on:
26 By faith in Christ you are in direct
rela onship with God.
27 Your bap sm in Christ was not just
washing you up for a fresh start. It also
involved dressing you in an adult faith
wardrobe--Christ's life, the fulﬁllment of
God's original promise.GALATIANS 3 – 4
19
28 In Christ's family there can be no
division into Jew and non-Jew, slave and
free, male and female. Among us you are
all equal. That is, we are all in a common
rela onship with Jesus Christ.
29 Also, since you are Christ's family,
then you are Abraham's famous
"descendant," heirs according to the
covenant promises.
1 Let me show you the implica ons of
this. As long as the heir is a minor, he
has no advantage over the slave. Though
legally he owns the en re inheritance,
2 he is subject to tutors and
administrators un l whatever date
the father has set for emancipa on.
3 That is the way it is with us: When we
were minors, we were just like slaves
ordered around by simple instruc ons
(the tutors and administrators of this
world), with no say in the conduct of our
own lives.
4GALATIANS 4
4 But when the
20
me arrived that was
set by God the Father, God sent his
Son, born among us of a woman, born
under the condi ons of the law so that
he might redeem those of us who have
been kidnapped by the law.
5 Thus we have been set free to
experience our righ ul heritage.
6 You can tell for sure that you are
now fully adopted as his own children
because God sent the Spirit of his Son
into our lives crying out, "Papa! Father!"
7 Doesn't that privilege of in mate
conversa on with God make it plain that
you are not a slave, but a child? And if
you are a child, you're also an heir, with
complete access to the inheritance.
8 Earlier, before you knew God
personally, you were enslaved to
so-called gods that had nothing of the
divine about them.GALATIANS 4
21
9 But now that you know the real God--
or rather since God knows you--how can
you possibly subject yourselves again to
those paper gers?
10 For that is exactly what you do when
you are in midated into scrupulously
observing all the tradi ons, taboos, and
supers ons associated with special
days and seasons and years.
11 I am afraid that all my hard work
among you has gone up in a puﬀ of
smoke!
12 My dear friends, what I would really
like you to do is try to put yourselves in
my shoes to the same extent that I, when
I was with you, put myself in yours. You
were very sensi ve and kind then. You
did not come down on me personally.
13 You were well aware that the reason
I ended up preaching to you was that I
was physically broken, and so, prevented
from con nuing my journey, I was forcedGALATIANS 4
22
to stop with you. That is how I came to
preach to you.
14 And don't you remember that even
though taking in a sick guest was most
troublesome for you, you chose to treat
me as well as you would have treated an
angel of God--as well as you would have
treated Jesus himself if he had visited
you?
15 What has happened to the
sa sfac on you felt at that me? There
were some of you then who, if possible,
would have given your very eyes to
me--that is how deeply you cared!
16 And now have I suddenly become
your enemy simply by telling you the
truth? I can't believe it.
17 Those here cal teachers go to great
lengths to ﬂa er you, but their mo ves
are ro en. They want to shut you out
of the free world of God's grace so that
you will always depend on them forGALATIANS 4
23
approval and direc on, making them
feel important.
18 It is a good thing to be ardent in
doing good, but not just when I am in
your presence. Can't you con nue the
same concern for both my person and
my message when I am away from you
that you had when I was with you?
19 Do you know how I feel right now,
and will feel un l Christ's life becomes
visible in your lives? Like a mother in the
pain of childbirth.
20 Oh, I keep wishing that I was with
you. Then I wouldn't be reduced to this
blunt, le er-wri ng language out of
sheer frustra on.
21 Tell me now, you who have become
so enamored with the law: Have you
paid close a en on to that law?
22 Abraham, remember, had two sons:
one by the slave woman and one by the
free woman.GALATIANS 4
24
23 The son of the slave woman was born
by human connivance; the son of the
free woman was born by God's promise.
24 This illustrates the very thing
we are dealing with now. The two
births represent two ways of being
in rela onship with God. One is from
Mount Sinai in Arabia.
25 It corresponds with what is now
going on in Jerusalem--a slave life,
producing slaves as oﬀspring. This is the
way of Hagar.
26 In contrast to that, there is an
invisible Jerusalem, a free Jerusalem,
and she is our mother--this is the way of
Sarah.
27 Remember what Isaiah wrote:
Rejoice, barren woman who bears no
children, shout and cry out, woman who
has no birth pangs, Because the children
of the barren woman now surpass the
children of the chosen woman.GALATIANS 4 – 5
25
28 Isn't it clear, friends, that you, like
Isaac, are children of promise?
29 In the days of Hagar and Sarah,
the child who came from faithless
connivance (Ishmael) harassed the
child who came--empowered by the
Spirit--from the faithful promise (Isaac).
Isn't it clear that the harassment you are
now experiencing from the Jerusalem
here cs follows that old pa ern?
30 There is a Scripture that tells us what
to do: "Expel the slave mother with her
son, for the slave son will not inherit
with the free son."
31 Isn't that conclusive? We are not
children of the slave woman, but of the
free woman.
1 Christ has set us free to live a free
life. So take your stand! Never again
let anyone put a harness of slavery on
you.
5GALATIANS 5
2 I am empha
26
c about this. The moment
any one of you submits to circumcision
or any other rule-keeping system, at that
same moment Christ's hard-won gi of
freedom is squandered.
3 I repeat my warning: The person who
accepts the ways of circumcision trades
all the advantages of the free life in
Christ for the obliga ons of the slave life
of the law.
4 I suspect you would never intend this,
but this is what happens. When you
a empt to live by your own religious
plans and projects, you are cut oﬀ from
Christ, you fall out of grace.
5 Meanwhile we expectantly wait for a
sa sfying rela onship with the Spirit.
6 For in Christ, neither our most
conscien ous religion nor disregard of
religion amounts to anything. What
ma ers is something far more interior:
faith expressed in love.GALATIANS 5
27
7 You were running superbly! Who cut
in on you, deﬂec ng you from the true
course of obedience?
8 This detour doesn't come from the
One who called you into the race in the
ﬁrst place.
9 And please don't toss this oﬀ as
insigniﬁcant. It only takes a minute
amount of yeast, you know, to permeate
an en re loaf of bread.
10 Deep down, the Master has given me
conﬁdence that you will not defect. But
the one who is upse ng you, whoever
he is, will bear the divine judgment.
11 As for the rumor that I con nue to
preach the ways of circumcision (as I
did in those pre-Damascus Road days),
that is absurd. Why would I s ll be
persecuted, then? If I were preaching
that old message, no one would be
oﬀended if I men oned the Cross nowGALATIANS 5
28
and then--it would be so watered-down
it wouldn't ma er one way or the other.
12 Why don't these agitators, obsessive
as they are about circumcision, go all the
way and castrate themselves!
13 It is absolutely clear that God has
called you to a free life. Just make sure
that you don't use this freedom as an
excuse to do whatever you want to do
and destroy your freedom. Rather, use
your freedom to serve one another in
love; that's how freedom grows.
14 For everything we know about God's
Word is summed up in a single sentence:
Love others as you love yourself. That's
an act of true freedom.
15 If you bite and ravage each other,
watch out--in no me at all you will be
annihila ng each other, and where will
your precious freedom be then?
16 My counsel is this: Live freely,
animated and mo vated by God's Spirit.GALATIANS 5
29
Then you won't feed the compulsions of
selﬁshness.
17 For there is a root of sinful self-
interest in us that is at odds with a
free spirit, just as the free spirit is
incompa ble with selﬁshness. These
two ways of life are an the cal, so that
you cannot live at mes one way and at
mes another way according to how you
feel on any given day.
18 Why don't you choose to be led
by the Spirit and so escape the erra c
compulsions of a law-dominated
existence?
19 It is obvious what kind of life develops
out of trying to get your own way all
the me: repe ve, loveless, cheap sex;
a s nking accumula on of mental and
emo onal garbage; frenzied and joyless
grabs for happiness;
20 trinket gods; magic-show religion;
paranoid loneliness; cu hroatGALATIANS 5
30
compe on; all-consuming-yet-never-
sa sﬁed wants; a brutal temper; an
impotence to love or be loved; divided
homes and divided lives; small-minded
and lopsided pursuits;
21 the vicious habit of depersonalizing
everyone into a rival; uncontrolled and
uncontrollable addic ons; ugly parodies
of community. I could go on. This isn't
the ﬁrst me I have warned you, you
know. If you use your freedom this way,
you will not inherit God's kingdom.
22 But what happens when we live
God's way? He brings gi s into our lives,
much the same way that fruit appears
in an orchard--things like aﬀec on for
others, exuberance about life, serenity.
We develop a willingness to s ck with
things, a sense of compassion in the
heart, and a convic on that a basic
holiness permeates things and people.GALATIANS 5
31
We ﬁnd ourselves involved in loyal
commitments,
23 not needing to force our way in life,
able to marshal and direct our energies
wisely. Legalism is helpless in bringing
this about; it only gets in the way.
24 Among those who belong to Christ,
everything connected with ge ng our
own way and mindlessly responding to
what everyone else calls necessi es is
killed oﬀ for good--cruciﬁed.
25 Since this is the kind of life we have
chosen, the life of the Spirit, let us make
sure that we do not just hold it as an
idea in our heads or a sen ment in our
hearts, but work out its implica ons in
every detail of our lives.
26 That means we will not compare
ourselves with each other as if one of
us were be er and another worse. We
have far more interes ng things to do
with our lives. Each of us is an original.GALATIANS 6
1 Live crea
32
vely, friends. If someone
falls into sin, forgivingly restore
him, saving your cri cal comments
for yourself. You might be needing
forgiveness before the day's out.
2 Stoop down and reach out to those
who are oppressed. Share their burdens,
and so complete Christ's law.
3 If you think you are too good for that,
you are badly deceived.
4 Make a careful explora on of who you
are and the work you have been given,
and then sink yourself into that. Don't be
impressed with yourself. Don't compare
yourself with others.
5 Each of you must take responsibility
for doing the crea ve best you can with
your own life.
6 Be very sure now, you who have been
trained to a self-suﬃcient maturity, that
you enter into a generous common
life with those who have trained you,
6GALATIANS 6
33
sharing all the good things that you have
and experience.
7 Don't be misled: No one makes a
fool of God. What a person plants, he
will harvest. The person who plants
selﬁshness, ignoring the needs of
others--ignoring God!--
8 harvests a crop of weeds. All he'll have
to show for his life is weeds! But the one
who plants in response to God, le ng
God's Spirit do the growth work in him,
harvests a crop of real life, eternal life.
9 So let's not allow ourselves to get
fa gued doing good. At the right me
we will harvest a good crop if we don't
give up, or quit.
10 Right now, therefore, every me
we get the chance, let us work for the
beneﬁt of all, star ng with the people
closest to us in the community of faith.
11 Now, in these last sentences, I want
to emphasize in the bold scrawls ofGALATIANS 6
34
my personal handwri ng the immense
importance of what I have wri en to
you.
12 These people who are a emp ng to
force the ways of circumcision on you
have only one mo ve: They want an easy
way to look good before others, lacking
the courage to live by a faith that shares
Christ's suﬀering and death. All their talk
about the law is gas.
13 They [themselves] don't keep the
law! And they are highly selec ve in the
laws they [do] observe. They only want
you to be circumcised so they can boast
of their success in recrui ng you to their
side. That is contemp ble!
14 For my part, I am going to boast
about nothing but the Cross of our
Master, Jesus Christ. Because of that
Cross, I have been cruciﬁed in rela on
to the world, set free from the s ﬂing
atmosphere of pleasing others andGALATIANS 6
35
ﬁ ng into the li le pa erns that they
dictate.
15 Can't you see the central issue in all
this? It is not what you and I do--submit
to circumcision, reject circumcision. It is
what [God] is doing, and he is crea ng
something totally new, a free life!
16 All who walk by this standard are the
true Israel of God--his chosen people.
Peace and mercy on them!
17 Quite frankly, I don't want to be
bothered anymore by these disputes.
I have far more important things to
do--the serious living of this faith. I bear
in my body scars from my service to
Jesus.
18 May what our Master Jesus Christ
gives freely be deeply and personally
yours, my friends. Oh, yes!Ephesians
1
1 I, Paul, am under God's plan as
an apostle, a special agent of Christ
Jesus, wri ng to you faithful Chris ans in
Ephesus.
2 I greet you with the grace and peace
poured into our lives by God our Father
and our Master, Jesus Christ.
3 How blessed is God! And what a
blessing he is! He's the Father of our
Master, Jesus Christ, and takes us to the
high places of blessing in him.
4 Long before he laid down earth's
founda ons, he had us in mind, had
se led on us as the focus of his love, to
be made whole and holy by his love.
5 Long, long ago he decided to adopt
us into his family through Jesus Christ.
(What pleasure he took in planning this!)EPHESIANS 1
2
6 He wanted us to enter into the
celebra on of his lavish gi -giving by the
hand of his beloved Son.
7 Because of the sacriﬁce of the
Messiah, his blood poured out on the
altar of the Cross, we're a free people-
-free of penal es and punishments
chalked up by all our misdeeds. And not
just barely free, either. [Abundantly]
free!
8 He thought of everything, provided
for everything we could possibly need,
9 le ng us in on the plans he took such
delight in making. He set it all out before
us in Christ,
10 a long-range plan in which everything
would be brought together and summed
up in him, everything in deepest heaven,
everything on planet earth.
11 It's in Christ that we ﬁnd out who
we are and what we are living for. Long
before we ﬁrst heard of Christ and gotEPHESIANS 1
3
our hopes up, he had his eye on us, had
designs on us for glorious living,
12 part of the overall purpose he is
working out in everything and everyone.
13 It's in Christ that you, once you heard
the truth and believed it (this Message
of your salva on), found yourselves
home free--signed, sealed, and delivered
by the Holy Spirit.
14 This signet from God is the ﬁrst
installment on what's coming, a
reminder that we'll get everything
God has planned for us, a praising and
glorious life.
15 That's why, when I heard of the
solid trust you have in the Master Jesus
and your outpouring of love to all the
Chris ans,
16 I couldn't stop thanking God for
you--every me I prayed, I'd think of you
and give thanks.EPHESIANS 1
4
17 But I do more than thank. I ask--ask
the God of our Master, Jesus Christ, the
God of glory--to make you intelligent and
discerning in knowing him personally,
18 your eyes focused and clear, so that
you can see exactly what it is he is calling
you to do, grasp the immensity of this
glorious way of life he has for Chris ans,
19 oh, the u er extravagance of his
work in us who trust him--endless
energy, boundless strength!
20 All this energy issues from Christ:
God raised him from death and set him
on a throne in deep heaven,
21 in charge of running the
universe, everything from galaxies
to governments, no name and no power
exempt from his rule. And not just for
the me being, but [forever].
22 He is in charge of it all, has the ﬁnal
word on everything. At the center of all
this, Christ rules the church.EPHESIANS 1 – 2
5
23 The church, you see, is not peripheral
to the world; the world is peripheral to
the church. The church is Christ's body,
in which he speaks and acts, by which he
ﬁlls everything with his presence.
1 It wasn't so long ago that you were
mired in that old stagnant life of sin.
2 You let the world, which doesn't
know the ﬁrst thing about living, tell
you how to live. You ﬁlled your lungs
with polluted unbelief, and then exhaled
disobedience.
3 We all did it, all of us doing what we
felt like doing, when we felt like doing it,
all of us in the same boat. It's a wonder
God didn't lose his temper and do away
with the whole lot of us.
4 Instead, immense in mercy and with
an incredible love,
5 he embraced us. He took our sin-dead
lives and made us alive in Christ. He did
all this on his own, with no help from us!
2EPHESIANS 2
6
6 Then he picked us up and set us down
in highest heaven in company with Jesus,
our Messiah.
7 Now God has us where he wants us,
with all the me in this world and the
next to shower grace and kindness upon
us in Christ Jesus.
8 Saving is all his idea, and all his work.
All we do is trust him enough to let him
do it. It's God's gi from start to ﬁnish!
9 We don't play the major role. If we
did, we'd probably go around bragging
that we'd done the whole thing!
10 No, we neither make nor save
ourselves. God does both the making
and saving. He creates each of us by
Christ Jesus to join him in the work he
does, the good work he has go en ready
for us to do, work we had be er be
doing.EPHESIANS 2
7
11 But don't take any of this for granted.
It was only yesterday that you outsiders
to God's ways
12 had no idea of any of this, didn't
know the ﬁrst thing about the way God
works, hadn't the faintest idea of Christ.
You knew nothing of that rich history of
God's covenants and promises in Israel,
hadn't a clue about what God was doing
in the world at large.
13 Now because of Christ--dying that
death, shedding that blood--you who
were once out of it altogether are in on
everything.
14 The Messiah has made things up
between us so that we're now together
on this, both non-Jewish outsiders
and Jewish insiders. He tore down the
wall we used to keep each other at a
distance.
15 He repealed the law code that had
become so clogged with ﬁne print andEPHESIANS 2
8
footnotes that it hindered more than it
helped. Then he started over. Instead of
con nuing with two groups of people
separated by centuries of animosity
and suspicion, he created a new kind of
human being, a fresh start for everybody.
16 Christ brought us together through
his death on the Cross. The Cross got us
to embrace, and that was the end of the
hos lity.
17 Christ came and preached peace to
you outsiders and peace to us insiders.
18 He treated us as equals, and so made
us equals. Through him we both share
the same Spirit and have equal access to
the Father.
19 That's plain enough, isn't it? You're
no longer wandering exiles. This
kingdom of faith is now your home
country. You're no longer strangers or
outsiders. You [belong] here, with as
much right to the name Chris an asEPHESIANS 2 – 3
9
anyone. God is building a home. He's
using us all--irrespec ve of how we got
here--in what he is building.
20 He used the apostles and prophets
for the founda on. Now he's using
you, ﬁ ng you in brick by brick, stone
by stone, with Christ Jesus as the
cornerstone
21 that holds all the parts together. We
see it taking shape day a er day--a holy
temple built by God,
22 all of us built into it, a temple in
which God is quite at home.
1 This is why I, Paul, am in jail for
Christ, having taken up the cause of
you outsiders, so-called.
2 I take it that you're familiar with
the part I was given in God's plan for
including everybody.
3 I got the inside story on this from God
himself, as I just wrote you in brief.
3EPHESIANS 3
10
4 As you read over what I have
wri en to you, you'll be able to see for
yourselves into the mystery of Christ.
5 None of our ancestors understood
this. Only in our me has it been made
clear by God's Spirit through his holy
apostles and prophets of this new order.
6 The mystery is that people who have
never heard of God and those who
have heard of him all their lives (what
I've been calling outsiders and insiders)
stand on the same ground before God.
They get the same oﬀer, same help,
same promises in Christ Jesus. The
Message is accessible and welcoming to
everyone, across the board.
7 This is my life work: helping people
understand and respond to this
Message. It came as a sheer gi to me,
a real surprise, God handling all the
details.EPHESIANS 3
8 When it came to presen
11
ng the
Message to people who had no
background in God's way, I was the
least qualiﬁed of any of the available
Chris ans. God saw to it that I was
equipped, but you can be sure that it had
nothing to do with my natural abili es.
And so here I am, preaching and wri ng
about things that are way over my head,
the inexhaus ble riches and generosity
of Christ.
9 My task is to bring out in the open and
make plain what God, who created all
this in the ﬁrst place, has been doing in
secret and behind the scenes all along.
10 Through Chris ans like yourselves
gathered in churches, this extraordinary
plan of God is becoming known and
talked about even among the angels!
11 All this is proceeding along lines
planned all along by God and then
executed in Christ Jesus.EPHESIANS 3
12
12 When we trust in him, we're free to
say whatever needs to be said, bold to
go wherever we need to go.
13 So don't let my present trouble on
your behalf get you down. Be proud!
14 My response is to get down on my
knees before the Father,
15 this magniﬁcent Father who parcels
out all heaven and earth.
16 I ask him to strengthen you by his
Spirit--not a brute strength but a glorious
inner strength--
17 that Christ will live in you as you open
the door and invite him in. And I ask him
that with both feet planted ﬁrmly on
love,
18 you'll be able to take in with all
Chris ans the extravagant dimensions of
Christ's love. Reach out and experience
the breadth! Test its length! Plumb the
depths! Rise to the heights!EPHESIANS 3 – 4
13
19 Live full lives, full in the fullness of
God.
20 God can do anything, you know--far
more than you could ever imagine or
guess or request in your wildest dreams!
He does it not by pushing us around but
by working within us, his Spirit deeply
and gently within us.
21 Glory to God in the church! Glory
to God in the Messiah, in Jesus! Glory
down all the genera ons! Glory through
all millennia! Oh, yes!
1 In light of all this, here's what I
want you to do. While I'm locked up
here, a prisoner for the Master, I want
you to get out there and walk--be er
yet, run!--on the road God called you
to travel. I don't want any of you si ng
around on your hands. I don't want
anyone strolling oﬀ, down some path
that goes nowhere.
4EPHESIANS 4
14
2 And mark that you do this with
humility and discipline--not in ﬁts and
starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves
out for each other in acts of love,
3 alert at no cing diﬀerences and quick
at mending fences.
4 You were all called to travel on the
same road and in the same direc on,
so stay together, both outwardly and
inwardly.
5 You have one Master, one faith, one
bap sm,
6 one God and Father of all, who rules
over all, works through all, and is present
in all. Everything you are and think and
do is permeated with Oneness.
7 But that doesn't mean you should all
look and speak and act the same. Out
of the generosity of Christ, each of us is
given his own gi .
8 The text for this is, He climbed the
high mountain, He captured the enemyEPHESIANS 4
15
and seized the booty, He handed it all
out in gi s to the people.
9 It's true, is it not, that the One who
climbed up also climbed down, down to
the valley of earth?
10 And the One who climbed down is
the One who climbed back up, up to
highest heaven. He handed out gi s
above and below, ﬁlled heaven with his
gi s,
11 ﬁlled earth with his gi s. He handed
out gi s of apostle, prophet, evangelist,
and pastor-teacher
12 to train Chris ans in skilled servant
work, working within Christ's body, the
church,
13 un l we're all moving rhythmically
and easily with each other, eﬃcient and
graceful in response to God's Son, fully
mature adults, fully developed within
and without, fully alive like Christ.EPHESIANS 4
16
14 No prolonged infancies among us,
please. We'll not tolerate babes in the
woods, small children who are an easy
mark for impostors.
15 God wants us to grow up, to know the
whole truth and tell it in love--like Christ
in everything. We take our lead from
Christ, who is the source of everything
we do.
16 He keeps us in step with each other.
His very breath and blood ﬂow through
us, nourishing us so that we will grow up
healthy in God, robust in love.
17 And so I insist--and God backs me up
on this--that there be no going along
with the crowd, the empty-headed,
mindless crowd.
18 They've refused for so long to deal
with God that they've lost touch not only
with God but with reality itself.
19 They can't think straight anymore.
Feeling no pain, they let themselves goEPHESIANS 4
17
in sexual obsession, addicted to every
sort of perversion.
20 But that's no life for you. You learned
Christ!
21 My assump on is that you have
paid careful a en on to him, been well
instructed in the truth precisely as we
have it in Jesus.
22 Since, then, we do not have the
excuse of ignorance, everything--and I
do mean everything--connected with
that old way of life has to go. It's ro en
through and through. Get rid of it! And
then take on an en rely new way of
life--a God-fashioned life,
23 a life renewed from the inside
24 and working itself into your conduct
as God accurately reproduces his
character in you.
25 What this adds up to, then, is this:
no more lies, no more pretense. Tell
your neighbor the truth. In Christ's bodyEPHESIANS 4
18
we're all connected to each other, a er
all. When you lie to others, you end up
lying to yourself.
26 Go ahead and be angry. You do well
to be angry--but don't use your anger as
fuel for revenge. And don't stay angry.
Don't go to bed angry.
27 Don't give the Devil that kind of
foothold in your life.
28 Did you used to make ends meet by
stealing? Well, no more! Get an honest
job so that you can help others who
can't work.
29 Watch the way you talk. Let nothing
foul or dirty come out of your mouth.
Say only what helps, each word a gi .
30 Don't grieve God. Don't break his
heart. His Holy Spirit, moving and
breathing in you, is the most in mate
part of your life, making you ﬁt for
himself. Don't take such a gi for
granted.EPHESIANS 4 – 5
31 Make a clean break with all cu
19
ng,
backbi ng, profane talk.
32 Be gentle with one another, sensi ve.
Forgive one another as quickly and
thoroughly as God in Christ forgave you.
1 Watch what God does, and then
you do it, like children who learn
proper behavior from their parents.
2 Mostly what God does is love you.
Keep company with him and learn a life
of love. Observe how Christ loved us. His
love was not cau ous but extravagant.
He didn't love in order to get something
from us but to give everything of himself
to us. Love like that.
3 Don't allow love to turn into lust,
se ng oﬀ a downhill slide into sexual
promiscuity, ﬁlthy prac ces, or bullying
greed.
4 Though some tongues just love the
taste of gossip, Chris ans have be er
uses for language than that. Don't talk
5EPHESIANS 5
20
dirty or silly. That kind of talk doesn't ﬁt
our style. Thanksgiving is our dialect.
5 You can be sure that using people or
religion or things just for what you can
get out of them--the usual varia ons
on idolatry--will get you nowhere, and
certainly nowhere near the kingdom of
Christ, the kingdom of God.
6 Don't let yourselves get taken in by
religious smooth talk. God gets furious
with people who are full of religious
sales talk but want nothing to do with
him.
7 Don't even hang around people like
that.
8 You groped your way through that
murk once, but no longer. You're out
in the open now. The bright light of
Christ makes your way plain. So no more
stumbling around. Get on with it!EPHESIANS 5
21
9 The good, the right, the true--these
are the ac ons appropriate for daylight
hours.
10 Figure out what will please Christ,
and then do it.
11 Don't waste your me on useless
work, mere busywork, the barren
pursuits of darkness. Expose these
things for the sham they are.
12 It's a scandal when people waste
their lives on things they must do in the
darkness where no one will see.
13 Rip the cover oﬀ those frauds and
see how a rac ve they look in the light
of Christ.
14 Wake up from your sleep, Climb out
of your coﬃns; Christ will show you the
light!
15 So watch your step. Use your head.
16 Make the most of every chance you
get. These are desperate mes!EPHESIANS 5
22
17 Don't live carelessly, unthinkingly.
Make sure you understand what the
Master wants.
18 Don't drink too much wine. That
cheapens your life. Drink the Spirit of
God, huge draughts of him.
19 Sing hymns instead of drinking songs!
Sing songs from your heart to Christ.
20 Sing praises over everything, any
excuse for a song to God the Father in
the name of our Master, Jesus Christ.
21 Out of respect for Christ, be
courteously reverent to one another.
22 Wives, understand and support
your husbands in ways that show your
support for Christ.
23 The husband provides leadership
to his wife the way Christ does to his
church, not by domineering but by
cherishing.
24 So just as the church submits to
Christ as he exercises such leadership,EPHESIANS 5
23
wives should likewise submit to their
husbands.
25 Husbands, go all out in your love for
your wives, exactly as Christ did for the
church--a love marked by giving, not
ge ng.
26 Christ's love makes the church whole.
His words evoke her beauty. Everything
he does and says is designed to bring the
best out of her,
27 dressing her in dazzling white silk,
radiant with holiness.
28 And that is how husbands ought to
love their wives. They're really doing
themselves a favor--since they're already
"one" in marriage.
29 No one abuses his own body, does
he? No, he feeds and pampers it. That's
how Christ treats us, the church,
30 since we are part of his body.EPHESIANS 5 – 6
24
31 And this is why a man leaves father
and mother and cherishes his wife. No
longer two, they become "one ﬂesh."
32 This is a huge mystery, and I don't
pretend to understand it all. What is
clearest to me is the way Christ treats
the church.
33 And this provides a good picture of
how each husband is to treat his wife,
loving himself in loving her, and how
each wife is to honor her husband.
1 Children, do what your parents tell
you. This is only right.
2 "Honor your father and mother" is the
ﬁrst commandment that has a promise
a ached to it, namely,
3 "so you will live well and have a long
life."
4 Fathers, don't exasperate your
children by coming down hard on them.
Take them by the hand and lead them in
the way of the Master.
6EPHESIANS 6
5 Servants, respec
25
ully obey your
earthly masters but always with an eye
to obeying the [real] master, Christ.
6 Don't just do what you have to do
to get by, but work hear ly, as Christ's
servants doing what God wants you to
do.
7 And work with a smile on your face,
always keeping in mind that no ma er
who happens to be giving the orders,
you're really serving God.
8 Good work will get you good pay from
the Master, regardless of whether you
are slave or free.
9 Masters, it's the same with you. No
abuse, please, and no threats. You
and your servants are both under the
same Master in heaven. He makes no
dis nc on between you and them.
10 And that about wraps it up. God is
strong, and he wants you strong.EPHESIANS 6
26
11 So take everything the Master has
set out for you, well-made weapons of
the best materials. And put them to
use so you will be able to stand up to
everything the Devil throws your way.
12 This is no a ernoon athle c contest
that we'll walk away from and forget
about in a couple of hours. This is for
keeps, a life-or-death ﬁght to the ﬁnish
against the Devil and all his angels.
13 Be prepared. You're up against far
more than you can handle on your own.
Take all the help you can get, every
weapon God has issued, so that when
it's all over but the shou ng you'll s ll be
on your feet.
14 Truth, righteousness,
15 peace,
16 faith,
17 and salva on are more than words.
Learn how to apply them. You'll needEPHESIANS 6
27
them throughout your life. God's Word
is an [indispensable] weapon.
18 In the same way, prayer is essen al
in this ongoing warfare. Pray hard and
long. Pray for your brothers and sisters.
Keep your eyes open. Keep each other's
spirits up so that no one falls behind or
drops out.
19 And don't forget to pray for me. Pray
that I'll know what to say and have the
courage to say it at the right me, telling
the mystery to one and all, the Message
that I,
20 jailbird preacher that I am, am
responsible for ge ng out.
21 Tychicus, my good friend here, will
tell you what I'm doing and how things
are going with me. He is certainly a
dependable servant of the Master!
22 I've sent him not only to tell you
about us but to cheer you on in your
faith.EPHESIANS 6
28
23 Good-bye, friends. Love mixed with
faith be yours from God the Father and
from the Master, Jesus Christ.
24 Pure grace and nothing but grace
be with all who love our Master, Jesus
Christ.Philippians
1
1 Paul and Timothy, both of us
commi ed servants of Christ Jesus,
write this le er to all the Chris ans in
Philippi, pastors and ministers included.
2 We greet you with the grace and
peace that comes from God our Father
and our Master, Jesus Christ.
3 Every me you cross my mind, I break
out in exclama ons of thanks to God.
4 Each exclama on is a trigger to prayer.
I ﬁnd myself praying for you with a glad
heart.
5 I am so pleased that you have
con nued on in this with us, believing
and proclaiming God's Message, from
the day you heard it right up to the
present.PHILIPPIANS 1
2
6 There has never been the slightest
doubt in my mind that the God who
started this great work in you would keep
at it and bring it to a ﬂourishing ﬁnish on
the very day Christ Jesus appears.
7 It's not at all fanciful for me to think
this way about you. My prayers and
hopes have deep roots in reality. You
have, a er all, stuck with me all the way
from the me I was thrown in jail, put on
trial, and came out of it in one piece. All
along you have experienced with me the
most generous help from God.
8 He knows how much I love and miss
you these days. Some mes I think I feel
as strongly about you as Christ does!
9 So this is my prayer: that your love
will ﬂourish and that you will not only
love much but well. Learn to love
appropriately. You need to use your head
and test your feelingsPHILIPPIANS 1
3
10 so that your love is sincere and
intelligent, not sen mental gush. Live a
lover's life, circumspect and exemplary,
a life Jesus will be proud of:
11 boun ful in fruits from the soul,
making Jesus Christ a rac ve to all,
ge ng everyone involved in the glory
and praise of God.
12 I want to report to you, friends, that
my imprisonment here has had the
opposite of its intended eﬀect. Instead
of being squelched, the Message has
actually prospered.
13 All the soldiers here, and everyone
else too, found out that I'm in jail
because of this Messiah. That piqued
their curiosity, and now they've learned
all about him.
14 Not only that, but most of the
Chris ans here have become far more
sure of themselves in the faith than ever,PHILIPPIANS 1
4
speaking out fearlessly about God, about
the Messiah.
15 It's true that some here preach Christ
because with me out of the way, they
think they'll step right into the spotlight.
But the others do it with the best heart
in the world.
16 One group is mo vated by pure love,
knowing that I am here defending the
Message, wan ng to help.
17 The others, now that I'm out of the
picture, are merely greedy, hoping to get
something out of it for themselves. Their
mo ves are bad. They see me as their
compe on, and so the worse it goes
for me, the be er--they think--for them.
18 So how am I to respond? I've
decided that I really don't care about
their mo ves, whether mixed, bad, or
indiﬀerent. Every me one of them
opens his mouth, Christ is proclaimed,PHILIPPIANS 1
5
so I just cheer them on! And I'm going to
keep that celebra on going
19 because I know how it's going to turn
out. Through your faithful prayers and
the generous response of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ, everything he wants to do
in and through me will be done.
20 I can hardly wait to con nue on my
course. I don't expect to be embarrassed
in the least. On the contrary, everything
happening to me in this jail only serves
to make Christ more accurately known,
regardless of whether I live or die. They
didn't shut me up; they gave me a pulpit!
21 Alive, I'm Christ's messenger; dead,
I'm his bounty. Life versus even more
life! I can't lose.
22 As long as I'm alive in this body, there
is good work for me to do. If I had to
choose right now, I hardly know which
I'd choose.PHILIPPIANS 1
6
23 Hard choice! The desire to break
camp here and be with Christ is
powerful. Some days I can think of
nothing be er.
24 But most days, because of what you
are going through, I am sure that it's
be er for me to s ck it out here.
25 So I plan to be around awhile,
companion to you as your growth and
joy in this life of trus ng God con nues.
26 You can start looking forward to a
great reunion when I come visit you
again. We'll be praising Christ, enjoying
each other.
27 Meanwhile, live in such a way that
you are a credit to the Message of Christ.
Let nothing in your conduct hang on
whether I come or not. Your conduct
must be the same whether I show up
to see things for myself or hear of it
from a distance. Stand united, singularPHILIPPIANS 1 – 2
7
in vision, contending for people's trust in
the Message, the good news,
28 not ﬂinching or dodging in the
slightest before the opposi on. Your
courage and unity will show them what
they're up against: defeat for them,
victory for you--and both because of
God.
29 There's far more to this life than
trus ng in Christ. There's also suﬀering
for him. And the suﬀering is as much a
gi as the trus ng.
30 You're involved in the same kind of
struggle you saw me go through, on
which you are now ge ng an updated
report in this le er.
1 If you've go en anything at all out
of following Christ, if his love has
made any diﬀerence in your life, if being
in a community of the Spirit means
anything to you, if you have a heart, if
you [care]--
2PHILIPPIANS 2
8
2 then do me a favor: Agree with each
other, love each other, be deep-spirited
friends.
3 Don't push your way to the front;
don't sweet-talk your way to the top.
Put yourself aside, and help others get
ahead.
4 Don't be obsessed with ge ng your
own advantage. Forget yourselves long
enough to lend a helping hand.
5 Think of yourselves the way Christ
Jesus thought of himself.
6 He had equal status with God but
didn't think so much of himself that he
had to cling to the advantages of that
status no ma er what.
7 Not at all. When the me came, he set
aside the privileges of deity and took on
the status of a slave, became [human]!
8 Having become human, he stayed
human. It was an incredibly humbling
process. He didn't claim specialPHILIPPIANS 2
9
privileges. Instead, he lived a selﬂess,
obedient life and then died a selﬂess,
obedient death--and the worst kind of
death at that: a cruciﬁxion.
9 Because of that obedience, God li ed
him high and honored him far beyond
anyone or anything, ever,
10 so that all created beings in heaven
and on earth--even those long ago dead
and buried--will bow in worship before
this Jesus Christ,
11 and call out in praise that he is the
Master of all, to the glorious honor of
God the Father.
12 What I'm ge ng at, friends, is that
you should simply keep on doing what
you've done from the beginning. When
I was living among you, you lived in
responsive obedience. Now that I'm
separated from you, keep it up. Be er
yet, redouble your eﬀorts. Be energe cPHILIPPIANS 2
10
in your life of salva on, reverent and
sensi ve before God.
13 That energy is [God's] energy, an
energy deep within you, God himself
willing and working at what will give him
the most pleasure.
14 Do everything readily and cheerfully-
-no bickering, no second-guessing
allowed!
15 Go out into the world uncorrupted,
a breath of fresh air in this squalid and
polluted society. Provide people with a
glimpse of good living and of the living
God. Carry the light-giving Message into
the night
16 so I'll have good cause to be proud of
you on the day that Christ returns. You'll
be living proof that I didn't go to all this
work for nothing.
17 Even if I am executed here and now,
I'll rejoice in being an element in thePHILIPPIANS 2
11
oﬀering of your faith that you make on
Christ's altar, a part of your rejoicing.
18 But turnabout's fair play--you must
join me in my rejoicing. Whatever you
do, don't feel sorry for me.
19 I plan (according to Jesus' plan) to
send Timothy to you very soon so he can
bring back all the news of you he can
gather. Oh, how that will do my heart
good!
20 I have no one quite like Timothy. He is
loyal, and genuinely concerned for you.
21 Most people around here are looking
out for themselves, with li le concern
for the things of Jesus.
22 But you know yourselves that
Timothy's the real thing. He's been a
devoted son to me as together we've
delivered the Message.
23 As soon as I see how things are going
to fall out for me here, I plan to send him
oﬀ.PHILIPPIANS 2
12
24 And then I'm hoping and praying to
be right on his heels.
25 But for right now, I'm dispatching
Epaphroditus, my good friend and
companion in my work. You sent him to
help me out; now I'm sending him to
help you out.
26 He has been wan ng in the worst
way to get back with you. Especially
since recovering from the illness you
heard about, he's been wan ng to get
back and reassure you that he is just
ﬁne.
27 He nearly died, as you know, but
God had mercy on him. And not only on
him--he had mercy on me, too. His death
would have been one huge grief piled on
top of all the others.
28 So you can see why I'm so delighted
to send him on to you. When you see
him again, hale and hearty, how you'll
rejoice and how relieved I'll be.PHILIPPIANS 2 – 3
13
29 Give him a grand welcome, a joyful
embrace! People like him deserve the
best you can give.
30 Remember the ministry to me
that you started but weren't able to
complete? Well, in the process of
ﬁnishing up that work, he put his life on
the line and nearly died doing it.
1 And that's about it, friends. Be glad
in God! I don't mind repea ng what I
have wri en in earlier le ers, and I hope
you don't mind hearing it again. Be er
safe than sorry--so here goes.
2 Steer clear of the barking dogs,
those religious busybodies, all bark
and no bite. All they're interested in is
appearances--knife-happy circumcisers,
I call them.
3 The [real] believers are the ones the
Spirit of God leads to work away at
this ministry, ﬁlling the air with Christ's
3PHILIPPIANS 3
14
praise as we do it. We couldn't carry this
oﬀ by our own eﬀorts, and we know it--
4 even though we can list what many
might think are impressive creden als.
You know my pedigree:
5 a legi mate birth, circumcised on the
eighth day; an Israelite from the elite
tribe of Benjamin; a strict and devout
adherent to God's law;
6 a ﬁery defender of the purity of my
religion, even to the point of persecu ng
Chris ans; a me culous observer of
everything set down in God's law Book.
7 The very creden als these people are
waving around as something special, I'm
tearing up and throwing out with the
trash--along with everything else I used
to take credit for. And why? Because of
Christ.
8 Yes, all the things I once thought
were so important are gone from my
life. Compared to the high privilegePHILIPPIANS 3
15
of knowing Christ Jesus as my Master,
ﬁrsthand, everything I once thought I
had going for me is insigniﬁcant--dog
dung. I've dumped it all in the trash so
that I could embrace Christ
9 and be embraced by him. I didn't
want some pe y, inferior brand of
righteousness that comes from keeping
a list of rules when I could get the
robust kind that comes from trus ng
Christ--[God's] righteousness.
10 I gave up all that inferior stuﬀ so I
could know Christ personally, experience
his resurrec on power, be a partner in
his suﬀering, and go all the way with him
to death itself.
11 If there was any way to get in on the
resurrec on from the dead, I wanted to
do it.
12 I'm not saying that I have this all
together, that I have it made. But I am
well on my way, reaching out for Christ,PHILIPPIANS 3
16
who has so wondrously reached out for
me.
13 Friends, don't get me wrong: By no
means do I count myself an expert in all
of this, but I've got my eye on the goal,
where God is beckoning us onward--to
Jesus.
14 I'm oﬀ and running, and I'm not
turning back.
15 So let's keep focused on that goal,
those of us who want everything God
has for us. If any of you have something
else in mind, something less than total
commitment, God will clear your blurred
vision--you'll see it yet!
16 Now that we're on the right track,
let's stay on it.
17 S ck with me, friends. Keep track of
those you see running this same course,
headed for this same goal.
18 There are many out there taking
other paths, choosing other goals, andPHILIPPIANS 3 – 4
17
trying to get you to go along with them.
I've warned you of them many mes;
sadly, I'm having to do it again. All they
want is easy street. They hate Christ's
Cross.
19 But easy street is a dead-end street.
Those who live there make their bellies
their gods; belches are their praise; all
they can think of is their appe tes.
20 But there's far more to life for us.
We're ci zens of high heaven! We're
wai ng the arrival of the Savior, the
Master, Jesus Christ,
21 who will transform our earthy bodies
into glorious bodies like his own. He'll
make us beau ful and whole with the
same powerful skill by which he is
pu ng everything as it should be, under
and around him.
1 My dear, dear friends! I love you
so much. I do want the very best for
you. You make me feel such joy, ﬁll me
4PHILIPPIANS 4
18
with such pride. Don't waver. Stay on
track, steady in God.
2 I urge Euodia and Syntyche to iron
out their diﬀerences and make up.
God doesn't want his children holding
grudges.
3 And, oh, yes, Syzygus, since you're
right there to help them work things out,
do your best with them. These women
worked for the Message hand in hand
with Clement and me, and with the
other veterans--worked as hard as any
of us. Remember, their names are also in
the book of life.
4 Celebrate God all day, every day. I
mean, [revel] in him!
5 Make it as clear as you can to all you
meet that you're on their side, working
with them and not against them. Help
them see that the Master is about to
arrive. He could show up any minute!PHILIPPIANS 4
19
6 Don't fret or worry. Instead of
worrying, pray. Let pe ons and praises
shape your worries into prayers, le ng
God know your concerns.
7 Before you know it, a sense of God's
wholeness, everything coming together
for good, will come and se le you down.
It's wonderful what happens when Christ
displaces worry at the center of your life.
8 Summing it all up, friends, I'd say
you'll do best by ﬁlling your minds
and medita ng on things true, noble,
reputable, authen c, compelling,
gracious--the best, not the worst; the
beau ful, not the ugly; things to praise,
not things to curse.
9 Put into prac ce what you learned
from me, what you heard and saw and
realized. Do that, and God, who makes
everything work together, will work you
into his most excellent harmonies.PHILIPPIANS 4
20
10 I'm glad in God, far happier than you
would ever guess--happy that you're
again showing such strong concern for
me. Not that you ever quit praying and
thinking about me. You just had no
chance to show it.
11 Actually, I don't have a sense of
needing anything personally. I've learned
by now to be quite content whatever my
circumstances.
12 I'm just as happy with li le as with
much, with much as with li le. I've found
the recipe for being happy whether full
or hungry, hands full or hands empty.
13 Whatever I have, wherever I am, I
can make it through anything in the One
who makes me who I am.
14 I don't mean that your help didn't
mean a lot to me--it did. It was a
beau ful thing that you came alongside
me in my troubles.PHILIPPIANS 4
21
15 You Philippians well know, and you
can be sure I'll never forget it, that when
I ﬁrst le Macedonia province, venturing
out with the Message, not one church
helped out in the give-and-take of this
work except you. You were the only one.
16 Even while I was in Thessalonica,
you helped out--and not only once, but
twice.
17 Not that I'm looking for handouts,
but I do want you to experience the
blessing that issues from generosity.
18 And now I have it all--and keep
ge ng more! The gi s you sent with
Epaphroditus were more than enough,
like a sweet-smelling sacriﬁce roas ng
on the altar, ﬁlling the air with fragrance,
pleasing God no end.
19 You can be sure that God will
take care of everything you need, his
generosity exceeding even yours in the
glory that pours from Jesus.PHILIPPIANS 4

20 Our God and Father abounds in glory
that just pours out into eternity. Yes.
21 Give our regards to every Chris an

to your future in heaven, kept taut by
hope. The Message is as true among
you today as when you ﬁrst heard it. It
doesn't diminish or weaken over me.
6 It's the same all over the world. The
Message bears fruit and gets larger and
stronger, just as it has in you. From the
very ﬁrst day you heard and recognized
the truth of what God is doing, you've
been hungry for more.
7 It's as vigorous in you now as when
you learned it from our friend and close
associate Epaphras. He is one reliable
worker for Christ! I could always depend
on him.
8 He's the one who told us how
thoroughly love had been worked into
your lives by the Spirit.
9 Be assured that from the ﬁrst day
we heard of you, we haven't stopped
praying for you, asking God to give
you wise minds and spirits a unedCOLOSSIANS 1

to his will, and so acquire a thorough
understanding of the ways in which God
works.
10 We pray that you'll live well for the
Master, making him proud of you as you
work hard in his orchard. As you learn
more and more how God works, you will
learn how to do your work.
11 We pray that you'll have the strength
to s ck it out over the long haul--not
the grim strength of gri ng your teeth
but the glory-strength God gives. It is
strength that endures the unendurable
and spills over into joy,
12 thanking the Father who makes us
strong enough to take part in everything
bright and beau ful that he has for us.
13 God rescued us from dead-end alleys
and dark dungeons. He's set us up in the
kingdom of the Son he loves so much,COLOSSIANS 1
4
14 the Son who got us out of the pit
we were in, got rid of the sins we were
doomed to keep repea ng.
15 We look at this Son and see the God
who cannot be seen. We look at this
Son and see God's original purpose in
everything created.
16 For everything, absolutely
everything, above and below, visible and
invisible, rank a er rank a er rank of
angels--[everything] got started in him
and ﬁnds its purpose in him.
17 He was there before any of it came
into existence and holds it all together
right up to this moment.
18 And when it comes to the church, he
organizes and holds it together, like a
head does a body. He was supreme in the
beginning and--leading the resurrec on
parade--he is supreme in the end. From
beginning to end he's there, towering far
above everything, everyone.COLOSSIANS 1
5
19 So spacious is he, so roomy, that
everything of God ﬁnds its proper place
in him without crowding.
20 Not only that, but all the broken and
dislocated pieces of the universe--people
and things, animals and atoms--get
properly ﬁxed and ﬁt together in vibrant
harmonies, all because of his death, his
blood that poured down from the Cross.
21 You yourselves are a case study of
what he does. At one me you all had
your backs turned to God, thinking
rebellious thoughts of him, giving him
trouble every chance you got.
22 But now, by giving himself completely
at the Cross, actually [dying] for you,
Christ brought you over to God's side
and put your lives together, whole and
holy in his presence.
23 You don't walk away from a gi like
that! You stay grounded and steady in
that bond of trust, constantly tunedCOLOSSIANS 1

in to the Message, careful not to be
distracted or diverted. There is no other
Message--just this one. Every creature
under heaven gets this same Message. I,
Paul, am a messenger of this Message.
24 I want you to know how glad I am
that it's me si ng here in this jail and
not you. There's a lot of suﬀering to be
entered into in this world--the kind of
suﬀering Christ takes on. I welcome the
chance to take my share in the church's
part of that suﬀering.
25 When I became a servant in this
church, I experienced this suﬀering as a
sheer gi , God's way of helping me serve
you, laying out the whole truth.
26 This mystery has been kept in the
dark for a long me, but now it's out in
the open.
27 God wanted everyone, not just
Jews, to know this rich and glorious
secret inside and out, regardless of theirCOLOSSIANS 1 – 2
7
background, regardless of their religious
standing. The mystery in a nutshell is just
this: Christ is in you, therefore you can
look forward to sharing in God's glory.
It's that simple. That is the substance of
our Message.
28 We preach [Christ], warning people
not to add to the Message. We teach in a
spirit of profound common sense so that
we can bring each person to maturity.
To be mature is to be basic. Christ! No
more, no less.
29 That's what I'm working so hard at
day a er day, year a er year, doing my
best with the energy God so generously
gives me.
1 I want you to realize that I con nue
to work as hard as I know how for
you, and also for the Chris ans over at
Laodicea. Not many of you have met me
face-to-face, but that doesn't make any
diﬀerence. Know that I'm on your side,
2COLOSSIANS 2
8
right alongside you. You're not in this
alone.
2 I want you woven into a tapestry of
love, in touch with everything there is to
know of God. Then you will have minds
conﬁdent and at rest, focused on Christ,
God's great mystery.
3 All the richest treasures of wisdom
and knowledge are embedded in that
mystery and nowhere else. And we've
been shown the mystery!
4 I'm telling you this because I don't
want anyone leading you oﬀ on some
wild-goose chase, a er other so-called
mysteries, or "the Secret."
5 I'm a long way oﬀ, true, and you may
never lay eyes on me, but believe me,
I'm on your side, right beside you. I am
delighted to hear of the careful and
orderly ways you conduct your aﬀairs,
and impressed with the solid substance
of your faith in Christ.COLOSSIANS 2
9
6 My counsel for you is simple and
straigh orward: Just go ahead with what
you've been given. You received Christ
Jesus, the Master; now [live] him.
7 You're deeply rooted in him. You're
well constructed upon him. You know
your way around the faith. Now do what
you've been taught. School's out; quit
studying the subject and start [living]
it! And let your living spill over into
thanksgiving.
8 Watch out for people who try
to dazzle you with big words and
intellectual double-talk. They want to
drag you oﬀ into endless arguments
that never amount to anything. They
spread their ideas through the empty
tradi ons of human beings and the
empty supers ons of spirit beings. But
that's not the way of Christ.
9 Everything of God gets expressed
in him, so you can see and hear himCOLOSSIANS 2
10
clearly. You don't need a telescope, a
microscope, or a horoscope to realize
the fullness of Christ, and the emp ness
of the universe without him.
10 When you come to him, that fullness
comes together for you, too. His power
extends over everything.
11 Entering into this fullness is not
something you ﬁgure out or achieve.
It's not a ma er of being circumcised or
keeping a long list of laws. No, you're
already [in]--insiders--not through
some secre ve ini a on rite but rather
through what Christ has already gone
through for you, destroying the power of
sin.
12 If it's an ini a on ritual you're
a er, you've already been through it
by submi ng to bap sm. Going under
the water was a burial of your old life;
coming up out of it was a resurrec on,COLOSSIANS 2
11
God raising you from the dead as he did
Christ.
13 When you were stuck in your old
sin-dead life, you were incapable of
responding to God. God brought you
alive--right along with Christ! Think of it!
All sins forgiven,
14 the slate wiped clean, that old arrest
warrant canceled and nailed to Christ's
Cross.
15 He stripped all the spiritual tyrants
in the universe of their sham authority
at the Cross and marched them naked
through the streets.
16 So don't put up with anyone
pressuring you in details of diet, worship
services, or holy days.
17 All those things are mere shadows
cast before what was to come; the
substance is Christ.
18 Don't tolerate people who try to
run your life, ordering you to bow andCOLOSSIANS 2
12
scrape, insis ng that you join their
obsession with angels and that you seek
out visions. They're a lot of hot air, that's
all they are.
19 They're completely out of touch
with the source of life, Christ, who puts
us together in one piece, whose very
breath and blood ﬂow through us. He
is the Head and we are the body. We
can grow up healthy in God only as he
nourishes us.
20 So, then, if with Christ you've put all
that preten ous and infan le religion
behind you, why do you let yourselves
be bullied by it?
21 "Don't touch this! Don't taste that!
Don't go near this!"
22 Do you think things that are here
today and gone tomorrow are worth
that kind of a en on?
23 Such things sound impressive if said
in a deep enough voice. They even giveCOLOSSIANS 3
13
the illusion of being pious and humble
and asce c. But they're just another way
of showing oﬀ, making yourselves look
important.
1 So if you're serious about living
this new resurrec on life with Christ,
[act] like it. Pursue the things over which
Christ presides.
2 Don't shuﬄe along, eyes to the
ground, absorbed with the things right
in front of you. Look up, and be alert to
what is going on around Christ--that's
where the ac on is. See things from his
perspec ve.
3 Your old life is dead. Your new life,
which is your [real] life--even though
invisible to spectators--is with Christ in
God. [He] is your life.
4 When Christ (your real life, remember)
shows up again on this earth, you'll show
up, too--the real you, the glorious you.
3COLOSSIANS 3
14
Meanwhile, be content with obscurity,
like Christ.
5 And that means killing oﬀ everything
connected with that way of death:
sexual promiscuity, impurity, lust, doing
whatever you feel like whenever you feel
like it, and grabbing whatever a racts
your fancy. That's a life shaped by things
and feelings instead of by God.
6 It's because of this kind of thing that
God is about to explode in anger.
7 It wasn't long ago that you were doing
all that stuﬀ and not knowing any be er.
8 But you know be er now, so make
sure it's all gone for good: bad temper,
irritability, meanness, profanity, dirty
talk.
9 Don't lie to one another. You're done
with that old life. It's like a ﬁlthy set of
ill-ﬁ ng clothes you've stripped oﬀ and
put in the ﬁre.COLOSSIANS 3
15
10 Now you're dressed in a new
wardrobe. Every item of your new way
of life is custom-made by the Creator,
with his label on it. All the old fashions
are now obsolete.
11 Words like Jewish and non-Jewish,
religious and irreligious, insider and
outsider, uncivilized and uncouth, slave
and free, mean nothing. From now on
everyone is deﬁned by Christ, everyone
is included in Christ.
12 So, chosen by God for this new life of
love, dress in the wardrobe God picked
out for you: compassion, kindness,
humility, quiet strength, discipline.
13 Be even-tempered, content with
second place, quick to forgive an oﬀense.
Forgive as quickly and completely as the
Master forgave you.
14 And regardless of what else you put
on, wear love. It's your basic, all-purpose
garment. Never be without it.COLOSSIANS 3
16
15 Let the peace of Christ keep you
in tune with each other, in step with
each other. None of this going oﬀ and
doing your own thing. And cul vate
thankfulness.
16 Let the Word of Christ--the Message-
-have the run of the house. Give it plenty
of room in your lives. Instruct and direct
one another using good common sense.
And sing, sing your hearts out to God!
17 Let every detail in your lives--words,
ac ons, whatever--be done in the name
of the Master, Jesus, thanking God the
Father every step of the way.
18 Wives, understand and support your
husbands by submi ng to them in ways
that honor the Master.
19 Husbands, go all out in love for your
wives. Don't take advantage of them.
20 Children, do what your parents tell
you. This delights the Master no end.COLOSSIANS 3 – 4
17
21 Parents, don't come down too hard
on your children or you'll crush their
spirits.
22 Servants, do what you're told by your
earthly masters. And don't just do the
minimum that will get you by. Do your
best.
23 Work from the heart for your real
Master, for God,
24 conﬁdent that you'll get paid in full
when you come into your inheritance.
Keep in mind always that the ul mate
Master you're serving is Christ.
25 The sullen servant who does shoddy
work will be held responsible. Being
Chris an doesn't cover up bad work.
1 And masters, treat your servants
considerately. Be fair with them.
Don't forget for a minute that you, too,
serve a Master--God in heaven.
2 Pray diligently. Stay alert, with your
eyes wide open in gra tude.
4COLOSSIANS 4
18
3 Don't forget to pray for us, that God
will open doors for telling the mystery of
Christ, even while I'm locked up in this
jail.
4 Pray that every me I open my mouth
I'll be able to make Christ plain as day to
them.
5 Use your heads as you live and work
among outsiders. Don't miss a trick.
Make the most of every opportunity.
6 Be gracious in your speech. The goal
is to bring out the best in others in a
conversa on, not put them down, not
cut them out.
7 My good friend Tychicus will tell you
all about me. He's a trusted minister and
companion in the service of the Master.
8 I've sent him to you so that you would
know how things are with us, and so he
could encourage you in your faith.
9 And I've sent Onesimus with him.
Onesimus is one of you, and has becomeCOLOSSIANS 4
19
such a trusted and dear brother!
Together they'll bring you up-to-date on
everything that has been going on here.
10 Aristarchus, who is in jail here with
me, sends gree ngs; also Mark, cousin
of Barnabas (you received a le er
regarding him; if he shows up, welcome
him);
11 and also Jesus, the one they call
Justus. These are the only ones le from
the old crowd who have stuck with me in
working for God's kingdom. Don't think
they haven't been a big help!
12 Epaphras, who is one of you, says
hello. What a trooper he has been!
He's been reless in his prayers for you,
praying that you'll stand ﬁrm, mature
and conﬁdent in everything God wants
you to do.
13 I've watched him closely, and can
report on how hard he has workedCOLOSSIANS 4
20
for you and for those in Laodicea and
Hierapolis.
14 Luke, good friend and physician, and
Demas both send gree ngs.
15 Say hello to our friends in Laodicea;
also to Nympha and the church that
meets in her house.
16 A er this le er has been read to you,
make sure it gets read also in Laodicea.
And get the le er that went to Laodicea
and have it read to you.
17 And, oh, yes, tell Archippus, "Do your
best in the job you received from the
Master. Do your very best."
18 I'm signing oﬀ in my own
handwri ng--Paul. Remember to
pray for me in this jail. Grace be with
you.1 Thessalonians
1
1 I, Paul, together here with Silas
and Timothy, send gree ngs to
the church at Thessalonica, Chris ans
assembled by God the Father and by
the Master, Jesus Christ. God's amazing
grace be with you! God's robust peace!
2 Every me we think of you, we thank
God for you. Day and night you're in our
prayers
3 as we call to mind your work of faith,
your labor of love, and your pa ence
of hope in following our Master, Jesus
Christ, before God our Father.
4 It is clear to us, friends, that God
not only loves you very much but also
has put his hand on you for something
special.1 THESSALONIANS 1
2
5 When the Message we preached
came to you, it wasn't just words.
Something happened in you. The Holy
Spirit put steel in your convic ons. You
paid careful a en on to the way we
lived among you,
6 and determined to live that way
yourselves. In imita ng us, you imitated
the Master. Although great trouble
accompanied the Word, you were
able to take great joy from the Holy
Spirit!--taking the trouble with the joy,
the joy with the trouble.
7 Do you know that all over the
provinces of both Macedonia and Achaia
believers look up to you?
8 The word has go en around. Your
lives are echoing the Master's Word, not
only in the provinces but all over the
place. The news of your faith in God is
out. We don't even have to say anything
anymore--[you're] the message!1 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
3
9 People come up and tell us how you
received us with open arms, how you
deserted the dead idols of your old life
so you could embrace and serve God,
the true God.
10 They marvel at how expectantly
you await the arrival of his Son, whom
he raised from the dead--Jesus, who
rescued us from certain doom.
1 So, friends, it's obvious that our
visit to you was no waste of me.
2 We had just been given rough
treatment in Philippi, as you know, but
that didn't slow us down. We were sure
of ourselves in God, and went right
ahead and said our piece, presen ng
God's Message to you, deﬁant of the
opposi on.
3 God tested us thoroughly to make
sure we were qualiﬁed to be trusted
with this Message.
21 THESSALONIANS 2
4
4 Be assured that when we speak to you
we're not a er crowd approval--only
God approval. Since we've been put
through that ba ery of tests, you're
guaranteed that both we and the
Message are free of error, mixed
mo ves, or hidden agendas.
5 We never used words to bu er you
up. No one knows that be er than you.
And God knows we never used words
as a smoke screen to take advantage of
you.
6 Even though we had some standing
as Christ's apostles, we never threw our
weight around or tried to come across as
important, with you or anyone else.
7 We weren't aloof with you. We took
you just as you were. We were never
patronizing, never condescending, but
we cared for you the way a mother cares
for her children.1 THESSALONIANS 2
5
8 We loved you dearly. Not content to
just pass on the Message, we wanted to
give you our hearts. And we [did].
9 You remember us in those days,
friends, working our ﬁngers to the bone,
up half the night, moonligh ng so you
wouldn't have the burden of suppor ng
us while we proclaimed God's Message
to you.
10 You saw with your own eyes how
discreet and courteous we were among
you, with keen sensi vity to you as
fellow believers. And God knows we
weren't freeloaders!
11 You experienced it all ﬁrsthand. With
each of you we were like a father with
his child,
12 holding your hand, whispering
encouragement, showing you step-by-
step how to live well before God, who
called us into his own kingdom, into this
deligh ul life.1 THESSALONIANS 2
6
13 And now we look back on all this and
thank God, an artesian well of thanks!
When you got the Message of God we
preached, you didn't pass it oﬀ as just
one more human opinion, but you took
it to heart as God's true word to you,
which it is, God himself at work in you
believers!
14 Friends, do you realize that you
followed in the exact footsteps of the
churches of God in Judea, those who
were the ﬁrst to follow in the footsteps
of Jesus Christ? You got the same bad
treatment from your countrymen as
they did from theirs, the Jews
15 who killed the Master Jesus (to say
nothing of the prophets) and followed
it up by running us out of town. They
make themselves oﬀensive to God and
everyone else
16 by trying to keep us from telling
people who've never heard of our1 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
7
God how to be saved. They've made a
career of opposing God, and have go en
mighty good at it. But God is fed up,
ready to put an end to it.
17 Do you have any idea how very
homesick we became for you, dear
friends? Even though it hadn't been
that long and it was only our bodies
that were separated from you, not our
hearts, we tried our very best to get back
to see you.
18 You can't imagine how much we
missed you! I, Paul, tried over and over
to get back, but Satan stymied us each
me.
19 Who do you think we're going to be
proud of when our Master Jesus appears
if it's not you?
20 You're our pride and joy!
1 So when we couldn't stand being
separated from you any longer and
31 THESSALONIANS 3
8
could ﬁnd no way to visit you ourselves,
we stayed in Athens
2 and sent Timothy to get you up and
about, cheering you on so you wouldn't
be discouraged by these hard mes. He's
a brother and companion in the faith,
God's man in spreading the Message,
preaching Christ.
3 Not that the troubles should come
as any surprise to you. You've always
known that we're in for this kind of
thing. It's part of our calling.
4 When we were with you, we made it
quite clear that there was trouble ahead.
And now that it's happened, you know
what it's like.
5 That's why I couldn't quit worrying; I
had to know for myself how you were
doing in the faith. I didn't want the
Tempter ge ng to you and tearing down
everything we had built up together.1 THESSALONIANS 3
9
6 But now that Timothy is back, bringing
this terriﬁc report on your faith and
love, we feel a lot be er. It's especially
gra fying to know that you con nue to
think well of us, and that you want to
see us as much as we want to see you!
7 In the middle of our trouble and hard
mes here, just knowing how you're
doing keeps us going.
8 Knowing that your faith is alive keeps
us alive.
9 What would be an adequate
thanksgiving to oﬀer God for all the joy
we experience before him because of
you?
10 We do what we can, praying away,
night and day, asking for the bonus of
seeing your faces again and doing what
we can to help when your faith falters.
11 May God our Father himself and our
Master Jesus clear the road to you!1 THESSALONIANS 3 – 4
10
12 And may the Master pour on the love
so it ﬁlls your lives and splashes over
on everyone around you, just as it does
from us to you.
13 May you be infused with strength
and purity, ﬁlled with conﬁdence in
the presence of God our Father when
our Master Jesus arrives with all his
followers.
1 One ﬁnal word, friends. We ask
you--urge is more like it--that you
keep on doing what we told you to do
to please God, not in a dogged religious
plod, but in a living, spirited dance.
2 You know the guidelines we laid out
for you from the Master Jesus.
3 God wants you to live a pure life. Keep
yourselves from sexual promiscuity.
4 Learn to appreciate and give dignity
to your body,
5 not abusing it, as is so common among
those who know nothing of God.
41 THESSALONIANS 4
11
6 Don't run roughshod over the
concerns of your brothers and sisters.
Their concerns are God's concerns,
and [he] will take care of them. We've
warned you about this before.
7 God hasn't invited us into a disorderly,
unkempt life but into something holy
and beau ful--as beau ful on the inside
as the outside.
8 If you disregard this advice, you're
not oﬀending your neighbors; you're
rejec ng God, who is making you a gi
of his Holy Spirit.
9 Regarding life together and ge ng
along with each other, you don't need
me to tell you what to do. You're
[God]-taught in these ma ers. Just love
one another!
10 You're already good at it; your friends
all over the province of Macedonia are
the evidence. Keep it up; get be er and
be er at it.1 THESSALONIANS 4
12
11 Stay calm; mind your own business;
do your own job. You've heard all this
from us before, but a reminder never
hurts.
12 We want you living in a way that will
command the respect of outsiders, not
lying around sponging oﬀ your friends.
13 And regarding the ques on, friends,
that has come up about what happens
to those already dead and buried, we
don't want you in the dark any longer.
First oﬀ, you must not carry on over
them like people who have nothing to
look forward to, as if the grave were the
last word.
14 Since Jesus died and broke loose
from the grave, God will most certainly
bring back to life those who died in
Jesus.
15 And then this: We can tell you with
complete conﬁdence--we have the
Master's word on it--that when the1 THESSALONIANS 4 – 5
13
Master comes again to get us, those of
us who are s ll alive will not get a jump
on the dead and leave them behind. In
actual fact, they'll be ahead of us.
16 The Master himself will give the
command. Archangel thunder! God's
trumpet blast! He'll come down from
heaven and the dead in Christ will
rise--they'll go ﬁrst.
17 Then the rest of us who are s ll alive
at the me will be caught up with them
into the clouds to meet the Master.
18 Oh, we'll be walking on air! And
then there will be one huge family
reunion with the Master. So reassure
one another with these words.
1 I don't think, friends, that I need to
deal with the ques on of when all
this is going to happen.
2 You know as well as I that the day of
the Master's coming can't be posted on
our calendars. He won't call ahead and
51 THESSALONIANS 5
14
make an appointment any more than a
burglar would.
3 About the me everybody's walking
around complacently, congratula ng
each other--"We've sure got it made!
Now we can take it easy!"--suddenly
everything will fall apart. It's going to
come as suddenly and inescapably as
birth pangs to a pregnant woman.
4 But friends, you're not in the dark, so
how could you be taken oﬀ guard by any
of this?
5 You're sons of Light, daughters of Day.
We live under wide open skies and know
where we stand.
6 So let's not sleepwalk through life like
those others. Let's keep our eyes open
and be smart.
7 People sleep at night and get drunk at
night.
8 But not us! Since we're creatures of
Day, let's act like it. Walk out into the1 THESSALONIANS 5
15
daylight sober, dressed up in faith, love,
and the hope of salva on.
9 God didn't set us up for an angry
rejec on but for salva on by our Master,
Jesus Christ.
10 He died for us, a death that triggered
life. Whether we're awake with the living
or asleep with the dead, we're alive with
him!
11 So speak encouraging words to one
another. Build up hope so you'll all be
together in this, no one le out, no one
le behind. I know you're already doing
this; just keep on doing it.
12 And now, friends, we ask you to
honor those leaders who work so hard
for you, who have been given the
responsibility of urging and guiding you
along in your obedience.
13 Overwhelm them with apprecia on
and love! Get along among yourselves,
each of you doing your part.1 THESSALONIANS 5
16
14 Our counsel is that you warn the
freeloaders to get a move on. Gently
encourage the stragglers, and reach
out for the exhausted, pulling them to
their feet. Be pa ent with each person,
a en ve to individual needs.
15 And be careful that when you get
on each other's nerves you don't snap
at each other. Look for the best in each
other, and always do your best to bring
it out.
16 Be cheerful no ma er what;
17 pray all the me;
18 thank God no ma er what happens.
This is the way God wants you who
belong to Christ Jesus to live.
19 Don't suppress the Spirit,
20 and don't s ﬂe those who have a
word from the Master.
21 On the other hand, don't be gullible.
Check out everything, and keep only
what's good.1 THESSALONIANS 5
17
22 Throw out anything tainted with evil.
23 May God himself, the God who makes
everything holy and whole, make you
holy and whole, put you together--spirit,
soul, and body--and keep you ﬁt for the
coming of our Master, Jesus Christ.
24 The One who called you is completely
dependable. If he said it, he'll do it!
25 Friends, keep up your prayers for us.
26 Greet all the Chris ans there with a
holy embrace.
27 And make sure this le er gets read to
all the brothers and sisters. Don't leave
anyone out.
28 The amazing grace of Jesus Christ be
with you!2 Thessalonians
1
1 I, Paul, together with Silas and
Timothy, greet the church of the
Thessalonian Chris ans in the name of
God our Father and our Master, Jesus
Christ.
2 Our God gives you everything you
need, makes you everything you're to
be.
3 You need to know, friends, that
thanking God over and over for you
is not only a pleasure; it's a must. We
[have] to do it. Your faith is growing
phenomenally; your love for each other
is developing wonderfully. Why, it's only
right that we give thanks.
4 We're so proud of you; you're so
steady and determined in your faith
despite all the hard mes that have2 THESSALONIANS 1
2
come down on you. We tell everyone we
meet in the churches all about you.
5 All this trouble is a clear sign that
God has decided to make you ﬁt for the
kingdom. You're suﬀering now,
6 but jus ce is on the way. When the
Master Jesus appears out of heaven in a
blaze of ﬁre with his strong angels, he'll
even up the score by se ling accounts
with those who gave you such a bad
me.
7 His coming will be the break we've
been wai ng for.
8 Those who refuse to know God and
refuse to obey the Message will pay for
what they've done.
9 Eternal exile from the presence of the
Master and his splendid power is their
sentence.
10 But on that very same day when he
comes, he will be exalted by his followers
and celebrated by all who believe--and2 THESSALONIANS 1 – 2
3
all because you believed what we told
you.
11 Because we know that this
extraordinary day is just ahead, we pray
for you all the me--pray that our God
will make you ﬁt for what he's called you
to be, pray that he'll ﬁll your good ideas
and acts of faith with his own energy so
that it all amounts to something.
12 If your life honors the name of Jesus,
he will honor you. Grace is behind
and through all of this, our God giving
himself freely, the Master, Jesus Christ,
giving himself freely.
1 Now, friends, read these next words
carefully. Slow down and don't go
jumping to conclusions regarding the
day when our Master, Jesus Christ, will
come back and we assemble to welcome
him.
2 Don't let anyone shake you up or get
you excited over some breathless report
22 THESSALONIANS 2
4
or rumored le er from me that the day
of the Master's arrival has come and
gone.
3 Don't fall for any line like that. Before
that day comes, a couple of things have
to happen. First, the Apostasy. Second,
the debut of the Anarchist, a real dog of
Satan.
4 He'll defy and then take over every
so-called god or altar. Having cleared
away the opposi on, he'll then set
himself up in God's Temple as "God
Almighty."
5 Don't you remember me going over
all this in detail when I was with you?
Are your memories that short?
6 You'll also remember that I told you
the Anarchist is being held back un l just
the right me.
7 That doesn't mean that the spirit of
anarchy is not now at work. It is, secretly
and underground.2 THESSALONIANS 2
8 But the
5
me will come when the
Anarchist will no longer be held back,
but will be let loose. But don't worry. The
Master Jesus will be right on his heels
and blow him away. The Master appears
and--puﬀ!--the Anarchist is out of there.
9 The Anarchist's coming is all Satan's
work. All his power and signs and
miracles are fake,
10 evil sleight of hand that plays to the
gallery of those who hate the truth that
could save them.
11 And since they're so obsessed with
evil, God rubs their noses in it--gives
them what they want.
12 Since they refuse to trust truth,
they're banished to their chosen world
of lies and illusions.
13 Meanwhile, we've got our hands
full con nually thanking God for you,
our good friends--so loved by God! God
picked you out as his from the very start.2 THESSALONIANS 2 – 3
6
Think of it: included in God's original
plan of salva on by the bond of faith in
the living truth.
14 This is the life of the Spirit he
invited you to through the Message we
delivered, in which you get in on the
glory of our Master, Jesus Christ.
15 So, friends, take a ﬁrm stand, feet on
the ground and head high. Keep a ght
grip on what you were taught, whether
in personal conversa on or by our le er.
16 May Jesus himself and God our
Father, who reached out in love and
surprised you with gi s of unending help
and conﬁdence,
17 put a fresh heart in you, invigorate
your work, enliven your speech.
1 One more thing, friends: Pray for
us. Pray that the Master's Word will
simply take oﬀ and race through the
country to a groundswell of response,
just as it did among you.
32 THESSALONIANS 3
7
2 And pray that we'll be rescued from
these scoundrels who are trying to do us
in. I'm ﬁnding that not all "believers" are
believers.
3 But the Master never lets us down.
He'll s ck by you and protect you from
evil.
4 Because of the [Master], we have
great conﬁdence in [you]. We know
you're doing everything we told you and
will con nue doing it.
5 May the Master take you by the hand
and lead you along the path of God's
love and Christ's endurance.
6 Our orders--backed up by the Master,
Jesus--are to refuse to have anything to
do with those among you who are lazy
and refuse to work the way we taught
you. Don't permit them to freeload on
the rest.2 THESSALONIANS 3
8
7 We showed you how to pull your
weight when we were with you, so get
on with it.
8 We didn't sit around on our hands
expec ng others to take care of us. In
fact, we worked our ﬁngers to the bone,
up half the night moonligh ng so you
wouldn't be burdened with taking care
of us.
9 And it wasn't because we didn't have
a right to your support; we did. We
simply wanted to provide an example
of diligence, hoping it would prove
contagious.
10 Don't you remember the rule we had
when we lived with you? "If you don't
work, you don't eat."
11 And now we're ge ng reports that
a bunch of lazy good-for-nothings are
taking advantage of you.
12 This must not be tolerated. We
command them to get to work2 THESSALONIANS 3
9
immediately--no excuses, no arguments-
-and earn their own keep.
13 Friends, don't slack oﬀ in doing your
duty.
14 If anyone refuses to obey our clear
command wri en in this le er, don't
let him get by with it. Point out such
a person and refuse to subsidize his
freeloading. Maybe then he'll think
twice.
15 But don't treat him as an enemy. Sit
him down and talk about the problem as
someone who cares.
16 May the Master of Peace himself give
you the gi of ge ng along with each
other at all mes, in all ways. May the
Master be truly among you!
17 I, Paul, bid you good-bye in my own
handwri ng. I do this in all my le ers, so
examine my signature as proof that the
le er is genuine.2 THESSALONIANS 3
10
18 The incredible grace of our Master,
Jesus Christ, be with all of you!1 Timothy
1
1 I, Paul, am an apostle on special
assignment for Christ, our living
hope. Under God our Savior's command,
2 I'm wri ng this to you, Timothy, my
son in the faith. All the best from our
God and Christ be yours!
3 On my way to the province of
Macedonia, I advised you to stay in
Ephesus. Well, I haven't changed my
mind. Stay right there on top of things so
that the teaching stays on track.
4 Apparently some people have been
introducing fantasy stories and fanciful
family trees that digress into silliness
instead of pulling the people back
into the center, deepening faith and
obedience.1 TIMOTHY 1
2
5 The whole point of what we're urging
is simply love--[love] uncontaminated by
self-interest and counterfeit faith, a life
open to God.
6 Those who fail to keep to this point
soon wander oﬀ into cul-de-sacs of
gossip.
7 They set themselves up as experts
on religious issues, but haven't the
remotest idea of what they're holding
forth with such imposing eloquence.
8 It's true that moral guidance and
counsel need to be given, but the way
you say it and to whom you say it are as
important as what you say.
9 It's obvious, isn't it, that the law
code isn't primarily for people who live
responsibly, but for the irresponsible,
who defy all authority, riding roughshod
over God, life,
10 sex, truth, whatever!1 TIMOTHY 1
3
11 They are contemptuous of this great
Message I've been put in charge of by
this great God.
12 I'm so grateful to Christ Jesus for
making me adequate to do this work. He
went out on a limb, you know, in trus ng
me with this ministry.
13 The only creden als I brought to
it were invec ve and witch hunts and
arrogance. But I was treated mercifully
because I didn't know what I was
doing--didn't know Who I was doing it
against!
14 Grace mixed with faith and love
poured over me and into me. And all
because of Jesus.
15 Here's a word you can take to heart
and depend on: Jesus Christ came
into the world to save sinners. I'm
proof--Public Sinner Number One--
16 of someone who could never have
made it apart from sheer mercy. And1 TIMOTHY 1
4
now he shows me oﬀ--evidence of his
endless pa ence--to those who are right
on the edge of trus ng him forever.
17 Deep honor and bright glory to the
King of All Time--One God, Immortal,
Invisible, ever and always. Oh, yes!
18 I'm passing this work on to you, my
son Timothy. The prophe c word that
was directed to you prepared us for this.
All those prayers are coming together
now so you will do this well, fearless in
your struggle,
19 keeping a ﬁrm grip on your faith and
on yourself. A er all, this is a ﬁght we're
in. There are some, you know, who by
relaxing their grip and thinking anything
goes have made a thorough mess of
their faith.
20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are two
of them. I let them wander oﬀ to Satan
to be taught a lesson or two about not
blaspheming.1 TIMOTHY 2
2
5
1 The ﬁrst thing I want you to do is
pray. Pray every way you know how,
for everyone you know.
2 Pray especially for rulers and their
governments to rule well so we can
be quietly about our business of living
simply, in humble contempla on.
3 This is the way our Savior God wants
us to live.
4 He wants not only us but [everyone]
saved, you know, everyone to get to
know the truth [we've] learned:
5 that there's one God and only one,
and one Priest-Mediator between God
and us--Jesus,
6 who oﬀered himself in exchange for
everyone held cap ve by sin, to set them
all free. Eventually the news is going to
get out.
7 This and this only has been my
appointed work: ge ng this news to
those who have never heard of God, and1 TIMOTHY 2
6
explaining how it works by simple faith
and plain truth.
8 Since prayer is at the bo om of all
this, what I want mostly is for men to
pray--not shaking angry ﬁsts at enemies
but raising holy hands to God.
9 And I want women to get in there
with the men in humility before God, not
primping before a mirror or chasing the
latest fashions
10 but doing something beau ful for
God and becoming beau ful doing it.
11 I don't let women take over and tell
the men what to do.
12 They should study to be quiet and
obedient along with everyone else.
13 Adam was made ﬁrst, then Eve;
14 woman was deceived ﬁrst--our
pioneer in sin!--with Adam right on her
heels.
15 On the other hand, her childbearing
brought about salva on, reversing Eve.1 TIMOTHY 3
7
But this salva on only comes to those
who con nue in faith, love, and holiness,
gathering it all into maturity. You can
depend on this.
1 If anyone wants to provide
leadership in the church, good!
2 But there are precondi ons: A leader
must be well-thought-of, commi ed to
his wife, cool and collected, accessible,
and hospitable. He must know what he's
talking about,
3 not be overfond of wine, not pushy
but gentle, not thin-skinned, not
money-hungry.
4 He must handle his own aﬀairs well,
a en ve to his own children and having
their respect.
5 For if someone is unable to handle
his own aﬀairs, how can he take care of
God's church?
31 TIMOTHY 3
8
6 He must not be a new believer, lest
the posi on go to his head and the Devil
trip him up.
7 Outsiders must think well of him, or
else the Devil will ﬁgure out a way to
lure him into his trap.
8 The same goes for those who want to
be servants in the church: serious, not
decei ul, not too free with the bo le,
not in it for what they can get out of it.
9 They must be reverent before the
mystery of the faith, not using their
posi on to try to run things.
10 Let them prove themselves ﬁrst. If
they show they can do it, take them on.
11 No excep ons are to be made for
women--same qualiﬁca ons: serious,
dependable, not sharp-tongued, not
overfond of wine.
12 Servants in the church are to be
commi ed to their spouses, a en ve1 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
9
to their own children, and diligent in
looking a er their own aﬀairs.
13 Those who do this servant work will
come to be highly respected, a real
credit to this Jesus-faith.
14 I hope to visit you soon, but just in
case I'm delayed, I'm wri ng this le er
so
15 you'll know how things ought to go in
God's household, this God-alive church,
bas on of truth.
16 This Chris an life is a great mystery,
far exceeding our understanding, but
some things are clear enough: He
appeared in a human body, was proved
right by the invisible Spirit, was seen by
angels. He was proclaimed among all
kinds of peoples, believed in all over the
world, taken up into heavenly glory.
1 The Spirit makes it clear that as
me goes on, some are going to give
41 TIMOTHY 4
10
up on the faith and chase a er demonic
illusions put forth by professional liars.
2 These liars have lied so well and for so
long that they've lost their capacity for
truth.
3 They will tell you not to get married.
They'll tell you not to eat this or that
food--perfectly good food God created to
be eaten hear ly and with thanksgiving
by Chris ans!
4 Everything God created is good, and
to be received with thanks. Nothing is to
be sneered at and thrown out.
5 God's Word and our prayers make
every item in crea on holy.
6 You've been raised on the Message
of the faith and have followed sound
teaching. Now pass on this counsel to
the Chris ans there, and you'll be a good
servant of Jesus.1 TIMOTHY 4
11
7 Stay clear of silly stories that get
dressed up as religion. Exercise daily in
God--no spiritual ﬂabbiness, please!
8 Workouts in the gymnasium are
useful, but a disciplined life in God is far
more so, making you ﬁt both today and
forever.
9 You can count on this. Take it to heart.
10 This is why we've thrown ourselves
into this venture so totally. We're
banking on the living God, Savior of all
men and women, especially believers.
11 Get the word out. Teach all these
things.
12 And don't let anyone put you down
because you're young. Teach believers
with your life: by word, by demeanor, by
love, by faith, by integrity.
13 Stay at your post reading Scripture,
giving counsel, teaching.
14 And that special gi of ministry
you were given when the leaders of1 TIMOTHY 4 – 5
12
the church laid hands on you and
prayed--keep that dusted oﬀ and in use.
15 Cul vate these things. Immerse
yourself in them. The people will all see
you mature right before their eyes!
16 Keep a ﬁrm grasp on both your
character and your teaching. Don't be
diverted. Just keep at it. Both you and
those who hear you will experience
salva on.
1 Don't be harsh or impa ent with an
older man. Talk to him as you would
your own father, and to the younger
men as your brothers.
2 Reverently honor an older woman as
you would your mother, and the younger
women as sisters.
3 Take care of widows who are des tute.
4 If a widow has family members to take
care of her, let them learn that religion
begins at their own doorstep and that
they should pay back with gra tude
51 TIMOTHY 5
13
some of what they have received. This
pleases God immensely.
5 You can tell a legi mate widow by the
way she has put all her hope in God,
praying to him constantly for the needs
of others as well as her own.
6 But a widow who exploits people's
emo ons and pocketbooks--well, there's
nothing to her.
7 Tell these things to the people so
that they will do the right thing in their
extended family.
8 Anyone who neglects to care for
family members in need repudiates
the faith. That's worse than refusing to
believe in the ﬁrst place.
9 Sign some widows up for the special
ministry of oﬀering assistance. They will
in turn receive support from the church.
They must be over sixty, married only
once,1 TIMOTHY 5
10 and have a reputa
14
on for helping out
with children, strangers, red Chris ans,
the hurt and troubled.
11 Don't put young widows on this list.
No sooner will they get on than they'll
want to get oﬀ, obsessed with wan ng
to get a husband rather than serving
Christ in this way.
12 By breaking their word, they're liable
to go from bad to worse,
13 fri ering away their days on empty
talk, gossip, and triviali es.
14 No, I'd rather the young widows go
ahead and get married in the ﬁrst place,
have children, manage their homes, and
not give cri cs any foothold for ﬁnding
fault.
15 Some of them have already le and
gone a er Satan.
16 Any Chris an woman who has
widows in her family is responsible for
them. They shouldn't be dumped on the1 TIMOTHY 5
15
church. The church has its hands full
already with widows who need help.
17 Give a bonus to leaders who do a
good job, especially the ones who work
hard at preaching and teaching.
18 Scripture tells us, "Don't muzzle a
working ox," and, "A worker deserves his
pay."
19 Don't listen to a complaint against
a leader that isn't backed up by two or
three responsible witnesses.
20 If anyone falls into sin, call that
person on the carpet. Those who are
inclined that way will know right oﬀ they
can't get by with it.
21 God and Jesus and angels all back me
up in these instruc ons. Carry them out
without favori sm, without taking sides.
22 Don't appoint people to church
leadership posi ons too has ly. If a
person is involved in some serious sins,
you don't want to become an unwi ng1 TIMOTHY 5 – 6
16
accomplice. In any event, keep a close
check on yourself.
23 And don't worry too much about
what the cri cs will say. Go ahead and
drink a li le wine, for instance; it's good
for your diges on, good medicine for
what ails you.
24 The sins of some people are blatant
and march them right into court. The
sins of others don't show up un l much
later.
25 The same with good deeds. Some
you see right oﬀ, but none are hidden
forever.
1 Whoever is a slave must make the
best of it, giving respect to his master
so that outsiders don't blame God and
our teaching for his behavior.
2 Slaves with Chris an masters all the
more so--their masters are really their
beloved brothers! These are the things I
want you to teach and preach.
61 TIMOTHY 6
17
3 If you have leaders there who teach
otherwise, who refuse the solid words
of our Master Jesus and this godly
instruc on,
4 tag them for what they are: ignorant
windbags who infect the air with germs
of envy, controversy, bad-mouthing,
suspicious rumors.
5 Eventually there's an epidemic of
backstabbing, and truth is but a distant
memory. They think religion is a way to
make a fast buck.
6 A devout life does bring wealth, but
it's the rich simplicity of being yourself
before God.
7 Since we entered the world penniless
and will leave it penniless,
8 if we have bread on the table and
shoes on our feet, that's enough.
9 But if it's only money these leaders
are a er, they'll self-destruct in no me.1 TIMOTHY 6
18
10 Lust for money brings trouble and
nothing but trouble. Going down that
path, some lose their foo ng in the faith
completely and live to regret it bi erly
ever a er.
11 But you, Timothy, man of God: Run
for your life from all this. Pursue a
righteous life--a life of wonder, faith,
love, steadiness, courtesy.
12 Run hard and fast in the faith. Seize
the eternal life, the life you were called
to, the life you so fervently embraced in
the presence of so many witnesses.
13 I'm charging you before the life-giving
God and before Christ, who took his
stand before Pon us Pilate and didn't
give an inch:
14 Keep this command to the le er, and
don't slack oﬀ. Our Master, Jesus Christ,
is on his way.1 TIMOTHY 6
15 He'll show up right on
19
me, his
arrival guaranteed by the Blessed and
Undisputed Ruler, High King, High God.
16 He's the only one death can't touch,
his light so bright no one can get
close. He's never been seen by human
eyes--human eyes can't take him in!
Honor to him, and eternal rule! Oh, yes.
17 Tell those rich in this world's wealth
to quit being so full of themselves and
so obsessed with money, which is here
today and gone tomorrow. Tell them to
go a er God, who piles on all the riches
we could ever manage--
18 to do good, to be rich in helping
others, to be extravagantly generous.
19 If they do that, they'll build a treasury
that will last, gaining life that is truly life.
20 And oh, my dear Timothy, guard the
treasure you were given! Guard it with
your life. Avoid the talk-show religion1 TIMOTHY 6
and the prac ced confusion of the
so-called experts.
21 People caught up in a lot of talk
can miss the whole point of faith.
Overwhelming grace keep you!
202 Timothy
1
1 I, Paul, am on special assignment
for Christ, carrying out God's plan
laid out in the Message of Life by Jesus.
2 I write this to you, Timothy, the son I
love so much. All the best from our God
and Christ be yours!
3 Every me I say your name in
prayer--which is prac cally all the me--I
thank God for you, the God I worship
with my whole life in the tradi on of my
ancestors.
4 I miss you a lot, especially when I
remember that last tearful good-bye,
and I look forward to a joy-packed
reunion.
5 That precious memory triggers
another: your honest faith--and what
a rich faith it is, handed down from2 TIMOTHY 1
2
your grandmother Lois to your mother
Eunice, and now to you!
6 And the special gi of ministry you
received when I laid hands on you and
prayed--keep that ablaze!
7 God doesn't want us to be shy with his
gi s, but bold and loving and sensible.
8 So don't be embarrassed to speak up
for our Master or for me, his prisoner.
Take your share of suﬀering for the
Message along with the rest of us. We
can only keep on going, a er all, by the
power of God,
9 who ﬁrst saved us and then called
us to this holy work. We had nothing
to do with it. It was all [his] idea, a gi
prepared for us in Jesus long before we
knew anything about it.
10 But we know it now. Since the
appearance of our Savior, nothing
could be plainer: death defeated, life2 TIMOTHY 1
3
vindicated in a steady blaze of light, all
through the work of Jesus.
11 This is the Message I've been set
apart to proclaim as preacher, emissary,
and teacher.
12 It's also the cause of all this trouble
I'm in. But I have no regrets. I couldn't
be more sure of my ground--the One
I've trusted in can take care of what he's
trusted me to do right to the end.
13 So keep at your work, this faith and
love rooted in Christ, exactly as I set it
out for you. It's as sound as the day you
ﬁrst heard it from me.
14 Guard this precious thing placed in
your custody by the Holy Spirit who
works in us.
15 I'm sure you know by now that
everyone in the province of Asia
deserted me, even Phygelus and
Hermogenes.2 TIMOTHY 1 – 2
4
16 But God bless Onesiphorus and
his family! Many's the me I've been
refreshed in that house. And he wasn't
embarrassed a bit that I was in jail.
17 The ﬁrst thing he did when he got to
Rome was look me up.
18 May God on the Last Day treat him
as well as he treated me. And then
there was all the help he provided in
Ephesus--but you know that be er than
I.
1 So, my son, throw yourself into this
work for Christ.
2 Pass on what you heard from me--the
whole congrega on saying Amen!--to
reliable leaders who are competent to
teach others.
3 When the going gets rough, take it
on the chin with the rest of us, the way
Jesus did.
22 TIMOTHY 2
5
4 A soldier on duty doesn't get caught
up in making deals at the marketplace.
He concentrates on carrying out orders.
5 An athlete who refuses to play by the
rules will never get anywhere.
6 It's the diligent farmer who gets the
produce.
7 Think it over. God will make it all plain.
8 Fix this picture ﬁrmly in your mind:
Jesus, descended from the line of David,
raised from the dead. It's what you've
heard from me all along.
9 It's what I'm si ng in jail for right
now--but God's Word isn't in jail!
10 That's why I s ck it out here--so that
everyone God calls will get in on the
salva on of Christ in all its glory.
11 This is a sure thing: If we die with
him, we'll live with him;
12 If we s ck it out with him, we'll rule
with him; If we turn our backs on him,
he'll turn his back on us;2 TIMOTHY 2
6
13 If we give up on him, he does not give
up--for there's no way he can be false to
himself.
14 Repeat these basic essen als over
and over to God's people. Warn them
before God against pious nitpicking,
which chips away at the faith. It just
wears everyone out.
15 Concentrate on doing your best for
God, work you won't be ashamed of,
laying out the truth plain and simple.
16 Stay clear of pious talk that is only
talk. Words are not mere words, you
know. If they're not backed by a godly
life,
17 they accumulate as poison in the
soul. Hymenaeus and Philetus are
examples,
18 throwing believers oﬀ stride and
missing the truth by a mile by saying the
resurrec on is over and done with.2 TIMOTHY 2
19 Meanwhile, God's ﬁrm founda
7
on
is as ﬁrm as ever, these sentences
engraved on the stones: GOD KNOWS
WHO BELONGS TO HIM. SPURN EVIL,
ALL YOU WHO NAME GOD AS GOD
20 In a well-furnished kitchen there
are not only crystal goblets and silver
pla ers, but waste cans and compost
buckets--some containers used to serve
ﬁne meals, others to take out the
garbage.
21 Become the kind of container God
can use to present any and every kind of
gi to his guests for their blessing.
22 Run away from infan le indulgence.
Run a er mature righteousness--faith,
love, peace--joining those who are in
honest and serious prayer before God.
23 Refuse to get involved in inane
discussions; they always end up in ﬁghts.2 TIMOTHY 2 – 3
8
24 God's servant must not be
argumenta ve, but a gentle listener and
a teacher who keeps cool,
25 working ﬁrmly but pa ently with
those who refuse to obey. You never
know how or when God might sober
them up with a change of heart and a
turning to the truth,
26 enabling them to escape the Devil's
trap, where they are caught and held
cap ve, forced to run his errands.
1 Don't be naive. There are diﬃcult
mes ahead.
2 As the end approaches, people are
going to be self-absorbed, money-
hungry, self-promo ng, stuck-up,
profane, contemptuous of parents,
crude, coarse,
3 dog-eat-dog, unbending, slanderers,
impulsively wild, savage, cynical,
32 TIMOTHY 3
9
4 treacherous, ruthless, bloated
windbags, addicted to lust, and allergic
to God.
5 They'll make a show of religion, but
behind the scenes they're animals. Stay
clear of these people.
6 These are the kind of people who
smooth-talk themselves into the homes
of unstable and needy women and
take advantage of them; women who,
depressed by their sinfulness, take up
with every new religious fad that calls
itself "truth."
7 They get exploited every me and
never really learn.
8 These men are like those old Egyp an
frauds Jannes and Jambres, who
challenged Moses. They were rejects
from the faith, twisted in their thinking,
defying truth itself.
9 But nothing will come of these latest
impostors. Everyone will see through2 TIMOTHY 3
10
them, just as people saw through that
Egyp an hoax.
10 You've been a good appren ce to
me, a part of my teaching, my manner
of life, direc on, faith, steadiness, love,
pa ence,
11 troubles, suﬀerings--suﬀering along
with me in all the grief I had to put up
with in An och, Iconium, and Lystra. And
you also well know that God rescued
me!
12 Anyone who wants to live all out for
Christ is in for a lot of trouble; there's no
ge ng around it.
13 Unscrupulous con men will con nue
to exploit the faith. They're as deceived
as the people they lead astray. As long
as they are out there, things can only get
worse.
14 But don't let it faze you. S ck with
what you learned and believed, sure of
the integrity of your teachers--2 TIMOTHY 3 – 4
11
15 why, you took in the sacred Scriptures
with your mother's milk! There's nothing
like the wri en Word of God for showing
you the way to salva on through faith in
Christ Jesus.
16 Every part of Scripture is God-
breathed and useful one way or
another--showing us truth, exposing
our rebellion, correc ng our mistakes,
training us to live God's way.
17 Through the Word we are put
together and shaped up for the tasks
God has for us.
1 I can't impress this on you too
strongly. God is looking over your
shoulder. Christ himself is the Judge,
with the ﬁnal say on everyone, living and
dead. He is about to break into the open
with his rule,
2 so proclaim the Message with
intensity; keep on your watch.
42 TIMOTHY 4
12
Challenge, warn, and urge your people.
Don't ever quit. Just keep it simple.
3 You're going to ﬁnd that there will be
mes when people will have no stomach
for solid teaching, but will ﬁll up on
spiritual junk food--catchy opinions that
ckle their fancy.
4 They'll turn their backs on truth and
chase mirages.
5 But [you]--keep your eye on what
you're doing; accept the hard mes
along with the good; keep the Message
alive; do a thorough job as God's servant.
6 You take over. I'm about to die, my life
an oﬀering on God's altar.
7 This is the only race worth running.
I've run hard right to the ﬁnish, believed
all the way.
8 All that's le now is the shou ng--
God's applause! Depend on it, he's an
honest judge. He'll do right not only2 TIMOTHY 4
13
by me, but by everyone eager for his
coming.
9 Get here as fast as you can.
10 Demas, chasing fads, went oﬀ to
Thessalonica and le me here. Crescens
is in Gala a province, Titus in Dalma a.
11 Luke is the only one here with
me. Bring Mark with you; he'll be my
right-hand man
12 since I'm sending Tychicus to
Ephesus.
13 Bring the winter coat I le in
Troas with Carpus; also the books and
parchment notebooks.
14 Watch out for Alexander the
coppersmith.
15 Fiercely opposed to our Message, he
caused no end of trouble. God will give
him what he's got coming.
16 At my preliminary hearing no one
stood by me. They all ran like scared
rabbits. But it doesn't ma er--2 TIMOTHY 4
14
17 the Master stood by me and helped
me spread the Message loud and clear
to those who had never heard it. I was
snatched from the jaws of the lion!
18 God's looking a er me, keeping me
safe in the kingdom of heaven. All praise
to him, praise forever! Oh, yes!
19 Say hello to Priscilla and Aquila; also,
the family of Onesiphorus.
20 Erastus stayed behind in Corinth. I
had to leave Trophimus sick in Miletus.
21 Try hard to get here before winter.
Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all
your friends here send gree ngs.
22 God be with you. Grace be with you.Titus

1 I, Paul, am God's slave and Christ's
agent for promo ng the faith among
God's chosen people, ge ng out the
accurate word on God and how to
respond rightly to it.
2 My aim is to raise hopes by poin ng
the way to life without end. This is the
life God promised long ago--and he
doesn't break promises!
3 And then when the me was ripe,
he went public with his truth. I've been
entrusted to proclaim this Message by
order of our Savior, God himself.
4 Dear Titus, legi mate son in the faith:
Receive everything God our Father and
Jesus our Savior give you!
5 I le you in charge in Crete so you

Appoint leaders in every town according
to my instruc ons.
6 As you select them, ask, "Is this
man well-thought-of? Are his children
believers? Do they respect him and stay
out of trouble?"
7 It's important that a church leader,
responsible for the aﬀairs in God's
house, be looked up to--not pushy, not
short-tempered, not a drunk, not a bully,
not money-hungry.
8 He must welcome people, be helpful,
wise, fair, reverent, have a good grip on
himself,
9 and have a good grip on the Message,
knowing how to use the truth to either
spur people on in knowledge or stop
them in their tracks if they oppose it.
10 For there are a lot of rebels out
there, full of loose, confusing, and
deceiving talk. Those who were broughtTITUS 1
3
up religious and ought to know be er
are the worst.
11 They've got to be shut up. They're
disrup ng en re families with their
teaching, and all for the sake of a fast
buck.
12 One of their own prophets said it
best: The Cretans are liars from the
womb, barking dogs, lazy bellies.
13 He certainly spoke the truth. Get on
them right away. Stop that diseased talk
of Jewish make-believe and made-up
rules
14 so they can recover a robust faith.
15 Everything is clean to the clean-
minded; nothing is clean to dirty-minded
unbelievers. They leave their dirty
ﬁngerprints on every thought and act.
16 They say they know God, but
their ac ons speak louder than their
words. They're real creeps, disobedient
good-for-nothings.TITUS 2

1 Your job is to speak out on the
things that make for solid doctrine.
2 Guide older men into lives of
temperance, dignity, and wisdom, into
healthy faith, love, and endurance.
3 Guide older women into lives of
reverence so they end up as neither
gossips nor drunks, but models of
goodness.
4 By looking at them, the younger
women will know how to love their
husbands and children,
5 be virtuous and pure, keep a good
house, be good wives. We don't want
anyone looking down on God's Message
because of their behavior.
6 Also, guide the young men to live
disciplined lives.
7 But mostly, show them all this by
doing it yourself, incorrup ble in your
teaching,TITUS 2
5
8 your words solid and sane. Then
anyone who is dead set against us, when
he ﬁnds nothing weird or misguided,
might eventually come around.
9 Guide slaves into being loyal workers,
a bonus to their masters--no back talk,
10 no pe y thievery. Then their good
character will shine through their
ac ons, adding luster to the teaching of
our Savior God.
11 God's readiness to give and forgive
is now public. Salva on's available for
everyone!
12 We're being shown how to turn
our backs on a godless, indulgent
life, and how to take on a God-ﬁlled,
God-honoring life. This new life is
star ng right now,
13 and is whe ng our appe tes for the
glorious day when our great God and
Savior, Jesus Christ, appears.TITUS 2 – 3
6
14 He oﬀered himself as a sacriﬁce
to free us from a dark, rebellious life
into this good, pure life, making us a
people he can be proud of, energe c in
goodness.
15 Tell them all this. Build up their
courage, and discipline them if they get
out of line. You're in charge. Don't let
anyone put you down.
1 Remind the people to respect the
government and be law-abiding,
always ready to lend a helping hand
2 No insults, no ﬁghts. God's people
should be bighearted and courteous.
3 It wasn't so long ago that we ourselves
were stupid and stubborn, dupes of
sin, ordered every which way by our
glands, going around with a chip on our
shoulder, hated and ha ng back.
4 But when God, our kind and loving
Savior God, stepped in,
3TITUS 3
7
5 he saved us from all that. It was all his
doing; we had nothing to do with it. He
gave us a good bath, and we came out of
it new people, washed inside and out by
the Holy Spirit.
6 Our Savior Jesus poured out new life
so generously.
7 God's gi has restored our rela onship
with him and given us back our lives. And
there's more life to come--an eternity of
life!
8 You can count on this. I want you to
put your foot down. Take a ﬁrm stand on
these ma ers so that those who have
put their trust in God will concentrate
on the essen als that are good for
everyone.
9 Stay away from mindless, pointless
quarreling over genealogies and ﬁne
print in the law code. That gets you
nowhere.TITUS 3
8
10 Warn a quarrelsome person once or
twice, but then be done with him.
11 It's obvious that such a person is
out of line, rebellious against God. By
persis ng in divisiveness he cuts himself
oﬀ.
12 As soon as I send either Artemas or
Tychicus to you, come immediately and
meet me in Nicopolis. I've decided to
spend the winter there.
13 Give Zenas the lawyer and Apollos a
hearty send-oﬀ. Take good care of them.
14 Our people have to learn to be
diligent in their work so that all
necessi es are met (especially among
the needy) and they don't end up with
nothing to show for their lives.
15 All here want to be remembered to
you. Say hello to our friends in the faith.
Grace to all of you.Philemon

1 I, Paul, am a prisoner for the
sake of Christ, here with my
brother Timothy. I write this le er to
you, Philemon, my good friend and
companion in this work--
2 also to our sister Apphia, to Archippus,
a real trooper, and to the church that
meets in your house.
3 God's best to you! Christ's blessings
on you!
4 Every me your name comes up in my
prayers, I say, "Oh, thank you, God!"
5 I keep hearing of the love and faith
you have for the Master Jesus, which
brims over to other Chris ans.
6 And I keep praying that this faith we
hold in common keeps showing up inPHILEMON 1
2
the good things we do, and that people
recognize Christ in all of it.
7 Friend, you have no idea how good
your love makes me feel, doubly so when
I see your hospitality to fellow believers.
8 In line with all this I have a favor to ask
of you. As Christ's ambassador and now
a prisoner for him, I wouldn't hesitate to
command this if I thought it necessary,
9 but I'd rather make it a personal
request.
10 While here in jail, I've fathered
a child, so to speak. And here he is,
hand-carrying this le er--Onesimus!
11 He was useless to you before; now
he's useful to both of us.
12 I'm sending him back to you, but it
feels like I'm cu ng oﬀ my right arm in
doing so.
13 I wanted in the worst way to keep
him here as your stand-in to help out
while I'm in jail for the Message.PHILEMON 1
3
14 But I didn't want to do anything
behind your back, make you do a good
deed that you hadn't willingly agreed to.
15 Maybe it's all for the best that you
lost him for a while. You're ge ng him
back now for good--
16 and no mere slave this me, but a
true Chris an brother! That's what he
was to me--he'll be even more than that
to you.
17 So if you s ll consider me a comrade-
in-arms, welcome him back as you would
me.
18 If he damaged anything or owes you
anything, chalk it up to my account.
19 This is my personal signature--Paul-
-and I stand behind it. (I don't need to
remind you, do I, that you owe your very
life to me?)
20 Do me this big favor, friend. You'll be
doing it for Christ, but it will also do my
heart good.PHILEMON 1
4
21 I know you well enough to know you
will. You'll probably go far beyond what
I've wri en.
22 And by the way, get a room ready
for me. Because of your prayers, I fully
expect to be your guest again.
23 Epaphras, my cellmate in the cause
of Christ, says hello.
24 Also my coworkers Mark, Aristarchus,
Demas, and Luke.
25 All the best to you from the Master,
Jesus Christ!Hebrews

1 Going through a long line of
prophets, God has been addressing
our ancestors in diﬀerent ways for
centuries.
2 Recently he spoke to us directly
through his Son. By his Son, God created
the world in the beginning, and it will all
belong to the Son at the end.
3 This Son perfectly mirrors God,
and is stamped with God's nature. He
holds everything together by what he
says--powerful words! A er he ﬁnished
the sacriﬁce for sins, the Son took his
honored place high in the heavens right
alongside God,
4 far higher than any angel in rank and
rule.HEBREWS 1
2
5 Did God ever say to an angel, "You're
my Son; today I celebrate you"? Or, "I'm
his Father, he's my Son"?
6 When he presents his honored Son
to the world, he says, "All angels must
worship him."
7 Regarding angels he says, The
messengers are winds, the servants are
tongues of ﬁre.
8 But he says to the Son, You're God,
and on the throne for good; your rule
makes everything right.
9 You love it when things are right; you
hate it when things are wrong. That is
why God, your God, poured fragrant oil
on your head, Marking you out as king,
far above your dear companions.
10 And again to the Son, You, Master,
started it all, laid earth's founda ons,
then cra ed the stars in the sky.HEBREWS 1 – 2
3
11 Earth and sky will wear out, but not
you; they become threadbare like an old
coat;
12 You'll fold them up like a worn-out
cloak, and lay them away on the shelf.
But you'll stay the same, year a er year;
you'll never fade, you'll never wear out.
13 And did he ever say anything like this
to an angel? Sit alongside me here on
my throne Un l I make your enemies a
stool for your feet.
14 Isn't it obvious that all angels are
sent to help out with those lined up to
receive salva on?
1 It's crucial that we keep a ﬁrm grip
on what we've heard so that we
don't dri oﬀ.
2 If the old message delivered by the
angels was valid and nobody got away
with anything,
3 do you think we can risk neglec ng
this latest message, this magniﬁcent
2HEBREWS 2
4
salva on? First of all, it was delivered in
person by the Master, then accurately
passed on to us by those who heard it
from him.
4 All the while God was valida ng it
with gi s through the Holy Spirit, all
sorts of signs and miracles, as he saw ﬁt.
5 God didn't put angels in charge of this
business of salva on that we're dealing
with here.
6 It says in Scripture, What is man and
woman that you bother with them; why
take a second look their way?
7 You made them not quite as high as
angels, bright with Eden's dawn light;
8 Then you put them in charge of your
en re handcra ed world. When God put
them in charge of everything, nothing
was excluded. But we don't see it yet,
don't see everything under human
jurisdic on.HEBREWS 2
5
9 What we do see is Jesus, made
"not quite as high as angels," and
then, through the experience of death,
crowned so much higher than any angel,
with a glory "bright with Eden's dawn
light." In that death, by God's grace, he
fully experienced death in every person's
place.
10 It makes good sense that the God
who got everything started and keeps
everything going now completes the
work by making the Salva on Pioneer
perfect through suﬀering as he leads all
these people to glory.
11 Since the One who saves and those
who are saved have a common origin,
Jesus doesn't hesitate to treat them as
family,
12 saying, I'll tell my good friends, my
brothers and sisters, all I know about
you; I'll join them in worship and praise
to you.HEBREWS 2
6
13 Again, he puts himself in the same
family circle when he says, Even I live by
placing my trust in God. And yet again,
I'm here with the children God gave me.
14 Since the children are made of ﬂesh
and blood, it's logical that the Savior took
on ﬂesh and blood in order to rescue
them by his death. By embracing death,
taking it into himself, he destroyed the
Devil's hold on death
15 and freed all who cower through life,
scared to death of death.
16 It's obvious, of course, that he didn't
go to all this trouble for angels. It was for
people like us, children of Abraham.
17 That's why he had to enter into every
detail of human life. Then, when he
came before God as high priest to get rid
of the people's sins,
18 he would have already experienced
it all himself--all the pain, all the tes ng-HEBREWS 3
7
-and would be able to help where help
was needed.
1 So, my dear Chris an friends,
companions in following this call to
the heights, take a good hard look at
Jesus. He's the centerpiece of everything
we believe,
2 faithful in everything God gave him to
do. Moses was also faithful,
3 but Jesus gets far more honor. A
builder is more valuable than a building
any day.
4 Every house has a builder, but the
Builder behind them all is God.
5 Moses did a good job in God's house,
but it was all servant work, ge ng things
ready for what was to come.
6 Christ as Son is in charge of the house.
Now, if we can only keep a ﬁrm grip on
this bold conﬁdence, we're the house!
7 That's why the Holy Spirit says, Today,
please listen;
3HEBREWS 3
8
8 don't turn a deaf ear as in "the
bi er uprising," that me of wilderness
tes ng!
9 Even though they watched me at work
for forty years, your ancestors refused to
let me do it my way; over and over they
tried my pa ence.
10 And I was provoked, oh, so provoked!
I said, "They'll never keep their minds on
God; they refuse to walk down my road."
11 Exasperated, I vowed, "They'll never
get where they're going, never be able
to sit down and rest."
12 So watch your step, friends. Make
sure there's no evil unbelief lying around
that will trip you up and throw you oﬀ
course, diver ng you from the living
God.
13 For as long as it's s ll God's Today,
keep each other on your toes so sin
doesn't slow down your reﬂexes.HEBREWS 3 – 4
9
14 If we can only keep our grip on the
sure thing we started out with, we're in
this with Christ for the long haul.
15 These words keep ringing in our ears:
Today, please listen; don't turn a deaf
ear as in the bi er uprising.
16 For who were the people who turned
a deaf ear? Weren't they the very ones
Moses led out of Egypt?
17 And who was God provoked with for
forty years? Wasn't it those who turned
a deaf ear and ended up corpses in the
wilderness?
18 And when he swore that they'd never
get where they were going, wasn't he
talking to the ones who turned a deaf
ear?
19 They never got there because they
never listened, never believed.
1 For as long, then, as that promise
of res ng in him pulls us on to God's
4HEBREWS 4
10
goal for us, we need to be careful that
we're not disqualiﬁed.
2 We received the same promises as
those people in the wilderness, but the
promises didn't do them a bit of good
because they didn't receive the promises
with faith.
3 If we believe, though, we'll experience
that state of res ng. But not if we don't
have faith. Remember that God said,
Exasperated, I vowed, "They'll never
get where they're going, never be able
to sit down and rest." God made that
vow, even though he'd ﬁnished his part
before the founda on of the world.
4 Somewhere it's wri en, "God rested
the seventh day, having completed his
work,"
5 but in this other text he says, "They'll
never be able to sit down and rest."
6 So this promise has not yet been
fulﬁlled. Those earlier ones never did getHEBREWS 4
11
to the place of rest because they were
disobedient.
7 God keeps renewing the promise and
se ng the date as today, just as he did
in David's psalm, centuries later than the
original invita on: Today, please listen,
don't turn a deaf ear...
8 And so this is s ll a live promise. It
wasn't canceled at the me of Joshua;
otherwise, God wouldn't keep renewing
the appointment for "today."
9 The promise of "arrival" and "rest" is
s ll there for God's people.
10 God himself is at rest. And at the end
of the journey we'll surely rest with God.
11 So let's keep at it and eventually
arrive at the place of rest, not drop out
through some sort of disobedience.
12 God means what he says. What he
says goes. His powerful Word is sharp
as a surgeon's scalpel, cu ng throughHEBREWS 4 – 5
12
everything, whether doubt or defense,
laying us open to listen and obey.
13 Nothing and no one is impervious
to God's Word. We can't get away from
it--no ma er what.
14 Now that we know what we have--
Jesus, this great High Priest with ready
access to God--let's not let it slip through
our ﬁngers.
15 We don't have a priest who is out of
touch with our reality. He's been through
weakness and tes ng, experienced it
all--all but the sin.
16 So let's walk right up to him and get
what he is so ready to give. Take the
mercy, accept the help.
1 Every high priest selected to
represent men and women before
God and oﬀer sacriﬁces for their sins
2 should be able to deal gently with
their failings, since he knows what it's
like from his own experience.
5HEBREWS 5
13
3 But that also means that he has to
oﬀer sacriﬁces for his own sins as well as
the people's.
4 No one elects himself to this honored
posi on. He's called to it by God, as
Aaron was.
5 Neither did Christ presume to set
himself up as high priest, but was set
apart by the One who said to him,
"You're my Son; today I celebrate you!"
6 In another place God declares, "You're
a priest forever in the royal order of
Melchizedek."
7 While he lived on earth, an cipa ng
death, Jesus cried out in pain and wept
in sorrow as he oﬀered up priestly
prayers to God. Because he honored
God, God answered him.
8 Though he was God's Son, he learned
trus ng-obedience by what he suﬀered,
just as we do.HEBREWS 5
14
9 Then, having arrived at the full
stature of his maturity and having been
announced by God as high priest in the
order of Melchizedek,
10 he became the source of eternal
salva on to all who believingly obey
him.
11 I have a lot more to say about this,
but it is hard to get it across to you since
you've picked up this bad habit of not
listening.
12 By this me you ought to be teachers
yourselves, yet here I ﬁnd you need
someone to sit down with you and go
over the basics on God again, star ng
from square one--baby's milk, when you
should have been on solid food long ago!
13 Milk is for beginners, inexperienced
in God's ways;
14 solid food is for the mature, who
have some prac ce in telling right from
wrong.HEBREWS 6

1 So come on, let's leave the
preschool ﬁngerpain ng exercises
on Christ and get on with the grand
work of art. Grow up in Christ. The basic
founda onal truths are in place: turning
your back on "salva on by self-help" and
turning in trust toward God;
2 bap smal instruc ons; laying on of
hands; resurrec on of the dead; eternal
judgment.
3 God helping us, we'll stay true to all
that. But there's so much more. Let's get
on with it!
4 Once people have seen the light,
go en a taste of heaven and been part
of the work of the Holy Spirit,
5 once they've personally experienced
the sheer goodness of God's Word and
the powers breaking in on us--
6 if then they turn their backs on
it, washing their hands of the whole
thing, well, they can't start over as ifHEBREWS 6
16
nothing happened. That's impossible.
Why, they've re-cruciﬁed Jesus! They've
repudiated him in public!
7 Parched ground that soaks up the
rain and then produces an abundance
of carrots and corn for its gardener gets
God's "Well done!"
8 But if it produces weeds and thistles,
it's more likely to get cussed out. Fields
like that are burned, not harvested.
9 I'm sure that won't happen to you,
friends. I have be er things in mind for
you--salva on things!
10 God doesn't miss anything. He knows
perfectly well all the love you've shown
him by helping needy Chris ans, and
that you keep at it.
11 And now I want each of you to extend
that same intensity toward a full-bodied
hope, and keep at it ll the ﬁnish.
12 Don't drag your feet. Be like those
who stay the course with commi edHEBREWS 6
17
faith and then get everything promised
to them.
13 When God made his promise to
Abraham, he backed it to the hilt, pu ng
his own reputa on on the line.
14 He said, "I promise that I'll bless you
with everything I have--bless and bless
and bless!"
15 Abraham stuck it out and got
everything that had been promised to
him.
16 When people make promises, they
guarantee them by appeal to some
authority above them so that if there
is any ques on that they'll make good
on the promise, the authority will back
them up.
17 When God wanted to guarantee his
promises, he gave his word, a rock-solid
guarantee--
18 God [can't] break his word. And
because his word cannot change, theHEBREWS 6 – 7
18
promise is likewise unchangeable. We
who have run for our very lives to God
have every reason to grab the promised
hope with both hands and never let go.
19 It's an unbreakable spiritual lifeline,
reaching past all appearances right to
the very presence of God
20 where Jesus, running on ahead of
us, has taken up his permanent post
as high priest for us, in the order of
Melchizedek.
1 Melchizedek was king of Salem
and priest of the Highest God. He
met Abraham, who was returning from
"the royal massacre," and gave him his
blessing.
2 Abraham in turn gave him a tenth
of the spoils. "Melchizedek" means
"King of Righteousness." "Salem" means
"Peace." So, he is also "King of Peace."
3 Melchizedek towers out of the
past--without record of family es, no
7HEBREWS 7
19
account of beginning or end. In this
way he is like the Son of God, one
huge priestly presence domina ng the
landscape always.
4 You realize just how great Melchizedek
is when you see that Father Abraham
gave him a tenth of the captured
treasure.
5 Priests descended from Levi are
commanded by law to collect thes from
the people, even though they are all
more or less equals, priests and people,
having a common father in Abraham.
6 But this man, a complete outsider,
collected thes from Abraham and
blessed him, the one to whom the
promises had been given.
7 In acts of blessing, the lesser is blessed
by the greater.
8 Or look at it this way: We pay our
thes to priests who die, but AbrahamHEBREWS 7
20
paid thes to a priest who, the Scripture
says, "lives."
9 Ul mately you could even say that
since Levi descended from Abraham,
who paid thes to Melchizedek,
10 when we pay thes to the priestly
tribe of Levi they end up with
Melchizedek.
11 If the priesthood of Levi and Aaron,
which provided the framework for the
giving of the law, could really make
people perfect, there wouldn't have
been need for a new priesthood like that
of Melchizedek.
12 But since it didn't get the job done,
there was a change of priesthood, which
brought with it a radical new kind of law.
13 There is no way of understanding this
in terms of the old Levi cal priesthood,
14 which is why there is nothing in
Jesus' family tree connec ng him with
that priestly line.HEBREWS 7
21
15 But the Melchizedek story provides
a perfect analogy: Jesus, a priest like
Melchizedek,
16 not by genealogical descent but by
the sheer force of resurrec on life--he
lives!--
17 "priest forever in the royal order of
Melchizedek."
18 The former way of doing things, a
system of commandments that never
worked out the way it was supposed to,
was set aside;
19 the law brought nothing to maturity.
Another way--Jesus!--a way that [does]
work, that brings us right into the
presence of God, is put in its place.
20 The old priesthood of Aaron
perpetuated itself automa cally, father
to son, without explicit conﬁrma on by
God.
21 But then God intervened and called
this new, permanent priesthood intoHEBREWS 7
22
being with an added promise: God gave
his word; he won't take it back: "You're
the permanent priest."
22 This makes Jesus the guarantee of a
far be er way between us and God--one
that really works! A new covenant.
23 Earlier there were a lot of priests, for
they died and had to be replaced.
24 But Jesus' priesthood is permanent.
He's there from now to eternity
25 to save everyone who comes to God
through him, always on the job to speak
up for them.
26 So now we have a high priest who
perfectly ﬁts our needs: completely holy,
uncompromised by sin, with authority
extending as high as God's presence in
heaven itself.
27 Unlike the other high priests, he
doesn't have to oﬀer sacriﬁces for his
own sins every day before he can get
around to us and our sins. He's done it,HEBREWS 7 – 8
23
once and for all: oﬀered up [himself] as
the sacriﬁce.
28 The law appoints as high priests men
who are never able to get the job done
right. But this intervening command of
God, which came later, appoints the Son,
who is absolutely, eternally perfect.
1 In essence, we have just such a high
priest: authorita ve right alongside
God,
2 conduc ng worship in the one true
sanctuary built by God.
3 The assigned task of a high priest is to
oﬀer both gi s and sacriﬁces, and it's no
diﬀerent with the priesthood of Jesus.
4 If he were limited to earth, he
wouldn't even be a priest. We wouldn't
need him since there are plenty of
priests who oﬀer the gi s designated in
the law.
5 These priests provide only a hint of
what goes on in the true sanctuary
8HEBREWS 8
24
of heaven, which Moses caught a
glimpse of as he was about to set up the
tent-shrine. It was then that God said,
"Be careful to do it exactly as you saw it
on the Mountain."
6 But Jesus' priestly work far surpasses
what these other priests do, since he's
working from a far be er plan.
7 If the ﬁrst plan--the old covenant--had
worked out, a second wouldn't have
been needed.
8 But we know the ﬁrst was found
wan ng, because God said, Heads up!
The days are coming when I'll set up
a new plan for dealing with Israel and
Judah.
9 I'll throw out the old plan I set up with
their ancestors when I led them by the
hand out of Egypt. They didn't keep their
part of the bargain, so I looked away and
let it go.HEBREWS 8 – 9
25
10 This new plan I'm making with Israel
isn't going to be wri en on paper, isn't
going to be chiseled in stone; This me
I'm wri ng out the plan in them, carving
it on the lining of their hearts. I'll be their
God, they'll be my people.
11 They won't go to school to learn
about me, or buy a book called [God in
Five Easy Lessons]. They'll all get to know
me ﬁrsthand, the li le and the big, the
small and the great.
12 They'll get to know me by being
kindly forgiven, with the slate of their
sins forever wiped clean.
13 By coming up with a new plan, a new
covenant between God and his people,
God put the old plan on the shelf. And
there it stays, gathering dust.
1 That ﬁrst plan contained direc ons
for worship, and a specially designed
place of worship.
9HEBREWS 9
26
2 A large outer tent was set up. The
lampstand, the table, and "the bread of
presence" were placed in it. This was
called "the Holy Place."
3 Then a curtain was stretched, and
behind it a smaller, inside tent set up.
This was called "the Holy of Holies."
4 In it were placed the gold incense
altar and the gold-covered ark of the
covenant containing the gold urn of
manna, Aaron's rod that budded, the
covenant tablets,
5 and the angel-wing-shadowed mercy
seat. But we don't have me to comment
on these now.
6 A er this was set up, the priests went
about their du es in the large tent.
7 Only the high priest entered the
smaller, inside tent, and then only once
a year, oﬀering a blood sacriﬁce for his
own sins and the people's accumulated
sins.HEBREWS 9
27
8 This was the Holy Spirit's way of
showing with a visible parable that as
long as the large tent stands, people
can't just walk in on God.
9 Under this system, the gi s and
sacriﬁces can't really get to the heart of
the ma er, can't assuage the conscience
of the people,
10 but are limited to ma ers of ritual
and behavior. It's essen ally a temporary
arrangement un l a complete overhaul
could be made.
11 But when the Messiah arrived, high
priest of the superior things of this new
covenant, he bypassed the old tent and
its trappings in this created world and
went straight into heaven's "tent"--the
true Holy Place--once and for all.
12 He also bypassed the sacriﬁces
consis ng of goat and calf blood, instead
using his own blood as the price to set
us free once and for all.HEBREWS 9
28
13 If that animal blood and the other
rituals of puriﬁca on were eﬀec ve
in cleaning up certain ma ers of our
religion and behavior,
14 think how much more the blood of
Christ cleans up our whole lives, inside
and out.
15 Through the Spirit, Christ oﬀered
himself as an unblemished sacriﬁce,
freeing us from all those dead-end
eﬀorts to make ourselves respectable,
so that we can live all out for God.
16 Like a will that takes eﬀect when
someone dies, the new covenant was
put into ac on at Jesus' death. His
death marked the transi on from the
old plan to the new one, canceling the
old obliga ons and accompanying sins,
and summoning the heirs to receive the
eternal inheritance that was promised
them. He brought together God and his
people in this new way.HEBREWS 9
29
18 Even the ﬁrst plan required a death
to set it in mo on.
19 A er Moses had read out all the
terms of the plan of the law--God's
"will"--he took the blood of sacriﬁced
animals and, in a solemn ritual, sprinkled
the document and the people who were
its beneﬁciaries.
20 And then he a ested its validity with
the words, "This is the blood of the
covenant commanded by God."
21 He did the same thing with the place
of worship and its furniture.
22 Moses said to the people, "This
is the blood of the covenant God
has established with you." Prac cally
everything in a will hinges on a death.
That's why blood, the evidence of
death, is used so much in our tradi on,
especially regarding forgiveness of sins.
23 That accounts for the prominence of
blood and death in all these secondaryHEBREWS 9
30
prac ces that point to the reali es of
heaven. It also accounts for why, when
the real thing takes place, these animal
sacriﬁces aren't needed anymore, having
served their purpose.
24 For Christ didn't enter the earthly
version of the Holy Place; he entered the
Place Itself, and oﬀered himself to God
as the sacriﬁce for our sins.
25 He doesn't do this every year as the
high priests did under the old plan with
blood that was not their own;
26 if that had been the case, he would
have to sacriﬁce himself repeatedly
throughout the course of history. But
instead he sacriﬁced himself once
and for all, summing up all the other
sacriﬁces in this sacriﬁce of himself, the
ﬁnal solu on of sin.
27 Everyone has to die once, then face
the consequences.HEBREWS 9 – 10
28 Christ's death was also a one-
31
me
event, but it was a sacriﬁce that took
care of sins forever. And so, when he next
appears, the outcome for those eager to
greet him is, precisely, [salva on].
1 The old plan was only a hint
of the good things in the new
plan. Since that old "law plan" wasn't
complete in itself, it couldn't complete
those who followed it. No ma er how
many sacriﬁces were oﬀered year a er
year, they never added up to a complete
solu on.
2 If they had, the worshipers would
have gone merrily on their way, no
longer dragged down by their sins.
3 But instead of removing awareness of
sin, when those animal sacriﬁces were
repeated over and over they actually
heightened awareness and guilt.
4 The plain fact is that bull and goat
blood can't get rid of sin.
10HEBREWS 10
32
5 That is what is meant by this prophecy,
put in the mouth of Christ: You don't
want sacriﬁces and oﬀerings year a er
year; you've prepared a body for me for
a sacriﬁce.
6 It's not fragrance and smoke from the
altar that whet your appe te.
7 So I said, "I'm here to do it your way,
O God, the way it's described in your
Book."
8 When he said, "You don't want
sacriﬁces and oﬀerings," he was
referring to prac ces according to the
old plan.
9 When he added, "I'm here to do it
your way," he set aside the ﬁrst in order
to enact the new plan--
10 [God's] way--by which we are made
ﬁt for God by the once-for-all sacriﬁce of
Jesus.
11 Every priest goes to work at the altar
each day, oﬀers the same old sacriﬁcesHEBREWS 10
33
year in, year out, and never makes a
dent in the sin problem.
12 As a priest, Christ made a single
sacriﬁce for sins, and that was it! Then
he sat down right beside God
13 and waited for his enemies to cave
in.
14 It was a perfect sacriﬁce by a perfect
person to perfect some very imperfect
people. By that single oﬀering, he did
everything that needed to be done for
everyone who takes part in the purifying
process.
15 The Holy Spirit conﬁrms this:
16 This new plan I'm making with Israel
isn't going to be wri en on paper, isn't
going to be chiseled in stone; This me
"I'm wri ng out the plan in them, carving
it on the lining of their hearts."
17 He concludes, I'll forever wipe the
slate clean of their sins.HEBREWS 10
34
18 Once sins are taken care of for good,
there's no longer any need to oﬀer
sacriﬁces for them.
19 So, friends, we can now--without
hesita on--walk right up to God, into
"the Holy Place." Jesus has cleared the
way by the blood of his sacriﬁce, ac ng
as our priest before God. The "curtain"
into God's presence is his body.
22 So let's [do] it--full of belief, conﬁdent
that we're presentable inside and out.
23 Let's keep a ﬁrm grip on the promises
that keep us going. He always keeps his
word.
24 Let's see how inven ve we can be in
encouraging love and helping out,
25 not avoiding worshiping together
as some do but spurring each other
on, especially as we see the big Day
approaching.
26 If we give up and turn our backs on
all we've learned, all we've been given,HEBREWS 10
35
all the truth we now know, we repudiate
Christ's sacriﬁce
27 and are le on our own to face the
Judgment--and a mighty ﬁerce judgment
it will be!
28 If the penalty for breaking the law of
Moses is physical death,
29 what do you think will happen if you
turn on God's Son, spit on the sacriﬁce
that made you whole, and insult this
most gracious Spirit?
30 This is no light ma er. God has
warned us that he'll hold us to account
and make us pay. He was quite explicit:
"Vengeance is mine, and I won't
overlook a thing," and, "God will judge
his people."
31 Nobody's ge ng by with anything,
believe me.
32 Remember those early days a er you
ﬁrst saw the light? Those were the hard
mes!HEBREWS 10
36
33 Kicked around in public, targets of
every kind of abuse--some days it was
you, other days your friends.
34 If some friends went to prison, you
stuck by them. If some enemies broke
in and seized your goods, you let them
go with a smile, knowing they couldn't
touch your real treasure. Nothing they
did bothered you, nothing set you back.
35 So don't throw it all away now. You
were sure of yourselves then. It's [s ll] a
sure thing!
36 But you need to s ck it out, staying
with God's plan so you'll be there for the
promised comple on.
37 It won't be long now, he's on the
way; he'll show up most any minute.
38 But anyone who is right with me
thrives on loyal trust; if he cuts and runs,
I won't be very happy.HEBREWS 10 – 11
39 But we're not qui
37
ers who lose out.
Oh, no! We'll stay with it and survive,
trus ng all the way.
1 The fundamental fact of
existence is that this trust in God,
this faith, is the ﬁrm founda on under
everything that makes life worth living.
It's our handle on what we can't see.
2 The act of faith is what dis nguished
our ancestors, set them above the
crowd.
3 By faith, we see the world called into
existence by God's word, what we see
created by what we don't see.
4 By an act of faith, Abel brought a
be er sacriﬁce to God than Cain. It
was what he [believed], not what he
[brought], that made the diﬀerence.
That's what God no ced and approved
as righteous. A er all these centuries,
that belief con nues to catch our no ce.
11HEBREWS 11
38
5 By an act of faith, Enoch skipped
death completely. "They looked all over
and couldn't ﬁnd him because God had
taken him." We know on the basis of
reliable tes mony that before he was
taken "he pleased God."
6 It's impossible to please God apart
from faith. And why? Because anyone
who wants to approach God must
believe both that he exists [and] that he
cares enough to respond to those who
seek him.
7 By faith, Noah built a ship in the
middle of dry land. He was warned
about something he couldn't see, and
acted on what he was told. The result?
His family was saved. His act of faith
drew a sharp line between the evil of
the unbelieving world and the rightness
of the believing world. As a result, Noah
became in mate with God.HEBREWS 11
39
8 By an act of faith, Abraham said yes to
God's call to travel to an unknown place
that would become his home. When he
le he had no idea where he was going.
9 By an act of faith he lived in the
country promised him, lived as a
stranger camping in tents. Isaac and
Jacob did the same, living under the
same promise.
10 Abraham did it by keeping his eye
on an unseen city with real, eternal
founda ons--the City designed and built
by God.
11 By faith, barren Sarah was able to
become pregnant, old woman as she
was at the me, because she believed
the One who made a promise would do
what he said.
12 That's how it happened that from
one man's dead and shriveled loins
there are now people numbering into
the millions.HEBREWS 11
40
13 Each one of these people of faith
died not yet having in hand what was
promised, but s ll believing. How did
they do it? They saw it way oﬀ in
the distance, waved their gree ng,
and accepted the fact that they were
transients in this world.
14 People who live this way make it
plain that they are looking for their true
home.
15 If they were homesick for the old
country, they could have gone back any
me they wanted.
16 But they were a er a far be er
country than that--[heaven] country. You
can see why God is so proud of them,
and has a City wai ng for them.
17 By faith, Abraham, at the me of
tes ng, oﬀered Isaac back to God. Ac ng
in faith, he was as ready to return the
promised son, his only son, as he had
been to receive him--HEBREWS 11
18 and this a
41
er he had already been
told, "Your descendants shall come from
Isaac."
19 Abraham ﬁgured that if God wanted
to, he could raise the dead. In a sense,
that's what happened when he received
Isaac back, alive from oﬀ the altar.
20 By an act of faith, Isaac reached into
the future as he blessed Jacob and Esau.
21 By an act of faith, Jacob on his
deathbed blessed each of Joseph's
sons in turn, blessing them with God's
blessing, not his own--as he bowed
worshipfully upon his staﬀ.
22 By an act of faith, Joseph, while
dying, prophesied the exodus of Israel,
and made arrangements for his own
burial.
23 By an act of faith, Moses' parents
hid him away for three months a er his
birth. They saw the child's beauty, and
they braved the king's decree.HEBREWS 11
42
24 By faith, Moses, when grown,
refused the privileges of the Egyp an
royal house.
25 He chose a hard life with God's
people rather than an opportunis c so
life of sin with the oppressors.
26 He valued suﬀering in the Messiah's
camp far greater than Egyp an
wealth because he was looking ahead,
an cipa ng the payoﬀ.
27 By an act of faith, he turned his heel
on Egypt, indiﬀerent to the king's blind
rage. He had his eye on the One no eye
can see, and kept right on going.
28 By an act of faith, he kept the
Passover Feast and sprinkled Passover
blood on each house so that the
destroyer of the ﬁrstborn wouldn't touch
them.
29 By an act of faith, Israel walked
through the Red Sea on dry ground. The
Egyp ans tried it and drowned.HEBREWS 11
43
30 By faith, the Israelites marched
around the walls of Jericho for seven
days, and the walls fell ﬂat.
31 By an act of faith, Rahab, the Jericho
harlot, welcomed the spies and escaped
the destruc on that came on those who
refused to trust God.
32 I could go on and on, but I've
run out of me. There are so many
more--Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah,
David, Samuel, the prophets. ...
33 Through acts of faith, they toppled
kingdoms, made jus ce work, took the
promises for themselves. They were
protected from lions,
34 ﬁres, and sword thrusts, turned
disadvantage to advantage, won ba les,
routed alien armies.
35 Women received their loved ones
back from the dead. There were those
who, under torture, refused to give inHEBREWS 11 – 12
44
and go free, preferring something be er:
resurrec on.
36 Others braved abuse and whips, and,
yes, chains and dungeons.
37 We have stories of those who were
stoned, sawed in two, murdered in cold
blood; stories of vagrants wandering
the earth in animal skins, homeless,
friendless, powerless--
38 the world didn't deserve them!--
making their way as best they could on
the cruel edges of the world.
39 Not one of these people, even though
their lives of faith were exemplary, got
their hands on what was promised.
40 God had a be er plan for us: that
their faith and our faith would come
together to make one completed whole,
their lives of faith not complete apart
from ours.
1 Do you see what this means--all
these pioneers who blazed the
12HEBREWS 12
45
way, all these veterans cheering us on?
It means we'd be er get on with it. Strip
down, start running--and never quit! No
extra spiritual fat, no parasi c sins.
2 Keep your eyes on [Jesus], who both
began and ﬁnished this race we're in.
Study how he did it. Because he never
lost sight of where he was headed--that
exhilara ng ﬁnish in and with God--he
could put up with anything along the
way: cross, shame, whatever. And now
he's [there], in the place of honor, right
alongside God.
3 When you ﬁnd yourselves ﬂagging
in your faith, go over that story again,
item by item, that long litany of hos lity
he plowed through. [That] will shoot
adrenaline into your souls!
4 In this all-out match against sin, others
have suﬀered far worse than you, to say
nothing of what Jesus went through--all
that bloodshed!HEBREWS 12
46
5 So don't feel sorry for yourselves. Or
have you forgo en how good parents
treat children, and that God regards you
as his children? My dear child, don't
shrug oﬀ God's discipline, but don't be
crushed by it either.
6 It's the child he loves that he
disciplines; the child he embraces, he
also corrects.
7 God is educa ng you; that's why you
must never drop out. He's trea ng you
as dear children. This trouble you're in
isn't punishment; it's [training],
8 the normal experience of children.
Only irresponsible parents leave children
to fend for themselves. Would you prefer
an irresponsible God?
9 We respect our own parents for
training and not spoiling us, so why not
embrace God's training so we can truly
[live]?HEBREWS 12
47
10 While we were children, our parents
did what [seemed] best to them. But
God is doing what is best for us, training
us to live God's holy best.
11 At the me, discipline isn't much
fun. It always feels like it's going against
the grain. Later, of course, it pays oﬀ
handsomely, for it's the well-trained
who ﬁnd themselves mature in their
rela onship with God.
12 So don't sit around on your hands!
No more dragging your feet!
13 Clear the path for long-distance
runners so no one will trip and fall, so
no one will step in a hole and sprain an
ankle. Help each other out. And run for
it!
14 Work at ge ng along with each
other and with God. Otherwise you'll
never get so much as a glimpse of God.
15 Make sure no one gets le out of
God's generosity. Keep a sharp eye outHEBREWS 12
48
for weeds of bi er discontent. A thistle
or two gone to seed can ruin a whole
garden in no me.
16 Watch out for the Esau syndrome:
trading away God's lifelong gi in order
to sa sfy a short-term appe te.
17 You well know how Esau later
regre ed that impulsive act and wanted
God's blessing--but by then it was too
late, tears or no tears.
18 Unlike your ancestors, you didn't
come to Mount Sinai--all that volcanic
blaze and earthshaking rumble--
19 to hear God speak. The earspli ng
words and soul-shaking message
terriﬁed them and they begged him to
stop.
20 When they heard the words--"If
an animal touches the Mountain, it's
as good as dead"--they were afraid to
move.
21 Even Moses was terriﬁed.HEBREWS 12
49
22 No, that's not [your] experience at
all. You've come to Mount Zion, the
city where the living God resides. The
invisible Jerusalem is populated by
throngs of fes ve angels
23 and Chris an ci zens. It is the city
where God is Judge, with judgments that
make us just.
24 You've come to Jesus, who presents
us with a new covenant, a fresh charter
from God. He is the Mediator of this
covenant. The murder of Jesus, unlike
Abel's--a homicide that cried out for
vengeance--became a proclama on of
grace.
25 So don't turn a deaf ear to these
gracious words. If those who ignored
earthly warnings didn't get away with
it, what will happen to us if we turn our
backs on heavenly warnings?
26 His voice that me shook the earth
to its founda ons; this me--he's toldHEBREWS 12 – 13
50
us this quite plainly--he'll also rock the
heavens: "One last shaking, from top to
bo om, stem to stern."
27 The phrase "one last shaking" means
a thorough housecleaning, ge ng rid
of all the historical and religious junk
so that the unshakable essen als stand
clear and unclu ered.
28 Do you see what we've got? An
unshakable kingdom! And do you see
how thankful we must be? Not only
thankful, but brimming with worship,
deeply reverent before God. For God is
not an indiﬀerent bystander.
29 He's ac vely cleaning house, torching
all that needs to burn, and he won't quit
un l it's all cleansed. God himself is Fire!
1 Stay on good terms with each
other, held together by love.
2 Be ready with a meal or a bed when
it's needed. Why, some have extended
13HEBREWS 13
51
hospitality to angels without ever
knowing it!
3 Regard prisoners as if you were in
prison with them. Look on vic ms of
abuse as if what happened to them had
happened to you.
4 Honor marriage, and guard the
sacredness of sexual in macy between
wife and husband. God draws a ﬁrm line
against casual and illicit sex.
5 Don't be obsessed with ge ng more
material things. Be relaxed with what
you have. Since God assured us, "I'll
never let you down, never walk oﬀ and
leave you,"
6 we can boldly quote, God is there,
ready to help; I'm fearless no ma er
what. Who or what can get to me?
7 Appreciate your pastoral leaders who
gave you the Word of God. Take a good
look at the way they live, and let their
faithfulness instruct you, as well asHEBREWS 13
52
their truthfulness. There should be a
consistency that runs through us all.
8 For Jesus doesn't change--yesterday,
today, tomorrow, he's always totally
himself.
9 Don't be lured away from him by the
latest specula ons about him. The grace
of Christ is the only good ground for life.
Products named a er Christ don't seem
to do much for those who buy them.
10 The altar from which God gives us
the gi of himself is not for exploita on
by insiders who grab and loot.
11 In the old system, the animals are
killed and the bodies disposed of outside
the camp. The blood is then brought
inside to the altar as a sacriﬁce for sin.
12 It's the same with Jesus. He was
cruciﬁed outside the city gates--[that]
is where he poured out the sacriﬁcial
blood that was brought to God's altar to
cleanse his people.HEBREWS 13
53
13 So let's go outside, where Jesus is,
where the ac on is--not trying to be
privileged insiders, but taking our share
in the abuse of Jesus.
14 This "insider world" is not our home.
We have our eyes peeled for the City
about to come.
15 Let's take our place outside with
Jesus, no longer pouring out the
sacriﬁcial blood of animals but pouring
out sacriﬁcial praises from our lips to
God in Jesus' name.
16 Make sure you don't take things
for granted and go slack in working
for the common good; share what you
have with others. God takes par cular
pleasure in acts of worship--a diﬀerent
kind of "sacriﬁce"--that take place in
kitchen and workplace and on the
streets.
17 Be responsive to your pastoral
leaders. Listen to their counsel. They areHEBREWS 13
54
alert to the condi on of your lives and
work under the strict supervision of God.
Contribute to the joy of their leadership,
not its drudgery. Why would you want to
make things harder for them?
18 Pray for us. We have no doubts about
what we're doing or why, but it's hard
going and we need your prayers. All we
care about is living well before God.
19 Pray that we may be together soon.
20 May God, who puts all things
together, makes all things whole,
Who made a las ng mark through the
sacriﬁce of Jesus, the sacriﬁce of blood
that sealed the eternal covenant, Who
led Jesus, our Great Shepherd, up and
alive from the dead,
21 Now put you together, provide you
with everything you need to please
him, Make us into what gives him most
pleasure, by means of the sacriﬁce ofHEBREWS 13
55
Jesus, the Messiah. All glory to Jesus
forever and always! Oh, yes, yes, yes.
22 Friends, please take what I've wri en
most seriously. I've kept this as brief
as possible; I haven't piled on a lot of
extras.
23 You'll be glad to know that Timothy
has been let out of prison. If he leaves
soon, I'll come with him and get to see
you myself.
24 Say hello to your pastoral leaders and
all the congrega ons. Everyone here in
Italy wants to be remembered to you.
25 Grace be with you, every one.James
1
1 I, James, am a slave of God and the
Master Jesus, wri ng to the twelve
tribes sca ered to Kingdom Come:
Hello!
2 Consider it a sheer gi , friends, when
tests and challenges come at you from
all sides.
3 You know that under pressure, your
faith-life is forced into the open and
shows its true colors.
4 So don't try to get out of anything
prematurely. Let it do its work so you
become mature and well-developed, not
deﬁcient in any way.
5 If you don't know what you're doing,
pray to the Father. He loves to help. You'll
get his help, and won't be condescended
to when you ask for it.JAMES 1
2
6 Ask boldly, believingly, without a
second thought. People who "worry
their prayers" are like wind-whipped
waves.
7 Don't think you're going to get
anything from the Master that way,
8 adri at sea, keeping all your op ons
open.
9 When down-and-outers get a break,
cheer!
10 And when the arrogant rich are
brought down to size, cheer! Prosperity
is as short-lived as a wildﬂower, so don't
ever count on it.
11 You know that as soon as the sun
rises, pouring down its scorching heat,
the ﬂower withers. Its petals wilt and,
before you know it, that beau ful face
is a barren stem. Well, that's a picture
of the "prosperous life." At the very
moment everyone is looking on in
admira on, it fades away to nothing.JAMES 1
12 Anyone who meets a tes
3
ng
challenge head-on and manages to
s ck it out is mighty fortunate. For such
persons loyally in love with God, the
reward is life and more life.
13 Don't let anyone under pressure to
give in to evil say, "God is trying to trip
me up." God is impervious to evil, and
puts evil in no one's way.
14 The tempta on to give in to evil
comes from us and only us. We have no
one to blame but the leering, seducing
ﬂare-up of our own lust.
15 Lust gets pregnant, and has a baby:
sin! Sin grows up to adulthood, and
becomes a real killer.
16 So, my very dear friends, don't get
thrown oﬀ course.
17 Every desirable and beneﬁcial gi
comes out of heaven. The gi s are rivers
of light cascading down from the FatherJAMES 1
4
of Light. There is nothing decei ul in
God, nothing two-faced, nothing ﬁckle.
18 He brought us to life using the true
Word, showing us oﬀ as the crown of all
his creatures.
19 Post this at all the intersec ons, dear
friends: Lead with your ears, follow up
with your tongue, and let anger straggle
along in the rear.
20 God's righteousness doesn't grow
from human anger.
21 So throw all spoiled virtue and
cancerous evil in the garbage. In
simple humility, let our gardener, God,
landscape you with the Word, making a
salva on-garden of your life.
22 Don't fool yourself into thinking that
you are a listener when you are anything
but, le ng the Word go in one ear and
out the other. Act on what you hear!
23 Those who hear and don't act are like
those who glance in the mirror,JAMES 1 – 2
5
24 walk away, and two minutes later
have no idea who they are, what they
look like.
25 But whoever catches a glimpse of
the revealed counsel of God--the free
life!--even out of the corner of his
eye, and s cks with it, is no distracted
sca erbrain but a man or woman of
ac on. That person will ﬁnd delight and
aﬃrma on in the ac on.
26 Anyone who sets himself up as
"religious" by talking a good game is
self-deceived. This kind of religion is hot
air and only hot air.
27 Real religion, the kind that passes
muster before God the Father, is this:
Reach out to the homeless and loveless
in their plight, and guard against
corrup on from the godless world.
1 My dear friends, don't let public
opinion inﬂuence how you live out
our glorious, Christ-originated faith.
2JAMES 2
6
2 If a man enters your church wearing
an expensive suit, and a street person
wearing rags comes in right a er him,
3 and you say to the man in the suit,
"Sit here, sir; this is the best seat in the
house!" and either ignore the street
person or say, "Be er sit here in the back
row,"
4 haven't you segregated God's children
and proved that you are judges who
can't be trusted?
5 Listen, dear friends. Isn't it clear by
now that God operates quite diﬀerently?
He chose the world's down-and-out as
the kingdom's ﬁrst ci zens, with full
rights and privileges. This kingdom is
promised to anyone who loves God.
6 And here you are abusing these same
ci zens! Isn't it the high and mighty who
exploit you, who use the courts to rob
you blind?JAMES 2
7
7 Aren't they the ones who scorn the
new name--"Chris an"--used in your
bap sms?
8 You do well when you complete the
Royal Rule of the Scriptures: "Love
others as you love yourself."
9 But if you play up to these so-called
important people, you go against the
Rule and stand convicted by it.
10 You can't pick and choose in these
things, specializing in keeping one or two
things in God's law and ignoring others.
11 The same God who said, "Don't
commit adultery," also said, "Don't
murder." If you don't commit adultery
but go ahead and murder, do you think
your non-adultery will cancel out your
murder? No, you're a murderer, period.
12 Talk and act like a person expec ng
to be judged by the Rule that sets us
free.JAMES 2
8
13 For if you refuse to act kindly, you
can hardly expect to be treated kindly.
Kind mercy wins over harsh judgment
every me.
14 Dear friends, do you think you'll get
anywhere in this if you learn all the right
words but never do anything? Does
merely talking about faith indicate that a
person really has it?
15 For instance, you come upon an old
friend dressed in rags and half-starved
16 and say, "Good morning, friend! Be
clothed in Christ! Be ﬁlled with the Holy
Spirit!" and walk oﬀ without providing so
much as a coat or a cup of soup--where
does that get you?
17 Isn't it obvious that God-talk without
God-acts is outrageous nonsense?
18 I can already hear one of you
agreeing by saying, "Sounds good. You
take care of the faith department, I'll
handle the works department." Not soJAMES 2
9
fast. You can no more show me your
works apart from your faith than I can
show you my faith apart from my works.
Faith and works, works and faith, ﬁt
together hand in glove.
19 Do I hear you professing to believe in
the one and only God, but then observe
you complacently si ng back as if you
had done something wonderful? That's
just great. Demons do that, but what
good does it do them?
20 Use your heads! Do you suppose
for a minute that you can cut faith and
works in two and not end up with a
corpse on your hands?
21 Wasn't our ancestor Abraham "made
right with God by works" when he placed
his son Isaac on the sacriﬁcial altar?
22 Isn't it obvious that faith and works
are yoked partners, that faith expresses
itself in works? That the works are
"works of faith"?JAMES 2 – 3
10
23 The full meaning of "believe" in the
Scripture sentence, "Abraham believed
God and was set right with God,"
includes his ac on. It's that mesh of
believing and ac ng that got Abraham
named "God's friend."
24 Is it not evident that a person is made
right with God not by a barren faith but
by faith frui ul in works?
25 The same with Rahab, the Jericho
harlot. Wasn't her ac on in hiding
God's spies and helping them escape-
-that seamless unity of believing and
[doing]--what counted with God?
26 The very moment you separate body
and spirit, you end up with a corpse.
Separate faith and works and you get
the same thing: a corpse.
1 Don't be in any rush to become
a teacher, my friends. Teaching is
highly responsible work. Teachers are
held to the strictest standards.
3JAMES 3
11
2 And none of us is perfectly qualiﬁed.
We get it wrong nearly every me we
open our mouths. If you could ﬁnd
someone whose speech was perfectly
true, you'd have a perfect person, in
perfect control of life.
3 A bit in the mouth of a horse controls
the whole horse.
4 A small rudder on a huge ship in the
hands of a skilled captain sets a course
in the face of the strongest winds.
5 A word out of your mouth may seem
of no account, but it can accomplish
nearly anything--or destroy it! It only
takes a spark, remember, to set oﬀ a
forest ﬁre.
6 A careless or wrongly placed word
out of your mouth can do that. By our
speech we can ruin the world, turn
harmony to chaos, throw mud on a
reputa on, send the whole world up inJAMES 3
12
smoke and go up in smoke with it, smoke
right from the pit of hell.
7 This is scary: You can tame a ger,
8 but you can't tame a tongue--it's
never been done. The tongue runs wild,
a wanton killer.
9 With our tongues we bless God our
Father; with the same tongues we curse
the very men and women he made in his
image.
10 Curses and blessings out of the same
mouth! My friends, this can't go on.
11 A spring doesn't gush fresh water
one day and brackish the next, does it?
12 Apple trees don't bear strawberries,
do they? Raspberry bushes don't bear
apples, do they? You're not going to dip
into a polluted mud hole and get a cup
of clear, cool water, are you?
13 Do you want to be counted wise, to
build a reputa on for wisdom? Here's
what you do: Live well, live wisely, liveJAMES 3
13
humbly. It's the way you live, not the
way you talk, that counts.
14 Mean-spirited ambi on isn't wisdom.
Boas ng that you are wise isn't wisdom.
Twis ng the truth to make yourselves
sound wise isn't wisdom.
15 It's the furthest thing from wisdom--
it's animal cunning, devilish conniving.
16 Whenever you're trying to look
be er than others or get the be er of
others, things fall apart and everyone
ends up at the others' throats.
17 Real wisdom, God's wisdom, begins
with a holy life and is characterized by
ge ng along with others. It is gentle and
reasonable, overﬂowing with mercy and
blessings, not hot one day and cold the
next, not two-faced.
18 You can develop a healthy, robust
community that lives right with God and
enjoy its results only if you do the hard
work of ge ng along with each other,JAMES 4
14
trea ng each other with dignity and
honor.
1 Where do you think all these
appalling wars and quarrels come
from? Do you think they just happen?
Think again. They come about because
you want your own way, and ﬁght for it
deep inside yourselves.
2 You lust for what you don't have and
are willing to kill to get it. You want what
isn't yours and will risk violence to get
your hands on it. You wouldn't think of
just asking God for it, would you?
3 And why not? Because you know
you'd be asking for what you have no
right to. You're spoiled children, each
wan ng your own way.
4 You're chea ng on God. If all you
want is your own way, ﬂir ng with the
world every chance you get, you end up
enemies of God and his way.
4JAMES 4
15
5 And do you suppose God doesn't
care? The proverb has it that "he's a
ﬁercely jealous lover."
6 And what he gives in love is far
be er than anything else you'll ﬁnd.
It's common knowledge that "God goes
against the willful proud; God gives grace
to the willing humble."
7 So let God work his will in you. Yell
a loud [no] to the Devil and watch him
scamper.
8 Say a quiet yes to God and he'll be
there in no me. Quit dabbling in sin.
Purify your inner life. Quit playing the
ﬁeld.
9 Hit bo om, and cry your eyes out.
The fun and games are over. Get serious,
really serious.
10 Get down on your knees before the
Master; it's the only way you'll get on
your feet.JAMES 4
16
11 Don't bad-mouth each other, friends.
It's God's Word, his Message, his Royal
Rule, that takes a bea ng in that kind of
talk. You're supposed to be honoring the
Message, not wri ng graﬃ all over it.
12 God is in charge of deciding human
des ny. Who do you think you are to
meddle in the des ny of others?
13 And now I have a word for you who
brashly announce, "Today--at the latest,
tomorrow--we're oﬀ to such and such a
city for the year. We're going to start a
business and make a lot of money."
14 You don't know the ﬁrst thing about
tomorrow. You're nothing but a wisp of
fog, catching a brief bit of sun before
disappearing.
15 Instead, make it a habit to say, "If the
Master wills it and we're s ll alive, we'll
do this or that."JAMES 4 – 5
17
16 As it is, you are full of your grandiose
selves. All such vaun ng self-importance
is evil.
17 In fact, if you know the right thing to
do and don't do it, that, for you, [is] evil.
1 And a ﬁnal word to you arrogant
rich: Take some lessons in lament.
You'll need buckets for the tears when
the crash comes upon you.
2 Your money is corrupt and your ﬁne
clothes s nk.
3 Your greedy luxuries are a cancer
in your gut, destroying your life from
within. You thought you were piling
up wealth. What you've piled up is
judgment.
4 All the workers you've exploited and
cheated cry out for judgment. The
groans of the workers you used and
abused are a roar in the ears of the
Master Avenger.
5JAMES 5
18
5 You've looted the earth and lived it
up. But all you'll have to show for it is a
fa er than usual corpse.
6 In fact, what you've done is condemn
and murder perfectly good persons, who
stand there and take it.
7 Meanwhile, friends, wait pa ently for
the Master's Arrival. You see farmers
do this all the me, wai ng for their
valuable crops to mature, pa ently
le ng the rain do its slow but sure work.
8 Be pa ent like that. Stay steady and
strong. The Master could arrive at any
me.
9 Friends, don't complain about each
other. A far greater complaint could be
lodged against you, you know. The Judge
is standing just around the corner.
10 Take the old prophets as your
mentors. They put up with anything,
went through everything, and never
once quit, all the me honoring God.JAMES 5
11 What a gi
19
life is to those who stay
the course! You've heard, of course, of
Job's staying power, and you know how
God brought it all together for him at
the end. That's because God cares, cares
right down to the last detail.
12 And since you know that he cares,
let your language show it. Don't add
words like "I swear to God" to your own
words. Don't show your impa ence by
concoc ng oaths to hurry up God. Just
say yes or no. Just say what is true. That
way, your language can't be used against
you.
13 Are you hur ng? Pray. Do you feel
great? Sing.
14 Are you sick? Call the church leaders
together to pray and anoint you with oil
in the name of the Master.
15 Believing-prayer will heal you, and
Jesus will put you on your feet. And ifJAMES 5
20
you've sinned, you'll be forgiven--healed
inside and out.
16 Make this your common prac ce:
Confess your sins to each other and
pray for each other so that you can
live together whole and healed. The
prayer of a person living right with God
is something powerful to be reckoned
with.
17 Elijah, for instance, human just like
us, prayed hard that it wouldn't rain, and
it didn't--not a drop for three and a half
years.
18 Then he prayed that it would rain,
and it did. The showers came and
everything started growing again.
19 My dear friends, if you know people
who have wandered oﬀ from God's
truth, don't write them oﬀ. Go a er
them. Get them backJAMES 5
21
20 and you will have rescued precious
lives from destruc on and prevented an
epidemic of wandering away from God.1 Peter
1
1 I, Peter, am an apostle on
assignment by Jesus, the Messiah,
wri ng to exiles sca ered to the four
winds. Not one is missing, not one
forgo en.
2 God the Father has his eye on each of
you, and has determined by the work of
the Spirit to keep you obedient through
the sacriﬁce of Jesus. May everything
good from God be yours!
3 What a God we have! And how
fortunate we are to have him, this Father
of our Master Jesus! Because Jesus was
raised from the dead, we've been given
a brand-new life and have everything to
live for,
4 including a future in heaven--and the
future starts now!1 PETER 1
2
5 God is keeping careful watch over us
and the future. The Day is coming when
you'll have it all--life healed and whole.
6 I know how great this makes you
feel, even though you have to put up
with every kind of aggrava on in the
mean me.
7 Pure gold put in the ﬁre comes
out of it [proved] pure; genuine faith
put through this suﬀering comes out
[proved] genuine. When Jesus wraps this
all up, it's your faith, not your gold, that
God will have on display as evidence of
his victory.
8 You never saw him, yet you love him.
You s ll don't see him, yet you trust
him--with laughter and singing.
9 Because you kept on believing, you'll
get what you're looking forward to: total
salva on.1 PETER 1
3
10 The prophets who told us this was
coming asked a lot of ques ons about
this gi of life God was preparing.
11 The Messiah's Spirit let them in on
some of it--that the Messiah would
experience suﬀering, followed by glory.
They clamored to know who and when.
12 All they were told was that they
were serving you, you who by orders
from heaven have now heard for
yourselves--through the Holy Spirit--the
Message of those prophecies fulﬁlled.
Do you realize how fortunate you are?
Angels would have given anything to be
in on this!
13 So roll up your sleeves, put your mind
in gear, be totally ready to receive the
gi that's coming when Jesus arrives.
14 Don't lazily slip back into those old
grooves of evil, doing just what you feel
like doing. You didn't know any be er
then; you do now.1 PETER 1
4
15 As obedient children, let yourselves
be pulled into a way of life shaped by
God's life, a life energe c and blazing
with holiness.
16 God said, "I am holy; you be holy."
17 You call out to God for help and he
helps--he's a good Father that way. But
don't forget, he's also a responsible
Father, and won't let you get by with
sloppy living. Your life is a journey you
must travel with a deep consciousness
of God.
18 It cost God plenty to get you out of
that dead-end, empty-headed life you
grew up in.
19 He paid with Christ's sacred blood,
you know. He died like an unblemished,
sacriﬁcial lamb.
20 And this was no a erthought. Even
though it has only lately--at the end of
the ages--become public knowledge,1 PETER 1
5
God always knew he was going to do this
for you.
21 It's because of this sacriﬁced
Messiah, whom God then raised from
the dead and gloriﬁed, that you trust
God, that you know you have a future in
God.
22 Now that you've cleaned up your
lives by following the truth, love one
another as if your lives depended on it.
23 Your new life is not like your old life.
Your old birth came from mortal sperm;
your new birth comes from God's living
Word. Just think: a life conceived by God
himself!
24 That's why the prophet said, The old
life is a grass life, its beauty as short-lived
as wildﬂowers; Grass dries up, ﬂowers
droop,
25 God's Word goes on and on forever.
This is the Word that conceived the new
life in you.1 PETER 2
2
6
1 So clean house! Make a clean
sweep of malice and pretense, envy
and hur ul talk.
2 Now, like infants at the breast, drink
deep of God's pure kindness. Then you'll
grow up mature and whole in God.
3 You've had a taste of God.
4 Welcome to the living Stone, the
source of life. The workmen took one
look and threw it out; God set it in the
place of honor.
5 Present yourselves as building stones
for the construc on of a sanctuary
vibrant with life, in which you'll serve
as holy priests oﬀering Christ-approved
lives up to God.
6 The Scriptures provide precedent:
Look! I'm se ng a stone in Zion, a
cornerstone in the place of honor.
Whoever trusts in this stone as a
founda on will never have cause to
regret it.1 PETER 2
7
7 To you who trust him, he's a Stone to
be proud of, but to those who refuse to
trust him, The stone the workmen threw
out is now the chief founda on stone.
8 For the untrus ng it's...a stone to trip
over, a boulder blocking the way. They
trip and fall because they refuse to obey,
just as predicted.
9 But you are the ones chosen by God,
chosen for the high calling of priestly
work, chosen to be a holy people,
God's instruments to do his work and
speak out for him, to tell others of the
night-and-day diﬀerence he made for
you--
10 from nothing to something, from
rejected to accepted.
11 Friends, this world is not your home,
so don't make yourselves cozy in it. Don't
indulge your ego at the expense of your
soul.1 PETER 2
8
12 Live an exemplary life among the
na ves so that your ac ons will refute
their prejudices. Then they'll be won
over to God's side and be there to join in
the celebra on when he arrives.
13 Make the Master proud of you
by being good ci zens. Respect the
authori es, whatever their level;
14 they are God's emissaries for keeping
order.
15 It is God's will that by doing good,
you might cure the ignorance of the fools
who think you're a danger to society.
16 Exercise your freedom by serving
God, not by breaking the rules.
17 Treat everyone you meet with
dignity. Love your spiritual family. Revere
God. Respect the government.
18 You who are servants, be good
servants to your masters--not just to
good masters, but also to bad ones.1 PETER 2
9
19 What counts is that you put up with
it for God's sake when you're treated
badly for no good reason.
20 There's no par cular virtue in
accep ng punishment that you well
deserve. But if you're treated badly for
good behavior and con nue in spite of it
to be a good servant, that is what counts
with God.
21 This is the kind of life you've been
invited into, the kind of life Christ lived.
He suﬀered everything that came his
way so you would know that it could
be done, and also know how to do it,
step-by-step.
22 He never did one thing wrong, Not
once said anything amiss.
23 They called him every name in the
book and he said nothing back. He
suﬀered in silence, content to let God
set things right.1 PETER 2 – 3
10
24 He used his servant body to carry our
sins to the Cross so we could be rid of
sin, free to live the right way. His wounds
became your healing.
25 You were lost sheep with no idea
who you were or where you were going.
Now you're named and kept for good by
the Shepherd of your souls.
1 The same goes for you wives:
Be good wives to your husbands,
responsive to their needs. There are
husbands who, indiﬀerent as they are to
any words about God, will be cap vated
2 by your life of holy beauty.
3 What ma ers is not your outer
appearance--the styling of your hair,
the jewelry you wear, the cut of your
clothes--
4 but your inner disposi on. Cul vate
inner beauty, the gentle, gracious kind
that God delights in.
31 PETER 3
5 The holy women of old were beau
11
ful
before God that way, and were good,
loyal wives to their husbands.
6 Sarah, for instance, taking care of
Abraham, would address him as "my
dear husband." You'll be true daughters
of Sarah if you do the same, unanxious
and unin midated.
7 The same goes for you husbands: Be
good husbands to your wives. Honor
them, delight in them. As women they
lack some of your advantages. But in the
new life of God's grace, you're equals.
Treat your wives, then, as equals so your
prayers don't run aground.
8 Summing up: Be agreeable,
be sympathe c, be loving, be
compassionate, be humble.
9 That goes for all of you, no excep ons.
No retalia on. No sharp-tongued
sarcasm. Instead, bless--that's your job,1 PETER 3
12
to bless. You'll be a blessing and also get
a blessing.
10 Whoever wants to embrace life and
see the day ﬁll up with good, Here's
what you do: Say nothing evil or hur ul;
11 Snub evil and cul vate good; run
a er peace for all you're worth.
12 God looks on all this with approval,
listening and responding well to what
he's asked; But he turns his back on
those who do evil things.
13 If with heart and soul you're doing
good, do you think you can be stopped?
14 Even if you suﬀer for it, you're s ll
be er oﬀ. Don't give the opposi on a
second thought.
15 Through thick and thin, keep your
hearts at a en on, in adora on before
Christ, your Master. Be ready to speak
up and tell anyone who asks why you're
living the way you are, and always with
the utmost courtesy.1 PETER 3
13
16 Keep a clear conscience before God
so that when people throw mud at
you, none of it will s ck. They'll end up
realizing that [they're] the ones who
need a bath.
17 It's be er to suﬀer for doing good,
if that's what God wants, than to be
punished for doing bad.
18 That's what Christ did deﬁni vely:
suﬀered because of others' sins, the
Righteous One for the unrighteous ones.
He went through it all--was put to death
and then made alive--to bring us to God.
19 He went and proclaimed God's
salva on to earlier genera ons who
ended up in the prison of judgment
20 because they wouldn't listen. You
know, even though God waited pa ently
all the days that Noah built his ship,
only a few were saved then, eight to be
exact--saved [from] the water [by] the
water.1 PETER 3 – 4
21 The waters of bap
14
sm do that for
you, not by washing away dirt from
your skin but by presen ng you through
Jesus' resurrec on before God with a
clear conscience.
22 Jesus has the last word on everything
and everyone, from angels to armies.
He's standing right alongside God, and
what he says goes.
1 Since Jesus went through
everything you're going through and
more, learn to think like him. Think of
your suﬀerings as a weaning from that
old sinful habit of always expec ng to
get your own way.
2 Then you'll be able to live out your
days free to pursue what God wants
instead of being tyrannized by what you
want.
3 You've already put in your me in that
God-ignorant way of life, partying night
41 PETER 4
15
a er night, a drunken and proﬂigate life.
Now it's me to be done with it for good.
4 Of course, your old friends don't
understand why you don't join in with
the old gang anymore. But you don't
have to give an account to them.
5 They're the ones who will be called on
the carpet--and before God himself.
6 Listen to the Message. It was preached
to those believers who are now dead,
and yet even though they died (just as
all people must), they will s ll get in on
the [life] that God has given in Jesus.
7 Everything in the world is about to be
wrapped up, so take nothing for granted.
Stay wide-awake in prayer.
8 Most of all, love each other as if your
life depended on it. Love makes up for
prac cally anything.
9 Be quick to give a meal to the hungry,
a bed to the homeless--cheerfully.1 PETER 4
16
10 Be generous with the diﬀerent things
God gave you, passing them around so
all get in on it:
11 if words, let it be God's words; if help,
let it be God's hearty help. That way,
God's bright presence will be evident
in everything through Jesus, and [he'll]
get all the credit as the One mighty in
everything--encores to the end of me.
Oh, yes!
12 Friends, when life gets really diﬃcult,
don't jump to the conclusion that God
isn't on the job.
13 Instead, be glad that you are in the
very thick of what Christ experienced.
This is a spiritual reﬁning process, with
glory just around the corner.
14 If you're abused because of Christ,
count yourself fortunate. It's the Spirit
of God and his glory in you that brought
you to the no ce of others.1 PETER 4 – 5
17
15 If they're on you because you broke
the law or disturbed the peace, that's a
diﬀerent ma er.
16 But if it's because you're a Chris an,
don't give it a second thought. Be proud
of the dis nguished status reﬂected in
that name!
17 It's judgment me for Chris ans.
We're ﬁrst in line. If it starts with us,
think what it's going to be like for those
who refuse God's Message!
18 If good people barely make it, What's
in store for the bad?
19 So if you ﬁnd life diﬃcult because
you're doing what God said, take it in
stride. Trust him. He knows what he's
doing, and he'll keep on doing it.
1 I have a special concern for you
church leaders. I know what it's like
to be a leader, in on Christ's suﬀerings as
well as the coming glory.
51 PETER 5
18
2 Here's my concern: that you care for
God's ﬂock with all the diligence of a
shepherd. Not because you have to, but
because you want to please God. Not
calcula ng what you can get out of it,
but ac ng spontaneously.
3 Not bossily telling others what to do,
but tenderly showing them the way.
4 When God, who is the best shepherd
of all, comes out in the open with his
rule, he'll see that you've done it right
and commend you lavishly.
5 And you who are younger must follow
your leaders. But all of you, leaders and
followers alike, are to be down to earth
with each other, for--God has had it with
the proud, But takes delight in just plain
people.
6 So be content with who you are, and
don't put on airs. God's strong hand is on
you; he'll promote you at the right me.1 PETER 5
19
7 Live carefree before God; he is most
careful with you.
8 Keep a cool head. Stay alert. The
Devil is poised to pounce, and would
like nothing be er than to catch you
napping.
9 Keep your guard up. You're not the
only ones plunged into these hard mes.
It's the same with Chris ans all over the
world. So keep a ﬁrm grip on the faith.
10 The suﬀering won't last forever. It
won't be long before this generous
God who has great plans for us in
Christ--eternal and glorious plans they
are!--will have you put together and on
your feet for good.
11 He gets the last word; yes, he does.
12 I'm sending this brief le er to you
by Silas, a most dependable brother.
I have the highest regard for him. I've
wri en as urgently and accurately as I1 PETER 5
20
know how. This is God's generous truth;
embrace it with both arms!
13 The church in exile here with
me--but not for a moment forgo en by
God--wants to be remembered to you.
Mark, who is like a son to me, says hello.
14 Give holy embraces all around! Peace
to you--to all who walk in Christ's ways.2 Peter
1
1 I, Simon Peter, am a servant and
apostle of Jesus Christ. I write this
to you whose experience with God is as
life-changing as ours, all due to our God's
straight dealing and the interven on of
our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
2 Grace and peace to you many mes
over as you deepen in your experience
with God and Jesus, our Master.
3 Everything that goes into a life of
pleasing God has been miraculously
given to us by ge ng to know, personally
and in mately, the One who invited
us to God. The best invita on we ever
received!
4 We were also given absolutely terriﬁc
promises to pass on to you--your
ckets to par cipa on in the life of God2 PETER 1
2
a er you turned your back on a world
corrupted by lust.
5 So don't lose a minute in building on
what you've been given, complemen ng
your basic faith with good character,
spiritual understanding,
6 alert discipline, passionate pa ence,
reverent wonder,
7 warm friendliness, and generous
love, each dimension ﬁ ng into and
developing the others.
8 With these quali es ac ve and
growing in your lives, no grass will
grow under your feet, no day will pass
without its reward as you mature in your
experience of our Master Jesus.
9 Without these quali es you can't see
what's right before you, oblivious that
your old sinful life has been wiped oﬀ
the books.
10 So, friends, conﬁrm God's invita on
to you, his choice of you. Don't put it oﬀ;2 PETER 1
3
do it now. Do this, and you'll have your
life on a ﬁrm foo ng,
11 the streets paved and the way wide
open into the eternal kingdom of our
Master and Savior, Jesus Christ.
12 Because the stakes are so high, even
though you're up-to-date on all this
truth and prac ce it inside and out, I'm
not going to let up for a minute in calling
you to a en on before it.
13 This is the post to which I've been
assigned--keeping you alert with
frequent reminders--and I'm s cking to
it as long as I live.
14 I know that I'm to die soon; the
Master has made that quite clear to me.
15 And so I am especially eager that you
have all this down in black and white so
that a er I die, you'll have it for ready
reference.
16 We weren't, you know, just wishing
on a star when we laid the facts out2 PETER 1
4
before you regarding the powerful
return of our Master, Jesus Christ. We
were there for the preview! We saw it
with our own eyes:
17 Jesus resplendent with light from
God the Father as the voice of Majes c
Glory spoke: "This is my Son, marked by
my love, focus of all my delight."
18 We were there on the holy mountain
with him. We heard the voice out of
heaven with our very own ears.
19 We couldn't be more sure of what
we saw and heard--[God's] glory,
[God's] voice. The prophe c Word was
conﬁrmed to us. You'll do well to keep
focusing on it. It's the one light you have
in a dark me as you wait for daybreak
and the rising of the Morning Star in
your hearts.
20 The main thing to keep in mind here
is that no prophecy of Scripture is a
ma er of private opinion.2 PETER 1 – 2
5
21 And why? Because it's not something
concocted in the human heart. Prophecy
resulted when the Holy Spirit prompted
men and women to speak God's Word.
1 But there were also [lying] prophets
among the people then, just as there
will be lying religious teachers among
you. They'll smuggle in destruc ve
divisions, pi ng you against each
other--bi ng the hand of the One who
gave them a chance to have their lives
back! They've put themselves on a fast
downhill slide to destruc on,
2 but not before they recruit a crowd of
mixed-up followers who can't tell right
from wrong. They give the way of truth a
bad name.
3 They're only out for themselves.
They'll say anything, [anything], that
sounds good to exploit you. They won't,
of course, get by with it. They'll come to
22 PETER 2
6
a bad end, for God has never just stood
by and let that kind of thing go on.
4 God didn't let the rebel angels oﬀ
the hook, but jailed them in hell ll
Judgment Day.
5 Neither did he let the ancient ungodly
world oﬀ. He wiped it out with a ﬂood,
rescuing only eight people--Noah, the
sole voice of righteousness, was one of
them.
6 God decreed destruc on for the ci es
of Sodom and Gomorrah. A mound of
ashes was all that was le --grim warning
to anyone bent on an ungodly life.
7 But that good man Lot, driven nearly
out of his mind by the sexual ﬁlth and
perversity, was rescued.
8 Surrounded by moral rot day a er
day a er day, that righteous man was in
constant torment.
9 So God knows how to rescue the
godly from evil trials. And he knows how2 PETER 2
7
to hold the feet of the wicked to the ﬁre
un l Judgment Day.
10 God is especially incensed against
these "teachers" who live by lust,
addicted to a ﬁlthy existence. They
despise interference from true authority,
preferring to indulge in self-rule. Insolent
ego sts, they don't hesitate to speak evil
against the most splendid of creatures.
11 Even angels, their superiors in every
way, wouldn't think of throwing their
weight around like that, trying to slander
others before God.
12 These people are nothing but brute
beasts, born in the wild, predators on the
prowl. In the very act of bringing down
others with their ignorant blasphemies,
they themselves will be brought down,
losers in the end.
13 Their evil will boomerang on them.
They're so despicable and addicted2 PETER 2
8
to pleasure that they indulge in wild
par es, carousing in broad daylight.
14 They're obsessed with adultery,
compulsive in sin, seducing every
vulnerable soul they come upon. Their
specialty is greed, and they're experts at
it. Dead souls!
15 They've le the main road and are
direc onless, having taken the way of
Balaam, son of Beor, the prophet who
turned proﬁteer, a connoisseur of evil.
16 But Balaam was stopped in his
wayward tracks: A dumb animal spoke
in a human voice and prevented the
prophet's craziness.
17 There's nothing to these people-
-they're dried-up fountains, storm-
sca ered clouds, headed for a black hole
in hell.
18 They are loudmouths, full of hot air,
but s ll they're dangerous. Men and
women who have recently escaped from2 PETER 2 – 3
9
a deviant life are most suscep ble to
their brand of seduc on.
19 They promise these newcomers
freedom, but they themselves are slaves
of corrup on, for if they're addicted
to corrup on--and they are--they're
[enslaved].
20 If they've escaped from the slum
of sin by experiencing our Master and
Savior, Jesus Christ, and then slid back
into that same old life again, they're
worse than if they had never le .
21 Be er not to have started out on
the straight road to God than to start
out and then turn back, repudia ng the
experience and the holy command.
22 They prove the point of the proverbs,
"A dog goes back to its own vomit," and,
"A scrubbed-up pig heads for the mud."
1 My dear friends, this is now the
second me I've wri en to you, both
32 PETER 3
10
le ers reminders to hold your minds in a
state of undistracted a en on.
2 Keep in mind what the holy prophets
said, and the command of our Master
and Savior that was passed on by your
apostles.
3 First oﬀ, you need to know that in the
last days, mockers are going to have a
heyday. Reducing everything to the level
of their puny feelings,
4 they'll mock, "So what's happened
to the promise of his Coming? Our
ancestors are dead and buried, and
everything's going on just as it has
from the ﬁrst day of crea on. Nothing's
changed."
5 They conveniently forget that long ago
all the galaxies and this very planet were
brought into existence out of watery
chaos by God's word.
6 Then God's word brought the chaos
back in a ﬂood that destroyed the world.2 PETER 3
11
7 The current galaxies and earth are fuel
for the ﬁnal ﬁre. God is poised, ready to
speak his word again, ready to give the
signal for the judgment and destruc on
of the desecra ng skep cs.
8 Don't overlook the obvious here,
friends. With God, one day is as good as
a thousand years, a thousand years as a
day.
9 God isn't late with his promise as
some measure lateness. He is restraining
himself on account of you, holding back
the End because he doesn't want anyone
lost. He's giving everyone space and
me to change.
10 But when the Day of God's Judgment
does come, it will be unannounced,
like a thief. The sky will collapse
with a thunderous bang, everything
disintegra ng in a huge conﬂagra on,
earth and all its works exposed to the
scru ny of Judgment.2 PETER 3
12
11 Since everything here today might
well be gone tomorrow, do you see how
essen al it is to live a holy life?
12 Daily expect the Day of God, eager
for its arrival. The galaxies will burn up
and the elements melt down that day--
13 but [we'll] hardly no ce. We'll
be looking the other way, ready for
the promised new heavens and the
promised new earth, all landscaped with
righteousness.
14 So, my dear friends, since this is what
you have to look forward to, do your
very best to be found living at your best,
in purity and peace.
15 Interpret our Master's pa ent
restraint for what it is: salva on. Our
good brother Paul, who was given much
wisdom in these ma ers,
16 refers to this in all his le ers, and has
wri en you essen ally the same thing.
Some things Paul writes are diﬃcult2 PETER 3
13
to understand. Irresponsible people
who don't know what they are talking
about twist them every which way. They
do it to the rest of the Scriptures, too,
destroying themselves as they do it.
17 But you, friends, are well-warned. Be
on guard lest you lose your foo ng and
get swept oﬀ your feet by these lawless
and loose-talking teachers.
18 Grow in grace and understanding
of our Master and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Glory to the Master, now and forever!
Yes!1 John
1
1 From the very ﬁrst day, we were
there, taking it all in--we heard it
with our own ears, saw it with our own
eyes, veriﬁed it with our own hands.
2 The Word of Life appeared right
before our eyes; we saw it happen! And
now we're telling you in most sober
prose that what we witnessed was,
incredibly, this: The inﬁnite Life of God
himself took shape before us.
3 We saw it, we heard it, and now we're
telling you so you can experience it along
with us, this experience of communion
with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ.
4 Our mo ve for wri ng is simply this:
We want you to enjoy this, too. Your joy
will double our joy!1 JOHN 1
2
5 This, in essence, is the message we
heard from Christ and are passing on to
you: God is light, pure light; there's not a
trace of darkness in him.
6 If we claim that we experience a
shared life with him and con nue to
stumble around in the dark, we're
obviously lying through our teeth--we're
not [living] what we claim.
7 But if we walk in the light, God himself
being the light, we also experience a
shared life with one another, as the
sacriﬁced blood of Jesus, God's Son,
purges all our sin.
8 If we claim that we're free of sin,
we're only fooling ourselves. A claim like
that is errant nonsense.
9 On the other hand, if we admit our
sins--make a clean breast of them--he
won't let us down; he'll be true to
himself. He'll forgive our sins and purge
us of all wrongdoing.1 JOHN 1 – 2
3
10 If we claim that we've never sinned,
we out-and-out contradict God--make
a liar out of him. A claim like that only
shows oﬀ our ignorance of God.
1 I write this, dear children, to guide
you out of sin. But if anyone does sin,
we have a Priest-Friend in the presence
of the Father: Jesus Christ, righteous
Jesus.
2 When he served as a sacriﬁce for
our sins, he solved the sin problem
for good--not only ours, but the whole
world's.
3 Here's how we can be sure that we
know God in the right way: Keep his
commandments.
4 If someone claims, "I know him well!"
but doesn't keep his commandments,
he's obviously a liar. His life doesn't
match his words.
5 But the one who keeps God's word
is the person in whom we see God's
21 JOHN 2
4
mature love. This is the only way to be
sure we're in God.
6 Anyone who claims to be in mate
with God ought to live the same kind of
life Jesus lived.
7 My dear friends, I'm not wri ng
anything new here. This is the oldest
commandment in the book, and you've
known it from day one. It's always been
implicit in the Message you've heard.
8 On the other hand, perhaps it is new,
freshly minted as it is in both Christ and
you--the darkness on its way out and the
True Light already blazing!
9 Anyone who claims to live in God's
light and hates a brother or sister is s ll
in the dark.
10 It's the person who loves brother
and sister who dwells in God's light and
doesn't block the light from others.
11 But whoever hates is s ll in the dark,
stumbles around in the dark, doesn't1 JOHN 2
5
know which end is up, blinded by the
darkness.
12 I remind you, my dear children: Your
sins are forgiven in Jesus' name.
13 You veterans were in on the ground
ﬂoor, and know the One who started
all this; you newcomers have won a big
victory over the Evil One. And a second
reminder, dear children: You know the
Father from personal experience.
14 You veterans know the One who
started it all; and you newcomers--such
vitality and strength! God's word is so
steady in you. Your fellowship with God
enables you to gain a victory over the
Evil One.
15 Don't love the world's ways. Don't
love the world's goods. Love of the world
squeezes out love for the Father.
16 Prac cally everything that goes on
in the world--wan ng your own way,
wan ng everything for yourself, wan ng1 JOHN 2
6
to appear important--has nothing to do
with the Father. It just isolates you from
him.
17 The world and all its wan ng,
wan ng, wan ng is on the way out--but
whoever does what God wants is set for
eternity.
18 Children, me is just about up. You
heard that An christ is coming. Well,
they're all over the place, an christs
everywhere you look. That's how we
know that we're close to the end.
19 They le us, but they were never
really with us. If they had been, they
would have stuck it out with us, loyal
to the end. In leaving, they showed
their true colors, showed they never did
belong.
20 But you belong. The Holy One
anointed you, and you all know it.
21 I haven't been wri ng this to tell
you something you don't know, but to1 JOHN 2
7
conﬁrm the truth you do know, and to
remind you that the truth doesn't breed
lies.
22 So who is lying here? It's the person
who denies that Jesus is the Divine
Christ, that's who. This is what makes an
an christ: denying the Father, denying
the Son.
23 No one who denies the Son has any
part with the Father, but aﬃrming the
Son is an embrace of the Father as well.
24 Stay with what you heard from the
beginning, the original message. Let it
sink into your life. If what you heard from
the beginning lives deeply in you, you
will live deeply in both Son and Father.
25 This is exactly what Christ promised:
eternal life, real life!
26 I've wri en to warn you about those
who are trying to deceive you.
27 But they're no match for what is
embedded deeply within you--Christ's1 JOHN 2 – 3
8
anoin ng, no less! You don't need any
of their so-called teaching. Christ's
anoin ng teaches you the truth on
everything you need to know about
yourself and him, uncontaminated by a
single lie. Live deeply in what you were
taught.
28 And now, children, stay with Christ.
Live deeply in Christ. Then we'll be
ready for him when he appears, ready
to receive him with open arms, with no
cause for red-faced guilt or lame excuses
when he arrives.
29 Once you're convinced that he is
right and righteous, you'll recognize that
all who prac ce righteousness are God's
true children.
1 What marvelous love the Father
has extended to us! Just look at
it--we're called children of God! That's
who we really are. But that's also why
the world doesn't recognize us or take
31 JOHN 3
9
us seriously, because it has no idea who
he is or what he's up to.
2 But friends, that's exactly who we
are: children of God. And that's only the
beginning. Who knows how we'll end
up! What we know is that when Christ is
openly revealed, we'll see him--and in
seeing him, become like him.
3 All of us who look forward to his
Coming stay ready, with the glistening
purity of Jesus' life as a model for our
own.
4 All who indulge in a sinful life are
dangerously lawless, for sin is a major
disrup on of God's order.
5 Surely you know that Christ showed
up in order to get rid of sin. There is
no sin in him, and sin is not part of his
program.
6 No one who lives deeply in Christ
makes a prac ce of sin. None of those
who do prac ce sin have taken a good1 JOHN 3
10
look at Christ. They've got him all
backwards.
7 So, my dear children, don't let anyone
divert you from the truth. It's the person
who [acts] right who [is] right, just as we
see it lived out in our righteous Messiah.
8 Those who make a prac ce of sin
are straight from the Devil, the pioneer
in the prac ce of sin. The Son of God
entered the scene to abolish the Devil's
ways.
9 People conceived and brought into life
by God don't make a prac ce of sin. How
could they? God's seed is deep within
them, making them who they are. It's
not in the nature of the God-bego en to
prac ce and parade sin.
10 Here's how you tell the diﬀerence
between God's children and the Devil's
children: The one who won't prac ce
righteous ways isn't from God, nor is the1 JOHN 3
11
one who won't love brother or sister. A
simple test.
11 For this is the original message we
heard: We should love each other.
12 We must not be like Cain, who joined
the Evil One and then killed his brother.
And why did he kill him? Because he was
deep in the prac ce of evil, while the
acts of his brother were righteous.
13 So don't be surprised, friends, when
the world hates you. This has been going
on a long me.
14 The way we know we've been
transferred from death to life is that we
love our brothers and sisters. Anyone
who doesn't love is as good as dead.
15 Anyone who hates a brother or sister
is a murderer, and you know very well
that eternal life and murder don't go
together.
16 This is how we've come to understand
and experience love: Christ sacriﬁced his1 JOHN 3
12
life for us. This is why we ought to live
sacriﬁcially for our fellow believers, and
not just be out for ourselves.
17 If you see some brother or sister
in need and have the means to do
something about it but turn a cold
shoulder and do nothing, what happens
to God's love? It disappears. And you
made it disappear.
18 My dear children, let's not just talk
about love; let's prac ce real love.
19 This is the only way we'll know we're
living truly, living in God's reality.
20 It's also the way to shut down
debilita ng self-cri cism, even when
there is something to it. For God is
greater than our worried hearts and
knows more about us than we do
ourselves.
21 And friends, once that's taken care
of and we're no longer accusing or1 JOHN 3 – 4
13
condemning ourselves, we're bold and
free before God!
22 We're able to stretch our hands out
and receive what we asked for because
we're doing what he said, doing what
pleases him.
23 Again, this is God's command: to
believe in his personally named Son,
Jesus Christ. He told us to love each
other, in line with the original command.
24 As we keep his commands, we live
deeply and surely in him, and he lives in
us. And this is how we experience his
deep and abiding presence in us: by the
Spirit he gave us.
1 My dear friends, don't believe
everything you hear. Carefully weigh
and examine what people tell you.
Not everyone who talks about God
comes from God. There are a lot of lying
preachers loose in the world.
41 JOHN 4
14
2 Here's how you test for the genuine
Spirit of God. Everyone who confesses
openly his faith in Jesus Christ--the
Son of God, who came as an actual
ﬂesh-and-blood person--comes from
God and belongs to God.
3 And everyone who refuses to confess
faith in Jesus has nothing in common
with God. This is the spirit of an christ
that you heard was coming. Well, here it
is, sooner than we thought!
4 My dear children, you come from
God and belong to God. You have
already won a big victory over those
false teachers, for the Spirit in you is far
stronger than anything in the world.
5 These people belong to the Christ-
denying world. They talk the world's
language and the world eats it up.
6 But we come from God and belong
to God. Anyone who knows God
understands us and listens. The person1 JOHN 4
15
who has nothing to do with God will, of
course, not listen to us. This is another
test for telling the Spirit of Truth from
the spirit of decep on.
7 My beloved friends, let us con nue to
love each other since love comes from
God. Everyone who loves is born of God
and experiences a rela onship with God.
8 The person who refuses to love
doesn't know the ﬁrst thing about God,
because God [is] love--so you can't know
him if you don't love.
9 This is how God showed his love for
us: God sent his only Son into the world
so we might live through him.
10 This is the kind of love we are talking
about--not that we once upon a me
loved God, but that he loved us and sent
his Son as a sacriﬁce to clear away our
sins and the damage they've done to our
rela onship with God.1 JOHN 4
16
11 My dear, dear friends, if God loved us
like this, we certainly ought to love each
other.
12 No one has seen God, ever. But
if we love one another, God dwells
deeply within us, and his love becomes
complete in us--perfect love!
13 This is how we know we're living
steadily and deeply in him, and he in us:
He's given us life from his life, from his
very own Spirit.
14 Also, we've seen for ourselves and
con nue to state openly that the Father
sent his Son as Savior of the world.
15 Everyone who confesses that Jesus is
God's Son par cipates con nuously in
an in mate rela onship with God.
16 We know it so well, we've embraced
it heart and soul, this love that comes
from God. God is love. When we take up
permanent residence in a life of love, we
live in God and God lives in us.1 JOHN 4
17
17 This way, love has the run of the
house, becomes at home and mature
in us, so that we're free of worry on
Judgment Day--our standing in the world
is iden cal with Christ's.
18 There is no room in love for fear.
Well-formed love banishes fear. Since
fear is crippling, a fearful life--fear of
death, fear of judgment--is one not yet
fully formed in love.
19 We, though, are going to love--love
and be loved. First we were loved, now
we love. He loved us ﬁrst.
20 If anyone boasts, "I love God," and
goes right on ha ng his brother or sister,
thinking nothing of it, he is a liar. If he
won't love the person he can see, how
can he love the God he can't see?
21 The command we have from Christ
is blunt: Loving God includes loving
people. You've got to love both.1 JOHN 5
5
18
1 Every person who believes that
Jesus is, in fact, the Messiah, is
God-bego en. If we love the One who
conceives the child, we'll surely love the
child who was conceived.
2 The reality test on whether or not we
love God's children is this: Do we love
God? Do we keep his commands?
3 The proof that we love God comes
when we keep his commandments and
they are not at all troublesome.
4 Every God-bego en person conquers
the world's ways. The conquering power
that brings the world to its knees is our
faith.
5 The person who wins out over the
world's ways is simply the one who
believes Jesus is the Son of God.
6 Jesus--the Divine Christ! He
experienced a life-giving birth and a
death-killing death. Not only birth from
the womb, but bap smal birth of his1 JOHN 5
19
ministry and sacriﬁcial death. And all the
while the Spirit is conﬁrming the truth,
the reality of God's presence at Jesus'
bap sm and cruciﬁxion, bringing those
occasions alive for us.
7 A triple tes mony:
8 the Spirit, the Bap sm, the Cruciﬁxion.
And the three in perfect agreement.
9 If we take human tes mony at face
value, how much more should we be
reassured when God gives tes mony as
he does here, tes fying concerning his
Son.
10 Whoever believes in the Son of God
inwardly conﬁrms God's tes mony.
Whoever refuses to believe in eﬀect calls
God a liar, refusing to believe God's own
tes mony regarding his Son.
11 This is the tes mony in essence: God
gave us eternal life; the life is in his Son.
12 So, whoever has the Son, has life;
whoever rejects the Son, rejects life.1 JOHN 5
13 My purpose in wri
20
ng is simply this:
that you who believe in God's Son will
know beyond the shadow of a doubt
that you have eternal life, the reality and
not the illusion.
14 And how bold and free we then
become in his presence, freely asking
according to his will, sure that he's
listening.
15 And if we're conﬁdent that he's
listening, we know that what we've
asked for is as good as ours.
16 For instance, if we see a Chris an
believer sinning (clearly I'm not talking
about those who make a prac ce of sin
in a way that is "fatal," leading to eternal
death), we ask for God's help and he
gladly gives it, gives life to the sinner
whose sin is not fatal. There is such a
thing as a fatal sin, and I'm not urging
you to pray about that.1 JOHN 5
21
17 Everything we do wrong is sin, but
not all sin is fatal.
18 We know that none of the God-
bego en makes a prac ce of sin--fatal
sin. The God-bego en are also the
God-protected. The Evil One can't lay a
hand on them.
19 We know that we are held ﬁrm by
God; it's only the people of the world
who con nue in the grip of the Evil One.
20 And we know that the Son of
God came so we could recognize and
understand the truth of God--what a
gi !--and we are living in the Truth itself,
in God's Son, Jesus Christ. This Jesus is
both True God and Real Life.
21 Dear children, be on guard against all
clever facsimiles.2 John
1 My dear congrega
on, I, your
pastor, love you in very truth. And
I'm not alone--everyone who knows the
Truth
2 that has taken up permanent
residence in us loves you.
3 Let grace, mercy, and peace be with
us in truth and love from God the Father
and from Jesus Christ, Son of the Father!
4 I can't tell you how happy I am to
learn that many members of your
congrega on are diligent in living out
the Truth, exactly as commanded by the
Father.
5 But permit me a reminder, friends,
and this is not a new commandment but
simply a repe on of our original and
basic charter: that we love each other.
12 JOHN 1
2
6 Love means following his
commandments, and his unifying
commandment is that you conduct your
lives in love. This is the ﬁrst thing you
heard, and nothing has changed.
7 There are a lot of smooth-talking
charlatans loose in the world who refuse
to believe that Jesus Christ was truly
human, a ﬂesh-and-blood human being.
Give them their true tle: Deceiver!
An christ!
8 And be very careful around them so
you don't lose out on what we've worked
so diligently in together; I want you to
get every reward you have coming to
you.
9 Anyone who gets so progressive in
his thinking that he walks out on the
teaching of Christ, walks out on God. But
whoever stays with the teaching, stays
faithful to both the Father and the Son.2 JOHN 1
3
10 If anyone shows up who doesn't hold
to this teaching, don't invite him in and
give him the run of the place.
11 That would just give him a pla orm
to perpetuate his evil ways, making you
his partner.
12 I have a lot more things to tell you,
but I'd rather not use paper and ink. I
hope to be there soon in person and
have a heart-to-heart talk. That will be
far more sa sfying to both you and me.
13 Everyone here in your sister
congrega on sends gree ngs.3 John
1
1 The Pastor, to my good friend
Gaius: How truly I love you!
2 We're the best of friends, and I pray
for good fortune in everything you do,
and for your good health--that your
everyday aﬀairs prosper, as well as your
soul!
3 I was most happy when some friends
arrived and brought the news that you
persist in following the way of Truth.
4 Nothing could make me happier than
ge ng reports that my children con nue
diligently in the way of Truth!
5 Dear friend, when you extend
hospitality to Chris an brothers and
sisters, even when they are strangers,
you make the faith visible.3 JOHN 1
2
6 They've made a full report back to the
church here, a message about your love.
It's good work you're doing, helping
these travelers on their way, hospitality
worthy of God himself!
7 They set out under the banner of the
Name, and get no help from unbelievers.
8 So they deserve any support we can
give them. In providing meals and a
bed, we become their companions in
spreading the Truth.
9 Earlier I wrote something along this
line to the church, but Diotrephes, who
loves being in charge, denigrates my
counsel.
10 If I come, you can be sure I'll hold
him to account for spreading vicious
rumors about us. As if that weren't bad
enough, he not only refuses hospitality
to traveling Chris ans but tries to stop
others from welcoming them. Worse3 JOHN 1
3
yet, instead of invi ng them in he throws
them out.
11 Friend, don't go along with evil.
Model the good. The person who does
good does God's work. The person who
does evil falsiﬁes God, doesn't know the
ﬁrst thing about God.
12 Everyone has a good word for
Demetrius--the Truth itself stands up for
Demetrius! We concur, and you know
we don't hand out endorsements lightly.
13 I have a lot more things to tell you,
but I'd rather not use pen and ink.
14 I hope to be there soon in person
and have a heart-to-heart talk. Peace to
you. The friends here say hello. Greet
our friends there by name.Jude

3 Dear friends, I've dropped everything
to write you about this life of salva on
that we have in common. I have to write
insis ng--begging!--that you ﬁght with
everything you have in you for this faith
entrusted to us as a gi to guard and
cherish.
4 What has happened is that some
people have inﬁltrated our ranks
(our Scriptures warned us this would
happen), who beneath their pious skinJUDE 1
2
are shameless scoundrels. Their design
is to replace the sheer grace of our God
with sheer license--which means doing
away with Jesus Christ, our one and only
Master.
5 I'm laying this out as clearly as I can,
even though you once knew all this well
enough and shouldn't need reminding.
Here it is in brief: The Master saved a
people out of the land of Egypt. Later he
destroyed those who defected.
6 And you know the story of the
angels who didn't s ck to their post,
abandoning it for other, darker missions.
But they are now chained and jailed in a
black hole un l the great Judgment Day.
7 Sodom and Gomorrah, which went
to sexual rack and ruin along with the
surrounding ci es that acted just like
them, are another example. Burning
and burning and never burning up, they
serve s ll as a stock warning.JUDE 1
3
8 This is exactly the same program of
these latest inﬁltrators: dirty sex, rule
and rulers thrown out, glory dragged in
the mud.
9 The Archangel Michael, who went to
the mat with the Devil as they fought
over the body of Moses, wouldn't have
dared level him with a blasphemous
curse, but said simply, "No you don't.
God will take care of you!"
10 But these people sneer at anything
they can't understand, and by doing
whatever they feel like doing--living by
animal ins nct only--they par cipate in
their own destruc on.
11 I'm fed up with them! They've gone
down Cain's road; they've been sucked
into Balaam's error by greed; they're
canceled out in Korah's rebellion.
12 These people are warts on your love
feasts as you worship and eat together.
They're giving you a black eye--carousingJUDE 1
4
shamelessly, grabbing anything that isn't
nailed down. They're--Puﬀs of smoke
pushed by gusts of wind; late autumn
trees stripped clean of leaf and fruit,
Doubly dead, pulled up by the roots;
13 wild ocean waves leaving nothing on
the beach but the foam of their shame;
Lost stars in outer space on their way to
the black hole.
14 Enoch, the seventh a er Adam,
prophesied of them: "Look! The Master
comes with thousands of holy angels
15 to bring judgment against them all,
convic ng each person of every deﬁling
act of shameless sacrilege, of every dirty
word they have spewed of their pious
ﬁlth."
16 These are the "grumpers," the
bellyachers, grabbing for the biggest
piece of the pie, talking big, saying
anything they think will get them ahead.JUDE 1
5
17 But remember, dear friends, that the
apostles of our Master, Jesus Christ, told
us this would happen:
18 "In the last days there will be people
who don't take these things seriously
anymore. They'll treat them like a joke,
and make a religion of their own whims
and lusts."
19 These are the ones who split
churches, thinking only of themselves.
There's nothing to them, no sign of the
Spirit!
20 But you, dear friends, carefully build
yourselves up in this most holy faith by
praying in the Holy Spirit,
21 staying right at the center of God's
love, keeping your arms open and
outstretched, ready for the mercy of our
Master, Jesus Christ. This is the unending
life, the [real] life!
22 Go easy on those who hesitate in the
faith.JUDE 1
23 Go a

er those who take the wrong
way. Be tender with sinners, but not
so on sin. The sin itself s nks to high
heaven.
24 And now to him who can keep you
on your feet, standing tall in his bright
presence, fresh and celebra ng--
25 to our one God, our only Savior,
through Jesus Christ, our Master, be
glory, majesty, strength, and rule before

10 It was Sunday and I was in the Spirit,
praying. I heard a loud voice behind me,
trumpet-clear and piercing:
11 "Write what you see into a book.
Send it to the seven churches: to
Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thya ra,
Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea."
12 I turned and saw the voice. I saw a
gold menorah with seven branches,
13 And in the center, the Son of Man, in
a robe and gold breastplate,
14 hair a blizzard of white, Eyes pouring
ﬁre-blaze,
15 both feet furnace-ﬁred bronze, His
voice a cataract,
16 right hand holding the Seven Stars,
His mouth a sharp-bi ng sword, his face
a perigee sun.
17 I saw this and fainted dead at his
feet. His right hand pulled me upright,
his voice reassured me: "Don't fear: I am
First, I am Last,REVELATION 1 – 2

18 I'm Alive. I died, but I came to life,
and my life is now forever. See these keys
in my hand? They open and lock Death's
doors, they open and lock Hell's gates.
19 Now write down everything you see:
things that are, things about to be.
20 The Seven Stars you saw in my right

menorah--do you want to know what's
behind them? The Seven Stars are
the Angels of the seven churches; the
menorah's seven branches are the seven
churches."

Angel of the church. The One with
Seven Stars in his right-ﬁst grip, striding
through the golden seven-lights' circle,
speaks:

22 "Are your ears awake? Listen. Listen

1 Then I looked, and, oh!--a door
open into Heaven. The trumpet-
voice, the ﬁrst voice in my vision, called
out, "Ascend and enter. I'll show you
what happens next."
2 I was caught up at once in deep
worship and, oh!--a Throne set in
Heaven with One Seated on the Throne,
3 suﬀused in gem hues of amber and
ﬂame with a nimbus of emerald.
4 Twenty-four thrones circled the
Throne, with Twenty-four Elders seated,
white-robed, gold-crowned.
4REVELATION 4
16
5 Lightning ﬂash and thunder crash
pulsed from the Throne. Seven ﬁre-
blazing torches fronted the Throne
(these are the Sevenfold Spirit of God).
6 Before the Throne it was like a clear
crystal sea. Prowling around the Throne
were Four Animals, all eyes. Eyes to look
ahead, eyes to look behind.
7 The ﬁrst Animal like a lion, the second
like an ox, the third with a human face,
the fourth like an eagle in ﬂight.
8 The Four Animals were winged, each
with six wings. They were all eyes,
seeing around and within. And they
chanted night and day, never taking a
break: Holy, holy, holy Is God our Master,
Sovereign-Strong, THE WAS, THE IS, THE
COMING.
9 Every me the Animals gave glory and
honor and thanks to the One Seated
on the Throne--the age-a er-age Living
One--REVELATION 4 – 5
17
10 the Twenty-four Elders would
fall prostrate before the One Seated
on the Throne. They worshiped the
age-a er-age Living One. They threw
their crowns at the foot of the Throne,
chan ng,
11 Worthy, O Master! Yes, our God! Take
the glory! the honor! the power! You
created it all; It was created because you
wanted it.
1 I saw a scroll in the right hand of
the One Seated on the Throne. It
was wri en on both sides, fastened with
seven seals.
2 I also saw a powerful Angel, calling out
in a voice like thunder, "Is there anyone
who can open the scroll, who can break
its seals?"
3 There was no one--no one in Heaven,
no one on earth, no one from the
underworld--able to break open the
scroll and read it.
5REVELATION 5
18
4 I wept and wept and wept that no one
was found able to open the scroll, able
to read it.
5 One of the Elders said, "Don't weep.
Look--the Lion from Tribe Judah, the
Root of David's Tree, has conquered. He
can open the scroll, can rip through the
seven seals."
6 So I looked, and there, surrounded
by Throne, Animals, and Elders, was a
Lamb, slaughtered but standing tall.
Seven horns he had, and seven eyes,
the Seven Spirits of God sent into all the
earth.
7 He came to the One Seated on the
Throne and took the scroll from his right
hand.
8 The moment he took the scroll, the
Four Animals and Twenty-four Elders fell
down and worshiped the Lamb. Each
had a harp and each had a bowl, a goldREVELATION 5
19
bowl ﬁlled with incense, the prayers of
God's holy people.
9 And they sang a new song: Worthy!
Take the scroll, open its seals. Slain!
Paying in blood, you bought men and
women, Bought them back from all over
the earth, Bought them back for God.
10 Then you made them a Kingdom,
Priests for our God, Priest-kings to rule
over the earth.
11 I looked again. I heard a company of
Angels around the Throne, the Animals,
and the Elders--ten thousand mes ten
thousand their number, thousand a er
thousand a er thousand
12 in full song: The slain Lamb is worthy!
Take the power, the wealth, the wisdom,
the strength! Take the honor, the glory,
the blessing!
13 Then I heard every creature in
Heaven and earth, in underworld and
sea, join in, all voices in all places,REVELATION 5 – 6
20
singing: To the One on the Throne! To
the Lamb! The blessing, the honor, the
glory, the strength, For age a er age
a er age.
14 The Four Animals called out, "Oh,
Yes!" The Elders fell to their knees and
worshiped.
1 I watched while the Lamb ripped
oﬀ the ﬁrst of the seven seals. I
heard one of the Animals roar, "Come
out!"
2 I looked--I saw a white horse. Its
rider carried a bow and was given a
victory garland. He rode oﬀ victorious,
conquering right and le .
3 When the Lamb ripped oﬀ the second
seal, I heard the second Animal cry,
"Come out!"
4 Another horse appeared, this one red.
Its rider was oﬀ to take peace from the
earth, se ng people at each other's
6REVELATION 6
21
throats, killing one another. He was
given a huge sword.
5 When he ripped oﬀ the third seal, I
heard the third Animal cry, "Come out!"
I looked. A black horse this me. Its rider
carried a set of scales in his hand.
6 I heard a message (it seemed to issue
from the Four Animals): "A quart of
wheat for a day's wages, or three quarts
of barley, but all the oil and wine you
want."
7 When he ripped oﬀ the fourth seal,
I heard the fourth Animal cry, "Come
out!"
8 I looked. A colorless horse, sickly pale.
Its rider was Death, and Hell was close
on its heels. They were given power to
destroy a fourth of the earth by war,
famine, disease, and wild beasts.
9 When he ripped oﬀ the ﬁ h seal, I
saw the souls of those killed because
they had held ﬁrm in their witness to theREVELATION 6
22
Word of God. They were gathered under
the Altar,
10 and cried out in loud prayers, "How
long, Strong God, Holy and True? How
long before you step in and avenge our
murders?"
11 Then each martyr was given a white
robe and told to sit back and wait un l
the full number of martyrs was ﬁlled
from among their servant companions
and friends in the faith.
12 I watched while he ripped oﬀ the
sixth seal: a bone-jarring earthquake,
sun turned black as ink, moon all bloody,
13 stars falling out of the sky like ﬁgs
shaken from a tree in a high wind,
14 sky snapped shut like a book, islands
and mountains sliding this way and that.
15 And then pandemonium, everyone
and his dog running for cover--kings,
princes, generals, rich and strong, along
with every commoner, slave or free.REVELATION 6 – 7
23
They hid in mountain caves and rocky
dens,
16 calling out to mountains and rocks,
"Refuge! Hide us from the One Seated
on the Throne and the wrath of the
Lamb!
17 The great Day of their wrath has
come--who can stand it?"
1 Immediately I saw Four Angels
standing at the four corners of earth,
standing steady with a ﬁrm grip on the
four winds so no wind would blow on
earth or sea, not even rustle a tree.
2 Then I saw another Angel rising from
where the sun rose, carrying the seal
of the Living God. He thundered to the
Four Angels assigned the task of hur ng
earth and sea,
3 "Don't hurt the earth! Don't hurt the
sea! Don't so much as hurt a tree un l
I've sealed the servants of our God on
their foreheads!"
7REVELATION 7
24
4 I heard the count of those who were
sealed: 144,000! They were sealed out
of every Tribe of Israel:
5 12,000 sealed from Judah, 12,000
from Reuben, 12,000 from Gad,
6 12,000 from Asher, 12,000 from
Naphtali, 12,000 from Manasseh,
7 12,000 from Simeon, 12,000 from
Levi, 12,000 from Issachar,
8 12,000 from Zebulun, 12,000 from
Joseph, 12,000 sealed from Benjamin.
9 I looked again. I saw a huge crowd,
too huge to count. Everyone was there-
-all na ons and tribes, all races and
languages. And they were [standing],
dressed in white robes and waving palm
branches, standing before the Throne
and the Lamb
10 and hear ly singing: Salva on to
our God on his Throne! Salva on to the
Lamb!REVELATION 7
25
11 All who were standing around the
Throne--Angels, Elders, Animals--fell
on their faces before the Throne and
worshiped God,
12 singing: Oh, Yes! The blessing and
glory and wisdom and thanksgiving, The
honor and power and strength, To our
God forever and ever and ever! Oh, Yes!
13 Just then one of the Elders addressed
me: "Who are these dressed in white
robes, and where did they come from?"
14 Taken aback, I said, "O Sir, I have
no idea--but you must know." Then he
told me, "These are those who come
from the great tribula on, and they've
washed their robes, scrubbed them
clean in the blood of the Lamb.
15 That's why they're standing before
God's Throne. They serve him day and
night in his Temple. The One on the
Throne will pitch his tent there for them:REVELATION 7 – 8
26
16 no more hunger, no more thirst, no
more scorching heat.
17 The Lamb on the Throne will
shepherd them, will lead them to spring
waters of Life. And God will wipe every
last tear from their eyes."
1 When the Lamb ripped oﬀ the
seventh seal, Heaven fell quiet-
-complete silence for about half an
hour.
2 I saw the Seven Angels who are always
in readiness before God handed seven
trumpets.
3 Then another Angel, carrying a gold
censer, came and stood at the Altar. He
was given a great quan ty of incense so
that he could oﬀer up the prayers of all
the holy people of God on the Golden
Altar before the Throne.
4 Smoke billowed up from the incense-
laced prayers of the holy ones, rose
before God from the hand of the Angel.
8REVELATION 8
27
5 Then the Angel ﬁlled the censer with
ﬁre from the Altar and heaved it to earth.
It set oﬀ thunders, voices, lightnings,
and an earthquake.
6 The Seven Angels with the trumpets
got ready to blow them.
7 At the ﬁrst trumpet blast, hail and
ﬁre mixed with blood were dumped on
earth. A third of the earth was scorched,
a third of the trees, and every blade of
green grass--burned to a crisp.
8 The second Angel trumpeted.
Something like a huge mountain blazing
with ﬁre was ﬂung into the sea. A third
of the sea turned to blood,
9 a third of the living sea creatures died,
and a third of the ships sank.
10 The third Angel trumpeted. A huge
Star, blazing like a torch, fell from
Heaven, wiping out a third of the rivers
and a third of the springs.REVELATION 8 – 9
28
11 The Star's name was Wormwood.
A third of the water turned bi er, and
many people died from the poisoned
water.
12 The fourth Angel trumpeted. A third
of the sun, a third of the moon, and a
third of the stars were hit, blacked out by
a third, both day and night in one-third
blackout.
13 I looked hard; I heard a lone eagle,
ﬂying through Middle-Heaven, crying
out ominously, "Doom! Doom! Doom
to everyone le on earth! There are
three more Angels about to blow their
trumpets. Doom is on its way!"
1 The ﬁ h Angel trumpeted. I saw a
Star plummet from Heaven to earth.
The Star was handed a key to the Well of
the Abyss.
2 He unlocked the Well of the Abyss--
smoke poured out of the Well, billows
and billows of smoke, sun and air in
9REVELATION 9
29
blackout from smoke pouring out of the
Well.
3 Then out of the smoke crawled locusts
with the venom of scorpions.
4 They were given their orders: "Don't
hurt the grass, don't hurt anything
green, don't hurt a single tree--only men
and women, and then only those who
lack the seal of God on their foreheads."
5 They were ordered to torture but not
kill, torture them for ﬁve months, the
pain like a scorpion s ng.
6 When this happens, people are going
to prefer death to torture, look for ways
to kill themselves. But they won't ﬁnd a
way--death will have gone into hiding.
7 The locusts looked like horses ready
for war. They had gold crowns, human
faces,
8 women's hair, the teeth of lions,
9 and iron breastplates. The sound
of their wings was the sound ofREVELATION 9
30
horse-drawn chariots charging into
ba le.
10 Their tails were equipped with s ngs,
like scorpion tails. With those tails they
were ordered to torture the human race
for ﬁve months.
11 They had a king over them, the
Angel of the Abyss. His name in
Hebrew is [Abaddon], in Greek,
[Apollyon]--"Destroyer."
12 The ﬁrst doom is past. Two dooms
yet to come.
13 The sixth Angel trumpeted. I heard a
voice speaking to the sixth Angel from
the horns of the Golden Altar before
God:
14 "Let the Four Angels loose, the Angels
conﬁned at the great River Euphrates."
15 The Four Angels were un ed and let
loose, Four Angels all prepared for the
exact year, month, day, and even hourREVELATION 9
31
when they were to kill a third of the
human race.
16 The number of the army of horsemen
was twice ten thousand mes ten
thousand. I heard the count
17 and saw both horses and riders in my
vision: ﬁery breastplates on the riders,
lion heads on the horses breathing out
ﬁre and smoke and brimstone.
18 With these three weapons--ﬁre and
smoke and brimstone--they killed a third
of the human race.
19 The horses killed with their mouths
and tails; their serpentlike tails also had
heads that wreaked havoc.
20 The remaining men and women who
weren't killed by these weapons went on
their merry way--didn't change their way
of life, didn't quit worshiping demons,
didn't quit centering their lives around
lumps of gold and silver and brass, hunksREVELATION 9 – 10
32
of stone and wood that couldn't see or
hear or move.
21 There wasn't a sign of a change of
heart. They plunged right on in their
murderous, occult, promiscuous, and
thieving ways.
1 I saw another powerful Angel
coming down out of Heaven
wrapped in a cloud. There was a rainbow
over his head, his face was sun-radiant,
his legs pillars of ﬁre.
2 He had a small book open in his hand.
He placed his right foot on the sea and
his le foot on land,
3 then called out thunderously, a lion
roar. When he called out, the Seven
Thunders called back.
4 When the Seven Thunders spoke, I
started to write it all down, but a voice
out of Heaven stopped me, saying, "Seal
with silence the Seven Thunders; don't
write a word."
10REVELATION 10
33
5 Then the Angel I saw astride sea and
land li ed his right hand to Heaven
6 and swore by the One Living Forever
and Ever, who created Heaven and
everything in it, earth and everything in
it, sea and everything in it, that me was
up--
7 that when the seventh Angel blew
his trumpet, which he was about to do,
the Mystery of God, all the plans he had
revealed to his servants, the prophets,
would be completed.
8 The voice out of Heaven spoke to me
again: "Go, take the book held open in
the hand of the Angel astride sea and
earth."
9 I went up to the Angel and said, "Give
me the li le book." He said, "Take it,
then eat it. It will taste sweet like honey,
but turn sour in your stomach."
10 I took the li le book from the Angel's
hand and it was sweet honey in myREVELATION 10 – 11
34
mouth, but when I swallowed, my
stomach curdled.
11 Then I was told, "You must go back
and prophesy again over many peoples
and na ons and languages and kings."
1 I was given a s ck for a
measuring rod and told, "Get up
and measure God's Temple and Altar
and everyone worshiping in it.
2 Exclude the outside court; don't
measure it. It's been handed over to
non-Jewish outsiders. They'll desecrate
the Holy City for forty-two months.
3 "Meanwhile, I'll provide my two
Witnesses. Dressed in sackcloth, they'll
prophesy for one thousand two hundred
sixty days.
4 These are the two Olive Trees, the
two Lampstands, standing at a en on
before God on earth.
11REVELATION 11
35
5 If anyone tries to hurt them, a blast
of ﬁre from their mouths will incinerate
them--burn them to a crisp just like that.
6 They'll have power to seal the sky so
that it doesn't rain for the me of their
prophesying, power to turn rivers and
springs to blood, power to hit earth with
any and every disaster as o en as they
want.
7 "When they've completed their
witness, the Beast from the Abyss will
emerge and ﬁght them, conquer and kill
them,
8 leaving their corpses exposed on the
street of the Great City spiritually called
Sodom and Egypt, the same City where
their Master was cruciﬁed.
9 For three and a half days they'll be
there--exposed, prevented from ge ng
a decent burial, stared at by the curious
from all over the world.REVELATION 11
36
10 Those people will cheer at the
spectacle, shou ng 'Good riddance!' and
calling for a celebra on, for these two
prophets pricked the conscience of all
the people on earth, made it impossible
for them to enjoy their sins.
11 "Then, a er three and a half days,
the Living Spirit of God will enter
them--they're on their feet!--and all
those gloa ng spectators will be scared
to death."
12 I heard a strong voice out of Heaven
calling, "Come up here!" and up they
went to Heaven, wrapped in a cloud,
their enemies watching it all.
13 At that moment there was a gigan c
earthquake--a tenth of the city fell to
ruin, seven thousand perished in the
earthquake, the rest frightened to the
core of their being, frightened into giving
honor to the God of Heaven.REVELATION 11
37
14 The second doom is past, the third
doom coming right on its heels.
15 The seventh Angel trumpeted. A
crescendo of voices in Heaven sang out,
The kingdom of the world is now the
Kingdom of our God and his Messiah! He
will rule forever and ever!
16 The Twenty-four Elders seated before
God on their thrones fell to their knees,
worshiped,
17 and sang, We thank you, O God,
Sovereign-Strong, WHO IS AND WHO
WAS. You took your great power and
took over--reigned!
18 The angry na ons now get a taste of
[your] anger. The me has come to judge
the dead, to reward your servants, all
prophets and saints, Reward small and
great who fear your Name, and destroy
the destroyers of earth.
19 The doors of God's Temple in Heaven
ﬂew open, and the Ark of his CovenantREVELATION 12
38
was clearly seen surrounded by ﬂashes
of lightning, loud shouts, peals of
thunder, an earthquake, and a ﬁerce
hailstorm.
1 A great Sign appeared in
Heaven: a Woman dressed all
in sunlight, standing on the moon, and
crowned with Twelve Stars.
2 She was giving birth to a Child and
cried out in the pain of childbirth.
3 And then another Sign alongside the
ﬁrst: a huge and ﬁery Dragon! It had
seven heads and ten horns, a crown on
each of the seven heads.
4 With one ﬂick of its tail it knocked
a third of the Stars from the sky
and dumped them on earth. The
Dragon crouched before the Woman in
childbirth, poised to eat up the Child
when it came.
5 The Woman gave birth to a Son who
will shepherd all na ons with an iron
12REVELATION 12
39
rod. Her Son was seized and placed
safely before God on his Throne.
6 The Woman herself escaped to the
desert to a place of safety prepared by
God, all comforts provided her for one
thousand two hundred and sixty days.
7 War broke out in Heaven. Michael
and his Angels fought the Dragon. The
Dragon and his Angels fought back,
8 but were no match for Michael. They
were cleared out of Heaven, not a sign
of them le .
9 The great Dragon--ancient Serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan, the one
who led the whole earth astray--thrown
out, and all his Angels thrown out with
him, thrown down to earth.
10 Then I heard a strong voice out of
Heaven saying, Salva on and power
are established! Kingdom of our God,
authority of his Messiah! The Accuser
of our brothers and sisters thrown out,REVELATION 12
40
who accused them day and night before
God.
11 They defeated him through the
blood of the Lamb and the bold word of
their witness. They weren't in love with
themselves; they were willing to die for
Christ.
12 So rejoice, O Heavens, and all who
live there, but doom to earth and sea,
For the Devil's come down on you with
both feet; he's had a great fall; He's wild
and raging with anger; he hasn't much
me and he knows it.
13 When the Dragon saw he'd been
thrown to earth, he went a er the
Woman who had given birth to the
Man-Child.
14 The Woman was given wings of a
great eagle to ﬂy to a place in the desert
to be kept in safety and comfort for a
me and mes and half a me, safe and
sound from the Serpent.REVELATION 12 – 13
41
15 The Serpent vomited a river of water
to swamp and drown her,
16 but earth came to her help,
swallowing the water the Dragon
spewed from its mouth.
17 Helpless with rage, the Dragon raged
at the Woman, then went oﬀ to make
war with the rest of her children, the
children who keep God's commands and
hold ﬁrm to the witness of Jesus.
1 And the Dragon stood on the
shore of the sea. I saw a Beast
rising from the sea. It had ten horns and
seven heads--on each horn a crown, and
each head inscribed with a blasphemous
name.
2 The Beast I saw looked like a leopard
with bear paws and a lion's mouth. The
Dragon turned over its power to it, its
throne and great authority.
3 One of the Beast's heads looked as
if it had been struck a deathblow, and
13REVELATION 13
42
then healed. The whole earth was agog,
gaping at the Beast.
4 They worshiped the Dragon who gave
the Beast authority, and they worshiped
the Beast, exclaiming, "There's never
been anything like the Beast! No one
would dare go to war with the Beast!"
5 The Beast had a loud mouth, boas ul
and blasphemous. It could do anything it
wanted for forty-two months.
6 It yelled blasphemies against God,
blasphemed his Name, blasphemed
his Church, especially those already
dwelling with God in Heaven.
7 It was permi ed to make war on
God's holy people and conquer them. It
held absolute sway over all tribes and
peoples, tongues and races.
8 Everyone on earth whose name was
not wri en from the world's founda on
in the slaughtered Lamb's Book of Life
will worship the Beast.REVELATION 13
43
9 Are you listening to this?
10 They've made their bed; now they
must lie in it. Anyone marked for
prison goes straight to prison; anyone
pulling a sword goes down by the
sword. Meanwhile, God's holy people
passionately and faithfully stand their
ground.
11 I saw another Beast rising out of the
ground. It had two horns like a lamb but
sounded like a dragon when it spoke.
12 It was a puppet of the ﬁrst Beast,
made earth and everyone in it worship
the ﬁrst Beast, which had been healed of
its deathblow.
13 This second Beast worked magical
signs, dazzling people by making ﬁre
come down from Heaven.
14 It used the magic it got from the
Beast to dupe earth dwellers, ge ng
them to make an image of the Beast that
received the deathblow and lived.REVELATION 13 – 14
44
15 It was able to animate the image
of the Beast so that it talked, and then
arrange that anyone not worshiping the
Beast would be killed.
16 It forced all people, small and great,
rich and poor, free and slave, to have a
mark on the right hand or forehead.
17 Without the mark of the name of the
Beast or the number of its name, it was
impossible to buy or sell anything.
18 Solve a riddle: Put your heads
together and ﬁgure out the meaning of
the number of the Beast. It's a human
number: six hundred sixty-six.
1 I saw--it took my breath away!-
-the Lamb standing on Mount
Zion, One Hundred and Forty-four
Thousand standing there with him,
his Name and the Name of his Father
inscribed on their foreheads.
2 And I heard a voice out of Heaven, the
sound like a cataract, like the crash of
14REVELATION 14
45
thunder. And then I heard music, harp
music
3 and the harpists singing a new song
before the Throne and the Four Animals
and the Elders. Only the Hundred and
Forty-four Thousand could learn to sing
the song. They were bought from earth,
4 lived without compromise, virgin-
fresh before God. Wherever the Lamb
went, they followed. They were bought
from humankind, ﬁrs ruits of the
harvest for God and the Lamb.
5 Not a false word in their mouths. A
perfect oﬀering.
6 I saw another Angel soaring in
Middle-Heaven. He had an Eternal
Message to preach to all who were s ll
on earth, every na on and tribe, every
tongue and people.
7 He preached in a loud voice, "Fear
God and give him glory! His hour of
judgment has come! Worship the MakerREVELATION 14
46
of Heaven and earth, salt sea and fresh
water!"
8 A second Angel followed, calling out,
"Ruined, ruined, Great Babylon ruined!
She made all the na ons drunk on the
wine of her whoring!"
9 A third Angel followed, shou ng,
warning, "If anyone worships the Beast
and its image and takes the mark on
forehead or hand,
10 that person will drink the wine of
God's wrath, prepared unmixed in his
chalice of anger, and suﬀer torment
from ﬁre and brimstone in the presence
of Holy Angels, in the presence of the
Lamb.
11 Smoke from their torment will rise
age a er age. No respite for those who
worship the Beast and its image, who
take the mark of its name."REVELATION 14
47
12 Meanwhile, the saints stand
passionately pa ent, keeping God's
commands, staying faithful to Jesus.
13 I heard a voice out of Heaven, "Write
this: Blessed are those who die in the
Master from now on; how blessed to die
that way!" "Yes," says the Spirit, "and
blessed rest from their hard, hard work.
None of what they've done is wasted;
God blesses them for it all in the end."
14 I looked up, I caught my breath!--a
white cloud and one like the Son of Man
si ng on it. He wore a gold crown and
held a sharp sickle.
15 Another Angel came out of the
Temple, shou ng to the Cloud-
Enthroned, "Swing your sickle and reap.
It's harvest me. Earth's harvest is ripe
for reaping."
16 The Cloud-Enthroned gave a mighty
sweep of his sickle, began harves ng
earth in a stroke.REVELATION 14 – 15
48
17 Then another Angel came out of the
Temple in Heaven. He also had a sharp
sickle.
18 Yet another Angel, the one in charge
of tending the ﬁre, came from the Altar.
He thundered to the Angel who held the
sharp sickle, "Swing your sharp sickle.
Harvest earth's vineyard. The grapes are
burs ng with ripeness."
19 The Angel swung his sickle, harvested
earth's vintage, and heaved it into the
winepress, the giant winepress of God's
wrath.
20 The winepress was outside the City.
As the vintage was trodden, blood
poured from the winepress as high as a
horse's bridle, a river of blood for two
hundred miles.
1 I saw another Sign in Heaven,
huge and breathtaking: seven
Angels with seven disasters. These are
15REVELATION 15
49
the ﬁnal disasters, the wrap-up of God's
wrath.
2 I saw something like a sea made of
glass, the glass all shot through with ﬁre.
Carrying harps of God, triumphant over
the Beast, its image, and the number of
its name, the saved ones stood on the
sea of glass.
3 They sang the Song of Moses, servant
of God; they sang the Song of the Lamb:
Mighty your acts and marvelous, O God,
the Sovereign-Strong! Righteous your
ways and true, King of the na ons!
4 Who can fail to fear you, God, give
glory to your Name? Because you and
you only are holy, all na ons will come
and worship you, because they see your
judgments are right.
5 Then I saw the doors of the Temple,
the Tent of Witness in Heaven, open
wide.REVELATION 15 – 16
50
6 The Seven Angels carrying the seven
disasters came out of the Temple. They
were dressed in clean, bright linen and
wore gold vests.
7 One of the Four Animals handed
the Seven Angels seven gold bowls,
brimming with the wrath of God, who
lives forever and ever.
8 Smoke from God's glory and power
poured out of the Temple. No one was
permi ed to enter the Temple un l the
seven disasters of the Seven Angels were
ﬁnished.
1 I heard a shout of command
from the Temple to the Seven
Angels: "Begin! Pour out the seven bowls
of God's wrath on earth!"
2 The ﬁrst Angel stepped up and poured
his bowl out on earth: Loathsome,
s nking sores erupted on all who
had taken the mark of the Beast and
worshiped its image.
16REVELATION 16
51
3 The second Angel poured his bowl on
the sea: The sea coagulated into blood,
and everything in it died.
4 The third Angel poured his bowl on
rivers and springs: The waters turned to
blood.
5 I heard the Angel of Waters say,
Righteous you are, and your judgments
are righteous, THE IS, THE WAS, THE
HOLY.
6 They poured out the blood of saints
and prophets so you've given them
blood to drink--they've go en what they
deserve!
7 Just then I heard the Altar chime in,
Yes, O God, the Sovereign-Strong! Your
judgments are true and just!
8 The fourth Angel poured his bowl on
the sun: Fire blazed from the sun and
scorched men and women.
9 Burned and blistered, they cursed
God's Name, the God behind theseREVELATION 16
52
disasters. They refused to repent,
refused to honor God.
10 The ﬁ h Angel poured his bowl on
the throne of the Beast: Its kingdom
fell into sudden eclipse. Mad with pain,
men and women bit and chewed their
tongues,
11 cursed the God of Heaven for their
torment and sores, and refused to
repent and change their ways.
12 The sixth Angel poured his bowl on
the great Euphrates River: It dried up to
nothing. The dry riverbed became a ﬁne
roadbed for the kings from the East.
13 From the mouths of the Dragon, the
Beast, and the False Prophet I saw three
foul demons crawl out--they looked like
frogs.
14 These are demon spirits performing
signs. They're a er the kings of the
whole world to get them gathered forREVELATION 16
53
ba le on the Great Day of God, the
Sovereign-Strong.
15 "Keep watch! I come unannounced,
like a thief. You're blessed if, awake and
dressed, you're ready for me. Too bad
if you're found running through the
streets, naked and ashamed."
16 The frog-demons gathered the kings
together at the place called in Hebrew
[Armageddon].
17 The seventh Angel poured his bowl
into the air: From the Throne in the
Temple came a shout, "Done!"
18 followed by lightning ﬂashes and
shouts, thunder crashes and a colossal
earthquake--a huge and devasta ng
earthquake, never an earthquake like it
since me began.
19 The Great City split three ways, the
ci es of the na ons toppled to ruin.
Great Babylon had to drink the wine ofREVELATION 16 – 17
54
God's raging anger--God remembered to
give her the cup!
20 Every island ﬂed and not a mountain
was to be found.
21 Hailstones weighing a ton
plummeted, crushing and smashing men
and women as they cursed God for the
hail, the epic disaster of hail.
1 One of the Seven Angels who
carried the seven bowls came
and invited me, "Come, I'll show you the
judgment of the great Whore who sits
enthroned over many waters,
2 the Whore with whom the kings of
the earth have gone whoring, show you
the judgment on earth dwellers drunk
on her whorish lust."
3 In the Spirit he carried me out in the
desert. I saw a woman mounted on a
Scarlet Beast. Stuﬀed with blasphemies,
the Beast had seven heads and ten
horns.
17REVELATION 17
55
4 The woman was dressed in purple
and scarlet, festooned with gold and
gems and pearls. She held a gold chalice
in her hand, brimming with deﬁling
obsceni es, her foul fornica ons.
5 A riddle-name was branded on her
forehead: GREAT BABYLON, MOTHER OF
WHORES AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE
EARTH.
6 I could see that the woman was drunk,
drunk on the blood of God's holy people,
drunk on the blood of the martyrs of
Jesus. Astonished, I rubbed my eyes. I
shook my head in wonder.
7 The Angel said, "Does this surprise
you? Let me tell you the riddle of the
woman and the Beast she rides, the
Beast with seven heads and ten horns.
8 The Beast you saw once was, is no
longer, and is about to ascend from the
Abyss and head straight for Hell. Earth
dwellers whose names weren't wri enREVELATION 17
56
in the Book of Life from the founda on
of the world will be dazzled when they
see the Beast that once was, is no longer,
and is to come.
9 "But don't drop your guard. Use your
head. The seven heads are seven hills;
they are where the woman sits.
10 They are also seven kings: ﬁve dead,
one living, the other not yet here--and
when he does come his me will be
brief.
11 The Beast that once was and is no
longer is both an eighth and one of the
seven--and headed for Hell.
12 "The ten horns you saw are ten kings,
but they're not yet in power. They will
come to power with the Scarlet Beast,
but won't last long--a very brief reign.
13 These kings will agree to turn over
their power and authority to the Beast.
14 They will go to war against the Lamb
but the Lamb will defeat them, proofREVELATION 17 – 18
57
that he is Lord over all lords, King over
all kings, and those with him will be the
called, chosen, and faithful."
15 The Angel con nued, "The waters
you saw on which the Whore was
enthroned are peoples and crowds,
na ons and languages.
16 And the ten horns you saw, together
with the Beast, will turn on the Whore-
-they'll hate her, violate her, strip her
naked, rip her apart with their teeth,
then set ﬁre to her.
17 It was God who put the idea in their
heads to turn over their rule to the Beast
un l the words of God are completed.
18 The woman you saw is the great city,
tyrannizing the kings of the earth."
1 Following this I saw another
Angel descend from Heaven.
His authority was immense, his glory
ﬂooded earth with brightness,
18REVELATION 18
58
2 his voice thunderous: Ruined, ruined,
Great Babylon, ruined! A ghost town for
demons is all that's le ! A garrison of
carrion spirits, garrison of loathsome,
carrion birds.
3 All na ons drank the wild wine of
her whoring; kings of the earth went
whoring with her; entrepreneurs made
millions exploi ng her.
4 Just then I heard another shout out
of Heaven: Get out, my people, as fast
as you can, so you don't get mixed up in
her sins, so you don't get caught in her
doom.
5 Her sins s nk to high Heaven; God has
remembered every evil she's done.
6 Give her back what she's given, double
what she's doubled in her works, double
the recipe in the cup she mixed;
7 Bring her ﬂaun ng and wild ways to
torment and tears. Because she gloated,REVELATION 18
59
"I'm queen over all, and no widow, never
a tear on my face,"
8 In one day, disasters will crush her-
-death, heartbreak, and famine--Then
she'll be burned by ﬁre, because God,
the Strong God who judges her, has had
enough.
9 "The kings of the earth will see the
smoke of her burning, and they'll cry and
carry on, the kings who went night a er
night to her brothel.
10 They'll keep their distance for fear
they'll get burned, and they'll cry their
lament: Doom, doom, the great city
doomed! City of Babylon, strong city! In
one hour it's over, your judgment come!
11 "The traders will cry and carry on
because the bo om dropped out of
business, no more market for their
goods:
12 gold, silver, precious gems, pearls;
fabrics of ﬁne linen, purple, silk, scarlet;REVELATION 18
60
perfumed wood and vessels of ivory,
precious woods, bronze, iron, and
marble;
13 cinnamon and spice, incense, myrrh,
and frankincense; wine and oil, ﬂour

chariots. And slaves--their terrible traﬃc
in human lives.
14 Everything you've lived for, gone! All
delicate and delectable luxury, lost! Not
a scrap, not a thread to be found!
15 "The traders who made millions oﬀ
her kept their distance for fear of ge ng
burned, and cried and carried on all the
more:
16 Doom, doom, the great city doomed!
Dressed in the latest fashions, adorned
with the ﬁnest jewels,
17 in one hour such wealth wiped out!
"All the ship captains and travelers by
sea, sailors and toilers of the sea, stood
oﬀ at a distanceREVELATION 18
61
18 and cried their lament when they
saw the smoke from her burning: 'Oh,
what a city! There was never a city like
her!'
19 They threw dust on their heads and
cried as if the world had come to an end:
Doom, doom, the great city doomed! All
who owned ships or did business by sea
Got rich on her ge ng and spending.
And now it's over--wiped out in one
hour!
20 "O Heaven, celebrate! And join in,
saints, apostles, and prophets! God has
judged her; every wrong you suﬀered
from her has been judged."
21 A strong Angel reached for a boulder-
-huge, like a millstone--and heaved it
into the sea, saying, Heaved and sunk,
the great city Babylon, sunk in the sea,
not a sign of her ever again.
22 Silent the music of harpists and
singers--you'll never hear ﬂutes andREVELATION 18 – 19
62
trumpets again. Ar sans of every
kind--gone; you'll never see their likes
again. The voice of a millstone grinding
falls dumb; you'll never hear that sound
again.
23 The light from lamps, never again;
never again laughter of bride and groom.
Her traders robbed the whole earth
blind, and by black-magic arts deceived
the na ons.
24 The only thing le of Babylon is
blood--the blood of saints and prophets,
the murdered and the martyred.
1 I heard a sound like massed
choirs in Heaven singing,
Hallelujah! The salva on and glory and
power are God's--
2 his judgments true, his judgments
just. He judged the great Whore who
corrupted the earth with her lust. He
avenged on her the blood of his servants.
19REVELATION 19
63
3 Then, more singing: Hallelujah! The
smoke from her burning billows up to
high Heaven forever and ever and ever.
4 The Twenty-four Elders and the
Four Animals fell to their knees and
worshiped God on his Throne, praising,
Amen! Yes! Hallelujah!
5 From the Throne came a shout, a
command: Praise our God, all you his
servants, All you who fear him, small and
great!
6 Then I heard the sound of massed
choirs, the sound of a mighty cataract,
the sound of strong thunder: Hallelujah!
The Master reigns, our God, the
Sovereign-Strong!
7 Let us celebrate, let us rejoice, let
us give him the glory! The Marriage of
the Lamb has come; his Wife has made
herself ready.REVELATION 19
64
8 She was given a bridal gown of bright
and shining linen. The linen is the
righteousness of the saints.
9 The Angel said to me, "Write this:
'Blessed are those invited to the
Wedding Supper of the Lamb.'" He
added, "These are the true words of
God!"
10 I fell at his feet to worship him, but
he wouldn't let me. "Don't do that," he
said. "I'm a servant just like you, and
like your brothers and sisters who hold
to the witness of Jesus. The witness of
Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
11 Then I saw Heaven open wide--and
oh! a white horse and its Rider. The
Rider, named Faithful and True, judges
and makes war in pure righteousness.
12 His eyes are a blaze of ﬁre, on his
head many crowns. He has a Name
inscribed that's known only to himself.REVELATION 19
65
13 He is dressed in a robe soaked with
blood, and he is addressed as "Word of
God."
14 The armies of Heaven, mounted on
white horses and dressed in dazzling
white linen, follow him.
15 A sharp sword comes out of his
mouth so he can subdue the na ons,
then rule them with a rod of iron. He
treads the winepress of the raging wrath
of God, the Sovereign-Strong.
16 On his robe and thigh is wri en, KING
OF KINGS, LORD OF LORDS.
17 I saw an Angel standing in the
sun, shou ng to all ﬂying birds in
Middle-Heaven, "Come to the Great
Supper of God!
18 Feast on the ﬂesh of kings and
captains and champions, horses and
their riders. Eat your ﬁll of them all--free

66
19 I saw the Beast and, assembled with
him, earth's kings and their armies,
ready to make war against the One on
the horse and his army.
20 The Beast was taken, and with him,
his puppet, the False Prophet, who used
signs to dazzle and deceive those who
had taken the mark of the Beast and
worshiped his image. They were thrown
alive, those two, into Lake Fire and
Brimstone.
21 The rest were killed by the sword of
the One on the horse, the sword that
comes from his mouth. All the birds held
a feast on their ﬂesh.
1 I saw an Angel descending out
of Heaven. He carried the key to
the Abyss and a chain--a huge chain.
2 He grabbed the Dragon, that old
Snake--the very Devil, Satan himself!-
-chained him up for a thousand
years,
20REVELATION 20
67
3 dumped him into the Abyss, slammed
it shut and sealed it ght. No more
trouble out of him, deceiving the
na ons--un l the thousand years are up.
A er that he has to be let loose brieﬂy.
4 I saw thrones. Those put in charge of
judgment sat on the thrones. I also saw
the souls of those beheaded because of
their witness to Jesus and the Word of
God, who refused to worship either the
Beast or his image, refused to take his
mark on forehead or hand--they lived
and reigned with Christ for a thousand
years!
5 The rest of the dead did not live un l
the thousand years were up. This is the
ﬁrst resurrec on--
6 and those involved most blessed,
most holy. No second death for them!
They're priests of God and Christ; they'll
reign with him a thousand years.REVELATION 20
68
7 When the thousand years are up,
Satan will be let loose from his cell,
8 and will launch again his old work of
deceiving the na ons, searching out
vic ms in every nook and cranny of
earth, even Gog and Magog! He'll talk
them into going to war and will gather a
huge army, millions strong.
9 They'll stream across the earth,
surround and lay siege to the camp of
God's holy people, the Beloved City.
They'll no sooner get there than ﬁre will
pour out of Heaven and burn them up.
10 The Devil who deceived them will
be hurled into Lake Fire and Brimstone,
joining the Beast and False Prophet, the
three in torment around the clock for
ages without end.
11 I saw a Great White Throne and the
One Enthroned. Nothing could stand
before or against the Presence, nothing
in Heaven, nothing on earth.REVELATION 20 – 21
69
12 And then I saw all the dead, great
and small, standing there--before the
Throne! And books were opened. Then
another book was opened: the Book of
Life. The dead were judged by what was
wri en in the books, by the way they
had lived.
13 Sea released its dead, Death and
Hell turned in their dead. Each man and
woman was judged by the way he or she
had lived.
14 Then Death and Hell were hurled into
Lake Fire. This is the second death--Lake
Fire.
15 Anyone whose name was not found
inscribed in the Book of Life was hurled
into Lake Fire.
1 I saw Heaven and earth new-
created. Gone the ﬁrst Heaven,
gone the ﬁrst earth, gone the sea.
2 I saw Holy Jerusalem, new-created,
descending resplendent out of Heaven,
21REVELATION 21
70
as ready for God as a bride for her
husband.
3 I heard a voice thunder from the
Throne: "Look! Look! God has moved
into the neighborhood, making his
home with men and women! They're his
people, he's their God.
4 He'll wipe every tear from their eyes.
Death is gone for good--tears gone,
crying gone, pain gone--all the ﬁrst order
of things gone."
5 The Enthroned con nued, "Look!
I'm making everything new. Write it
all down--each word dependable and
accurate."
6 Then he said, "It's happened. I'm A to
Z. I'm the Beginning, I'm the Conclusion.
From Water-of-Life Well I give freely to
the thirsty.
7 Conquerors inherit all this. I'll be God

8 But for the rest--the feckless and
faithless, degenerates and murderers,
sex peddlers and sorcerers, idolaters
and all liars--for them it's Lake Fire and
Brimstone. Second death!"
9 One of the Seven Angels who had
carried the bowls ﬁlled with the seven
ﬁnal disasters spoke to me: "Come here.
I'll show you the Bride, the Wife of the
Lamb."
10 He took me away in the Spirit to an
enormous, high mountain and showed
me Holy Jerusalem descending out of
Heaven from God,
11 resplendent in the bright glory of
God. The City shimmered like a precious
gem, light-ﬁlled, pulsing light.
12 She had a wall majes c and high
with twelve gates. At each gate stood an
Angel, and on the gates were inscribed
the names of the Twelve Tribes of the
sons of Israel:REVELATION 21
72
13 three gates on the east, three gates
on the north, three gates on the south,
three gates on the west.
14 The wall was set on twelve
founda ons, the names of the Twelve
Apostles of the Lamb inscribed on them.
15 The Angel speaking with me had a
gold measuring s ck to measure the
City, its gates, and its wall.
16 The City was laid out in a perfect
square. He measured the City with the
measuring s ck: twelve thousand stadia,
its length, width, and height all equal.
17 Using the standard measure, the
Angel measured the thickness of its wall:
144 cubits.
18 The wall was jasper, the color of
Glory, and the City was pure gold,
translucent as glass.
19 The founda ons of the City walls
were garnished with every precious gem
imaginable: the ﬁrst founda on jasper,REVELATION 21
73
the second sapphire, the third agate, the
fourth emerald,
20 the ﬁ h onyx, the sixth carnelian, the
seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the
ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the
eleventh jacinth, the twel h amethyst.
21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls,
each gate a single pearl. The main street
of the City was pure gold, translucent as
glass.
22 But there was no sign of a Temple, for
the Lord God--the Sovereign-Strong--and
the Lamb are the Temple.
23 The City doesn't need sun or moon
for light. God's Glory is its light, the Lamb
its lamp!
24 The na ons will walk in its light and
earth's kings bring in their splendor.
25 Its gates will never be shut by day,
and there won't be any night.
26 They'll bring the glory and honor of
the na ons into the City.REVELATION 21 – 22
74
27 Nothing dirty or deﬁled will get into
the City, and no one who deﬁles or
deceives. Only those whose names are
wri en in the Lamb's Book of Life will
get in.
1 Then the Angel showed me
Water-of-Life River, crystal bright.
It ﬂowed from the Throne of God and
the Lamb,
2 right down the middle of the street.
The Tree of Life was planted on each side
of the River, producing twelve kinds of
fruit, a ripe fruit each month. The leaves
of the Tree are for healing the na ons.
3 Never again will anything be cursed.
The Throne of God and of the Lamb is
at the center. His servants will oﬀer God
service--worshiping,
4 they'll look on his face, their foreheads
mirroring God.
5 Never again will there be any night.
No one will need lamplight or sunlight.
22REVELATION 22
75
The shining of God, the Master, is all the
light anyone needs. And they will rule
with him age a er age a er age.
6 The Angel said to me, "These are
dependable and accurate words, every
one. The God and Master of the spirits
of the prophets sent his Angel to show
his servants what must take place, and
soon.
7 And tell them, 'Yes, I'm on my way!'
Blessed be the one who keeps the words
of the prophecy of this book."
8 I, John, saw all these things with my
own eyes, heard them with my ears.
Immediately when I heard and saw, I fell
on my face to worship at the feet of the
Angel who laid it all out before me.
9 He objected, "No you don't! I'm
a servant just like you and your
companions, the prophets, and all who
keep the words of this book. Worship
God!"REVELATION 22
10 The Angel con
76
nued, "Don't seal

don't put it away on the shelf. Time is
just about up.
11 Let evildoers do their worst and the
dirty-minded go all out in pollu on, but
let the righteous maintain a straight
course and the holy con nue on in

12 "Yes, I'm on my way! I'll be there
soon! I'm bringing my payroll with me.
I'll pay all people in full for their life's
work.
13 I'm A to Z, the First and the Final,
Beginning and Conclusion.
14 "How blessed are those who wash
their robes! The Tree of Life is theirs for
good, and they'll walk through the gates
to the City.
15 But outside for good are the ﬁlthy
curs: sorcerers, fornicators, murderers,
idolaters--all who love and live lies.REVELATION 22
16 "I, Jesus, sent my Angel to tes

17 "Come!" say the Spirit and the Bride.
Whoever hears, echo, "Come!" Is anyone
thirsty? Come! All who will, come and
drink, Drink freely of the Water of Life!
18 I give fair warning to all who hear the
words of the prophecy of this book: If

God will add to your life the disasters
