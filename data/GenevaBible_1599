THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO ST.
MATTHEW
1 The booke of the generation of Jesus
Christ the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of
Abraham. 2 Abraham begate Isaac. And
Isaac begate Iacob.
And Iacob begat
Iudas and his brethren. 3 And Iudas
begate Phares, and Zara of Thamar. And
Phares begate Esrom. And Esrom begate
Aram. 4 And Aram begate Aminadab. And
Aminadab begate Naasson. And Naasson
begat Salmon. 5 And Salmon begate Booz
of Rachab. And Booz begat Obed of
Ruth. and Obed begat Iesse. 6 And Iesse
begate Dauid the King. And Dauid the
King begate Salomon of her that was the
wife of Vrias. 7 And Salomon begate
Roboam. And Roboam begate Abia. And
Abia begate Asa. 8 And Asa begate Ios-
aphat. And Iosaphat begate Ioram. And
Ioram begate Hozias. 9 And Hozias begat
Ioatham. And Ioatham begate Achaz.
And Achaz begate Ezekias. 10 And Ezekias
begate Manasses. And Manasses begate
Amon. And Amon begate Iosias. 11 And
Iosias begate Iakim. And Iakim begate
Iechonias and his brethren about the
time they were caried away to Babylon.
12 And after they were caried away into
Babylon, Iechonias begate Salathiel. And
Salathiel begate Zorobabel. 13 And Zorob-
abel begate Abiud. And Abiud begate
Eliacim. And Eliacim begate Azor. 14 And
Azor begate Sadoc. And Sadoc begate
Achim. And Achim begate Eliud. 15 And
Eliud begate Eleazar. And Eleazar begate
Matthan.
And Matthan begate Iacob.
16 And Iacob begat Ioseph ye husband of
Mary, of whom was borne Jesus, that is
called Christ. 17 So all the generations
from Abraham to Dauid, are fourtene
generations. And from Dauid vntil they
were caried away into Babylon, fourtene
generations: and after they were caried
away into Babylon vntill Christ, fourteene
generations. 18 Nowe the birth of Jesus
Christ was thus, When as his mother
Matthew 2:8
Mary was betrothed to Ioseph, before
they came together, shee was found with
childe of the holy Ghost. 19 Then Ioseph
her husband being a iust man, and not
willing to make her a publike example,
was minded to put her away secretly.
20 But whiles he thought these things,
behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared
vnto him in a dreame, saying, Ioseph, the
sonne of Dauid, feare not to take Mary
thy wife: for that which is conceiued in
her, is of the holy Ghost. 21 And she
shall bring foorth a sonne, and thou shalt
call his name JESUS: for hee shall saue
his people from their sinnes. 22 And al
this was done that it might be fulfilled,
which is spoken of the Lord by ye Prophet,
saying, 23 Behold, a virgine shalbe with
childe, and shall beare a sonne, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel, which is
by interpretation, God with vs. 24 Then
Ioseph, being raised from sleepe, did as
the Angel of the Lord had inioyned him,
and tooke his wife. 25 But he knew her
not, til she had broght forth her first
borne sonne, and he called his name
JESUS.
2
1 When Jesus then was borne at Beth-
leem in Iudea, in the dayes of Herod the
King, beholde, there came Wisemen from
the East to Hierusalem, 2 Saying, Where is
that King of the Iewes that is borne? for
wee haue seene his starre in the East, and
are come to worship him. 3 When King
Herod heard this, he was troubled, and
all Hierusalem with him. 4 And gathering
together all the chiefe Priestes and Scribes
of the people, hee asked of them, where
Christ should be borne. 5 And they saide
vnto him, At Beth-leem in Iudea: for so it
is written by the Prophet, 6 And thou Beth-
leem in the lande of Iuda, art not the least
among the Princes of Iuda: For out of
thee shall come the gouernour that shall
feede that my people Israel. 7 Then Herod
priuily called the Wisemen, and diligently
inquired of them the time of the starre
that appeared, 8 And sent them to Beth-
leem, saying, Goe, and searche diligentlyMatthew 2:9
833
for the babe: and when ye haue founde
him, bring mee worde againe, that I may
come also, and worship him. 9 So when
they had heard the King, they departed:
and loe, the starre which they had seene
in the East, went before them, till it came
and stoode ouer the place where the babe
was. 10 And when they sawe the starre,
they reioyced with an exceeding great ioy,
11 And went into the house, and founde
the babe with Mary his mother, and fell
downe, and worshipped him, and opened
their treasures, and presented vnto him
giftes, euen golde, and frankincense, and
myrrhe. 12 And after they were warned
of God in a dreame, that they should not
go againe to Herod, they returned into
their countrey another way. 13 After their
departure, behold, the Angel of the Lord
appeareth to Ioseph in a dreame, saying,
Arise, and take the babe and his mother,
and flee into Egypt, and be there til I
bring thee word: for Herod will seeke
the babe, to destroy him. 14 So he arose
and tooke the babe and his mother by
night, and departed into Egypt, 15 And
was there vnto the death of Herod, that
that might be fulfilled, which is spoken
of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Out
of Egypt haue I called my sonne. 16 Then
Herod, seeing that he was mocked of the
Wisemen, was exceeding wroth, and sent
foorth, and slew all the male children
that were in Beth-leem, and in all the
coasts thereof, from two yeere old and
vnder, according to the time which he had
diligently searched out of the Wisemen.
17 Then was that fulfilled which is spoken
by the Prophet Ieremias, saying, 18 In
Rhama was a voyce heard, mourning,
and weeping, and great howling: Rachel
weeping for her children, and would not
be comforted, because they were not.
19 And whe Herod was dead, behold, an
Angel of the Lord appeareth in a dreame
to Ioseph in Egypt, 20 Saying, Arise, and
take the babe and his mother, and goe
into the land of Israel: for they are dead
which sought the babes life. 21 Then
he arose vp and tooke the babe and his
mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew 3:13
22 But whe he heard that Archelaus did
reigne in Iudea in stead of his father
Herod, he was afraide to go thither: yet
after he was warned of God in a dreame,
he turned aside into the parts of Galile,
23 And went and dwelt in a citie called
Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the Prophets, which was,
That hee should be called a Nazarite.
1 And
3
in those dayes, Iohn the Bap-
tist came and preached in the wildernes
of Iudea, 2 And said, Repent: for the
kingdome of heauen is at hand. 3 For
this is he of whome it is spoken by the
Prophet Esaias, saying, The voyce of him
that crieth in the wildernes, Prepare ye
the way of the Lord: make his pathes
straight. 4 And this Iohn had his garment
of camels heare, and a girdle of a skinne
about his loynes: his meate was also
locusts and wilde hony. 5 Then went out
to him Ierusalem and all Iudea, and all
the region rounde about Iordan. 6 And
they were baptized of him in Iordan,
confessing their sinnes. 7 Now when he
sawe many of the Pharises, and of the
Sadduces come to his baptisme, he said
vnto them, O generations of vipers, who
hath forewarned you to flee from the
anger to come? 8 Bring foorth therefore
fruite worthy amendment of life. 9 And
thinke not to say with your selues, We
haue Abraham to our father: for I say
vnto you, that God is able euen of these
stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.
10 And now also is the axe put to the roote
of the trees: therfore euery tree which
bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen
downe, and cast into ye fire. 11 In deede
I baptize you with water to amendment
of life, but he that commeth after me,
is mightier then I, whose shoes I am
not worthie to beare: hee will baptize
you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.
12 Which hath his fanne in his hand,
and wil make cleane his floore, and
gather his wheate into his garner, but will
burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable
fire. 13 Then came Iesus from GalileMatthew 3:14
834
to Iordan vnto Iohn, to be baptized of
him. 14 But Iohn earnestly put him backe,
saying, I haue neede to be baptized of
thee, and commest thou to me? 15 Then
Iesus answering, saide to him, Let be
nowe: for thus it becommeth vs to fulfill
all righteousnes. So he suffered him.
16 And Iesus when hee was baptized, came
straight out of the water. And lo, the
heaues were opened vnto him, and Iohn
saw the Spirit of God descending like a
doue, and lighting vpon him. 17 And loe,
a voyce came from heauen, saying, This
is my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well
pleased.
4
1 Then was Iesus led aside of the Spirit
into the wildernes, to be tempted of
the deuil. 2 And when he had fasted
fourtie dayes, and fourtie nights, he was
3 Then came to
afterward hungrie.
him the tempter, and said, If thou be
the Sonne of God, commande that these
stones be made bread. 4 But he answering
said, It is written, Man shall not liue by
bread onely, but by euery worde that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
5 Then the deuil tooke him vp into the
holy Citie, and set him on a pinacle of the
temple, 6 And said vnto him, If thou be the
Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: for
it is written, that he wil giue his Angels
charge ouer thee, and with their hands
they shall lift thee vp, lest at any time
thou shouldest dash thy foote against a
stone. 7 Iesus saide vnto him, It is written
againe, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God. 8 Againe the deuil tooke him vp into
an exceeding hie mountaine, and shewed
him all the kingdomes of the world, and
the glory of them, 9 And sayd to him,
All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt
fall downe, and worship me. 10 Then
sayd Iesus vnto him, Auoyde Satan: for
it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.
11 Then the deuill left him: and beholde,
the Angels came, and ministred vnto him.
12 And when Iesus had heard that Iohn
was committed to prison, he returned
Matthew 5:3
into Galile. 13 And leauing Nazareth, went
and dwelt in Capernaum, which is neere
the sea in the borders of Zabulon and
Nephthalim, 14 That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Esaias the Propet,
saying, 15 The land of Zabulon, and the
land of Nephthalim by the way of the
sea, beyond Iordan, Galile of the Gentiles:
16 The people which sate in darkenes,
sawe great light: and to them which
sate in the region, and shadowe of death,
light is risen vp. 17 From that time Iesus
began to preach, and to say, Amende your
liues: for the kingdome of heauen is at
hand. 18 And Iesus walking by the sea of
Galile, sawe two brethren, Simon, which
was called Peter, and Andrew his brother,
casting a net into the sea (for they were
fishers.) 19 And he sayd vnto them, Follow
me, and I will make you fishers of men.
20 And they straightway leauing the nets,
folowed him. 21 And when he was gone
forth from thence, he saw other two
brethren, Iames the sonne of Zebedeus,
and Iohn his brother in a ship with Zebe-
deus their father, mending their nets, and
he called them. 22 And they without
tarying, leauing the ship, and their father,
folowed him. 23 So Iesus went about all
Galile, teaching in their Synagogues, and
preaching the Gospel of the kingdome,
and healing euery sicknesse and euery
disease among the people. 24 And his
fame spread abroad through all Syria:
and they brought vnto him all sicke peo-
ple, that were taken with diuers diseases
and torments, and them that were pos-
sessed with deuils, and those which were
lunatike, and those that had the palsey:
and he healed them. 25 And there folowed
him great multitudes out of Galile, and
Decapolis, and Hierusalem, and Iudea,
and from beyond Iordan.
5
1 And when he sawe the multitude, he
went vp into a mountaine: and when he
was set, his disciples came to him. 2 And
he opened his mouth and taught them,
saying, 3 Blessed are the poore in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.Matthew 5:4
835
4 Blessed are they that mourne: for they
shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the
meeke: for they shall inherite the earth.
6 Blessed are they which hunger and thirst
for righteousnes: for they shalbe filled.
7 Blessed are the mercifull: for they shall
obteine mercie. 8 Blessed are the pure in
heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed
are the peace makers: for they shall be
called the children of God. 10 Blessed are
they which suffer persecution for righ-
teousnes sake: for theirs is the kingdome
of heauen. 11 Blessed shall ye be when
men reuile you, and persecute you, and
say all maner of euill against you for
my sake, falsely. 12 Reioyce and be glad,
for great is your reward in heauen: for
so persecuted they the Prophets which
were before you. 13 Ye are the salt of
the earth: but if the salt haue lost his
sauour, wherewith shall it be salted? It
is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be
cast out, and to be troden vnder foote of
men. 14 Ye are the light of the world. A
citie that is set on an hill, cannot be hid.
15 Neither doe men light a candel, and put
it vnder a bushel, but on a candlesticke,
and it giueth light vnto all that are in
the house. 16 Let your light so shine
before men, that they may see your good
workes, and glorifie your Father which is
in heauen. 17 Think not that I am come
to destroy the Lawe, or the Prophets. I
am not come to destroy them, but to
fulfill them. 18 For truely I say vnto you,
Till heauen, and earth perish, one iote
or one title of the Law shall not scape,
till all things be fulfilled. 19 Whosoeuer
therefore shall breake one of these least
commandements, and teach men so, he
shall be called the least in the kingdome of
heauen: but whosoeuer shall obserue and
teach them, the same shall be called great
in the kingdome of heauen. 20 For I say
vnto you, except your righteousnes ex-
ceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and
Pharises, ye shall not enter into the king-
dome of heauen. 21 Ye haue heard that
it was sayd vnto them of the olde time,
Thou shalt not kill: for whosoeuer killeth
shalbe culpable of iudgement. 22 But I
say vnto you, whosoeuer is angry with
Matthew 5:36
his brother vnaduisedly, shalbe culpable
of iudgment. And whosoeuer sayth vnto
his brother, Raca, shalbe worthy to be
punished by the Councill. And whosoeuer
shall say, Foole, shalbe worthy to be pun-
ished with hell fire. 23 If then thou bring
thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest
that thy brother hath ought against thee,
24 Leaue there thine offring before the
altar, and goe thy way: first be reconciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer
thy gift. 25 Agree with thine aduersarie
quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
him, lest thine aduersarie deliuer thee to
the Iudge, and the Iudge deliuer thee to
ye sergeant, and thou be cast into prison.
26 Verely I say vnto thee, thou shalt not
come out thence, till thou hast payed the
vtmost farthing. 27 Ye haue heard that
it was sayd to them of olde time, Thou
shalt not commit adulterie. 28 But I say
vnto you, that whosoeuer looketh on a
woman to lust after her, hath committed
adulterie with her already in his heart.
29 Wherefore if thy right eye cause thee
to offend, plucke it out, and cast it from
thee: for better it is for thee, that one of
thy members perish, then that thy whole
body should be cast into hell. 30 Also if thy
right hand make thee to offend, cut it off,
and cast it from thee: for better it is for
thee that one of thy members perish, then
that thy whole body should be cast into
hell. 31 It hath bene sayd also, Whosoeuer
shall put away his wife, let him giue her
a bill of diuorcement. 32 But I say vnto
you, whosoeuer shall put away his wife
(except it be for fornication) causeth her
to commit adulterie: and whosoeuer shall
marrie her that is diuorced, committeth
adulterie. 33 Againe, ye haue heard that
it was sayd to them of old time, Thou
shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt
performe thine othes to the Lord. 34 But I
say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by
heauen, for it is the throne of God: 35 Nor
yet by the earth: for it is his footestoole:
neither by Hierusalem: for it is the citie
of the great King. 36 Neither shalt thou
sweare by thine head, because thou canst
not make one heare white or blacke.Matthew 5:37
836
37 But
let your communication be Yea,
yea: Nay, nay. For whatsoeuer is more
then these, commeth of euill. 38 Ye haue
heard that it hath bene sayd, An eye for
an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. 39 But I say
vnto you, Resist not euill: but whosoeuer
shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne
to him the other also. 40 And if any man
wil sue thee at the law, and take away
thy coate, let him haue thy cloke also.
41 And whosoeuer will compell thee to goe
a mile, goe with him twaine. 42 Giue to
him that asketh, and from him that would
borowe of thee, turne not away. 43 Ye
haue heard that it hath bin said, Thou
shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate your
enemie. 44 But I say vnto you, Loue your
enemies: blesse them that curse you: doe
good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which hurt you, and persecute you,
45 That ye may be the children of your
father that is in heauen: for he maketh
his sunne to arise on the euill, and the
good, and sendeth raine on the iust, and
vniust. 46 For if ye loue them, which
loue you, what rewarde shall you haue?
Doe not the Publicanes euen the same?
47 And if ye be friendly to your brethren
onely, what singular thing doe ye? doe
not euen the Publicanes likewise? 48 Ye
shall therefore be perfit, as your Father
which is in heauen, is perfite.
6
1 Take heede that ye giue not your almes
before men, to be seene of them, or els
ye shall haue no reward of your Father
which is in heaue. 2 Therefore when thou
giuest thine almes, thou shalt not make a
trumpet to be blowen before thee, as the
hypocrites doe in the Synagogues and in
the streetes, to be praysed of men. Verely
I say vnto you, they haue their rewarde.
3 But when thou doest thine almes, let not
thy left hand knowe what thy right hand
doeth, 4 That thine almes may be in secret,
and thy Father that seeth in secret, hee
will rewarde thee openly. 5 And when
thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites:
for they loue to stand, and pray in the
Synagogues, and in the corners of the
Matthew 6:23
streetes, because they would be seene
of men. Verely I say vnto you, they
haue their rewarde. 6 But when thou
prayest, enter into thy chamber and when
thou hast shut thy doore, pray vnto thy
Father which is in secret, and thy Father
which seeth in secret, shall rewarde thee
openly. 7 Also when ye pray, vse no
vaine repetitions as the Heathen: for
they thinke to be heard for their much
babbling. 8 Be ye not like them therefore:
for your Father knoweth whereof ye haue
neede, before ye aske of him. 9 After
this maner therefore pray ye, Our father
which art in heauen, halowed be thy
name. 10 Thy Kingdome come. Thy will
be done euen in earth, as it is in heauen.
11 Giue vs this day our dayly bread. 12 And
forgiue vs our dettes, as we also forgiue
our detters. 13 And leade vs not into
tentation, but deliuer vs from euill: for
thine is the kingdome, and the power,
and the glorie for euer. Amen. 14 For
if ye doe forgiue men their trespasses,
your heauenly Father will also forgiue
you. 15 But if ye do not forgiue men
their trespasses,, no more will your father
forgiue you your trespaces. 16 Moreouer,
when ye fast, looke not sowre as the
hypocrites: for they disfigure their faces,
that they might seeme vnto men to fast.
Verely I say vnto you, that they haue
their rewarde. 17 But when thou fastest,
anoint thine head, and wash thy face,
18 That thou seeme not vnto men to fast,
but vnto thy Father which is in secret:
and thy Father which seeth in secret,
will rewarde thee openly. 19 Lay not vp
treasures for your selues vpon the earth,
where the mothe and canker corrupt, and
where theeues digge through and steale.
20 But lay vp treasures for your selues
in heauen, where neither the mothe nor
canker corrupteth, and where theeues
neither digge through, nor steale. 21 For
where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also. 22 The light of the body
is the eye: if then thine eye be single,
thy whole body shall be light. 23 But if
thine eye be wicked, then all thy body
shalbe darke. Wherefore if the light thatMatthew 6:24
837
is in thee, be darkenes, howe great is
that darkenesse? 24 No man can serue
two masters: for eyther he shall hate
the one, and loue the other, or els he
shall leane to the one, and despise the
other. Ye cannot serue God and riches.
25 Therefore I say vnto you, be not carefull
for your life, what ye shall eate, or what
ye shall drinke: nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more worth then meate? and the bodie
then raiment? 26 Behold the foules of
the heauen: for they sowe not, neither
reape, nor carie into the barnes: yet your
heauenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not
much better then they? 27 Which of you
by taking care is able to adde one cubite
vnto his stature? 28 And why care ye for
raiment? Learne howe the lilies of the
fielde doe growe: they are not wearied,
neither spinne: 29 Yet I say vnto you, that
euen Salomon in all his glorie was not
arayed like one of these. 30 Wherefore
if God so clothe the grasse of the fielde
which is to day, and to morowe is cast
into the ouen, shall he not doe much more
vnto you, O ye of litle faith? 31 Therefore
take no thought, saying, What shall we
eate? or what shall we drinke? or where
with shall we be clothed? 32 (For after all
these things seeke the Gentiles) for your
heauenly Father knoweth, that ye haue
neede of all these things. 33 But seeke
ye first the kingdome of God, and his
righteousnesse, and all these things shall
be ministred vnto you. 34 Care not then
for the morowe: for the morowe shall
care for it selfe: the day hath ynough with
his owne griefe.
7
1 Judge not, that ye be not iudged. 2 Eor
with what iudgement ye iudge, ye shall
be iudged, and with what measure ye
mete, it shall be measured to you againe.
3 And why seest thou the mote, that is in
thy brothers eye, and perceiuest not the
beame that is in thine owne eye? 4 Or
howe sayest thou to thy brother, Suffer
me to cast out the mote out of thine eye,
and beholde, a beame is in thine owne
eye? 5 Hypocrite, first cast out that beame
Matthew 7:22
out of thine owne eye, and then shalt
thou see clearely to cast out the mote
out of thy brothers eye. 6 Giue ye not
that which is holy, to dogges, neither
cast ye your pearles before swine, lest
they treade them vnder their feete, and
turning againe, all to rent you. 7 Aske,
and it shall be giuen you: seeke, and
ye shall finde: knocke, and it shall be
opened vnto you. 8 For whosoeuer asketh,
receiueth: and he, that seeketh, findeth:
and to him that knocketh, it shall be
opened. 9 For what man is there among
you, which if his sonne aske him bread,
woulde giue him a stone? 10 Or if he aske
fish, wil he giue him a serpent? 11 If ye
then, which are euill, can giue to your
children good giftes, howe much more
shall your Father which is in heauen,
giue good thinges to them that aske him?
12 Therefore whatsoeuer ye woulde that
men should doe to you, euen so doe ye
to them: for this is the Lawe and the
Prophets. 13 Enter in at the streight gate:
for it is the wide gate, and broade way
that leadeth to destruction: and many
there be which goe in thereat, 14 Because
the gate is streight, and the way narowe
that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there be
that finde it. 15 Beware of false prophets,
which come to you, in sheepes clothing,
but inwardly they are rauening wolues.
16 Ye shall know them by their fruites. Doe
men gather grapes of thornes? or figges
of thistles? 17 So euery good tree bringeth
foorth good fruite, and a corrupt tree
bringeth forth euill fruite. 18 A good tree
can not bring forth euil fruite: neither
can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruite.
19 Euery tree that bringeth not forth good
fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into
the fire. 20 Therefore by their fruites
ye shall knowe them. 21 Not euery one
that sayeth vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the kingdome of heauen, but
he that doeth my Fathers will which is
in heauen. 22 Many will say to me in
that day, Lord, Lord, haue we not by
thy Name prophecied? and by thy name
cast out deuils? and by thy name doneMatthew 7:23
838
many great workes? 23 And then will
I professe to them, I neuer knewe you:
depart from me, ye that worke iniquitie.
24 Whosoeuer then heareth of mee these
words, and doeth the same, I will liken
him to a wise man, which hath builded his
house on a rock: 25 And the raine fell, and
the floods came, and the windes blewe,
and beat vpon that house, and it fell not:
for it was grounded on a rocke. 26 But
whosoeuer heareth these my wordes, and
doeth them not, shall be likened vnto
a foolish man, which hath builded his
house vpon the sand: 27 And the raine
fell, and the floods came, and the windes
blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it
fell, and the fall thereof was great. 28 And
it came to passe, when Iesus had ended
these wordes, the people were astonied at
his doctrine. 29 For he taught them as one
hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes.
8
Nowe when he was come downe
from the mountaine, great multitudes
followed him. 2 And loe, there came
a Leper and worshipped him, saying,
Master, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
cleane. 3 And Iesus putting foorth his
hand, touched him, saying, I will, be thou
cleane: and immediatly his leprosie was
clensed. 4 Then Iesus saide vnto him, See
thou tell no man, but goe, and shewe
thy selfe vnto the Priest, and offer the
gift that Moses commanded, for a wit-
nesse to them. 5 When Iesus was entred
into Capernaum, there came vnto him a
Centurion, beseeching him, 6 And saide,
Master, my seruant lieth sicke at home of
the palsie, and is grieuously pained. 7 And
Iesus saide vnto him, I will come and
heale him. 8 But the Centurion answered,
saying, Master, I am not worthy that
thou shouldest come vnder my roofe: but
speake the worde onely, and my seruant
shall be healed. 9 For I am a man also
vnder the authoritie of an other, and haue
souldiers vnder me: and I say to one, Goe,
and he goeth: and to another, Come, and
he commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this,
and he doeth it. 10 When Iesus heard
that, he marueiled, and said to them that
1
Matthew 8:28
folowed him, Verely, I say vnto you, I
haue not found so great faith, euen in
Israel. 11 But I say vnto you, that many
shall come from the East and West, and
shall sit downe with Abraham, and Isaac,
and Iacob, in the kingdome of heauen.
12 And the children of the kingdome shall
be cast out into vtter darkenes: there
shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth.
13 Then Iesus saide vnto the Centurion,
Goe thy way, and as thou hast beleeued,
so be it vnto thee, And his seruant was
healed the same houre. 14 And when Iesus
came to Peters house, he sawe his wiues
mother layed downe, and sicke of a feuer.
15 And he touched her hande, and the
feuer left her: so she arose, and ministred
vnto them. 16 When the Euen was come,
they brought vnto him many that were
possessed with deuils: and he cast out the
spirits with his worde, and healed all that
were sicke, 17 That it might be fulfilled,
which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet,
saying, He tooke our infirmities, and bare
our sickenesses. 18 And when Iesus sawe
great multitudes of people about him, he
commanded them to goe ouer the water.
19 Then came there a certaine Scribe, and
said vnto him, Master, I will follow thee
whithersoeuer thou goest. 20 But Iesus
saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes,
and the birdes of the heauen haue nestes,
but the Sonne of man hath not whereon
to rest his head. 21 And another of his
disciples saide vnto him, Master, suffer
me first to goe, and burie my father. 22 But
Iesus said vnto him, Followe me, and let
the dead burie their dead. 23 And when
he was entred into ye ship, his disciples
followed him. 24 And beholde, there arose
a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship
was couered with waues: but he was a
sleepe. 25 Then his disciples came, and
awoke him, saying, Master, saue vs: we
perish. 26 And he said vnto them, Why are
ye fearefull, O ye of litle faith? Then he
arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea:
and so there was a great calme. 27 And
the men marueiled, saying, What man is
this, that both the windes and the sea
obey him! 28 And when he was come
to the other side into ye countrey of theMatthew 8:29
839
Gergesenes, there met him two possessed
with deuils, which came out of the graues
very fierce, so that no man might goe by
that way. 29 And beholde, they cryed out,
saying, Iesus the sonne of God, what haue
we to do with thee? Art thou come hither
to tormet vs before ye time? 30 Nowe
there was, afarre off from them, a great
heard of swine feeding. 31 And the deuils
besought him, saying, If thou cast vs out,
suffer vs to goe into the heard of swine.
32 And he said vnto them, Go. So they
went out and departed into the heard of
swine: and beholde, the whole heard of
swine ranne headlong into the sea, and
died in the water. 33 Then the heardmen
fled: and when they were come into the
citie, they tolde all things, and what was
become of them that were possessed with
the deuils. 34 And beholde, all ye citie
came out to meete Iesus: and when they
sawe him, they besought him to depart
out of their coastes.
9
1 Then hee entred into a shippe,
and
passed ouer, and came into his owne
citie. 2 And loe, they brought to him
a man sicke of the palsie, laid on a
bed. And Iesus seeing their faith, saide
to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, be of
good comfort: thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee. 3 And beholde, certaine of the
Scribes saide with themselues, This man
blasphemeth. 4 But when Iesus saw their
thoughts, he said, Wherefore thinke yee
euil things in your hearts? 5 For whether
is it easier to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee, or to say, Arise, and walke? 6 And
that ye may knowe that the Sonne of
man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue
sinnes, (then saide he vnto the sicke of
the palsie,) Arise, take vp thy bed, and
goe to thine house. 7 And hee arose, and
departed to his owne house. 8 So when
the multitude sawe it, they marueiled,
and glorified God, which had giuen such
authoritie to men. 9 And as Iesus passed
foorth from thence, hee sawe a man
sitting at the custome, named Matthewe,
and saide to him, Followe me. And he
Matthew 9:24
arose, and followed him. 10 And it came to
passe, as Iesus sate at meate in his house,
beholde, many Publicanes and sinners,
that came thither, sate downe at the table
with Iesus and his disciples. 11 And when
the Pharises sawe that, they saide to his
disciples, Why eateth your master with
Publicanes and sinners? 12 Nowe when
Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The
whole neede not a Physition, but they
that are sicke. 13 But goe yee and learne
what this is, I will haue mercie, and not
sacrifice: for I am not come to call the
righteous, but the sinners to repentance.
14 Then came the disciples of Iohn to him,
saying, Why doe we and the Pharises fast
oft, and thy disciples fast not? 15 And
Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children
of the marriage chamber mourne as long
as the bridegrome is with them? But the
daies will come, when the bridegrome
shall be taken from them, and then shall
they fast. 16 Moreouer no man pieceth
an olde garment with a piece of newe
cloth: for that that should fill it vp, taketh
away from the garment, and the breach is
worse. 17 Neither doe they put newe wine
into olde vessels: for then the vessels
would breake, and the wine woulde be
spilt, and the vessels shoulde perish: but
they put new wine into newe vessels, and
so are both preserued. 18 While hee thus
spake vnto them, beholde, there came
a certaine ruler, and worshipped him,
saying, My daughter is nowe deceased,
but come and laie thine hande on her, and
shee shall liue. 19 And Iesus arose and
followed him with his disciples. 20 (And
beholde, a woman which was diseased
with an issue of blood twelue yeres, came
behinde him, and touched the hemme of
his garment. 21 For shee saide in her
selfe, If I may touche but his garment
onely, I shalbe whole. 22 Then Iesus
turned him about, and seeing her, did say,
Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
hath made thee whole. And the woman
was made whole at that same moment.)
23 Nowe when Iesus came into the Rulers
house, and saw the minstrels and the
multitude making noise, 24 He said vnto
them, Get you hence: for the maid is notMatthew 9:25
840
dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him
to scorne. 25 And when the multitude
were put foorth, hee went in and tooke
her by the hande, and the maide arose.
26 And this bruite went throughout all that
lande. 27 And as Iesus departed thence,
two blinde men followed him, crying, and
saying, O sonne of Dauid, haue mercie
vpon vs. 28 And when hee was come into
the house, the blinde came to him, and
Iesus saide vnto them, Beleeue yee that
I am able to doe this? And they sayd
vnto him, Yea, Lord. 29 Then touched
he their eyes, saying, According to your
faith be it vnto you. 30 And their eyes
were opened, and Iesus gaue them great
charge, saying, See that no man knowe
31 But when they were departed,
it.
they spread abroad his fame throughout
all that land. 32 And as they went out,
beholde, they brought to him a domme
man possessed with a deuill. 33 And
when the deuill was cast out, the domme
spake: then the multitude marueiled,
saying, The like was neuer seene in Israel.
34 But the Pharises saide, He casteth
out deuils, through the prince of deuils.
35 And Iesus went about all cities and
townes, teaching in their Synagogues, and
preaching the Gospel of the kingdome,
and healing euery sickenesse and euery
disease among the people. 36 But when
he saw the multitude, he had compassion
vpon them, because they were dispersed,
and scattered abroade, as sheepe hauing
no shepheard. 37 Then saide he to his
disciples, Surely the haruest is great, but
the labourers are fewe. 38 Wherefore pray
the Lord of the haruest, that he woulde
sende foorth labourers into his haruest.
1 And
10
hee called his twelue disciples
vnto him, and gaue them power against
vncleane spirits, to cast them out, and
to heale euery sickenesse, and euery
disease. 2 Nowe the names of the twelue
Apostles are these. The first is Simon,
called Peter, and Andrew his brother:
Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn
his brother. 3 Philippe and Bartlemewe:
Matthew 10:22
Thomas, and Matthewe that Publicane:
Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Lebbeus
whose surname was Thaddeus: 4 Simon
the Cananite, and Iudas Iscariot, who also
betraied him. 5 These twelue did Iesus
send forth, and commanded them, saying,
Goe not into the way of of the Gentiles,
and into the cities of the Samaritans enter
yee not: 6 But goe rather to the lost sheepe
of the house of Israel. 7 And as ye goe,
preach, saying, The kingdome of heauen
is at hand. 8 Heale the sicke: cleanse the
lepers: raise vp the dead: cast out the
deuils. Freely ye haue receiued, freely
giue. 9 Possesse not golde, nor siluer, nor
money in your girdels, 10 Nor a scrippe for
the iourney, neither two coates, neither
shoes, nor a staffe: for the workeman
is worthie of his meate. 11 And into
whatsoeuer citie or towne ye shall come,
enquire who is worthy in it, and there
abide till yee goe thence. 12 And when
yee come into an house, salute the same.
13 And if the house be worthy, let your
peace come vpon it: but if it be not
worthie, let your peace returne to you.
14 And whosoeuer shall not receiue you,
nor heare your woordes, when yee depart
out of that house, or that citie, shake
off the dust of your feete. 15 Truely I
say vnto you, it shall be easier for them
of the lande of Sodom and Gomorrha in
the day of iudgement, then for that citie.
16 Behold, I send you as sheepe in the
middes of the wolues: be yee therefore
wise as serpents, and innocent as doues.
17 But beware of men, for they will deliuer
you vp to the Councils, and will scourge
you in their Synagogues. 18 And ye shall
be brought to the gouernours and Kings
for my sake, in witnes to them, and to
the Gentiles. 19 But when they deliuer
you vp, take no thought howe or what ye
shall speake: for it shall be giuen you in
that houre, what ye shall say. 20 For it
is not yee that speake, but the spirite of
your father which speaketh in you. 21 And
the brother shall betray the brother to
death, and the father the sonne, and the
children shall rise against their parents,
and shall cause them to die. 22 And yeeMatthew 10:23
841
shall be hated of all men for my Name:
but he that endureth to the end, he shall
be saued. 23 And when they persecute
you in this citie, flee into another: for
verely I say vnto you, yee shall not goe
ouer all the cities of Israel, till the Sonne
of man be come. 24 The disciple is not
aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue
his Lord. 25 It is ynough for the disciple to
bee as his master is, and the seruaunt as
his Lord. If they haue called the master of
the house Beel-zebub, howe much more
them of his housholde? 26 Feare them not
therefore: for there is nothing couered,
that shall not be disclosed, nor hid, that
shall not be knowen. 27 What I tell you
in darkenesse, that speake yee in light:
and what yee heare in the eare, that
preach yee on the houses. 28 And feare
yee not them which kill the bodie, but
are nor able to kill the soule: but rather
feare him, which is able to destroy both
soule and bodie in hell. 29 Are not two
sparrowes sold for a farthing, and one of
them shall not fal on the ground without
your Father? 30 Yea, and all the heares
of your head are nombred. 31 Feare ye
not therefore, yee are of more value then
many sparowes. 32 Whosoeuer therefore
shall confesse me before men, him will I
confesse also before my Father which is
in heauen. 33 But whosoeuer shall denie
me before me, him will I also denie before
my Father which is in heauen. 34 Thinke
not that I am come to sende peace into
the earth: I came not to send peace, but
the sworde. 35 For I am come to set a
man at variance against his father, and
the daughter against her mother, and the
daughter in law against her mother in
lawe. 36 And a mans enemies shall be
they of his owne housholde. 37 He that
loueth father or mother more then me,
is not worthie of me. And he that loueth
sonne, or daughter more then mee, is not
worthie of me. 38 And hee that taketh
not his crosse, and followeth after me, is
not worthie of me. 39 He that will finde
his life, shall lose it: and he that loseth
his life for my sake, shall finde it. 40 He
that receiueth you, receiueth me: and hee
that receiueth mee, receiueth him that
Matthew 11:14
hath sent me. 41 Hee that receiueth a
Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall
receiue a Prophetes rewarde: and hee
that receiueth a righteous man, in the
name of a righteous man, shall receiue
the rewarde of a righteous man. 42 And
whosoeuer shall giue vnto one of these
litle ones to drinke a cuppe of colde water
onely, in the name of a disciple, verely
I say vnto you, he shall not lose his
rewarde.
11
1 And it came to passe that when Iesus
had made an ende of commaunding his
twelue disciples, hee departed thence
to teache and to preach in their cities.
2 And when Iohn heard in the prison
the woorkes of Christ, he sent two of his
disciples, and sayde vnto him, 3 Art thou
he that shoulde come, or shall we looke
for another? 4 And Iesus answering, said
vnto them, Goe, and shewe Iohn, what
things ye heare, and see. 5 The blinde
receiue sight, and the halt doe walke: the
lepers are clensed, and the deafe heare,
the dead are raised vp, and the poore
receiue the Gospel. 6 And blessed is he
that shall not be offeded in me. 7 And as
they departed, Iesus beganne to speake
vnto the multitude, of Iohn, What went
ye out into the wildernes to see? A reede
shaken with the winde? 8 But what went
ye out to see? A man clothed in soft
raiment? Behold, they that weare soft
clothing, are in Kings houses. 9 But what
went ye out to see? A Prophet? Yea, I
say vnto you, and more then a Prophet.
10 For this is he of whom it is written,
Beholde, I send my messenger before thy
face, which shall prepare thy way before
thee. 11 Verely I say vnto you, among
them which are begotten of women, arose
there not a greater then Iohn Baptist:
notwithstanding, he that is the least in
the kingdome of heauen, is greater then
he. 12 And from the time of Iohn Baptist
hitherto, the kingdome of heauen suffer-
eth violence, and the violent take it by
force. 13 For all the Prophetes and the
Lawe prophecied vnto Iohn. 14 And if yeMatthew 11:15
842
will receiue it, this is that Elias, which was
to come. 15 He that hath eares to heare,
let him heare. 16 But whereunto shall I
liken this generation? It is like vnto litle
children which sit in the markets, and
call vnto their fellowes, 17 And say, We
haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not
daunced, we haue mourned vnto you, and
ye haue not lamented. 18 For Iohn came
neither eating nor drinking, and they say,
He hath a deuill. 19 The sonne of man
came eating and drinking, and they say,
Beholde a glutton and a drinker of wine,
a friend vnto Publicanes and sinners:
but wisedome is iustified of her children.
20 Then began he to vpbraide the cities,
wherein most of his great workes were
done, because they repented not. 21 Woe
be to thee, Chorazin: Woe be to thee,
Bethsaida: for if ye great workes, which
were done in you, had bene done in Tyrus
and Sidon, they had repented long agone
in sackecloth and ashes. 22 But I say
to you, It shalbe easier for Tyrus and
Sidon at the day of iudgement, then for
you. 23 And thou, Capernaum, which art
lifted vp vnto heauen, shalt be brought
downe to hell: for if the great workes,
which haue bin done in thee, had bene
done among them of Sodom, they had
remained to this day. 24 But I say vnto
you, that it shall be easier for them of the
land of Sodom in the day of iudgement,
25 At that time Iesus
then for thee.
answered, and saide, I giue thee thankes,
O Father, Lord of heauen and earth,
because thou hast hid these things from
the wise and men of vnderstanding, and
hast opened them vnto babes. 26 It is
so, O Father, because thy good pleasure
was such. 27 All things are giuen vnto me
of my Father: and no man knoweth the
Sonne, but ye Father: neither knoweth
any man ye Father, but the Sonne, and
he to whom ye Sonne will reueile him.
28 Come vnto me, all ye that are wearie
and laden, and I will ease you. 29 Take
my yoke on you, and learne of me that
I am meeke and lowly in heart: and ye
shall finde rest vnto your soules. 30 For
my yoke is easie, and my burden light.
Matthew 12:18
12
1 At that time Iesus went on a Sabbath
day through ye corne, and his disciples
were an hungred, and bega to plucke
ye eares of corne and to eate. 2 And
when the Pharises sawe it, they saide vnto
him, Beholde, thy disciples doe that which
is not lawfull to doe vpon the Sabbath.
3 But he said vnto them, Haue ye not
read what Dauid did when he was an
hungred, and they that were with him?
4 Howe he entred into ye house of God,
and did eate the shewe bread, which was
not lawfull for him to eate, neither for
them which were with him, but onely
for the Priestes? 5 Or haue ye not read
in the Lawe, how that on the Sabbath
dayes the Priestes in the Temple breake
the Sabbath, and are blameles? 6 But I
say vnto you, that here is one greater
then the Temple. 7 Wherefore if ye knewe
what this is, I will haue mercie, and not
sacrifice, ye would not haue condemned
the innocents. 8 For the sonne of man
is Lord, euen of the Sabbath. 9 And
he departed thence, and went into their
Synagogue: 10 And beholde, there was a
man which had his hand dried vp. And
they asked him, saying, Is it lawfull to
heale vpon a Sabbath day? that they
might accuse him. 11 And he said vnto
the, What man shall there be among you,
that hath a sheepe, and if it fal on a
Sabbath day into a pit, doth not take it
and lift it out? 12 How much more then is
a man better then a sheepe? therefore,
it is lawfull to doe well on a Sabbath
day. 13 Then said he to the man, Stretch
forth thine hand. And he stretched it
foorth, and it was made whole as the
other. 14 Then the Pharises went out,
and consulted against him, howe they
might destroy him. 15 But whe Iesus
knew it, he departed thece, and great
multitudes folowed him, and he healed
the al, 16 And charged them in threatning
wise, that they should not make him
knowen, 17 That it might be fulfilled,
which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet,
saying, 18 Behold my seruant whom I haue
chosen, my beloued in whom my soule
deliteth: I wil put my Spirit on him, andMatthew 12:19
843
he shall shewe iudgement to the Gentiles.
19 He shall not striue, nor crie, neither
shall any man heare his voyce in the
streetes. 20 A bruised reede shall he not
breake, and smoking flaxe shall he not
quenche, till he bring forth iudgement
vnto victorie. 21 And in his Name shall
the Gentiles trust. 22 Then was brought
to him one, possessed with a deuill, both
blind, and dumme, and he healed him, so
that he which was blind and dumme, both
spake and saw. 23 And all the people were
amased, and saide, Is not this that sonne
of Dauid? 24 But when the Pharises heard
it, they saide, This man casteth the deuils
no otherwise out, but through Beelzebub
the prince of deuils. 25 But Iesus knew
their thoughtes, and said to them, Eu-
ery kingdome deuided against it selfe, is
brought to nought: and euery citie or
house, deuided against it selfe, shall not
stand. 26 So if Satan cast out Satan, he is
deuided against himself: how shall then
his kingdom endure? 27 Also if I through
Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe
your children cast them out? Therefore
they shall be your iudges. 28 But if I
cast out deuils by ye Spirit of God, then
is the kingdome of God come vnto you.
29 Els howe can a man enter into a strong
mans house and spoyle his goods, except
he first bind the strong man, and then
spoile his house. 30 He that is not with
me, is against me: and he that gathereth
not with me, scattereth. 31 Wherefore I
say vnto you, euery sinne and blasphemie
shalbe forgiuen vnto men: but the blas-
phemie against the holy Ghost shall not
be forgiuen vnto men. 32 And whosoeuer
shall speake a word against the Sonne
of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but
whosoeuer shall speake against the holy
Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him, nei-
ther in this worlde, nor in the worlde to
come. 33 Either make the tree good, and
his fruite good: or els make the tree euill,
and his fruite euil: for the tree is knowen
by the fruite. 34 O generations of vipers,
howe can you speake good things, when
ye are euill? For of the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh. 35 A good
Matthew 12:49
man out of the good treasure of his heart
bringeth foorth good things: and an euill
man out of an euill treasure, bringeth
forth euill things. 36 But I say vnto you,
that of euery idle word that men shall
speake, they shall giue account thereof
at the day of iudgement. 37 For by thy
wordes thou shalt be iustified, and by thy
wordes thou shalt be condemned. 38 Then
answered certaine of ye Scribes and of
the Pharises, saying, Master, we would
see a signe of thee. 39 But he answered
and said to them, An euill and adulterous
generation seeketh a signe, but no signe
shall be giuen vnto it, saue that signe of
the Prophet Ionas. 40 For as Ionas was
three daies and three nights in the whales
belly: so shall the Sonne of man be three
daies and three nights in ye heart of the
earth. 41 The men of Nineue shall rise
in iudgement with this generation, and
condemne it: for they repented at the
preaching of Ionas: and behold, a greater
then Ionas is here. 42 The Queene of the
South shall rise in iudgement with this
generation, and shall condemne it: for
she came from the vtmost partes of the
earth to heare the wisdome of Salomon:
and beholde, a greater then Salomon is
here. 43 Nowe when the vncleane spirit is
gone out of a man, he walketh throughout
drie places, seeking rest, and findeth
none. 44 Then he saith, I wil returne into
mine house from whence I came: and
when he is come, he findeth it emptie,
swept and garnished. 45 Then he goeth,
and taketh vnto him seuen other spirites
worse then himselfe, and they enter in,
and dwell there: and the ende of that
man is worse then the beginning. Euen
so shall it be with this wicked generation.
46 While he yet spake to ye multitude,
beholde, his mother, and his brethren
stood without, desiring to speake with
him. 47 Then one said vnto him, Beholde,
thy mother and thy brethren stand with-
out, desiring to speake with thee. 48 But
he answered, and said to him that told
him, Who is my mother? and who are
my brethren? 49 And he stretched foorth
his hand toward his disciples, and said,Matthew 12:50
844
Beholde my mother and my brethren.
50 For whosoeuer shall doe my Fathers
will which is in heauen, the same is my
brother and sister and mother.
13
1 The same day went Iesus out of the
house, and sate by the sea side. 2 And
great multitudes resorted vnto him, so
that he went into a ship, and sate downe:
and the whole multitude stoode on the
shore. 3 Then he spake many things to
them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower
went forth to sowe. 4 And as he sowed,
some fell by the way side, and the foules
came and deuoured them vp. 5 And
some fell vpon stony grounde, where
they had not much earth, and anon they
sprong vp, because they had no depth
of earth. 6 And when the sunne was
vp, they were parched, and for lacke of
rooting, withered away. 7 And some fell
among thornes, and the thornes sprong
vp, and choked them. 8 Some againe fel
in good ground, and brought forth fruite,
one corne an hundreth folde, some sixtie
folde, and another thirtie folde. 9 He that
hath eares to heare, let him heare. 10 Then
the disciples came, and said to him,
Why speakest thou to them in parables?
11 And he answered, and said vnto them,
Because it is giuen vnto you, to know the
secretes of the kingdome of heauen, but to
the it is not giue. 12 For whosoeuer hath,
to him shalbe giuen, and he shall haue
abundance: but whosoeuer hath not,
from him shalbe taken away, euen that
he hath. 13 Therefore speake I to them
in parables, because they seeing, doe not
see: and hearing, they heare not, neither
vnderstand. 14 So in them is fulfilled
the prophecie of Esaias, which prophecie
saieth, By hearing, ye shall heare, and
shall not vnderstand, and seeing, ye shall
see, and shall not perceiue. 15 For this
peoples heart is waxed fat, and their eares
are dull of hearing, and with their eyes
they haue winked, lest they should see
with their eyes, and heare with their
eares, and should vnderstand with their
hearts, and should returne, that I might
Matthew 13:30
heale them. 16 But blessed are your eyes,
for they see: and your eares, for they
heare. 17 For verely I say vnto you, that
many Prophets, and righteous men haue
desired to see those things which ye see,
and haue not seene them, and to heare
those things which ye heare, and haue
not heard them. 18 Heare ye therefore
ye parable of ye sower. 19 Whensoeuer
any man heareth the woorde of that king-
dome, and vnderstandeth it not, that euil
one commeth, and catcheth away that
which was sowen in his heart: and this is
he which hath receiued the seede by the
way side. 20 And hee that receiued seede
in the stonie grounde, is he which heareth
the woorde, and incontinently with ioy
receiueth it, 21 Yet hath he no roote in
himselfe, and dureth but a season: for as-
soone as tribulation or persecution com-
meth because of the woorde, by and by he
is offended. 22 And hee that receiued the
seede among thornes, is hee that heareth
the woorde: but the care of this worlde,
and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the
word, and he is made vnfruitfull. 23 But
he that receiued the seede in the good
ground, is he that heareth the worde,
and vnderstandeth it, which also beareth
fruite, and bringeth foorth, some an hun-
dreth folde, some sixtie folde, and some
thirtie folde. 24 Another parable put hee
foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome
of heauen is like vnto a man which sowed
good seede in his fielde. 25 But while
men slept, there came his enemie, and
sowed tares among the wheat, and went
his waie. 26 And when the blade was
sprong vp, and brought forth fruite, then
appeared the tares also. 27 Then came
the seruaunts of the housholder, and sayd
vnto him, Master, sowedst not thou good
seede in thy fielde? from whence then
hath it tares? 28 And hee said to them,
Some enuious man hath done this. Then
the seruants saide vnto him, Wilt thou
then that we go and gather them vp?
29 But he saide, Nay, lest while yee goe
about to gather the tares, yee plucke
vp also with them the wheat. 30 Let
both growe together vntill the haruest,
and in time of haruest I will say to theMatthew 13:31
reapers, Gather yee first the tares, and
binde them in sheaues to burne them:
but gather the wheate into my barne.
31 Another parable he put foorth vnto
them, saying, The kingdome of heauen
is like vnto a graine of mustard seede,
which a man taketh and soweth in his
fielde: 32 Which in deede is the least of
all seedes: but when it is growen, it is the
greatest among herbes, and it is a tree,
so that the birdes of heauen come and
builde in the branches thereof. 33 Another
parable spake hee to them, The kingdome
of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a
woman taketh and hideth in three pecks
of meale, till all be leauened. 34 All these
thinges spake Iesus vnto the multitude in
parables, and without parables spake he
not to them, 35 That it might be fulfilled,
which was spoken by the Prophet, saying,
I will open my mouth in parables, and
will vtter the thinges which haue beene
kept secrete from the foundation of the
worlde. 36 Then sent Iesus the multitude
away, and went into the house. And his
disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare
vnto vs the parable of the tares of that
fielde. 37 Then answered he, and saide
to them, He that soweth the good seede,
is the Sonne of man. 38 And the field
is the worlde, and the good seede are
the children of the kingdome, and the
tares are the children of that wicked one.
39 And the enemie that soweth them, is
the deuill, and the haruest is the end
of the worlde, and the reapers be the
Angels. 40 As then the tares are gathered
and burned in ye fire, so shall it be in
the end of this world. 41 The Sonne
of man shall send forth his Angels, and
they shall gather out of his kingdom all
things that offend, and them which doe
iniquitie, 42 And shall cast them into a
fornace of fire. There shalbe wailing
and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then shall
the iust men shine as ye sunne in the
kingdome of their Father. Hee that hath
eares to heare, let him heare. 44 Againe,
the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a
treasure hid in ye field, which when a
man hath found, he hideth it, and for ioy
thereof departeth and selleth all that he
845
Matthew 14:5
hath, and buieth that field. 45 Againe, the
kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant
man, that seeketh good pearles, 46 Who
hauing found a pearle of great price, went
and solde all that he had, and bought it.
47 Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like
vnto a drawe net cast into the sea, that
gathereth of all kindes of things. 48 Which,
when it is full, men draw to lande, and
sit and gather the good into vessels, and
cast the bad away. 49 So shall it be at the
end of the world. The Angels shall goe
foorth, and seuer the bad from among
the iust, 50 And shall cast them into a
fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and
gnashing of teeth. 51 Iesus saide vnto
them, Vnderstand yee all these things?
They saide vnto him, Yea, Lord. 52 Then
sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery
Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome
of heauen, is like vnto an householder,
which bringeth foorth out of his treasure
things both newe and olde. 53 And it came
to passe, that when Iesus had ended these
parables, he departed thence, 54 And came
into his owne countrey, and taught them
in their Synagogue, so that they were
astonied, and saide, Whence commeth
this wisdome and great woorkes vnto this
man? 55 Is not this the carpenters sonne?
Is not his mother called Marie, and his
brethren Iames and Ioses, and Simon and
Iudas? 56 And are not his sisters all
with vs? Whence then hath he all these
things? 57 And they were offended with
him. Then Iesus said to them, A Prophet
is not without honour, saue in his owne
countrey, and in his owne house. 58 And
he did not many great woorkes there, for
their vnbeliefes sake.
14
At that time Herod the Tetrarche
heard of the fame of Iesus, 2 And sayde
vnto his seruaunts, This is that Iohn Bap-
tist, hee is risen againe from the deade,
and therefore great woorkes are wrought
by him. 3 For Herod had taken Iohn,
and bounde him, and put him in prison
for Herodias sake, his brother Philips
wife. 4 For Iohn saide vnto him, It is
not lawfull for thee to haue her. 5 And
1Matthew 14:6
846
when hee woulde haue put him to death,
hee feared the multitude, because they
counted him as a Prophet. 6 But when
Herods birth day was kept, the daughter
of Herodias daunced before them, and
pleased Herod. 7 Wherefore he promised
with an othe, that he would giue her
whatsoeuer she would aske. 8 And shee
being before instructed of her mother,
sayde, Giue mee here Iohn Baptists head
in a platter. 9 And the King was sorie:
neuerthelesse because of the othe, and
them that sate with him at the table, he
commanded it to be giuen her, 10 And
sent, and beheaded Iohn in the prison.
11 And his head was brought in a platter,
and giuen to the maide, and shee brought
it vnto her mother. 12 And his disciples
came, and tooke vp the bodie, and buried
it, and went, and tolde Iesus. 13 And when
Iesus heard it, hee departed thence by
shippe into a desert place apart. And
when the multitude had heard it, they
followed him on foote out of the cities.
14 And Iesus went foorth and sawe a
great multitude, and was mooued with
compassion toward them, and he healed
their sicke. 15 And when euen was come,
his disciples came to him, saying, This is
a desart place, and the time is alreadie
past: let the multitude depart, that they
may goe into the townes, and bye them
vitailes. 16 But Iesus saide to them, They
haue no neede to goe away: giue yee them
to eate. 17 Then saide they vnto him, Wee
haue here but fiue loaues, and two fishes.
18 And he saide, Bring them hither to me.
19 And hee commanded the multitude to
sit downe on the grasse, and tooke the
fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looked
vp to heauen and blessed, and brake, and
gaue the loaues to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude. 20 And they
did all eate, and were sufficed, and they
tooke vp of the fragments that remained,
twelue baskets full. 21 And they that had
eaten, were about fiue thousande men,
beside women and litle children. 22 And
straightway Iesus compelled his disciples
to enter into a shippe, and to goe ouer
before him, while he sent the multitude
Matthew 15:4
away. 23 And assoone as hee had sent
the multitude away, he went vp into a
moutaine alone to pray: and when the
euening was come, hee was there alone.
24 And the shippe was nowe in the middes
of the sea, and was tossed with waues: for
it was a contrarie winde. 25 And in the
fourth watch of the night, Iesus went vnto
them, walking on the sea. 26 And when
his disciples sawe him walking on the sea,
they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit,
and cried out for feare. 27 But straight
way Iesus spake vnto them, saying, Be
of good comfort, It is I: be not afraide.
28 Then Peter answered him, and saide,
Master, if it be thou, bid me come vnto
thee on the water. 29 And he saide, Come.
And when Peter was come downe out
of the shippe, he walked on the water,
to goe to Iesus. 30 But when he sawe
a mightie winde, he was afraide: and
as he began to sinke, he cried, saying,
Master, saue me. 31 So immediatly Iesus
stretched foorth his hande, and caught
him, and saide to him, O thou of litle faith,
wherefore diddest thou doubt? 32 And
assoone as they were come into the ship,
the winde ceased. 33 Then they that were
in the ship, came and worshipped him,
saying, Of a trueth thou art the Sonne of
God. 34 And when they were come ouer,
they came into the land of Gennezaret.
35 And when the men of that place knewe
him, they sent out into all that countrey
rounde about, and brought vnto him all
that were sicke, 36 And besought him,
that they might touch the hemme of his
garment onely: and as many as touched
it, were made whole.
15
1 Then came to Iesus the Scribes and
Pharises, which were of Hierusalem, say-
ing, 2 Why do thy disciples transgresse
the tradition of the Elders? for they
wash not their hands when they eate
bread. 3 But he answered and said vnto
them, Why doe yee also transgresse the
commandement of God by your tradi-
tion? 4 For God hath commanded, saying,
Honour thy father and mother: and heMatthew 15:5
847
that curseth father or mother, let him
die the death. 5 But ye say, Whosoeuer
shall say to father or mother, By the
gift that is offered by me, thou maiest
haue profite, 6 Though hee honour not his
father, or his mother, shalbe free: thus
haue ye made the commandement of God
of no aucthoritie by your tradition. 7 O
hypocrites, Esaias prophecied well of you,
saying, 8 This people draweth neere vnto
me with their mouth, and honoureth me
with the lips, but their heart is farre off
from me. 9 But in vaine they worship
me, teaching for doctrines, mens pre-
cepts. 10 Then hee called the multitude
vnto him, and said to them, Heare and
vnderstand. 11 That which goeth into
the mouth, defileth not the man, but
that which commeth out of the mouth,
that defileth the man. 12 Then came his
disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest
thou not, that the Pharises are offended
in hearing this saying? 13 But hee an-
swered and saide, Euery plant which
mine heauenly Father hath not planted,
shalbe rooted vp. 14 Let them alone, they
be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and
if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall
fall into the ditche. 15 Then answered
Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs
this parable. 16 Then said Iesus, Are ye yet
without vnderstanding? 17 Perceiue ye
not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the
mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast
out into the draught? 18 But those thinges
which proceede out of the mouth, come
from the heart, and they defile the man.
19 For out of the heart come euil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
false testimonies, slaunders. 20 These
are the things, which defile the man:
but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth
not ye man. 21 And Iesus went thence,
and departed into the coastes of Tyrus
and Sidon. 22 And beholde, a woman a
Cananite came out of the same coasts,
and cried, saying vnto him, Haue mercie
on me, O Lord, the sonne of Dauid: my
daughter is miserably vexed with a deuil.
23 But hee answered her not a worde.
Then came to him his disciples, and
Matthew 15:39
besought him, saying, Sende her away, for
she crieth after vs. 24 But he answered,
and said, I am not sent, but vnto the
lost sheepe of the house of Israel. 25 Yet
she came, and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, helpe me. 26 And he answered, and
said, It is not good to take the childrens
bread, and to cast it to whelps. 27 But
she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the
whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall
from their masters table. 28 Then Iesus
answered, and saide vnto her, O woman,
great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou
desirest. And her daughter was made
whole at that houre. 29 So Iesus went
away from thence, and came neere vnto
the sea of Galile, and went vp into a
mountaine and sate downe there. 30 And
great multitudes came vnto him, hauing
with them, halt, blinde, dumme, maymed,
and many other, and cast them downe at
Iesus feete, and he healed them. 31 In so
much that the multitude wondered, to see
the dumme speake, the maimed whole,
the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and
they glorified the God of Israel. 32 Then
Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and
said, I haue compassion on this multitude,
because they haue continued with mee
already three dayes, and haue nothing to
eate: and I wil not let them depart fasting,
least they faint in the way. 33 And his
disciples saide vnto him, Whence should
we get so much bread in the wildernes, as
should suffice so great a multitude! 34 And
Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues
haue ye? And they said, Seuen, and a
few litle fishes. 35 Then he commanded
the multitude to sit downe on the ground,
36 And tooke the seuen loaues, and the
fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them,
and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples
to the multitude. 37 And they did all
eate, and were sufficed: and they tooke
vp of the fragments that remained, seuen
baskets full. 38 And they that had eaten,
were foure thousand men, beside women,
and litle children. 39 Then Iesus sent away
the multitude, and tooke ship, and came
into the partes of Magdala.Matthew 16:1
848
16
1 Then came the Pharises and Sadduces,
and did tempt him, desiring him to shew
them a signe from heauen. 2 But he
answered, and said vnto them, When it
is euening, ye say, Faire wether: for ye
skie is red. 3 And in the morning ye
say, To day shall be a tempest: for the
skie is red and lowring. O hypocrites,
ye can discerne the face of the skie, and
can ye not discerne the signes of the
times? 4 The wicked generation, and
adulterous seeketh a signe, but there shall
no signe be giuen it, but that signe of
the Prophet Ionas: so hee left them, and
departed. 5 And when his disciples were
come to the other side, they had forgotten
to take bread with them. 6 Then Iesus
said vnto them, Take heede and beware of
the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces.
7 And they reasoned among themselues,
saying, It is because we haue brought no
bread. 8 But Iesus knowing it, saide vnto
them, O ye of litle faith, why reason you
thus among your selues, because ye haue
brought no bread? 9 Doe ye not yet per-
ceiue, neither remember the fiue loaues,
when there were fiue thousand men, and
how many baskets tooke ye vp? 10 Neither
the seuen loaues when there were foure
thousande men, and howe many baskets
tooke ye vp? 11 Why perceiue ye not
that I said not vnto you concerning bread,
that ye shoulde beware of the leauen
of the Pharises and Sadduces? 12 Then
vnderstood they that he had not said
that they should beware of the leauen of
bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharises,
and Sadduces. 13 Nowe when Iesus came
into the coastes of Cesarea Philippi, hee
asked his disciples, saying, Whome doe
men say that I, the sonne of man am?
14 And they said, Some say, Iohn Baptist:
and some, Elias: and others, Ieremias, or
one of the Prophets. 15 He said vnto them,
But whome say ye that I am? 16 Then
Simon Peter answered, and said, Thou
art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing
God. 17 And Iesus answered, and saide to
him, Blessed art thou, Simon, the sonne
of Ionas: for flesh and blood hath not
reueiled it vnto thee, but my Father which
Matthew 17:3
is in heauen. 18 And I say also vnto thee,
that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke
I will builde my Church: and ye gates
of hell shall not ouercome it. 19 And I
will giue vnto thee the keyes of the king-
dome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou
shalt binde vpon earth, shalbe bound
in heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt
loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen.
20 Then hee charged his disciples, that
they should tell no man that he was Iesus
that Christ. 21 From that time foorth
Iesus beganne to shewe vnto his disciples,
that he must goe vnto Hierusalem, and
suffer many thinges of the Elders, and
of the hie Priestes, and Scribes, and be
slaine, and be raised againe the thirde
day. 22 Then Peter tooke him aside, and
began to rebuke him, saying, Master, pitie
thy selfe: this shall not be vnto thee.
23 Then he turned backe, and said vnto
Peter, Get thee behinde me, Satan: thou
art an offence vnto me, because thou
vnderstandest not the thinges that are
of God, but the thinges that are of men.
24 Iesus then saide to his disciples, If
any man will follow me, let him forsake
himselfe: and take vp his crosse, and
follow me. 25 For whosoeuer will saue
his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer shall
lose his life for my sake, shall finde it.
26 For what shall it profite a man though
he should winne the whole worlde, if hee
lose his owne soule? or what shall a
man giue for recompence of his soule?
27 For the Sonne of man shall come in the
glory of his Father with his Angels, and
then shall he giue to euery man according
to his deedes. 28 Verely I say vnto you,
there bee some of them that stande here,
which shall not taste of death, till they
haue seene the Sonne of man come in his
kingdome.
17
1 And after sixe dayes, Iesus tooke Peter,
and Iames and Iohn his brother, and
brought them vp into an hie mountaine
apart, 2 And was transfigured before
them: and his face did shine as the Sunne,
and his clothes were as white as the
light. 3 And beholde, there appeared vntoMatthew 17:4
849
them Moses, and Elias, talking with him.
4 Then answered Peter, and saide to Iesus,
Master, it is good for vs to be here: if thou
wilt, let vs make here three tabernacles,
one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
for Elias. 5 While he yet spake, behold,
a bright cloude shadowed them: and
beholde, there came a voyce out of the
cloude, saying, This is that my beloued
Sonne, in whom I am well pleased: heare
him. 6 And when the disciples heard that,
they fell on their faces, and were sore
afraide. 7 Then Iesus came and touched
them, and said, Arise, and be not afraide.
8 And when they lifted vp their eyes, they
sawe no man, saue Iesus onely. 9 And
as they came downe from the moutaine,
Iesus charged them, saying, Shewe the
vision to no man, vntil the Sonne of man
rise againe from the dead. 10 And his
disciples asked him, saying, Why then say
the Scribes that Elias must first come?
11 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto
them, Certeinely Elias must first come,
and restore all thinges. 12 But I say vnto
you that Elias is come alreadie, and they
knewe him not, but haue done vnto him
whatsoeuer they would: likewise shall
also the Sonne of man suffer of them.
13 Then the disciples perceiued that he
spake vnto them of Iohn Baptist. 14 And
when they were come to the multitude,
there came to him a certaine man, and
fell downe at his feete, 15 And saide,
Master, haue pitie on my sonne: for he
is lunatike, and is sore vexed: for oft
times he falleth into the fire, and oft times
into the water. 16 And I brought him to
thy disciples, and they could not heale
him. 17 Then Iesus answered, and said, O
generation faithlesse, and crooked, how
long now shall I be with you! howe
long nowe shall I suffer you! bring him
hither to me. 18 And Iesus rebuked the
deuill, and he went out of him: and the
childe was healed at that houre. 19 Then
came the disciples to Iesus apart, and
said, Why could not we cast him out?
20 And Iesus said vnto them, Because of
your vnbeliefe: for verely I say vnto you,
if ye haue faith as much as is a graine
of mustarde seede, ye shall say vnto this
Matthew 18:8
mountaine, Remooue hence to yonder
place, and it shall remoue: and nothing
shalbe vnpossible vnto you. 21 Howbeit
this kinde goeth not out, but by prayer
and fasting. 22 And they being in Galile,
Iesus said vnto them, The Sonne of man
shall be deliuered into the handes of men,
23 And they shall kill him, but the thirde
day shall he rise againe: and they were
very sorie. 24 And when they were come
to Capernaum, they that receiued polle
money, came to Peter, and sayd, Doeth
not your Master pay polle money? 25 He
sayd, Yes. And when he was come into
the house, Iesus preuented him, saying,
What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whome
doe the Kings of the earth take tribute,
or polle money? of their children, or
of strangers? 26 Peter sayd vnto him, Of
strangers. Then said Iesus vnto him, Then
are the children free. 27 Neuerthelesse,
lest we should offend them: goe to the
sea, and cast in an angle, and take the
first fish that commeth vp, and when thou
hast opened his mouth, thou shalt finde a
piece of twentie pence: that take, and giue
it vnto them for me and thee.
18
1 The same time the disciples came vnto
Iesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the
kingdome of heauen? 2 And Iesus called
a litle childe vnto him, and set him in the
mids of them, 3 And sayd, Verely I say vnto
you, except ye be conuerted, and become
as litle children, ye shall not enter into
the kingdome of heauen. 4 Whosoeuer
therefore shall humble himselfe as this
litle childe, the same is the greatest in the
kingdome of heauen. 5 And whosoeuer
shall receiue one such litle childe in my
name, receiueth me. 6 But whosoeuer
shall offend one of these litle ones which
beleeue in me, it were better for him,
that a milstone were hanged about his
necke, and that he were drowned in the
depth of the sea. 7 Wo be vnto the world
because of offences: for it must needes
be that offences shall come, but wo be to
that man by whome the offence commeth.
8 Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foote
cause thee to offend, cut them off, andMatthew 18:9
850
cast them from thee: it is better for thee
to enter into life, halt, or maimed, then
hauing two hands, or two feete, to be
cast into euerlasting fire. 9 And if thine
eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out,
and cast it from thee: it is better for
thee to enter into life with one eye, then
hauing two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
10 See that ye despise not one of these
litle ones: for I say vnto you, that in
heauen their Angels alwayes behold the
face of my Father which is in heauen.
11 For the Sonne of man is come to saue
that which was lost. 12 How thinke ye?
If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and
one of them be gone astray, doeth he
not leaue ninetie and nine, and go into
the mountaines, and seeke that which is
gone astray? 13 And if so be that he finde
it, verely I say vnto you, he reioyceth
more of that sheepe, then of the ninetie
and nine which went not astray: 14 So
is it not ye wil of your Father which is
in heauen, that one of these litle ones
should perish. 15 Moreouer, if thy brother
trespasse against thee, goe and tell him
his fault betweene thee and him alone:
if he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy
brother. 16 But if he heare thee not, take
yet with thee one or two, that by the
mouth of two or three witnesses euery
worde may be confirmed. 17 And if he
refuse to heare them, tell it vnto the
Church: and if he refuse to heare the
Church also, let him be vnto thee as an
heathen man, and a Publicane. 18 Verely
I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer ye bind on
earth, shall be bound in heauen: and
whatsoeuer ye loose on earth, shalbe
loosed in heauen. 19 Againe, verely I say
vnto you, that if two of you shall agree
in earth vpon any thing, whatsoeuer they
shall desire, it shall be giuen them of my
Father which is in heauen. 20 For where
two or three are gathered together in my
Name, there am I in the mids of them.
21 Then came Peter to him, and said,
Master, howe oft shall my brother sinne
against me, and I shall forgiue him? vnto
seuen times? 22 Iesus said vnto him, I say
not to thee, Vnto seuen times, but, Vnto
seuentie times seuen times. 23 Therefore
Matthew 19:4
is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto
a certaine King, which would take an
account of his seruants. 24 And when he
had begun to reckon, one was brought
vnto him, which ought him ten thousand
talents. 25 And because he had nothing
to pay, his Lord commanded him to be
solde, and his wife, and his children, and
all that he had, and the dette to be payed.
26 The seruant therefore fell downe, and
worshipped him, saying, Lord, refraine
thine anger toward me, and I will pay
thee all. 27 Then that seruants Lord had
compassion, and loosed him, and forgaue
him the dette. 28 But when the seruant
was departed, hee found one of his felow
seruants, which ought him an hundred
pence, and he layde hands on him, and
thratled him, saying, Pay me that thou
owest. 29 Then his fellow seruant fell
downe at his feete, and besought him,
saying, Refraine thine anger towards me,
and I will pay thee all. 30 Yet he would
not, but went and cast him into prison,
till he should pay the dette. 31 And when
his other felowe seruants sawe what was
done, they were very sory, and came,
and declared vnto their Lord all that was
done. 32 Then his Lord called him vnto
him, and sayd to him, O euil seruant, I
forgaue thee all that dette, because thou
prayedst me. 33 Oughtest not thou also
to haue had pitie on thy fellowe seruant,
euen as I had pitie on thee? 34 So his
Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the
tormentours, till he should pay all that
was due to him. 35 So likewise shall mine
heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye
forgiue from your hearts, eche one to his
brother their trespasses.
19
1 And it came to passe, that when Iesus
had finished these sayings, he departed
from Galile, and came into ye coasts
of Iudea beyond Iordan. 2 And great
multitudes followed him, and he healed
them there. 3 Then came vnto him the
Pharises tempting him, and saying to
him, Is it lawfull for a man to put away
his wife vpon euery occasion? 4 And
he answered and sayd vnto them, HaueMatthew 19:5
851
ye not read, that hee which made them
at the beginning, made them male and
female, 5 And sayd, For this cause, shall a
man leaue father and mother, and cleaue
vnto his wife, and they which were two
shalbe one flesh. 6 Wherefore they are no
more twaine, but one flesh. Let not man
therefore put asunder that, which God
hath coupled together. 7 They said to him,
Why did then Moses commaund to giue a
bill of diuorcement, and to put her away?
8 He sayd vnto them, Moses, because of
the hardnesse of your heart, suffered you
to put away your wiues: but from the
beginning it was not so. 9 I say therefore
vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away
his wife, except it be for whoredome,
and marry another, committeth adulterie:
and whosoeuer marieth her which is di-
uorced, doeth commit adulterie. 10 Then
sayd his disciples to him, If the matter
be so betweene man and wife, it is not
good to marry. 11 But he sayd vnto them,
All men cannot receiue this thing, saue
they to whom it is giuen. 12 For there
are some eunuches, which were so borne
of their mothers belly: and there be
some eunuches, which be gelded by men:
and there be some eunuches, which haue
gelded them selues for the kingdome of
heauen. He that is able to receiue this,
let him receiue it. 13 Then were brought
to him litle children, that he should put
his hands on them, and pray: and the
disciples rebuked them. 14 But Iesus sayd,
Suffer the litle children, and forbid them
not to come to me: for of such is the
kingdome of heauen. 15 And when he
had put his hands on them, he departed
thence. 16 And beholde, one came and
sayd vnto him, Good Master, what good
thing shall I doe, that I may haue eternall
life? 17 And he said vnto him, Why callest
thou me good? there is none good but
one, eue God: but if thou wilt enter into
life, keepe ye commandemets. 18 He sayd
to him, Which? And Iesus sayde, These,
Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit
adulterie: Thou shalt not steale: Thou
shalt not beare false witnesse. 19 Honour
thy father and mother: and thou shalt
loue thy neighbour as thy selfe. 20 The
Matthew 20:6
yong man sayd vnto him, I haue obserued
all these things from my youth: what
lacke I yet? 21 Iesus sayd vnto him, If thou
wilt be perfite, go, sell that thou hast, and
giue it to the poore, and thou shalt haue
treasure in heauen, and come, and follow
me. 22 And when the yong man heard that
saying, he went away sorowfull: for he
had great possessions. 23 Then Iesus sayd
vnto his disciples, Verely I say vnto you,
that a rich man shall hardly enter into
the kingdome of heauen. 24 And againe
I say vnto you, It is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle, then
for a rich man to enter into ye kingdome
of God. 25 And whe his disciples heard
it, they were exceedingly amased, saying,
Who then can be saued? 26 And Iesus
behelde them, and sayde vnto them, With
men this is vnpossible, but with God all
things are possible. 27 Then answered
Peter, and said to him, Beholde, we haue
forsaken all, and followed thee: what
therefore shall we haue? 28 And Iesus said
vnto them, Verely I say to you, that when
the Sonne of man shall sit in the throne of
his maiestie, ye which folowed me in the
regeneration, shall sit also vpon twelue
thrones and iudge the twelue tribes of
Israel. 29 And whosoeuer shall forsake
houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
for my Names sake, he shall receiue an
hundreth folde more, and shall inherite
euerlasting life. 30 But many that are first,
shalbe last, and the last shalbe first.
1 For
20
the kingdome of heauen is like
vnto a certaine, housholder, which went
out at the dawning of the day to hire
labourers into his vineyarde. 2 And he
agreed with the labourers for a peny a
day, and sent them into his vineyard.
3 And he went out about the third houre,
and sawe other standing idle in the mar-
ket place, 4 And sayd vnto them, Goe ye
also into my vineyard, and whatsoeuer
is right, I will giue you: and they went
their way. 5 Againe he went out about
the sixt and ninth houre, and did likewise.
6 And he went about the eleuenth houre,Matthew 20:7
852
and found other standing idle, and sayd
vnto them, Why stand ye here all the day
idle? 7 They sayd vnto him, Because no
man hath hired vs. He sayd to them, Goe
ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoeuer
is right, that shall ye receiue. 8 And
when euen was come, the master of
the vineyard sayd vnto his steward, Call
the labourers, and giue them their hire,
beginning at the last, till thou come to the
first. 9 And they which were hired about
ye eleuenth houre, came and receiued
euery man a penie. 10 Nowe when the
first came, they supposed that they should
receiue more, but they likewise receiued
euery man a penie. 11 And when they had
receiued it, they murmured against the
master of the house, 12 Saying, These last
haue wrought but one houre, and thou
hast made them equall vnto vs, which
haue borne the burden and heate of the
day. 13 And hee answered one of them,
saying, Friend, I doe thee no wrong: didst
thou not agree with me for a penie?
14 Take that which is thine owne, and go
thy way: I will giue vnto this last, as
much as to thee. 15 Is it not lawfull for
me to do as I will with mine owne? Is
thine eye euil, because I am good? 16 So
the last shalbe first, and the first last:
for many are called, but fewe chosen.
17 And Iesus went vp to Hierusalem, and
tooke the twelue disciples apart in the
way, and said vnto them, 18 Beholde, wee
goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of
man shall bee deliuered vnto the chiefe
priestes, and vnto the Scribes, and they
shall condemne him to death, 19 And shall
deliuer him to the Gentiles, to mocke, and
to scourge, and to crucifie him, but the
third day he shall rise againe. 20 Then
came to him the mother of Zebedeus
children with her sonnes, worshipping
him, and desiring a certaine thing of him.
21 And he said vnto her, What wouldest
thou? She said to him, Graunt that these
my two sonnes may sit, the one at thy
right hand, and the other at thy left hand
in thy kingdome. 22 And Iesus answered
and said, Ye know not what ye aske.
Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I
Matthew 21:3
shall drinke of, and to be baptized with
the baptisme that I shalbe baptized with?
They said to him, We are able. 23 And he
said vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede
of my cup, and shall be baptized with the
baptisme, that I am baptized with, but to
sit at my right hande, and at my left hand,
is not mine to giue: but it shalbe giuen
to them for whome it is prepared of my
Father. 24 And when the other ten heard
this, they disdained at the two brethren.
25 Therefore Iesus called them vnto him,
and saide, We knowe that the lordes of the
Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and
they that are great, exercise authoritie
ouer them. 26 But it shall not be so among
you: but whosoeuer will be great among
you, let him be your seruant. 27 And
whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let
him be your seruant. 28 Euen as the
Sonne of man came not to be serued,
but to serue, and to giue his life for
the ransome of many. 29 And as they
departed from Iericho, a great multitude
followed him. 30 And beholde, two blinde
men, sitting by the way side, when they
heard that Iesus passed by, cryed, saying,
O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie
on vs. 31 And the multitude rebuked them,
because they should holde their peace:
but they cried the more, saying, O Lord,
the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.
32 Then Iesus stoode still, and called them,
and said, What will ye that I should do to
you? 33 They saide to him, Lord, that our
eyes may be opened. 34 And Iesus mooued
with compassion, touched their eyes, and
immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and
they followed him.
21
And when they drewe neere to
Hierusalem, and were come to Beth-
phage, vnto the mount of the Oliues,
then sent Iesus two disciples, 2 Saying to
them, Goe into the towne that is ouer
against you, and anon yee shall finde an
asse bounde, and a colt with her: loose
them, and bring them vnto me. 3 And
if any man say ought vnto you, say ye,
that the Lord hath neede of them, and
1Matthew 21:4
853
straightway he will let them goe. 4 All
this was done that it might be fulfilled,
which was spoken by the Prophet, saying,
5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Beholde,
thy King commeth vnto thee, meeke and
sitting vpon an asse, and a colte, the
foale of an asse vsed to the yoke. 6 So
the disciples went, and did as Iesus had
commanded them, 7 And brought the
asse and the colt, and put on them their
clothes, and set him thereon. 8 And a
great multitude spred their garments in
the way: and other cut downe branches
from the trees, and strawed them in the
way. 9 Moreouer, the people that went
before, and they also that followed, cried,
saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid,
Blessed be hee that commeth in the Name
of the Lord, Hosanna thou which art in
the highest heauens. 10 And when he was
come into Hierusalem, all the citie was
mooued, saying, Who is this? 11 And the
people said, This is Iesus that Prophet of
Nazareth in Galile. 12 And Iesus went
into the Temple of God, and cast out all
them that solde and bought in the Temple,
and ouerthrew the tables of the money
chagers, and the seates of them that sold
doues, 13 And said to them, it is written,
My house shall be called the house of
prayer: but ye haue made it a denne of
theeues. 14 Then the blinde, and the halt
came to him in the Temple, and he healed
them. 15 But when the chiefe priestes and
Scribes sawe the marueiles that hee did,
and the children crying in the Temple,
and saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of
Dauid, they disdained, 16 And said vnto
him, Hearest thou what these say? And
Iesus said vnto them, Yea: read ye neuer,
By the mouth of babes and sucklings thou
hast made perfite the praise? 17 So hee
left them, and went out of the citie vnto
Bethania, and lodged there. 18 And in the
morning, as he returned into the citie, he
was hungrie, 19 And seeing a figge tree
in the way, he came to it, and found
nothing thereon, but leaues onely, and
said to it, Neuer fruite grow on thee
henceforwards. And anon the figge tree
withered. 20 And when his disciples saw
Matthew 21:33
it, they marueiled, saying, How soone is
the figge tree withered! 21 And Iesus
answered and said vnto them, Verely I
say vnto you, if ye haue faith, and doubt
not, ye shall not only doe that, which
I haue done to the figge tree, but also
if ye say vnto this mountaine, Take thy
selfe away, and cast thy selfe into the
sea, it shalbe done. 22 And whatsoeuer
ye shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye
shall receiue it. 23 And whe he was come
into the Temple, the chiefe Priestes, and
the Elders of the people came vnto him,
as he was teaching, and saide, By what
authoritie doest thou these things? and
who gaue thee this authoritie? 24 Then
Iesus answered and said vnto them, I also
will aske of you a certaine thing, which
if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by
what authoritie I doe these things. 25 The
baptisme of Iohn, whence was it? from
heauen, or of men? Then they reasoned
among themselues, saying, If we shall say,
From heauen, he will say vnto vs, Why
did ye not then beleeue him? 26 And if
we say, Of men, we feare the multitude,
for all holde Iohn as a Prophet. 27 Then
they answered Iesus, and said, We can
not tell. And he said vnto them, Neither
tell I you by what authoritie I doe these
things. 28 But what thinke ye? A certaine
man had two sonnes, and came to the
elder, and saide, Sonne, goe and worke to
day in my vineyarde. 29 But he answered,
and said, I will not: yet afterward he
repented himselfe, and went. 30 Then
came he to the second, and said likewise.
And he answered, and said, I will, Syr:
yet he went not. 31 Whether of them
twaine did the will of the father? They
saide vnto him, The first. Iesus saide
vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, that
the Publicanes and the harlots goe before
you into the kingdome of God. 32 For
Iohn came vnto you in the way of righ-
teousnes, and yee beleeued him not: but
the Publicanes, and the harlots beleeued
him, and ye, though ye sawe it, were not
mooued with repentance afterward, that
ye might beleeue him. 33 Heare another
parable, There was a certaine housholder,Matthew 21:34
854
which planted a vineyard, and hedged
it round about, and made a winepresse
therein, and built a tower, and let it out
to husbandmen, and went into a strange
countrey. 34 And when the time of the
fruite drewe neere, hee sent his seruants
to the husbandmen to receiue the fruites
thereof. 35 And ye husbandmen tooke his
seruants and beat one, and killed another,
and stoned another. 36 Againe hee sent
other seruants, moe then the first: and
they did the like vnto them. 37 But last
of all he sent vnto them his owne sonne,
saying, They will reuerence my sonne.
38 But when the husbandmen saw the
sonne, they saide among themselues, This
is the heire: come, let vs kill him, and
let vs take his inheritance. 39 So they
tooke him, and cast him out of the vine-
yarde, and slewe him. 40 When therefore
the Lord of the vineyarde shall come,
what will hee doe to those husbandmen?
41 They saide vnto him, Hee will cruelly
destroy those wicked men, and will let
out his vineyard vnto other husbandmen,
which shall deliuer him the fruites in
their seasons. 42 Iesus saide vnto them,
Read ye neuer in the Scriptures, The stone
which the builders refused, the same is
made the head of the corner? This was
the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in
our eyes. 43 Therefore say I vnto you, The
kingdome of God shalbe taken from you,
and shalbe giuen to a nation, which shall
bring foorth the fruites thereof. 44 And
whosoeuer shall fall on this stone, he
shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it
shall fall, it will dash him a pieces. 45 And
when the chiefe Priestes and Pharises had
heard his parables, they perceiued that
hee spake of them. 46 And they seeking
to laye handes on him, feared the people,
because they tooke him as a Prophet.
22
1 Then Iesus answered, and spake vnto
them againe in parables, saying, 2 The
kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine
King which maried his sonne, 3 And sent
foorth his seruants, to call them that were
bidde to the wedding, but they woulde
not come. 4 Againe hee sent foorth other
Matthew 22:21
seruants, saying. Tell them which are
bidden, Beholde, I haue prepared my din-
ner: mine oxen and my fatlings are killed,
and all thinges are readie: come vnto the
mariage. 5 But they made light of it, and
went their wayes, one to his farme, and
another about his marchandise. 6 And
the remnant tooke his seruants, and in-
treated them sharpely, and slewe them.
7 But when the King heard it, he was
wroth, and sent foorth his warriers, and
destroyed those murtherers, and burnt
vp their citie. 8 Then saide hee to his
seruants, Truely the wedding is prepared:
but they which were bidden, were not
worthy. 9 Go ye therefore out into the
high wayes, and as many as ye finde,
bid them to the mariage. 10 So those
seruantes went out into the hie wayes,
and gathered together all that euer they
found, both good and bad: so the wedding
was furnished with ghestes. 11 Then the
King came in, to see the ghestes, and
sawe there a man which had not on a
wedding garment. 12 And he sayd vnto
him, Friend, how camest thou in hither,
and hast not on a wedding garment? And
he was speachlesse. 13 Then sayd the
King to the seruants, Binde him hand
and foote: take him away, and cast him
into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping
and gnashing of teeth. 14 For many are
called, but fewe chosen. 15 Then went
the Pharises and tooke counsell how they
might tangle him in talke. 16 And they
sent vnto him their disciples with the
Herodians, saying, Master, we knowe that
thou art true, and teachest the way of
God truely, neither carest for any man:
for thou considerest not the person of
men. 17 Tell vs therefore, how thinkest
thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto
Cesar, or not? 18 But Iesus perceiued their
wickednes, and sayd, Why tempt ye me,
ye hypocrites? 19 Shewe me the tribute
money. And they brought him a peny.
20 And he sayde vnto them, Whose is this
image and superscription? 21 They sayd
vnto him, Cesars. Then sayd he vnto
them, Giue therefore to Cesar, the things
which are Cesars, and giue vnto God,Matthew 22:22
855
those things which are Gods. 22 And when
they heard it, they marueiled, and left
him, and went their way. 23 The same day
the Sadduces came to him (which say that
there is no resurrection) and asked him,
24 Saying, Master, Moses sayd, If a man
die, hauing no children, his brother shall
marie his wife by the right of alliance, and
raise vp seede vnto his brother. 25 Nowe
there were with vs seuen brethren, and
the first maried a wife, and deceased: and
hauing none yssue, left his wife vnto his
brother. 26 Likewise also the second, and
the third, vnto the seuenth. 27 And last
of all the woman died also. 28 Therefore
in the resurrection, whose wife shall she
be of the seuen? for all had her. 29 Then
Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye
are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures,
nor the power of God. 30 For in the
resurrection they neither marie wiues,
nor wiues are bestowed in mariage, but
are as the Angels of God in heauen. 31 And
concerning the resurrection of the dead,
haue ye not read what is spoken vuto
you of God, saying, 32 I am the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Iacob? God is not the God
of the dead, but of the liuing. 33 And
when the multitude heard it, they were
astonied at his doctrine. 34 But when
the Pharises had heard, that he had put
the Sadduces to silence, they assembled
together. 35 And one of them, which
was an expounder of the Lawe, asked
him a question, tempting him, and saying,
36 Master, which is ye great commande-
ment in the Lawe? 37 Iesus sayd to him,
Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with
all thine heart, with all thy soule, and
with all thy minde. 38 This is the first
and the great commandement. 39 And the
second is like vnto this, Thou shalt loue
thy neighbour as thy selfe. 40 On these
two commandements hangeth the whole
Lawe, and the Prophets. 41 While the
Pharises were gathered together, Iesus
asked them, 42 Saying, What thinke ye of
Christ? whose sonne is he? They sayd
vnto him, Dauids. 43 He sayd vnto them,
How then doeth Dauid in spirit call him
Matthew 23:15
Lord, saying, 44 The Lord sayd to my Lord,
Sit at my right hand, till I make thine
enemies thy footestoole? 45 If then Dauid
call him Lord, howe is he his sonne?
46 And none could answere him a worde,
neither durst any from that day foorth
aske him any moe questions.
1 Then
23
spake Iesus to the multitude,
and to his disciples, 2 Saying, The Scribes
and the Pharises sit in Moses seate. 3 All
therefore whatsoeuer they bid you ob-
serue, that obserue and doe: but after
their workes doe not: for they say, and
doe not. 4 For they binde heauie burdens,
and grieuous to be borne, and lay them
on mens shoulders, but they themselues
will not moue them with one of their
fingers. 5 All their workes they doe for
to be seene of men: for they make their
phylacteries broad, and make long the
frindges of their garments, 6 And loue
the chiefe place at feastes, and to haue
the chiefe seates in the assemblies, 7 And
greetings in the markets, and to be called
of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. 8 But be not ye
called, Rabbi: for one is your doctour, to
wit, Christ, and all ye are brethren. 9 And
call no man your father vpon the earth:
for there is but one, your father which is
in heauen. 10 Be not called doctours: for
one is your doctour, euen Christ. 11 But
he that is greatest among you, let him
be your seruant. 12 For whosoeuer will
exalt himselfe, shall be brought lowe: and
whosoeuer will humble himselfe, shalbe
exalted. 13 Wo therefore be vnto you,
Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites, because
ye shut vp the kingdome of heauen be-
fore men: for ye your selues go not in,
neither suffer ye them that would enter,
to come in. 14 Wo be vnto you, Scribes
and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye deuoure
widowes houses, euen vnder a colour of
long prayers: wherefore ye shall receiue
the greater damnation. 15 Wo be vnto you,
Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye
compasse sea and land to make one of
your profession: and when he is made,
ye make him two folde more the childe ofMatthew 23:16
hell, then you your selues. 16 Wo be vnto
you blinde guides, which say, Whosoeuer
sweareth by the Temple, it is nothing:
but whosoeuer sweareth by the golde of
the Temple, he offendeth. 17 Ye fooles
and blinde, whether is greater, the golde,
or the Temple that sanctifieth the golde?
18 And whosoeuer sweareth by the altar,
it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth
by the offering that is vpon it, offendeth.
19 Ye fooles and blinde, whether is greater,
the offering, or the altar which sanctifieth
the offering? 20 Whosoeuer therefore
sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and
by all things thereon. 21 And whosoeuer
sweareth by the Temple, sweareth by it,
and by him that dwelleth therein. 22 And
he that sweareth by heauen, sweareth
by the throne of God, and by him that
sitteth thereon. 23 Wo be to you, Scribes
and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye tithe
mynt, and annyse, and cummyn, and
leaue the weightier matters of the law,
as iudgement, and mercy and fidelitie.
These ought ye to haue done, and not to
haue left the other. 24 Ye blinde guides,
which straine out a gnat, and swallowe
a camell. 25 Wo be to you, Scribes and
Pharises, hypocrites: for ye make cleane
the vtter side of the cup, and of the
platter: but within they are ful of briberie
26 Thou blinde Pharise,
and excesse.
cleanse first the inside of the cup and
platter, that the outside of them may be
cleane also. 27 Wo be to you, Scribes and
Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are like vnto
whited tombes, which appeare beautifull
outward, but are within full of dead mens
bones, and all filthines. 28 So are ye also:
for outwarde ye appeare righteous vnto
men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie
and iniquitie. 29 Wo be vnto you, Scribes
and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye build
the tombes of the Prophets, and garnish
the sepulchres of the righteous, 30 And
say, If we had bene in the dayes of our
fathers, we would not haue bene partners
with them in the blood of the Prophets.
31 So then ye be witnesses vnto your
selues, that ye are the children of them
856
Matthew 24:7
that murthered the Prophets. 32 Fulfill
ye also ye measure of your fathers. 33 O
serpents, the generation of vipers, howe
should ye escape the damnation of hell!
34 Wherefore beholde, I send vnto you
Prophets, and wise men, and Scribes, and
of them ye shall kill and crucifie: and of
them shall ye scourge in your Synagogues,
and persecute from citie to citie, 35 That
vpon you may come all the righteous
blood that was shed vpon the earth,
from the blood of Abel the righteous,
vnto the blood of Zacharias the sonne
of Barachias, whome ye slewe betweene
the Temple and the altar. 36 Verely I
say vnto you, all these things shall come
37 Hierusalem,
vpon this generation.
Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets,
and stonest them which are sent to thee,
how often would I haue gathered thy
children together, as the henne gathereth
her chickins vnder her wings, and ye
would not! 38 Beholde, your habitation
shalbe left vnto you desolate, 39 For I say
vnto you, ye shall not see mee henceforth
till that ye say, Blessed is he that commeth
in the Name of the Lord.
1 And
24
Iesus went out, and departed
from the Temple, and his disciples came
to him, to shewe him the building of the
Temple. 2 And Iesus sayd vnto them,
See ye not all these things? Verely I say
vnto you, there shall not be here left a
stone vpon a stone, that shall not be cast
downe. 3 And as he sate vpon the mount
of Oliues, his disciples came vnto him
apart, saying, Tell vs when these things
shall be, and what signe shalbe of thy
comming, and of the ende of the world.
4 And Iesus answered, and sayd vnto
them, Take heede that no man deceiue
you. 5 For many shall come in my name,
saying, I am Christ, and shall deceiue
many. 6 And ye shall heare of warres,
and rumours of warres: see that ye be
not troubled: for all these things must
come to passe, but the end is not yet.
7 For nation shall rise against nation, and
realme against realme, and there shalbeMatthew 24:8
857
famine, and pestilence, and earthquakes
in diuers places. 8 All these are but
ye beginning of sorowes. 9 Then shall
they deliuer you vp to be afflicted, and
shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of
all nations for my Names sake. 10 And
then shall many be offended, and shall
betray one another, and shall hate one
another. 11 And many false prophets shall
arise, and shall deceiue many. 12 And
because iniquitie shalbe increased, the
loue of many shalbe colde. 13 But he that
endureth to the ende, he shalbe saued.
14 And this Gospel of the kingdome shalbe
preached through the whole world for a
witnes vnto all nations, and then shall
the end come. 15 When ye therefore shall
see the abomination of desolation spoken
of by Daniel the Prophet, set in the holy
place (let him that readeth consider it.)
16 Then let them which be in Iudea, flee
into the mountaines. 17 Let him which
is on the house top, not come downe to
fetch any thing out of his house. 18 And
he that is in the fielde, let not him returne
backe to fetch his clothes. 19 And woe
shalbe to them that are with childe, and
to them that giue sucke in those dayes.
20 But pray that your flight be not in the
winter, neither on the Sabbath day. 21 For
then shall be great tribulation, such as
was not from the beginning of the worlde
to this time, nor shalbe. 22 And except
those dayes should be shortened, there
should no flesh be saued: but for the
elects sake those dayes shalbe shortened.
23 Then if any shall say vnto you, Loe,
here is Christ, or there, beleeue it not.
24 For there shall arise false Christes,
and false prophets, and shall shewe great
signes and wonders, so that if it were
possible, they should deceiue the very
elect. 25 Beholde, I haue tolde you before.
26 Wherefore if they shall say vnto you,
Beholde, he is in the desert, goe not forth:
Beholde, he is in the secret places, beleeue
it not. 27 For as the lightning commeth
out of the East, and is seene into the
West, so shall also the comming of the
Sonne of man be. 28 For wheresoeuer
a dead carkeis is, thither will the Egles
Matthew 24:45
be gathered together. 29 And immediatly
after ye tribulations of those dayes, shall
the sunne be darkened, and the moone
shall not giue her light, and the starres
shall fal from heauen, and ye powers of
heaue shalbe shake. 30 And then shall
appeare the signe of the Sonne of man
in heauen: and then shall all the kinreds
of the earth mourne, and they shall see
the Sonne of man come in the cloudes
of heauen with power and great glorie.
31 And he shall send his Angels with a
great sound of a trumpet, and they shall
gather together his elect, from the foure
windes, and from the one ende of the
heauens vnto the other. 32 Now learne the
parable of the figge tree: when her bough
is yet tender, and it putteth foorth leaues,
ye knowe that sommer is neere. 33 So
likewise ye, when ye see all these things,
know that the kingdom of God is neere,
eue at ye doores. 34 Verely I say vnto
you, this generation shall not passe, till all
these things be done. 35 Heauen and earth
shall passe away: but my wordes shall not
passe away. 36 But of that day and houre
knoweth no man, no not the Angels of
heauen, but my father only. 37 But as the
dayes of Noe were, so likewise shall the
comming of the Sonne of man be. 38 For as
in the dayes before the flood, they did eate
and drinke, marrie, and giue in mariage,
vnto the day that Noe entred into the
Arke, 39 And knewe nothing, till the flood
came, and tooke them all away, so shall
also the comming of the Sonne of man
be. 40 Then two shall be in the fieldes, the
one shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe
refused. 41 Two women shalbe grinding at
ye mill: the one shalbe receiued, and the
other shalbe refused. 42 Watch therefore:
for ye knowe not what houre your master
will come. 43 Of this be sure, that if the
good man of the house knewe at what
watch the thiefe would come, he woulde
surely watch, and not suffer his house
to be digged through. 44 Therefore be
ye also ready: for in the houre that ye
thinke not, will the Sonne of man come.
45 Who then is a faithfull seruaunt and
wise, whom his master hath made ruler
ouer his household, to giue them meate inMatthew 24:46
858
season? 46 Blessed is that seruant, whom
his master when he commeth, shall finde
so doing. 47 Verely I say vnto you, he shall
make him ruler ouer all his goods. 48 But
if that euil seruant shall say in his heart,
My master doth deferre his comming,
49 And begin to smite his fellowes, and
to eate, and to drinke with the drunken,
50 That seruaunts master will come in a
day, when he looketh not for him, and in
an houre that he is not ware of, 51 And
will cut him off, and giue him his portion
with hypocrites: there shalbe weeping,
and gnashing of teeth.
25
1 Then the kingdome of heauen shalbe
likened vnto tenne virgins, which tooke
their lampes, and went foorth to meete
the bridegrome. 2 And fiue of them were
wise, and fiue foolish. 3 The foolish tooke
their lampes, but tooke none oyle with
them. 4 But the wise tooke oyle in their
vessels with their lampes. 5 Nowe while
the bridegrome taried long, all slumbred
and slept. 6 And at midnight there was
a crie made, Behold, the bridegrome
commeth: goe out to meete him. 7 Then
all those virgins arose, and trimmed their
lampes. 8 And the foolish said to the wise,
Giue vs of your oyle, for our lampes are
out. 9 But the wise answered, saying, Not
so, lest there will not be ynough for vs and
you: but goe ye rather to them that sell,
and bye for your selues. 10 And while they
went to bye, the bridegrome came: and
they that were readie, went in with him
to the wedding, and the gate was shut.
11 Afterwards came also the other virgins,
saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs. 12 But he
answered, and said, Verely I say vnto you,
I knowe you not. 13 Watch therfore: for
ye know neither the day, nor the houre,
when the sonne of man will come. 14 For
the kingdome of heauen is as a man that
going into a strange countrey, called his
seruants, and deliuered to them his goods.
15 And vnto one he gaue fiue talents, and
to an other two, and to another one,
to euery man after his own ability, and
straightway went from home. 16 Then
Matthew 25:31
he that had receiued the fiue talents,
went and occupied with them, and gained
other fiue talents. 17 Likewise also, he that
receiued two, he also gained other two.
18 But he that receiued that one, went
and digged it in the earth, and hid his
masters money. 19 But after a long season,
the master of those seruants came, and
reckoned with them. 20 Then came he that
had receiued fiue talents, and brought
other fiue talents, saying, Master, thou
deliueredst vnto me fiue talents: behold, I
haue gained with them other fiue talents.
21 Then his master saide vnto him, It
is well done good seruant and faithfull,
Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will
make thee ruler ouer much: enter into
thy masters ioy. 22 Also he that had
receiued two talents, came, and said,
Master, thou deliueredst vnto me two
talents: behold, I haue gained two other
talets more. 23 His master saide vnto him,
It is well done good seruant, and faithfull,
Thou hast bene faithfull in litle, I will
make thee ruler ouer much: enter into
thy masters ioy. 24 Then he which had
receiued the one talent, came, and said,
Master, I knewe that thou wast an hard
man, which reapest where thou sowedst
not, and gatherest where thou strawedst
not: 25 I was therefore afraide, and went,
and hid thy talent in the earth: behold,
thou hast thine owne. 26 And his master
answered, and said vnto him, Thou euill
seruant, and slouthfull, thou knewest that
I reape where I sowed not, and gather
where I strawed not. 27 Thou oughtest
therefore to haue put my money to ye
exchangers, and then at my comming
should I haue receiued mine owne with
vantage. 28 Take therefore the talent from
him, and giue it vnto him which hath
tenne talents. 29 For vnto euery man that
hath, it shall be giuen, and he shall haue
abundance, and from him that hath not,
euen that he hath, shalbe taken away.
30 Cast therefore that vnprofitable seruant
into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping
and gnasshing of teeth. 31 And when
the Sonne of man commeth in his glory,
and all the holy Angels with him, then
shall he sit vpon the throne of his glorie,Matthew 25:32
32 And
859
before him shalbe gathered all
nations, and he shall seperate them one
from another, as a shepheard separateth
the sheepe from ye goates. 33 And he
shall set the sheepe on his right hand,
and the goates on the left. 34 Then shall
ye king say to them on his right hand,
Come ye blessed of my father: take the
inheritance of the kingdome prepared for
you from the foundation of the world.
35 For I was an hungred, and ye gaue
me meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me
drinke: I was a stranger, and ye tooke
me in vnto you. 36 I was naked, and ye
clothed me: I was sicke, and ye visited
me: I was in prison, and ye came vnto
me. 37 Then shall the righteous answere
him, saying, Lord, when sawe we thee an
hungred, and fed thee? or a thirst, and
gaue thee drinke? 38 And when sawe we
thee a stranger, and tooke thee in vnto
vs? or naked, and clothed thee? 39 Or
when sawe we thee sicke, or in prison,
and came vnto thee? 40 And the King shall
answere, and say vnto them, Verely I say
vnto you, in as much as ye haue done it
vnto one of the least of these my brethre,
ye haue done it to me. 41 Then shall he say
vnto them on ye left hand, Depart from
me ye cursed, into euerlasting fire, which
is prepared for the deuill and his angels.
42 For I was an hungred, and ye gaue me
no meate: I thirsted, and ye gaue me no
drinke: 43 I was a stranger, and ye tooke
me not in vnto you: I was naked, and ye
clothed me not: sicke, and in prison, and
ye visited me not. 44 Then shall they also
answere him, saying, Lord, when sawe
we thee an hungred, or a thirst, or a
stranger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison,
and did not minister vnto thee? 45 Then
shall he answere them, and say, Verely I
say vnto you, in as much as ye did it not
to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
me. 46 And these shall goe into euerlasting
paine, and the righteous into life eternall.
Matthew 26:21
vnto his disciples, 2 Ye know that after
two dayes is ye Passeouer, and the Sonne
of man shalbe deliuered to be crucified.
3 Then assembled together the chiefe
Priests, and the Scribes, and the Elders
of ye people into the hall of the high
Priest called Caiaphas: 4 And consulted
together that they might take Iesus by
subtiltie, and kill him. 5 But they sayd,
Not on the feast day, least any vprore be
among the people. 6 And when Iesus was
in Bethania, in the house of Simon the
leper, 7 There came vnto him a woman,
which had a boxe of very costly oyntment,
and powred it on his head, as he sate at
the table. 8 And when his disciples sawe
it, they had indignation, saying, What
needed this waste? 9 For this oyntment
might haue bene solde for much, and
bene giuen to the poore. 10 And Iesus
knowing it, sayde vnto them, Why trouble
yee the woman? for shee hath wrought a
good woorke vpon me. 11 For yee haue
the poore alwayes with you, but me shall
yee not haue alwaies. 12 For in that shee
powred this oyntment on my bodie, shee
did it to burie me. 13 Verely I say vnto
you, wheresoeuer this Gospel shall bee
preached throughout all the worlde, there
shall also this that shee hath done, be
spoken of for a memoriall of her. 14 Then
one of the twelue, called Iudas Iscariot,
went vnto the chiefe Priestes, 15 And said,
What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer
him vnto you?
and they appoynted
vnto him thirtie pieces of siluer. 16 And
from that time, he sought opportunitie
to betraie him. 17 Nowe on the first
day of the feast of vnleauened bread the
disciples came to Iesus, saying vnto him,
Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee
to eate the Passeouer? 18 And he said,
Goe yee into the citie to such a man, and
say to him, The master saieth, My time
is at hande: I will keepe the Passeouer
at thine house with my disciples. 19 And
the disciples did as Iesus had giuen them
charge, and made readie the Passeouer.
20 So when the Euen was come, hee sate
26
1 And it came to passe, when Iesus downe with the twelue. 21 And as they
had finished all these sayings, he saide did eate, he sayde, Verely I say vntoMatthew 26:22
860
you, that one of you shall betraie me.
22 And they were exceeding sorowfull,
and began euery one of them to say vnto
him, Is it I, Master? 23 And hee answered
and sayde, Hee that dippeth his hande
with me in the dish, hee shall betraie me.
24 Surely the Sonne of man goeth his way,
as it is written of him: but woe be to
that man, by whom the Sonne of man is
betrayed: it had bene good for that man,
if hee had neuer bene borne. 25 Then
Iudas which betraied him, answered and
sayde, Is it I, Master? He sayde vnto him,
Thou hast sayd it. 26 And as they did eate,
Iesus tooke the bread, and when he had
blessed, he brake it, and gaue it to the
disciples, and sayd, Take, eate: this is my
bodie. 27 Also he tooke the cuppe, and
when he had giuen thankes, he gaue it
them, saying, Drinke ye all of it. 28 For
this is my blood of the Newe Testament,
that is shedde for many, for the remission
of sinnes. 29 I say vnto you, that I will
not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the
vine vntil that day, when I shall drinke it
new with you in my Fathers kingdome.
30 And when they had sung a Psalme,
they went out into the mount of Oliues.
31 Then saide Iesus vnto them, All yee
shall be offended by me this night: for it
is written, I wil smite the shepheard, and
the sheepe of the flocke shalbe scattered.
32 But after I am risen againe, I will
go before you into Galile. 33 But Peter
aunswered, and sayde vnto him, Though
that al men should be offended by thee,
yet will I neuer be offended. 34 Iesus
sayde vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee,
that this night, before the cocke crow,
thou shalt denie me thrise. 35 Peter saide
vnto him, Though I should die with thee,
I will in no case denie thee. Likewise also
sayd all the disciples. 36 Then went Iesus
with them into a place which is called
Gethsemane, and said vnto his disciples,
Sit ye here, while I goe, and pray yonder.
37 And hee tooke vnto him Peter, and the
two sonnes of Zebedeus, and began to
waxe sorowfull, and grieuously troubled.
38 Then sayde Iesus vnto them, My soule
is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie
Matthew 26:55
yee here, and watch with me. 39 So hee
went a litle further, and fell on his face,
and praied, saying, O my Father, if it
be possible, let this cup passe from me:
neuerthelesse, not as I will, but as thou
wilt. 40 After, hee came vnto the disciples,
and founde them a sleepe, and sayde to
Peter, What? coulde yee not watch with
me one houre? 41 Watch, and praie, that
yee enter not into tentation: the spirit in
deede is readie, but the flesh is weake.
42 Againe he went away the second time,
and praied, saying, O my Father, if this
cuppe can not passe away from mee, but
that I must drinke it, thy will be done.
43 And he came, and founde them a sleepe
againe, for their eyes were heauie. 44 So
he left them and went away againe, and
praied the third time, saying the same
woordes. 45 Then came he to his disciples,
and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth,
and take your rest: behold, the houre is at
hand, and the Sonne of man is giuen into
the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let vs goe:
beholde, hee is at hande that betraieth
me. 47 And while hee yet spake, loe
Iudas, one of the twelue, came, and with
him a great multitude with swordes and
staues, from the high Priests and Elders
of the people. 48 Now he that betraied
him, had giuen them a token, saying,
Whomesoeuer I shall kisse, that is he, laie
holde on him. 49 And forthwith he came
to Iesus, and sayd, God saue thee, Master,
and kissed him. 50 Then Iesus sayde vnto
him, Friende, wherefore art thou come?
Then came they, and laide hands on Iesus,
and tooke him. 51 And behold, one of
them which were with Iesus, stretched
out his hand, and drewe his sworde, and
strooke a seruaunt of the high Priest,
and smote off his eare. 52 Then sayde
Iesus vnto him, Put vp thy sworde into
his place: for all that take the sworde,
shall perish with the sworde. 53 Either
thinkest thou, that I can not now pray
to my Father, and he will giue me moe
then twelue legions of Angels? 54 Howe
then shoulde the Scriptures bee fulfilled,
which say, that it must be so? 55 The same
houre sayde Iesus to the multitude, Ye beMatthew 26:56
861
come out as it were against a thiefe, with
swordes and staues to take mee: I sate
daily teaching in the Temple among you,
and yee tooke me not. 56 But all this was
done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets
might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
forsooke him, and fled. 57 And they tooke
Iesus, and led him to Caiaphas the hie
Priest, where the Scribes and the Elders
were assembled. 58 And Peter followed
him a farre off vnto the hie Priestes hall,
and went in, and sate with the seruants to
see the ende. 59 Nowe the chiefe Priestes
and the Elders, and all the whole councill
sought false witnesse against Iesus, to put
him to death. 60 But they founde none,
and though many false witnesses came,
yet founde they none: but at the last came
two false witnesses, 61 And saide, This
man saide, I can destroie the Temple of
God, and build it in three daies. 62 Then
the chiefe Priest arose, and sayde to him,
Answerest thou nothing? What is the
matter that these men witnesse against
thee? 63 But Iesus helde his peace. Then
the chiefe Priest answered, and saide to
him, I charge thee sweare vnto vs by the
liuing God, to tell vs, If thou be that Christ
the Sonne of God, or no. 64 Iesus saide
to him, Thou hast saide it: neuerthelesse
I say vnto you, hereafter shall ye see
the Sonne of man, sitting at the right
hande of the power of God, and come
in the cloudes of the heauen. 65 Then
the hie Priest rent his clothes, saying,
Hee hath blasphemed, what haue wee
any more neede of witnesses? beholde:
nowe yee haue heard his blasphemie.
66 What thinke yee? They answered, and
said, He is guiltie of death. 67 Then spet
they in his face, and buffeted him, and
other smote him with roddes, 68 Saying,
Prophecie to vs, O Christ, Who is he that
smote thee? 69 Peter sate without in the
hall, and a maide came to him, saying,
Thou also wast with Iesus of Galile: 70 But
hee denied before them all, saying, I
wote not what thou saiest. 71 And when
hee went out into the porche, another
maide sawe him, and sayde vnto them
that were there, This man was also with
Iesus of Nazareth. 72 And againe he
Matthew 27:13
denied with an othe, saying, I knowe
not the man. 73 So after a while, came
vnto him they that stoode by, and sayde
vnto Peter, Surely thou art also one of
them: for euen thy speache bewraieth
thee. 74 Then began hee to curse himselfe,
and to sweare, saying, I knowe not the
man. And immediately the cocke crewe.
75 Then Peter remembred the wordes of
Iesus, which had sayde vnto him, Before
the cocke crowe thou shalt denie me
thrise. So he went out, and wept bitterly.
1 When
27
the morning was come, all
the chiefe Priests, and the elders of the
people tooke counsell against Iesus, to
put him to death, 2 And led him away
bounde, and deliuered him vnto Pontius
Pilate the gouernour. 3 Then when Iudas
which betraied him, sawe that hee was
condemned, hee repented himselfe, and
brought againe the thirtie pieces of siluer
to the chiefe Priestes, and Elders, 4 Saying,
I haue sinned, betraying the innocent
bloud. But they sayde, What is that to
vs? see thou to it. 5 And when hee
had cast downe the siluer pieces in the
Temple, hee departed, and went, and
hanged himselfe. 6 And the chiefe Priestes
tooke the siluer pieces, and sayde, It
is not lawfull for vs to put them into
the treasure, because it is the price of
bloud. 7 And they tooke counsell, and
bought with them a potters fielde, for
the buriall of strangers. 8 Wherefore
that field is called, The field of bloud,
9 (Then was fulfilled
vntill this day.
that which was spoken by Ieremias the
Prophet, saying, And they tooke thirtie
siluer pieces, ye price of him that was
valued, whom they of ye children of Israel
valued. 10 And they gaue them for the
potters fielde, as the Lord appointed me.)
11 And Iesus stood before ye gouernour,
and the gouernour asked him, saying, Art
thou that King of the Iewes? Iesus said
vnto him, Thou sayest it. 12 And when he
was accused of the chiefe Priestes, and
Elders, he answered nothing. 13 Then
saide Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou notMatthew 27:14
862
howe many things they lay against thee?
14 But he answered him not to one
worde, in so much that the gouernour
marueiled greatly. 15 Nowe at the feast,
the gouernour was wont to deliuer vnto
the people a prisoner whom they would.
16 And they had then a notable prisoner,
called Barabbas. 17 When they were then
gathered together, Pilate said vnto the,
Whether will ye that I let loose vnto you
Barabbas, or Iesus which is called Christ?
18 (For he knewe well, that for enuie
they had deliuered him. 19 Also when
he was set downe vpon the iudgement
seate, his wife sent to him, saying, Haue
thou nothing to do with that iust man:
for I haue suffered many things this day
in a dreame by reason of him.) 20 But
the chiefe Priestes and the Elders had
persuaded the people that they shoulde
aske Barabbas, and should destroy Iesus.
21 Then the gouernour answered, and said
vnto them, Whether of the twaine will
ye that I let loose vnto you? And they
said, Barabbas. 22 Pilate said vnto them,
What shall I do then with Iesus, which
is called Christ? They all said to him,
Let him be crucified. 23 Then saide the
gouernour, But what euill hath he done?
Then they cryed the more, saying, Let
him be crucified. 24 When Pilate saw that
he auailed nothing, but that more tumult
was made, he tooke water and washed
his hands before the multitude, saying, I
am innocent of the blood of this iust man:
looke you to it. 25 Then answered all the
people, and saide, His bloud be on vs, and
on our children. 26 Thus let he Barabbas
loose vnto them, and scourged Iesus, and
deliuered him to be crucified. 27 Then
the souldiers of the gouernour tooke Iesus
into the common hall, and gathered about
him the whole band, 28 And they stripped
him, and put about him a skarlet robe,
29 And platted a crowne of thornes, and
put it vpon his head, and a reede in his
right hand, and bowed their knees before
him, and mocked him, saying, God saue
thee King of the Iewes, 30 And spitted
vpon him, and tooke a reede, and smote
him on the head. 31 Thus when they
had mocked him, they tooke the robe
Matthew 27:50
from him, and put his owne rayment
on him, and led him away to crucifie
him. 32 And as they came out, they
found a man of Cyrene, named Simon:
him they compelled to beare his crosse.
33 And when they came vnto the place
called Golgotha, (that is to say, the place
of dead mens skulles) 34 They gaue him
vineger to drinke, mingled with gall: and
when he had tasted thereof, he would not
drinke. 35 And when they had crucified
him, they parted his garments, and did
cast lottes, that it might be fulfilled, which
was spoken by the Prophet, They deuided
my garments among them, and vpon my
vesture did cast lottes. 36 And they sate,
and watched him there. 37 They set vp
also ouer his head his cause written, THIS
IS IESVS THE KING OF THE IEVVES. 38 And
there were two theeues crucified with
him, one on the right hand, and another
on the left. 39 And they that passed by,
reuiled him, wagging their heades, 40 And
saying, Thou that destroyest ye Temple,
and buildest it in three dayes, saue thy
selfe: if thou be ye Sonne of God, come
downe from ye crosse. 41 Likewise also
the hie Priests mocking him, with the
Scribes, and Elders, and Pharises, said,
42 He saued others, but he cannot saue
him selfe: if he be ye King of Israel, let
him now come downe from ye crosse, and
we will beleeue in him. 43 He trusted in
God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will
haue him: for he saide, I am the Sonne
of God. 44 The selfe same thing also ye
theeues which were crucified with him,
cast in his teeth. 45 Now from ye sixt
houre was there darkenesse ouer all the
land, vnto the ninth houre. 46 And about
ye ninth houre Iesus cryed with a loud
voyce, saying, Eli, Eli, lamasabachthani?
that is, My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me? 47 And some of them that
stoode there, when they heard it, said,
This man calleth Elias. 48 And straightway
one of them ran, and tooke a spondge,
and filled it with vineger, and put it on
a reede, and gaue him to drinke. 49 Other
said, Let be: let vs see, if Elias wil come
and saue him. 50 Then Iesus cryed againeMatthew 27:51
863
with a loude voyce, and yeelded vp the
ghost. 51 And behold, the vayle of the Tem-
ple was rent in twaine, from the top to the
bottome, and the earth did quake, and the
stones were cloue. 52 And the graues did
open themselues, and many bodies of the
Saintes, which slept, arose, 53 And came
out of the graues after his resurrection,
and went into the holy citie, and appeared
vnto many. 54 When the Centurion, and
they that were with him watching Iesus,
saw the earthquake, and the thinges that
were done, they feared greatly, saying,
Truely this was the Sonne of God. 55 And
many women were there, beholding him
a farre off, which had folowed Iesus from
Galile, ministring vnto him. 56 Among
whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie
the mother of Iames, and Ioses, and the
mother of Zebedeus sonnes. 57 And when
the euen was come, there came a riche
man of Arimathea, named Ioseph, who
had also himselfe bene Iesus disciple.
58 He went to Pilate, and asked ye body of
Iesus. Then Pilate commanded ye body to
be deliuered. 59 So Ioseph tooke the body,
and wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth,
60 And put it in his new tombe, which he
had hewen out in a rocke, and rolled a
great stone to the doore of the sepulchre,
and departed. 61 And there was Marie
Magdalene, and the other Marie sitting
ouer against the sepulchre. 62 Nowe the
next day that followed the Preparation of
the Sabbath, the hie Priestes and Pharises
assembled to Pilate, 63 And said, Syr, we
remember that that deceiuer saide, while
he was yet aliue, Within three dayes I
will rise. 64 Command therefore, that the
sepulchre be made sure vntill the third
day, lest his disciples come by night, and
steale him away, and say vnto the people,
He is risen from the dead: so shall the last
errour be worse then the first. 65 Then
Pilate saide vnto them, Ye haue a watch:
goe, and make it sure as ye knowe. 66 And
they went, and made the sepulchre sure
with the watch, and sealed the stone.
Matthew 28:19
the first day of ye weeke began to dawne,
Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie
came to see the sepulchre, 2 And behold,
there was a great earthquake: for the An-
gel of the Lord descended from heauen,
and came and rolled backe the stone from
the doore, and sate vpon it. 3 And his
countenance was like lightning, and his
raiment white as snowe. 4 And for feare
of him, the keepers were astonied, and
became as dead men. 5 But the Angel an-
swered, and said to the women, Feare ye
not: for I know that ye seeke Iesus which
was crucified: 6 He is not here, for he is
risen; as he saide: come, see the place
where the Lord was laid, 7 And go quickly,
and tel his disciples that he is risen from
ye dead: and behold, he goeth before
you into Galile: there ye shall see him:
loe, I haue told you. 8 So they departed
quickly from the sepulchre, with feare
and great ioye, and did runne to bring his
disciples worde. 9 And as they wet to tel
his disciples, behold, Iesus also met the,
saying, God saue you. And they came, and
tooke him by the feete, and worshipped
him. 10 Then said Iesus vnto them, Be
not afraide. Goe, and tell my brethren,
that they goe into Galile, and there shall
they see me. 11 Nowe when they were
gone, beholde, some of the watch came
into the citie, and shewed vnto the hie
Priestes all ye things that were done.
12 And they gathered them together with
the Elders, and tooke counsell, and gaue
large money vnto the souldiers, 13 Saying,
Say, His disciples came by night, and stole
him away while we slept. 14 And if this
matter come before the gouernour to be
heard, we will perswade him, and so vse
the matter that you shall not neede to
care. 15 So they tooke the money, and
did as they were taught: and this saying
is noysed among the Iewes vnto this
day. 16 Then ye eleuen disciples wet into
Galile, into a mountaine, where Iesus had
appointed the. 17 And when they sawe
him, they worshipped him: but some
douted. 18 And Iesus came, and spake
vnto them, saying, All power is giuen
28
1 Now in the end of the Sabbath, when vnto me, in heauen, and in earth. 19 GoMatthew 28:20
864
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and the
Sonne, and the holy Ghost, 20 Teaching
them to obserue all things, whatsoeuer I
haue commanded you: and lo, I am with
you alway, vntill the ende of the worlde,
Amen.

THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO ST.
MARK
1 The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus
Christ, the Sonne of God: 2 As it is
written in the Prophets, Behold, I send my
messenger before thy face, which shall
prepare thy way before thee. 3 The voyce
of him that cryeth in the wildernesse
is, Prepare the way of the Lord: make
his paths straight. 4 Iohn did baptize in
the wildernesse, and preach the baptisme
of amendment of life, for remission of
sinnes. 5 And al ye countrey of Iudea,
and they of Hierusalem went out vnto
him, and were all baptized of him in
the riuer Iordan, confessing their sinnes.
6 Nowe Iohn was clothed with camels
heare, and with a girdle of a skinne about
his loynes: and he did eate Locusts and
wilde hony, 7 And preached, saying, A
stronger then I commeth after me, whose
shoes latchet I am not worthy to stoupe
downe, and vnloose. 8 Trueth it is, I
haue baptized you with water: but he will
baptize you with the holy Ghost. 9 And it
came to passe in those dayes, that Iesus
came from Nazareth, a citie of Galile,
and was baptized of Iohn in Iordan.
10 And assoone as he was come out of
the water, Iohn saw the heauens clouen
in twaine, and the holy Ghost descending
vpon him like a doue. 11 Then there was
a voyce from heauen, saying, Thou art
my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well
pleased. 12 And immediatly the Spirite
driueth him into the wildernesse. 13 And
he was there in the wildernesse fourtie
daies, and was tempted of Satan: hee
was also with the wilde beastes, and the
Angels ministred vnto him. 14 Now after
that Iohn was committed to prison, Iesus
came into Galile, preaching the Gospel
of the kingdome of God, 15 And saying,
The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of
God is at hand: repent and beleeue the
Gospel. 16 And as he walked by the sea
of Galile, he saw Simon, and Andrew his
Mark 1:34
brother, casting a net into the sea, (for
they were fishers.) 17 Then Iesus said vnto
them, Folow me, and I will make you to
be fishers of men. 18 And straightway
they forsooke their nets, and folowed
him. 19 And when hee had gone a litle
further thence, he sawe Iames the sonne
of Zebedeus, and Iohn his brother, as
they were in the ship, mending their nets.
20 And anon hee called them: and they
left their father Zebedeus in the shippe
with his hired seruants, and went their
way after him. 21 So they entred into Ca-
pernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath
day hee entred into the Synagogue, and
taught. 22 And they were astonied at his
doctrine, for he taught them as one that
had authoritie, and not as the Scribes.
23 And there was in their Synagogue a
man in whome was an vncleane spirite,
and hee cried out, 24 Saying, Ah, what
haue we to do with thee, O Iesus of
Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy vs? I
knowe thee what thou art, euen that holy
one of God. 25 And Iesus rebuked him,
saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of
him. 26 And the vncleane spirit tare him,
and cried with a loude voyce, and came
out of him. 27 And they were all amased,
so that they demaunded one of another,
saying, What thing is this? what newe
doctrine is this? for he commandeth euen
the foule spirites with authoritie, and they
obey him. 28 And immediatly his fame
spred abroade throughout all the region
bordering on Galile. 29 And assoone as
they were come out of the Synagogue,
they entred into the house of Symon and
Andrew, with Iames and Iohn. 30 And
Symons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer,
and anon they told him of her. 31 And
he came and tooke her by the hand, and
lifted her vp, and the feuer forsooke her
by and by, and shee ministred vnto them.
32 And whe euen was come, at what time
the sunne setteth, they brought to him
all that were diseased, and them that
were possessed with deuils. 33 And the
whole citie was gathered together at the
doore. 34 And he healed many that were
sicke of diuers diseases: and he cast outMark 1:35
866
many deuils, and suffred not the deuils
to say that they knewe him. 35 And in
the morning very early before day, Iesus
arose and went out into a solitarie place,
and there praied. 36 And Simon, and they
that were with him, followed carefully
after him. 37 And when they had found
him, they sayde vnto him, All men seeke
for thee. 38 Then he said vnto them, Let
vs go into the next townes, that I may
preach there also: for I came out for
that purpose. 39 And hee preached in
their Synagogues, throughout all Galile,
and cast the deuils out. 40 And there
came a leper to him, beseeching him, and
kneeled downe vnto him, and said to him,
If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.
41 And Iesus had compassion, and put
foorth his hand, and touched him, and
said to him, I wil: be thou cleane. 42 And
assone as he had spoken, immediatly ye
leprosie departed from him, and he was
made cleane. 43 And after he had giue
him a streight commandement, he sent
him away forthwith, 44 And sayde vnto
him, See thou say nothing to any man,
but get thee hence, and shewe thy selfe
to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing
those things, which Moses commanded,
for a testimoniall vnto them. 45 But when
he was departed, hee began to tel many
things, and to publish the matter: so that
Iesus could no more openly enter into the
citie, but was without in desert places:
and they came to him from euery quarter.
2
1 After a fewe dayes,
hee entred into
Capernaum againe, and it was noysed
that he was in the house. 2 And anon,
many gathered together, in so much that
the places about the doore coulde not
receiue any more and he preached the
word vnto them. 3 And there came vnto
him, that brought one sicke of the palsie,
borne of foure men. 4 And because they
could not come neere vnto him for the
multitude, they vncouered ye roofe of the
house where hee was: and when they
had broken it open, they let downe the
bed, wherein the sicke of the palsie lay.
Mark 2:19
5 Nowe when Iesus sawe their faith, he
saide to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne,
thy sinnes are forgiuen thee. 6 And there
were certaine of the Scribes sitting there,
and reasoning in their hearts, 7 Why
doeth this man speake such blasphemies?
who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely?
8 And immediatly when Iesus perceiued
in his spirite, that thus they reasoned with
themselues, he sayde vnto them, Why
reason yee these things in your hearts?
9 Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of
the palsie, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee?
or to say, Arise, and take vp thy bed, and
walke? 10 But that ye may knowe, that the
Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to
forgiue sinnes, (he sayde vnto the sicke
of the palsie.) 11 I say vnto thee, Arise
and take vp thy bed, and get thee hence
into thine owne house. 12 And by and
by he arose, and tooke vp his bed, and
went foorth before them all, in so much
that they were all amased, and glorified
God, saying, We neuer sawe such a thing.
13 Then he went foorth againe towarde
the sea, and all the people resorted vnto
him, and he taught them. 14 And as Iesus
passed by, hee sawe Leui the sonne of
Alpheus sit at the receit of custome, and
said vnto him, Folowe me. And he arose
and followed him. 15 And it came to passe,
as Iesus sate at table in his house, many
Publicanes and sinners sate at table also
with Iesus, and his disciples: for there
were many that followed him. 16 And
when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him
eate with the Publicanes and sinners, they
sayd vnto his disciples, Howe is it, that
hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes
and sinners? 17 Now when Iesus heard
it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole haue
no neede of the Physicion, but the sicke.
I came not to call the righteous, but
the sinners to repentance. 18 And the
disciples of Iohn, and the Pharises did
fast, and came and saide vnto him, Why
doe the disciples of Iohn, and of the
Pharises fast, and thy disciples fast not?
19 And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the
children of the marriage chamber fast,
whiles the bridegrome is with them? asMark 2:20
867
long as they haue the bridegrome with
them, they cannot fast. 20 But the daies
will come, when the bridegrome shall be
taken from them, and then shall they fast
in those daies. 21 Also no man soweth a
piece of newe cloth in an olde garment:
for els the newe piece that filled it vp,
taketh away somewhat from the olde, and
the breach is worse. 22 Likewise, no man
putteth newe wine into old vessels: for els
the new wine breaketh the vessels, and
the wine runneth out, and the vessels are
lost: but newe wine must be put into new
vessels. 23 And it came to passe as hee
went through the corne on the Sabbath
day, that his disciples, as they went on
their way, began to plucke the eares of
corne. 24 And the Pharises saide vnto him,
Beholde, why doe they on the Sabbath
day, that which is not lawfull? 25 And
he saide to them, Haue yee neuer read
what Dauid did when he had neede, and
was an hungred, both he, and they that
were with him? 26 Howe he went into the
house of God, in the daies of Abiathar the
hie Priest, and did eat the shewe bread,
which were not lawfull to eate, but for the
Priests, and gaue also to them which were
with him? 27 And hee sayde to them, The
Sabbath was made for man, and not man
for the Sabbath. 28 Wherefore the Sonne
of man is Lord, euen of the Sabbath.
3
1 And he entred againe into ye Syna-
gogue, and there was a man which had
a withered had. 2 And they watched
him, whether he would heale him on the
Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
3 Then he saide vnto the man which had
the withered hand, Arise: stand forth in
the middes. 4 And he saide to them, Is
it lawfull to doe a good deede on the
Sabbath day, or to doe euil? to saue
the life, or to kill? But they held their
peace. 5 Then hee looked rounde about
on them angerly, mourning also for the
hardnesse of their hearts, and saide to
the man, Stretch foorth thine hand. And
he stretched it out: and his hande was
restored, as whole as the other. 6 And
the Pharises departed, and straightway
Mark 3:24
gathered a councill with the Herodians
against him, that they might destroy him.
7 But Iesus auoided with his disciples to
the sea: and a great multitude followed
him from Galile, and from Iudea, 8 And
from Ierusalem, and from Idumea, and
beyonde Iordan: and they that dwelled
about Tyrus and Sidon, when they had
heard what great things he did, came
vnto him in great number. 9 And he
commanded his disciples, that a litle
shippe should waite for him, because of
the multitude, lest they shoulde throng
him. 10 For hee had healed many, in
so much that they preassed vpon him
to touch him, as many as had plagues.
11 And when the vncleane spirits sawe
him, they fel downe before him, and
cried, saying, Thou art the Sonne of
God. 12 And he sharply rebuked them,
to the ende they should not vtter him.
13 Then hee went vp into a mountaine,
and called vnto him whome he woulde,
and they came vnto him. 14 And hee
appoynted twelue that they should be
with him, and that he might send them
to preache, 15 And that they might haue
power to heale sicknesses, and to cast out
deuils. 16 And the first was Simon, and
hee named Simon, Peter, 17 Then Iames
the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iohn Iames
brother (and surnamed them Boanerges,
which is, the sonnes of thunder,) 18 And
Andrew, and Philippe, and Bartlemew,
and Matthewe, and Thomas, and Iames,
the sonne of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and
Simon the Cananite, 19 And Iudas Iscariot,
who also betraied him, and they came
home. 20 And the multitude assembled
againe, so that they could not so much as
eate bread. 21 And when his kinsfolkes
heard of it, they went out to laie hold on
him: for they sayde that he was beside
himselfe. 22 And the Scribes which came
downe from Hierusalem, saide, He hath
Beelzebub, and through the prince of the
deuils he casteth out deuils. 23 But he
called them vnto him, and said vnto them
in parables, How can Satan driue out
Satan? 24 For if a kingdome bee deuided
against it selfe, that kingdome can notMark 3:25
868
stand. 25 Or if a house bee deuided against
it selfe, that house can not continue.
26 So if Satan make insurrection against
himselfe, and be deuided, hee can not
endure but is at an ende. 27 No man
can enter into a strong mans house, and
take away his goods, except hee first
binde that strong man, and then spoyle
his house. 28 Verely I say vnto you, all
sinnes shalbe forgiuen vnto the children
of men, and blasphemies, wherewith they
blaspheme: 29 But hee that blasphemeth
against the holy Ghost, shall neuer haue
forgiuenesse, but is culpable of eternall
damnation. 30 Because they saide, Hee
had an vncleane spirit. 31 Then came his
brethren and mother, and stoode without,
and sent vnto him, and called him. 32 And
the people sate about him, and they said
vnto him, Beholde, thy mother, and thy
brethren seeke for thee without. 33 But
hee answered them, saying, Who is my
mother and my brethren? 34 And hee
looked rounde about on them, which
sate in compasse about him, and saide,
Beholde my mother and my brethren.
35 For whosoeuer doeth the will of God, he
is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
4
1 And hee began againe to teache by the
sea side, and there gathered vnto him a
great multitude, so that hee entred into
a shippe, and sate in the sea, and all
the people was by the sea side on the
land. 2 And he taught them many things
in parables, and said vnto them in his
doctrine, 3 Hearken: Beholde, there went
out a sower to sowe. 4 And it came to
passe as he sowed, that some fell by the
way side, and the foules of the heauen
came, and deuoured it vp. 5 And some fell
on stonie grounde, where it had not much
earth, and by and by sprang vp, because
it had not depth of earth. 6 But assoone
as ye Sunne was vp, it was burnt vp,
and because it had not roote, it withered
away. 7 And some fell among the thornes,
and the thornes grewe vp, and choked it,
so that it gaue no fruite. 8 Some againe
fell in good grounde, and did yeelde fruite
Mark 4:24
that sprong vp, and grewe, and it brought
foorth, some thirtie folde, some sixtie
folde, and some an hundreth folde. 9 Then
he said vnto them, He that hath eares
to heare, let him heare. 10 And whe
he was alone, they that were about him
with the twelue, asked him of ye parable.
11 And he saide vnto them, To you it
is giuen to knowe the mysterie of the
kingdome of God: but vnto them that are
without, all thinges bee done in parables,
12 That they seeing, may see, and not
discerne: and they hearing, may heare,
and not vnderstand, least at any time they
should turne, and their sinnes should
be forgiuen them. 13 Againe he said
vnto them, Perceiue ye not this parable?
howe then should ye vnderstand all other
parables? 14 The sower soweth the worde.
15 And these are they that receiue the
seede by the wayes side, in whome the
worde is sowen: but when they haue
heard it, Satan commeth immediatly, and
taketh away the worde that was sowen
in their heartes. 16 And likewise they
that receiue the seede in stony ground,
are they, which whe they haue heard
the word, straightwayes receiue it with
gladnesse. 17 Yet haue they no roote in
themselues, and endure but a time: for
when trouble and persecution ariseth for
the worde, immediatly they be offended.
18 Also they that receiue the seede among
the thornes, are such as heare the word:
19 But the cares of this world, and the
deceitfulnes of riches, and the lustes of
other things enter in, and choke the word,
and it is vnfruitfull. 20 But they that
haue receiued seede in good ground, are
they that heare the worde, and receiue it,
and bring foorth fruite: one corne thirtie,
another sixtie, and some an hundreth.
21 Also he saide vnto them, Commeth the
candle in, to be put vnder a bushell, or
vnder the bed, and not to be put on a
candlesticke? 22 For there is nothing hid,
that shall not be opened: neither is there
a secret, but that it shall come to light.
23 If any man haue eares to heare, let
him heare. 24 And he said vnto them,
Take heede what ye heare. With whatMark 4:25
869
measure ye mete, it shall be measured
vnto you: and vnto you that heare, shall
more be giuen. 25 For vnto him that
hath, shall it be giuen, and from him
that hath not, shall be taken away, euen
that he hath. 26 Also he said, So is the
kingdome of God, as if a man should
cast seede in the ground, 27 And shoulde
sleepe, and rise vp night and day, and
the seede should spring and growe vp,
he not knowing howe. 28 For the earth
bringeth foorth fruite of it selfe, first the
blade, then the eares, after that full corne
in the eares. 29 And assoone as the fruite
sheweth it selfe, anon hee putteth in the
sickle, because the haruest is come. 30 He
saide moreouer, Whereunto shall wee
liken the kingdome of God? or with what
comparison shall we compare it? 31 It is
like a graine of mustarde seede, which
when it is sowen in the earth, is the least
of all seedes that be in the earth: 32 But
after that it is sowen, it groweth vp, and
is greatest of all herbes, and beareth great
branches, so that the foules of heauen
may builde vnder the shadow of it. 33 And
with many such parables he preached
the word vnto them, as they were able
to heare it. 34 And without parables
spake hee nothing vnto them: but he
expounded all thinges to his disciples
apart. 35 Nowe the same day when euen
was come, he saide vnto them, Let vs
passe ouer vnto the other side. 36 And
they left the multitude, and tooke him as
he was in the shippe, and there were also
with him other little shippes. 37 And there
arose a great storme of winde, and the
waues dashed into the shippe, so that it
was now full. 38 And he was in the sterne
asleepe on a pillow: and they awoke him,
and saide to him, Master, carest thou
not that we perish? 39 And hee rose
vp, and rebuked the winde, and saide
vnto the sea, Peace, and be still. So the
winde ceased, and it was a great calme.
40 Then he saide vnto them, Why are ye so
fearefull? how is it that ye haue no faith?
41 And they feared exceedingly, and said
one to another, Who is this, that both the
winde and sea obey him?
Mark 5:18
5
1 And
they came ouer to the other
side of the sea into the countrey of the
Gadarens. 2 And when he was come out
of the shippe, there met him incontinently
out of the graues, a man which had an
vncleane spirit: 3 Who had his abiding
among the graues, and no man could
binde him, no not with chaines: 4 Because
that when hee was often bounde with fet-
ters and chaines, he plucked the chaines
asunder, and brake the fetters in pieces,
neither could any man tame him. 5 And
alwayes both night and day he cryed in
the mountaines, and in the graues, and
strooke himselfe with stones. 6 And when
he saw Iesus afarre off, he ranne, and
worshipped him, 7 And cryed with a loude
voyce, and saide, What haue I to doe with
thee, Iesus the Sonne of the most high
God? I will that thou sweare to me by
God, that thou torment me not. 8 (For
hee saide vnto him, Come out of the man,
thou vncleane spirit.) 9 And he asked him,
What is thy name? and hee answered,
saying, My name is Legion: for we are
many. 10 And hee prayed him instantly,
that hee would not send them away out
of the countrey. 11 Now there was there
in the mountaines a great heard of swine,
feeding. 12 And all ye deuils besought him,
saying, Send vs into the swine, that we
may enter into them. 13 And incontinently
Iesus gaue them leaue. Then the vncleane
spirites went out, and entred into the
swine, and the heard ranne headlong
from the high banke into the sea, (and
there were about two thousand swine)
and they were choked vp in the sea.
14 And the swineheards fled, and told it
in the citie, and in the countrey, and they
came out to see what it was that was done.
15 And they came to Iesus, and sawe him
that had bene possessed with the deuil,
and had the legion, sit both clothed, and
in his right minde: and they were afraide.
16 And they that saw it, tolde them, what
was done to him that was possessed
with the deuil, and concerning the swine.
17 Then they began to pray him, that hee
would depart from their coastes. 18 AndMark 5:19
when he was come into the shippe, he
that had bene possessed with the deuil,
prayed him that he might be with him.
19 Howbeit, Iesus would not suffer him,
but said vnto him, Goe thy way home to
thy friendes, and shewe them what great
thinges the Lord hath done vnto thee,
and howe hee hath had compassion on
thee. 20 So he departed, and began to
publish in Decapolis, what great things
Iesus had done vnto him: and all men did
marueile. 21 And when Iesus was come
ouer againe by ship vnto the other side, a
great multitude gathered together to him,
and he was neere vnto the sea. 22 And
beholde, there came one of the rulers of
the Synagogue, whose name was Iairus:
and when he sawe him, he fell downe at
his feete, 23 And besought him instantly,
saying, My litle daughter lyeth at point
of death: I pray thee that thou wouldest
come and lay thine hands on her, that she
may be healed, and liue. 24 Then hee went
with him, and a great multitude folowed
him, and thronged him. 25 (And there was
a certaine woman, which was diseased
with an issue of blood twelue yeeres,
26 And had suffred many things of many
physicions, and had spent all that she
had, and it auailed her nothing, but she
became much worse. 27 When she had
heard of Iesus, shee came in the preasse
behinde, and touched his garment. 28 For
she said, If I may but touch his clothes,
I shalbe whole. 29 And straightway the
course of her blood was dried vp, and
she felt in her body, that she was healed
of that plague. 30 And immediatly when
Iesus did knowe in himselfe the vertue
that went out of him, he turned him
round about in the preasse, and said,
Who hath touched my clothes? 31 And
his disciples said vnto him, Thou seest the
multitude throng thee, and sayest thou,
Who did touche me? 32 And he looked
round about, to see her that had done
that. 33 And the woman feared and trem-
bled: for she knewe what was done in
her, and shee came and fell downe before
him, and tolde him the whole trueth.
34 And hee saide to her, Daughter, thy
faith hath made thee whole: go in peace,
870
Mark 6:5
and be whole of thy plague.) 35 While hee
yet spake, there came from the same ruler
of the Synagogues house certaine which
said, Thy daughter is dead: why diseasest
thou the Master any further? 36 Assoone
as Iesus heard that word spoken, he said
vnto the ruler of the Synagogue, Be not
afraide: onely beleeue. 37 And he suffered
no man to follow him saue Peter and
Iames, and Iohn the brother of Iames.
38 So hee came vnto the house of the ruler
of the Synagogue, and sawe the tumult,
and them that wept and wailed greatly.
39 And he went in, and said vnto them,
Why make ye this trouble, and weepe?
the childe is not dead, but sleepeth. 40 And
they laught him to scorne: but hee put
them all out, and tooke the father, and
the mother of the childe, and them that
were with him, and entred in where the
childe lay, 41 And tooke the childe by the
hand, and saide vnto her, Talitha cumi,
which is by interpretation, Mayden, I say
vnto thee, arise. 42 And straightway the
mayden arose, and walked: for shee was
of the age of twelue yeeres, and they
were astonied out of measure. 43 And he
charged them straitly that no man should
knowe of it, and commanded to giue her
meate.
1 And
6
he departed thence, and came
into his owne countrey, and his disciples
followed him. 2 And when the Sabbath
was come, he began to teach in the
Synagogue, and many that heard him,
were astonied, and sayd, From whence
hath this man these things? and what
wisdome is this that is giuen vnto him,
that euen such great workes are done by
his hands? 3 Is not this that carpenter
Maries sonne, the brother of Iames and
Ioses, and of Iuda and Simon? and are
not his sisters here with vs? And they
4 Then Iesus
were offended in him.
sayd vnto them, A Prophet is not without
honour, but in his owne countrey, and
among his owne kindred, and in his own
house. 5 And he could there doe no
great workes, saue that hee layd his hands
vpon a fewe sicke folke, and healed them,Mark 6:6
871
6 And he marueiled at their vnbeliefe, and
went about by ye townes on euery side,
teaching. 7 And he called vnto him the
twelue, and began to send them forth
two and two, and gaue them power ouer
vncleane spirits, 8 And commanded them
that they should take nothing for their
iourney, saue a staffe onely: neither scrip,
neither bread, neither money in their
girdles: 9 But that they should be shod
with sandals, and that they should not put
on two coates. 10 And he sayd vnto them,
Wheresoeuer ye shall enter into an house,
there abide till ye depart thence. 11 And
whosoeuer shall not receiue you, nor
heare you, when ye depart thence, shake
off the dust that is vnder your feete, for a
witnes vnto them. Verely I say vnto you, It
shalbe easier for Sodom, or Gomorrha at
the day of iudgement, then for that citie.
12 And they went out, and preached, that
men should amend their liues. 13 And
they cast out many deuils: and they
anointed many that were sicke, with oyle,
and healed them. 14 Then King Herod
heard of him (for his name was made
manifest) and sayd, Iohn Baptist is risen
againe from the dead, and therefore great
workes are wrought by him. 15 Other
sayd, It is Elias, and some sayd, It is a
Prophet, or as one of those Prophets. 16 So
when Herod heard it, he said, It is Iohn
whom I beheaded: he is risen from the
dead. 17 For Herod him selfe had sent
forth, and had taken Iohn, and bound
him in prison for Herodias sake, which
was his brother Philippes wife, because
he had maried her. 18 For Iohn sayd vnto
Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to haue
thy brothers wife. 19 Therefore Herodias
layd waite against him, and would haue
killed him, but she could not: 20 For Herod
feared Iohn, knowing that hee was a iust
man, and an holy, and reuerenced him,
and when he heard him, he did many
things, and heard him gladly. 21 But
the time being conuenient, when Herod
on his birth day made a banket to his
princes and captaines, and chiefe estates
of Galile: 22 And the daughter of the
same Herodias came in, and daunced,
Mark 6:37
and pleased Herod, and them that sate
at table together, the King sayd vnto the
mayde, Aske of me what thou wilt, and
I will giue it thee. 23 And he sware vnto
her, Whatsoeuer thou shalt aske of me, I
will giue it thee, euen vnto the halfe of my
kingdome. 24 So she went forth, and said
to her mother, What shall I aske? And
she said, Iohn Baptists head. 25 Then she
came in straightway with haste vnto the
King, and asked, saying, I would that thou
shouldest giue me euen now in a charger
the head of Iohn Baptist. 26 Then the King
was very sory: yet for his othes sake, and
for their sakes which sate at table with
him, he would not refuse her. 27 And
immediatly the King sent the hangman,
and gaue charge that his head shoulde
be brought in. So he went and beheaded
him in the prison, 28 And brought his head
in a charger, and gaue it to the maide,
and the maide gaue it to her mother.
29 And when his disciples heard it, they
came and tooke vp his body, and put it
in a tombe. 30 And the Apostles gathered
themselues together to Iesus, and tolde
him all things, both what they had done,
and what they had taught. 31 And he
sayd vnto them, Come ye apart into the
wildernes, and rest a while: for there
were many commers and goers, that they
had not leasure to eate. 32 So they went
by ship out of the way into a desart place.
33 But the people sawe them when they
departed, and many knewe him, and ran
a foote thither out of all cities, and came
thither before them, and assembled vnto
him. 34 Then Iesus went out, and sawe
a great multitude, and had compassion
on them, because they were like sheepe
which had no shepheard: and he began to
teach them many things. 35 And when the
day was nowe farre spent, his disciples
came vnto him, saying, This is a desart
place, and nowe the day is farre passed.
36 Let them depart, that they may goe into
the countrey and townes about, and buy
them bread: for they haue nothing to
eate. 37 But he answered, and said vnto
them, Giue yee them to eate. And they
said vnto him, Shall we goe, and buy twoMark 6:38
872
hundreth peny worth of bread, and giue
them to eate? 38 Then he sayde vnto them,
Howe many loaues haue ye? goe and
looke. And when they knewe it, they sayd,
Fiue, and two fishes. 39 So he commanded
them to make them all sit downe by com-
panies vpon the greene grasse. 40 Then
they sate downe by rowes, by hundreds,
and by fifties. 41 And he tooke the fiue
loaues, and the two fishes, and looked vp
to heauen, and gaue thanks, and brake
the loaues, and gaue them to his disciples
to set before them, and the two fishes
he deuided among them all. 42 So they
did all eate, and were satisfied. 43 And
they tooke vp twelue baskets full of the
fragments, and of the fishes. 44 And they
that had eaten, were about fiue thousand
men. 45 And straightway he caused his
disciples to goe into the ship, and to goe
before vnto the other side vnto Bethsaida,
while he sent away the people. 46 Then
assoone as he had sent them away, he
departed into a mountaine to pray. 47 And
when euen was come, the ship was in
the mids of the sea, and he alone on the
land. 48 And he saw them troubled in
rowing, (for the winde was contrary vnto
them) and about the fourth watch of the
night, hee came vnto them, walking vpon
the sea, and would haue passed by them.
49 And when they saw him walking vpon
the sea, they supposed it had bene a spirit,
and cried out. 50 For they all saw him, and
were sore afrayd: but anon he talked with
them, and said vnto them, Be ye of good
comfort: it is I, be not afrayd. 51 Then he
went vp vnto them into the ship, and the
winde ceased, and they were much more
amased in them selues, and marueiled.
52 For they had not considered the matter
of the loaues, because their hearts were
hardened. 53 And they came ouer, and
went into the land of Gennesaret, and
arriued. 54 So when they were come
out of the ship, straightway they knewe
him, 55 And ran about throughout all that
region round about, and began to cary
hither and thither in couches all that
were sicke, where they heard that he
was. 56 And whithersoeuer he entred into
Mark 7:14
townes, or cities, or villages, they laide
their sicke in the streetes, and prayed him
that they might touch at the least the edge
of his garment. And as many as touched
him, were made whole.
7
1 Then gathered vnto him the Pharises,
and certaine of the Scribes which came
2 And when they
from Hierusalem.
sawe some of his disciples eate meate
with common hands, (that is to say,
vnwashen) they complained. 3 (For the
Pharises, and all the Iewes, except they
wash their hands oft, eate not, holding
the tradition of the Elders. 4 And when
they come from the market, except they
wash, they eate not: and many other
things there be, which they haue taken
vpon them to obserue, as the washing
of cups, and pots, and of brasen vessels,
and of beds.) 5 Then asked him the
Pharises and Scribes, Why walke not thy
disciples according to the tradition of the
Elders, but eate meate with vnwashen
hands? 6 Then hee answered and sayd
vnto them, Surely Esay hath prophecied
well of you, hypocrites, as it is written,
This people honoureth mee with lippes,
but their heart is farre away from me.
7 But they worship me in vaine, teach-
ing for doctrines the commandements of
men. 8 For ye lay the commandement
of God apart, and obserue the tradition
of men, as the washing of pots and of
cups, and many other such like things ye
doe. 9 And he sayd vnto them, Well, ye
reiect the commandement of God, that ye
may obserue your owne tradition. 10 For
Moses sayd, Honour thy father and thy
mother: and Whosoeuer shall speake
euill of father or mother, let him die the
death. 11 But yee say, If a man say to
father or mother, Corban, that is, By the
gift that is offered by mee, thou mayest
haue profite, hee shall be free. 12 So ye
suffer him no more to doe any thing for
his father, or his mother, 13 Making the
worde of God of none authoritie, by your
tradition which ye haue ordeined: and
ye doe many such like things. 14 ThenMark 7:15
873
he called the whole multitude vnto him,
and sayd vnto them, Hearken you all vnto
me, and vnderstand. 15 There is nothing
without a man, that can defile him, when
it entreth into him: but the things which
proceede out of him, are they which defile
the man. 16 If any haue eares to heare,
let him heare. 17 And when hee came
into an house, away from the people,
his disciples asked him concerning the
parable. 18 And he sayde vnto them,
What? are ye without vnderstanding
also? Doe ye not knowe that whatsoeuer
thing from without entreth into a man,
cannot defile him, 19 Because it entreth
not into his heart, but into the belly, and
goeth out into the draught which is the
purging of all meates? 20 Then he sayd,
That which commeth out of man, that
defileth man. 21 For from within, euen
out of the heart of men, proceede euill
thoughtes, adulteries, fornications, mur-
thers, 22 Theftes, couetousnes, wickednes,
deceite, vncleannes, a wicked eye, back-
biting, pride, foolishnesse. 23 All these
euill things come from within, and defile
a man. 24 And from thence he rose, and
went into the borders of Tyrus and Sidon,
and entred into an house, and woulde
that no man should haue knowen: but he
could not be hid. 25 For a certaine woman,
whose litle daughter had an vncleane
spirit, heard of him, and came, and fell
at his feete, 26 (And the woman was a
Greeke, a Syrophenissian by nation) and
she besought him that he would cast out
the deuill out of her daughter. 27 But
Iesus saide vnto her, Let the children
first be fedde: for it is not good to take
the childrens bread, and to cast it vnto
whelpes. 28 Then shee answered, and
saide vnto him, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede
the whelpes eate vnder the table of the
childrens crommes. 29 Then he said vnto
her, For this saying goe thy way: the
deuil is gone out of thy daughter. 30 And
when shee was come home to her house,
shee founde the deuill departed, and her
daughter lying on the bed. 31 And hee
departed againe from the coastes of Tyrus
and Sidon, and came vnto the sea of
Galile, through the middes of the coastes
Mark 8:11
of Decapolis. 32 And they brought vnto
him one that was deafe and stambered
in his speache, and prayed him to put
his hand vpon him. 33 Then hee tooke
him aside from the multitude, and put
his fingers in his eares, and did spit, and
touched his tongue. 34 And looking vp to
heauen, hee sighed, and said vnto him,
Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 35 And
straightway his eares were opened, and
the string of his tongue was loosed, and
hee spake plaine. 36 And he commanded
them, that they should tell no man: but
howe much soeuer hee forbad them, the
more a great deale they published it,
37 And were beyonde measure astonied,
saying, Hee hath done all thinges well: he
maketh both the deafe to heare, and the
domme to speake.
1 In
8
those dayes, when there was a
very great multitude, and had nothing to
eate, Iesus called his disciples to him, and
said vnto them, 2 I haue compassion on
the multitude, because they haue nowe
continued with mee three dayes, and
haue nothing to eate. 3 And if I sende
them away fasting to their owne houses,
they woulde faint by the way: for some
of them came from farre. 4 Then his
disciples answered him, Whence can a
man satisfie these with bread here in the
wildernes? 5 And hee asked them, Howe
many loaues haue ye? And they said,
Seuen. 6 Then he commanded the multi-
tude to sit downe on the grounde: and hee
tooke the seuen loaues, and gaue thankes,
brake them, and gaue to his disciples to
set before them, and they did set them
before the people. 7 They had also a
few small fishes: and when he had giuen
thankes, he commanded them also to be
set before them. 8 So they did eate, and
were sufficed, and they tooke vp of the
broken meate that was left, seuen baskets
full. 9 (And they that had eaten, were
about foure thousand) so he sent them
away. 10 And anon he entred into a ship
with his disciples, and came into the parts
of Dalmanutha. 11 And the Pharises cameMark 8:12
foorth, and began to dispute with him,
seeking of him a signe from heauen, and
tempting him. 12 Then hee sighed deepely
in his spirit, and saide, Why doeth this
generation seeke a signe? Verely I say
vnto you, a signe shall not be giuen vnto
this generation. 13 So he left them, and
went into the ship againe, and departed to
the other side. 14 And they had forgotten
to take bread, neither had they in the
shippe with them, but one loafe. 15 And
he charged them, saying, Take heede, and
beware of the leauen of the Pharises,
and of the leauen of Herod. 16 And they
reasoned among themselues, saying, It
is, because we haue no bread. 17 And
when Iesus knew it, he said vnto them,
Why reason you thus, because ye haue
no bread? perceiue ye not yet, neither
vnderstande? haue ye your hearts yet
hardened? 18 Haue yee eyes, and see not?
and haue yee eares, and heare not? and
doe ye not remember? 19 When I brake
the fiue loaues among fiue thousand, how
many baskets full of broken meate tooke
ye vp? They said vnto him, Twelue.
20 And when I brake seuen among foure
thousande, howe many baskets of the
leauings of broken meate tooke ye vp?
And they said, Seuen. 21 Then he saide
vnto them, Howe is it that ye vnderstand
not? 22 And hee came to Bethsaida, and
they brought a blinde man vnto him, and
desired him to touch him. 23 Then he
tooke the blinde by the hand, and ledde
him out of the towne, and spat in his
eyes, and put his handes vpon him, and
asked him, if he sawe ought. 24 And he
looked vp, and said, I see men: for I see
them walking like trees. 25 After that,
he put his hands againe vpon his eyes,
and made him looke againe. And hee
was restored to his sight, and sawe euery
man a farre off clearely. 26 And hee sent
him home to his house, saying, Neither
goe into the towne, nor tell it to any in
the towne. 27 And Iesus went out, and
his disciples into the townes of Cesarea
Philippi. And by the way hee asked his
disciples, saying vnto them, Whome doe
men say that I am? 28 And they answered,
874
Mark 9:4
Some say, Iohn Baptist: and some, Elias:
and some, one of the Prophets. 29 And he
said vnto them, But whome say ye that
I am? Then Peter answered, and saide
vnto him, Thou art that Christ. 30 And he
sharpely charged them, that concerning
him they should tell no man. 31 Then
hee began to teache them that the Sonne
of man must suffer many things, and
should be reproued of the Elders, and
of the hie Priestes, and of the Scribes,
and be slaine, and within three dayes rise
againe. 32 And he spake that thing boldly.
Then Peter tooke him aside, and began
to rebuke him. 33 Then he turned backe,
and looked on his disciples, and rebuked
Peter, saying, Get thee behinde me, Satan:
for thou vnderstandest not the things that
are of God, but the things that are of
men. 34 And hee called the people vnto
him with his disciples, and saide vnto
them, Whosoeuer will follow me, let him
forsake himselfe, and take vp his crosse,
and follow me. 35 For whosoeuer will
saue his life, shall lose it: but whosoeuer
shall lose his life for my sake and the
Gospels, he shall saue it. 36 For what shall
it profite a man, though he should winne
the whole world, if he lose his soule? 37 Or
what exchange shall a man giue for his
soule? 38 For whosoeuer shall be ashamed
of mee, and of my wordes among this
adulterous and sinfull generation, of him
shall the Sonne of man be ashamed also,
when he commeth in the glorie of his
Father with the holy Angels.
9
1 And he saide vnto them, Verely I say
vnto you, that there be some of them
that stande here, which shall not taste of
death till they haue seene the kingdome
of God come with power. 2 And sixe
dayes after, Iesus taketh vnto him Peter,
and Iames, and Iohn, and carieth them
vp into an hie mountaine out of the
way alone, and his shape was changed
before them. 3 And his rayment did shine,
and was very white, as snowe, so white
as no fuller can make vpon the earth.
4 And there appeared vnto them EliasMark 9:5
875
with Moses, and they were talking with
Iesus. 5 Then Peter answered, and said
to Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be
here: let vs make also three tabernacles,
one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
for Elias. 6 Yet hee knewe not what he
saide: for they were afraide. 7 And there
was a cloude that shadowed them, and a
voyce came out of the cloude, saying, This
is my beloued Sonne: heare him. 8 And
suddenly they looked roud about, and
sawe no more any man saue Iesus only
with them. 9 And as they came downe
from the mountaine, he charged them,
that they should tell no man what they
had seene, saue when the Sonne of man
were risen from the dead againe. 10 So
they kept that matter to themselues, and
demaunded one of another, what the ris-
ing from the dead againe should meane?
11 Also they asked him, saying, Why say
the Scribes, that Elias must first come?
12 And he answered, and said vnto them,
Elias verely shall first come, and restore
all things: and as it is written of the Sonne
of man, hee must suffer many things, and
be set at nought. 13 But I say vnto you,
that Elias is come, (and they haue done
vnto him whatsoeuer they would) as it
is written of him. 14 And when he came
to his disciples, he saw a great multitude
about them, and the Scribes disputing
with them. 15 And straightway all the
people, when they behelde him, were
amased, and ranne to him, and saluted
him. 16 Then hee asked the Scribes, What
dispute you among your selues? 17 And
one of the companie answered, and said,
Master, I haue brought my sonne vnto
thee, which hath a dumme spirit: 18 And
wheresoeuer he taketh him, he teareth
him, and he fometh, and gnasheth his
teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy
disciples, that they should cast him out,
and they could not. 19 Then he answered
him, and said, O faithlesse generation,
how long now shall I be with you! how
long now shall I suffer you! Bring him
vnto me. 20 So they brought him vnto
him: and assoone as the spirit sawe him,
hee tare him, and hee fell downe on the
Mark 9:37
ground walowing and foming. 21 Then
he asked his father, How long time is it
since he hath bin thus? And he said,
Of a childe. 22 And oft times he casteth
him into the fire, and into the water to
destroy him: but if thou canst do any
thing, helpe vs, and haue compassion
vpon vs. 23 And Iesus said vnto him,
If thou canst beleeue it, al things are
possible to him that beleeueth. 24 And
straightway the father of the childe crying
with teares, saide, Lord, I beleeue: helpe
my vnbeliefe. 25 When Iesus saw that
the people came running together, he
rebuked the vncleane spirit, saying vnto
him, Thou domme and deafe spirit, I
charge thee, come out of him, and enter
no more into him. 26 Then the spirit
cried, and rent him sore, and came out,
and he was as one dead, in so much
that many said, He is dead. 27 But Iesus
tooke his hande, and lift him vp, and
he arose. 28 And when hee was come
into the house, his disciples asked him
secretly, Why could not we cast him out?
29 And he saide vnto them, This kinde can
by no other meanes come foorth, but by
prayer and fasting. 30 And they departed
thence, and went together through Galile,
and hee would not that any should haue
knowen it. 31 For he taught his disciples,
and saide vnto them, The Sonne of man
shalbe deliuered into the handes of men,
and they shall kill him, but after that he is
killed, he shall rise againe the third day.
32 But they vnderstoode not that saying,
and were afraide to aske him. 33 After, he
came to Capernaum: and when he was
in the house, he asked them, What was it
that ye disputed among you by the way?
34 And they helde their peace: for by the
way they reasoned among themselues,
who should bee the chiefest. 35 And he
sate downe, and called the twelue, and
said to them, If any man desire to be first,
the same shalbe last of all, and seruant
vnto all. 36 And he tooke a litle childe, and
set him in the middes of them, and tooke
him in his armes, and sayd vnto them,
37 Whosoeuer shall receiue one of such
litle children in my Name, receiueth me:
and whosoeuer receiueth mee, receiuethMark 9:38
876
not me, but him that sent me. 38 Then
Iohn answered him, saying, Master, we
sawe one casting out deuils by thy Name,
which followeth not vs, and we forbade
him, because he followeth vs not. 39 But
Iesus sayd, Forbid him not: for there is
no man that can doe a miracle by my
Name, that can lightly speake euill of
me. 40 For whosoeuer is not against vs,
is on our part. 41 And whosoeuer shall
giue you a cup of water to drinke for
my Names sake, because ye belong to
Christ, verely I say vnto you, he shall not
lose his rewarde. 42 And whosoeuer shall
offend one of these litle ones, that beleeue
in me, it were better for him rather,
that a milstone were hanged about his
necke, and that he were cast into the sea.
43 Wherefore, if thine hand cause thee
to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee
to enter into life, maimed, then hauing
two hands, to goe into hell, into the fire
that neuer shalbe quenched, 44 Where
their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer
goeth out. 45 Likewise, if thy foote cause
thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for
thee to go halt into life, then hauing two
feete, to be cast into hell, into the fire
that neuer shalbe quenched, 46 Where
their worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer
goeth out. 47 And if thine eye cause thee
to offende, plucke it out: it is better for
thee to goe into the kingdome of God
with one eye, then hauing two eyes, to be
cast into hell fire, 48 Where their worme
dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out.
49 For euery man shalbe salted with fire:
and euery sacrifice shalbe salted with salt.
50 Salt is good: but if the salt be vnsauerie,
wherewith shall it be seasoned? haue salt
in your selues, and haue peace one with
another.

1 And he arose from thence, and went
into the coastes of Iudea by the farre side
of Iordan, and the people resorted vnto
him againe, and as he was wont, he taught
them againe. 2 Then the Pharises came
and asked him, if it were lawfull for a
man to put away his wife, and tempted
him. 3 And he answered, and sayde vnto
Mark 10:21
them, What did Moses commaund you?
4 And they sayd, Moses suffered to write a
bill of diuorcement, and to put her away.
5 Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto
them, For the hardnesse of your heart he
wrote this precept vnto you. 6 But at the
beginning of the creation God made them
male and female: 7 For this cause shall
man leaue his father and mother, and
cleaue vnto his wife. 8 And they twaine
shalbe one flesh: so that they are no more
twaine, but one flesh. 9 Therefore, what
God hath coupled together, let not man
separate. 10 And in the house his disciples
asked him againe of that matter. 11 And
he sayd vnto them, Whosoeuer shall put
away his wife and marrie another, com-
mitteth adulterie against her. 12 And if
a woman put away her husband, and
be married to another, she committeth

children to him, that he should touch
them, and his disciples rebuked those
that brought them. 14 But when Iesus
sawe it, he was displeased, and said to
them, Suffer the litle children to come
vnto me, and forbid them not: for of such
is the kingdome of God. 15 Verely I say
vnto you, Whosoeuer shall not receiue the
kingdome of God as a litle childe, he shall
not enter therein. 16 And he tooke them
vp in his armes, and put his hands vpon
them, and blessed them. 17 And when
hee was gone out on the way, there came
one running, and kneeled to him, and
asked him, Good Master, what shall I doe,
that I may possesse eternall life? 18 Iesus
sayde to him, Why callest thou me good?
there is none good but one, euen God.
19 Thou knowest the comandements, Thou
shalt not commit adulterie. Thou shalt
not kill. Thou shalt not steale. Thou shalt
not beare false witnesse. Thou shalt hurt
no man. Honour thy father and mother.
20 Then he answered, and said to him,
Master, all these things I haue obserued
from my youth. 21 And Iesus looked vpon
him, and loued him, and sayde vnto him,
One thing is lacking vnto thee. Go and
sell all that thou hast, and giue to the
poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in
heauen, and come, follow me, and takeMark 10:22
877
vp the crosse. 22 But hee was sad at
that saying, and went away sorowfull: for
he had great possessions. 23 And Iesus
looked round about, and sayd vnto his
disciples, Howe hardly doe they that haue
riches, enter into the kingdome of God!
24 And his disciples were afraide at his
words. But Iesus answered againe, and
sayd vnto them, Children, how hard is it
for them that trust in riches, to enter into
the kingdome of God! 25 It is easier for a
camel to goe through the eye of a needle,
then for a riche man to enter into the
kingdome of God. 26 And they were much
more astonied, saying with themselues,
Who then can be saued? 27 But Iesus
looked vpon them, and sayd, With men
it is impossible, but not with God: for
with God all things are possible. 28 Then
Peter began to say vnto him, Loe, we
haue forsaken all, and haue folowed thee.
29 Iesus answered, and sayd, Verely I
say vnto you, there is no man that hath
forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or
father, or mother, or wife, or children,
or lands for my sake and the Gospels,
30 But he shall receiue an hundred folde,
now at this present, houses, and brethren,
and sisters, and mothers, and children,
and lands with persecutions, and in the
world to come, eternall life. 31 But many
that are first, shall be last, and the last,
first. 32 And they were in the way going
vp to Hierusalem, and Iesus went before
them and they were troubled, and as they
followed, they were afraide, and Iesus
tooke the twelue againe, and began to
tell them what things should come vnto
him, 33 Saying, Beholde, we goe vp to
Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall
be deliuered vnto the hie Priests, and
to the Scribes, and they shall condemne
him to death, and shall deliuer him to
the Gentiles. 34 And they shall mocke
him, and scourge him, and spit vpon
him, and kill him: but the third day
he shall rise againe. 35 Then Iames and
Iohn the sonnes of Zebedeus came vnto
him, saying, Master, we would that thou
shouldest doe for vs that we desire. 36 And
he sayd vnto them, What would ye I
Mark 10:52
should doe for you? 37 And they said
to him, Graunt vnto vs, that we may sit,
one at thy right hand, and the other at
thy left hand in thy glory. 38 But Iesus
sayd vnto them, Ye knowe not what ye
aske. Can ye drinke of the cup that I
shall drinke of, and be baptized with the
baptisme that I shall be baptized with?
39 And they said vnto him, We can. But
Iesus sayd vnto them, Ye shall drinke in
deede of the cup that I shall drinke of, and
be baptized with the baptisme wherewith
I shalbe baptized: 40 But to sit at my right
hand, and at my left, is not mine to giue,
but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is
prepared. 41 And when the ten heard that,
they began to disdaine at Iames and Iohn.
42 But Iesus called them vnto him, and
sayd to them, Ye know that they which
are princes among the Gentiles, haue
domination ouer them, and they that be
great among them, exercise authoritie
ouer them. 43 But it shall not be so
among you: but whosoeuer will be great
among you, shall be your seruant. 44 And
whosoeuer will be chiefe of you, shall
be the seruant of all. 45 For euen the
Sonne of man came not to be serued,
but to serue, and to giue his life for the
raunsome of many. 46 Then they came
to Iericho: and as he went out of Iericho
with his disciples, and a great multitude,
Bartimeus the sonne of Timeus, a blinde
man, sate by the wayes side, begging.
47 And when hee heard that it was Iesus
of Nazareth, he began to crye, and to say,
Iesus the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on
me. 48 And many rebuked him, because
he should holde his peace: but hee cryed
much more, O Sonne of Dauid, haue
mercy on me. 49 Then Iesus stood still,
and commanded him to be called: and
they called the blind, saying vnto him, Be
of good comfort: arise, he calleth thee.
50 So he threwe away his cloke, and rose,
and came to Iesus. 51 And Iesus answered,
and said vnto him, What wilt thou that
I doe vnto thee? And the blinde sayd
vnto him, Lord, that I may receiue sight.
52 Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Goe thy
way: thy fayth hath saued thee. And byMark 11:1

answered, and said vnto them, Neither

1 And
12
he began to speake vnto them
in parables, A certaine man planted a
vineyard, and copassed it with an hedge,
and digged a pit for the winepresse, and
built a tower in it, and let it out to
husbandmen, and went into a strange
countrey. 2 And at the time, he sent
to the husbandmen a seruant, that he
might receiue of the husbandmen of the
fruite of the vineyard. 3 But they tooke
him, and beat him, and sent him away
emptie. 4 And againe he sent vnto them
another seruant, and at him they cast
stones, and brake his head, and sent him
away shamefully handled. 5 And againe
he sent another, and him they slew, and
many other, beating some, and killing
some. 6 Yet had he one sonne, his deare
beloued: him also he sent the last vnto
them, saying, They will reuerence my
sonne. 7 But ye husbandmen said among
themselues, This is the heire: come, let vs
kill him, and the inheritance shalbe ours.
8 So they tooke him, and killed him, and
cast him out of the vineyard. 9 What shall
then the Lord of the vineyard doe? He
will come and destroy these husbandmen,
and giue the vineyard to others. 10 Haue
ye not read so much as this Scripture?
The stone which the builders did refuse,
is made the head of the corner. 11 This
was done of the Lord, and it is marueilous
in our eyes. 12 Then they went about to
take him, but they feared the people: for
they perceiued that he spake that parable
against them: therefore they left him, and
went their way. 13 And they sent vnto
him certaine of the Pharises, and of ye
Herodians that they might take him in
Mark 12:29
his talke. 14 And when they came, they
saide vnto him, Master, we know that
thou art true, and carest for no man: for
thou considerest not the person of men,
but teachest the way of God truely, Is it
lawfull to giue tribute to Cesar, or not?
15 Should we giue it, or should we not giue
it? but he knew their hypocrisie, and said
vnto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a
peny, that I may see it. 16 So they brought
it, and he said vnto them, Whose is this
image and superscription? and they said
vnto him, Cesars. 17 Then Iesus answered,
and saide vnto them, Giue to Cesar the
things that are Cesars, and to God, those
that are Gods: and they marueiled at
him. 18 Then came the Sadduces vnto
him, (which say, there is no resurrection)
and they asked him, saying, 19 Master,
Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother
die, and leaue his wife, and leaue no
children, that his brother should take
his wife, and rayse vp seede vnto his
brother. 20 There were seuen brethren,
and the first tooke a wife, and when he
died, left no issue. 21 Then the seconde
tooke her, and he died, neither did he yet
leaue issue, and the third likewise: 22 So
those seuen had her, and left no yssue:
last of all the wife died also. 23 In the
resurrection then, when they shall rise
againe, whose wife shall she be of them?
for seuen had her to wife. 24 Then Iesus
answered, and saide vnto them, Are ye
not therefore deceiued, because ye knowe
not the Scriptures, neither the power of
God? 25 For when they shall rise againe
from the dead, neither men marry, nor
wiues are married, but are as the Angels
which are in heauen. 26 And as touching
the dead, that they shall rise againe, haue
ye not read in the booke of Moses, howe
in the bush God spake vnto him, saying,
I am the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? 27 God is
not ye God of the dead, but the God of the
liuing. Ye are therefore greatly deceiued.
28 Then came one of the Scribes that
had heard them disputing together, and
perceiuing that he had answered them
well, he asked him, Which is the first
commandement of all? 29 Iesus answeredMark 12:30
880
him, The first of all the commandements
is, Heare, Israel, The Lord our God is the
onely Lord. 30 Thou shalt therefore loue
the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
and with all thy soule, and with all thy
minde, and with all thy strength: this
is the first commandement. 31 And the
second is like, that is, Thou shalt loue
thy neighbour as thy selfe. There is none
other commandement greater then these.
32 Then that Scribe said vnto him, Well,
Master, thou hast saide the trueth, that
there is one God, and that there is none
but he, 33 And to loue him with all the
heart, and with all the vnderstanding,
and with all the soule, and with all the
strength, and to loue his neighbour as
himselfe, is more then all whole burnt
offerings and sacrifices. 34 Then when
Iesus saw that he answered discreetely,
he saide vnto him, Thou art not farre
from the kingdome of God. And no man
after that durst aske him any question.
35 And Iesus answered and said teaching
in the Temple, Howe say the Scribes that
Christ is the sonne of Dauid? 36 For
Dauid himselfe said by ye holy Ghost,
The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my
right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
footestoole. 37 Then Dauid himselfe cal-
leth him Lord: by what meanes is he then
his sonne? and much people heard him
gladly. 38 Moreouer he saide vnto them
in his doctrine, Beware of the Scribes
which loue to goe in long robes, and loue
salutations in the markets, 39 And the
chiefe seates in the Synagogues, and the
first roumes at feastes, 40 Which deuoure
widowes houses, euen vnder a colour of
long prayers. These shall receiue the
greater damnation. 41 And as Iesus sate
ouer against the treasurie, he beheld how
the people cast money into the treasurie,
and many rich men cast in much. 42 And
there came a certaine poore widowe, and
she threw in two mites, which make a
quadrin. 43 Then he called vnto him his
disciples, and said vnto them, Verely I say
vnto you, that this poore widowe hath
cast more in, then all they which haue
cast into the treasurie. 44 For they all did
cast in of their superfluitie: but she of her
Mark 13:14
pouertie did cast in all that she had, euen
all her liuing.
1 And
13
as he went out of the Temple,
one of his disciples said vnto him, Master,
see what maner stones, and what maner
buildings are here. 2 Then Iesus answered
and saide vnto him, Seest thou these great
buildings? there shall not be left one
stone vpon a stone, that shall not be
throwen downe. 3 And as he sate on the
mount of Oliues, ouer against the Temple,
Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and Andrew
asked him secretly, 4 Tell vs, when shall
these things be? and what shalbe the
signe when all these things shalbe ful-
filled? 5 And Iesus answered them, and
began to say, Take heede lest any man
deceiue you. 6 For many shall come in my
Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall de-
ceiue many. 7 Furthermore when ye shall
heare, of warres, and rumours of warres,
be ye not troubled: for such things must
needes be: but the end shall not be yet.
8 For nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdome against kingdome, and there
shalbe earthquakes in diuers quarters,
and there shalbe famine and troubles:
these are the beginnings of sorowes. 9 But
take ye heede to your selues: for they
shall deliuer you vp to the Councils, and
to the Synagogues: ye shalbe beaten, and
brought before rulers and Kings for my
sake, for a testimoniall vnto them. 10 And
the Gospel must first be published among
all nations. 11 But when they leade you,
and deliuer you vp, be not carefull before
hand, neither studie what ye shall say:
but what is giuen you at the same time,
that speake: for it is not ye that speake,
but the holy Ghost. 12 Yea, and the brother
shall deliuer the brother to death, and
the father the sonne, and the children
shall rise against their parents, and shall
cause them to die. 13 And ye shall be
hated of all men for my Names sake: but
whosoeuer shall endure vnto the end, he
shalbe saued. 14 Moreouer, when ye shall
see the abomination of desolation (spoken
of by Daniel the Prophet) set where itMark 13:15
881
ought not, (let him that readeth, consider
it) then let them that be in Iudea, flee
into the mountaines, 15 And let him that is
vpon the house, not come downe into the
house, neither enter therein, to fetch any
thing out of his house. 16 And let him that
is in the fielde, not turne backe againe
to take his garment. 17 Then wo shalbe
to the that are with child, and to them
that giue sucke in those dayes. 18 Pray
therefore that your flight be not in the
winter. 19 For those dayes shalbe such
tribulation, as was not from the beginning
of ye creation which God created vnto
this time, neither shalbe. 20 And except
that the Lord had shortened those dayes,
no flesh shoulde be saued: but for the
elects sake, which he hath chosen, he hath
shortened those dayes. 21 Then if any man
say to you, Loe, here is Christ, or, lo, he is
there, beleeue it not. 22 For false Christes
shall rise, and false prophets, and shall
shewe signes and wonders, to deceiue if
it were possible the very elect. 23 But take
ye heede: beholde, I haue shewed you
all things before. 24 Moreouer in those
dayes, after that tribulation, the sunne
shall waxe darke, and ye moone shall not
giue her light, 25 And the starres of heauen
shall fall: and the powers which are in
heauen, shall shake. 26 And then shall
they see the Sonne of man comming in
ye cloudes, with great power and glory.
27 And he shall then send his Angels,
and shall gather together his elect from
the foure windes, and from the vtmost
part of the earth to the vtmost part of
heauen. 28 Nowe learne a parable of
the figge tree. When her bough is yet
tender, and it bringeth foorth leaues, ye
knowe that sommer is neere. 29 So in like
maner, when ye see these things come
to passe, knowe that the kingdom of God
is neere, euen at the doores. 30 Verely I
say vnto you, that this generation shall
not passe, till all these things be done.
31 Heauen and earth shall passe away,
but my woordes shall not passe away.
32 But of that day and houre knoweth
no man, no, not the Angels which are
in heauen, neither the Sonne himselfe,
Mark 14:11
but the Father. 33 Take heede: watch,
and praie: for yee knowe not when the
time is. 34 For the Sonne of man is as a
man going into a strange countrey, and
leaueth his house, and giueth authoritie
to his seruaunts, and to euery man his
woorke, and commandeth the porter to
watch. 35 Watch ye therefore, (for ye
know not whe ye master of the house will
come, at eue, or at midnight, at the cocke
crowing, or in the dawning,) 36 Least if
he come suddenly, he should finde you
sleeping. 37 And those things that I say
vnto you, I say vnto all men, Watch.
14
And two daies after followed the
feast of the Passeouer, and of vnleauened
bread: and the hie Priests, and Scribes
sought how they might take him by craft,
and put him to death. 2 But they sayde,
Not in the feast day, least there be any
tumult among the people. 3 And when
hee was in Bethania in the house of
Simon the leper, as he sate at table,
there came a woman hauing a boxe of
oyntment of spikenarde, very costly, and
shee brake the boxe, and powred it on
his head. 4 Therefore some disdained
among themselues, and sayde, To what
ende is this waste of oyntment? 5 For it
might haue bene sold for more then three
hundreth pence, and bene giuen vnto the
poore, and they murmured against her.
6 But Iesus saide, Let her alone: why
trouble yee her? shee hath wrought a
good worke on me. 7 For yee haue the
poore with you alwaies, and when yee
will yee may doe them good, but me
yee shall not haue alwaies. 8 She hath
done that she coulde: she came afore
hand to anoynt my body to the burying.
9 Verely I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this
Gospel shall be preached throughout the
whole world, this also that she hath done,
shalbe spoken of in remembrance of her.
10 Then Iudas Iscariot, one of the twelue,
went away vnto the hie Priestes, to betray
him vnto them. 11 And when they heard
it, they were glad, and promised that
they woulde giue him monie: therefore
1Mark 14:12
882
he sought howe he might conueniently
betraie him. 12 Nowe the first day of vn-
leauened bread, when they sacrificed the
Passeouer, his disciples sayde vnto him,
Where wilt thou that we goe and prepare,
that thou mayest eate the Passeouer?
13 Then hee sent foorth two of his disci-
ples, and sayde vnto them, Goe yee into
the citie, and there shall a man meete
you bearing a pitcher of water: follow
him. 14 And whithersoeuer he goeth in,
say yee to the good man of the house,
The Master sayeth, Where is the lodging
where I shall eate the Passeouer with my
disciples? 15 And he wil shewe you an
vpper chamber which is large, trimmed
and prepared: there make it readie for vs.
16 So his disciples went foorth, and came
to the citie, and found as he had said vnto
them, and made readie the Passeouer.
17 And at euen he came with the twelue.
18 And as they sate at table and did eate,
Iesus said, Verely I say vnto you, that one
of you shall betray me, which eateth with
me. 19 Then they began to be sorowful
and to say to him one by one, Is it I? And
another, Is it I? 20 And he answered and
sayde vnto them, It is one of the twelue
that dippeth with mee in the platter.
21 Truely the Sonne of man goeth his way,
as it is written of him: but woe bee to
that man, by whome the Sonne of man is
betrayed: it had beene good for that man,
if hee had neuer beene borne. 22 And as
they did eate, Iesus tooke the bread, and
when hee had giuen thankes, he brake
it and gaue it to them, and sayde, Take,
eate, this is my bodie. 23 Also he tooke the
cuppe, and when he had giuen thankes,
gaue it to them: and they all dranke of
it. 24 And he saide vnto them, This is my
blood of that newe Testament, which is
shed for many. 25 Verely I say vnto you, I
wil drinke no more of the fruit of ye vine
vntill that day, that I drinke it newe in the
kingdome of God. 26 And when they had
sung a Psalme, they went out to the mount
of Oliues. 27 Then Iesus said vnto them, Al
ye shall be offended by mee this night: for
it is written, I will smite the shepheard,
and the sheepe shall be scattered. 28 But
Mark 14:45
after that I am risen, I will goe into Galile
before you. 29 And Peter saide vnto him,
Although all men should be offended at
thee, yet would not I. 30 Then Iesus saide
vnto him, Verely I say vnto thee, this day,
euen in this night, before the cocke crowe
twise, thou shalt denie me thrise. 31 But
he saide more earnestly. If I shoulde die
with thee, I will not denie thee: likewise
also saide they all. 32 After, they came
into a place named Gethsemane: then
hee saide to his disciples, Sit yee here,
till I haue praied. 33 And hee tooke with
him Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and
hee began to be troubled, and in great
heauinesse, 34 And saide vnto them, My
soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death:
tarie here, and watch. 35 So he went
forward a litle, and fell downe on the
ground, and praied, that if it were pos-
sible, that houre might passe from him.
36 And he saide, Abba, Father, all things
are possible vnto thee: take away this
cup from me: neuertheles not that I will,
but that thou wilt, be done. 37 Then hee
came, and founde them sleeping, and said
to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest
not thou watche one houre? 38 Watch
ye, and pray, that ye enter not into
tentation: the spirite in deede is ready,
but the flesh is weake. 39 And againe hee
went away, and praied, and spake the
same wordes. 40 And he returned, and
founde them a sleepe againe: for their
eyes were heauie: neither knewe they
what they should answere him. 41 And
he came the third time, and said vnto
them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your
rest: it is ynough: the houre is come:
beholde, the Sonne of man is deliuered
into the hands of sinners. 42 Rise vp: let
vs go: loe, he that betraieth me, is at
hand. 43 And immediatly while hee yet
spake, came Iudas that was one of the
twelue, and with him a great multitude
with swordes and staues from the hie
Priests, and Scribes, and Elders. 44 And
he that betraied him, had giuen them a
token, saying, Whomsoeuer I shall kisse,
he it is: take him and leade him away
safely. 45 And assoone as hee was come,Mark 14:46
hee went straightway to him, and saide,
Haile Master, and kissed him. 46 Then
they laide their handes on him, and tooke
him. 47 And one of them that stoode
by, drewe out a sword, and smote a
seruant of the hie Priest, and cut off his
eare. 48 And Iesus answered and saide to
them, Ye be come out as against a thiefe
with swordes, and with staues, to take
me. 49 I was daily with you teaching in
the Temple, and yee tooke me not: but
this is done that the Scriptures should
be fulfilled. 50 Then they all forsooke
him, and fled. 51 And there followed him
a certaine yong man, clothed in linnen
vpon his bare bodie, and the yong men
caught him. 52 But he left his linnen cloth,
and fled from them naked. 53 So they
led Iesus away to the hie Priest, and to
him came together all the hie Priestes,
and the Elders, and the Scribes. 54 And
Peter folowed him afarre off, euen into
the hall of the hie Priest, and sate with
the seruants, and warmed himselfe at
the fire. 55 And the hie Priests, and all
the Councill sought for witnesse against
Iesus, to put him to death, but found
none. 56 For many bare false witnesse
against him, but their witnesse agreed not
together. 57 Then there arose certaine,
and bare false witnesse against him, say-
ing, 58 We hearde him say, I will destroy
this Temple made with hands, and within
three daies I will builde another, made
without hands. 59 But their witnesse yet
agreed not together. 60 Then the hie Priest
stoode vp amongst them, and asked Iesus,
saying, Answerest thou nothing? what
is the matter that these beare witnesse
against thee? 61 But hee helde his peace,
and answered nothing. Againe the hie
Priest asked him, and sayde vnto him, Art
thou that Christ the Sonne of the Blessed?
62 And Iesus said, I am he, and yee shall
see the Sonne of man sitte at the right
hande of the power of God, and come in
the clouds of heauen. 63 Then the hie
Priest rent his clothes, and sayd, What
haue we any more neede of witnesses?
64 Ye haue heard the blasphemie: what
thinke yee? And they all condemned him
to be worthie of death. 65 And some began
883
Mark 15:9
to spit at him, and to couer his face, and
to beate him with fists, and to say vnto
him, Prophesie. And the sergeants smote
him with their roddes. 66 And as Peter
was beneath in the hal, there came one of
the maides of the hie Priest. 67 And when
shee sawe Peter warming him selfe, shee
looked on him, and sayde, Thou wast also
with Iesus of Nazareth. 68 But he denied
it, saying, I knowe him not, neither wot I
what thou saiest. Then he went out into
the porche, and the cocke crewe. 69 Then
a maid sawe him againe, and bega to say
to them that stood by, This is one of them.
70 But hee denied it againe: and anon
after, they that stoode by, sayde againe to
Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for
thou art of Galile, and thy speach is like.
71 And he began to curse, and sweare,
saying, I knowe not this man of whom
ye speake. 72 Then the seconde time the
cocke crewe, and Peter remembred the
woorde that Iesus had saide vnto him,
Before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt
denie me thrise, and waying that with
himselfe, he wept.
1 And
15
anon in the dawning, the hie
Priestes helde a Councill with the Elders,
and the Scribes, and the whole Council,
and bound Iesus, and led him away, and
deliuered him to Pilate. 2 Then Pilate
asked him, Art thou the King of the Iewes?
And hee answered, and sayde vnto him,
Thou sayest it. 3 And the hie Priestes
accused him of many things. 4 Wherefore
Pilate asked him againe, saying, Answer-
est thou nothing? beholde howe many
things they witnesse against thee. 5 But
Iesus answered no more at all, so that
Pilate marueiled. 6 Nowe at the feast,
Pilate did deliuer a prisoner vnto them,
whomesoeuer they woulde desire. 7 Then
there was one named Barabbas, which
was bounde with his fellowes, that had
made insurrection, who in the insurrec-
tion had committed murder. 8 And the
people cried aloude, and began to desire
that he woulde doe as he had euer done
vnto them. 9 Then Pilate answered them,
and said, Will ye that I let loose vnto youMark 15:10
884
the King of ye Iewes? 10 For he knewe
that the hie Priestes had deliuered him of
enuie. 11 But the high Priestes had moued
the people to desire that he would rather
deliuer Barabbas vnto them. 12 And Pilate
answered, and said againe vnto them,
What will ye then that I doe with him,
whom ye call the King of the Iewes?
13 And they cried againe, Crucifie him.
14 Then Pilate said vnto them, But what
euill hath he done? And they cryed the
more feruently, Crucifie him. 15 So Pilate
willing to content the people, loosed them
Barabbas, and deliuered Iesus, when he
had scourged him, that he might be
crucified. 16 Then the souldiers led him
away into the hall, which is the common
hall, and called together the whole band,
17 And clad him with purple, and platted
a crowne of thornes, and put it about
his head, 18 And began to salute him,
saying, Haile, King of the Iewes. 19 And
they smote him on the head with a reede,
and spat vpon him, and bowed the knees,
and did him reuerence. 20 And whe they
had mocked him, they tooke the purple
off him, and put his owne clothes on
him, and led him out to crucifie him.
21 And they compelled one that passed
by, called Simon of Cyrene (which came
out of the countrey, and was father of
Alexander and Rufus) to beare his crosse.
22 And they brought him to a place named
Golgotha, which is by interpretation, the
place of dead mens skulles. 23 And they
gaue him to drinke wine mingled with
myrrhe: but he receiued it not. 24 And
when they had crucified him, they parted
his garments, casting lots for them, what
euery man should haue. 25 And it was
the third houre, when they crucified him.
26 And ye title of his cause was written
aboue, THAT KING OF THE JEWES. 27 They
crucified also with him two theeues, the
one on ye right hand, and the other on
his left. 28 Thus the Scripture was fulfilled,
which sayth, And he was counted among
the wicked. 29 And they that went by,
railed on him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Hey, thou that destroyest the
Temple, and buildest it in three dayes,
Mark 15:46
30 Saue thy selfe, and come downe from
the crosse. 31 Likewise also euen the hie
Priests mocking, said among themselues
with the Scribes, He saued other men,
himselfe he cannot saue. 32 Let Christ
the King of Israel nowe come downe
from the crosse, that we may see, and
beleeue. They also that were crucified
with him, reuiled him. 33 Nowe when the
sixt houre was come, darkenesse arose
ouer all the land vntill the ninth houre.
34 And at the ninth houre Iesus cryed with
a loude voyce, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lamma-
sabachthani? which is by interpretation,
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me? 35 And some of them that stoode
by, when they heard it, said, Behold,
he calleth Elias. 36 And one ranne, and
filled a spondge full of vineger, and put
it on a reede, and gaue him to drinke,
saying, Let him alone: let vs see if Elias
will come, and take him downe. 37 And
Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and gaue
vp the ghost. 38 And the vaile of the
Temple was rent in twaine, from the
toppe to the bottome. 39 Nowe when
the Centurion, which stoode ouer against
him, sawe that he thus crying gaue vp the
ghost, he saide, Truely this man was the
Sonne of God. 40 There were also women,
which beheld afarre off, among whom
was Marie Magdalene, and Marie (the
mother of Iames the lesse, and of Ioses)
and Salome, 41 Which also when he was in
Galile, folowed him, and ministred vnto
him, and many other women which came
vp with him vnto Hierusalem. 42 And
nowe when the night was come (because
it was the day of the preparation that
is before the Sabbath) 43 Ioseph of Ari-
mathea, an honorable counsellour, which
also looked for the kingdome of God,
came, and went in boldly vnto Pilate, and
asked the body of Iesus. 44 And Pilate
marueiled, if he were already dead, and
called vnto him the Centurion, and asked
of him whether he had bene any while
dead. 45 And when he knewe the trueth
of the Centurion, he gaue the body to
Ioseph: 46 Who bought a linnen cloth,
and tooke him downe, and wrapped him
in the linnen cloth, and laide him in aMark 15:47
885
tombe that was hewen out of a rocke,
and rolled a stone vnto the doore of the
sepulchre: 47 And Marie Magdalene, and
Marie Ioses mother, behelde where he
should be layed.
16
1 And when the Sabbath day was past,
Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother
of Iames, and Salome, bought sweete
oyntments, that they might come, and
anoynt him. 2 Therefore early in the
morning, the first day of the weeke, they
came vnto the sepulchre, when the Sunne
was nowe risen. 3 And they saide one
to another, Who shall rolle vs away the
stone from the doore of the sepulchre?
4 And when they looked, they saw that
the stone was rolled away (for it was a
very great one) 5 So they went into the
sepulchre, and saw a yong man sitting
at the right side, clothed in a long white
robe: and they were sore troubled. 6 But
he said vnto them, Be not so troubled:
ye seeke Iesus of Nazareth, which hath
bene crucified: he is risen, he is not here:
behold the place where they put him.
7 But goe your way, and tell his disciples,
and Peter, that he will goe before you
into Galile: there shall ye see him, as
he said vnto you. 8 And they went out
quickly, and fled from the sepulchre: for
they trembled, and were amased: neither
said they any thing to any man: for they
were afraide. 9 And when Iesus was risen
againe, early the first day of the weeke,
he appeared first to Marie Magdalene,
out of whom he had cast seuen deuils:
10 And shee went and tolde them that had
bene with him, which mourned and wept.
11 And when they heard that he was aliue,
and had appeared to her, they beleeued it
not. 12 After that, he appeared vnto two of
them in an other forme, as they walked
13 And
and went into the countrey.
they went, and told it to the remnant,
neither beleeued they them. 14 Finally,
he appeared vnto the eleuen as they sate
together, and reproched them for their
vnbeliefe and hardnesse of heart, because
they beleeued not them which had seene
Mark 16:20
him, being risen vp againe. 15 And he
saide vnto them, Goe ye into all the
worlde, and preach the Gospel to euery
creature. 16 He that shall beleeue and be
baptized, shalbe saued: but he that will
not beleeue, shalbe damned. 17 And these
tokens shall folowe them that beleeue, In
my Name they shall cast out deuils, and
shall speake with newe tongues, 18 And
shall take away serpents, and if they shall
drinke any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
them: they shall lay their handes on the
sicke, and they shall recouer. 19 So after
ye Lord had spoken vnto them, he was
receiued into heauen, and sate at the right
hand of God. 20 And they went foorth,
and preached euery where. And the Lord
wrought with them, and confirmed the
worde with signes that folowed. Amen.Luke 1:1
886
THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE
1 Forasmuch
as many haue taken in
hand to set foorth the storie of those
things, whereof we are fully persuaded,
2 As they haue deliuered them vnto vs,
which from the beginning saw them their
selues, and were ministers of ye word,
3 It seemed good also to me (most noble
Theophilus) assoone as I had searched out
perfectly all things from the beginning,
to write vnto thee thereof from point to
point, 4 That thou mightest acknowledge
the certaintie of those things, whereof
thou hast bene instructed. 5 In the time
of Herod King of Iudea, there was a
certaine Priest named Zacharias, of the
course of Abia: and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was
Elisabet. 6 Both were iust before God, and
walked in all the commandements and
ordinances of the Lord, without reproofe.
7 And they had no childe, because that
Elisabet was barren: and both were well
stricken in age. 8 And it came to passe, as
he executed the Priestes office before God,
as his course came in order, 9 According
to the custome of the Priests office, his lot
was to burne incense, when he went into
the Temple of the Lord. 10 And the whole
multitude of the people were without in
prayer, while the incense was burning.
11 Then appeared vnto him an Angel of
the Lord standing at the right side of the
altar of incense. 12 And when Zacharias
sawe him, he was troubled, and feare
fell vpon him. 13 But the Angel saide
vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias: for thy
prayer is heard, and thy wise Elisabet
shall beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt
call his name Iohn. 14 And thou shalt haue
ioy and gladnes, and many shall reioyce
at his birth. 15 For he shalbe great in
the sight of the Lord, and shall neither
drinke wine, nor strong drinke: and he
shalbe filled with the holy Ghost, euen
from his mothers wombe. 16 And many
of the children of Israel shall he turne
to their Lord God. 17 For he shall goe
Luke 1:33
before him in the spirite and power of
Elias, to turne the hearts of the fathers to
the children, and the disobedient to the
wisedome of the iust men, to make ready
a people prepared for the Lord. 18 Then
Zacharias said vnto ye Angel, Whereby
shall I knowe this? for I am an olde man,
and my wife is of a great age. 19 And the
Angell answered, and sayde vnto him, I
am Gabriel that stand in the presence of
God, and am sent to speake vnto thee, and
to shew thee these good tidings. 20 And
beholde, thou shalt be domme, and not be
able to speake, vntill the day that these
things be done, because thou beleeuedst
not my words, which shalbe fulfilled in
their season. 21 Now the people waited for
Zacharias, and marueiled that he taried
so long in the Temple. 22 And when hee
came out, hee coulde not speake vnto
them: then they perceiued that hee had
seene a vision in the Temple: For he
made signes vnto them, and remained
domme. 23 And it came to passe, when the
daies of his office were fulfilled, that he
departed to his owne house. 24 And after
those daies, his wife Elisabet conceiued,
and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying,
25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me, in the
daies wherein he looked on me, to take
from me my rebuke among men. 26 And
in the sixth moneth, the Angell Gabriel
was sent from God vnto a citie of Galile,
named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin affianced
to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the
house of Dauid, and the virgins name
was Marie. 28 And the Angel went in
vnto her, and said, Haile thou that art
freely beloued: the Lord is with thee:
blessed art thou among women. 29 And
when she saw him, she was troubled at
his saying, and thought what maner of
salutation that should be. 30 Then the
Angel saide vnto her, Feare not, Marie:
for thou hast found fauour with God.
31 For loe, thou shalt conceiue in thy wobe,
and beare a sonne, and shalt call his name
Iesus. 32 He shall be great, and shall be
called the Sonne of the most High, and
the Lord God shall giue vnto him the
throne of his father Dauid. 33 And heeLuke 1:34
887
shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for
euer, and of his kingdome shall bee none
ende. 34 Then sayde Marie vnto the Angel,
How shall this be, seeing I knowe not
man? 35 And the Angel answered, and
said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come
vpon thee, and the power of the most
High shall ouershadowe thee: therefore
also that holy thing which shall bee borne
of thee, shall be called the Sonne of God.
36 And behold, thy cousin Elisabet, she
hath also conceiued a sonne in her olde
age: and this is her sixt moneth, which
was called barren. 37 For with God shall
nothing be vnpossible. 38 Then Marie
said, Behold the seruant of the Lord: be it
vnto me according to thy woorde. So the
Angel departed from her. 39 And Marie
arose in those daies, and went into ye
hil countrey with hast to a citie of Iuda,
40 And entred into the house of Zacharias,
and saluted Elisabet. 41 And it came to
passe, as Elisabet heard the salutation of
Marie, the babe sprang in her bellie, and
Elisabet was filled with the holy Ghost.
42 And she cried with a loud voice, and
saide, Blessed art thou among women,
because the fruit of thy wombe is blessed.
43 And whence commeth this to mee, that
the mother of my Lord should come to
me? 44 For loe, assoone as the voice
of thy salutation sounded in mine eares,
the babe sprang in my bellie for ioye,
45 And blessed is shee that beleeued: for
those things shall be perfourmed, which
were tolde her from the Lord. 46 Then
Marie sayde, My soule magnifieth the
Lord, 47 And my spirite reioyceth in God
my Sauiour. 48 For hee hath looked on the
poore degree of his seruaunt: for beholde,
from henceforth shall all ages call me
blessed, 49 Because hee that is mightie,
hath done for me great things, and holy
is his Name. 50 And his mercie is from
generation to generation on them that
feare him. 51 Hee hath shewed strength
with his arme: hee hath scattered the
proude in the imagination of their hearts.
52 Hee hath put downe the mighty from
their seates, and exalted them of lowe
degree. 53 Hee hath filled the hungrie
with good things, and sent away the rich
Luke 1:75
emptie. 54 Hee hath vpholden Israel his
seruaunt to be mindefull of his mercie
55 (As hee hath spoken to our fathers, to
wit, to Abraham, and his seede) for euer.
56 And Marie abode with her about three
moneths: after, shee returned to her
owne house. 57 Nowe Elisabets time was
fulfilled, that shee should be deliuered,
and shee brought foorth a sonne. 58 And
her neighbours, and cousins heard tell
howe the Lord had shewed his great
mercie vpon her, and they reioyced with
her. 59 And it was so that on the eight
day they came to circumcise the babe, and
called him Zacharias after the name of
his father. 60 But his mother answered,
and saide, Not so, but he shalbe called
Iohn. 61 And they saide vnto her, There
is none of thy kindred, that is named
with this name. 62 Then they made signes
to his father, howe he would haue him
called. 63 So hee asked for writing tables,
and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn, and
they marueiled all. 64 And his mouth was
opened immediately, and his tongue, and
he spake and praised God. 65 Then feare
came on all them that dwelt neere vnto
them, and all these woordes were noised
abroade throughout all the hill countrey
of Iudea. 66 And al they that heard them,
laid them vp in their hearts, saying, What
maner childe shall this be! and the hand
of the Lord was with him. 67 Then his
father Zacharias was filled with the holy
Ghost, and prophesied, saying, 68 Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel, because he hath
visited and redeemed his people, 69 And
hath raised vp the horne of saluation vnto
vs, in the house of his seruant Dauid,
70 As he spake by ye mouth of his holy
Prophets, which were since the world
began, saying, 71 That he would sende vs
deliuerance from our enemies, and from
the hands of all that hate vs, 72 That he
might shewe mercie towards our fathers,
and remember his holy couenant, 73 And
the othe which he sware to our father
Abraham. 74 Which was, that he would
graunt vnto vs, that we being deliuered
out of the handes of our enemies, should
serue him without feare, 75 All the daies of
our life, in holinesse and righteousnesseLuke 1:76
888
before him. 76 And thou, babe, shalt
be called the Prophet of the most High:
for thou shalt goe before the face of
the Lord, to prepare his waies, 77 And
to giue knowledge of saluation vnto his
people, by the remission of their sinnes,
78 Through ye tender mercy of our God,
wherby the day spring from an hie hath
visited vs, 79 To giue light to them that
sit in darknes, and in the shadow of
death, and to guide our feete into the
way of peace. 80 And the childe grewe,
and waxed strong in spirit, and was in
the wildernesse, til the day came that he
should shewe him selfe vnto Israel.
2
1 And it came to passe in those dayes,
that there came a decree from Augustus
Cesar, that all the world should be taxed.
2 (This first taxing was made when Cyre-
nius was gouernour of Syria.) 3 Therefore
went all to be taxed, euery man to his
owne Citie. 4 And Ioseph also went vp
from Galile out of a citie called Nazareth,
into Iudea, vnto the citie of Dauid, which
is called Beth-leem (because he was of
the house and linage of Dauid,) 5 To bee
taxed with Marie that was giuen him to
wife, which was with childe. 6 And so it
was, that while they were there, the daies
were accomplished that shee shoulde be
deliuered, 7 And she brought foorth her
first begotten sonne, and wrapped him
in swadling clothes, and laide him in a
cratch, because there was no roome for
them in the ynne. 8 And there were in
the same countrey shepheards, abiding
in the fielde, and keeping watch by night
ouer their flocke. 9 And loe, the Angel
of the Lord came vpon them, and the
glorie of the Lord shone about them,
and they were sore afraide. 10 Then the
Angel saide vnto them, Be not afraid: for
behold, I bring you glad tidings of great
ioy, that shalbe to all the people, 11 That
is, that vnto you is borne this day in the
citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is Christ
the Lord. 12 And this shalbe a signe to
you, Yee shall finde the babe swadled,
and laid in a cratch. 13 And straightway
Luke 2:29
there was with the Angel a multitude
of heauenly souldiers, praising God, and
saying, 14 Glory be to God in the high
heauens, and peace in earth, and towards
men good will. 15 And it came to passe
whe the Angels were gone away from
them into heauen, that the shepheards
sayde one to another, Let vs goe then vnto
Beth-leem, and see this thing that is come
to passe which the Lord hath shewed vnto
vs. 16 So they came with haste, and founde
both Marie and Ioseph, and the babe laid
in the cratch. 17 And when they had seene
it, they published abroade the thing, that
was tolde them of that childe. 18 And all
that heard it, wondred at ye things which
were tolde them of the shepheards. 19 But
Mary kept all those sayings, and pondred
them in her heart. 20 And the shepheardes
returned glorifiyng and praising God, for
all that they had heard and seene as it
was spoken vnto them. 21 And when the
eight daies were accomplished, that they
shoulde circumcise the childe, his name
was then called Iesus, which was named
of the Angell, before he was conceiued
in the wombe. 22 And when the daies
of her purification after the Lawe of
Moses were accomplished, they brought
him to Hierusalem, to present him to the
Lord, 23 (As it is written in the Lawe
of the Lord, Euery man childe that first
openeth ye wombe, shalbe called holy
to the Lord) 24 And to giue an oblation,
as it is commanded in the Lawe of the
Lord, a paire of turtle doues, or two yong
pigeons. 25 And behold, there was a man
in Hierusalem, whose name was Simeon:
this man was iust, and feared God, and
waited for the consolation of Israel, and
the holy Ghost was vpon him. 26 And
it was declared to him from God by the
holy Ghost, that he shoulde not see death,
before he had seene that Anointed of the
Lord. 27 And he came by the motion
of the spirit into the Temple, and when
the parents brought in the babe Iesus,
to do for him after the custome of the
Lawe, 28 Then hee tooke him in his armes,
and praised God, and sayd, 29 Lord, nowe
lettest thou thy seruaunt depart in peace,Luke 2:30
according to thy woorde, 30 For mine
eyes haue seene thy saluation, 31 Which
thou hast prepared before the face of all
people, 32 A light to be reueiled to the Gen-
tiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
33 And Ioseph and his mother marueiled
at those things, which were spoken touch-
ing him. 34 And Simeon blessed them,
and saide vnto Mary his mother, Beholde,
this childe is appointed for the fall and
rising againe of many in Israel, and for a
signe which shalbe spoken against, 35 (Yea
and a sworde shall pearce through thy
soule) that the thoughts of many heartes
may be opened. 36 And there was a
Prophetesse, one Anna the daughter of
Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, which was
of a great age, after she had liued with an
husband seuen yeeres from her virginitie:
37 And she was widowe about foure score
and foure yeeres, and went not out of
the Temple, but serued God with fastings
and prayers, night and day. 38 She then
coming at the same instant vpon them,
confessed likewise the Lord, and spake
of him to all that looked for redemption
in Hierusalem. 39 And when they had
performed all thinges according to the
lawe of the Lord, they returned into Galile
to their owne citie Nazareth. 40 And the
childe grewe, and waxed strong in Spirit,
and was filled with wisedome, and the
grace of God was with him. 41 Nowe his
parents went to Hierusalem euery yeere,
at the feast of the Passeouer. 42 And
when hee was twelue yeere olde, and they
were come vp to Hierusalem, after the
custome of the feast, 43 And had finished
the dayes thereof, as they returned, the
childe Iesus remained in Hierusalem, and
Ioseph knew not, nor his mother, 44 But
they supposing, that he had bene in the
company, went a dayes iourney, and
sought him among their kinsfolke, and
acquaintance. 45 And when they found
him not, they turned backe to Hierusalem,
and sought him. 46 And it came to passe
three dayes after, that they found him
in the Temple, sitting in the mids of the
doctours, both hearing them, and asking
them questions: 47 And all that heard him,
889
Luke 3:9
were astonied at his vnderstanding and
answeres. 48 So when they sawe him, they
were amased, and his mother said vnto
him, Sonne, why hast thou thus dealt with
vs? beholde, thy father and I haue sought
thee with very heauie hearts. 49 Then
said he vnto them, Howe is it that ye
sought me? knewe ye not that I must goe
about my Fathers busines? 50 But they
vnderstoode not the word that he spake
to them. 51 Then hee went downe with
them, and came to Nazareth, and was
subiect to them: and his mother kept all
these sayings in her heart. 52 And Iesus
increased in wisedome, and stature, and
in fauour with God and men.
1 Nowe
3
in the fifteenth yeere of the
reigne of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate
being gouernour of Iudea, and Herod
being Tetrarch of Galile, and his brother
Philip Tetrarch of Iturea, and of the
countrey of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
Tetrarch of Abilene, 2 (When Annas and
Caiaphas were the hie Priestes) the worde
of God came vnto Iohn, the sonne of
Zacharias in the wildernes. 3 And hee
came into all the coastes about Iordan,
preaching the baptisme of repentance for
the remission of sinnes, 4 As it is written
in the booke of the sayings of Esaias the
Prophet, which saith, The voyce of him
that crieth in the wildernes is, Prepare
ye the way of the Lord: make his paths
straight. 5 Euery valley shalbe filled, and
euery mountaine and hill shall be brought
lowe, and crooked things shalbe made
straight, and the rough wayes shalbe
made smoothe. 6 And all flesh shall see
the saluation of God. 7 Then said he to the
people that were come out to be baptized
of him, O generations of vipers, who hath
forewarned you to flee from the wrath
to come? 8 Bring foorth therefore fruites
worthy amendment of life, and beginne
not to say with your selues, We haue
Abraham to our father: for I say vnto you,
that God is able of these stones to raise
vp children vnto Abraham. 9 Nowe also is
the axe layed vnto the roote of the trees:
therefore euery tree which bringeth notLuke 3:10
foorth good fruite, shalbe hewen downe,
and cast into the fire. 10 Then the people
asked him, saying, What shall we doe
then? 11 And he answered, and said vnto
them, He that hath two coates, let him
part with him that hath none: and hee
that hath meate, let him doe likewise.
12 Then came there Publicanes also to
bee baptized, and saide vnto him, Master,
what shall we doe? 13 And hee saide vnto
them, Require no more then that which
is appointed vnto you. 14 The souldiers
likewise demaunded of him, saying, And
what shall we doe? And he saide vnto
them, Doe violence to no man, neither
accuse any falsely, and be content with
your wages. 15 As the people waited,
and all men mused in their heartes of
Iohn, if he were not that Christ, 16 Iohn
answered, and saide to them all, In deede
I baptize you with water, but one stronger
then I, commeth, whose shoes latchet
I am not worthy to vnloose: hee will
baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with
fire. 17 Whose fanne is in his hande,
and hee will make cleane his floore, and
will gather the wheate into his garner,
but the chaffe will hee burne vp with
fire that neuer shalbe quenched. 18 Thus
then exhorting with many other things,
he preached vnto the people. 19 But when
Herod the Tetrarch was rebuked of him,
for Herodias his brother Philips wife, and
for all the euils which Herod had done,
20 He added yet this aboue all, that he
shut vp Iohn in prison. 21 Nowe it came
to passe, as all the people were baptized,
and that Iesus was baptized and did pray,
that the heauen was opened: 22 And the
holy Ghost came downe in a bodily shape
like a doue, vpon him, and there was
a voyce from heauen, saying, Thou art
my beloued Sonne: in thee I am well
pleased. 23 And Iesus himselfe began to
bee about thirtie yeere of age, being as
men supposed the sonne of Ioseph, which
was the sonne of Eli, 24 The sonne of
Matthat, the sonne of Leui, the sonne of
Melchi, the sonne of Ianna, the sonne of
Ioseph, 25 The sonne of Mattathias, the
sonne of Amos, the sonne of Naum, the
sonne of Esli, the sonne of Nagge, 26 The

abel, the sonne of Salathiel, the sonne of
Neri, 28 The sonne of Melchi, the sonne of
Addi, the sonne of Cosam, the sonne of
Elmodam, the sonne of Er, 29 The sonne
of Iose, the sonne of Eliezer, the sonne of
Iorim, the sonne of Matthat, the son of
Leui, 30 The sonne of Simeon, the sonne

1 And Iesus full of the holy Ghost re-
turned from Iordan, and was led by that
Spirit into the wildernes, 2 And was there
fourtie dayes tempted of the deuil, and
in those dayes he did eate nothing: but
when they were ended, he afterward was
hungry. 3 Then the deuil saide vnto him,
If thou be the Sonne of God, commaund
this stone that it be made bread. 4 But
Iesus answered him, saying, It is written,
That man shall not liue by bread only, but
by euery word of God. 5 Then the deuill
tooke him vp into an high mountaine,
and shewed him all the kingdomes of
the world, in the twinkeling of an eye.
6 And the deuill saide vnto him, All this
power will I giue thee, and the glory ofLuke 4:7
891
those kingdomes: for that is deliuered
to mee: and to whomsoeuer I will, I
giue it. 7 If thou therefore wilt worship
mee, they shalbe all thine. 8 But Iesus
answered him, and saide, Hence from
mee, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and him alone
thou shalt serue. 9 Then hee brought him
to Hierusalem, and set him on a pinacle
of the Temple, and said vnto him, If thou
be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe
from hence, 10 For it is written, That hee
will giue his Angels charge ouer thee to
keepe thee: 11 And with their handes they
shall lift thee vp, least at any time thou
shouldest dash thy foote against a stone.
12 And Iesus answered, and said vnto him,
It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
thy God. 13 And when the deuil had ended
all the tentation, he departed from him
for a litle season. 14 And Iesus returned by
the power of the spirite into Galile: and
there went a fame of him throughout all
the region round about. 15 For he taught
in their Synagogues, and was honoured
of all men. 16 And hee came to Nazareth
where hee had bene brought vp, and (as
his custome was) went into the Synagogue
on the Sabbath day, and stoode vp to
reade. 17 And there was deliuered vnto
him the booke of the Prophet Esaias: and
when hee had opened the booke, hee
founde the place, where it was written,
18 The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, be-
cause he hath anoynted me, that I should
preach the Gospel to the poore: he hath
sent mee, that I should heale the broken
hearted, that I should preach deliuerance
to the captiues, and recouering of sight
to the blinde, that I should set at libertie
them that are bruised: 19 And that I
should preache the acceptable yeere of
the Lord. 20 And hee closed the booke,
and gaue it againe to the minister, and
sate downe: and the eyes of all that
were in the Synagogue were fastened on
him. 21 Then he began to say vnto them,
This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your
eares. 22 And all bare him witnes, and
wondered at the gracious wordes, which
proceeded out of his mouth, and said,
Luke 4:38
Is not this Iosephs sonne? 23 Then he
said vnto them, Ye will surely say vnto
mee this prouerbe, Physician, heale thy
selfe: whatsoeuer we haue heard done in
Capernaum, doe it here likewise in thine
owne countrey. 24 And he saide, Verely
I say vnto you, No Prophet is accepted
25 But I tell
in his owne countrey.
you of a trueth, many widowes were in
Israel in the dayes of Elias, when heauen
was shut three yeres and sixe moneths,
when great famine was throughout all
the land: 26 But vnto none of them was
Elias sent, saue into Sarepta, a citie of
Sidon, vnto a certaine widowe. 27 Also
many lepers were in Israel, in the time of
Eliseus the Prophet: yet none of them was
made cleane, sauing Naaman the Syrian.
28 Then all that were in the Synagogue,
when they heard it, were filled with
wrath, 29 And rose vp, and thrust him out
of the citie, and led him vnto the edge
of the hil, whereon their citie was built,
to cast him downe headlong. 30 But he
passed through the middes of them, and
went his way, 31 And came downe into
Capernaum a citie of Galile, and there
taught them on the Sabbath dayes. 32 And
they were astonied at his doctrine: for
his worde was with authoritie. 33 And
in the Synagogue there was a man which
had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, which
cryed with a loude voyce, 34 Saying, Oh,
what haue we to doe with thee, thou
Iesus of Nazareth? art thou come to
destroy vs? I know who thou art, euen
the holy one of God. 35 And Iesus rebuked
him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come
out of him. Then the deuill throwing
him in the middes of them, came out of
him, and hurt him nothing at all. 36 So
feare came on them all, and they spake
among themselues, saying, What thing
is this: for with authoritie and power
he commaundeth the foule spirits, and
they come out? 37 And ye fame of him
spred abroad throughout all the places
of the countrey round about. 38 And he
rose vp, and came out of the Synagogue,
and entred into Simons house.
And
Simons wiues mother was taken with aLuke 4:39
892
great feuer, and they required him for
her. 39 Then he stoode ouer her, and
rebuked the feuer, and it left her, and
immediatly she arose, and ministred vnto
them. 40 Now at the sunne setting, all they
that had sicke folkes of diuers diseases,
brought them vnto him, and he layd his
hands on euery one of them, and healed
them. 41 And deuils also came out of
many, crying, and saying, Thou art that
Christ that Sonne of God: but he rebuked
them, and suffered them not to say that
they knewe him to be that Christ. 42 And
when it was day, he departed, and went
foorth into a desart place, and the people
sought him, and came to him, and kept
him that he should not depart from them.
43 But he sayd vnto them, Surely I must
also preach the kingdome of God to other
cities: for therefore am I sent. 44 And hee
preached in the Synagogues of Galile.
5
1 Then it came to passe, as the people
preassed vpon him to heare the word
of God, that he stoode by the lake of
Gennesaret, 2 And sawe two shippes stand
by the lakes side, but the fishermen were
gone out of them, and were washing their
nettes. 3 And he entred into one of the
ships, which was Simons, and required
him that he would thrust off a litle from
the land: and he sate downe, and taught
the people out of the ship. 4 Now when
he had left speaking, he sayd vnto Simon,
Lanch out into the deepe, and let downe
your nettes to make a draught. 5 Then
Simon answered, and sayd vnto him,
Master, we haue trauailed sore all night,
and haue taken nothing: neuerthelesse at
thy worde I will let downe the net. 6 And
when they had so done, they enclosed
a great multitude of fishes, so that their
net brake. 7 And they beckened to their
parteners, which were in the other ship,
that they shoulde come and helpe them,
who came then, and filled both the ships,
that they did sinke. 8 Now when Simon
Peter saw it, he fel down at Iesus knees,
saying, Lord, go from me: for I am a
sinfull man. 9 For he was vtterly astonied,
Luke 5:23
and all that were with him, for the
draught of fishes which they tooke. 10 And
so was also Iames and Iohn the sonnes of
Zebedeus, which were companions with
Simon. Then Iesus sayde vnto Simon,
Feare not: from henceforth thou shalt
catch men. 11 And when they had brought
the ships to land, they forsooke all, and
followed him. 12 Nowe it came to passe,
as he was in a certaine citie, beholde,
there was a man full of leprosie, and
when he sawe Iesus, he fell on his face,
and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou
wilt, thou canst make me cleane. 13 So
he stretched forth his hand, and touched
him, saying, I will, be thou cleane. And
immediately the leprosie departed from
him. 14 And he commanded him that
hee should tell it no man: but Go, sayth
he, and shew thy selfe to the Priest, and
offer for thy clensing, as Moses hath com-
manded, for a witnes vnto them. 15 But so
much more went there a fame abroad of
him, and great multitudes came together
to heare, and to be healed of him of their
infirmities. 16 But he kept himselfe apart
in the wildernes, and prayed. 17 And
it came to passe, on a certaine day, as
he was teaching, that the Pharises and
doctours of the Law sate by, which were
come out of euery towne of Galile, and
Iudea, and Hierusalem, and the power
of the Lord was in him to heale them.
18 Then beholde, men brought a man lying
in a bed, which was taken with a palsie,
and they sought meanes to bring him
in, and to lay him before him. 19 And
when they could not finde by what way
they might bring him in, because of the
preasse, they went vp on the house,
and let him downe through the tyling,
bed and all, in the middes before Iesus.
20 And when he sawe their faith, he sayd
vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee. 21 Then the Scribes and the Pharises
began to reason, saying, Who is this that
speaketh blasphemies? who can forgiue
sinnes, but God onely? 22 But when Iesus
perceiued their reasoning, he answered,
and sayd vnto them, What reason ye
in your hearts? 23 Whether is easier
to say, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, orLuke 5:24
893
to say, Rise and walke? 24 But that ye
may know that that Sonne of man hath
authoritie to forgiue sinnes in earth, (he
sayd vnto the sicke of the palsie) I say to
thee, Arise: take vp thy bed, and goe to
thine house. 25 And immediatly he rose
vp before them, and tooke vp his bed
whereon he lay, and departed to his owne
house, praysing God. 26 And they were
all amased, and praysed God, and were
filled with feare, saying, Doutlesse we
haue seene strange things to day. 27 And
after that, he went foorth and sawe a Pub-
licane named Leui, sitting at the receite of
custome, and sayd vnto him, Follow me.
28 And he left all, rose vp, and folowed
him. 29 Then Leui made him a great feast
in his owne house, where there was a
great company of Publicanes, and of other
that sate at table with them. 30 But they
that were Scribes and Pharises among
them, murmured against his disciples,
saying, Why eate ye and drinke ye with
Publicanes and sinners? 31 Then Iesus
answered, and sayd vnto them, They that
are whole, neede not the Physician, but
they that are sicke. 32 I came not to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
33 Then they said vnto him, Why do the
disciples of Iohn fast often, and pray,
and the disciples of the Pharises also, but
thine eate and drinke? 34 And he said vnto
them, Can ye make the children of the
wedding chamber to fast, as long as the
bridegrome is with them? 35 But the dayes
will come, euen when the bridegrome
shalbe taken away from them: then shall
they fast in those dayes. 36 Againe he
spake also vnto them a parable, No man
putteth a piece of a newe garment into an
olde vesture: for then the newe renteth
it, and the piece taken out of the newe,
agreeth not with the olde. 37 Also no man
powreth newe wine into olde vessels: for
then ye new wine wil breake the vessels,
and it will runne out, and the vessels will
perish: 38 But newe wine must be powred
into newe vessels: so both are preserued.
39 Also no man that drinketh olde wine,
straightway desireth newe: for he sayth,
The olde is more profitable.
Luke 6:16

And it came to passe on a sec-
ond solemne Sabbath, that hee went
through the corne fieldes, and his disci-
ples plucked the eares of corne, and did
eate, and rub them in their hands. 2 And
certaine of the Pharises sayde vnto them,
Why doe ye that which is not lawfull
to doe on the Sabbath dayes? 3 Then
Iesus answered them, and said, Haue ye
not read this, that Dauid did when he
himselfe was an hungred, and they which
were with him, 4 Howe he went into the
house of God, and tooke, and ate the
shewbread, and gaue also to them which
were with him, which was not lawful to
eate, but for the Priests onely? 5 And
he sayd vnto them, The Sonne of man is
Lord also of the Sabbath day. 6 It came to
passe also on another Sabbath, that hee
entred into the Synagogue, and taught,
and there was a man, whose right hand
was dryed vp. 7 And the Scribes and
Pharises watched him, whether he would
heale on the Sabbath day, that they might
finde an accusation against him. 8 But he
knew their thoughts, and sayd to the man
which had the withered hand, Arise, and
stand vp in the middes. And hee arose,
and stoode vp. 9 Then sayd Iesus vnto
them, I will aske you a question, Whether
is it lawfull on the Sabbath dayes to doe
good, or to doe euill? to saue life, or to
destroy? 10 And he behelde them all in
compasse, and sayd vnto the man, Stretch
forth thine hand. And he did so, and
his hand was restored againe, as whole
as the other. 11 Then they were filled
full of madnes, and communed one with
another, what they might doe to Iesus.
12 And it came to passe in those dayes,
that he went into a mountaine to praye,
and spent the night in prayer to God.
13 And when it was day, he called his
disciples, and of them he chose twelue
which also he called Apostles. 14 (Simon
whome he named also Peter, and Andrew
his brother, Iames and Iohn, Philippe and
Bartlemewe: 15 Matthewe and Thomas:
Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon
called Zelous, 16 Iudas Iames brother,
1Luke 6:17
894
and Iudas Iscariot, which also was the
traitour.) 17 Then he came downe with
them, and stood in a plaine place, with
the company of his disciples, and a great
multitude of people out of all Iudea, and
Hierusalem, and from the sea coast of
Tyrus and Sidon, which came to heare
him, and to be healed of their diseases:
18 And they that were vexed with foule
spirits, and they were healed. 19 And the
whole multitude sought to touch him: for
there went vertue out of him, and healed
them all. 20 And hee lifted vp his eyes
vpon his disciples, and sayd, Blessed be
ye poore: for yours is the kingdome of
God. 21 Blessed are ye that hunger nowe:
for ye shalbe satisfied: blessed are ye that
weepe now: for ye shall laugh. 22 Blessed
are ye when men hate you, and when
they separate you, and reuile you, and
put out your name as euill, for the Sonne
of mans sake. 23 Reioyce ye in that day,
and be glad: for beholde, your reward
is great in heauen: for after this maner
their fathers did to the Prophets. 24 But
wo be to you that are rich: for ye haue
receiued your consolation. 25 Wo be to
you that are full: for ye shall hunger. Wo
be to you that now laugh: for ye shall
wayle and weepe. 26 Wo be to you when
all men speake well of you: for so did
their fathers to the false prophets. 27 But
I say vnto you which heare, Loue your
enemies: doe well to them which hate
you. 28 Blesse them that curse you, and
pray for them which hurt you. 29 And
vnto him that smiteth thee on ye one
cheeke, offer also the other: and him that
taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take
thy coate also. 30 Giue to euery man that
asketh of thee: and of him that taketh
away the things that be thine, aske them
not againe. 31 And as ye would that men
should doe to you, so doe ye to them
likewise. 32 For if yee loue them which
loue you, what thanke shall ye haue?
for euen the sinners loue those that loue
them. 33 And if ye do good for them
which do good for you, what thanke shall
ye haue? for euen the sinners doe the
same. 34 And if ye lend to them of whom
Luke 6:48
ye hope to receiue, what thanke shall
yee haue? for euen the sinners lend to
sinners, to receiue the like. 35 Wherefore
loue ye your enemies, and doe good, and
lend, looking for nothing againe, and your
rewarde shalbe great, and ye shalbe the
children of the most High: for he is kinde
vnto the vnkinde, and to the euill. 36 Be ye
therefore mercifull, as your Father also is
mercifull. 37 Iudge not, and ye shall not be
iudged: condemne not, and ye shall not
bee condemned: forgiue, and ye shalbe
forgiuen. 38 Giue, and it shalbe giuen vnto
you: a good measure, pressed downe,
shaken together and running ouer shall
men giue into your bosome: for with
what measure ye mete, with the same
shall men mete to you againe. 39 And
he spake a parable vnto them, Can the
blinde leade the blinde? shall they not
both fall into the ditche? 40 The disciple
is not aboue his master: but whosoeuer
will be a perfect disciple, shall bee as
his master. 41 And why seest thou a
mote in thy brothers eye, and considerest
not the beame that is in thine owne
eye? 42 Either howe canst thou say to
thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the
mote that is in thine eye, when thou seest
not the beame that is in thine owne eye?
Hypocrite, cast out the beame out of thine
owne eye first, and then shalt thou see,
perfectly to pull out the mote that is in thy
brothers eye. 43 For it is not a good tree
that bringeth foorth euill fruite: neither
an euill tree, that bringeth foorth good
fruite. 44 For euery tree is knowen by
his owne fruite: for neither of thornes
gather men figges, nor of bushes gather
they grapes. 45 A good man out of the
good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth
good, and an euill man out of the euill
treasure of his heart bringeth foorth euill:
for of the aboundance of the heart his
mouth speaketh. 46 But why call ye me
Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I
speake? 47 Whosoeuer commeth to mee,
and heareth my wordes, and doeth the
same, I will shewe you to whome he is
like: 48 He is like a man which built
an house, and digged deepe, and laydeLuke 6:49
895
the fundation on a rocke: and when the
waters arose, the flood beat vpon that
house, and coulde not shake it: for it was
grounded vpon a rocke. 49 But hee that
heareth and doeth not, is like a man that
built an house vpon the earth without
foundation, against which the flood did
beate, and it fell by and by: and the fall
of that house was great.
7
1 When hee had ended all his sayings in
the audience of the people, he entred into
Capernaum. 2 And a certaine Ceturions
seruant was sicke and readie to die, which
was deare vnto him. 3 And when he
heard of Iesus, hee sent vnto him the
Elders of the Iewes, beseeching him that
he would come, and heale his seruant.
4 So they came to Iesus, and besought him
instantly, saying that hee was worthy that
hee should doe this for him: 5 For he
loueth, said they, our nation, and he hath
built vs a Synagogue. 6 Then Iesus went
with them: but when he was now not
farre from the house, the Centurion sent
friendes to him, saying vnto him, Lord,
trouble not thy selfe: for I am not worthy
that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe:
7 Wherefore I thought not my selfe worthy
to come vnto thee: but say the word,
and my seruant shalbe whole: 8 For I
likewise am a man set vnder authoritie,
and haue vnder mee souldiers, and I say
vnto one, Goe, and he goeth: and to
another, Come, and hee commeth: and
to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth
it. 9 When Iesus heard these things, he
marueiled at him, and turned him, and
said to the people, that followed him, I say
vnto you, I haue not found so great faith,
no not in Israel. 10 And when they that
were sent, turned backe to the house, they
founde the seruant that was sicke, whole.
11 And it came to passe the day after, that
he went into a citie called Nain, and many
of his disciples went with him, and a
great multitude. 12 Nowe when hee came
neere to the gate of the citie, behold, there
was a dead man caried out, who was
the onely begotten sonne of his mother,
which was a widowe, and much people
Luke 7:28
of the citie was with her. 13 And when
the Lord sawe her, he had compassion
on her, and said vnto her, Weepe not.
14 And he went and touched the coffin
(and they that bare him, stoode still) and
he said, Yong man, I say vnto thee, Arise.
15 And he that was dead, sate vp, and
began to speake, and he deliuered him to
his mother. 16 Then there came a feare on
them all, and they glorified God, saying,
A great Prophet is risen among vs, and
God hath visited his people. 17 And this
rumour of him went foorth throughout
all Iudea, and throughout all the region
round about. 18 And the disciples of Iohn
shewed him of all these things. 19 So Iohn
called vnto him two certaine men of his
disciples, and sent them to Iesus, saying,
Art thou hee that should come, or shall
we waite for another? 20 And when the
men were come vnto him, they said, Iohn
Baptist hath sent vs vnto thee, saying, Art
thou hee that should come, or shall we
waite for another? 21 And at that time,
he cured many of their sickenesses, and
plagues, and of euill spirites, and vnto
many blinde men he gaue sight freely.
22 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto
them, Goe your wayes and shewe Iohn,
what things ye haue seene and heard:
that the blinde see, the halt goe, the lepers
are cleansed, the deafe heare, the dead
are raised, and the poore receiue the
Gospel. 23 And blessed is hee, that shall
not be offended in me. 24 And when the
messengers of Iohn were departed, hee
began to speake vnto the people, of Iohn,
What went ye out into the wildernes to
see? A reede shaken with the winde?
25 But what went ye out to see? A man
clothed in soft rayment? beholde, they
which are gorgeously apparelled, and liue
delicately, are in Kings courtes. 26 But
what went ye foorth to see? A Prophet?
yea, I say to you, and greater then a
Prophet. 27 This is he of whom it is
written, Beholde, I sende my messenger
before thy face, which shall prepare thy
way before thee. 28 For I say vnto you,
there is no greater Prophet then Iohn,
among them that are begotten of women:
neuerthelesse, hee that is the least inLuke 7:29
896
the kingdome of God, is greater then
he. 29 Then all the people that heard,
and the Publicanes iustified God, being
baptized with the baptisme of Iohn. 30 But
the Pharises and the expounders of the
Law despised the counsell of God against
themselues, and were not baptized of
him. 31 And the Lord saide, Whereunto
shall I liken the men of this generation?
and what thing are they like vnto? 32 They
are like vnto litle children sitting in the
market place, and crying one to another,
and saying, We haue piped vnto you, and
ye haue not daunced: we haue mourned
to you, and ye haue not wept. 33 For
Iohn Baptist came, neither eating bread,
nor drinking wine: and ye say, He hath
the deuil. 34 The Sonne of man is come,
and eateth and drinketh: and ye say,
Beholde, a man which is a glutton, and
a drinker of wine, a friend of Publicanes
and sinners: 35 But wisdome is iustified
of all her children. 36 And one of the
Pharises desired him that hee would eate
with him: and hee went into the Pharises
house, and sate downe at table. 37 And
beholde, a woman in the citie, which
was a sinner, when she knewe that Iesus
sate at table in the Pharises house, shee
brought a boxe of oyntment. 38 And shee
stoode at his feete behinde him weeping,
and began to wash his feete with teares,
and did wipe them with the heares of her
head, and kissed his feete, and anoynted
them with the oyntment. 39 Nowe when
the Pharise which bade him, saw it, he
spake within himselfe, saying, If this man
were a Prophet, hee woulde surely haue
knowen who, and what maner of woman
this is which toucheth him: for she is a
sinner. 40 And Iesus answered, and saide
vnto him, Simon, I haue somewhat to say
vnto thee. And he said, Master, say on.
41 There was a certaine lender which had
two detters: the one ought fiue hundreth
pence, and the other fiftie: 42 When they
had nothing to pay, he forgaue them
both: Which of them therefore, tell mee,
will loue him most? 43 Simon answered,
and said, I suppose that he, to whom he
forgaue most. And he said vnto him, Thou
hast truely iudged. 44 Then he turned to
Luke 8:10
the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest
thou this woman? I entred into thine
house, and thou gauest mee no water to
my feete: but she hath washed my feete
with teares, and wiped them with the
heares of her head. 45 Thou gauest me no
kisse: but she, since the time I came in,
hath not ceased to kisse my feete. 46 Mine
head with oyle thou didest not anoint:
but she hath anoynted my feete with
oyntment. 47 Wherefore I say vnto thee,
many sinnes are forgiuen her: for she
loued much. To whom a litle is forgiuen,
he doeth loue a litle. 48 And he saide vnto
her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee. 49 And
they that sate at table with him, began to
say within themselues, Who is this that
euen forgiueth sinnes? 50 And he said to
the woman, Thy faith hath saued thee:
goe in peace.
8
And it came to passe afterwarde,
that hee himselfe went through euery
citie and towne, preaching and publishing
the kingdome of God, and the twelue
were with him, 2 And certaine women,
which were healed of euill spirites, and
infirmities, as Mary which was called
Magdalene, out of whom went seuen
deuils, 3 And Ioanna the wife of Chuza
Herods steward, and Susanna, and many
other which ministred vnto him of their
substance. 4 Nowe when much people
were gathered together, and were come
vnto him out of all cities, he spake by a
parable. 5 A sower went out to sowe his
seede, and as he sowed, some fell by the
wayes side, and it was troden vnder feete,
and the foules of heauen deuoured it vp.
6 And some fell on the stones, and when it
was sprong vp, it withered away, because
it lacked moystnesse. 7 And some fell
among thornes, and the thornes sprang
vp with it, and choked it. 8 And some
fell on good ground, and sprang vp, and
bare fruite, an hundreth folde. And as hee
sayd these things, he cryed, He that hath
eares to heare, let him heare. 9 Then his
disciples asked him, demaunding what
parable that was. 10 And he sayd, Vnto
1Luke 8:11
897
you it is giuen to know the secrets of ye
kingdome of God, but to other in parables,
that when they see, they shoulde not see,
and when they heare, they should not
vnderstand. 11 The parable is this, The
seede is the worde of God. 12 And they
that are beside the way, are they that
heare: afterward commeth the deuill,
and taketh away the worde out of their
hearts, least they should beleeue, and be
saued. 13 But they that are on the stones,
are they which when they haue heard,
receiue ye word with ioy: but they haue
no rootes: which for a while beleeue,
but in the time of tentation goe away.
14 And that which fell among thornes, are
they which haue heard, and after their
departure are choked with cares and with
riches, and voluptuous liuing, and bring
forth no fruite. 15 But that which fell
in good ground, are they which with an
honest and good heart heare the worde,
and keepe it, and bring forth fruite with
patience. 16 No man when he hath lighted
a candle, couereth it vnder a vessell,
neither putteth it vnder the bed, but
setteth it on a candlesticke, that they that
enter in, may see the light. 17 For nothing
is secret, that shall not be euident: neither
any thing hid, that shall not be knowen,
and come to light. 18 Take heede therefore
how ye heare: for whosoeuer hath, to
him shall be giuen: and whosoeuer hath
not, from him shalbe taken euen that
which it seemeth that he hath. 19 Then
came to him his mother and his brethren,
and could not come neere to him for
the preasse. 20 And it was tolde him by
certaine which said, Thy mother and thy
brethren stand without, and would see
thee. 21 But he answered, and sayd vnto
them, My mother and my brethren are
these which heare the worde of God, and
doe it. 22 And it came to passe on a
certaine day, that he went into a ship with
his disciples, and he sayd vnto them, Let
vs goe ouer vnto the other side of the lake.
And they lanched forth. 23 And as they
sayled, he fell a sleepe, and there came
downe a storme of winde on the lake,
and they were filled with water, and were
Luke 8:37
in ieopardie. 24 Then they went to him,
and awoke him, saying, Master, Master,
we perish. And he arose, and rebuked
the winde, and the waues of water: and
they ceased, and it was calme. 25 Then
he sayde vnto them, Where is your fayth?
and they feared, and wondered among
them selues, saying, Who is this that
commandeth both the windes and water,
and they obey him! 26 So they sailed vnto
the region of the Gadarenes, which is ouer
against Galile. 27 And as he went out
to land, there met him a certaine man
out of the citie, which had deuils long
time, and he ware no garment, neither
abode in house, but in the graues. 28 And
when he sawe Iesus, he cryed out and
fell downe before him, and with a loude
voyce sayd, What haue I to doe with thee,
Iesus the Sonne of God the most High? I
beseech thee torment me not. 29 For he
commanded ye foule spirit to come out of
the man: (for oft times he had caught him:
therefore he was bound with chaines,
and kept in fetters: but he brake the
bands, and was caried of the deuill into
wildernesses.) 30 Then Iesus asked him,
saying, What is thy name? and he sayd,
Legion, because many deuils were entred
into him. 31 And they besought him, that
he would not commaund them to goe out
into the deepe. 32 And there was there
by, an hearde of many swine, feeding on
an hill: and the deuils besought him, that
he would suffer them to enter into them.
So he suffered them. 33 Then went the
deuils out of the man, and entred into the
swine: and the hearde was caried with
violence from a steepe downe place into
the lake, and was choked. 34 When the
heardmen sawe what was done, they fled:
and when they were departed, they tolde
it in the citie and in the countrey. 35 Then
they came out to see what was done, and
came to Iesus, and found the man, out of
whom the deuils were departed, sitting at
the feete of Iesus, clothed, and in his right
minde: and they were afrayd. 36 They also
which saw it, tolde them by what meanes
he that was possessed with the deuill,
was healed. 37 Then the whole multitude
of the countrey about the Gadarenes,Luke 8:38
898
besought him that he would depart from
them: for they were taken with a great
feare: and he went into the ship, and
returned. 38 Then the man, out of whome
the deuils were departed, besought him
that hee might be with him: but Iesus
sent him away, saying, 39 Returne into
thine owne house, and shewe what great
things God hath done to thee. So hee
went his way, and preached throughout
all the citie, what great things Iesus had
done vnto him. 40 And it came to passe,
when Iesus was come againe, that the
people receiued him: for they all waited
for him. 41 And beholde, there came a
man named Iairus, and he was the ruler
of the Synagogue, who fell downe at Iesus
feete, and besought him that he would
come into his house. 42 For he had but
a daughter onely, about twelue yeeres of
age, and she lay a dying (and as he went,
the people thronged him. 43 And a woman
hauing an yssue of blood, twelue yeeres
long, which had spent all her substance
vpon physicians, and could not be healed
of any: 44 When she came behind him, she
touched the hemme of his garment, and
immediatly her yssue of blood stanched.
45 Then Iesus sayd, Who is it that hath
touched me? When euery man denied,
Peter sayd and they that were with him,
Master, the multitude thrust thee, and
tread on thee, and sayest thou, Who hath
touched me? 46 And Iesus sayde, Some
one hath touched me: for I perceiue that
vertue is gone out of me. 47 When the
woman sawe that she was not hid, she
came trembling, and fell downe before
him, and tolde him before all the people,
for what cause she had touched him, and
how she was healed immediatly. 48 And
he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good
comfort: thy faith hath saued thee: go in
peace.) 49 While he yet spake, there came
one from the ruler of the Synagogues
house, which sayde to him, Thy daughter
is dead: disease not the Master. 50 When
Iesus heard it, he answered him, saying,
Feare not: beleeue onely, and she shall
be saued. 51 And when he went into the
house, he suffered no man to goe in with
Luke 9:12
him, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn,
and the father and mother of the maide.
52 And all wept, and sorowed for her: but
he sayd, Weepe not: for she is not dead,
but sleepeth. 53 And they laught him to
scorne, knowing that she was dead. 54 So
he thrust them all out, and tooke her by
the hand, and cryed, saying, Maide, arise.
55 And her spirite came againe, and she
rose straightway: and he comanded to
giue her meate. 56 Then her parents were
astonied: but hee commanded them that
they should tell no man what was done.
9
1 Then called hee his twelue disciples to-
gether, and gaue them power and author-
itie ouer all deuils, and to heale diseases.
2 And hee sent them foorth to preach the
kingdome of God, and to cure the sicke.
3 And he sayd to them, Take nothing to
your iourney, neither staues, nor scrip,
neither bread, nor siluer, neither haue
two coates apiece. 4 And whatsoeuer
house ye enter into, there abide, and
thence depart. 5 And howe many so euer
will not receiue you, when ye goe out of
that citie, shake off the very dust from
your feete for a testimonie against them.
6 And they went out, and went through
euery towne preaching the Gospel, and
healing euery where. 7 Nowe Herod the
Tetrarch heard of all that was done by
him: and he douted, because that it was
sayd of some, that Iohn was risen againe
from the dead: 8 And of some, that Elias
had appeared: and of some, that one
of the olde Prophets was risen againe.
9 Then Herod sayd, Iohn haue I beheaded:
who then is this of whome I heare such
things? and he desired to see him. 10 And
when the Apostles returned, they tolde
him what great things they had done.
Then he tooke them to him, and went
aside into a solitarie place, neere to the
citie called Bethsaida. 11 But when the
people knewe it, they followed him: and
he receiued them, and spake vnto them
of the kingdome of God, and healed them
that had neede to be healed. 12 And
when the day began to weare away, theLuke 9:13
899
twelue came, and sayd vnto him, Sende
the people away, that they may goe into
the townes and villages round about, and
lodge, and get meate: for we are here
in a desart place. 13 But he sayd vnto
them, Giue ye them to eate. And they
sayd, We haue no more but fiue loaues
and two fishes, except we should go and
buy meate for all this people. 14 For they
were about fiue thousand men. Then he
sayde to his disciples, Cause them to sit
downe by fifties in a company. 15 And
they did so, and caused all to sit downe.
16 Then he tooke the fiue loaues, and
the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen,
and blessed them, and brake, and gaue
to the disciples, to set before the people.
17 So they did all eate, and were satisfied:
and there was taken vp of that remained
to them, twelue baskets full of broken
meate. 18 And it came to passe, as hee
was alone praying, his disciples were
with him: and he asked them, saying,
Whom say the people that I am? 19 They
answered, and sayd, Iohn Baptist: and
others say, Elias: and some say, that
one of the olde Prophets is risen againe.
20 And he sayd vnto them, But whom say
ye that I am? Peter answered, and sayd,
That Christ of God. 21 And he warned
and commanded them, that they should
tell that to no man, 22 Saying, The Sonne
of man must suffer many things and be
reproued of the Elders, and of the hie
Priests and Scribes, and be slaine, and
the third day rise againe. 23 And he sayd
to them all, If any man will come after
me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp
his crosse dayly, and follow me. 24 For
whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose
it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for
my sake, the same shall saue it. 25 For
what auantageth it a man, if he win the
whole worlde, and destroy himselfe, or
lose himselfe? 26 For whosoeuer shall be
ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of
him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed,
when hee shall come in his glorie, and in
the glorie of the Father, and of the holy
Angels. 27 And I tell you of a suretie,
there be some standing here, which shall
Luke 9:43
not taste of death, till they haue seene
the kingdome of God. 28 And it came to
passe about an eyght dayes after those
wordes, that he tooke Peter and Iohn, and
Iames, and went vp into a mountaine to
pray. 29 And as he prayed, the fashion
of his countenance was changed, and his
garment was white and glistered. 30 And
beholde, two men talked with him, which
were Moses and Elias: 31 Which appeared
in glory, and tolde of his departing, which
he shoulde accomplish at Hierusalem.
32 But Peter and they that were with him,
were heauie with sleepe, and when they
awoke, they saw his glorie, and the two
men standing with him. 33 And it came to
passe, as they departed from him, Peter
said vnto Iesus, Master, it is good for vs
to be here: let vs therefore make three
tabernacles, one for thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias, and wist not
what he said. 34 Whiles he thus spake,
there came a cloude and ouershadowed
them, and they feared when they were
entring into the cloude. 35 And there came
a voyce out of the cloud, saying, This is
that my beloued Sonne, heare him. 36 And
when the voyce was past, Iesus was found
alone: and they kept it close, and tolde no
man in those dayes any of those things
which they had seene. 37 And it came
to passe on the next day, as they came
downe from the mountaine, much people
met him. 38 And beholde, a man of the
companie cried out, saying, Master, I be-
seech thee, beholde my sonne: for he is all
that I haue. 39 And loe, a spirit taketh him,
and suddenly he crieth, and he teareth
him, that he fometh, and hardly departeth
from him, when he hath bruised him.
40 Nowe I haue besought thy disciples to
cast him out, but they could not. 41 Then
Iesus answered, and said, O generation
faithlesse, and crooked, howe long now
shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring
thy sonne hither. 42 And whiles he was
yet comming, the deuill rent him, and
tare him: and Iesus rebuked the vncleane
spirite, and healed the childe, and deli-
uered him to his father. 43 And they were
all amased at the mightie power of God:Luke 9:44
900
and while they all wondered at al things,
which Iesus did, he said vnto his disciples,
44 Marke these wordes diligently: for it
shall come to passe, that the Sonne of
man shalbe deliuered into the handes of
men. 45 But they vnderstood not that
word: for it was hid from them, so that
they could not perceiue it: and they
feared to aske him of that worde. 46 Then
there arose a disputation among them,
which of them should be the greatest.
47 When Iesus sawe the thoughtes of
their heartes, he tooke a litle childe, and
set him by him, 48 And said vnto them,
Whosoeuer receiueth this litle childe in
my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer
shall receiue me, receiueth him that sent
me: for he that is least among you all,
he shall be great. 49 And Iohn answered
and saide, Master, we sawe one casting
out deuils in thy Name, and we forbad
him, because he followeth thee not with
vs. 50 Then Iesus saide vnto him, Forbid
ye him not: for he that is not against vs,
is with vs. 51 And it came to passe, when
the dayes were accomplished, that he
should be receiued vp, he setled himselfe
fully to goe to Hierusalem, 52 And sent
messengers before him: and they went
and entred into a towne of the Samar-
itans, to prepare him lodging. 53 But
they woulde not receiue him, because his
behauiour was, as though he would go to
Hierusalem. 54 And when his disciples,
Iames and Iohn sawe it, they saide, Lord,
wilt thou that we commaund, that fire
come downe from heauen, and consume
them, euen as Elias did? 55 But Iesus
turned about, and rebuked them, and
said, Ye knowe not of what spirit ye are.
56 For the Sonne of man is not come to
destroy mens liues, but to saue them.
Then they went to another towne. 57 And
it came to passe that as they went in
the way, a certaine man said vnto him,
I will follow thee, Lord, whithersoeuer
thou goest. 58 And Iesus saide vnto him,
The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of
the heauen nestes, but the Sonne of man
hath not whereon to lay his head. 59 But
he said vnto another, Followe me. And
the same said, Lord, suffer me first to goe
Luke 10:13
and burie my father. 60 And Iesus said
vnto him, Let the dead burie their dead:
but go thou, and preache the kingdome of
God. 61 Then another saide, I will follow
thee, Lord: but let me first go bid them
farewell, which are at mine house. 62 And
Iesus saide vnto him, No man that putteth
his hand to the plough, and looketh backe,
is apt to the kingdome of God.
10
After these thinges, the Lord ap-
pointed other seuentie also, and sent
them, two and two before him into eu-
ery citie and place, whither he himselfe
should come. 2 And he said vnto them,
The haruest is great, but the labourers
are fewe: pray therefore the Lord of the
haruest to sende foorth labourers into his
haruest. 3 Goe your wayes: beholde, I
send you foorth as lambes among wolues.
4 Beare no bagge, neither scrippe, nor
shoes, and salute no man by the way.
5 And into whatsoeuer house ye enter,
first say, Peace be to this house. 6 And
if the sonne of peace be there, your peace
shall rest vpon him: if not, it shall turne
to you againe. 7 And in that house tary
still, eating and drinking such things as
by them shall be set before you: for the
labourer is worthy of his wages. Goe
not from house to house. 8 But into
whatsoeuer citie ye shall enter, if they
receiue you, eate such things as are set
before you, 9 And heale the sicke that are
there, and say vnto them, The kingdome
of God is come neere vnto you. 10 But
into whatsoeuer citie ye shall enter, if
they will not receiue you, goe your wayes
out into the streetes of the same, and
say, 11 Euen the very dust, which cleaueth
on vs of your citie, we wipe off against
you: notwithstanding knowe this, that
the kingdome of God was come neere
vnto you. 12 For I say to you, that it
shall be easier in that day for them of
Sodom, then for that citie. 13 Woe be
to thee, Chorazin: woe be to thee, Beth-
saida: for if the miracles had bene done
in Tyrus and Sidon, which haue bene
done in you, they had a great while agone
1Luke 10:14
repented, sitting in sackecloth and ashes.
14 Therefore it shall be easier for Tyrus,
and Sidon, at the iudgement, then for
you. 15 And thou, Capernaum, which
art exalted to heauen, shalt be thrust
downe to hell. 16 He that heareth you,
heareth me: and he that despiseth you,
despiseth me: and he that despiseth me,
despiseth him that sent me. 17 And the
seuentie turned againe with ioy, saying,
Lord, euen the deuils are subdued to vs
through thy Name. 18 And he said vnto
them, I sawe Satan, like lightening, fall
downe from heauen. 19 Beholde, I giue
vnto you power to treade on Serpents,
and Scorpions, and ouer all the power
of the enemie, and nothing shall hurt
you. 20 Neuerthelesse, in this reioyce not,
that the spirits are subdued vnto you:
but rather reioyce, because your names
are written in heauen. 21 That same
houre reioyced Iesus in the spirit, and
said, I confesse vnto thee, Father, Lord of
heauen and earth, that thou hast hid these
things from the wise and vnderstanding,
and hast reueiled them to babes: euen so,
Father, because it so pleased thee. 22 All
things are giuen me of my Father: and no
man knoweth who the Sonne is, but the
Father: neither who the Father is, saue
the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne
will reueile him. 23 And he turned to his
disciples, and said secretly, Blessed are
the eyes, which see that ye see. 24 For
I tell you that many Prophets and Kings
haue desired to see those things, which
ye see, and haue not seene them: and to
heare those things which ye heare, and
haue not heard them. 25 Then beholde, a
certaine Lawyer stoode vp, and tempted
him, saying, Master, what shall I doe, to
inherite eternall life? 26 And he saide vnto
him, What is written in the Lawe? howe
readest thou? 27 And he answered, and
saide, Thou shalt loue thy Lord God with
all thine heart, and with all thy soule,
and with all thy strength, and with all
thy thought, and thy neighbour as thy
selfe. 28 Then he said vnto him, Thou
hast answered right: this doe, and thou
shalt liue. 29 But he willing to iustifie
901
Luke 11:1
himselfe, said vnto Iesus, Who is then my
neighbour? 30 And Iesus answered, and
saide, A certaine man went downe from
Hierusalem to Iericho, and fell among
theeues, and they robbed him of his rai-
ment, and wounded him, and departed,
leauing him halfe dead. 31 Nowe so it
fell out, that there came downe a certaine
Priest that same way, and when he sawe
him, he passed by on the other side.
32 And likewise also a Leuite, when he
was come neere to the place, went and
looked on him, and passed by on the other
side. 33 Then a certaine Samaritane, as
he iourneyed, came neere vnto him, and
when he sawe him, he had compassion
on him, 34 And went to him, and bound
vp his wounds, and powred in oyle and
wine, and put him on his owne beast, and
brought him to an Inne, and made proui-
sion for him. 35 And on the morowe when
he departed, he tooke out two pence, and
gaue them to the hoste, and said vnto
him, Take care of him, and whatsoeuer
thou spendest more, when I come againe,
I will recompense thee. 36 Which nowe of
these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour
vnto him that fell among the theeues?
37 And he saide, He that shewed mercie
on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe,
and do thou likewise. 38 Nowe it came to
passe, as they went, that he entred into
a certaine towne, and a certaine woman
named Martha, receiued him into her
house. 39 And she had a sister called
Marie, which also sate at Iesus feete, and
heard his preaching. 40 But Martha was
combred about much seruing, and came
to him, and saide, Master, doest thou not
care that my sister hath left me to serue
alone? bid her therefore, that she helpe
me. 41 And Iesus answered, and said vnto
her, Martha, Martha, thou carest, and art
troubled about many things: 42 But one
thing is needefull, Marie hath chosen the
good part, which shall not be taken away
from her.
11
1 And so it was, that as he was praying
in a certaine place, when he ceased,
one of his disciples said vnto him, Lord,Luke 11:2
902
teache vs to pray, as Iohn also taught his
disciples. 2 And he said vnto them, When
ye pray, say, Our Father, which art in
heauen, halowed be thy Name: Thy king-
dome come: Let thy will be done, euen in
earth, as it is in heauen: 3 Our dayly bread
giue vs for the day: 4 And forgiue vs our
sinnes: for euen we forgiue euery man
that is indetted to vs: And leade vs not
into temptation: but deliuer vs from euill.
5 Moreouer he said vnto them, Which of
you shall haue a friende, and shall goe
to him at midnight, and say vnto him,
Friende, lende mee three loaues? 6 For
a friende of mine is come out of the way
to me, and I haue nothing to set before
him: 7 And hee within shoulde answere,
and say, Trouble mee not: the doore is
nowe shut, and my children are with mee
in bed: I can not rise and giue them
to thee. 8 I say vnto you, Though he
would not arise and giue him, because
he is his friende, yet doubtlesse because
of his importunitie, hee woulde rise, and
giue him as many as he needed. 9 And I
say vnto you, Aske, and it shall be giuen
you: seeke, and yee shall finde: knocke,
and it shalbe opened vnto you. 10 For
euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he
that seeketh, findeth: and to him that
knocketh, it shalbe opened. 11 If a sonne
shall aske bread of any of you that is a
father, will he giue him a stone? or if hee
aske a fish, will he for a fish giue him a
serpent? 12 Or if hee aske an egge, will
hee giue him a scorpion? 13 If yee then
which are euill, can giue good giftes vnto
your children, howe much more shall
your heauenly Father giue the holy Ghost
to them, that desire him? 14 Then hee
cast out a deuill which was domme: and
when the deuill was gone out, the domme
spake, and the people wondered. 15 But
some of them said, He casteth out deuils
through Beelzebub the chiefe of ye deuils.
16 And others tempted him, seeking of him
a signe from heauen. 17 But he knew
their thoughts, and said vnto them, Euery
kingdom deuided against it self, shall be
desolate, and an house deuided against
an house, falleth. 18 So if Satan also
Luke 11:32
bee deuided against himselfe, howe shall
his kingdome stande, because yee say
that I cast out deuils through Beelzebub?
19 If I through Beelzebub cast out deuils,
by whome doe your children cast them
out? Therefore shall they be your iudges.
20 But if I by ye finger of God cast out
deuils, doutles the kingdome of God is
come vnto you. 21 When a strong man
armed keepeth his palace, the thinges that
hee possesseth, are in peace. 22 But when
a stronger then hee, commeth vpon him,
and ouercommeth him: hee taketh from
him all his armour wherein he trusted,
and deuideth his spoiles. 23 He that is not
with me, is against me: and he that gath-
ereth not with me, scattereth. 24 When the
vncleane spirite is gone out of a man, he
walketh through drie places, seeking rest:
and when he findeth none he saieth, I wil
returne vnto mine house whence I came
out. 25 And when he cometh, he findeth it
swept and garnished. 26 Then goeth hee,
and taketh to him seuen other spirites
worse then himselfe: and they enter in,
and dwel there: so the last state of that
man is worse then the first. 27 And it
came to passe as he sayde these thinges, a
certaine woman of the companie lifted vp
her voyce, and sayde vnto him, Blessed is
the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes
which thou hast sucked. 28 But hee saide,
Yea, rather blessed are they that heare
the woorde of God, and keepe it. 29 And
when the people were gathered thicke
together, he began to say, This is a wicked
generation: they seeke a signe, and there
shall no signe be giuen them, but the
signe of Ionas the Prophet. 30 For as Ionas
was a signe to the Niniuites: so shall also
the Sonne of man bee to this generation.
31 The Queene of the South shall rise in
iudgement, with the men of this gen-
eration, and shall condemne them: for
shee came from the vtmost partes of the
earth to heare the wisedome of Salomon,
and beholde, a greater then Salomon is
here. 32 The men of Niniue shall rise
in iudgement with this generation, and
shall condemne it: for they repented at
the preaching of Ionas: and beholde, aLuke 11:33
greater then Ionas is here. 33 No man
when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it
in a priuie place, neither vnder a bushell:
but on a candlesticke, that they which
come in, may see the light. 34 The light of
the bodie is the eye: therefore when thine
eye is single, then is thy whole bodie light:
but if thine eye be euill, then thy bodie is
darke. 35 Take heede therefore, that the
light which is in thee, be not darkenesse.
36 If therefore thy whole body shall be
light, hauing no part darke, then shall all
be light, euen as when a candle doth light
thee with the brightnesse. 37 And as hee
spake, a certaine Pharise besought him
to dine with him: and hee went in, and
sate downe at table. 38 And when the
Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had
not first washed before dinner. 39 And the
Lord saide to him, In deede yee Pharises
make cleane the outside of the cuppe, and
of the platter: but the inwarde part is
full of rauening and wickednesse. 40 Ye
fooles, did not he that made that which
is without, make that which is within
also? 41 Therefore, giue almes of those
thinges which you haue, and beholde, all
thinges shall be cleane to you. 42 But
wo be to you, Pharises: for ye tithe the
mynt and the rewe, and all maner herbs,
and passe ouer iudgement and the loue
of God: these ought yee to haue done,
and not to haue left the other vndone.
43 Wo be to you, Pharises: for ye loue the
vppermost seats in the Synagogues, and
greetings in the markets. 44 Wo be to you,
Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye
are as graues which appeare not, and the
men that walke ouer them, perceiue not.
45 Then answered one of the Lawyers,
and saide vnto him, Master, thus saying
thou puttest vs to rebuke also. 46 And he
sayde, Wo be to you also, yee Lawyers:
for yee lade men with burdens grieuous
to be borne, and yee your selues touche
not the burdens with one of your fingers.
47 Wo be to you:
for ye builde the
sepulchres of the Prophetes, and your
fathers killed them. 48 Truely ye beare
witnesse, and allowe the deedes of your
fathers: for they killed them, and yee
903
Luke 12:9
build their sepulchres. 49 Therefore said
the wisedome of God, I wil sende them
Prophets and Apostles, and of them they
shall slaie, and persecute away, 50 That
the blood of all the Prophets, shed from
the foundation of the world, may be
required of this generation, 51 From the
blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias,
which was slaine betweene the altar and
the Temple: verely I say vnto you, it shall
be required of this generation. 52 Wo be to
you, Lawyers: for ye haue taken away the
key of knowledge: ye entred not in your
selues, and them that came in, ye forbade.
53 And as he sayde these things vnto them,
the Scribes and Pharises began to vrge
him sore, and to prouoke him to speake
of many things, 54 Laying wait for him,
and seeking to catche some thing of his
mouth, whereby they might accuse him.
12
1 In the meane time, there gathered to-
gether an innumerable multitude of peo-
ple, so that they trode one another: and
he began to say vnto his disciples first,
Take heede to your selues of the leauen
of the Pharises, which is hypocrisie. 2 For
there is nothing couered, that shall not
bee reueiled: neither hidde, that shall
not be knowen. 3 Wherefore whatsoeuer
yee haue spoken in darkenesse, it shall
be heard in the light: and that which
ye haue spoken in the eare, in secret
places, shall be preached on the houses.
4 And I say vnto you, my friendes, be
not afraide of them that kill the bodie,
and after that are not able to doe any
more. 5 But I wil forewarne you, who
ye shall feare: feare him which after hee
hath killed, hath power to cast into hell:
yea, I say vnto you, him feare. 6 Are not
fiue sparowes bought for two farthings,
and yet not one of them is forgotten
before God? 7 Yea, and all the heares
of your head are nombred: feare not
therefore: yee are more of value then
many sparowes. 8 Also I say vnto you,
Whosoeuer shall confesse mee before
men, him shall the Sonne of man confesse
also before the Angels of God. 9 But heeLuke 12:10
904
that shall denie mee before men, shall be
denied before the Angels of God. 10 And
whosoeuer shall speake a woorde against
the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen
him: but vnto him, that shall blaspheme
ye holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen.
11 And when they shall bring you vnto
the Synagogues, and vnto the rulers and
Princes, take no thought howe, or what
thing ye shall answere, or what yee shall
speake. 12 For the holy Ghost shall teache
you in the same houre, what yee ought to
say. 13 And one of the companie said vnto
him, Master, bidde my brother deuide the
inheritance with me. 14 And he said vnto
him, Man, who made me a iudge, or a
deuider ouer you? 15 Wherefore he said
vnto them, Take heede, and beware of
couetousnesse: for though a man haue
abundance, yet his life standeth not in his
riches. 16 And he put foorth a parable
vnto them, saying, The grounde of a
certaine riche man brought foorth fruites
17 Therefore he thought
plenteously.
with himselfe, saying, What shall I doe,
because I haue no roume, where I may
lay vp my fruites? 18 And he said, This
wil I do, I wil pul downe my barnes, and
builde greater, and therein will I gather
all my fruites, and my goods. 19 And
I wil say to my soule, Soule, thou hast
much goods laide vp for many yeeres:
liue at ease, eate, drinke and take thy
pastime. 20 But God said vnto him, O
foole, this night wil they fetch away thy
soule from thee: then whose shall those
things be which thou hast prouided? 21 So
is he that gathereth riches to himselfe,
22 And he
and is not riche in God.
spake vnto his disciples, Therefore I say
vnto you, Take no thought for your life,
what yee shall eate: neither for your
body, what yee shall put on. 23 The
life is more then meate: and the body
more then the raiment. 24 Consider the
rauens: for they neither sowe nor reape:
which neither haue storehouse nor barne,
and yet God feedeth them: how much
more are yee better then foules? 25 And
which of you with taking thought, can
adde to his stature one cubite? 26 If yee
Luke 12:42
then bee not able to doe the least thing,
why take yee thought for the remnant?
27 Consider the lilies howe they growe:
they labour not, neither spin they: yet I
say vnto you, that Salomon himselfe in
all his royaltie was not clothed like one
of these. 28 If then God so clothe the
grasse which is to day in the field, and
to morowe is cast into the ouen, howe
much more will he clothe you, O yee of
litle faith? 29 Therefore aske not what yee
shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, neither
hag you in suspense. 30 For all such things
the people of the world seeke for: and
your Father knoweth that ye haue neede
of these things. 31 But rather seeke ye
after the kingdome of God, and all these
things shalbe cast vpon you. 32 Feare
not, litle flocke: for it is your Fathers
pleasure, to giue you the kingdome. 33 Sell
that ye haue, and giue almes: make you
bagges, which waxe not old, a treasure
that can neuer faile in heauen, where
no theefe commeth, neither mothe cor-
rupteth. 34 For where your treasure is,
there will your hearts be also. 35 Let
your loynes be gird about and your lights
burning, 36 And ye your selues like vnto
men that waite for their master, when he
will returne from the wedding, that when
he commeth and knocketh, they may
open vnto him immediatly. 37 Blessed
are those seruants, whom the Lord when
he commeth shall finde waking: verely
I say vnto you, he will girde himselfe
about, and make them to sit downe at
table, and will come forth, and serue
them. 38 And if he come in the seconde
watch, or come in the third watch, and
shall finde them so, blessed are those
seruants. 39 Nowe vnderstand this, that if
the good man of the house had knowen
at what houre the theefe would haue
come, he would haue watched, and would
not haue suffered his house to be digged
through. 40 Be ye also prepared therefore:
for the Sonne of man will come at an
houre when ye thinke not. 41 Then Peter
saide vnto him, Master, tellest thou this
parable vnto vs, or euen to all? 42 And the
Lord saide, Who is a faithfull steward and
wise, whom the master shall make rulerLuke 12:43
905
ouer his householde, to giue them their
portion of meate in season? 43 Blessed is
that seruant, whom his master when he
commeth, shall finde so doing. 44 Of a
trueth I say vnto you, that he wil make
him ruler ouer all that he hath. 45 But if
that seruant say in his heart, My master
doeth deferre his comming, and ginne
to smite the seruants, and maydens, and
to eate, and drinke, and to be drunken,
46 The master of that seruant will come
in a day when he thinketh not, and at an
houre when he is not ware of, and will
cut him off, and giue him his portion with
the vnbeleeuers. 47 And that seruant that
knewe his masters will, and prepared not
himselfe, neither did according to his will,
shalbe beaten with many stripes. 48 But
he that knewe it not, and yet did commit
things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten
with fewe stripes: for vnto whomsoeuer
much is giuen, of him shalbe much re-
quired, and to whom men much commit,
the more of him will they aske. 49 I am
come to put fire on the earth, and what
is my desire, if it be already kindled?
50 Notwithstanding I must be baptized
with a baptisme, and how am I grieued,
till it be ended? 51 Thinke ye that I
am come to giue peace on earth? I tell
you, nay, but rather debate. 52 For from
hencefoorth there shall be fiue in one
house deuided, three against two, and
two against three. 53 The father shalbe
deuided against ye sonne, and the sonne
against the father: the mother against the
daughter, and the daughter against the
mother: the mother in lawe against her
daughter in lawe, and the daughter in
lawe against her mother in lawe. 54 Then
said he to the people, When ye see a
cloude rise out of the West, straightway
ye say, A shower commeth: and so it
is. 55 And when ye see the South winde
blowe, ye say, that it wilbe hoate: and
it commeth to passe. 56 Hypocrites, ye
can discerne the face of the earth, and
of the skie: but why discerne ye not this
time? 57 Yea, and why iudge ye not of your
selues what is right? 58 While thou goest
with thine aduersarie to the ruler, as thou
Luke 13:14
art in the way, giue diligence in the way,
that thou mayest be deliuered from him,
least he drawe thee to the iudge, and the
iudge deliuer thee to the iayler, and the
iayler cast thee into prison. 59 I tell thee,
thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast
payed the vtmost mite.
13
1 There were certaine men present at
the same season, that shewed him of
the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had
mingled with their sacrifices. 2 And Iesus
answered, and saide vnto them, Suppose
ye, that these Galileans were greater sin-
ners then al the other Galileans, because
they haue suffered such things? 3 I tell
you, nay: but except ye amend your liues,
ye shall all likewise perish. 4 Or thinke
you that those eighteene, vpon whom the
tower in Siloam fell, and slewe them,
were sinners aboue all men that dwel in
Hierusalem? 5 I tell you, nay: but except
ye amend your liues, ye shall all likewise
perish. 6 He spake also this parable, A
certaine man had a figge tree planted in
his vineyard: and he came and sought
fruite thereon, and found none. 7 Then
said he to the dresser of his vineyard,
Behold, this three yeeres haue I come and
sought fruite of this figge tree, and finde
none: cut it downe: why keepeth it also
the ground barren? 8 And he answered,
and said vnto him, Lord, let it alone this
yeere also, till I digge round about it,
and doung it. 9 And if it beare fruite,
well: if not, then after thou shalt cut it
downe. 10 And he taught in one of ye
Synagogues on the Sabbath day. 11 And
behold, there was a woman which had a
spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeeres, and
was bowed together, and coulde not lift
vp her selfe in any wise. 12 When Iesus
sawe her, he called her to him, and said
to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy
disease. 13 And he laide his handes on her,
and immediately she was made straight
againe, and glorified God. 14 And the
ruler of the Synagogue answered with
indignation, because that Iesus healed
on the Sabbath day, and said vnto theLuke 13:15
people, There are sixe dayes in which
men ought to worke: in them therefore
come and be healed, and not on the
Sabbath day. 15 Then answered him the
Lord, and said, Hypocrite, doth not eche
one of you on the Sabbath day loose his
oxe or his asse from the stall, and leade
him away to the water? 16 And ought
not this daughter of Abraham, whom
Satan had bound, loe, eighteene yeeres,
be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath
day? 17 And when he said these things,
all his aduersaries were ashamed: but all
the people reioyced at all the excellent
things, that were done by him. 18 Then
said he, What is the kingdome of God
like? or whereto shall I compare it?
19 It is like a graine of mustard seede,
which a man tooke and sowed in his
garden, and it grewe, and waxed a great
tree, and the foules of the heauen made
nestes in the branches thereof. 20 And
againe he said, Whereunto shall I liken
the kingdome of God? 21 It is like leauen,
which a woman tooke, and hid in three
peckes of floure, till all was leauened.
22 And he went through all cities and
townes, teaching, and iourneying towards
Hierusalem. 23 Then saide one vnto him,
Lord, are there fewe that shalbe saued?
And he said vnto them, 24 Striue to enter
in at the straite gate: for many, I say vnto
you, will seeke to enter in, and shall not
be able. 25 When the good man of the
house is risen vp, and hath shut to the
doore, and ye begin to stand without, and
to knocke at the doore, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to vs, and he shall answere and say
vnto you, I know you not whence ye are,
26 Then shall ye begin to say, We haue
eaten and drunke in thy presence, and
thou hast taught in our streetes. 27 But
he shall say, I tell you, I knowe you not
whence ye are: depart from me, all ye
workers of iniquitie. 28 There shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye
shall see Abraham and Isaac, and Iacob,
and all the Prophets in the kingdome of
God, and your selues thrust out at doores.
29 Then shall come many from the East,
and from the West, and from the North,
906
Luke 14:9
and from the South, and shall sit at Table
in the kingdome of God. 30 And beholde,
there are last, which shalbe first, and
there are first, which shalbe last. 31 The
same day there came certaine Pharises,
and said vnto him, Depart, and goe hence:
for Herod will kill thee. 32 Then said he
vnto them, Goe ye and tell that foxe, Be-
holde, I cast out deuils, and will heale still
to day, and to morowe, and the third day I
shalbe perfected. 33 Neuerthelesse I must
walke to day, and to morowe, and the day
following: for it cannot be that a Prophet
should perish out of Hierusalem. 34 O
Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the
Prophets, and stonest them that are sent
to thee, howe often would I haue gathered
thy children together, as the henne gath-
ereth her brood vnder her wings, and ye
would not! 35 Beholde, your house is left
vnto you desolate: and verely I tell you, ye
shall not see me vntill the time come that
ye shall say, Blessed is he that commeth
in the Name of the Lord.

1 And it came to passe that when he
was entred into the house of one of the
chiefe Pharises on the Sabbath day, to
eate bread, they watched him. 2 And
beholde, there was a certaine man before
him, which had the dropsie. 3 Then Iesus
answering, spake vnto the Lawyers and
Pharises, saying, Is it lawfull to heale on
the Sabbath day? 4 And they held their
peace. Then he tooke him, and healed
him, and let him goe, 5 And answered
them, saying, Which of you shall haue
an asse, or an oxe fallen into a pit,
and wil not straightway pull him out on
the Sabbath day? 6 And they could not
answere him againe to those things. 7 He
spake also a parable to the ghestes, when
he marked howe they chose out the chiefe
roomes, and said vnto them, 8 When thou
shalt be bidden of any man to a wedding,
set not thy selfe downe in the chiefest
place, lest a more honourable man then
thou, be bidden of him, 9 And he that bade
both him and thee, come, and say to thee,
Giue this man roome, and thou then begin
with shame to take the lowest roome.Luke 14:10
10 But when thou art bidden, goe and sit
downe in the lowest roome, that when he
that bade thee, cometh, he may say vnto
thee, Friende, sit vp hier: then shalt thou
haue worship in the presence of them that
sit at table with thee. 11 For whosoeuer
exalteth himselfe, shall be brought lowe,
and he that humbleth himselfe, shall be
exalted. 12 Then said he also to him that
had bidden him, When thou makest a
dinner or a supper, call not thy friendes,
nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsemen,
nor ye riche neighbours, lest they also
bid thee againe, and a recompence be
made thee. 13 But when thou makest
a feast, call ye poore, the maimed, the
lame, and the blind, 14 And thou shalt be
blessed, because they cannot recompense
thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at
the resurrection of the iust. 15 Nowe when
one of them that sate at table, heard these
things, he said vnto him, Blessed is he
that eateth bread in the kingdome of God.
16 Then saide he to him, A certaine man
made a great supper, and bade many,
17 And sent his seruant at supper time to
say to them that were bidden, Come: for
all things are nowe readie. 18 But they all
with one mind beganne to make excuse:
The first saide vnto him, I haue bought a
farme, and I must needes goe out and see
it: I pray thee, haue me excused. 19 And
another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of
oxen, and I goe to proue them: I pray
thee, haue me excused. 20 And another
said, I haue maried a wife, and therefore
I can not come. 21 So that seruaunt
returned, and shewed his master these
thinges. Then was the good man of the
house angrie, and said to his seruant, Goe
out quickely into the streetes and lanes of
the citie, and bring in hither the poore,
and the maimed, and the halt, and the
blinde. 22 And the seruaunt saide, Lord,
it is done as thou hast commanded, and
yet there is roome. 23 Then the master
sayd to the seruaunt, Goe out into the hie
wayes, and hedges, and compell them to
come in, that mine house may bee filled.
24 For I say vnto you, that none of those
men which were bidden, shall taste of
my supper. 25 Nowe there went great
907
Luke 15:7
multitudes with him, and he turned and
sayd vnto them, 26 If any man come to
mee, and hate not his father, and mother,
and wife, and children, and brethren, and
sisters: yea, and his owne life also, he
can not be my disciple. 27 And whosoeuer
beareth not his crosse, and commeth after
mee, can not bee my disciple. 28 For which
of you minding to builde a towre, sitteth
not downe before, and counteth the cost,
whether hee haue sufficient to performe
it, 29 Lest that after he hath laide the
foundation, and is not able to performe
it, all that behold it, begin to mocke him,
30 Saying, This man began to builde, and
was not able to make an end? 31 Or what
King going to make warre against another
King, sitteth not downe first, and taketh
counsell, whether he be able with ten
thousande, to meete him that commeth
against him with twentie thousand? 32 Or
els while hee is yet a great way off,
hee sendeth an ambassage, and desireth
peace. 33 So likewise, whosoeuer hee be
of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath,
he cannot be my disciple. 34 Salt is good:
but if salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith
shall it be salted? 35 It is neither meete for
the land, nor yet for the dunghill, but men
cast it out. He that hath eares to heare, let
him heare.
15
Then resorted vnto him all the
Publicanes and sinners, to heare him.
2 Therefore the Pharises and Scribes mur-
mured, saying, Hee receiueth sinners, and
eateth with them. 3 Then spake hee this
parable to them, saying, 4 What man of
you hauing an hundreth sheepe, if hee
lose one of them, doeth not leaue ninetie
and nine in the wildernesse, and goe after
that which is lost, vntill he finde it? 5 And
when he hath found it, he laieth it on
his shoulders with ioye. 6 And when
he commeth home, he calleth together
his friendes and neighbours, saying vnto
them, Reioyce with mee: for I haue
founde my sheepe which was lost. 7 I
say vnto you, that likewise ioy shall be
in heauen for one sinner that conuerteth,
more then for ninetie and nine iust men,
1Luke 15:8
908
which neede none amendment of life.
8 Either what woman hauing ten groates,
if she lose one groate, doth not light a
candle, and sweepe the house, and seeke
diligently till shee finde it? 9 And when
shee hath found it, shee calleth her frien-
des, and neighbours, saying, Reioyce with
me: for I haue found the groate which
I had lost. 10 Likewise I say vnto you,
there is ioy in the presence of the Angels
of God, for one sinner that conuerteth.
11 He sayde moreouer, A certaine man
had two sonnes. 12 And the yonger of
them sayde to his father, Father, giue
mee the portion of the goods that falleth
to mee. So he deuided vnto them his
substance. 13 So not many daies after,
when the yonger sonne had gathered
all together, hee tooke his iourney into
a farre countrey, and there hee wasted
his goods with riotous liuing. 14 Nowe
when hee had spent all, there arose a
great dearth throughout that land, and
he began to be in necessitie. 15 Then
hee went and claue to a citizen of that
conntrey, and hee sent him to his farme,
to feede swine. 16 And hee would faine
haue filled his bellie with the huskes, that
the swine ate: but no man gaue them
him. 17 Then he came to him selfe, and
said, Howe many hired seruaunts at my
fathers haue bread ynough, and I die
for hunger? 18 I wil rise and goe to my
father, and say vnto him, Father, I haue
sinned against heaue, and before thee,
19 And am no more worthy to be called
thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired
seruants. 20 So hee arose and came to
his father, and when hee was yet a great
way off, his father sawe him, and had
compassion, and ranne and fell on his
necke, and kissed him. 21 And the sonne
sayde vnto him, Father, I haue sinned
against heauen, and before thee, and am
no more worthie to be called thy sonne.
22 Then the father said to his seruaunts,
Bring foorth the best robe, and put it on
him, and put a ring on his hand, and
shoes on his feete, 23 And bring the fat
calfe, and kill him, and let vs eate, and
be merie: 24 For this my sonne was dead,
Luke 16:7
and is aliue againe: and he was lost,
but he is found. And they began to be
merie. 25 Nowe the elder brother was in
the fielde, and when he came and drewe
neere to the house, he heard melodie,
and dauncing, 26 And called one of his
seruaunts, and asked what those things
meant. 27 And hee sayde vnto him, Thy
brother is come, and thy father hath killed
the fatte calfe, because he hath receiued
him safe and sound. 28 Then he was
angry, and would not goe in: therefore
came his father out and entreated him.
29 But he answered and said to his father,
Loe, these many yeeres haue I done thee
seruice, neither brake I at any time thy
commadement, and yet thou neuer gauest
mee a kidde that I might make merie with
my friends. 30 But when this thy sonne
was come, which hath deuoured thy good
with harlots, thou hast for his sake killed
the fat calfe. 31 And he said vnto him,
Sonne, thou art euer with me, and al that
I haue, is thine. It was meete that we
shoulde make merie, and be glad: for this
thy brother was dead, and is aliue againe:
and hee was lost, but he is found.
16
1 And he sayde also vnto his disciples,
There was a certaine riche man, which
had a stewarde, and he was accused vnto
him, that he wasted his goods. 2 And hee
called him, and saide vnto him, Howe
is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an
accounts of thy stewardship: for thou
maiest be no longer steward. 3 Then
the stewarde saide within himselfe, What
shall I doe? for my master taketh away
from me the stewardship. I cannot digge,
and to begge I am ashamed. 4 I knowe
what I will doe, that when I am put out
of the stewardship, they may receiue mee
into their houses. 5 Then called he vnto
him euery one of his masters detters, and
said vnto the first, Howe much owest
thou vnto my master? 6 And he said, An
hudreth measures of oyle. And he saide
to him, Take thy writing, and sitte downe
quickely, and write fiftie. 7 Then said
he to another, How much owest thou?
And hee sayde, An hundreth measures ofLuke 16:8
909
wheate. Then he saide to him, Take thy
writing, and write foure score. 8 And the
Lord commended the vniust stewarde,
because he had done wisely. Wherefore
the children of this worlde are in their
generation wiser then the children of
light. 9 And I say vnto you, Make you
friends with the riches of iniquitie, that
when ye shall want, they may receiue you
into euerlasting habitations. 10 He that is
faithfull in the least, hee is also faithful
in much: and he that is vniust in the
least, is vniust also in much. 11 If then ye
haue not ben faithful in the wicked riches,
who wil trust you in the true treasure?
12 And if ye haue not bene faithfull in
another mans goods, who shall giue you
that which is yours? 13 No seruaunt can
serue two masters: for either he shall
hate the one, and loue the other: or els
he shall leane to the one, and despise
the other. Yee can not serue God and
riches. 14 All these thinges heard the
Pharises also which were couetous, and
they scoffed at him. 15 Then he sayde vnto
them, Yee are they, which iustifie your
selues before men: but God knoweth your
heartes: for that which is highly esteemed
among men, is abomination in the sight
of God. 16 The Lawe and the Prophets
endured vntill Iohn: and since that time
the kingdome of God is preached, and
euery man preasseth into it. 17 Nowe it is
more easie that heauen and earth shoulde
passe away, then that one title of the Lawe
should fall. 18 Whosoeuer putteth away
his wife, and marieth another, commit-
teth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth
her that is put away from her husband,
committeth adulterie. 19 There was a
certaine riche man, which was clothed in
purple and fine linnen, and fared well
and delicately euery day. 20 Also there
was a certaine begger named Lazarus,
which was laide at his gate full of sores,
21 And desired to bee refreshed with the
crommes that fell from the riche mans
table: yea, and the dogges came and
licked his sores. 22 And it was so that the
begger died, and was caried by the Angels
into Abrahams bosome. The rich man
also died, and was buried. 23 And being
in hell in torments, he lift vp his eyes, and
Luke 17:7
sawe Abraham a farre off, and Lazarus in
his bosome. 24 Then he cried, and saide,
Father Abraham, haue mercie on mee,
and sende Lazarus that hee may dippe the
tip of his finger in water, and coole my
tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.
25 But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember
that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy
pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines:
now therefore is he comforted, and thou
art tormented. 26 Besides all this, be-
tweene you and vs there is a great gulfe
set, so that they which would goe from
hence to you, can not: neither can they
come from thence to vs. 27 Then he said,
I pray thee therfore, father, that thou
wouldest sende him to my fathers house,
28 (For I haue fiue brethren) that he may
testifie vnto them, least they also come
into this place of torment. 29 Abraham
said vnto him, They haue Moses and the
Prophets: let them heare them. 30 And
he sayde, Nay, father Abraham: but if
one came vnto them from the dead, they
will amend their liues. 31 Then he saide
vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the
Prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
though one rise from the dead againe.
17
1 Then said he to his disciples, It can not
be auoided, but that offences will come,
but wo be to him by whome they come.
2 It is better for him that a great milstone
were hanged about his necke, and that
he were cast into ye sea, then that he
should offende one of these litle ones.
3 Take heede to your selues: if thy brother
trespasse against thee, rebuke him: and if
hee repent, forgiue him. 4 And though he
sinne against thee seuen times in a day,
and seuen times in a day turne againe to
thee, saying, It repenteth mee, thou shalt
forgiue him. 5 And the Apostles saide vnto
the Lord, Increase our faith. 6 And the
Lord said, If ye had faith, as much as is a
graine of mustard seede, and should say
vnto this mulberie tree, Plucke thy selfe
vp by the rootes, and plant thy selfe in
the sea, it should euen obey you. 7 Who
is it also of you, that hauing a seruantLuke 17:8
910
plowing or feeding cattell, woulde say
vnto him by and by, when hee were come
from the fielde, Goe, and sit downe at
table? 8 And woulde not rather say to
him, Dresse wherewith I may suppe, and
girde thy selfe, and serue mee, till I haue
eaten and drunken, and afterward eate
thou, and drinke thou? 9 Doeth he thanke
that seruant, because hee did that which
was commanded vnto him? I trowe not.
10 So likewise yee, when yee haue done all
those things, which are commanded you,
say, We are vnprofitable seruants: wee
haue done that which was our duetie to
doe. 11 And so it was when he went to
Hierusalem, that he passed through the
middes of Samaria, and Galile. 12 And as
hee entred into a certaine towne, there
met him tenne men that were lepers,
which stoode a farre off. 13 And they lift
vp their voyces and saide, Iesus, Master,
haue mercie on vs. 14 And when he saw
them, he said vnto them, Goe, shewe
your selues vnto the Priestes. And it
came to passe, that as they went, they
were clensed. 15 Then one of them, when
hee sawe that hee, was healed, turned
backe, and with a loude voyce praised
God, 16 And fell downe on his face at
his feete, and gaue him thankes: and he
was a Samaritan. 17 And Iesus answered,
and said, Are there not tenne clensed?
but where are the nine? 18 There is
none founde that returned to giue God
praise, saue this stranger. 19 And he
saide vnto him, Arise, goe thy way, thy
faith hath saued thee. 20 And when hee
was demaunded of the Pharises, when
the kingdome of God shoulde come, he
answered them, and said, The kingdome
of God commeth not with obseruation.
21 Neither shall men say, Loe here, or
lo there: for behold, the kingdome of
God is within you. 22 And he saide vnto
the disciples, The dayes will come, when
ye shall desire to see one of the dayes
of the Sonne of man, and ye shall not
see it. 23 Then they shall say to you,
Behold here, or beholde there: but goe
not thither, neither follow them. 24 For
as the lightening that lighteneth out of
the one part vnder heauen, shineth vnto
Luke 18:5
the other part vnder heauen, so shall
the Sonne of man be in his day. 25 But
first must he suffer many things, and be
reprooued of this generation. 26 And as
it was in the dayes of Noe, so shall it be
in the dayes of the Sonne of man. 27 They
ate, they dranke, they married wiues, and
gaue in marriage vnto the day that Noe
went into the Arke: and the flood came,
and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise also,
as it was in the dayes of Lot: they ate,
they dranke, they bought, they solde, they
planted, they built. 29 But in the day that
Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and
brimstone from heauen, and destroyed
them all. 30 After these ensamples shall
it be in the day when the Sonne of man is
reueiled. 31 At that day hee that is vpon
the house, and his stuffe in ye house, let
him not come downe to take it out: and
he that is in the fielde likewise, let him
not turne backe to that he left behinde.
32 Remember Lots wife.
33 Whosoeuer
will seeke to saue his soule, shall loose
it: and whosoeuer shall loose it, shall
get it life. 34 I tell you, in that night
there shall be two in one bed: the one
shalbe receiued, and the other shalbe left.
35 Two women shalbe grinding together:
the one shalbe taken, and the other shalbe
left. 36 Two shalbe in the fielde: one
shalbe receiued, and another shalbe left.
37 And they answered, and saide to him,
Where, Lord? And he said vnto them,
Wheresoeuer the body is, thither shall
also the eagles bee gathered together.
1 And
18
he spake also a parable vnto
them, to this ende, that they ought al-
wayes to pray, and not to waxe faint,
2 Saying, There was a iudge in a cer-
taine citie, which feared not God, neither
3 And there was a
reuereced man.
widowe in that citie, which came vnto
him, saying, Doe mee iustice against mine
aduersarie. 4 And hee would not of a
long time: but afterward he said with
himselfe, Though I feare not God, nor
reuerence man, 5 Yet because this widowe
troubleth mee, I will doe her right, lest at
the last shee come and make me wearie.Luke 18:6
6 And
911
the Lord said, Heare what the
vnrighteous iudge saith. 7 Now shall not
God auenge his elect, which cry day and
night vnto him, yea, though he suffer long
for them? 8 I tell you he will auenge
them quickly: but when the Sonne of
man commeth, shall he finde faith on the
earth? 9 He spake also this parable vnto
certaine which trusted in themselues that
they were iust, and despised other. 10 Two
men went vp into the Temple to pray: the
one a Pharise, and the other a Publican.
11 The Pharise stoode and prayed thus
with himselfe, O God, I thanke thee that I
am not as other men, extortioners, vniust,
adulterers, or euen as this Publican. 12 I
fast twise in the weeke: I giue tithe
of all that euer I possesse. 13 But the
Publican standing a farre off, woulde not
lift vp so much as his eyes to heauen,
but smote his brest, saying, O God, be
mercifull to me a sinner. 14 I tell you,
this man departed to his house iustified,
rather then the other: for euery man that
exalteth himselfe, shall be brought lowe,
and he that humbleth himselfe, shalbe
exalted. 15 They brought vnto him also
babes that he should touche them. And
when his disciples sawe it, they rebuked
them. 16 But Iesus called them vnto him,
and said, Suffer the babes to come vnto
mee, and forbid them not: for of such is
the kingdome of God. 17 Verely I say vnto
you, whosoeuer receiueth not the king-
dome of God as a babe, he shall not enter
therein. 18 Then a certaine ruler asked
him, saying, Good Master, what ought I to
doe, to inherite eternall life? 19 And Iesus
said vnto him, Why callest thou me good?
none is good, saue one, euen God. 20 Thou
knowest the comandements, Thou shalt
not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not kill:
Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not
beare false witnes: Honour thy father and
thy mother. 21 And hee saide, All these
haue I kept from my youth. 22 Nowe when
Iesus heard that, he saide vnto him, Yet
lackest thou one thing. Sell all that euer
thou hast, and distribute vnto the poore,
and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen,
and come follow mee. 23 But when he
heard those things, he was very heauie:
Luke 18:43
for he was marueilous riche. 24 And
when Iesus sawe him very sorowfull, he
said, With what difficultie shall they that
haue riches, enter into the kingdome of
God! 25 Surely it is easier for a camel
to go through a needles eye, then for a
riche man to enter into the kingdome
of God. 26 Then said they that heard
it, And who then can be saued? 27 And
he said, The things which are vnpossible
with men, are possible with God. 28 Then
Peter said, Loe, we haue left all, and
haue followed thee. 29 And he said vnto
them, Verely I say vnto you, there is no
man that hath left house, or parents, or
brethren, or wife, or children for the
kingdome of Gods sake, 30 Which shall
not receiue much more in this world,
and in the world to come life euerlasting.
31 Then Iesus tooke vnto him ye twelue,
and said vnto them, Beholde, we goe
vp to Hierusalem, and all things shalbe
fulfilled to the Sonne of man, that are
writttn by the Prophets. 32 For he shall
be deliuered vnto the Gentiles, and shalbe
mocked, and shalbe spitefully entreated,
and shalbe spitted on. 33 And when they
haue scourged him, they will put him to
death: but the thirde day hee shall rise
againe. 34 But they vnderstood none of
these things, and this saying was hidde
from them, neither perceiued they the
things, which were spoken. 35 And it came
to passe, that as he was come neere vnto
Iericho, a certaine blinde man sate by
the way side, begging. 36 And when he
heard the people passe by, he asked what
it meant. 37 And they saide vnto him, that
Iesus of Nazareth passed by. 38 Then hee
cried, saying, Iesus the Sonne of Dauid,
haue mercie on me. 39 And they which
went before, rebuked him that he shoulde
holde his peace, but he cried much more,
O Sone of Dauid, haue mercie on me.
40 And Iesus stoode stil, and commanded
him to be brought vnto him. And when he
was come neere, he asked him, 41 Saying,
What wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? And
he said, Lord, that I may receiue my sight.
42 And Iesus said vnto him, Receiue thy
sight: thy faith hath saued thee. 43 ThenLuke 19:1
912
immediatly he receiued his sight, and
followed him, praysing God: and all the
people, when they sawe this, gaue praise
to God.
19
1 Now when Iesus entred and passed
through Iericho, 2 Beholde, there was a
man named Zaccheus, which was the
chiefe receiuer of the tribute, and he
was riche. 3 And he sought to see Iesus,
who hee should be, and coulde not for
the preasse, because he was of a lowe
stature. 4 Wherefore he ranne before,
and climed vp into a wilde figge tree, that
he might see him: for he should come
that way. 5 And when Iesus came to the
place, he looked vp, and saw him, and
said vnto him, Zaccheus, come downe at
once: for to day I must abide at thine
house. 6 Then he came downe hastily, and
receiued him ioyfully. 7 And when all they
sawe it, they murmured, saying, that hee
was gone in to lodge with a sinfull man.
8 And Zaccheus stood forth, and said vnto
the Lord, Beholde, Lord, the halfe of my
goods I giue to the poore: and if I haue
taken from any man by forged cauillation,
I restore him foure folde. 9 Then Iesus
said to him, This day is saluation come
vnto this house, forasmuch as hee is also
become the sonne of Abraham. 10 For the
Sonne of man is come to seeke, and to
saue that which was lost. 11 And whiles
they heard these thinges, hee continued
and spake a parable, because hee was
neere to Hierusalem, and because also
they thought that the kingdom of God
12 He saide
should shortly appeare.
therefore, A certaine noble man went into
a farre countrey, to receiue for himselfe a
kingdome, and so to come againe. 13 And
he called his ten seruants, and deliuered
them ten pieces of money, and sayd vnto
them, Occupie till I come. 14 Nowe his
citizens hated him, and sent an ambas-
sage after him, saying, We will not haue
15 And
this man to reigne ouer vs.
it came to passe, when hee was come
againe, and had receiued his kingdome,
that he commanded the seruants to be
called to him, to whome he gaue his
Luke 19:33
money, that he might knowe what euery
man had gained. 16 Then came the first,
saying, Lord, thy piece hath encreased
ten pieces. 17 And he sayd vnto him,
Well, good seruant: because thou hast
bene faithfull in a very litle thing, take
thou authoritie ouer ten cities. 18 And
the second came, saying, Lord, thy piece
hath encreased fiue pieces. 19 And to
the same he sayd, Be thou also ruler
ouer fiue cities. 20 So the other came,
and sayd, Lord, beholde thy piece, which
I haue laide vp in a napkin: 21 For I
feared thee, because thou art a straight
man: thou takest vp, that thou layedst
not downe, and reapest that thou diddest
not sowe. 22 Then he sayde vnto him,
Of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee,
O euill seruant. Thou knewest that I am
a straight man, taking vp that I layd not
downe, and reaping that I did not sowe.
23 Wherefore then gauest not thou my
money into the banke, that at my coming
I might haue required it with vantage?
24 And he sayd to them that stoode by,
Take from him that piece, and giue it
him that hath ten pieces. 25 (And they
sayd vnto him, Lord, hee hath ten pieces.)
26 For I say vnto you, that vnto all them
that haue, it shalbe giuen: and from him
that hath not, euen that he hath, shalbe
taken from him. 27 Moreouer, those mine
enemies, which would not that I should
reigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay
them before me. 28 And when he had thus
spoken, he went forth before, ascending
vp to Hierusalem. 29 And it came to passe,
when hee was come neere to Bethphage,
and Bethania, besides the mount which
is called the mount of Oliues, he sent
two of his disciples, 30 Saying, Goe ye to
the towne which is before you, wherein,
assoone as ye are come, ye shall finde a
colte tied, whereon neuer man sate: loose
him, and bring him hither. 31 And if any
man aske you, why ye loose him, thus
shall ye say vnto him, Because the Lord
hath neede of him. 32 So they that were
sent, went their way, and found it as he
had sayd vnto them. 33 And as they were
loosing the colte, the owners thereof saydLuke 19:34
913
vnto them, Why loose ye the colte? 34 And
they sayd, The Lord hath neede of him.
35 So they brought him to Iesus, and they
cast their garments on the colte, and set
Iesus thereon. 36 And as he went, they
spred their clothes in the way. 37 And
when he was nowe come neere to the
going downe of the mount of Oliues, the
whole multitude of the disciples began to
reioyce, and to prayse God with a loude
voyce, for all the great workes that they
had seene, 38 Saying, Blessed be the King
that commeth in the Name of the Lord:
peace in heauen, and glory in the highest
places. 39 Then some of the Pharises
of the companie sayd vnto him, Master,
rebuke thy disciples. 40 But he answered,
and sayd vnto them, I tell you, that if
these should holde their peace, the stones
would crie. 41 And when he was come
neere, he behelde the Citie, and wept
for it, 42 Saying, O if thou haddest euen
knowen at the least in this thy day those
things, which belong vnto thy peace! but
nowe are they hid from thine eyes. 43 For
the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine
enemies shall cast a trench about thee,
and compasse thee round, and keepe thee
in on euery side, 44 And shall make thee
euen with ye ground, and thy children
which are in thee, and they shall not leaue
in thee a stone vpon a stone, because thou
knewest not that season of thy visitation.
45 He went also into the Temple, and
began to cast out them that solde therein,
and them that bought, 46 Saying vnto
them, It is written, Mine house is the
house of prayer, but ye haue made it a
denne of theeues. 47 And he taught dayly
in the Temple. And the hie Priests and
the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people
sought to destroy him. 48 But they could
not finde what they might doe to him:
for all the people hanged vpon him when
they heard him.
20
1 And it came to passe, that on one of
those dayes, as he taught the people in
the Temple, and preached the Gospel, the
hie Priests and the Scribes came vpon him
Luke 20:18
with the Elders, 2 And spake vnto him,
saying, Tell vs by what authoritie thou
doest these things, or who is hee that
hath giuen thee this authoritie? 3 And
he answered, and sayde vnto them, I
also will aske you one thing: tell me
therefore: 4 The baptisme of Iohn, was
it from heauen, or of men? 5 And they
reasoned within themselues, saying, If we
shall say, From heauen, he will say, Why
then beleeued ye him not? 6 But if we
shall say, Of men, all the people will stone
vs: for they be perswaded that Iohn was
a Prophet. 7 Therefore they answered,
that they could not tell whence it was.
8 Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Neither tell
I you, by what authoritie I doe these
things. 9 Then began he to speake to
ye people this parable, A certaine man
planted a vineyarde, and let it forth to
husbandmen: and went into a strange
countrey, for a great time. 10 And at
the time conuenient he sent a seruant to
the husbandmen, that they should giue
him of the fruite of the vineyard: but
the husbandmen did beate him, and sent
him away emptie. 11 Againe he sent
yet another seruant: and they did beate
him, and foule entreated him, and sent
him away emptie. 12 Moreouer he sent
the third, and him they wounded, and
cast out. 13 Then sayd the Lord of the
vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send
my beloued sonne: it may be that they
will doe reuerence, when they see him.
14 But when the husbandmen sawe him,
they reasoned with themselues, saying,
This is the heire: come, let vs kill him,
that the inheritance may be ours. 15 So
they cast him out of the vineyarde, and
killed him. What shall the Lord of the
vineyarde therefore doe vnto them? 16 He
will come and destroy these husband-
men, and wil giue out his vineyard to
others. But when they heard it, they
sayd, God forbid. 17 And he beheld them,
and said, What meaneth this then that
is written, The stone that the builders
refused, that is made the head of the
corner? 18 Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that
stone, shall be broken: and on whom-Luke 20:19
soeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to
pouder. 19 Then the hie Priests, and the
Scribes the same houre went about to
lay hands on him: (but they feared the
people) for they perceiued that he had
spoken this parable against them. 20 And
they watched him, and sent forth spies,
which should faine themselues iust men,
to take him in his talke, and to deliuer
him vnto the power and authoritie of the
gouernour. 21 And they asked him, saying,
Master, we know that thou sayest, and
teachest right, neither doest thou accept
mans person, but teachest the way of God
truely. 22 Is it lawfull for vs to giue Cesar
tribute or no? 23 But he perceiued their
craftines, and sayd vnto them, Why tempt
ye me? 24 Shew me a penie. Whose
image and superscription hath it? They
answered, and sayd, Cesars. 25 Then he
sayd vnto them, Giue then vnto Cesar the
things which are Cesars, and to God those
which are Gods. 26 And they could not
reproue his saying before the people: but
they marueiled at his answere, and helde
their peace. 27 Then came to him certaine
of the Sadduces (which denie that there
is any resurrection) and they asked him,
28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs,
If any mans brother die hauing a wife,
and hee die without children, that his
brother should take his wife, and raise
vp seede vnto his brother. 29 Now there
were seuen brethren, and the first tooke
a wife, and he dyed without children.
30 And the second tooke the wife, and he
dyed childelesse. 31 Then the third tooke
her: and so likewise the seuen dyed, and
left no children. 32 And last of all the
woman dyed also. 33 Therefore at the
resurrection, whose wife of them shall
she be? for seuen had her to wife. 34 Then
Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, The
children of this world marry wiues, and
are married. 35 But they which shalbe
counted worthy to enioy that world, and
the resurrection from the dead, neither
marry wiues, neither are married. 36 For
they can die no more, forasmuch as they
are equall vnto the Angels, and are the
sonnes of God, since they are the children
914
Luke 21:8
of the resurrection. 37 And that the dead
shall rise againe, euen Moses shewed it
besides the bush, when he said, The Lord
is the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. 38 For
he is not the God of the dead, but of
them which liue: for all liue vnto him.
39 Then certaine of the Scribes answered,
and sayd, Master, thou hast well sayd.
40 And after that, durst they not aske
him any thing at all. 41 Then sayd he
vnto them, Howe say they that Christ is
Dauids sonne? 42 And Dauid himselfe
sayth in the booke of the Psalmes, The
Lord sayd vnto my Lord, Sit at my right
hand, 43 Till I shall make thine enemies
thy footestoole. 44 Seeing Dauid called
him Lord, howe is he then his sonne?
45 Then in the audience of all the people
he sayd vnto his disciples, 46 Beware of the
Scribes, which willingly go in long robes,
and loue salutations in the markets, and
the highest seates in the assemblies, and
the chiefe roomes at feastes: 47 Which
deuoure widowes houses, and in shewe
make long prayers: These shall receiue
greater damnation.
21
1 And as he behelde, he sawe the rich
men, which cast their giftes into the trea-
surie. 2 And he sawe also a certaine poore
widowe which cast in thither two mites:
3 And he sayd, Of a trueth I say vnto you,
that this poore widowe hath cast in more
then they all. 4 For they all haue of their
superfluitie cast into the offerings of God:
but she of her penurie hath cast in all the
liuing that she had. 5 Nowe as some spake
of the Temple, how it was garnished with
goodly stones, and with consecrate things,
he sayd, 6 Are these ye things that ye looke
vpon? the dayes will come wherein a
stone shall not be left vpon a stone, that
shall not be throwen downe. 7 Then they
asked him, saying, Master, but when shall
these things be? and what signe shall
there be when these things shall come
to passe? 8 And he sayd, Take heede,
that ye be not deceiued: for many will
come in my Name, saying, I am Christ,
and the time draweth neere: follow yeLuke 21:9
915
not them therefore. 9 And when ye heare
of warres and seditions, be not afraid:
for these things must first come, but the
ende foloweth not by and by. 10 Then said
hee vnto them, Nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdome against kingdome,
11 And great earthquakes shall be in
diuers places, and hunger, and pestilence,
and fearefull things, and great signes
shall there be from heauen. 12 But before
all these, they shall lay their hands on
you, and persecute you, deliuering you vp
to the assemblies, and into prisons, and
bring you before Kings and rulers for my
Names sake. 13 And this shall turne to you,
for a testimoniall. 14 Lay it vp therefore
in your heartes, that ye cast not before
hand, what ye shall answere. 15 For
I will giue you a mouth and wisdome,
where against all your aduersaries shall
not be able to speake, nor resist. 16 Yea,
ye shalbe betrayed also of your parents,
and of your brethren, and kinsmen, and
friendes, and some of you shall they put
to death. 17 And ye shall bee hated of
all men for my Names sake. 18 Yet there
shall not one heare of your heads perish.
19 By your patience possesse your soules.
20 And when ye see Hierusalem besieged
with souldiers, then vnderstand that the
desolation thereof is neere. 21 Then let
them which are in Iudea, flee to the
mountaines: and let them which are in
the middes thereof, depart out: and let
not them that are in the countrey, enter
therein. 22 For these be the dayes of
vengeance, to fulfill all things that are
written. 23 But woe be to them that be
with childe, and to them that giue sucke
in those dayes: for there shalbe great
distresse in this land, and wrath ouer
this people. 24 And they shall fall on
the edge of the sword, and shalbe led
captiue into all nations, and Hierusalem
shalbe troden vnder foote of the Gentiles,
vntill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
25 Then there shalbe signes in the sunne,
and in the moone, and in the starres,
and vpon the earth trouble among the
nations with perplexitie: the sea and the
waters shall roare. 26 And mens hearts
Luke 22:6
shall faile them for feare, and for looking
after those thinges which shall come on
the worlde: for the powers of heauen
shall be shaken. 27 And then shall they see
the Sonne of man come in a cloude, with
power and great glory. 28 And when these
things beginne to come to passe, then
looke vp, and lift vp your heades: for your
redemption draweth neere. 29 And he
spake to them a parable, Behold, the figge
tree, and all trees, 30 When they nowe
shoote foorth, ye seeing them, knowe of
your owne selues, that sommer is then
31 So likewise yee, when yee
neere.
see these thinges come to passe, knowe
ye that the kingdome of God is neere.
32 Verely I say vnto you, This age shall
not passe, till all these things be done:
33 Heauen and earth shall passe away, but
my wordes shall not passe away. 34 Take
heede to your selues, lest at any time your
hearts be oppressed with surfeting and
drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and
least that day come on you at vnwares.
35 For as a snare shall it come on all them
that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
36 Watche therefore, and pray continually,
that ye may be counted worthy to escape
all these thinges that shall come to passe,
and that ye may stand before the Sonne of
man. 37 Nowe in the day time hee taught
in the Temple, and at night hee went out,
and abode in the mount that is called the
mount of Oliues. 38 And all the people
came in the morning to him, to heare him
in the Temple.
1 Now
22
the feast of vnleauened bread
drewe neere, which is called the
Passeouer. 2 And the hie Priests and
Scribes sought how they might kill him:
for they feared the people. 3 Then entred
Satan into Iudas, who was called Iscariot,
and was of the nomber of the twelue.
4 And he went his way, and communed
with the hie Priestes and captaines, how
5 So
he might betray him to them.
they were glad, and agreed to giue him
money. 6 And he consented, and sought
opportunitie to betraye him vnto them,Luke 22:7
916
when the people were away. 7 Then
came the day of vnleauened bread, when
the Passeouer must be sacrificed. 8 And
he sent Peter and Iohn, saying, Go and
prepare vs the Passeouer, that we may
eate it. 9 And they saide to him, Where
wilt thou, that we prepare it? 10 Then
he said vnto them, Beholde, when ye be
entred into the citie, there shall a man
meete you, bearing a pitcher of water:
folowe him into the house that he entreth
in, 11 And say vnto the good man of
the house, The Master saith vnto thee,
Where is the lodging where I shall eate
my Passeouer with my disciples? 12 Then
he shall shewe you a great hie chamber
trimmed: there make it ready. 13 So they
went, and found as he had said vnto
them, and made readie the Passeouer.
14 And when the houre was come, hee
sate downe, and the twelue Apostles with
him. 15 Then he saide vnto them, I haue
earnestly desired to eate this Passeouer
with you, before I suffer. 16 For I say
vnto you, Hencefoorth I will not eate of
it any more, vntill it bee fulfilled in the
kingdome of God. 17 And hee tooke the
cup, and gaue thankes, and said, Take
this, and deuide it among you, 18 For I say
vnto you, I will not drinke of the fruite of
the vine, vntill the kingdome of God be
come. 19 And he tooke bread, and when
he had giuen thankes, he brake it, and
gaue to them, saying, This is my body,
which is giuen for you: doe this in the
remembrance of me. 20 Likewise also
after supper he tooke the cup, saying,
This cup is that newe Testament in my
blood, which is shed for you. 21 Yet
beholde, the hand of him that betrayeth
me, is with me at the table. 22 And
truely the Sonne of man goeth as it is
appointed: but woe be to that man, by
whom he is betrayed. 23 Then they began
to enquire among themselues which of
them it should be, that should do that.
24 And there arose also a strife among
them, which of them should seeme to be
ye greatest. 25 But hee saide vnto them,
The Kings of the Gentiles reigne ouer
them, and they that beare rule ouer them,
Luke 22:44
are called bountifull. 26 But yee shall not
be so: but let the greatest among you be
as the least: and the chiefest as he that
serueth. 27 For who is greater, he that
sitteth at table, or he that serueth? Is
not he that sitteth at table? And I am
among you as he that serueth. 28 And
yee are they which haue continued with
29 Therefore I
me in my tentations.
appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my
Father hath appointed vnto me, 30 That
ye may eate, and drinke at my table
in my kingdome, and sit on seates, and
iudge the twelue tribes of Israel. 31 And
the Lord saide, Simon, Simon, beholde,
Satan hath desired you, to winowe you as
wheate. 32 But I haue prayed for thee, that
thy faith faile not: therefore when thou
art conuerted, strengthen thy brethren.
33 And he said vnto him, Lord, I am
ready to goe with thee into prison, and
to death. 34 But he said, I tell thee, Peter,
the cocke shall not crowe this day, before
thou hast thrise denied that thou knewest
me. 35 And he saide vnto them, When I
sent you without bagge, and scrip, and
shooes, lacked ye any thing? And they
said, Nothing. 36 Then he said to them,
But nowe he that hath a bagge, let him
take it, and likewise a scrip: and hee that
hath none, let him sell his coate, and buy
a sworde. 37 For I say vnto you, That
yet the same which is written, must be
perfourmed in me, Euen with the wicked
was he nombred: for doubtlesse those
things which are written of me, haue an
ende. 38 And they said, Lord, beholde,
here are two swordes. And he said vnto
them, It is ynough. 39 And he came out,
and went (as he was wont) to the mount
of Oliues: and his disciples also followed
him. 40 And when hee came to the place,
hee said to them, Pray, lest ye enter
into tentation. 41 And he was drawen
aside from them about a stones cast, and
kneeled downe, and prayed, 42 Saying,
Father, if thou wilt, take away this cuppe
from mee: neuerthelesse, not my will, but
thine be done. 43 And there appeared an
Angell vnto him from heauen, comforting
him. 44 But being in an agonie, hee prayed
more earnestly: and his sweate was likeLuke 22:45
917
drops of blood, trickling downe to the
ground. 45 And he rose vp from prayer,
and came to his disciples, and found them
sleeping for heauinesse. 46 And he said
vnto them, Why sleepe ye? rise and
pray, least ye enter into tentation. 47 And
while he yet spake, beholde, a companie,
and he that was called Iudas one of the
twelue, went before them, and came
neere vnto Iesus to kisse him. 48 And
Iesus saide vnto him, Iudas, betrayest
thou the Sonne of man with a kisse?
49 Now when they which were about him,
saw what would follow, they said vnto
him, Lord, shall we smite with sworde?
50 And one of them smote a seruant of
the hie Priest, and strooke off his right
eare. 51 Then Iesus answered, and said,
Suffer them thus farre: and he touched
his eare, and healed him. 52 Then Iesus
said vnto the hie Priests, and captaines of
the Temple, and the Elders which were
come to him, Bee ye come out as vnto a
theefe with swordes and staues? 53 When
I was dayly with you in the Temple, yee
stretched not foorth the handes against
mee: but this is your very houre, and
the power of darkenesse. 54 Then tooke
they him, and led him, and brought him
to the hie Priestes house. And Peter
followed afarre off. 55 And when they
had kindled a fire in the middes of the
hall, and were set downe together, Peter
also sate downe among them. 56 And a
certaine mayde behelde him as hee sate
by the fire, and hauing well looked on
him, said, This man was also with him.
57 But he denied him, saying, Woman, I
know him not. 58 And after a little while,
another man sawe him, and saide, Thou
art also of them. But Peter said, Man,
I am not. 59 And about the space of an
houre after, a certaine other affirmed,
saying. Verely euen this man was with
him: for he is also a Galilean. 60 And Peter
saide, Man, I knowe not what thou sayest.
And immediatly while hee yet spake, the
cocke crewe. 61 Then the Lord turned
backe, and looked vpon Peter: and Peter
remembred the worde of the Lord, how
he had said vnto him, Before the cocke
crowe, thou shalt denie me thrise. 62 And
Peter went out, and wept bitterly. 63 And
Luke 23:11
the men that helde Iesus, mocked him,
and strooke him. 64 And when they had
blindfolded him, they smote him on the
face, and asked him, saying, Prophecie
who it is that smote thee. 65 And many
other thinges blasphemously spake they
against him. 66 And assoone as it was
day, the Elders of the people, and the hie
Priests and the Scribes came together, and
led him into their councill, 67 Saying, Art
thou that Christ? tell vs. And he said
vnto them, If I tell you, ye wil not beleeue
it. 68 And if also I aske you, you will not
answere me, nor let me goe. 69 Hereafter
shall the Sonne of man sit at the right
hand of the power of God. 70 Then sayd
they all, Art thou then ye Sonne of God?
And he sayd to them, Ye say, that I am.
71 Then sayd they, What neede we any
further witnes? for we our selues haue
heard it of his owne mouth.
1 Then
23
the whole multitude of them
arose, and led him vnto Pilate. 2 And they
began to accuse him, saying, We haue
found this man peruerting the nation, and
forbidding to pay tribute to Cesar, saying,
That he is Christ a King. 3 And Pilate
asked him, saying, Art thou the King of
the Iewes? And hee answered him, and
sayd, Thou sayest it. 4 Then sayd Pilate
to the hie Priests, and to the people, I
finde no fault in this man. 5 But they
were the more fierce, saying, He moueth
the people, teaching throughout all Iudea,
beginning at Galile, euen to this place.
6 Nowe when Pilate heard of Galile, he
asked whether the man were a Galilean.
7 And when he knewe that he was of
Herods iurisdiction, he sent him to Herod,
which was also at Hierusalem in those
dayes. 8 And when Herod sawe Iesus,
hee was exceedingly glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season,
because he had heard many things of
him, and trusted to haue seene some
signe done by him. 9 Then questioned
hee with him of many things: but he
answered him nothing. 10 The hie Priests
also and Scribes stood forth, and accused
him vehemently. 11 And Herod with hisLuke 23:12
918
men of warre, despised him, and mocked
him, and arayed him in white, and sent
him againe to Pilate. 12 And the same
day Pilate and Herod were made friends
together: for before they were enemies
one to another. 13 Then Pilate called
together the hie Priests and the rulers,
and the people, 14 And sayd vnto them, Ye
haue brought this man vnto me, as one
that peruerted the people: and beholde,
I haue examined him before you, and
haue found no fault in this man, of those
things whereof ye accuse him: 15 No, nor
yet Herod: for I sent you to him: and
loe, nothing worthy of death is done of
him. 16 I will therefore chastise him,
and let him loose. 17 (For of necessitie
hee must haue let one loose vnto them
at the feast.) 18 Then all ye multitude
cried at once, saying, Away with him, and
deliuer vnto vs Barabbas: 19 Which for
a certaine insurrection made in the citie,
and murder, was cast in prison. 20 Then
Pilate spake againe to them, willing to
let Iesus loose. 21 But they cried, saying,
Crucifie, crucifie him. 22 And he sayd vnto
them the third time, But what euill hath
he done? I finde no cause of death in
him: I will therefore chastise him, and
let him loose. 23 But they were instant
with loude voyces, and required that he
might be crucified: and the voyces of
them and of the hie Priests preuailed.
24 So Pilate gaue sentence, that it should
be as they required. 25 And he let loose
vnto them him that for insurrection and
murder was cast into prison, whome they
desired, and deliuered Iesus to doe with
him what they would. 26 And as they
led him away, they caught one Simon of
Cyrene, comming out of the fielde, and
on him they layde the crosse, to beare it
after Iesus. 27 And there followed him a
great multitude of people, and of women,
which women bewailed and lamented
him. 28 But Iesus turned backe vnto them,
and said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe
not for me, but weepe for your selues, and
for your children. 29 For behold, the dayes
wil come, when men shall say, Blessed are
the barren, and the wombes that neuer
bare, and the pappes which neuer gaue
Luke 23:49
sucke. 30 Then shall they begin to say to
the mountaines, Fall on vs: and to the
hilles, Couer vs. 31 For if they doe these
things to a greene tree, what shalbe done
to the drie? 32 And there were two others,
which were euill doers, led with him to be
slaine. 33 And when they were come to the
place, which is called Caluarie, there they
crucified him, and the euill doers: one at
the right hand, and the other at the left.
34 Then sayd Iesus, Father, forgiue them:
for they know not what they doe. And
they parted his raiment, and cast lottes.
35 And the people stoode, and behelde:
and the rulers mocked him with them,
saying, He saued others: let him saue
himselfe, if hee be that Christ, the Chosen
of God. 36 The souldiers also mocked him,
and came and offered him vineger, 37 And
said, If thou be the King of the Iewes, saue
thy selfe. 38 And a superscription was
also written ouer him, in Greeke letters,
and in Latin, and in Hebrewe, THIS IS
THAT KING OF THE JEWES. 39 And one
of the euill doers, which were hanged,
railed on him, saying, If thou be that
Christ, saue thy selfe and vs. 40 But
the other answered, and rebuked him,
saying, Fearest thou not God, seeing thou
art in the same condemnation? 41 We
are in deede righteously here: for we
receiue things worthy of that we haue
done: but this man hath done nothing
amisse. 42 And he sayd vnto Iesus, Lord,
remember me, when thou commest into
thy kingdome. 43 Then Iesus said vnto
him, Verely I say vnto thee, to day shalt
thou be with me in Paradise. 44 And it
was about the sixt houre: and there was a
darkenes ouer all the land, vntill the ninth
houre. 45 And the Sunne was darkened,
and the vaile of the Temple rent through
the middes. 46 And Iesus cryed with a
loude voyce, and sayd, Father, into thine
hands I commend my spirit. And when
hee thus had sayd, hee gaue vp the ghost.
47 Nowe when the Centurion saw what
was done, he glorified God, saying, Of a
suretie this man was iust. 48 And all the
people that came together to that sight,
beholding the things, which were done,
smote their brestes, and returned. 49 AndLuke 23:50
919
all his acquaintance stood a farre off,
and the women that followed him from
Galile, beholding these things. 50 And
beholde, there was a man named Ioseph,
which was a counseller, a good man and
a iust. 51 Hee did not consent to the
counsell and deede of them, which was
of Arimathea, a citie of the Iewes: who
also himselfe waited for the kingdome of
God. 52 He went vnto Pilate, and asked
the body of Iesus, 53 And tooke it downe,
and wrapped it in a linnen cloth, and
laide it in a tombe hewen out of a rocke,
wherein was neuer man yet laide. 54 And
that day was the preparation, and the
Sabbath drewe on. 55 And the women
also that followed after, which came with
him from Galile, behelde the sepulchre,
and how his body was layd. 56 And
they returned and prepared odours, and
ointments, and rested the Sabbath day
according to the commandement.
24
1 Nowe the first day of the weeke early
in the morning, they came vnto the sepul-
chre, and brought the odours, which they
had prepared, and certaine women with
them. 2 And they found the stone rolled
away from the sepulchre, 3 And went in,
but found not the body of the Lord Iesus.
4 And it came to passe, that as they were
amased thereat, beholde, two men sud-
denly stood by them in shining vestures.
5 And as they were afraide, and bowed
downe their faces to the earth, they sayd
to them, Why seeke ye him that liueth,
among the dead? 6 He is not here, but
is risen: remember how he spake vnto
you, when he was yet in Galile, 7 Saying,
that the sonne of man must be deliuered
into the hands of sinfull men, and be
crucified, and the third day rise againe.
8 And they remembred his wordes, 9 And
returned from the sepulchre, and tolde
all these things vnto the eleuen, and to
all the remnant. 10 Now it was Mary
Magdalene, and Ioanna, and Mary the
mother of Iames, and other women with
them, which tolde these things vnto the
Apostles. 11 But their wordes seemed
Luke 24:27
vnto them, as a fained thing, neither
beleeued they them. 12 Then arose Peter,
and ran vnto the sepulchre, and looked
in, and saw the linnen clothes laide
by themselues, and departed wondering
in himselfe at that which was come to
passe. 13 And beholde, two of them went
that same day to a towne which was
from Hierusalem about threescore fur-
longs, called Emmaus. 14 And they talked
together of al these things that were
done. 15 And it came to passe, as they
communed together, and reasoned, that
Iesus himselfe drewe neere, and went
with them. 16 But their eyes were holden,
that they could not know him. 17 And he
sayd vnto them, What maner of commu-
nications are these that ye haue one to
another as ye walke and are sad? 18 And
the one (named Cleopas) answered, and
sayd vnto him, Art thou onely a stranger
in Hierusalem, and hast not knowen the
things which are come to passe therein
in these dayes? 19 And he said vnto
them, What things? And they sayd vnto
him, Of Iesus of Nazareth, which was a
Prophet, mightie in deede and in word
before God, and all people, 20 And howe
the hie Priests, and our rulers deliuered
him to be condemned to death, and haue
crucified him. 21 But we trusted that it
had bene he that should haue deliuered
Israel, and as touching all these things, to
day is ye third day, that they were done.
22 Yea, and certaine women among vs
made vs astonied, which came early vnto
the sepulchre. 23 And when they found
not his body, they came, saying, that they
had also seene a vision of Angels, which
sayd, that he was aliue. 24 Therefore
certaine of them which were with vs,
went to the sepulchre, and found it euen
so as the women had sayd, but him they
saw not. 25 Then he sayd vnto them, O
fooles and slowe of heart to beleeue all
that the Prophets haue spoken! 26 Ought
not Christ to haue suffered these things,
and to enter into his glory? 27 And he
began at Moses, and at all the Prophets,
and interpreted vnto them in all the
Scriptures the things which were writtenLuke 24:28
920
of him. 28 And they drew neere vnto
ye towne, which they went to, but he
made as though hee would haue gone
further. 29 But they constrained him,
saying, Abide with vs: for it is towards
night, and the day is farre spent. So he
went in to tarie with them. 30 And it
came to passe, as hee sate at table with
them, he tooke the bread, and blessed,
and brake it, and gaue it to them. 31 Then
their eyes were opened, and they knewe
him: and he was no more seene of them.
32 And they saide betweene themselues,
Did not our heartes burne within vs,
while he talked with vs by the way, and
when he opened to vs the Scriptures?
33 And they rose vp the same houre, and
returned to Hierusalem, and found the
Eleuen gathered together, and them that
were with them, 34 Which said, The Lord
is risen in deede, and hath appeared to
Simon. 35 Then they tolde what things
were done in the way, and howe he was
knowen of them in breaking of bread.
36 And as they spake these things, Iesus
himselfe stoode in the middes of them,
and saide vnto them, Peace be to you.
37 But they were abashed and afraide,
supposing that they had seene a spirit.
38 Then he saide vnto them, Why are ye
troubled? and wherefore doe doutes arise
in your hearts? 39 Beholde mine handes
and my feete: for it is I my selfe: handle
me, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and
bones, as ye see me haue. 40 And when
he had thus spoken, he shewed them his
hands and feete. 41 And while they yet
beleeued not for ioy, and wondred, he
saide vnto them, Haue ye here any meate?
42 And they gaue him a piece of a broyled
fish, and of an honie combe, 43 And hee
tooke it, and did eate before them. 44 And
he saide vnto them, These are the wordes,
which I spake vnto you while I was yet
with you, that all must be fulfilled which
are written of me in the Lawe of Moses,
and in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes.
45 Then opened he their vnderstanding,
that they might vnderstand the Scrip-
tures, 46 And said vnto them, Thus is it
written, and thus it behoued Christ to
Luke 24:53
suffer, and to rise againe from the dead
the third day, 47 And that repentance, and
remission of sinnes should be preached in
his Name among all nations, beginning at
Hierusalem. 48 Nowe ye are witnesses of
these things. 49 And beholde, I doe sende
the promise of my Father vpon you: but
tary ye in the citie of Hierusalem, vntill
ye be endued with power from an hie.
50 Afterward he lead them out into Betha-
nia, and lift vp his hands, and blessed
them. 51 And it came to passe, that as
he blessed them, he departed from them,
and was caried vp into heauen. 52 And
they worshipped him, and returned to
Hierusalem with great ioy, 53 And were
continually in the Temple, praysing, and
lauding God, Amen.John 1:1
921
THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN
1 In the beginning was that Word, and
that Word was with God, and that Word
was God. 2 This same was in the begin-
ning with God. 3 All things were made
by it, and without it was made nothing
that was made. 4 In it was life, and that
life was the light of men. 5 And that light
shineth in the darkenesse, and the dark-
enesse comprehended it not. 6 There was
a man sent from God, whose name was
Iohn. 7 This same came for a witnesse, to
beare witnesse of that light, that all men
through him might beleeue. 8 He was not
that light, but was sent to beare witnesse
of that light. 9 This was that true light,
which lighteth euery man that commeth
into the world. 10 He was in the world,
and the worlde was made by him: and
the worlde knewe him not. 11 He came
vnto his owne, and his owne receiued
him not. 12 But as many as receiued him,
to them he gaue prerogatiue to be the
sonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue
in his Name. 13 Which are borne not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
ye wil of man, but of God. 14 And that
Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
vs, (and we sawe the glorie thereof, as the
glorie of the onely begotten Sonne of the
Father) full of grace and trueth. 15 Iohn
bare witnesse of him, and cryed, saying,
This was he of whom I said, He that
commeth after me, was before me: for he
was better then I. 16 And of his fulnesse
haue all we receiued, and grace for grace.
17 For the Lawe was giuen by Moses, but
grace, and trueth came by Iesus Christ.
18 No man hath seene God at any time:
that onely begotten Sonne, which is in the
bosome of the Father, he hath declared
him. 19 Then this is the record of Iohn,
when the Iewes sent Priestes and Leuites
from Hierusalem, to aske him, Who art
thou? 20 And he confessed and denied not,
and said plainely, I am not that Christ.
21 And they asked him, What then? Art
thou Elias? And he said, I am not. Art
John 1:40
thou that Prophet? And he answered, No.
22 Then said they vnto him, Who art thou,
that we may giue an answere to them that
sent vs? What sayest thou of thy selfe?
23 He said, I am the voyce of him that
cryeth in the wildernesse, Make straight
the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet
Esaias. 24 Nowe they which were sent,
were of the Pharises. 25 And they asked
him, and saide vnto him, Why baptizest
thou then, if thou be not that Christ,
neither Elias, nor that Prophet? 26 Iohn
answered them, saying, I baptize with
water: but there is one among you, whom
ye knowe not. 27 He it is that commeth
after me, which was before me, whose
shoe latchet I am not worthie to vnloose.
28 These things were done in Bethabara
beyond Iordan, where Iohn did baptize.
29 The next day Iohn, seeth Iesus comming
vnto him, and saith, Beholde that Lambe
of God, which taketh away the sinne of
the world. 30 This is he of whom I saide,
After me commeth a man, which was
before me: for he was better then I. 31 And
I knewe him not: but because he should
be declared to Israel, therefore am I come,
baptizing with water. 32 So Iohn bare
recorde, saying, I behelde that Spirit come
downe from heauen, like a doue, and
it abode vpon him, 33 And I knewe him
not: but he that sent me to baptize with
water, he saide vnto me, Vpon whom thou
shalt see that Spirit come downe, and tary
still on him, that is he which baptizeth
with the holy Ghost. 34 And I sawe, and
bare record that this is that Sonne of God.
35 The next day, Iohn stoode againe, and
two of his disciples. 36 And he behelde
Iesus walking by, and said, Beholde that
Lambe of God. 37 And the two disciples
heard him speake, and followed Iesus.
38 Then Iesus turned about, and saw them
follow, and saide vnto them, What seeke
ye? And they saide vnto him, Rabbi
(which is to say by interpretation, Master)
where dwellest thou? 39 He saide vnto
them, Come, and see. They came and
sawe where hee dwelt, and abode with
him that day: for it was about the tenth
houre. 40 Andrew, Simon Peters brother,
was one of the two which had heard it ofJohn 1:41
922
Iohn, and that followed him. 41 The same
founde his brother Simon first, and said
vnto him, We haue founde that Messias,
which is by interpretation, that Christ.
42 And he brought him to Iesus. And Iesus
behelde him, and saide, Thou art Simon
the sonne of Iona: thou shalt be called
Cephas, which is by interpretation, a
stone. 43 The day following, Iesus woulde
goe into Galile, and founde Philip, and
said vnto him, Followe me. 44 Nowe Philip
was of Bethsaida, the citie of Andrew and
Peter. 45 Philippe founde Nathanael, and
saide vnto him, Wee haue founde him
of whom Moses did write in the Lawe,
and the Prophetes, Iesus that sonne of
Ioseph, that was of Nazareth. 46 Then
Nathanael sayde vnto him, Can there any
good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip
saide to him, Come, and see. 47 Iesus sawe
Nathanael comming to him, and saide of
him, Beholde in deede an Israelite, in
whom is no guile. 48 Nathanael sayde vnto
him, Whence knewest thou mee? Iesus
answered, and sayd vnto him, Before that
Philip called thee, when thou wast vnder
the figge tree, I sawe thee. 49 Nathanael
answered, and saide vnto him, Rabbi,
thou art that Sonne of God: thou art
that King of Israel. 50 Iesus answered,
and sayde vnto him, Because I sayde
vnto thee, I sawe thee vnder the figtree,
beleeuest thou? thou shalt see greater
things then these. 51 And he saide vnto
him, Verely, verely I say vnto you, here-
after shall yee see heauen open, and the
Angels of God ascending, and descending
vpon that Sonne of man.
2
And the thirde day, was there a
mariage in Cana a towne of Galile, and
the mother of Iesus was there. 2 And Iesus
was called also, and his disciples vnto the
mariage. 3 Nowe when the wine failed,
the mother of Iesus saide vnto him, They
haue no wine. 4 Iesus saide vnto her,
Woman, what haue I to doe with thee?
mine houre is not yet come. 5 His mother
saide vnto the seruants, Whatsoeuer he
sayeth vnto you, doe it. 6 And there were
set there, sixe waterpots of stone, after
1
John 2:22
the maner of the purifying of the Iewes,
conteining two or three firkins a piece.
7 And Iesus sayde vnto them, Fill the
waterpots with water. Then they filled
them vp to the brim. 8 Then he sayde
vnto them, Draw out nowe and beare
vnto the gouernour of the feast. So they
bare it. 9 Nowe when the gouernour of
the feast had tasted the water that was
made wine, (for he knewe not whence
it was: but the seruants, which drewe
the water, knewe) the gouernour of ye
feast called the bridegrome, 10 And saide
vnto him, All men at the beginning set
foorth good wine, and when men haue
well drunke, then that which is worse:
but thou hast kept backe the good wine
vntill nowe. 11 This beginning of miracles
did Iesus in Cana a towne of Galile,
and shewed forth his glorie: and his
disciples beleeued on him. 12 After that,
he went downe into Capernaum, he and
his mother, and his brethren, and his
disciples: but they continued not many
daies there. 13 For the Iewes Passeouer
was at hande. Therefore Iesus went vp
to Hierusalem. 14 And he found in the
Temple those that sold oxen, and sheepe,
and doues, and changers of money, sitting
there. 15 Then hee made a scourge of
small cordes, and draue them all out of
the Temple with the sheepe and oxen,
and powred out the changers money,
and ouerthrewe the tables, 16 And said
vnto them that solde doues, Take these
things hence: make not my fathers house,
an house of marchandise. 17 And his
disciples remembred, that it was written,
The zeale of thine house hath eaten me
vp. 18 Then answered the Iewes, and
saide vnto him, What signe shewest thou
vnto vs, that thou doest these things?
19 Iesus answered, and said vnto them,
Destroy this Temple, and in three daies I
will raise it vp againe. 20 Then said the
Iewes, Fourtie and sixe yeeres was this
Temple a building, and wilt thou reare
it vp in three daies? 21 But he spake
of the temple of his bodie. 22 Assoone
therefore as he was risen from the dead,
his disciples remembred that hee thus
sayde vnto them: and they beleeued theJohn 2:23
923
Scripture, and the worde which Iesus
had saide. 23 Nowe when hee was at
Hierusalem at the Passeouer in the feast,
many beleeued in his Name, when they
sawe his miracles which he did. 24 But
Iesus did not commit him selfe vnto them,
because he knewe them all, 25 And had no
neede that any should testifie of man: for
he knewe what was in man.
3
1 There was nowe a man of the Pharises,
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Iewes.
2 This man came to Iesus by night, and
sayd vnto him, Rabbi, we knowe ye thou
art a teacher come from God: for no
man could do these miracles that thou
doest, except God were with him. 3 Iesus
answered, and said vnto him, Verely,
verely I say vnto thee, except a man
be borne againe, he can not see the
kingdome of God. 4 Nicodemus sayde vnto
him, Howe can a man be borne which
is olde? can he enter into his mothers
wombe againe, and be borne? 5 Iesus
answered, Verely, verely I say vnto thee,
except that a man be borne of water and
of the Spirite, hee can not enter into the
kingdome of God. 6 That which is borne
of the flesh, is flesh: and that that is borne
of the Spirit, is spirit. 7 Marueile not that
I said to thee, Yee must be borne againe.
8 The winde bloweth where it listeth, and
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst
not tell whence it commeth, and whither
it goeth: so is euery man that is borne
of the Spirit. 9 Nicodemus answered, and
said vnto him, Howe can these things be?
10 Iesus answered, and saide vnto him,
Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest
not these things? 11 Verely, verely I say
vnto thee, wee speake that we know,
and testifie that we haue seene: but yee
receiue not our witnesse. 12 If when I
tel you earthly things, ye beleeue not,
howe should yee beleeue, if I shall tel
you of heauenly things? 13 For no man
ascendeth vp to heauen, but he that hath
descended from heauen, that Sonne of
man which is in heauen. 14 And as Moses
lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse, so
must that Sonne of man be lift vp, 15 That
whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shoulde not
John 3:32
perish, but haue eternall life. 16 For God
so loued the worlde, that hee hath giuen
his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoeuer
beleeueth in him, should not perish, but
haue euerlasting life. 17 For God sent not
his Sonne into the world, that he should
condemne the world, but that the world
through him might be saued. 18 Hee
that beleeueth in him, is not condemned:
but hee that beleeueth not, is condemned
already, because he hath not beleeued in
the Name of that onely begotten Sonne of
God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that
that light came into the worlde, and men
loued darknesse rather then that light,
because their deedes were euill. 20 For
euery man that euill doeth, hateth the
light, neither commeth to light, least his
deedes should be reprooued. 21 But he
that doeth trueth, commeth to the light,
that his deedes might bee made manifest,
that they are wrought according to God.
22 After these things, came Iesus and his
disciples into the lande of Iudea, and
there taried with them, and baptized.
23 And Iohn also baptized in Enon besides
Salim, because there was much water
there: and they came, and were baptized.
24 For Iohn was not yet cast into prison.
25 Then there arose a question betweene
Iohns disciples and the Iewes, about pu-
rifying. 26 And they came vnto Iohn, and
saide vnto him, Rabbi, he that was with
thee beyond Iorden, to whom thou barest
witnesse, behold, he baptizeth, and all
men come to him. 27 Iohn answered, and
saide, A man can receiue nothing, except
it be giuen him from heauen. 28 Yee your
selues are my witnesses, that I sayde, I
am not that Christ, but that I am sent
before him. 29 He that hath the bride,
is the bridegrome: but the friend of the
bridegrome which standeth and heareth
him, reioyceth greatly, because of the
bridegromes voyce. This my ioy therefore
is fulfilled. 30 He must increase, but I
must decrease. 31 Hee that is come from
an hie, is aboue all: he that is of the
earth, is of the earth, and speaketh of the
earth: hee that is come from heauen, is
aboue all. 32 And what hee hath seene
and heard, that he testifieth: but no manJohn 3:33
924
receiueth his testimonie. 33 He that hath
receiued his testimonie, hath sealed that
God is true. 34 For hee whome God hath
sent, speaketh the woordes of God: for
God giueth him not the Spirit by measure.
35 The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath
giuen all things into his hande. 36 Hee that
beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerlasting
life, and hee that obeyeth not the Sonne,
shall not see life, but the wrath of God
abideth on him.
4
Nowe when the Lord knew, how
the Pharises had heard, that Iesus made
and baptized moe disciples then Iohn,
2 (Though Iesus himselfe baptized not:
but his disciples) 3 Hee left Iudea, and
departed againe into Galile. 4 And he
must needes goe through Samaria. 5 Then
came hee to a citie of Samaria called
Sychar, neere vnto the possession that
Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph. 6 And
there was Iacobs well. Iesus then wearied
in the iourney, sate thus on the well: it
was about the sixt houre. 7 There came a
woman of Samaria to drawe water. Iesus
sayd vnto her, Giue me drinke. 8 For his
disciples were gone away into the citie,
to buy meate. 9 Then sayde the woman
of Samaria vnto him, Howe is it, that
thou being a Iewe, askest drinke of me,
which am a woman of Samaria? For the
Iewes meddle not with the Samaritans.
10 Iesus answered and saide vnto her, If
thou knewest that gift of God, and who
it is that saieth to thee, Giue mee drinke,
thou wouldest haue asked of him, and
hee woulde haue giuen thee, water of life.
11 The woman saide vnto him, Sir, thou
hast nothing to drawe with, and the well
is deepe: from whence then hast thou
that water of life? 12 Art thou greater
then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the
well, and hee himselfe dranke thereof,
and his sonnes, and his cattell? 13 Iesus
answered, and said vnto her, Whosoeuer
drinketh of this water, shall thirst againe:
14 But whosoeuer drinketh of the water
that I shall giue him, shall neuer be
more a thirst: but the water that I shall
giue him, shalbe in him a well of water,
springing vp into euerlasting life. 15 The
1
John 4:35
woman said vnto him, Syr, giue me of
that water, that I may not thirst, neither
come hither to drawe. 16 Iesus said vnto
her, Go, call thine husband, and come
hither. 17 The woman answered, and
saide, I haue no husband. Iesus said
vnto her, Thou hast well said, I haue
no husband. 18 For thou hast had fiue
husbands, and he whom thou nowe hast,
is not thine husband: that saidest thou
truely. 19 The woman saide vnto him,
Sir, I see that thou art a Prophet. 20 Our
fathers worshipped in this mountaine,
and ye say, that in Ierusalem is the place
where men ought to worship. 21 Iesus
saide vnto her, Woman, beleeue me, the
houre commeth, when ye shall neither in
this mountaine, nor at Hierusalem wor-
ship ye Father. 22 Ye worship that which
ye knowe not: we worship that which
we knowe: for saluation is of the Iewes.
23 But the houre commeth, and nowe is,
when the true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit, and trueth: for the
Father requireth euen such to worship
him. 24 God is a Spirite, and they that
worship him, must worship him in spirit
and trueth. 25 The woman said vnto him, I
knowe well that Messias shall come which
is called Christ: when he is come, he will
tell vs all things. 26 Iesus said vnto her, I
am he, that speake vnto thee. 27 And vpon
that, came his disciples, and marueiled
that he talked with a woman: yet no man
said vnto him, What askest thou? or why
talkest thou with her? 28 The woman then
left her waterpot, and went her way into
the citie, and said to the men, 29 Come,
see a man which hath tolde me all things
that euer I did: is not he that Christ?
30 Then they went out of the citie, and
came vnto him. 31 In the meane while, the
disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eate.
32 But he said vnto them, I haue meate to
eate that ye know not of. 33 Then said ye
disciples betweene themselues, Hath any
man brought him meate? 34 Iesus saide
vnto them, My meate is that I may doe
the will of him that sent me, and finish his
worke. 35 Say not ye, There are yet foure
moneths, and then commeth haruest?
Beholde, I say vnto you, Lift vp yourJohn 4:36
925
eyes, and looke on the regions: for they
are white alreadie vnto haruest. 36 And
he that reapeth, receiueth rewarde, and
gathereth fruite vnto life eternall, that
both he that soweth, and he that reapeth,
might reioyce together. 37 For herein is
the saying true, that one soweth, and an
other reapeth. 38 I sent you to reape
that, whereon ye bestowed no labour:
other men laboured, and ye are entred
into their labours. 39 Nowe many of
the Samaritans of that citie beleeued in
him, for the saying of the woman which
testified, He hath tolde me all things that
euer I did. 40 Then when the Samaritans
were come vnto him, they besought him,
that he woulde tarie with them: and he
abode there two dayes. 41 And many
moe beleeued because of his owne word.
42 And they said vnto the woman, Nowe
we beleeue, not because of thy saying:
for we haue heard him our selues, and
knowe that this is in deede that Christ the
Sauiour of the world. 43 So two dayes after
he departed thence, and went into Galile.
44 For Iesus himselfe had testified, that a
Prophet hath none honour in his owne
countrey. 45 Then when he was come into
Galile, the Galileans receiued him, which
had seene all the things that he did at
Hierusalem at the feast: for they went
also vnto the feast. 46 And Iesus came
againe into Cana a towne of Galile, where
he had made of water, wine. And there
was a certaine ruler, whose sonne was
sicke at Capernaum. 47 When he heard
that Iesus was come out of Iudea into
Galile, he went vnto him, and besought
him that he would goe downe, and heale
his sonne: for he was euen ready to
die. 48 Then saide Iesus vnto him, Except
ye see signes and wonders, ye will not
beleeue. 49 The ruler said vnto him, Syr,
goe downe before my sonne dye. 50 Iesus
said vnto him, Go thy way, thy sonne
liueth: and the man beleeued the worde
that Iesus had spoken vnto him, and went
his way. 51 And as he was nowe going
downe, his seruants met him, saying, Thy
sonne liueth. 52 Then enquired he of them
the houre when he began to amend. And
they said vnto him, Yesterday the seuenth
John 5:15
houre the feuer left him. 53 Then the
father knew, that it was the same houre
in the which Iesus had said vnto him, Thy
sonne liueth. And he beleeued, and all
his houshold. 54 This second miracle did
Iesus againe, after he was come out of
Iudea into Galile.
1 After
5
that, there was a feast of the
Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.
2 And there is at Hierusalem by the place
of the sheepe, a poole called in Ebrew
Bethesda, hauing fiue porches: 3 In the
which lay a great multitude of sicke folke,
of blinde, halte, and withered, wayting
for the mouing of the water. 4 For an
Angel went downe at a certaine season
into the poole, and troubled the water:
whosoeuer then first, after the stirring of
the water, stepped in, was made whole
of whatsoeuer disease he had. 5 And a
certaine man was there, which had bene
diseased eight and thirtie yeeres. 6 When
Iesus sawe him lie, and knew that he
nowe long time had bene diseased, he
saide vnto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
7 The sicke man answered him, Sir, I haue
no man, when the water is troubled, to
put me into the poole: but while I am
comming, another steppeth downe before
me. 8 Iesus said vnto him, Rise: take vp
thy bed, and walke. 9 And immediatly
the man was made whole, and tooke vp
his bed, and walked: and the same day
was the Sabbath. 10 The Iewes therefore
said to him that was made whole, It is the
Sabbath day: it is not lawfull for thee to
cary thy bed. 11 He answered them, He
that made me whole, he said vnto me,
Take vp thy bed, and walke. 12 Then asked
they him, What man is that which said
vnto thee, Take vp thy bed and walke?
13 And he that was healed, knewe not who
it was: for Iesus had conueied himselfe
away from the multitude that was in that
place. 14 And after that, Iesus founde
him in the Temple, and said vnto him,
Beholde, thou art made whole: sinne no
more, lest a worse thing come vnto thee.
15 The man departed and tolde the Iewes
that it was Iesus, which had made himJohn 5:16
whole. 16 And therefore the Iewes did
persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him,
because he had done these things on the
Sabbath day. 17 But Iesus answered them,
My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke.
18 Therefore the Iewes sought the more to
kill him: not onely because he had broken
the Sabbath: but said also that God was
his Father, and made himselfe equall with
God. 19 Then answered Iesus, and said
vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you,
The Sonne can doe nothing of himselfe,
saue that he seeth the Father doe: for
whatsoeuer things he doth, the same
things doeth the Sonne in like maner.
20 For the Father loueth the Sonne, and
sheweth him all things, whatsoeuer he
himselfe doeth, and he will shewe him
greater workes then these, that ye should
marueile. 21 For likewise as the Father
rayseth vp the dead, and quickeneth
them, so the Sonne quickeneth whom
he will. 22 For the Father iudgeth no
man, but hath committed all iudgement
vnto the Sonne, 23 Because that all men
shoulde honour the Sonne, as they hon-
our the Father: he that honoureth not
the Sonne, the same honoureth not the
Father, which hath sent him. 24 Verely,
verely I say vnto you, he that heareth my
worde, and beleeueth him that sent me,
hath euerlasting life, and shall not come
into condemnation, but hath passed from
death vnto life. 25 Verely, verely I say vnto
you, the houre shall come, and now is,
when the dead shall heare the voyce of
the Sonne of God: and they that heare it,
shall liue. 26 For as the Father hath life
in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to
the Sonne to haue life in himselfe, 27 And
hath giuen him power also to execute
iudgement, in that he is the Sonne of man.
28 Marueile not at this: for the houre shall
come, in the which all that are in the
graues, shall heare his voyce. 29 And they
shall come foorth, that haue done good,
vnto ye resurrection of life: but they that
haue done euil, vnto the resurrection of
condemnation. 30 I can doe nothing of
mine owne selfe: as I heare, I iudge:
and my iudgement is iust, because I seeke
not mine owne will, but the will of the
926
John 6:4
Father who hath sent me. 31 If I should
beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse
were not true. 32 There is another that
beareth witnesse of me, and I know that
the witnesse, which he beareth of me, is
true. 33 Ye sent vnto Iohn, and he bare
witnesse vnto the trueth. 34 But I receiue
not the record of man: neuerthelesse
these things I say, that ye might be
saued. 35 He was a burning, and a shining
candle: and ye would for a season haue
reioyced in his light. 36 But I haue greater
witnesse then the witnesse of Iohn: for
the workes which the Father hath giuen
me to finish, the same workes that I doe,
beare witnesse of me, that the Father sent
me. 37 And the Father himselfe, which
hath sent me, beareth witnesse of me.
Ye haue not heard his voyce at any time,
neither haue ye seene his shape. 38 And
his worde haue you not abiding in you:
for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeued
not. 39 Searche the Scriptures: for in
them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and
they are they which testifie of me. 40 But
ye will not come to me, that ye might
haue life. 41 I receiue not the prayse of
men. 42 But I know you, that ye haue
not the loue of God in you. 43 I am come
in my Fathers Name, and ye receiue me
not: if another shall come in his owne
name, him will ye receiue. 44 How can
ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of
another, and seeke not the honour that
commeth of God alone? 45 Doe not thinke
that I will accuse you to my Father: there
is one that accuseth you, euen Moses, in
whom ye trust. 46 For had ye beleeued
Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for
he wrote of me. 47 But if ye beleeue
not his writings, how shall ye beleeue my
wordes?

1 After these thinges, Iesus went his way
ouer the sea of Galile, which is Tiberias.
2 And a great multitude followed him,
because they sawe his miracles, which
hee did on them that were diseased.
3 Then Iesus went vp into a mountaine,
and there he sate with his disciples. 4 Now
the Passeouer, a feast of the Iewes, wasJohn 6:5
927
neere. 5 Then Iesus lift vp his eyes, and
seeing that a great multitude came vnto
him, hee sayde vnto Philippe, Whence
shall we buy breade, that these might
eate? 6 (And this he sayde to prooue
him: for hee himselfe knewe what he
would doe.) 7 Philippe answered him,
Two hundreth penie worth of bread is
not sufficient for them, that euery one
of them may take a litle. 8 Then saide
vnto him one of his disciples, Andrew,
Simon Peters brother, 9 There is a little
boy heere, which hath fiue barlie loaues,
and two fishes: but what are they among
so many? 10 And Iesus saide, Make ye
people sit downe. (Nowe there was much
grasse in that place.) Then the men sate
downe in nomber, about fiue thousande.
11 And Iesus tooke the bread, and gaue
thanks, and gaue to the disciples, and the
disciples, to them that were set downe:
and likewise of the fishes as much as
they would. 12 And when they were
satisfied, he said vnto his disciples, Gather
vp the broken meat which remaineth,
that nothing be lost. 13 Then they gath-
ered it together, and filled twelue baskets
with the broken meat of the fiue barly
loaues, which remained vnto them that
had eaten. 14 Then the men, when they
had seene the miracle that Iesus did,
saide, This is of a trueth that Prophet that
should come into the world. 15 When
Iesus therfore perceiued that they would
come, and take him to make him a King,
hee departed againe into a mountaine
himselfe alone. 16 When euen was nowe
come, his disciples went downe vnto the
sea, 17 And entred into a shippe, and went
ouer the sea, towardes Capernaum: and
nowe it was darke, and Iesus was not
come to them. 18 And the Sea arose with
a great winde that blewe. 19 And when
they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or
thirtie furlongs, they sawe Iesus walking
on the sea, and drawing neere vnto the
ship: so they were afraide. 20 But he
said vnto them, It is I: be not afraid.
21 Then willingly they receiued him into
the ship, and the ship was by and by
at the lande, whither they went. 22 The
John 6:38
day following, the people which stoode on
the other side of the sea, saw that there
was none other ship there, saue that one,
whereinto his disciples were entred, and
that Iesus went not with his disciples in
the ship, but that his disciples were gone
alone, 23 And that there came other ships
from Tiberias neere vnto the place where
they ate the bread, after the Lord had
giuen thankes. 24 Nowe when the people
sawe that Iesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also tooke shipping, and
came to Capernaum, seeking for Iesus.
25 And when they had founde him on the
other side of the sea, they sayde vnto him,
Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 26 Iesus
answered them; and sayde, Verely, verely
I say vnto you, ye seeke me not because
ye sawe the miracles, but because yee ate
of ye loaues, and were filled. 27 Labour
not for ye meate which perisheth, but for
the meate that endureth vnto euerlasting
life, which the Sonne of man shall giue
vnto you: for him hath God the Father
sealed. 28 Then sayde they vnto him, What
shall we doe, that we might worke the
workes of God? 29 Iesus answered, and
sayde vnto them, This is the woorke of
God, that yee beleeue in him, whome he
hath sent. 30 They sayde therefore vnto
him, What signe shewest thou then, that
we may see it, and beleeue thee? what
doest thou woorke? 31 Our fathers did
eate Manna in the desart, as it is written,
Hee gaue them bread from heauen to
eate. 32 Then Iesus said vnto them, Verely,
verely I say vnto you, Moses gaue you not
that bread from heauen, but my Father
giueth you that true bread from heauen.
33 For the breade of God is hee which
commeth downe from heauen, and giueth
life vnto the world. 34 Then they said vnto
him, Lord, euermore giue vs this bread.
35 And Iesus saide vnto them, I am that
bread of life: he that commeth to me,
shall not hunger, and he that beleeueth
in me, shall neuer thirst. 36 But I said
vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and
beleeue not. 37 All that the Father giueth
me, shall come to mee: and him that
commeth to me, I cast not away. 38 For IJohn 6:39
came downe from heauen, not to do mine
owne wil, but his wil which hath sent me.
39 And this is the Fathers will which hath
sent mee, that of all which hee hath giuen
mee, I should lose nothing, but shoulde
raise it vp againe at the last day. 40 And
this is the will of him that sent mee, that
euery man which seeth the Sonne, and
beleeueth in him, should haue euerlasting
life: and I will raise him vp at the last
day. 41 The Iewes then murmured at him
because hee sayde, I am that bread, which
is come downe from heauen. 42 And they
said, Is not this Iesus that sonne of Ioseph,
whose father and mother wee knowe?
howe then sayth he, I came downe from
heauen? 43 Iesus then answered, and
saide vnto them, Murmure not among
your selues. 44 No man can come to mee,
except the Father, which hath sent mee,
drawe him: and I will raise him vp at the
last day. 45 It is written in the Prophetes,
And they shalbe al taught of God. Euery
man therefore that hath heard, and hath
learned of the Father, commeth vnto
me: 46 Not that any man hath seene the
Father, saue hee which is of God, hee
hath seene the Father. 47 Verely, verely
I say vnto you, hee that beleeueth in me,
hath euerlasting life. 48 I am that bread
of life. 49 Your fathers did eate Manna
in the wildernesse, and are dead. 50 This
is that breade, which commeth downe
from heauen, that hee which eateth of it,
shoulde not die. 51 I am that liuing breade,
which came downe from heauen: if any
man eate of this breade, hee shall liue
for euer: and the bread that I will giue,
is my flesh, which I will giue for the life
of the world. 52 Then the Iewes stroue
among themselues, saying, Howe can this
man giue vs his flesh to eate? 53 Then
Iesus saide vnto them, Verely, verely I say
vnto you, Except yee eate the flesh of the
Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee
haue no life in you. 54 Whosoeuer eateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
eternall life, and I will raise him vp at
the last day. 55 For my flesh is meat in
deede, and my blood is drinke in deede.
56 Hee that eateth my flesh, and drinketh
928
John 7:4
my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
57 As that liuing Father hath sent me, so
liue I by the Father, and he that eateth me,
euen he shall liue by me. 58 This is that
bread which came downe from heauen:
not as your fathers haue eaten Manna,
and are deade. Hee that eateth of this
bread, shall liue for euer. 59 These things
spake he in the Synagogue, as he taught
in Capernaum. 60 Many therefore of his
disciples (when they heard this) sayde,
This is an hard saying: who can heare
it? 61 But Iesus knowing in himselfe, that
his disciples murmured at this, saide vnto
them, Doeth this offend you? 62 What
then if yee should see that Sonne of
man ascend vp where he was before?
63 It is the spirite that quickeneth: the
flesh profiteth nothing: the woordes that
I speake vnto you, are spirite and life.
64 But there are some of you that beleeue
not: for Iesus knewe from the beginning,
which they were that beleeued not, and
who shoulde betray him. 65 And hee
saide, Therefore saide I vnto you, that
no man can come vnto mee, except it be
giuen vnto him of my Father. 66 From
that time, many of his disciples went
backe, and walked no more with him.
67 Then sayde Iesus to the twelue, Will
yee also goe away? 68 Then Simon Peter
answered him, Master, to whome shall we
goe? thou hast the wordes of eternall life:
69 And we beleeue and knowe that thou
art that Christ that Sonne of the liuing
God. 70 Iesus answered them, Haue not
I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a
deuill? 71 Now he spake it of Iudas Iscariot
the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that
shoulde betraie him, though he was one
of the twelue.
1 After
7
these things, Iesus walked in
Galile, and woulde not walke in Iudea:
for the Iewes sought to kill him. 2 Nowe
the Iewes feast of the Tabernacles was
at hande. 3 His brethren therefore sayde
vnto him, Depart hence, and goe into
Iudea, that thy disciples may see thy
woorkes that thou doest. 4 For there is
no man that doeth any thing secretely,John 7:5
929
and hee himselfe seeketh to be famous.
If thou doest these things, shewe thy selfe
to the worlde. 5 For as yet his brethren
beleeued not in him. 6 Then Iesus saide
vnto them, My time is not yet come: but
your time is alway readie. 7 The world can
not hate you: but me it hateth, because I
testifie of it, that the workes thereof are
euill. 8 Go ye vp vnto this feast: I wil not
go vp yet vnto this feast: for my time is
not yet fulfilled. 9 These things he sayde
vnto them, and abode still in Galile. 10 But
assoone as his brethren were gone vp,
then went hee also vp vnto the feast, not
openly, but as it were priuilie. 11 Then the
Iewes sought him at the feast, and saide,
Where is hee? 12 And much murmuring
was there of him among the people. Some
said, He is a good man: other sayd, Nay:
but he deceiueth the people. 13 Howbeit
no man spake openly of him for feare
of the Iewes. 14 Nowe when halfe the
feast was done, Iesus went vp into the
Temple and taught. 15 And the Iewes
marueiled, saving, Howe knoweth this
man the Scriptures, seeing that hee neuer
learned! 16 Iesus answered them, and
saide, My doctrine is not mine, but his
that sent me. 17 If any man will doe
his will, he shall knowe of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speake
of my selfe. 18 Hee that speaketh of
himselfe, seeketh his owne glorie: but
hee that seeketh his glory that sent him,
the same is true, and no vnrighteousnes
is in him. 19 Did not Moses giue you a
Law, and yet none of you keepeth the
lawe? Why goe ye about to kill me?
20 The people answered, and said, Thou
hast a deuil: who goeth about to kill
thee? 21 Iesus answered, and saide to
them, I haue done one worke, and ye all
maruaile. 22 Moses therefore gaue vnto
you circumcision, (not because it is of
Moses, but of the fathers) and ye on the
Sabbath day circumcise a man. 23 If a
man on the Sabbath receiue circumcision,
that the Lawe of Moses should not be
broken, be ye angrie with me, because I
haue made a man euery whit whole on
the Sabbath day? 24 Iudge not according
John 7:42
to the appearance, but iudge righteous
iudgement. 25 Then saide some of them
of Hierusalem, Is not this he, whom they
goe about to kill? 26 And beholde, he
speaketh openly, and they say nothing to
him: doe the rulers know in deede that
this is in deede that Christ? 27 Howbeit
we know this man whence he is: but
when that Christ commeth, no man shall
knowe whence he is. 28 Then cried Iesus
in the Temple as hee taught, saying, Ye
both knowe mee, and knowe whence I
am: yet am I not come of my selfe, but
he that sent me, is true, whome ye knowe
not. 29 But I knowe him: for I am of
him, and he hath sent me. 30 Then they
sought to take him, but no man layde
handes on him, because his houre was
not yet come. 31 Now many of the people
beleeued in him, and said, When that
Christ commeth, will he doe moe miracles
then this man hath done? 32 The Pharises
heard that the people murmured these
thinges of him, and the Pharises, and high
Priestes sent officers to take him. 33 Then
saide Iesus vnto them, Yet am I a little
while with you, and then goe I vnto him
that sent mee. 34 Ye shall seeke me, and
shall not finde me, and where I am, can
ye not come. 35 Then saide the Iewes
amongs themselues, Whither will he goe,
that we shall not finde him? Will he
goe vnto them that are dispersed among
the Grecians, and teache the Grecians?
36 What saying is this that hee saide, Ye
shall seeke mee, and shall not finde mee?
and where I am, cannot ye come? 37 Nowe
in the last and great day of the feast,
Iesus stoode and cried, saying, If any man
thirst, let him come vnto me, and drinke.
38 Hee that beleeueth in mee, as saith
the Scripture, out of his bellie shall flowe
riuers of water of life. 39 (This spake hee
of the Spirite which they that beleeued in
him, should receiue: for the holy Ghost
was not yet giuen, because that Iesus
was not yet glorified.) 40 So many of the
people, when they heard this saying, said,
Of a trueth this is that Prophet. 41 Other
saide, This is that Christ: and some said,
But shall that Christ come out of Galile?
42 Saith not the Scripture that that ChristJohn 7:43
930
shall come of the seede of Dauid, and
out of the towne of Beth-leem, where
Dauid was? 43 So was there dissension
among the people for him. 44 And some
of them would haue taken him, but no
man layde handes on him. 45 Then came
the officers to the hie Priests and Pharises,
and they said vnto them, Why haue ye not
brought him? 46 The officers answered,
Neuer man spake like this man. 47 Then
answered them the Pharises, Are yee also
deceiued? 48 Doeth any of the rulers, or
of the Pharises beleeue in him? 49 But
this people, which know not the Law, are
cursed. 50 Nicodemus said vnto them, (he
that came to Iesus by night, and was one
of them.) 51 Doth our Law iudge a man
before it heare him, and knowe what he
hath done? 52 They answered, and said
vnto him, Art thou also of Galile? Searche
and looke: for out of Galile ariseth no
Prophet. 53 And euery man wet vnto his
owne house.
8
1 And Iesus went vnto the mount of
Oliues, 2 And early in the morning came
againe into the Temple, and all the people
came vnto him, and he sate downe, and
taught them. 3 Then the Scribes, and
the Pharises brought vnto him a woman,
taken in adulterie, and set her in the
middes, 4 And said vnto him, Master, we
foud this woman committing adulterie,
euen in the very acte. 5 Now Moses in
our Law commanded, that such should be
stoned: what sayest thou therefore? 6 And
this they saide to tempt him, that they
might haue, whereof to accuse him. But
Iesus stouped downe, and with his finger
wrote on the groud. 7 And while they
continued asking him, hee lift himselfe
vp, and sayde vnto them, Let him that is
among you without sinne, cast the first
stone at her. 8 And againe hee stouped
downe, and wrote on the ground. 9 And
when they heard it, being accused by
their owne conscience, they went out one
by one, beginning at ye eldest euen to
the last: so Iesus was left alone, and the
woman standing in the mids. 10 When
Iesus had lift vp himselfe againe, and
John 8:27
sawe no man, but the woman, hee saide
vnto her, Woman, where are those thine
accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
11 She said, No man, Lord.
And Iesus
said, Neither do I condemne thee: go and
sinne no more. 12 Then spake Iesus againe
vnto them, saying, I am that light of the
worlde: hee that followeth mee, shall not
walke in darkenes, but shall haue that
light of life. 13 The Pharises therefore
saide vnto him, Thou bearest recorde of
thy selfe: thy recorde is not true. 14 Iesus
answered, and sayde vnto them, Though I
beare recorde of my selfe, yet my recorde
is true: for I know whence I came, and
whither I go: but ye cannot tell whence
I come, and whither I goe. 15 Ye iudge
after the flesh: I iudge no man. 16 And
if I also iudge, my iudgement is true: for
I am not alone, but I, and the Father, that
sent mee. 17 And it is also written in your
Lawe, that the testimonie of two men is
true. 18 I am one that beare witnes of
my selfe, and the Father that sent me,
beareth witnes of me. 19 Then saide they
vnto him, Where is that Father of thine?
Iesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor
that Father of mine. If ye had knowen
me, ye should haue knowen that Father of
mine also. 20 These wordes spake Iesus in
the treasurie, as hee taught in the Temple,
and no man layde handes on him: for his
houre was not yet come. 21 Then saide
Iesus againe vnto them, I goe my way,
and ye shall seeke me, and shall die in
your sinnes, Whither I goe, can ye not
come. 22 Then said the Iewes, Will he kill
himselfe, because he saith, Whither I goe,
can ye not come? 23 And hee saide vnto
them, Ye are from beneath, I am from
aboue: ye are of this world, I am not
of this worlde. 24 I said therefore vnto
you, That ye shall die in your sinnes: for
except ye beleeue, that I am he, ye shall
die in your sinnes. 25 Then saide they vnto
him, Who art thou? And Iesus saide vnto
them, Euen the same thing that I said vnto
you from the beginning. 26 I haue many
things to say, and to iudge of you: but
he that sent me, is true, and the things
that I haue heard of him, those speake I
to the world. 27 They vnderstoode not thatJohn 8:28
hee spake to them of the Father. 28 Then
said Iesus vnto them, When ye haue lift
vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know
that I am he, and that I doe nothing of
my selfe, but as my Father hath taught
me, so I speake these things. 29 For he
that sent me, is with me: the Father hath
not left me alone, because I do alwayes
those things that please him. 30 As hee
spake these thinges, many beleeued in
him. 31 Then saide Iesus to the Iewes
which beleeued in him, If ye continue
in my worde, ye are verely my disciples,
32 And shall know the trueth, and the
33 They
trueth shall make you free.
answered him, Wee be Abrahams seede,
and were neuer bonde to any man: why
sayest thou then, Ye shalbe made free?
34 Iesus answered them, Verely, verely I
say vnto you, that whosoeuer committeth
sinne, is the seruant of sinne. 35 And
the seruant abideth not in the house for
euer: but the Sonne abideth for euer. 36 If
that Sonne therefore shall make you free,
ye shalbe free in deede. 37 I know that
ye are Abrahams seede, but yee seeke
to kill mee, because my worde hath no
place in you. 38 I speake that which
I haue seene with my Father: and ye
doe that which ye haue seene with your
father. 39 They answered, and saide vnto
him, Abraham is our father. Iesus said
vnto them, If ye were Abrahams children,
ye woulde doe the workes of Abraham.
40 But nowe ye goe about to kill mee, a
man that haue told you the trueth, which I
haue heard of God: this did not Abraham.
41 Ye do the workes of your father. Then
said they to him, We are not borne of
fornication: we haue one Father, which is
God. 42 Therefore Iesus sayde vnto them,
If God were your Father, then woulde ye
loue mee: for I proceeded foorth, and
came from God, neither came I of my
selfe, but he sent me. 43 Why doe ye not
vnderstande my talke? because ye cannot
heare my worde. 44 Ye are of your father
the deuill, and the lustes of your father
ye will doe: hee hath bene a murtherer
from the beginning, and abode not in the
trueth, because there is no trueth in him.
931
John 9:3
When hee speaketh a lie, then speaketh
hee of his owne: for he is a liar, and the
father thereof. 45 And because I tell you
the trueth, yee beleeue me not. 46 Which
of you can rebuke me of sinne? and if I
say the trueth, why do ye not beleeue me?
47 He that is of God, heareth Gods wordes:
yee therefore heare them not, because ye
are not of God. 48 Then answered the
Iewes, and said vnto him, Say we not well
that thou art a Samaritane, and hast a
deuil? 49 Iesus answered, I haue not a
deuil, but I honour my Father, and ye
haue dishonoured me. 50 And I seeke
not mine owne praise: but there is one
that seeketh it, and iudgeth. 51 Verely,
verely I say vnto you, If a man keepe my
word, he shall neuer see death. 52 Then
said the Iewes to him, Now know we
that thou hast a deuill. Abraham is dead,
and the Prophets: and thou sayest, If a
man keepe my worde, he shall neuer taste
of death. 53 Art thou greater then our
father Abraham, which is dead? and the
Prophets are dead: whome makest thou
thy selfe? 54 Iesus answered, If I honour
my selfe, mine honour is nothing worth:
it is my Father that honoureth me, whome
ye say, that hee is your God. 55 Yet ye haue
not knowen him: but I knowe him, and if
I should say I know him not, I should be
a liar like vnto you: but I knowe him, and
keepe his worde. 56 Your father Abraham
reioyced to see my day, and he sawe it,
and was glad. 57 Then sayd ye Iewes vnto
him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeere olde, and
hast thou seene Abraham? 58 Iesus sayd
vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you,
before Abraham was, I am. 59 Then tooke
they vp stones, to cast at him, but Iesus
hid himselfe, and went out of the Temple:
And hee passed through the middes of
them, and so went his way.
1 And
9
as Iesus passed by, he sawe a
man which was blinde from his birth.
2 And his disciples asked him, saying,
Master, who did sinne, this man, or his
parents, that he was borne blinde? 3 Iesus
answered, Neither hath this man sinned,
nor his parents, but that the workes ofJohn 9:4
932
God should be shewed on him. 4 I must
worke the workes of him that sent me,
while it is day: the night commeth when
no man can worke. 5 As long as I am in
the world, I am the light of the world.
6 Assoone as he had thus spoken, he
spat on the ground, and made clay of
the spettle, and anointed the eyes of the
blinde with the clay, 7 And sayd vnto him,
Go wash in the poole of Siloam (which is
by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way
therefore, and washed, and came againe
seeing. 8 Nowe the neighbours and they
that had seene him before, when he was
blinde, sayd, Is not this he that sate and
begged? 9 Some said, This is he: and
other sayd, He is like him: but he himselfe
sayd, I am he. 10 Therefore they sayd
vnto him, Howe were thine eyes opened?
11 He answered, and sayd, The man that
is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed
mine eyes, and sayde vnto me, Goe to
the poole of Siloam and wash. So I went
and washed, and receiued sight. 12 Then
they sayd vnto him, Where is he? He
sayd, I can not tell. 13 They brought to the
Pharises him that was once blinde. 14 And
it was the Sabbath day, when Iesus made
the clay, and opened his eyes. 15 Then
againe the Pharises also asked him, how
he had receiued sight. And hee sayd vnto
them, He layd clay vpon mine eyes, and I
washed, and doe see. 16 Then said some
of the Pharises, This man is not of God,
because he keepeth not the Sabbath day.
Others sayd, Howe can a man that is a
sinner, doe such miracles? and there was
a dissension among them. 17 Then spake
they vnto the blinde againe, What sayest
thou of him, because he hath opened
thine eyes? And he sayd, He is a Prophet.
18 Then the Iewes did not beleeue him
(that he had bene blinde, and receiued his
sight) vntill they had called the parents of
him that had receiued sight. 19 And they
asked them, saying, Is this your sonne,
whom ye say was borne blinde? How
doeth he nowe see then? 20 His parents
answered them, and sayd, We know that
this is our sonne, and that he was borne
blinde: 21 But by what meanes hee nowe
John 9:39
seeth, we know not: or who hath opened
his eyes, can we not tell: he is olde
ynough: aske him: hee shall answere
for himselfe. 22 These wordes spake his
parents, because they feared the Iewes:
for the Iewes had ordeined already, that
if any man did confesse that he was
Christ, he should be excommunicate out
of the Synagogue. 23 Therefore sayde his
parents, Hee is olde ynough: aske him.
24 Then againe called they the man that
had bene blinde, and sayd vnto him, Giue
glory vnto God: we know that this man
is a sinner. 25 Then he answered, and
sayd, Whether hee be a sinner or no, I
can not tell: one thing I know, that I was
blinde, and nowe I see. 26 Then sayd they
to him againe, What did he to thee? howe
opened he thine eyes? 27 Hee answered
them, I haue tolde you already, and yee
haue not heard it: wherefore would yee
heare it againe? will yee also be his
disciples? 28 Then reuiled they him, and
sayd, Be thou his disciple: we be Moses
disciples. 29 We know that God spake
with Moses: but this man we know not
from whence he is. 30 The man answered,
and sayde vnto them, Doutlesse, this is
a marueilous thing, that ye know not
whence he is, and yet he hath opened
mine eyes. 31 Now we know that God
heareth not sinners: but if any man be
a worshipper of God, and doeth his will,
him heareth he. 32 Since the world began,
was it not heard, that any man opened
the eyes of one that was borne blinde.
33 If this man were not of God, hee could
haue done nothing. 34 They answered,
and sayd vnto him, Thou art altogether
borne in sinnes, and doest thou teach
vs? so they cast him out. 35 Iesus heard
that they had cast him out: and when
he had found him, he sayd vnto him,
Doest thou beleeue in the Sonne of God?
36 He answered, and sayd, Who is he,
Lord, that I might beleeue in him? 37 And
Iesus sayd vnto him, Both thou hast seene
him, and he it is that talketh with thee.
38 Then he sayd, Lord, I beleeue, and
worshipped him. 39 And Iesus sayd, I am
come vnto iudgement into this world, thatJohn 9:40
933
they which see not, might see: and that
they which see, might be made blinde.
40 And some of the Pharises which were
with him, heard these things, and sayd
vnto him, Are we blinde also? 41 Iesus
sayd vnto them, If ye were blinde, ye
should not haue sinne: but nowe ye say,
We see: therefore your sinne remaineth.
1 Verely,
10
verely I say vnto you, Hee
that entreth not in by the doore into the
sheepefolde, but climeth vp another way,
he is a theefe and a robber. 2 But he that
goeth in by the doore, is the shepheard of
the sheepe. 3 To him the porter openeth,
and the sheepe heare his voyce, and he
calleth his owne sheepe by name, and
leadeth them out. 4 And when hee hath
sent foorth his owne sheepe, he goeth
before them, and the sheepe follow him:
for they know his voyce. 5 And they
will not follow a stranger, but they flee
from him: for they know not the voyce of
strangers. 6 This parable spake Iesus vnto
them: but they vnderstoode not what
things they were which he spake vnto
them. 7 Then sayd Iesus vnto them againe,
Verely, verely I say vnto you, I am that
doore of the sheepe. 8 All, that euer came
before me, are theeues and robbers: but
the sheepe did not heare them. 9 I am
that doore: by me if any man enter in,
he shall be saued, and shall go in, and
go out, and finde pasture. 10 The theefe
commeth not, but for to steale, and to
kill, and to destroy: I am come that they
might haue life, and haue it in abundance.
11 I am that good shepheard: that good
shepheard giueth his life for his sheepe.
12 But an hireling, and hee which is not
the shepheard, neither the sheepe are his
owne, seeth the wolfe comming, and hee
leaueth the sheepe, and fleeth, and the
wolfe catcheth them, and scattreth the
sheepe. 13 So the hireling fleeth, because
he is an hireling, and careth not for the
sheepe. 14 I am that good shepheard, and
knowe mine, and am knowen of mine.
15 As the Father knoweth me, so know I
the Father: and I lay downe my life for
John 10:36
my sheepe. 16 Other sheepe I haue also,
which are not of this folde: them also
must I bring, and they shall heare my
voyce: and there shalbe one sheepefolde,
and one shepheard. 17 Therefore doeth
my Father loue me, because I lay downe
my life, that I might take it againe. 18 No
man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe
of my selfe: I haue power to lay it downe,
and haue power to take it againe: this
commandement haue I receiued of my
Father. 19 Then there was a dissension
againe among the Iewes for these sayings,
20 And many of them sayd, He hath a
deuill, and is mad: why heare ye him?
21 Other sayd, These are not the wordes
of him that hath a deuill: can the deuill
open the eyes of the blinde? 22 And it was
at Hierusalem the feast of the Dedication,
and it was winter. 23 And Iesus walked in
the Temple, in Salomons porche. 24 Then
came the Iewes round about him, and
sayd vnto him, Howe long doest thou
make vs dout? If thou be that Christ, tell
vs plainely. 25 Iesus answered them, I
tolde you, and ye beleeue not: the workes
that I doe in my Fathers Name, they beare
witnes of me. 26 But ye beleeue not:
for ye are not of my sheepe, as I sayd
vnto you. 27 My sheepe heare my voyce,
and I knowe them, and they follow me,
28 And I giue vnto them eternall life, and
they shall neuer perish, neither shall any
plucke them out of mine hand. 29 My
Father which gaue them me, is greater
then all, and none is able to take them
out of my Fathers hand. 30 I and my
Father are one. 31 Then ye Iewes againe
tooke vp stones, to stone him. 32 Iesus
answered them, Many good workes haue
I shewed you from my Father: for which
of these workes doe ye stone me? 33 The
Iewes answered him, saying, For the
good worke we stone thee not, but for
blasphemie, and that thou being a man,
makest thy selfe God. 34 Iesus answered
them, Is it not written in your Lawe,
I sayd, Ye are gods? 35 If hee called
them gods, vnto whome the worde of
God was giuen, and the Scripture cannot
be broken, 36 Say ye of him, whome theJohn 10:37
934
Father hath sanctified, and sent into the
worlde, Thou blasphemest, because I said,
I am the Sonne of God? 37 If I doe not
the workes of my Father, beleeue me not.
38 But if I doe, then though ye beleeue not
mee, yet beleeue the workes, that ye may
knowe and beleeue, that the Father is in
me, and I in him. 39 Againe they went
about to take him: but he escaped out of
their handes, 40 And went againe beyonde
Iordan, into the place where Iohn first
baptized, and there abode. 41 And many
resorted vnto him, and saide, Iohn did no
miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake
of this man, were true. 42 And many
beleeued in him there.
11
1 And a certaine man was sicke, named
Lazarus of Bethania, the towne of Marie,
and her sister Martha. 2 (And it was
that Mary which anointed the Lord with
oyntment, and wiped his feete with her
heare, whose brother Lazarus was sicke.)
3 Therefore his sisters sent vnto him,
saying, Lord, beholde, he whome thou
louest, is sicke. 4 When Iesus heard it, he
saide, This sickenes is not vnto death, but
for the glorie of God, that the Sonne of
God might be glorified thereby. 5 Nowe
Iesus loued Martha and her sister, and
Lazarus. 6 And after he had heard that he
was sicke, yet abode hee two dayes still in
the same place where he was. 7 Then after
that, said he to his disciples, Let vs goe
into Iudea againe. 8 The disciples saide
vnto him, Master, the Iewes lately sought
to stone thee, and doest thou goe thither
againe? 9 Iesus answered, Are there not
twelue houres in the day? If a man walke
in the day, hee stumbleth not, because he
seeth the light of this world. 10 But if a
man walke in the night, hee stumbleth,
because there is no light in him. 11 These
things spake he, and after, he said vnto
them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth: but
I goe to wake him vp. 12 Then said his
disciples, Lord, if he sleepe, he shalbe
safe. 13 Howbeit, Iesus spake of his death:
but they thought that he had spoken of the
naturall sleepe. 14 Then saide Iesus vnto
them plainely, Lazarus is dead. 15 And
John 11:34
I am glad for your sakes, that I was not
there, that ye may beleeue: but let vs go
vnto him. 16 Then saide Thomas (which is
called Didymus) vnto his felow disciples,
Let vs also goe, that we may die with
him. 17 Then came Iesus, and found
that he had lien in the graue foure dayes
alreadie. 18 (Nowe Bethania was neere
vnto Hierusalem, about fifteene furlongs
off.) 19 And many of ye Iewes were
come to Martha and Marie to comfort
them for their brother. 20 Then Martha,
when shee heard that Iesus was comming,
went to meete him: but Mary sate still
in the house. 21 Then said Martha vnto
Iesus, Lord, if thou hadst bene here, my
brother had not bene dead. 22 But now
I know also, that whatsoeuer thou askest
of God, God will giue it thee. 23 Iesus said
vnto her, Thy brother shall rise againe.
24 Martha said vnto him, I know that he
shall rise againe in the resurrection at
the last day. 25 Iesus saide vnto her,
I am the resurrection and the life: he
that beleeueth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he liue. 26 And whosoeuer
liueth, and beleeueth in me, shall neuer
die: Beleeuest thou this? 27 She said
vnto him, Yea, Lord, I beleeue that thou
art that Christ that Sonne of God, which
should come into the world. 28 And when
she had so saide, she went her way, and
called Mary her sister secretly, saying,
The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
29 And when she heard it, shee arose
quickly, and came vnto him. 30 For Iesus
was not yet come into the towne, but
was in the place where Martha met him.
31 The Iewes then which were with her in
the house, and comforted her, when they
sawe Marie, that she rose vp hastily, and
went out, folowed her, saying, She goeth
vnto the graue, to weepe there. 32 Then
when Mary was come where Iesus was,
and sawe him, she fell downe at his feete,
saying vnto him, Lord, if thou haddest
bene here, my brother had not bene dead.
33 When Iesus therefore saw her weepe,
and the Iewes also weepe which came
with her, hee groned in the spirit, and
was troubled in himselfe, 34 And saide,
Where haue ye layde him? They said vntoJohn 11:35
935
him, Lord, come and see. 35 And Iesus
wept. 36 Then saide the Iewes, Beholde,
how he loued him. 37 And some of them
saide, Coulde not he, which opened the
eyes of the blinde, haue made also, that
this man should not haue died? 38 Iesus
therefore againe groned in himselfe, and
came to the graue. And it was a caue,
and a stone was layde vpon it. 39 Iesus
saide, Take ye away the stone. Martha
the sister of him that was dead, said vnto
him, Lord, he stinketh alreadie: for he
hath bene dead foure dayes. 40 Iesus saide
vnto her, Saide I not vnto thee, that if
thou diddest beleeue, thou shouldest see
the glorie of God? 41 Then they tooke
away the stone from the place where the
dead was layde. And Iesus lift vp his eyes,
and saide, Father, I thanke thee, because
thou hast heard me. 42 I knowe that
thou hearest me alwayes, but because
of the people that stand by, I said it,
that they may beleeue, that thou hast
sent me. 43 As hee had spoken these
things, hee cried with a loude voyce,
Lazarus, come foorth. 44 Then he that was
dead, came forth, bound hande and foote
with bandes, and his face was bound
with a napkin. Iesus said vnto them,
Loose him, and let him goe. 45 Then
many of the Iewes, which came to Mary,
and had seene the thinges, which Iesus
did, beleeued in him. 46 But some of
them went their way to the Pharises, and
told them what things Iesus had done.
47 Then gathered the hie Priests, and
the Pharises a councill, and said, What
shall we doe? For this man doeth many
miracles. 48 If we let him thus alone,
all men will beleeue in him, and the
Romanes will come and take away both
our place, and the nation. 49 Then one
of them named Caiaphas, which was the
hie Priest that same yere, said vnto them,
Ye perceiue nothing at all, 50 Nor yet doe
you consider that it is expedient for vs,
that one man die for the people, and that
the whole nation perish not. 51 This spake
hee not of himselfe: but being hie Priest
that same yere, he prophecied that Iesus
should die for that nation: 52 And not
for that nation onely, but that he shoulde
John 12:11
gather together in one the children of
God, which were scattered. 53 Then from
that day foorth they consulted together,
to put him to death. 54 Iesus therefore
walked no more openly among the Iewes,
but went thence vnto a countrey neere to
the wildernes, into a citie called Ephraim,
and there continued with his disciples.
55 And the Iewes Passeouer was at hande,
and many went out of the countrey vp
to Hierusalem before the Passeouer, to
purifie themselues. 56 Then sought they
for Iesus, and spake among themselues,
as they stoode in the Temple, What thinke
ye, that he cometh not to the feast? 57 Now
both the high Priestes and the Pharises
had giuen a commandement, that if any
man knew where he were, he should
shew it, that they might take him.
1 Then
12
Iesus, sixe dayes before the
Passeouer, came to Bethania, where
Lazarus was, who died, whom he had
raised from the dead. 2 There they made
him a supper, and Martha serued: but
Lazarus was one of them that sate at the
table with him. 3 Then tooke Mary a
pound of oyntment of Spikenarde very
costly, and anoynted Iesus feete, and
wiped his feete with her heare, and the
house was filled with the sauour of the
oyntment. 4 Then said one of his disciples,
euen Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, which
should betray him: 5 Why was not this
oyntment sold for three hundreth pence,
and giuen to the poore? 6 Nowe he said
this, not that he cared for the poore, but
because hee was a theefe, and had the
bagge, and bare that which was giuen.
7 Then said Iesus, Let her alone: against
the day of my burying she kept it. 8 For
the poore alwayes yee haue with you, but
me ye shall not haue alwayes. 9 Then
much people of the Iewes knewe that
hee was there: and they came, not for
Iesus sake onely, but that they might see
Lazarus also, whome he had raysed from
the dead. 10 The hie Priestes therefore
consulted, that they might put Lazarus
to death also, 11 Because that for hisJohn 12:12
936
sake many of the Iewes went away, and
beleeued in Iesus. 12 On the morowe a
great multitude that were come to the
feast, when they heard that Iesus should
come to Hierusalem, 13 Tooke branches
of palme trees, and went foorth to meete
him, and cried, Hosanna, Blessed is the
King of Israel that commeth in the Name
of the Lord. 14 And Iesus found a yong
asse, and sate thereon, as it is written,
15 Feare not, daughter of Sion: behold,
thy King commeth sitting on an asses
colte. 16 But his disciples vnderstoode not
these thinges at the first: but when Iesus
was glorified, then remembred they, that
these thinges were written of him, and
that they had done these things vnto him.
17 The people therefore that was with him,
bare witnesse that hee called Lazarus out
of the graue, and raised him from the
dead. 18 Therefore mette him the people
also, because they heard that he had done
this miracle. 19 And the Pharises said
among themselues, Perceiue ye howe ye
preuaile nothing? Beholde, the worlde
goeth after him. 20 Nowe there were
certaine Greekes among them that came
vp to worship at the feast. 21 And they
came to Philippe, which was of Bethsaida
in Galile, and desired him, saying, Syr, we
would see that Iesus. 22 Philippe came
and tolde Andrew: and againe Andrew
and Philippe tolde Iesus. 23 And Iesus
answered them, saying, The houre is
come, that the Sonne of man must bee
glorified. 24 Verely, verely I say vnto
you, Except the wheate corne fall into the
grounde and die, it bideth alone: but if it
die, it bringeth foorth much fruite. 25 He
that loueth his life, shall lose it, and he
that hateth his life in this world, shall
keepe it vnto life eternall. 26 If any man
serue me, let him follow me: for where I
am, there shall also my seruant be: and
if any man serue me, him will my Father
honour. 27 Now is my soule troubled: and
what shall I say? Father, saue me from
this houre: but therefore came I vnto
this houre. 28 Father, glorifie thy Name.
Then came there a voyce from heauen,
saying, I haue both glorified it, and will
John 12:47
glorifie it againe. 29 Then saide the people
that stoode by, and heard, that it was a
thunder: other said, An Angel spake to
him. 30 Iesus answered, and said, This
voyce came not because of me, but for
your sakes. 31 Now is the iudgement of
this world: nowe shall the prince of this
world be cast out. 32 And I, if I were lift
vp from the earth, will drawe all men
vnto me. 33 Nowe this sayd he, signifying
what death he should die. 34 The people
answered him, We haue heard out of the
Law, that that Christ bideth for euer: and
howe sayest thou, that that Sonne of man
must be lift vp? Who is that Sonne of
man? 35 Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Yet
a litle while is the light with you: walke
while ye haue that light, lest the darkenes
come vpon you: for hee that walketh in
the darke, knoweth not whither he goeth.
36 While ye haue that light, beleeue in
that light, that ye may be the children of
the light. These things spake Iesus, and
departed, and hid himselfe from them.
37 And though he had done so many
miracles before them, yet beleeued they
not on him, 38 That the saying of Esaias
the Prophete might be fulfilled, that he
sayd, Lord, who beleeued our report?
and to whome is the arme of the Lord
reueiled? 39 Therefore could they not
beleeue, because that Esaias saith againe,
40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hard-
ened their heart, that they shoulde not
see with their eyes, nor vnderstand with
their heart, and should be conuerted, and
I should heale them. 41 These things
sayd Esaias when he sawe his glory, and
spake of him. 42 Neuertheles, euen among
the chiefe rulers, many beleeued in him:
but because of the Pharises they did not
confesse him, least they should be cast out
of the Synagogue. 43 For they loued the
prayse of men, more then the prayse of
God. 44 And Iesus cryed, and sayd, He that
beleeueth in me, beleeueth not in me, but
in him that sent me. 45 And he that seeth
me, seeth him that sent me. 46 I am come
a light into the world, that whosoeuer
beleeueth in me, should not abide in
darkenes. 47 And if any man heare myJohn 12:48
937
wordes, and beleeue not, I iudge him not:
for I came not to iudge the world, but
to saue the world. 48 He that refuseth
me, and receiueth not my wordes, hath
one that iudgeth him: the worde that I
haue spoken, it shall iudge him in the
last day. 49 For I haue not spoken of my
selfe: but the Father which sent me, hee
gaue me a commandement what I should
say, and what I should speake. 50 And
I knowe that his commandement is life
euerlasting: the thinges therefore that I
speake, I speake them so as the Father
sayde vnto me.
13
Nowe before the feast of the
Passeouer, when Iesus knewe that his
houre was come, that he should depart
out of this world vnto the Father,
forasmuch as he loued his owne which
were in the world, vnto the end he loued
them. 2 And when supper was done (and
that the deuill had now put in the heart
of Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne, to betray
him) 3 Iesus knowing that the Father
had giuen all things into his hands, and
that he was come forth from God, and
went to God, 4 He riseth from supper,
and layeth aside his vpper garments,
and tooke a towel, and girded himselfe.
5 After that, hee powred water into a
basen, and began to wash the disciples
feete, and to wipe them with the towell,
wherewith he was girded. 6 Then came
he to Simon Peter, who sayd to him,
Lord, doest thou wash my feete? 7 Iesus
answered and sayd vnto him, What I doe,
thou knowest not nowe: but thou shalt
knowe it hereafter. 8 Peter said vnto him,
Thou shalt neuer wash my feete. Iesus
answered him, If I wash thee not, thou
shalt haue no part with me. 9 Simon Peter
sayd vnto him, Lord, not my feete onely,
but also the hands and the head. 10 Iesus
sayd to him, He that is washed, needeth
not, saue to wash his feete, but is cleane
euery whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.
11 For hee knewe who should betray him:
therefore sayd he, Ye are not all cleane.
12 So after he had washed their feete,
and had taken his garments, and was set
1
John 13:31
downe againe, he sayd vnto them, Knowe
ye what I haue done to you? 13 Ye call me
Master, and Lord, and ye say well: for so
am I. 14 If I then your Lord, and Master,
haue washed your feete, ye also ought to
wash one an others feete. 15 For I haue
giuen you an example, that ye should doe,
euen as I haue done to you. 16 Verely,
verely I say vnto you, The seruant is
not greater then his master, neither the
ambassadour greater then he that sent
him. 17 If ye know these things, blessed
are ye, if ye doe them. 18 I speake not of
you all: I know whom I haue chosen: but
it is that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
He that eateth bread with me, hath lift vp
his heele against me. 19 From henceforth
tell I you before it come, that when it
is come to passe, ye might beleeue that I
am he. 20 Verely, verely I say vnto you, If I
send any, he that receiueth him, receiueth
me, and hee that receiueth me, receiueth
him that sent me. 21 When Iesus had sayd
these things, he was troubled in the Spirit,
and testified, and said, Verely, verely I
say vnto you, that one of you shall betray
me. 22 Then the disciples looked one on
another, doubting of whom he spake.
23 Nowe there was one of his disciples,
which leaned on Iesus bosome, whom
Iesus loued. 24 To him beckened therefore
Simon Peter, that he should aske who it
was of whom he spake. 25 He then, as he
leaned on Iesus breast, saide vnto him,
Lord, who is it? 26 Iesus answered, He it
is, to whome I shall giue a soppe, when
I haue dipt it: and hee wet a soppe, and
gaue it to Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne.
27 And after the soppe, Satan entred into
him. Then sayd Iesus vnto him, That
thou doest, doe quickly. 28 But none
of them that were at table, knew, for
what cause he spake it vnto him. 29 For
some of them thought because Iudas had
the bag, that Iesus had sayd vnto him,
Buy those things that we haue neede
of against ye feast: or that he should
giue some thing to the poore. 30 Assoone
then as he had receiued the soppe, he
went immediately out, and it was night.
31 When hee was gone out, Iesus sayd,John 13:32
938
Nowe is the Sonne of man glorified, and
God is glorified in him. 32 If God be
glorified in him, God shall also glorifie
him in himselfe, and shall straightway
glorifie him. 33 Litle children, yet a litle
while am I with you: ye shall seeke me,
but as I sayde vnto the Iewes, Whither
I goe, can ye not come: also to you say
I nowe, 34 A newe commandement giue
I vnto you, that ye loue one another:
as I haue loued you, that ye also loue
one another. 35 By this shall all men
knowe that ye are my disciples, if ye
haue loue one to another. 36 Simon Peter
said vnto him, Lord, whither goest thou?
Iesus answered him, Whither I goe, thou
canst not follow me nowe: but thou shalt
follow me afterward. 37 Peter sayd vnto
him, Lord, why can I not follow thee
now? I will lay downe my life for thy
sake. 38 Iesus answered him, Wilt thou
lay downe thy life for my sake? Verely,
verely I say vnto thee, The cocke shall not
crowe, till thou haue denied me thrise.
1 Let
14
not your heart be troubled: ye
beleeue in God, beleeue also in me. 2 In
my Fathers house are many dwelling
places: if it were not so, I would haue
tolde you: I go to prepare a place for you.
3 And if I go to prepare a place for you,
I wil come againe, and receiue you vnto
my selfe, that where I am, there may ye be
also. 4 And whither I go, ye know, and the
way ye knowe. 5 Thomas sayd vnto him,
Lord, we know not whither thou goest:
how can we then know ye way? 6 Iesus
sayd vnto him, I am that Way, and that
Trueth, and that Life. No man commeth
vnto the Father, but by me. 7 If ye had
knowen mee, ye should haue knowen
my Father also: and from henceforth ye
know him, and haue seene him. 8 Philippe
sayd vnto him, Lord, shewe vs thy Father,
and it sufficeth vs. 9 Iesus sayd vnto
him, I haue bene so long time with you,
and hast thou not knowen mee, Philippe?
he that hath seene me, hath seene my
Father: how then sayest thou, Shewe vs
thy Father? 10 Beleeuest thou not, that
John 14:27
I am in the Father, and the Father is in
me? The wordes that I speake vnto you,
I speake not of my selfe: but the Father
that dwelleth in me, he doeth the workes.
11 Beleeue me, that I am in the Father, and
the Father is in me: at the least, beleeue
me for the very workes sake. 12 Verely,
verely I say vnto you, he that beleeueth
in me, the workes that I doe, hee shall
doe also, and greater then these shall he
doe: for I goe vnto my Father. 13 And
whatsoeuer ye aske in my Name, that will
I doe, that the Father may be glorified in
the Sonne. 14 If ye shall aske any thing
in my Name, I will doe it. 15 If ye loue
me, keepe my comandements, 16 And I
wil pray the Father, and he shall giue
you another Comforter, that he may abide
with you for euer, 17 Euen the Spirit of
trueth, whome the world can not receiue,
because it seeth him not, neither knoweth
him: but ye knowe him: for he dwelleth
with you, and shalbe in you. 18 I will not
leaue you fatherles: but I will come to
you. 19 Yet a litle while, and the world
shall see me no more, but ye shall see
me: because I liue, ye shall liue also.
20 At that day shall ye knowe that I am
in my Father, and you in me, and I in
you. 21 He that hath my commandements,
and keepeth them, is he that loueth me:
and he that loueth me, shall be loued of
my Father: and I will loue him, and wil
shewe mine owne selfe to him. 22 Iudas
sayd vnto him (not Iscariot) Lord, what is
the cause that thou wilt shewe thy selfe
vnto vs, and not vnto the world? 23 Iesus
answered, and sayd vnto him, If any man
loue me, he will keepe my worde, and
my Father will loue him, and we wil
come vnto him, and wil dwell with him.
24 He that loueth me not, keepeth not my
wordes, and the worde which ye heare,
is not mine, but the Fathers which sent
me. 25 These things haue I spoken vnto
you, being present with you. 26 But the
Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom
the Father wil send in my Name, he shall
teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, which I haue tolde
you. 27 Peace I leaue with you: my peaceJohn 14:28
939
I giue vnto you: not as the worlde giueth,
giue I vnto you. Let not your heart be
troubled, nor feare. 28 Ye haue heard
howe I saide vnto you, I goe away, and
will come vnto you. If ye loued me, ye
would verely reioyce, because I said, I goe
vnto the Father: for the Father is greater
then I. 29 And nowe haue I spoken vnto
you, before it come, that when it is come
to passe, ye might beleeue. 30 Hereafter
will I not speake many things vnto you:
for the prince of this world commeth, and
hath nought in me. 31 But it is that the
world may knowe that I loue my Father:
and as the Father hath commanded me,
so I doe. Arise, let vs goe hence.
15
1 I Am that true vine,
John 16:2
man, when any man bestoweth his life
for his friendes. 14 Ye are my friendes,
if ye doe whatsoeuer I commaund you.
15 Henceforth call I you not seruants: for
the seruant knoweth not what his master
doeth: but I haue called you friends:
for all things that I haue heard of my
Father, haue I made knowen to you. 16 Ye
haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen
you, and ordeined you, that ye goe and
bring foorth fruite, and that your fruite
remaine, that whatsoeuer ye shall aske
of the Father in my Name, he may giue
it you. 17 These things commaund I you,
that ye loue one another. 18 If the worlde
hate you, ye knowe that it hated me
before you. 19 If ye were of the worlde, the
world woulde loue his owne: but because
ye are not of ye world, but I haue chosen
you out of the world, therefore the world
hateth you. 20 Remember the word that I
said vnto you, The seruant is not greater
then his master. If they haue persecuted
me, they will persecute you also: if they
haue kept my worde, they will also keepe
yours. 21 But all these things will they
doe vnto you for my Names sake, because
they haue not knowen him that sent me.
22 If I had not come and spoken vnto them,
they shoulde not haue had sinne: but
nowe haue they no cloke for their sinne.
23 He that hateth me, hateth my Father
also. 24 If I had not done workes among
them which none other man did, they had
not had sinne: but nowe haue they both
seene, and haue hated both me, and my
Father. 25 But it is that the worde might
be fulfilled, that is written in their Lawe,
They hated me without a cause. 26 But
when that Comforter shall come, whom I
will send vnto you from the Father, euen
the Spirit of trueth, which proceedeth of
the Father, he shall testifie of me. 27 And
ye shall witnesse also, because ye haue
bene with me from the beginning.
and my Father
is that husband man.
branch
that beareth not fruite in me, he taketh
away: and euery one that beareth fruite,
he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more
fruite. 3 Nowe are ye cleane through the
worde, which I haue spoken vnto you.
4 Abide in me, and I in you: as the branche
cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it
abide in the vine, no more can ye, except
ye abide in me. 5 I am that vine: ye are the
branches: he that abideth in me, and I in
him, the same bringeth forth much fruite:
for without me can ye doe nothing. 6 If
a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branche, and withereth: and men
gather them, and cast them into the fire,
and they burne. 7 If ye abide in me, and
my wordes abide in you, aske what ye wil,
and it shalbe done to you. 8 Herein is
my Father glorified, that ye beare much
fruite, and be made my disciples. 9 As
the father hath loued me, so haue I
loued you: continue in that my loue.
10 If ye shall keepe my commandements,
ye shall abide in my loue, as I haue
kept my Fathers commandements, and
abide in his loue. 11 These things haue
I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might
16
1 These thinges haue I saide vnto you,
remaine in you, and that your ioy might
be full. 12 This is my commandement, that ye should not be offended. 2 They
that ye loue one another, as I haue loued shall excommunicate you: yea, the time
you. 13 Greater loue then this hath no shall come, that whosoeuer killeth you,
2 EueryJohn 16:3
940
will thinke that he doeth God seruice.
3 And these things will they doe vnto you,
because they haue not knowen ye Father,
nor me. 4 But these things haue I tolde
you, that when the houre shall come, ye
might remember, that I tolde you them.
And these things said I not vnto you from
ye beginning, because I was with you.
5 But now I go my way to him that sent
me, and none of you asketh me, Whither
goest thou? 6 But because I haue saide
these thinges vnto you, your hearts are
full of sorowe. 7 Yet I tell you the trueth,
It is expedient for you that I goe away: for
if I goe not away, that Comforter will not
come vnto you: but if I depart, I will send
him vnto you. 8 And when he is come,
he will reproue the worlde of sinne, and
of righteousnesse, and of iudgement. 9 Of
sinne, because they beleeued not in me:
10 Of righteousnesse, because I goe to my
Father, and ye shall see me no more: 11 Of
iudgement, because the prince of this
world is iudged. 12 I haue yet many things
to say vnto you, but ye cannot beare them
nowe. 13 Howbeit, when he is come which
is the Spirit of trueth, he will leade you
into all trueth: for he shall not speake of
himselfe, but whatsoeuer he shall heare,
shall he speake, and he will shew you the
things to come. 14 He shall glorifie me:
for he shall receiue of mine, and shall
shewe it vnto you. 15 All thinges that the
Father hath, are mine: therefore said I,
that he shall take of mine, and shewe it
vnto you. 16 A litle while, and ye shall
not see me: and againe a litle while, and
ye shall see me: for I goe to the Father.
17 Then said some of his disciples among
them selues, What is this that he saieth
vnto vs, A litle while, and ye shall not
see me, and againe, a litle while, and ye
shall see me, and, For I goe to the Father.
18 They said therefore, What is this that
he saith, A litle while? we know not what
he sayeth. 19 Now Iesus knew that they
would aske him, and said vnto them, Doe
ye enquire among your selues, of that I
said, A litle while, and ye shall not see me:
and againe, a litle while, and yee shall
see me? 20 Verely, verely I say vnto you,
John 17:1
that ye shall weepe and lament, and the
worlde shall reioyce: and ye shall sorowe,
but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioye.
21 A woman when she traueileth, hath
sorowe, because her houre is come: but
assoone as she is deliuered of the childe,
she remembreth no more the anguish, for
ioy that a man is borne into the world.
22 And ye nowe therefore are in sorowe:
but I will see you againe, and your hearts
shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man
take from you. 23 And in that day shall
ye aske me nothing. Verely, verely I say
vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the
Father in my Name, he will giue it you.
24 Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my
Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that
your ioye may be full. 25 These things
haue I spoken vnto you in parables: but
the time will come, when I shall no more
speake to you in parables: but I shall
shew you plainely of the Father. 26 At
that day shall ye aske in my Name, and
I say not vnto you, that I will pray vnto
the Father for you: 27 For the Father
himselfe loueth you, because ye haue
loued me, and haue beleeued that I came
out from God. 28 I am come out from
the Father, and came into the worlde:
againe I leaue the worlde, and goe to
the Father. 29 His disciples saide vnto
him, Loe, nowe speakest thou plainely,
and thou speakest no parable. 30 Nowe
knowe wee that thou knowest all things,
and needest not that any man should aske
thee. By this we beleeue, that thou art
come out from God. 31 Iesus answered
them, Doe you beleeue nowe? 32 Beholde,
the houre commeth, and is already come,
that ye shalbe scattered euery man into
his owne, and shall leaue me alone: but
I am not alone: for the Father is with
me. 33 These thinges haue I spoken vnto
you, that in me ye might haue peace: in
the world ye shall haue affliction, but be
of good comfort: I haue ouercome the
world.
17
1 These things spake Iesus, and lift vp
his eyes to heauen, and saide, Father, that
houre is come: glorifie thy Sonne, thatJohn 17:2
941
thy Sonne also may glorifie thee, 2 As thou
hast giuen him power ouer all flesh, that
he shoulde giue eternall life to all them
that thou hast giuen him. 3 And this is
life eternall, that they knowe thee to be
the onely very God, and whom thou hast
sent, Iesus Christ. 4 I haue glorified thee
on the earth: I haue finished the worke
which thou gauest me to doe. 5 And
nowe glorifie me, thou Father, with thine
owne selfe, with the glorie which I had
with thee before the world was. 6 I haue
declared thy Name vnto the men which
thou gauest me out of the world: thine
they were, and thou gauest them me, and
they haue kept thy worde. 7 Nowe they
knowe that all things whatsoeuer thou
hast giuen me, are of thee. 8 For I haue
giuen vnto them the wordes which thou
gauest me, and they haue receiued them,
and haue knowen surely that I came out
from thee, and haue beleeued that thou
hast sent me. 9 I pray for them: I pray
not for the worlde, but for them which
thou hast giuen me: for they are thine.
10 And al mine are thine, and thine are
mine, and I am glorified in them. 11 And
nowe am I no more in the world, but
these are in the worlde, and I come to
thee. Holy Father, keepe them in thy
Name, euen them whome thou hast giuen
mee, that they may bee one, as we are.
12 While I was with them in the worlde,
I kept them in thy Name: those that thou
gauest me, haue I kept, and none of them
is lost, but the childe of perdition, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled. 13 And now
come I to thee, and these things speake
I in the worlde, that they might haue my
ioy fulfilled in themselues. 14 I haue giuen
them thy word, and the world hath hated
them, because they are not of the world,
as I am not of the world. 15 I pray not
that thou shouldest take them out of the
world, but that thou keepe them from
euill. 16 They are not of the worlde, as
I am not of the world. 17 Sanctifie them
with thy trueth: thy word is trueth. 18 As
thou diddest send me into the world, so
haue I sent them into the world. 19 And
for their sakes sanctifie I my selfe, that
John 18:8
they also may bee sanctified through the
trueth. 20 I praie not for these alone, but
for them also which shall beleeue in mee,
through their woorde, 21 That they all may
bee one, as thou, O Father, art in me, and
I in thee: euen that they may be also one
in vs, that the worlde may beleeue that
thou hast sent me. 22 And the glory that
thou gauest me, I haue giuen them, that
they may be one, as we are one, 23 I in
them, and thou in mee, that they may be
made perfect in one, and that the worlde
may knowe that thou hast sent mee, and
hast loued them, as thou hast loued me.
24 Father, I will that they which thou hast
giuen me, be with me euen where I am,
that they may beholde that my glorie,
which thou hast giuen mee: for thou
louedst me before the foundation of the
world. 25 O righteous Father, the worlde
also hath not knowen thee, but I haue
knowen thee, and these haue knowen,
that thou hast sent me. 26 And I haue
declared vnto the thy Name, and will
declare it, that the loue wherewith thou
hast loued me, may be in them, and I in
them.

1 When Iesus had spoken these things,
hee went foorth with his disciples ouer
the brooke Cedron, where was a gar-
den, into the which he entred, and his
disciples. 2 And Iudas which betraied
him, knewe also the place: for Iesus oft
times resorted thither with his disciples.
3 Iudas then, after hee had receiued a
band of men and officers of the high
Priests, and of the Pharises, came thither
with lanternes and torches, and weapons.
4 Then Iesus, knowing all things that
shoulde come vnto him, went foorth and
said vnto them, Whom seeke yee? 5 They
answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus
sayde vnto them, I am hee. Nowe Iudas
also which betraied him, stoode with
them. 6 Assoone then as hee had saide
vnto them, I am hee, they went away
backewardes, and fell to the grounde.
7 Then he asked them againe, Whome
seeke yee?
And they sayd, Iesus of
Nazareth. 8 Iesus answered, I said vntoJohn 18:9
942
you, that I am he: therefore if ye seeke
me, let these go their way. 9 This was
that the worde might be fulfilled which
hee spake, Of them which thou gauest
me, haue I lost none. 10 Then Simon
Peter hauing a sword, drewe it, and smote
the hie Priests seruant, and cut off his
right eare. Nowe the seruants name was
Malchus. 11 Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter,
Put vp thy sworde into the sheath: shall I
not drinke of the cuppe which my Father
hath giuen me? 12 Then the bande and
the captaine, and the officers of the Iewes
tooke Iesus, and bound him, 13 And led
him away to Annas first (for he was father
in lawe to Caiaphas, which was the hie
Priest that same yeere) 14 And Caiaphas
was he, that gaue counsel to the Iewes,
that it was expedient that one man should
die for the people. 15 Nowe Simon Peter
folowed Iesus, and another disciple, and
that disciple was knowen of the hie Priest:
therefore he went in with Iesus into the
hall of the hie Priest: 16 But Peter stood
at the doore without. Then went out the
other disciple which was knowen vnto
the hie Priest, and spake to her that kept
the doore, and brought in Peter. 17 Then
saide the maide that kept the doore, vnto
Peter, Art not thou also one of this mans
disciples? He sayd, I am not. 18 And
the seruants and officers stoode there,
which had made a fire of coles: for it
was colde, and they warmed themselues.
And Peter also stood among them, and
warmed himselfe. 19 (The hie Priest then
asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his
doctrine. 20 Iesus answered him, I spake
openly to the world: I euer taught in the
Synagogue and in the Temple, whither
the Iewes resort continually, and in secret
haue I sayde nothing. 21 Why askest
thou mee? aske them which heard mee
what I sayde vnto them: beholde, they
knowe what I sayd. 22 When he had
spoken these thinges, one of the officers
which stoode by, smote Iesus with his
rod, saying, Answerest thou the hie Priest
so? 23 Iesus answered him, If I haue
euill spoken, beare witnes of the euil: but
if I haue well spoken, why smitest thou
John 18:39
me? 24 Nowe Annas had sent him bound
vnto Caiaphas the hie Priest) 25 And Simon
Peter stoode and warmed himselfe, and
they said vnto him, Art not thou also of
his disciples? He denied it, and said, I
am not. 26 One of the seruaunts of the
hie Priest, his cousin whose eare Peter
smote off, saide, Did not I see thee in the
garden with him? 27 Peter then denied
againe, and immediatly the cocke crewe.
28 Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas
into the common hall.
Nowe it was
morning, and they themselues went not
into the common hall, least they should
be defiled, but that they might eate the
Passeouer. 29 Pilate then went out vnto
them, and said, What accusation bring
yee against this man? 30 They answered,
and saide vnto him, If hee were not an
euill doer, we woulde not haue deliuered
him vnto thee. 31 Then sayde Pilate vnto
them, Take yee him, and iudge him after
your owne Lawe. Then the Iewes sayde
vnto him, It is not lawfull for vs to put
any man to death. 32 It was that the
worde of Iesus might be fulfilled which
he spake, signifying what death he should
die. 33 So Pilate entred into the common
hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde
vnto him, Art thou the king of the Iewes?
34 Iesus answered him, Saiest thou that of
thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me?
35 Pilate answered, Am I a Iewe? Thine
owne nation, and the hie Priestes haue
deliuered thee vnto me. What hast thou
done? 36 Iesus answered, My kingdome is
not of this worlde: if my kingdome were
of this worlde, my seruants would surely
fight, that I should not be deliuered to the
Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from
hence. 37 Pilate then said vnto him, Art
thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou
sayest that I am a King: for this cause
am I borne, and for this cause came I
into the world, that I should beare witnes
vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the
trueth, heareth my voyce. 38 Pilate said
vnto him, What is trueth? And when he
had saide that, hee went out againe vnto
the Iewes, and said vnto them, I finde in
him no cause at all. 39 But you haue a
custome, that I shoulde deliuer you oneJohn 18:40
943
loose at the Passeouer: will yee then that
I loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?
40 Then cried they all againe, saying, Not
him, but Barabbas: nowe this Barabbas
was a murtherer.
19
1 Then Pilate tooke Iesus and scourged
him. 2 And the souldiers platted a crowne
of thornes, and put it on his head, and
they put on him a purple garment, 3 And
saide, Haile, King of the Iewes. And they
smote him with their roddes. 4 Then
Pilate went foorth againe, and said vnto
them, Behold, I bring him forth to you,
that ye may knowe, that I finde no fault
in him at all. 5 Then came Iesus foorth
wearing a crowne of thornes, and a pur-
ple garment. And Pilate said vnto them,
Beholde the man. 6 Then when the hie
Priests and officers sawe him, they cried,
saying, Crucifie, crucifie him. Pilate said
vnto them, Take yee him and crucifie him:
for I finde no fault in him. 7 The Iewes
answered him, We haue a lawe, and
by our law he ought to die, because he
made himselfe the Sonne of God. 8 When
Pilate then heard that woorde, he was
the more afraide, 9 And went againe into
the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus,
Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him
none answere. 10 Then saide Pilate vnto
him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest
thou not that I haue power to crucifie
thee, and haue power to loose thee?
11 Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no
power at all against me, except it were
giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that
deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater
sinne. 12 From thence foorth Pilate sought
to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying,
If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars
friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe
a King, speaketh against Cesar. 13 When
Pilate heard this woorde, hee brought
Iesus foorth, and sate downe in the iudge-
ment seate in a place called the Pauement,
and in Hebrewe, Gabbatha. 14 And it
was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and
about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto
the Iewes, Beholde your King. 15 But they
cried, Away with him, away with him,
John 19:30
crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall
I crucifie your King? The high Priestes
answered, We haue no King but Cesar.
16 Then deliuered he him vnto them, to
be crucified. And they tooke Iesus, and
led him away. 17 And he bare his owne
crosse, and came into a place named
of dead mens Skulles, which is called
in Hebrewe, Golgotha: 18 Where they
crucified him, and two other with him, on
either side one, and Iesus in the middes.
19 And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it
on the crosse, and it was written, JESUS
OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWES.
20 This title then read many of the Iewes:
for the place where Iesus was crucified,
was neere to the citie: and it was written
in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine. 21 Then
saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate,
Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that
he sayd, I am King of the Iewes. 22 Pilate
answered, What I haue written, I haue
written. 23 Then the souldiers, when they
had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments
(and made foure partes, to euery souldier
a part) and his coat: and the coat was
without seame wouen from the toppe
throughout. 24 Therefore they sayde one
to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast
lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, which
sayth, They parted my garments among
them, and on my coate did cast lots. So
the souldiers did these things in deede.
25 Then stoode by the crosse of Iesus his
mother, and his mothers sister, Marie the
wife of Cleopas, and Marie Magdalene.
26 And when Iesus sawe his mother, and
the disciple standing by, whom he loued,
he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde
thy sonne. 27 Then saide he to the disciple,
Beholde thy mother: and from that houre,
the disciple tooke her home vnto him.
28 After, when Iesus knew that all things
were performed, that the Scripture might
be fulfilled, he said, I thirst. 29 And there
was set a vessell full of vineger: and they
filled a spondge with vineger: and put
it about an Hyssope stalke, and put it
to his mouth. 30 Nowe when Iesus had
receiued of the vineger, he saide, It isJohn 19:31
944
finished, and bowed his head, and gaue
vp the ghost. 31 The Iewes then (because
it was the Preparation, that the bodies
should not remaine vpon the crosse on
the Sabbath day: for that Sabbath was an
hie day) besought Pilate that their legges
might be broken, and that they might be
taken downe. 32 Then came the souldiers
and brake the legges of the first, and of
the other, which was crucified with Iesus.
33 But when they came to Iesus, and saw
that he was dead alreadie, they brake not
his legges. 34 But one of the souldiers with
a speare pearced his side, and foorthwith
came there out blood and water. 35 And
he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his
record is true: and he knoweth that
he saith true, that ye might beleeue it.
36 For these things were done, that the
Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone
of him shalbe broken. 37 And againe an
other Scripture saith, They shall see him
whom they haue thrust through. 38 And
after these things, Ioseph of Arimathea
(who was a disciple of Iesus, but secretly
for feare of the Iewes) besought Pilate
that he might take downe the bodie of
Iesus. And Pilate gaue him licence. He
came then and tooke Iesus body. 39 And
there came also Nicodemus (which first
came to Iesus by night) and brought of
myrrhe and aloes mingled together about
an hundreth pound. 40 Then tooke they
the body of Iesus, and wrapped it in
linnen clothes with the odours, as the
maner of the Iewes is to burie. 41 And
in that place where Iesus was crucified,
was a garden, and in the garden a newe
sepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet
42 There then laide they Iesus,
laid.
because of the Iewes Preparation day, for
the sepulchre was neere.
20
1 Nowe the first day of the weeke came
Marie Magdalene, early when it was yet
darke, vnto the sepulchre, and sawe the
stone taken away from the tombe. 2 Then
she ranne, and came to Simon Peter, and
to the other disciple whom Iesus loued,
and saide vnto them, They haue taken
John 20:19
away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and
we knowe not where they haue laid him.
3 Peter therefore went forth, and the
other disciple, and they came vnto the
sepulchre. 4 So they ranne both together,
but the other disciple did outrunne Peter,
and came first to the sepulchre. 5 And
he stouped downe, and sawe the linnen
clothes lying: yet went he not in. 6 Then
came Simon Peter following him, and
went into the sepulchre, and sawe the
linnen clothes lye, 7 And the kerchiefe
that was vpon his head, not lying with
the linnen clothes, but wrapped together
in a place by it selfe. 8 Then went in
also the other disciple, which came first
to the sepulchre, and he sawe it, and
beleeued. 9 For as yet they knewe not
the Scripture, That he must rise againe
from the dead. 10 And the disciples went
away againe vnto their owne home. 11 But
Marie stoode without at the sepulchre
weeping: and as she wept, she bowed her
selfe into the sepulchre, 12 And sawe two
Angels in white, sitting, the one at the
head, and the other at the feete, where the
body of Iesus had laien. 13 And they said
vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She
said vnto them, They haue taken away my
Lord, and I know not where they haue
laide him. 14 When she had thus said, she
turned her selfe backe, and sawe Iesus
standing, and knewe not that it was Iesus.
15 Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why
weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She
supposing that he had bene the gardener,
said vnto him, Sir, if thou hast borne
him hence, tell me where thou hast laid
him, and I will take him away. 16 Iesus
saith vnto her, Marie. She turned her
selfe, and said vnto him, Rabboni, which
is to say, Master. 17 Iesus saith vnto her,
Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended
to my Father: but goe to my brethren,
and say vnto them, I ascend vnto my
Father, and to your Father, and to my God,
and your God. 18 Marie Magdalene came
and told the disciples that she had seene
the Lord, and that he had spoken these
things vnto her. 19 The same day then
at night, which was the first day of theJohn 20:20
945
weeke, and when the doores were shut
where the disciples were assembled for
feare of the Iewes, came Iesus and stoode
in the middes, and saide to them, Peace
be vnto you. 20 And when he had so
saide, he shewed vnto them his handes,
and his side. Then were the disciples glad
when they had seene the Lord. 21 Then
saide Iesus to them againe, Peace be vnto
you: as my Father sent me, so sende I
you. 22 And when he had saide that, he
breathed on them, and saide vnto them,
Receiue the holy Ghost. 23 Whosoeuers
sinnes ye remit, they are remitted vnto
them: and whosoeuers sinnes ye reteine,
they are reteined. 24 But Thomas one
of the twelue, called Didymus, was not
with them when Iesus came. 25 The other
disciples therefore saide vnto him, We
haue seene the Lord: but he said vnto
them, Except I see in his handes the
print of the nailes, and put my finger
into the print of the nailes, and put mine
hand into his side, I will not beleeue
it. 26 And eight dayes after, againe his
disciples were within, and Thomas with
them. Then came Iesus, when the doores
were shut, and stood in the middes, and
said, Peace be vnto you. 27 After saide he
to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see
mine hands, and put forth thine hand,
and put it into my side, and be not
faithlesse, but faithfull. 28 Then Thomas
answered, and said vnto him, Thou art my
Lord, and my God. 29 Iesus said vnto him,
Thomas, because thou hast seene me,
thou beleeuest: blessed are they that haue
not seene, and haue beleeued. 30 And
many other signes also did Iesus in the
presence of his disciples, which are not
written in this booke. 31 But these things
are written, that ye might beleeue, that
Iesus is that Christ that Sonne of God,
and that in beleeuing ye might haue life
through his Name.
21
1 After these things, Iesus shewed him-
selfe againe to his disciples at the sea of
Tiberias: and thus shewed he himselfe:
2 There were together Simon Peter, and
Thomas, which is called Didymus, and
John 21:17
Nathanael of Cana in Galile, and the
sonnes of Zebedeus, and two other of his
disciples. 3 Simon Peter said vnto them,
I go a fishing. They said vnto him, We
also will goe with thee. They went their
way and entred into a ship straightway,
and that night caught they nothing. 4 But
when the morning was nowe come, Iesus
stoode on the shore: neuerthelesse the
disciples knewe not that it was Iesus.
5 Iesus then said vnto them, Syrs, haue
ye any meate? They answered him, No.
6 Then he said vnto them, Cast out the
net on the right side of the ship, and ye
shall finde. So they cast out, and they
were not able at all to draw it, for the
multitude of fishes. 7 Therefore said the
disciple whom Iesus loued, vnto Peter, It
is the Lord. When Simon Peter heard that
it was the Lord, he girded his coate to him
(for he was naked) and cast himselfe into
the sea. 8 But the other disciples came by
shippe (for they were not farre from land,
but about two hundreth cubites) and they
drewe the net with fishes. 9 Assoone then
as they were come to land, they sawe
hoate coales, and fish laide thereon, and
bread. 10 Iesus saide vnto them, Bring of
the fishes, which ye haue nowe caught.
11 Simon Peter stepped foorth and drewe
the net to land, full of great fishes, an
hundreth, fiftie and three: and albeit
there were so many, yet was not the net
broken. 12 Iesus saide vnto them, Come,
and dine. And none of the disciples durst
aske him, Who art thou? seeing they
knewe that he was the Lord. 13 Iesus then
came and tooke bread, and gaue them,
and fish likewise. 14 This is now the third
time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his
disciples, after that he was risen againe
from the dead. 15 So when they had
dined, Iesus said to Simon Peter, Simon
the sonne of Iona, louest thou me more
then these? He said vnto him, Yea Lord,
thou knowest that I loue thee. He said
vnto him, Feede my lambes. 16 He said
to him againe the second time, Simon the
sonne of Iona, louest thou me? He said
vnto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I
loue thee. He said vnto him, Feede my
sheepe. 17 He said vnto him the third time,John 21:18
946
Simon the sonne of Iona, louest thou me?
Peter was sorie because he said to him the
third time, Louest thou me? and said vnto
him, Lord, thou knowest all things: thou
knowest that I loue thee. Iesus saide vnto
him, Feede my sheepe. 18 Verely, verely
I say vnto thee, When thou wast yong,
thou girdedst thy selfe, and walkedst
whither thou wouldest: but when thou
shalt be olde, thou shalt stretch foorth
thine hands, and another shall gird thee,
and lead thee whither thou wouldest not.
19 And this spake he signifying by what
death he shoulde glorifie God. And when
he had said this, he said to him, Folowe
me. 20 Then Peter turned about, and sawe
the disciple whom JESUS loued, folowing,
which had also leaned on his breast at
supper, and had saide, Lord, which is
he that betrayeth thee? 21 When Peter
therefore sawe him, he saide to Iesus,
Lord, what shall this man doe? 22 Iesus
said vnto him, If I will that he tarie till I
come, what is it to thee? follow thou me.
23 Then went this worde abroade among
the brethren, that this disciple shoulde
not die. Yet Iesus saide not to him, He
shall not die: but if I will that he tarie till
I come, what is it to thee? 24 This is that
disciple, which testifieth of these things,
and wrote these things, and we know
that his testimonie is true. 25 Nowe there
are also many other things which Iesus
did, the which if they should be written
euery one, I suppose the world coulde
not conteine the bookes that shoulde be
written, Amen.

947
THE ACTS OF THE
APOSTLES
1 I
have made the former treatise, O
Theophilus, of al that Jesus began to doe
and teach, 2 Vntill the day that hee was
taken vp, after that hee through the holy
Ghost, had giuen commandements vnto
the Apostles, whome hee had chosen:
3 To whome also he presented himselfe
aliue after that he had suffered, by many
infallible tokens, being seene of them by
the space of fourtie daies, and speaking
of those thinges which appertaine to the
kingdome of God. 4 And when he had
gathered them together, he commanded
them, that they should not depart from
Hierusalem, but to waite for the promise
of the Father, which sayde hee, yee haue
heard of me. 5 For Iohn in deede baptized
with water, but ye shall be baptized
with the holy Ghost within these fewe
daies. 6 When they therefore were come
together, they asked of him, saying, Lord,
wilt thou at this time restore the king-
dome to Israel? 7 And hee saide vnto
them, It is not for you to know the times,
or the seasons, which the Father hath
put in his owne power, 8 But yee shall
receiue power of the holy Ghost, when
he shall come on you: and ye shalbe
witnesses vnto me both in Hierusalem
and in all Iudea, and in Samaria, and vnto
the vttermost part of the earth. 9 And
when he had spoken these things, while
they behelde, he was taken vp: for a
cloude tooke him vp out of their sight.
10 And while they looked stedfastly to-
warde heauen, as hee went, beholde, two
men stoode by them in white apparell,
11 Which also sayde, Yee men of Galile,
why stande yee gasing into heauen? This
Iesus which is taken vp from you into
heauen, shall so come, as yee haue seene
him goe into heauen. 12 Then returned
they vnto Hierusalem from the mount
that is called the mount of Oliues, which
is neere to Hierusalem, being from it
a Sabbath daies iourney. 13 And when
Acts 1:26
they were come in, they went vp into an
vpper chamber, where abode both Peter
and Iames, and Iohn, and Andrew, Philip,
and Thomas, Bartlemew, and Matthewe,
Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon
Zelotes, and Iudas Iames brother. 14 These
all continued with one accorde in prayer
and supplication with the women, and
Marie the mother of Iesus, and with his
brethren. 15 And in those dayes Peter
stoode vp in the middes of the disciples,
and sayde (nowe the nomber of names
that were in one place were about an
hundreth and twentie.) 16 Yee men and
brethren, this scripture must needes haue
beene fulfilled, which the holy Ghost by
the mouth of Dauid spake before of Iudas,
which was guide to them that tooke Iesus.
17 For hee was nombred with vs, and had
obteined fellowship in this ministration.
18 He therefore hath purchased a field
with the reward of iniquitie: and when he
had throwen downe himselfe headlong,
hee brast asunder in the middes, and
all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it
is knowen vnto all the inhabitants of
Hierusalem, in so much, that that field is
called in their owne language, Aceldama,
That is, the field of blood. 20 For it
is written in the booke of Psalmes, Let
his habitation be void, and let no man
dwel therein: also, Let another take his
charge. 21 Wherefore of these men which
haue companied with vs, all the time that
the Lord Iesus was conuersant among vs,
22 Beginning from the baptisme of Iohn
vnto the day that hee was taken vp from
vs, must one of them bee made a witnesse
with vs of his resurrection. 23 And they
presented two, Ioseph called Barsabas,
whose surname was Iustus, and Matthias.
24 And they praied, saying, Thou Lord,
which knowest the hearts of all men,
shewe whether of these two thou hast
chosen, 25 That he may take the roume
of this ministration and Apostleship, from
which Iudas hath gone astray, to goe
to his owne place. 26 Then they gaue
foorth their lottes: and the lotte fell on
Matthias, and hee was by a common
consent counted with the eleuen Apostles.Acts 2:1
948

1 And when the day of Pentecost was
come, they were al with one accord in
one place. 2 And suddenly there came a
sounde from heauen, as of a russhing and
mightie winde, and it filled all the house
where they sate. 3 And there appeared
vnto them clouen tongues, like fire, and
it sate vpon eche of them. 4 And they
were all filled with the holy Ghost, and
began to speake with other tongues, as
the Spirit gaue them vtterance. 5 And
there were dwelling at Hierusalem Iewes,
men that feared God, of euery nation
vnder heauen. 6 Nowe when this was
noised, the multitude came together and
were astonied, because that euery man
heard them speake his owne language.
7 And they wondered al, and marueiled,
saying among themselues, Beholde, are
not all these which speake, of Galile?
8 How then heare we euery man our
owne language, wherein we were borne?
9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and
the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and of
Iudea, and of Cappadocia, of Pontus, and
Asia, 10 And of Phrygia, and Pamphylia, of
Egypt, and of the partes of Libya, which
is beside Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
and Iewes, and Proselytes, 11 Creetes, and
Arabians: wee hearde them speake in
our owne tongues the wonderful works
of God. 12 They were all then amased, and
douted, saying one to another, What may
this be? 13 And others mocked, and saide,
They are full of newe wine. 14 But Peter
standing with ye Eleuen, lift vp his voice,
and said vnto them, Ye men of Iudea, and
ye all that inhabite Hierusalem, be this
knowen vnto you, and hearken vnto my
woordes. 15 For these are not drunken,
as yee suppose, since it is but the third
houre of the day. 16 But this is that, which
was spoken by the Prophet Ioel, 17 And it
shalbe in the last daies, saith God, I wil
powre out of my Spirite vpon al flesh, and
your sonnes, and your daughters shall
prophecie, and your yong men shall see
visions, and your old men shall dreame
dreames. 18 And on my seruauntes, and
on mine handmaides I will powre out of
Acts 2:33
my Spirite in those daies, and they shall
prophecie. 19 And I wil shew wonders in
heauen aboue, and tokens in the earth
beneath, blood, and fire, and the vapour
of smoke. 20 The Sunne shalbe turned into
darkenesse, and the moone into blood,
before that great and notable day of
the Lord come. 21 And it shalbe, that
whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the
Lord, shalbe saued. 22 Yee men of Israel,
heare these woordes, JESUS of Nazareth,
a man approued of God among you with
great workes, and wonders, and signes,
which God did by him in the middes
of you, as yee your selues also knowe:
23 Him, I say, being deliuered by the
determinate counsell, and foreknowledge
of God, after you had taken, with wicked
handes you haue crucified and slaine.
24 Whome God hath raised vp, and loosed
the sorrowes of death, because it was
vnpossible that he should be holden of
it. 25 For Dauid sayeth concerning him, I
beheld the Lord alwaies before me: for
hee is at my right hand, that I should
not be shaken. 26 Therefore did mine
heart reioyce, and my tongue was glad,
and moreouer also my flesh shall rest in
hope, 27 Because thou wilt not leaue my
soule in graue, neither wilt suffer thine
Holy one to see corruption. 28 Thou hast
shewed me the waies of life, and shalt
make me full of ioy with thy countenance.
29 Men and brethren, I may boldly speake
vnto you of the Patriarke Dauid, that
hee is both dead and buried, and his
sepulchre remaineth with vs vnto this
30 Therefore, seeing hee was a
day.
Prophet, and knewe that God had sworne
with an othe to him, that of the fruite
of his loynes hee woulde raise vp Christ
concerning the flesh, to set him vpon his
throne, 31 Hee knowing this before, spake
of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule
shoulde not bee left in graue, neither his
flesh shoulde see corruption. 32 This Iesus
hath God raised vp, whereof we all are
witnesses. 33 Since then that he by the
right hande of God hath bene exalted, and
hath receiued of his Father the promise
of the holy Ghost, hee hath shed foorthActs 2:34
949
this which yee nowe see and heare. 34 For
Dauid is not ascended into heauen, but
he sayth, The Lord sayd to my Lord, Sit
at my right hande, 35 Vntill I make thine
enemies thy footestoole. 36 Therefore, let
all the house of Israel know for a suretie,
that God hath made him both Lord, and
Christ, this Iesus, I say, whome yee haue
crucified. 37 Now when they heard it, they
were pricked in their heartes, and said
vnto Peter and the other Apostles, Men
and brethren, what shall we doe? 38 Then
Peter said vnto them, Amend your liues,
and bee baptized euery one of you in the
Name of Iesus Christ for the remission of
sinnes: and ye shall receiue the gift of the
holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is made
vnto you, and to your children, and to all
that are a farre off, euen as many as the
Lord our God shall call. 40 And with many
other words he besought and exhorted
them, saying, Saue your selues from this
froward generation. 41 Then they that
gladly receiued his word, were baptized:
and the same day there were added to
the Church about three thousand soules.
42 And they continued in the Apostles
doctrine, and fellowship, and breaking of
bread, and prayers. 43 And feare came
vpon euery soule: and many wonders
and signes were done by ye Apostles.
44 And all that beleeued, were in one
place, and had all things common. 45 And
they sold their possessions and goods, and
parted them to all me, as euery one had
need. 46 And they continued dayly with
one accord in the Temple, and breaking
bread at home, did eate their meate
together with gladnesse and singlenesse
of heart, 47 Praysing God, and had fauour
with all the people: and the Lord added
to the Church from day to day, such as
should be saued.

1 Nowe Peter and Iohn went vp together
into the Temple, at the ninth houre of
prayer. 2 And a certaine man which was
a creeple from his mothers wombe, was
caried, whom they layde dayly at the
gate of the Temple called Beautifull, to
Acts 3:18
aske almes of them that entred into ye
Temple. 3 Who seeing Peter and Iohn,
that they would enter into the Temple,
desired to receiue an almes. 4 And Peter
earnestly beholding him with Iohn, said,
Looke on vs. 5 And hee gaue heede vnto
them, trusting to receiue some thing of
them. 6 Then said Peter, Siluer and gold
haue I none, but such as I haue, that
giue I thee: In the Name of Iesus Christ
of Nazareth, rise vp and walke. 7 And
hee tooke him by the right hand, and lift
him vp, and immediately his feete and
ankle bones receiued strength. 8 And he
leaped vp, stoode, and walked, and entred
with them into the Temple, walking and
leaping, and praysing God. 9 And all
the people sawe him walke, and praysing
God. 10 And they knewe him, that it
was he which sate for the almes at the
Beautifull gate of the Temple: and they
were amased, and sore astonied at that,
which was come vnto him. 11 And as
the creeple which was healed, held Peter
and Iohn, all the people ranne amased
vnto them in the porch which is called
Salomons. 12 So when Peter saw it, he
answered vnto the people, Ye me of Israel,
why marueile ye at this? or why looke
ye so stedfastly on vs, as though by our
owne power or godlines, we had made
this man go? 13 The God of Abraham, and
Isaac, and Iacob, the God of our fathers
hath glorified his Sonne Iesus, whom ye
betrayed, and denied in the presence of
Pilate, when he had iudged him to be
deliuered. 14 But ye denied the Holy one
and the Iust, and desired a murtherer to
be giuen you, 15 And killed the Lord of life,
whome God hath raised from the dead,
whereof we are witnesses. 16 And his
Name hath made this man sound, whom
ye see, and know, through faith in his
Name: and the faith which is by him,
hath giuen to him this perfite health of
his whole body in the presence of you all.
17 And now brethren, I know that through
ignorance ye did it, as did also your
gouernours. 18 But those thinges which
God before had shewed by the mouth
of all his Prophets, that Christ shouldActs 3:19
950
suffer, he hath thus fulfilled. 19 Amend
your liues therefore, and turne, that your
sinnes may be put away, whe the time of
refreshing shall come from the presence
of the Lord. 20 And he shall sende Iesus
Christ, which before was preached vnto
you, 21 Whome the heauen must containe
vntill the time that all thinges be restored,
which God had spoken by the mouth of all
his holy Prophets since the world began.
22 For Moses said vnto the Fathers, The
Lord your God shall raise vp vnto you
a Prophet, euen of your brethren, like
vnto me: ye shall heare him in all things,
whatsoeuer he shall say vnto you. 23 For
it shalbe that euery person which shall
not heare that Prophet, shall be destroyed
out of the people. 24 Also all the Prophets
from Samuel, and thencefoorth as many
as haue spoken, haue likewise foretolde
of these dayes. 25 Ye are the children of
the Prophets, and of the couenant, which
God hath made vnto our fathers, saying to
Abraham, Euen in thy seede shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed. 26 First
vnto you hath God raysed vp his Sonne
Iesus, and him hee hath sent to blesse you,
in turning euery one of you from your
iniquities.
1 And
4
as they spake vnto the people,
the Priestes and the Captaine of the Tem-
ple, and the Sadduces came vpon them,
2 Taking it grieuously that they taught the
people, and preached in Iesus Name the
resurrection from the dead. 3 And they
layde handes on them, and put them in
holde, vntill the next day: for it was now
euentide. 4 Howbeit, many of them which
heard the word, beleeued, and the num-
ber of the men was about fiue thousand.
5 And it came to passe on the morow, that
their rulers, and Elders, and Scribes, were
gathered together at Hierusalem, 6 And
Annas the chiefe Priest, and Caiaphas,
and Iohn, and Alexander, and as many
as were of the kindred of the hie Priestes.
7 And whe they had set them before them,
they asked, By what power, or in what
Name haue ye done this? 8 Then Peter
Acts 4:23
ful of the holy Ghost, said vnto them,
Ye rulers of the people, and Elders of
Israel, 9 For as much as we this day are
examined of the good deede done to the
impotent man, to wit, by what meanes he
is made whole, 10 Be it knowen vnto you
all, and to all the people of Israel, that
by the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
whom ye haue crucified, whome God
raised againe from the dead, euen by
him doth this man stand here before you,
whole. 11 This is the stone cast aside of
you builders which is become the head of
the corner. 12 Neither is there saluation
in any other: for among men there is
giuen none other Name vnder heauen,
whereby we must be saued. 13 Now
when they sawe the boldnes of Peter and
Iohn, and vnderstoode that they were
vnlearned men and without knowledge,
they marueiled, and knew them, that they
had bin with Iesus: 14 And beholding also
the man which was healed standing with
them, they had nothing to say against
it. 15 Then they commanded them to goe
aside out of the Council, and conferred
among themselues, 16 Saying, What shall
we doe to these men?
for surely a
manifest signe is done by them, and it
is openly knowen to all them that dwell
in Hierusalem: and we cannot denie it.
17 But that it be noysed no farther among
the people, let vs threaten and charge
them, that they speake hencefoorth to no
man in this Name. 18 So they called them,
and commanded them, that in no wise
they should speake or teach in the Name
of Iesus. 19 But Peter and Iohn answered
vnto them, and said, Whether it be right
in the sight of God, to obey you rather
then God, iudge ye. 20 For we cannot but
speake the things which we haue seene
and heard. 21 So they threatened them,
and let them goe, and found nothing how
to punish them, because of the people: for
all men praised God for that which was
done. 22 For the man was aboue fourtie
yeeres olde, on whome this miracle of
healing was shewed. 23 Then assoone as
they were let goe, they came to their fel-
lowes, and shewed all that the hie PriestesActs 4:24
951
and Elders had said vnto them. 24 And
when they heard it, they lift vp their
voyces to God with one accord, and said,
O Lord, thou art the God which hast made
the heaue, and the earth, the sea, and all
things that are in them, 25 Which by the
mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide,
Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people
imagine vaine things? 26 The Kings of
the earth assembled, and the rulers came
together against the Lord, and against
his Christ. 27 For doutlesse, against thine
holy Sonne Iesus, whome thou haddest
anoynted, both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
with the Gentiles and the people of Israel
gathered themselues together, 28 To doe
whatsoeuer thine hand, and thy counsell
had determined before to be done. 29 And
nowe, O Lord, beholde their threatnings,
and graunt vnto thy seruants with all
boldnesse to speake thy word, 30 So that
thou stretch forth thine hand, that heal-
ing, and signes, and wonders may be done
by the Name of thine holy Sonne Iesus.
31 And when as they had prayed, the place
was shaken where they were assembled
together, and they were all filled with the
holy Ghost, and they spake the word of
God boldely. 32 And the multitude of them
that beleeued, were of one heart, and
of one soule: neither any of them said,
that any thing of that which he possessed,
was his owne, but they had all thinges
common. 33 And with great power gaue
the Apostles witnes of the resurrection
of the Lord Iesus: and great grace was
vpon them all. 34 Neither was there any
among them, that lacked: for as many
as were possessours of landes or houses,
solde them, and brought the price of the
things that were solde, 35 And layde it
downe at the Apostles feete, and it was
distributed vnto euery man, according as
he had neede. 36 Also Ioses which was
called of the Apostles, Barnabas (that is by
interpretation the sonne of consolation)
being a Leuite, and of the countrey of
Cyprus, 37 Where as he had land, solde it,
and brought the money, and laid it downe
at the Apostles feete.
Acts 5:15
5
1 But a certaine man named Ananias,
with Sapphira his wife, solde a posses-
sion, 2 And kept away part of the price, his
wife also being of counsell, and brought
a certaine part, and layde it downe at
the Apostles feete. 3 Then saide Peter,
Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine
heart, that thou shouldest lye vnto the
holy Ghost, and keepe away part of the
4 Whiles it
price of this possession?
remained, appertained it not vnto thee?
and after it was solde, was it not in thine
owne power? howe is it that thou hast
conceiued this thing in thine heart? thou
hast not lyed vnto men, but vnto God.
5 Now when Ananias heard these wordes,
he fell downe, and gaue vp the ghost.
Then great feare came on all them that
heard these things. 6 And the yong men
rose vp, and tooke him vp, and caried
him out, and buried him. 7 And it came
to passe about the space of three houres
after, that his wife came in, ignorant of
that which was done. 8 And Peter sayd
vnto her, Tell me, solde ye the land for
so much? And she sayd, Yea, for so
much. 9 Then Peter sayde vnto her, Why
haue ye agreed together, to tempt the
Spirit of the Lord? beholde, the feete of
them which haue buried thine husband,
are at the doore, and shall carie thee
out. 10 Then she fell downe straightway
at his feete, and yeelded vp the ghost:
and the yong men came in, and found
her dead, and caried her out, and buried
her by her husband. 11 And great feare
came on all the Church, and on as many
as heard these things. 12 Thus by the
hands of the Apostles were many signes
and wonders shewed among the people
(and they were all with one accorde in
Salomons porche. 13 And of the other
durst no man ioyne him selfe to them:
neuerthelesse the people magnified them.
14 Also the number of them that beleeued
in the Lord, both of men and women,
grewe more and more) 15 In so much that
they brought the sicke into the streetes,
and layd them on beds and couches, that
at the least way the shadowe of Peter,Acts 5:16
when he came by, might shadow some of
them. 16 There came also a multitude out
of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem,
bringing sicke folkes, and them which
were vexed with vncleane spirits, who
were all healed. 17 Then the chiefe Priest
rose vp, and all they that were with him
(which was the sect of the Sadduces) and
were full of indignation, 18 And laide
hands on the Apostles, and put them in
the common prison. 19 But the Angel
of the Lord, by night opened the prison
doores, and brought them forth, and sayd,
20 Go your way, and stand in the Temple,
and speake to the people, all the wordes
of this life. 21 So when they heard it,
they entred into the Temple early in the
morning, and taught. And the chiefe
Priest came, and they that were with him,
and called the Councill together, and all
the Elders of the children of Israel, and
sent to the prison, to cause them to be
brought. 22 But when the officers came,
and found them not in the prison, they
returned and tolde it, 23 Saying, Certainely
we founde the prison shut as sure as
was possible, and the keepers standing
without, before the doores: but when we
had opened, we found no man within.
24 Then when the chiefe Priest, and the
captaine of the Temple, and the hie
Priestes heard these things, they doubted
of them, whereunto this would growe.
25 Then came one and shewed them,
saying, Beholde, the men that ye put in
prison, are standing in the Temple, and
teach the people. 26 Then went the cap-
taine with the officers, and brought them
without violence (for they feared the peo-
ple, lest they should haue bene stoned)
27 And when they had brought them, they
set them before the Councill, and the
chiefe Priest asked them, 28 Saying, Did
not we straightly commaund you, that
ye should not teach in this Name? and
behold, ye haue filled Hierusale with your
doctrine, and ye would bring this mans
blood vpon vs. 29 Then Peter and the
Apostles answered, and sayd, We ought
rather to obey God then men. 30 The
God of our fathers hath raised vp Iesus,
952
Acts 6:2
whom ye slewe, and hanged on a tree.
31 Him hath God lift vp with his right
hand, to be a Prince and a Sauiour, to
giue repentance to Israel, and forgiuenes
of sinnes. 32 And we are his witnesses
concerning these things which we say:
yea, and the holy Ghost, whome God hath
giuen to them that obey him. 33 Now
when they heard it, they brast for anger,
and consulted to slay them. 34 Then
stoode there vp in the Councill a certaine
Pharise named Gamaliel, a doctour of the
Lawe, honoured of all the people, and
commanded to put the Apostles forth a
litle space, 35 And sayd vnto them, Men
of Israel, take heede to your selues, what
ye intende to doe touching these men.
36 For before these times, rose vp Theudas
boasting himselfe, to whom resorted a
number of men, about a foure hundreth,
who was slaine: and they all which
obeyed him, were scattered, and brought
to nought. 37 After this man, arose vp
Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the tribute,
and drewe away much people after him:
hee also perished, and all that obeyed
him, were scattered abroad. 38 And nowe
I say vnto you, Refraine your selues from
these men, and let them alone: for if
this counsell, or this worke be of men,
it will come to nought: 39 But if it be
of God, ye can not destroy it, lest ye be
found euen fighters against God. 40 And to
him they agreed, and called the Apostles:
and when they had beaten them, they
commanded that they should not speake
in the Name of Iesus, and let them goe.
41 So they departed from the Councill,
reioycing, that they were counted worthy
to suffer rebuke for his Name. 42 And
dayly in the Temple, and from house
to house they ceased not to teach, and
preach Iesus Christ.
1 And
6
in those dayes, as the nomber
of ye disciples grewe, there arose a
murmuring of the Grecians towards ye
Hebrewes, because their widowes were
neglected in the dayly ministring. 2 Then
the twelue called the multitude of theActs 6:3
953
disciples together, and sayd, It is not
meete that we should leaue the worde
of God to serue the tables. 3 Wherefore
brethren, looke ye out among you seuen
men of honest report, and full of the
holy Ghost, and of wisedome, which we
4 And
may appoint to this busines.
we will giue our selues continually to
prayer, and to the ministration of the
worde. 5 And the saying pleased the
whole multitude: and they chose Steuen
a man full of fayth and of the holy
Ghost, and Philippe, and Prochorus, and
Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and
Nicolas a Proselyte of Antiochia, 6 Which
they set before the Apostles: and they
prayed, and layed their hands on them.
7 And the worde of God increased, and the
nomber of the disciples was multipled in
Hierusalem greatly, and a great company
of the Priests were obedient to the faith.
8 Now Steuen full of faith and power, did
great wonders and miracles among the
people. 9 Then there arose certaine of the
Synagogue, which are called Libertines,
and Cyrenians, and of Alexandria, and of
them of Cilicia, and of Asia, and disputed
with Steuen. 10 But they were not able
to resist the wisdome, and the Spirit by
the which he spake. 11 Then they sub-
orned men, which saide, We haue heard
him speake blasphemous wordes against
Moses, and God. 12 Thus they mooued the
people and the Elders, and the Scribes:
and running vpon him, caught him, and
brought him to the Councill, 13 And set
forth false witnesses, which sayd, This
man ceasseth not to speake blasphemous
wordes against this holy place, and the
Law. 14 For we haue heard him say, that
this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
place, and shall change the ordinances,
which Moses gaue vs. 15 And as all that
sate in the Councill, looked stedfastly on
him, they saw his face as it had bene the
face of an Angel.
Acts 7:17
God of glory appeared vnto our father
Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia,
before he dwelt in Charran, 3 And said
vnto him, Come out of thy countrey, and
from thy kindred, and come into the
land, which I shall shewe thee. 4 Then
came he out of the land of the Chaldeans,
and dwelt in Charran. And after that
his father was dead, God brought him
from thence into this land, wherein ye
now dwell, 5 And hee gaue him none
inheritance in it, no, not the bredth of
a foote: yet he promised that he would
giue it to him for a possession, and to
his seede after him, when as yet hee
had no childe. 6 But God spake thus,
that his seede should be a soiourner in a
strange land: and that they should keepe
it in bondage, and entreate it euill foure
hundreth yeeres. 7 But the nation to
whome they shall be in bondage, will I
iudge, sayth God: and after that, they
shall come forth and serue me in this
place. 8 Hee gaue him also the couenant
of circumcision: and so Abraham begate
Isaac, and circumcised him the eight day:
and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob the
twelue Patriarkes. 9 And the Patriarkes
moued with enuie, solde Ioseph into
Egypt: but God was with him, 10 And
deliuered him out of all his afflictions,
and gaue him fauour and wisdome in
the sight of Pharao King of Egypt, who
made him gouernour ouer Egypt, and
ouer his whole house. 11 Then came there
a famine ouer all the land of Egypt and
Chanaan, and great affliction, that our
fathers found no sustenance. 12 But when
Iacob heard that there was corne in Egypt,
he sent our fathers first: 13 And at the
second time, Ioseph was knowen of his
brethren, and Iosephs kindred was made
knowen vnto Pharao. 14 Then sent Ioseph
and caused his father to be brought,
and all his kindred, euen threescore and
fifteene soules. 15 So Iacob went downe
into Egypt, and he dyed, and our fathers,
16 And were remoued into Sychem, and
were put in the sepulchre, that Abraham

brethren and Fathers, hearken. That the time of the promise drewe neere,Acts 7:18
954
which God had sworne to Abraham, the
people grewe and multiplied in Egypt,
18 Till another King arose, which knewe
not Ioseph. 19 The same dealt subtilly
with our kindred, and euill entreated
our fathers, and made them to cast out
their yong children, that they should not
remaine aliue. 20 The same time was
Moses borne, and was acceptable vnto
God, which was nourished vp in his
fathers house three moneths. 21 And
when he was cast out, Pharaohs daughter
tooke him vp, and nourished him for her
owne sonne. 22 And Moses was learned
in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, and
was mightie in wordes and in deedes.
23 Nowe when he was full fourtie yeere
olde, it came into his heart to visite his
brethren, the children of Israel. 24 And
whe he saw one of them suffer wrong, he
defended him, and auenged his quarell
that had the harme done to him, and
smote the Egyptian. 25 For hee supposed
his brethren would haue vnderstand, that
God by his hande should giue them deli-
uerance: but they vnderstoode it not.
26 And the next day, he shewed himselfe
vnto them as they stroue, and woulde
haue set them at one againe, saying, Syrs,
ye are brethren: why doe ye wrong one to
another? 27 But he that did his neighbour
wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who
made thee a prince, and a iudge ouer vs?
28 Wilt thou kill mee, as thou diddest the
Egyptian yesterday? 29 Then fled Moses at
that saying, and was a stranger in the land
of Madian, where he begate two sonnes.
30 And when fourtie yeres were expired,
there appeared to him in the wildernes
of mout Sina, an Angel of the Lord in a
flame of fire, in a bush. 31 And when
Moses sawe it, hee wondred at the sight:
and as he drew neere to consider it, the
voyce of the Lord came vnto him, saying,
32 I am the God of thy fathers, the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
the God of Iacob. Then Moses trembled,
and durst not behold it. 33 Then the Lord
said to him, Put off thy shoes from thy
feete: for the place where thou standest,
is holy ground. 34 I haue seene, I haue
seene the affliction of my people, which is
Acts 7:46
in Egypt, and I haue heard their groning,
and am come downe to deliuer them:
and nowe come, and I will sende thee
into Egypt. 35 This Moses whome they
forsooke, saying, Who made thee a prince
and a iudge? the same God sent for a
prince, and a deliuerer by the hand of the
Angel, which appeared to him in the bush.
36 Hee brought them out, doing wonders,
and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in
the red sea, and in the wildernes fourtie
yeeres. 37 This is that Moses, which saide
vnto the children of Israel, A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise vp vnto
you, euen of your brethren, like vnto me:
him shall ye heare. 38 This is he that
was in the Congregation, in the wildernes
with the Angell, which spake to him in
mount Sina, and with our fathers, who
receiued the liuely oracles to giue vnto vs.
39 To whom our fathers would not obey,
but refused, and in their hearts turned
backe againe into Egypt: 40 Saying vnto
Aaron, Make vs gods that may goe before
vs: for we knowe not what is become
of this Moses that brought vs out of the
land of Egypt. 41 And they made a calfe
in those dayes, and offered sacrifice vnto
the idole, and reioyced in the workes of
their owne handes. 42 Then God turned
himselfe away, and gaue them vp to serue
the host of heauen, as it is written in the
booke of the Prophets, O house of Israel,
haue ye offred to me slaine beasts and
sacrifices by the space of fourtie yeres
in the wildernes? 43 And ye tooke vp
the tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre
of your god Remphan, figures, which ye
made to worship them: therefore I will
carie you away beyond Babylon. 44 Our
fathers had the tabernacle of witnes, in
the wildernes, as hee had appointed,
speaking vnto Moses, that he should make
it according to the fashion that he had

Iacob. 47 But Salomon built him an house.
48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not
in temples made with handes, as saith
the Prophet, 49 Heauen is my throne, and
earth is my footestoole: what house wil
ye build for me, saith the Lord? or what
place is it that I should rest in? 50 Hath
not mine hand made all these things?
51 Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised
heartes and eares, ye haue alwayes re-
sisted the holy Ghost: as your fathers did,
so do you. 52 Which of the Prophets haue
not your fathers persecuted? and they
haue slaine them, which shewed before
of the comming of that Iust, of whome
ye are now the betrayers and murtherers,
53 Which haue receiued the Lawe by the
ordinance of Angels, and haue not kept
it. 54 But when they heard these thinges,
their heartes brast for anger, and they
gnashed at him with their teeth. 55 But
he being full of the holy Ghost, looked
stedfastly into heauen, and sawe the glory
of God, and Iesus standing at the right
hand of God, 56 And said, Beholde, I see
the heauens open, and the Sonne of man
standing at the right hand of God. 57 Then
they gaue a shoute with a loude voyce,
and stopped their eares, and ranne vpon
him violently all at once, 58 And cast him
out of the citie, and stoned him: and the
witnesses layd downe their clothes at a
yong mans feete, named Saul. 59 And they
stoned Steuen, who called on God, and
said, Lord Iesus, receiue my spirit. 60 And
he kneeled downe, and cried with a loude
voyce, Lord, laye not this sinne to their
charge. And when he had thus spoken,
he slept.
8
1 And Saul consented to his death, and
at that time, there was a great perse-
cution against the Church which was at
Hierusalem, and they were all scattered
abroad thorowe the regions of Iudea and
of Samaria, except the Apostles. 2 Then
certaine men fearing God, caried Steuen
amongs them, to be buried, and made
great lamentation for him. 3 But Saul
made hauocke of the Church, and entred
Acts 8:20
into euery house, and drewe out both
men and women, and put them into
prison. 4 Therefore they that were scat-
tered abroad, went to and from preaching
the worde. 5 Then came Philip into the
citie of Samaria, and preached Christ
vnto them. 6 And the people gaue heed
vnto those things which Philippe spake,
with one accorde, hearing and seeing the
miracles which he did. 7 For vncleane
spirits crying with a loud voyce, came out
of many that were possessed of them: and
many taken with palsies, and that halted,
were healed. 8 And there was great ioy
in that citie. 9 And there was before in
the citie a certaine man called Simon,
which vsed witchcraft, and bewitched
the people of Samaria, saying that he
himselfe was some great man. 10 To
whome they gaue heede from the least to
the greatest, saying, This man is that great
power of God. 11 And they gaue heed
vnto him, because that of long time he
had bewitched them with sorceries. 12 But
assoone as they beleeued Philip, which
preached the thinges that concerned the
kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus
Christ, they were baptized both men and
women. 13 Then Simon himselfe beleeued
also and was baptized, and continued
with Philippe, and wondred, when he
sawe the signes and great miracles which
were done. 14 Nowe when the Apostles,
which were at Hierusalem, heard say,
that Samaria had receiued the worde of
God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn.
15 Which whe they were come downe,
prayed for them, that they might receiue
the holy Ghost. 16 (For as yet, hee was
fallen downe on none of them, but they
were baptized onely in the Name of the

handes on them, and they receiued the
holy Ghost. 18 And when Simon sawe,
that through laying on of the Apostles
hands the holy Ghost was giuen, he offred
them money, 19 Saying, Giue mee also
this power, that on whomsoeuer I lay the
handes, he may receiue the holy Ghost.
20 Then saide Peter vnto him, Thy money
perish with thee, because thou thinkestActs 8:21
956
that the gift of God may be obteined with
money. 21 Thou hast neither part nor
fellowship in this businesse: for thine
heart is not right in the sight of God.
22 Repent therefore of this thy wickednes,
and pray God, that if it be possible, the
thought of thine heart may be forgiuen
thee. 23 For I see that thou art in the
gall of bitternes, and in the bonde of
iniquitie. 24 Then answered Simon, and
said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none
of these things which ye haue spoken,
come vpon me. 25 So they, when they
had testified and preached the worde of
the Lord, returned to Hierusalem, and
preached the Gospel in many townes of
the Samaritans. 26 Then the Angel of the
Lord spake vnto Philip, saying, Arise, and
goe towarde the South vnto the way that
goeth downe from Hierusalem vnto Gaza,
which is waste. 27 And hee arose and went
on: and beholde, a certaine Eunuche
of Ethiopia, Candaces the Queene of the
Ethiopians chiefe Gouernour, who had
the rule of all her treasure, and came
to Hierusalem to worship: 28 And as he
returned sitting in his charet, he read
Esaias the Prophet. 29 Then the Spirit said
vnto Philip, Goe neere and ioyne thy selfe
to yonder charet. 30 And Philip ranne
thither, and heard him reade the Prophet
Esaias, and said, But vnderstandest thou
what thou readest? 31 And he saide, Howe
can I, except I had a guide? And he
desired Philip, that he would come vp and
sit with him. 32 Nowe the place of the
Scripture which he read, was this, Hee
was lead as a sheepe to the slaughter: and
like a lambe domme before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth. 33 In his humil-
itie his iudgement hath bene exalted: but
who shall declare his generation? for his
life is taken from the earth. 34 Then the
Eunuche answered Philippe, and saide, I
pray thee of whome speaketh the Prophet
this?
of himselfe, or of some other
35
man?
Then Philip opened his mouth,
and began at the same Scripture, and
preached vnto him Iesus. 36 And as they
went on their way, they came vnto a
certaine water, and the Eunuche said, See,
Acts 9:11
here is water: what doeth let me to be
baptized? 37 And Philippe said vnto him,
If thou beleeuest with all thine heart, thou
mayest. Then he answered, and saide,
I beleeue that that Iesus Christ is that
Sonne of God. 38 Then he commanded
the charet to stand stil: and they went
downe both into the water, both Philip
and the Eunuche, and he baptized him.
39 And assoone as they were come vp out
of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught
away Philip, that the Eunuche sawe him
no more: so he went on his way reioycing.
40 But Philippe was found at Azotus, and
he walked to and from preaching in all
the cities, till he came to Cesarea.

1 And Saul yet breathing out threatnings
and slaughter against the disciples of ye
Lord, went vnto the hie Priest, 2 And
desired of him letters to Damascus to
the Synagogues, that if he found any
that were of that way (either men or
women) hee might bring them bound
3 Now as he iour-
vnto Hierusalem.
neyed, it came to passe that as he was
come neere to Damascus, suddenly there
shined rounde about him a light from
heauen. 4 And hee fell to the earth, and
heard a voyce, saying to him, Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? 5 And he sayd,
Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord sayd,
I am Iesus whom thou persecutest: it is
hard for thee to kicke against pricks. 6 He
then both trembling and astonied, sayd,
Lord, what wilt thou that I doe? And
the Lord sayd vnto him, Arise and goe
into the citie, and it shall be tolde thee
what thou shalt doe. 7 The men also
which iourneyed with him, stood amased,
hearing his voyce, but seeing no man.
8 And Saul arose from the ground, and
opened his eyes, but sawe no man. Then
led they him by the hand, and brought
him into Damascus, 9 Where he was three
dayes without sight, and neither ate nor
dranke. 10 And there was a certaine
disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and
to him sayd the Lord in a vision, Ana-
nias. And he sayd, Beholde, I am here
Lord. 11 Then the Lord sayd vnto him,Acts 9:12
957
Arise, and goe into the streete which is
called Straight, and seeke in the house of
Iudas after one called Saul of Tarsus: for
beholde, he prayeth. 12 (And he sawe in
a vision a man named Ananias comming
in to him, and putting his hands on him,
that he might receiue his sight.) 13 Then
Ananias answered, Lord, I haue heard by
many of this man, howe much euill hee
hath done to thy saints at Hierusalem.
14 Moreouer here hee hath authoritie of
the hie Priestes, to binde all that call on
thy Name. 15 Then the Lord said vnto him,
Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessell
vnto me, to beare my Name before the
Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of
Israel. 16 For I will shewe him, howe
many things he must suffer for my Names
sake. 17 Then Ananias went his way,
and entred into that house, and put his
hands on him, and sayd, Brother Saul,
the Lord hath sent me (euen Iesus that
appeared vnto thee in the way as thou
camest) that thou mightest receiue thy
sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost.
18 And immediately there fell from his
eyes as it had bene scales, and suddenly
he receiued sight, and arose, and was
baptized, 19 And receiued meate, and was
strengthened. So was Saul certaine dayes
with the disciples which were at Dam-
ascus. 20 And straightway hee preached
Christ in the Synagogues, that he was
that Sonne of God, 21 So that all that
heard him, were amased, and sayde, Is
not this hee, that made hauocke of them
which called on this Name in Hierusalem,
and came hither for that intent, that hee
should bring them bound vnto the hie
Priests? 22 But Saul encreased the more
in strength, and confounded the Iewes
which dwelt at Damascus, confirming,
that this was that Christ. 23 And after
that many dayes were fulfilled, the Iewes
tooke counsell together, to kill him, 24 But
their laying awayte was knowen of Saul:
nowe they watched the gates day and
night, that they might kill him. 25 Then the
disciples tooke him by night, and put him
through the wall, and let him downe by a
rope in a basket. 26 And when Saul was
Acts 9:40
come to Hierusalem, he assayed to ioyne
himselfe with the disciples: but they were
all afrayd of him, and beleeued not that
he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas tooke
him, and brought him to the Apostles, and
declared to them, howe hee had seene
the Lord in the way, and that hee had
spoken vnto him, and how he had spoken
boldly at Damascus in the Name of Iesus.
28 And hee was conuersant with them at
Hierusalem, 29 And spake boldly in the
Name of the Lord Iesus, and spake and
disputed against the Grecians: but they
went about to slay him. 30 But when the
brethren knewe it, they brought him to
Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
31 Then had the Churches rest through all
Iudea, and Galile, and Samaria, and were
edified and walked in the feare of the
Lord, and were multiplied by the comfort
of the holy Ghost. 32 And it came to passe,
as Peter walked throughout all quarters,
hee came also to the saints which dwelt at
Lydda. 33 And there he found a certaine
man named Aeneas, which had kept his
couch eight yeeres, and was sicke of the
34 Then said Peter vnto him,
palsie.
Aeneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole:
arise and trusse thy couch together. And
he arose immediately. 35 And all that
dwelt at Lydda and Saron, sawe him, and
turned to the Lord. 36 There was also at
Ioppa a certaine woman, a disciple named
Tabitha (which by interpretation is called
Dorcas) she was full of good workes and
almes which she did. 37 And it came to
passe in those dayes, that she was sicke
and dyed: and when they had washed
her, they layd her in an vpper chamber.
38 Now forasmuch as Lydda was neere to
Ioppa, and the disciples had heard that
Peter was there, they sent vnto him two
men, desiring that he would not delay
to come vnto them. 39 Then Peter arose
and came with them: and when hee was
come, they brought him into the vpper
chamber, where all the widowes stoode
by him weeping, and shewing the coates
and garments, which Dorcas made, while
she was with them. 40 But Peter put them
all forth, and kneeled downe, and prayed,
and turned him to the body, and sayd,Acts 9:41
958
Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes,
and when she sawe Peter, sate vp. 41 Then
he gaue her the hand and lift her vp,
and called the Saints and widowes, and
restored her aliue. 42 And it was knowen
throughout all Ioppa, and many beleeued
in the Lord. 43 And it came to passe that
he taried many dayes in Ioppa with one
Simon a Tanner.
10
1 Futhermore there was a certaine man
in Cesarea called Cornelius, a captaine
of the band called the Italian band, 2 A
deuoute man, and one that feared God
with all his housholde, which gaue much
almes to the people, and prayed God con-
tinually. 3 He sawe in a vision euidently
(about the ninth houre of the day) an
Angel of God comming in to him, and
saying vnto him, Cornelius. 4 But when
hee looked on him, hee was afrayd, and
sayd, What is it, Lord? and he sayd
vnto him, Thy prayers and thine almes
are come vp into remembrance before
God. 5 Nowe therefore send men to Ioppa,
and call for Simon, whose surname is
Peter. 6 Hee lodgeth with one Simon a
Tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he
shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe.
7 And when the Angel which spake vnto
Cornelius, was departed, he called two of
his seruants, and a souldier that feared
God, one of them that waited on him,
8 And tolde them all things, and sent them
to Ioppa. 9 On the morow as they went
on their iourney, and drew neere vnto
the citie, Peter went vp vpon the house
to pray, about the sixt houre. 10 Then
waxed hee an hungred, and would haue
eaten: but while they made some thing
11 And
ready, he fell into a trance.
hee sawe heauen opened, and a certaine
vessell come downe vnto him, as it had
bene a great sheete, knit at the foure
corners, and was let downe to the earth.
12 Wherein were all maner of foure footed
beastes of the earth, and wilde beastes
and creeping things, and foules of the
heauen. 13 And there came a voyce to
him, Arise, Peter: kill, and eate. 14 But
Peter sayd, Not so, Lord: for I haue
Acts 10:30
neuer eaten any thing that is polluted,
or vncleane. 15 And the voyce spake
vnto him againe the second time, The
things that God hath purified, pollute thou
not. 16 This was so done thrise: and
the vessell was drawen vp againe into
heauen. 17 Nowe while Peter douted in
himselfe what this vision which he had
seene, meant, beholde, the men which
were sent from Cornelius, had inquired
for Simons house, and stoode at the gate,
18 And called, and asked, whether Simon,
which was surnamed Peter, were lodged
there. 19 And while Peter thought on the
vision, the Spirit sayde vnto him, Beholde,
three men seeke thee. 20 Arise therefore,
and get thee downe, and goe with them,
and doute nothing: For I haue sent them.
21 Then Peter went downe to the men,
which were sent vnto him from Cornelius,
and sayd, Beholde, I am he whome ye
seeke: what is the cause wherefore ye
are come? 22 And they sayd, Cornelius
the captaine, a iust man, and one that
feareth God, and of good report among
all the nation of the Iewes, was warned
from heauen by an holy Angel, to send
for thee into his house, and to heare thy
wordes. 23 Then called he them in, and
lodged them, and the next day, Peter went
foorth with them, and certaine brethren
from Ioppa accompanied him. 24 And
the day after, they entred into Cesarea.
Nowe Cornelius waited for them, and had
called together his kinsemen, and special
friends. 25 And it came to passe as Peter
came in, that Cornelius met him, and
fell downe at his feete, and worshipped
him. 26 But Peter tooke him vp, saying,
Stand vp: for euen I my selfe am a man.
27 And as he talked with him, he came in,
and found many that were come together.
28 And he sayd vnto them, Ye know that
it is an vnlawfull thing for a man that is
a Iewe, to company, or come vnto one of
another nation: but God hath shewed me,
that I should not call any man polluted,
or vncleane. 29 Therefore came I vnto
you without saying nay, when I was sent
for. I aske therefore, for what intent
haue ye sent for me? 30 Then Cornelius
sayd, Foure dayes agoe, about this houre,Acts 10:31
959
I fasted, and at the ninth houre I prayed
in mine house, and beholde, a man stood
before me in bright clothing, 31 And sayd,
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine
almes are had in remembrance in the
sight of God. 32 Send therefore to Ioppa,
and call for Simon, whose surname is
Peter (he is lodged in the house of Simon
a Tanner by the sea side) who when he
commeth, shall speake vnto thee. 33 Then
sent I for thee immediately, and thou hast
well done to come. Nowe therefore are
we all here present before God, to heare
all things that are commanded thee of
God. 34 Then Peter opened his mouth,
and sayd, Of a trueth I perceiue, that
God is no accepter of persons. 35 But
in euery nation he that feareth him,
and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted
with him. 36 Ye know the worde which
God hath sent to the children of Israel,
preaching peace by Iesus Christ, which is
Lord of all: 37 Euen the worde which came
through all Iudea, beginning in Galile,
after the baptisme which Iohn preached.
38 To wit, howe God anointed Iesus of
Nazareth with the holy Ghost, and with
power: who went about doing good, and
healing all that were oppressed of the
deuill: for God was with him. 39 And
we are witnesses of all things which he
did both in the land of the Iewes, and in
Hierusalem, whom they slewe, hanging
him on a tree. 40 Him God raysed vp the
third day, and caused that he was shewed
openly: 41 Not to all the people, but vnto
the witnesses chosen before of God, euen
to vs which did eate and drinke with him,
after he arose from the dead. 42 And he
commanded vs to preach vnto the people,
and to testifie, that it is he that is ordained
of God a iudge of quicke and dead. 43 To
him also giue all the Prophets witnesse,
that through his Name all that beleeue
in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes.
44 While Peter yet spake these wordes, the
holy Ghost fell on al them which heard
the word. 45 So they of the circumcision
which beleeued, were astonied, as many
as came with Peter, because that on the
Gentiles also was powred out the gift of
the holy Ghost. 46 For they heard them
Acts 11:15
speake with tongues, and magnifie God.
Then answered Peter, 47 Can any man
forbid water, that these should not be
baptized, which haue receiued the holy
Ghost, as well as we? 48 So he commanded
them to be baptized in the Name of the
Lord. Then prayed they him to tary
certaine dayes.
11
1 Nowe the Apostles and the brethren
that were in Iudea, heard, that the Gen-
tiles had also receiued the worde of
God. 2 And when Peter was come vp
to Hierusalem, they of the circumcision
contended against him, 3 Saying, Thou
wentest in to men vncircumcised, and
4 Then Peter
hast eaten with them.
beganne, and expounded the thing in
order to them, saying, 5 I was in the citie of
Ioppa, praying, and in a trance I sawe this
vision, A certaine vessell comming downe
as it had bene a great sheete, let downe
from heauen by the foure corners, and it
came to me. 6 Towarde the which when I
had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and
sawe foure footed beastes of the earth,
and wilde beastes, and creeping things,
and foules of the heauen. 7 Also I heard
a voyce, saying vnto me, Arise, Peter:
slay and eate. 8 And I said, God forbid,
Lord: for nothing polluted or vncleane
hath at any time entred into my mouth.
9 But the voyce answered me the seconde
time from heauen, The things that God
hath purified, pollute thou not. 10 And
this was done three times, and all were
taken vp againe into heauen. 11 Then
behold, immediatly there were three men
already come vnto the house where I was,
sent from Cesarea vnto me. 12 And the
Spirit saide vnto me, that I should go
with them, without doubting: moreouer
these sixe brethren came with me, and
we entred into the mans house. 13 And
he shewed vs, howe he had seene an
Angel in his house, which stoode and said
to him, Send men to Ioppa, and call for
Simon, whose surname is Peter. 14 He
shall speake wordes vnto thee, whereby
both thou and all thine house shalbe
saued. 15 And as I began to speake,Acts 11:16
960
the holy Ghost fell on them, euen as
vpon vs at the beginning. 16 Then I
remembred the word of the Lord, howe
he said, Iohn baptized with water, but
ye shalbe baptized with the holy Ghost.
17 For as much then as God gaue them
a like gift, as he did vnto vs, when we
beleeued in the Lord Iesus Christ, who
was I, that I coulde let God? 18 When
they heard these things, they helde their
peace, and glorified God, saying, Then
hath God also to the Gentiles graunted
repentance vnto life. 19 And they which
were scattered abroade because of the
affliction that arose about Steuen, went
throughout till they came vnto Phenice
and Cyprus, and Antiochia, preaching the
worde to no man, but vnto the Iewes
onely. 20 Now some of them were men of
Cyprus and of Cyrene, which when they
were come into Antiochia, spake vnto the
Grecians, and preached the Lord Iesus.
21 And the hand of the Lord was with
them, so that a great number beleeued
and turned vnto the Lord. 22 Then tydings
of those things came vnto the eares of
the Church, which was in Hierusalem,
and they sent foorth Barnabas, that he
should goe vnto Antiochia. 23 Who when
he was come and had seene the grace of
God, was glad, and exhorted all, that with
purpose of heart they would continue in
the Lord. 24 For he was a good man,
and full of the holy Ghost, and faith, and
much people ioyned them selues vnto
the Lord. 25 Then departed Barnabas to
Tarsus to seeke Saul: 26 And when he
had founde him, he brought him vnto
Antiochia: and it came to passe that a
whole yere they were conuersant with ye
Church, and taught much people, in so
much that the disciples were first called
Christians in Antiochia. 27 In those dayes
also came Prophets from Hierusalem vnto
Antiochia. 28 And there stoode vp one
of them named Agabus, and signified
by the Spirit, that there should be great
famine throughout all the world, which
also came to passe vnder Claudius Ce-
sar. 29 Then the disciples, euery man
according to his ability, purposed to sende
Acts 12:12
succour vnto the brethren which dwelt
in Iudea. 30 Which thing they also did,
and sent it to the Elders, by the hand of
Barnabas and Saul.
12
Nowe about that time, Herod the
King stretched forth his hands to vexe
certaine of the Church, 2 And he killed
Iames the brother of Iohn with the sword.
3 And when he sawe that it pleased the
Iewes, he proceeded further, to take Peter
also (then were the dayes of vnleauened
bread.) 4 And when he had caught him,
he put him in prison, and deliuered him
to foure quaternions of souldiers to be
kept, intending after the Passeouer to
bring him foorth to the people. 5 So
Peter was kept in prison, but earnest
prayer was made of ye Church vnto God
6 And when Herod woulde
for him.
haue brought him out vnto the people,
the same night slept Peter betweene two
souldiers, bound with two chaines, and
the keepers before the doore, kept the
prison. 7 And behold the Angel of the Lord
came vpon them, and a light shined in
the house, and he smote Peter on the side,
and raysed him vp, saying, Arise quickely.
And his chaines fell off from his handes.
8 And the Angel saide vnto him, Girde thy
selfe, and binde on thy sandales. And
so he did. Then he said vnto him, Cast
thy garment about thee, and follow me.
9 So Peter came out and followed him,
and knewe not that it was true, which
was done by the Angel, but thought he
had seene a vision. 10 Nowe when they
were past the first and the second watch,
they came vnto the yron gate, that leadeth
vnto the citie, which opened to them by
it owne accord, and they went out, and
passed through one streete, and by and
by the Angel departed from him. 11 And
when Peter was come to himselfe, he said,
Nowe I know for a trueth, that the Lord
hath sent his Angel, and hath deliuered
me out of the hand of Herod, and from
all the wayting for of the people of the
Iewes. 12 And as he considered the thing,
he came to the house of Marie, the mother
of Iohn, whose surname was Marke,
1Acts 12:13
961
where many were gathered together, and
prayed. 13 And when Peter knocked at
the entrie doore, a maide came foorth
to hearken, named Rhode, 14 But when
she knew Peters voyce, she opened not
the entrie doore for gladnesse, but ranne
in, and tolde howe Peter stood before the
entrie. 15 But they said vnto her, Thou art
mad. Yet she affirmed it constantly, that
it was so. Then said they, It is his Angel.
16 But Peter continued knocking, and
when they had opened it, and sawe him,
they were astonied. 17 And he beckened
vnto them with the hand, to hold their
peace, and told them how the Lord had
brought him out of the prison. And he
saide, Goe shewe these things vnto Iames
and to the brethren: and he departed and
went into an other place. 18 Nowe assoone
as it was day, there was no small trouble
among the souldiers, what was become
of Peter. 19 And when Herod had sought
for him, and found him not, he examined
the keepers, and commanded them to be
led to be punished. And he went downe
from Iudea to Cesarea, and there abode.
20 Then Herod was angrie with them of
Tyrus and Sidon, but they came all with
one accord vnto him, and perswaded
Blastus the Kings Chamberlaine, and they
desired peace, because their countrey
was nourished by the Kings land. 21 And
vpon a day appointed, Herod arayed
himselfe in royall apparell, and sate on
the iudgement seate, and made an oration
vnto them. 22 And the people gaue a
shoute, saying, The voyce of God, and not
of man. 23 But immediatly the Angel of
the Lord smote him, because he gaue not
glorie vnto God, so that he was eaten of
wormes, and gaue vp the ghost. 24 And
the worde of God grewe, and multiplied.
25 So Barnabas and Saul returned from
Hierusalem, when they had fulfilled their
office, and tooke with them Iohn, whose
surname was Marke.
Acts 13:15
Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Man-
ahen (which had bin brought vp with
Herod the Tetrarche) and Saul. 2 Nowe as
they ministred to the Lord, and fasted, the
holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas
and Saul, for the worke whereunto I haue
called them. 3 Then fasted they and
prayed, and layde their hands on them,
and let them goe. 4 And they, after they
were sent foorth of the holy Ghost, came
downe vnto Seleucia, and from thence
they sayled to Cyprus. 5 And when they
were at Salamis, they preached the worde
of God in the Synagogues of the Iewes:
and they had also Iohn to their minister.
6 So when they had gone throughout the
yle vnto Paphus, they found a certaine
sorcerer, a false prophet, being a Iewe,
named Bariesus, 7 Which was with the
Deputie Sergius Paulus, a prudent man.
He called vnto him Barnabas and Saul,
and desired to heare the woorde of God.
8 But Elymas, ye sorcerer (for so is his
name by interpretation) withstoode them,
and sought to turne away the Deputie
from the faith. 9 Then Saul (which also is
called Paul) being full of the holy Ghost,
set his eyes on him, 10 And sayde, O
full of all subtiltie and all mischiefe, the
childe of the deuill, and enemie of all
righteousnesse, wilt thou not cease to
peruert the straight waies of the Lord?
11 Nowe therefore behold, the hand of
the Lord is vpon thee, and thou shalt
be blinde, and not see the sunne for a
season. And immediately there fel on him
a mist and a darknes; and he went about,
seeking some to leade him by the hand.
12 Then the Deputie when he sawe what
was done, beleeued, and was astonied at
the doctrine of the Lord. 13 Nowe when
Paul and they that were with him were
departed by shippe from Paphus, they
came to Perga a citie of Pamphylia: then
Iohn departed from them, and returned
to Hierusalem. 14 But when they departed
from Perga, they came to Antiochia a citie
of Pisidia, and went into the Synagogue on
ye Sabbath day, and sate downe. 15 And
13
1 There were also in the Church that after the lecture of the Law and Prophets,
was at Antiochia, certaine Prophets and the rulers of ye Synagogue sent vnto
teachers, as Barnabas, and Simeon calledActs 13:16
962
them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if
ye haue any word of exhortation for the
people, say on. 16 Then Paul stoode vp and
beckened with the hand, and sayde, Men
of Israel, and yee that feare God, hearken.
17 The God of this people of Israel chose
our fathers, and exalted the people when
they dwelt in the land of Egypt, and with
an high arme brought them out thereof.
18 And about the time of fourtie yeeres,
suffered he their maners in the wilder-
nesse. 19 And he destroied seuen nations
in the land of Chanaan, and deuided their
lad to them by lot. 20 Then afterward
he gaue vnto them Iudges about foure
hundreth and fiftie yeeres, vnto the time
of Samuel the Prophet. 21 So after that,
they desired a King, and God gaue vnto
them Saul, the sonne of Cis, a man of
ye tribe of Beniamin, by the space of
fourty yeres. 22 And after he had taken
him away, he raised vp Dauid to be their
King, of whom he witnessed, saying, I
haue found Dauid the sonne of Iesse, a
man after mine owne heart, which will
doe all things that I will. 23 Of this mans
seede hath God according to his promise
raised vp to Israel, ye Sauiour Iesus:
24 When Iohn had first preached before
his coming the baptisme of repentance
to all the people of Israel. 25 And when
Iohn had fulfilled his course, he saide,
Whom ye thinke that I am, I am not he:
but beholde, there commeth one after
me, whose shooe of his feete I am not
worthy to loose. 26 Yee men and brethren,
children of the generation of Abraham,
and whosoeuer among you feareth God,
to you is the woorde of this saluation
sent. 27 For the inhabitants of Hierusalem,
and their rulers, because they knewe him
not, nor yet the woordes of the Prophets,
which are read euery Sabbath day, they
haue fulfilled them in condemning him.
28 And though they found no cause of
death in him, yet desired they Pilate to
kill him. 29 And when they had fulfilled
all things that were written of him, they
tooke him downe from the tree, and put
him in a sepulchre. 30 But God raised
him vp from the dead. 31 And hee was
Acts 13:46
seene many dayes of them, which came
vp with him from Galile to Hierusalem,
which are his witnesses vnto the people.
32 And we declare vnto you, that touching
the promise made vnto the fathers, 33 God
hath fulfilled it vnto vs their children,
in that he raised vp Iesus, euen as it is
written in the seconde Psalme, Thou art
my Sonne: this day haue I begotten thee.
34 Nowe as concerning that he raised him
vp from the dead, no more to returne to
corruption, he hath said thus, I wil giue
you the holy things of Dauid, which are
faithfull. 35 Wherefore hee sayeth also in
another place, Thou wilt not suffer thine
Holy one to see corruption. 36 Howbeit,
Dauid after hee had serued his time by the
counsell of God, hee slept, and was laid
with his fathers, and sawe corruption.
37 But he whom God raised vp, sawe
no corruption. 38 Be it knowen vnto
you therefore, men and brethren, that
through this man is preached vnto you
the forgiuenesse of sinnes. 39 And from
al things, from which ye could not be ius-
tified by the Law of Moses, by him euery
one that beleeueth, is iustified. 40 Beware
therefore lest that come vpon you, which
is spoken of in the Prophets, 41 Behold, ye
despisers, and wonder, and vanish away:
for I woorke a woorke in your daies, a
woorke which yee shall not beleeue, if a
man would declare it you. 42 And when
they were come out of the Synagogue of
the Iewes, the Gentiles besought, that they
woulde preach these woordes to them
the next Sabbath day. 43 Nowe when
the congregation was dissolued, many of
the Iewes and Proselytes that feared God,
followed Paul and Barnabas, which spake
to them, and exhorted them to continue in
the grace of God. 44 And ye next Sabbath
day came almost the whole citie together,
to heare the worde of God. 45 But when
the Iewes saw the people, they were full
of enuie, and spake against those things,
which were spoken of Paul, contrarying
them, and railing on them. 46 Then Paul
and Barnabas spake boldly, and sayde, It
was necessarie that the woorde of God
shoulde first haue beene spoken vnto you:Acts 13:47
963
but seeing yee put it from you, and iudge
your selues vnworthie of euerlasting life,
loe, we turne to the Gentiles. 47 For so
hath the Lord commanded vs, saying, I
haue made thee a light of the Gentiles,
that thou shouldest be the saluation vnto
the end of the world. 48 And when the
Gentiles heard it, they were glad, and
glorified the woorde of the Lord: and
as many as were ordeined vnto eternall
life, beleeued. 49 Thus the worde of the
Lord was published throughout the whole
countrey. 50 But the Iewes stirred certaine
deuoute and honourable women, and the
chiefe men of the citie, and raised per-
secution against Paul and Barnabas, and
expelled them out of their coastes. 51 But
they shooke off the dust of their feete
against them, and came vnto Iconium.
52 And the disciples were filled with ioy,
and with the holy Ghost.
1 And
14
it came to passe in Iconium,
that they went both together into the
Synagogue of the Iewes, and so spake,
that a great multitude both of the Iewes
and of the Grecians beleeued. 2 And the
vnbeleeuing Iewes stirred vp, and cor-
rupted the mindes of the Gentiles against
the brethren. 3 So therefore they abode
there a long time, and spake boldly in
the Lord, which gaue testimonie vnto the
woord of his grace, and caused signes and
woders to be done by their hands. 4 But
the multitude of the city was deuided:
and some were with the Iewes, and some
with the Apostles. 5 And when there
was an assault made both of the Gentiles,
and of the Iewes with their rulers, to
doe them violence, and to stone them,
6 They were ware of it, and fled vnto
Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and
vnto the region round about, 7 And there
preached the Gospel. 8 Nowe there sate
a certaine man at Lystra, impotent in
his feete, which was a creeple from his
mothers wombe, who had neuer walked.
9 He heard Paul speake: who beholding
him, and perceiuing that he had faith to
be healed, 10 Said with a loude voyce,
Acts 14:24
Stand vpright on thy feete.
And he
leaped vp, and walked. 11 Then when
the people sawe what Paul had done,
they lift vp their voyces, saying in ye
speach of Lycaonia, Gods are come downe
to vs in the likenesse of men. 12 And
they called Barnabas, Iupiter: and Paul,
Mercurius, because hee was the chiefe
speaker. 13 Then Iupiters priest, which
was before their citie, brought bulles with
garlands vnto the gates, and would haue
sacrificed with the people. 14 But when
the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard
it, they rent their clothes, and ran in
among the people, crying, 15 And saying,
O men, why doe yee these things? We
are euen men subiect to the like passions
that yee be, and preache vnto you, that
yee shoulde turne from these vaine things
vnto the liuing God, which made heauen
and earth, and the sea, and all things that
in them are: 16 Who in times past suffered
all the Gentiles to walke in their owne
waies. 17 Neuerthelesse, hee left not him
selfe without witnes, in that hee did good
and gaue vs raine from heauen, and fruit-
ful seasons, filling our hearts with foode,
and gladnesse. 18 And speaking these
things, scarce appeased they the multi-
tude, that they had not sacrificed vnto
them. 19 Then there came certaine Iewes
from Antiochia and Iconium, which when
they had persuaded the people, stoned
Paul, and drewe him out of the citie,
supposing he had bene dead. 20 Howbeit,
as the disciples stoode rounde about him,
hee arose vp, and came into the citie, and
the next day hee departed with Barnabas
to Derbe. 21 And after they had preached
the glad tidings of the Gospel to that citie,
and had taught many, they returned to
Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antiochia,
22 Confirming the disciples hearts, and
exhorting them to continue in the faith,
affirming that we must through many
afflictions enter into the kingdome of
God. 23 And when they had ordeined
them Elders by election in euery Church,
and prayed, and fasted, they commended
them to the Lord in whome they beleeued.
24 Thus they went throughout Pisidia, andActs 14:25
964
came to Pamphylia. 25 And when they had
preached the woorde in Perga, they came
downe to Attalia, 26 And thence sailed to
Antiochia, from whence they had bene
comended vnto the grace of God, to the
woorke, which they had fulfilled. 27 And
when they were come and had gathered
the Church together, they rehearsed all
the things that God had done by them, and
howe he had opened the doore of faith
vnto the Gentiles. 28 So there they abode
a long time with the disciples.
15
Then came downe certaine from
Iudea, and taught the brethren, saying,
Except ye be circumcised after the maner
of Moses, ye cannot be saued. 2 And
when there was great dissension, and
disputation by Paul and Barnabas against
them, they ordeyned that Paul and Barn-
abas, and certaine other of them, should
goe vp to Hierusalem vnto the Apostles
and Elders about this question. 3 Thus
being brought forth by ye Church, they
passed through Phenice and Samaria,
declaring the conuersion of the Gentiles,
and they brought great ioy vnto all the
brethren. 4 And when they were come
to Hierusalem, they were receiued of the
Church, and of the Apostles and Elders,
and they declared what things God had
done by them. 5 But said they, certaine
of the sect of the Pharises, which did
beleeue, rose vp, saying, that it was
needefull to circumcise them, and to com-
maund them to keepe the lawe of Moses.
6 Then the Apostles and Elders came
together to looke to this matter. 7 And
when there had bene great disputation,
Peter rose vp, and said vnto them, Ye men
and brethren, ye know that a good while
ago, among vs God chose out me, that
the Gentiles by my mouth should heare
the worde of the Gospel, and beleeue.
8 And God which knoweth the heartes,
bare them witnesse, in giuing vnto them
ye holy Ghost euen as he did vnto vs.
9 And he put no difference betweene vs
and them, after that by faith he had
purified their heartes. 10 Nowe therefore,
1
Acts 15:25
why tempt ye God, to lay a yoke on
the disciples neckes, which neither our
fathers, nor we were able to beare? 11 But
we beleeue, through the grace of the Lord
Iesus Christ to be saued, euen as they
doe. 12 Then all the multitude kept silence,
and heard Barnabas and Paul, which told
what signes and wonders God had done
among the Gentiles by them. 13 And when
they helde their peace, Iames answered,
saying, Men and brethren, hearken vnto
me. 14 Simeon hath declared, howe God
first did visite the Gentiles, to take of them
a people vnto his Name. 15 And to this
agree the woordes of the Prophets, as
it is written, 16 After this I will returne,
and will builde againe the tabernacle of
Dauid, which is fallen downe, and the ru-
ines thereof will I build againe, and I will
set it vp, 17 That the residue of men might
seeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles
vpon whom my Name is called, saith
the Lord which doeth all these things.
18 From the beginning of the worlde, God
knoweth all his workes. 19 Wherefore
my sentence is, that we trouble not them
of the Gentiles that are turned to God,
20 But that we send vnto them, that they
abstaine themselues from filthinesse of
idoles, and fornication, and that that
21 For
is strangled, and from blood.
Moses of olde time hath in euery citie
them that preache him, seeing he is read
in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day.
22 Then it seemed good to the Apostles and
Elders with the whole Church, to sende
chosen men of their owne companie to
Antiochia with Paul and Barnabas: to wit,
Iudas whose surname was Barsabas and
Silas, which were chiefe men among the
brethren, 23 And wrote letters by them
after this maner, THE APOSTLES, and
the Elders, and the brethren, vnto the
brethren which are of the Gentiles in
Antiochia, and in Syria, and in Cilicia,
send greeting. 24 Forasmuch as we haue
heard, that certaine which went out from
vs, haue troubled you with wordes, and
cumbred your mindes, saying, Ye must
be circumcised and keepe the Lawe: to
whom we gaue no such commandement,
25 It seemed therefore good to vs, whenActs 15:26
965
we were come together with one accord,
to send chosen men vnto you, with our
beloued Barnabas and Paul, 26 Men that
haue giuen vp their liues for the Name
of our Lord Iesus Christ. 27 We haue
therefore sent Iudas and Silas, which
shall also tell you ye same things by
mouth. 28 For it seemed good to the holy
Ghost, and to vs, to lay no more burden
vpon you, then these necessary things,
29 That is, that ye abstaine from things
offered to idoles, and blood, and that
that is strangled, and from fornication:
from which if ye keepe your selues, ye
shall doe well. Fare ye well. 30 Nowe
when they were departed, they came
to Antiochia, and after that they had
assembled the multitude, they deliuered
the Epistle. 31 And when they had read it,
they reioyced for the consolation. 32 And
Iudas and Silas being Prophets, exhorted
the brethren with many wordes, and
strengthened them. 33 And after they had
taried there a space, they were let goe in
peace of the brethren vnto the Apostles.
34 Notwithstanding Silas thought good to
abide there still. 35 Paul also and Barn-
abas continued in Antiochia, teaching and
preaching with many other, the worde
of the Lord. 36 But after certaine dayes,
Paul said vnto Barnabas, Let vs returne,
and visite our brethren in euery citie,
where we haue preached the worde of
the Lord, and see how they doe. 37 And
Barnabas counselled to take with them
Iohn, called Marke. 38 But Paul thought
it not meete to take him vnto their com-
panie, which departed from them from
Pamphylia, and went not with them to
the worke. 39 Then were they so stirred,
that they departed asunder one from the
other, so that Barnabas tooke Marke, and
sailed vnto Cyprus. 40 And Paul chose
Silas and departed, being commended
of the brethren vnto the grace of God.
41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia,
stablishing the Churches.
Acts 16:15
named Timotheus, a womans sonne,
which was a Iewesse and beleeued, but
his father was a Grecian, 2 Of whom
the brethren which were at Lystra and
Iconium, reported well. 3 Therefore Paul
would that he should go forth with him,
and tooke and circumcised him, because
of ye Iewes, which were in those quarters:
for they knewe all, that his father was
a Grecian. 4 And as they went through
the cities, they deliuered them the decrees
to keepe, ordeined of the Apostles and
Elders, which were at Hierusalem. 5 And
so were the Churches stablished in the
faith, and encreased in number daily.
6 Nowe when they had gone through-
out Phrygia, and the region of Galatia,
they were forbidden of the holy Ghost
to preache the worde in Asia. 7 Then
came they to Mysia, and sought to go
into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them
not. 8 Therefore they passed through
Mysia, and came downe to Troas, 9 Where
a vision appeared to Paul in the night.
There stoode a man of Macedonia, and
prayed him, saying, Come into Macedo-
nia, and helpe vs. 10 And after he had
seene the vision, immediatly we prepared
to goe into Macedonia, being assured that
the Lord had called vs to preache the
Gospel vnto them. 11 Then went we forth
from Troas, and with a straight course
came to Samothracia, and the next day to
Neapolis, 12 And from thence to Philippi,
which is the chiefe citie in ye partes
of Macedonia, and whose inhabitants
came from Rome to dwell there, and we
were in that citie abiding certaine dayes.
13 And on the Sabbath day, we went
out of the citie, besides a Riuer, where
they were wont to pray: and we sate
downe, and spake vnto the women, which
were come together. 14 And a certaine
woman named Lydia, a seller of purple,
of the citie of the Thyatirians, which
worshipped God, heard vs: whose heart
the Lord opened, that she attended vnto
the things, which Paul spake. 15 And when
she was baptized, and her houshold, she
16
1 Then came he to Derbe and to Lystra: besought vs, saying, If ye haue iudged
and beholde, a certaine disciple was there me to be faithfull to ye Lord, come intoActs 16:16
mine house, and abide there: and she
constrained vs. 16 And it came to passe
that as we went to prayer, a certaine
maide hauing a spirit of diuination, mette
vs, which gate her masters much vantage
with diuining. 17 She followed Paul and
vs, and cryed, saying, These men are the
seruants of the most high God, which
shewe vnto you the way of saluation.
18 And this did she many dayes: but Paul
being grieued, turned about, and said to
the spirit, I commaund thee in the Name
of Iesus Christ, that thou come out of
her. And he came out the same houre.
19 Nowe when her masters sawe that the
hope of their gaine was gone, they caught
Paul and Silas, and drewe them into the
market place vnto the Magistrates, 20 And
brought them to the gouernours, saying,
These men which are Iewes, trouble our
citie, 21 And preache ordinances, which
are not lawfull for vs to receiue, neither to
obserue, seeing we are Romanes. 22 The
people also rose vp together against them,
and the gouernours rent their clothes,
and commanded them to be beaten with
roddes. 23 And when they had beaten
them sore, they cast them into prison,
commaunding the Iayler to keepe them
surely. 24 Who hauing receiued such
commandement, cast them into the inner
prison, and made their feete fast in the
stockes. 25 Nowe at midnight Paul and
Silas prayed, and sung Psalmes vnto God:
and the prisoners heard them. 26 And
suddenly there was a great earthquake,
so that the foundation of the prison was
shaken: and by and by all the doores
opened, and euery mans bands were
loosed. 27 Then the keeper of the prison
waked out of his sleepe, and when he
sawe the prison doores open, he drewe
out his sword and would haue killed
himselfe, supposing the prisoners had bin
fled. 28 But Paul cryed with a loude voyce,
saying, Doe thy selfe no harme: for we
are all here. 29 Then he called for a light,
and leaped in, and came trembling, and
fell downe before Paul and Silas, 30 And
brought them out, and said, Syrs, what
must I doe to be saued? 31 And they saide,
966
Acts 17:5
Beleeue in the Lord Iesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saued, and thine houshold.
32 And they preached vnto him the worde
of the Lord, and to all that were in the
house. 33 Afterwarde he tooke them the
same houre of the night, and washed their
stripes, and was baptized with all that
belonged vnto him, straigthway. 34 And
when he had brought them into his house,
he set meate before them, and reioyced
that he with all his houshold beleeued
in God. 35 And when it was day, the
gouernours sent the sergeants, saying,
Let those men goe. 36 Then the keeper
of the prison tolde these woordes vnto
Paul, saying, The gouerness haue sent
to loose you: nowe therefore get you
hence, and goe in peace. 37 Then sayde
Paul vnto them, After that they haue
beaten vs openly vncodemned, which are
Romanes, they haue cast vs into prison,
and nowe would they put vs out priuily?
nay verely: but let them come and bring
vs out. 38 And the sergeants tolde these
woordes vnto the gouernours, who feared
whe they heard that they were Romanes.
39 Then came they and praied them, and
brought them out, and desired them to
depart out of the citie. 40 And they went
out of the prison, and entred into the
house of Lydia: and when they had seene
the brethren, they comforted them, and
departed.
1 Nowe
17
as they passed through Am-
phipolis, and Apollonia, they came to
Thessalonica, where was a Synagogue of
the Iewes. 2 And Paul, as his maner
was, went in vnto them, and three Sab-
bath daies disputed with them by the
Scriptures, 3 Opening, and alleadging that
Christ must haue suffered, and risen
againe from the dead: and this is Iesus
Christ, whom, said he, I preach to you.
4 And some of them beleeued, and ioyned
in companie with Paul and Silas: also
of the Grecians that feared God a great
multitude, and of the chiefe women not
a fewe. 5 But the Iewes which beleeued
not, mooued with enuie, tooke vnto themActs 17:6
967
certaine vagabonds and wicked fellowes,
and whe they had assembled the mul-
titude, they made a tumult in the citie,
and made assault against the house of
Iason, and sought to bring them out
to the people. 6 But when they found
them not, they drew Iason and certaine
brethren vnto the heads of the citie, cry-
ing, These are they which haue subuerted
the state of the world, and here they are,
7 Whom Iason hath receiued, and these all
doe against the decrees of Cesar, saying
that there is another King, one Iesus.
8 Then they troubled the people, and the
heads of the citie, when they heard these
things. 9 Notwithstanding when they had
receiued sufficient assurance of Iason and
of the other, they let them goe. 10 And the
brethren immediatly sent away Paul and
Silas by night vnto Berea, which when
they were come thither, entred into ye
Synagogue of the Iewes. 11 These were
also more noble men then they which
were at Thessalonica, which receiued the
woorde with all readinesse, and searched
the Scriptures daily, whether those things
were so. 12 Therefore many of them
beleeued, and of honest women, which
were Grecians, and men not a fewe. 13 But
when the Iewes of Thessalonica knewe,
that the woord of God was also preached
of Paul at Berea, they came thither also,
and mooued the people. 14 But by and
by the brethren sent away Paul to goe
as it were to the sea: but Silas and
Timotheus abode there still. 15 And they
that did conduct Paul, brought him vnto
Athens: and when they had receiued a
commandement vnto Silas and Timotheus
that they shoulde come to him at once,
they departed. 16 Nowe while Paul waited
for them at Athens, his spirite was stirred
in him, when hee sawe the citie subiect
to idolatrie. 17 Therefore he disputed
in the Synagogue with the Iewes, and
with them that were religious, and in
the market daily with whomesoeuer he
met. 18 Then certaine Philosophers of the
Epicures, and of the Stoickes, disputed
with him, and some sayde, What will this
babler say? Others sayde, He seemeth to
Acts 17:31
be a setter forth of straunge gods (because
hee preached vnto them Iesus, and the
resurrection.) 19 And they tooke him, and
brought him into Mars streete, saying,
May we not know, what this newe doc-
trine, whereof thou speakest, is? 20 For
thou bringest certaine strange thinges
vnto our eares: we woulde knowe there-
fore, what these things meane. 21 For
all the Athenians, and strangers which
dwelt there, gaue them selues to nothing
els, but either to tell, or to heare some
newes. 22 Then Paul stoode in the mids
of Mars streete, and sayde, Yee men
of Athens, I perceiue that in all things
yee are too superstitious. 23 For as I
passed by, and behelde your deuotions,
I founde an altar wherein was written,
VNTO THE VNKNOWEN GOD. Whom ye
then ignorantly worship, him shewe I
vnto you. 24 God that made the world, and
all things that are therein, seeing that he
is Lord of heaue and earth, dwelleth not
in temples made with hands, 25 Neither is
worshipped with mens handes, as though
he needed any thing, seeing hee giueth to
all life and breath and all things, 26 And
hath made of one blood all mankinde,
to dwell on all the face of the earth,
and hath assigned the seasons which
were ordeined before, and the boundes
of their habitation, 27 That they shoulde
seeke the Lord, if so be they might haue
groped after him, and founde him though
doubtlesse he be not farre from euery one
of vs. 28 For in him we liue, and mooue,
and haue our being, as also certaine of
your owne Poets haue sayd, for we are
also his generation. 29 Forasmuch then,
as we are the generation of God, we ought
not to thinke that ye Godhead is like vnto
gold, or siluer, or stone grauen by arte
and the inuention of man. 30 And the
time of this ignorance God regarded not:
but nowe hee admonisheth all men euery
where to repent, 31 Because hee hath
appoynted a day in the which he wil iudge
the world in righteousnes, by that man
whome hee hath appoynted, whereof he
hath giuen an assurance to all men, in
that hee hath raised him from the dead.Acts 17:32
968
32 Now when they heard of the resurrec-
tion from the dead, some mocked, and
other sayde, We will heare thee againe of
this thing. 33 And so Paul departed from
among them. 34 Howbeit certaine men
claue vnto Paul, and beleeued: among
whome was also Denys Areopagita, and a
woman named Damaris, and other with
them.
1 After
18
these thinges, Paul departed
from Athens, and came to Corinthus,
2 And found a certaine Iewe named
Aquila, borne in Pontus, lately come from
Italie, and his wife Priscilla (because that
Claudius had commanded all Iewes to
depart from Rome) and he came vnto
them. 3 And because hee was of the same
crafte, he abode with them and wrought
(for their crafte was to make tentes.)
4 And he disputed in the Synagogue euery
Sabbath day, and exhorted the Iewes,
and the Grecians. 5 Now when Silas and
Timotheus were come from Macedonia,
Paul, forced in spirit, testified to the Iewes
that Iesus was the Christ. 6 And when
they resisted and blasphemed, he shooke
his raiment, and saide vnto them, Your
blood be vpon your owne head: I am
cleane: from henceforth will I goe vnto
the Gentiles. 7 So he departed thence, and
entred into a certaine mans house, named
Iustus, a worshipper of God, whose house
ioyned hard to the Synagogue. 8 And
Crispus the chiefe ruler of the Syna-
gogue, beleeued in the Lord with all his
housholde: and many of the Corinthians
hearing it, beleeued and were baptized.
9 Then saide the Lord to Paul in the night
by a vision, Feare not, but speake, and
holde not thy peace. 10 For I am with thee,
and no man shall lay handes on thee to
hurt thee: for I haue much people in this
citie. 11 So he continued there a yeere and
six moneths, and taught ye worde of God
among them. 12 Now when Gallio was
Deputie of Achaia, the Iewes arose with
one accorde against Paul, and brought
him to the iudgement seate, 13 Saying,
This fellow persuadeth me to worship
God otherwise then the Lawe appointeth.
14 And
Acts 18:27
as Paul was about to open his
mouth, Gallio saide vnto the Iewes, If
it were a matter of wrong, or an euill
deede, O ye Iewes, I would according
to reason maintaine you. 15 But if it
bee a question of woordes, and names,
and of your Lawe, looke yee to it your
selues: for I will be no iudge of those
things. 16 And hee draue them from the
iudgement seate. 17 Then tooke al the
Grecians Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of
the Synagogue, and beat him before the
iudgement seat: but Gallio cared nothing
for those things. 18 But when Paul had
taried there yet a good while, hee tooke
leaue of the brethren, and sailed into
Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila)
after that he had shorne his head in
Cenchrea: for he had a vowe. 19 Then
hee came to Ephesus, and left them there:
but hee entred into the Synagogue and
disputed with the Iewes. 20 Who desired
him to tarie a longer time with them: but
he would not consent, 21 But bade the
farewel, saying, I must needes keepe this
feast that commeth, in Hierusalem: but I
will returne againe vnto you, if God will.
So he sailed from Ephesus. 22 And when
hee came downe to Cesarea, he went vp to
Hierusalem: and when he had saluted the
Church, he went downe vnto Antiochia.
23 Nowe when he had taried there a
while, he departed, and went thorowe the
countrey of Galatia and Phrygia by order,
strengthening all the disciples. 24 And a
certaine Iewe named Apollos, borne at
Alexandria, came to Ephesus, an eloquent
man, and mightie in the Scriptures. 25 The
same was instructed in the way of the
Lord, and hee spake feruently in the
Spirite, and taught diligently the things of
the Lord, and knew but the baptisme of
Iohn onely. 26 And he began to speake
boldely in the Synagogue. Whom when
Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they tooke
him vnto them, and expounded vnto him
the way of God more perfectly. 27 And
when hee was minded to goe into Achaia,
the brethren exhorting him, wrote to
the disciples to receiue him: and after
hee was come thither, he holpe themActs 18:28
969
much which had beleeued through grace.
28 For mightily hee confuted publikely the
Iewes, with great vehemencie, shewing
by the Scriptures, that Iesus was that
Christ.
19
1 And it came to passe, while Apollos
was at Corinthus, that Paul when he
passed thorow the vpper coasts, came
to Ephesus, and found certaine disciples,
2 And saide vnto them, Haue ye receiued
the holy Ghost since ye beleeued? And
they saide vnto him, Wee haue not so
much as heard whether there be an holy
Ghost. 3 And he said vnto them, Vnto what
were ye then baptized? And they saide,
Vnto Iohns baptisme. 4 Then saide Paul,
Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme
of repentance, saying vnto the people,
that they shoulde beleeue in him, which
should come after him, that is, in Christ
Iesus. 5 And when they heard it, they
were baptized in the Name of the Lord
Iesus. 6 So Paul layde his handes vpon
them, and the holy Ghost came on them,
and they spake the tongues, and prophe-
cied. 7 And all the men were about twelue.
8 Moreouer he went into the Synagogue,
and spake boldly for the space of three
moneths, disputing and exhorting to the
things that appertaine to the kingdome of
God. 9 But when certaine were hardened,
and disobeyed, speaking euill of the way
of God before the multitude, hee departed
from them, and separated the disciples,
and disputed dayly in the schoole of one
Tyrannus. 10 And this was done by the
space of two yeeres, so that all they
which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of
ye Lord Iesus, both Iewes and Grecians.
11 And God wrought no small miracles
by the handes of Paul, 12 So that from
his body were brought vnto the sicke,
kerchefs or handkerchefs, and the dis-
eases departed from them, and the euill
spirits went out of them. 13 Then certaine
of the vagabond Iewes, exorcistes, tooke
in hand to name ouer them which had
euil spirits, the Name of the Lord Iesus,
saying, We adiure you by Iesus, whom
Acts 19:28
Paul preacheth. 14 (And there were cer-
taine sonnes of Sceua a Iewe, the Priest,
about seuen which did this) 15 And the
euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I
acknowledge, and Paul I know: but who
are ye? 16 And the man in whome the euil
spirit was, ranne on them, and ouercame
them, and preuailed against them, so that
they fledde out of that house, naked, and
wounded. 17 And this was knowen to
all the Iewes and Grecians also, which
dwelt at Ephesus, and feare came on them
all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was
magnified, 18 And many that beleeued,
came and confessed, and shewed their
workes. 19 Many also of them which vsed
curious artes, brought their bookes, and
burned them before all men: and they
counted the price of them, and found
it fiftie thousand pieces of siluer. 20 So
the worde of God grewe mightily, and
preuailed. 21 Nowe when these things
were accomplished, Paul purposed by the
Spirite to passe through Macedonia and
Achaia, and to goe to Hierusalem, saying,
After I haue bene there, I must also see
Rome. 22 So sent hee into Macedonia
two of them that ministred vnto him,
Timotheus and Erastus, but he remained
in Asia for a season. 23 And the same
time there arose no small trouble about
that way. 24 For a certaine man named
Demetrius a siluersmith, which made
siluer temples of Diana, brought great
gaines vnto the craftesmen, 25 Whom he
called together, with the workemen of
like things, and saide, Syrs, ye knowe
that by this craft we haue our goods:
26 Moreouer ye see and heare, that not
alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout
all Asia this Paul hath perswaded, and
turned away much people, saying, That
they be not gods which are made with
handes. 27 So that not onely this thing is
dangerous vnto vs, that this our portion
shall be reproued, but also that the temple
of the great goddesse Diana should be
nothing esteemed, and that it would come
to passe that her magnificence, which all
Asia and the world worshippeth, should
be destroyed. 28 Now when they heardActs 19:29
970
it, they were full of wrath, and cried out,
saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
29 And the whole citie was full of confu-
sion, and they rushed into the common
place with one assent, and caught Gaius,
and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, and
Pauls companions of his iourney. 30 And
when Paul would haue entred in vnto
the people, the disciples suffred him not.
31 Certaine also of the chiefe of Asia which
were his friendes, sent vnto him, desiring
him that hee woulde not present him selfe
in the Common place. 32 Some therefore
cried one thing, and some another: for
the assemblie was out of order, and the
more part knewe not wherefore they
were come together. 33 And some of
the company drew foorth Alexander, the
Iewes thrusting him forwards. Alexan-
der then beckened with the hande, and
woulde haue excused the matter to the
people. 34 But when they knew that
he was a Iewe, there arose a shoute
almost for the space of two houres, of
all men crying, Great is Diana of the
Ephesians. 35 Then the towne clearke
when hee had stayed the people, saide,
Ye men of Ephesus, what man is it that
knoweth not howe that the citie of the
Ephesians is a worshipper of the great
goddesse Diana, and of the image, which
came downe from Iupiter? 36 Seeing then
that no man can speake against these
things, ye ought to be appeased, and
to doe nothing rashly. 37 For yee haue
brought hither these men, which haue
neither committed sacrilege, neither doe
blaspheme your goddesse. 38 Wherefore,
if Demetrius and the craftes men which
are with him, haue a matter against any
man, the lawe is open, and there are
Deputies: let them accuse one another.
39 But if ye inquire any thing cocerning
other matters, it may be determined in
a lawful assembly. 40 For we are euen
in ieopardie to be accused of this dayes
sedition, for as much as there is no cause,
whereby we may giue a reason of this
concourse of people. 41 And when he had
thus spoken, hee let the assembly depart.
Acts 20:15

1 Nowe after the tumult was appeased,
Paul called the disciples vnto him, and
embraced them, and departed to goe into
Macedonia. 2 And when hee had gone
through those parts, and had exhorted
them with many words, he came into
Grecia. 3 And hauing taried there three
moneths, because the Iewes layde waite
for him, as hee was about to saile into
Syria, hee purposed to returne through
Macedonia. 4 And there accompanied him
into Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of them of
Thessalonica, Aristarchus, and Secundus,
and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and
of them of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.
5 These went before, and taried vs at
Troas. 6 And we sailed forth from Philippi,
after the dayes of vnleauened bread, and
came vnto them to Troas in fiue dayes,
where we abode seuen dayes. 7 And
the first day of the weeke, the disciples
being come together to breake bread,
Paul preached vnto them, ready to de-
part on the morrow, and continued the
preaching vnto midnight. 8 And there
were many lightes in an vpper chamber,
where they were gathered together. 9 And
there sate in a windowe a certaine yong
man, named Eutychus, fallen into a dead
sleepe: and as Paul was long preaching,
hee ouercome with sleepe, fell downe
from the thirde loft, and was taken vp
dead. 10 But Paul went downe, and layde
himselfe vpon him, and embraced him,
saying, Trouble not your selues: for his
life is in him. 11 Then when Paul was
come vp againe, and had broken bread,
and eaten, hauing spoken a long while till
the dawning of the day, hee so departed.
12 And they brought the boye aliue, and
they were not a litle comforted. 13 Then
we went before to shippe, and sailed vnto
the citie Assos, that wee might receiue
Paul there: for so had hee appointed, and
would himselfe goe afoote. 14 Now when
he was come vnto vs to Assos, and we
had receiued him, we came to Mitylenes.
15 And wee sailed thence, and came the
next day ouer against Chios, and the next
day we arriued at Samos, and tarriedActs 20:16
at Trogyllium: the next day we came to
Miletum. 16 For Paul had determined to
saile by Ephesus, because hee woulde not
spend the time in Asia: for he hasted to
be, if hee could possible, at Hierusalem,
at the day of Pentecost. 17 Wherefore
from Miletum, hee sent to Ephesus, and
called the Elders of the Church. 18 Who
when they were come to him, hee said
vnto them, Ye know from the first day
that I came into Asia, after what maner
I haue bene with you at all seasons,
19 Seruing the Lord with all modestie, and
with many teares, and tentations, which
came vnto me by the layings awaite of the
Iewes, 20 And how I kept backe nothing
that was profitable, but haue shewed you,
and taught you openly and throughout
euery house, 21 Witnessing both to the
Iewes, and to the Grecians the repentance
towarde God, and faith toward our Lord
Iesus Christ. 22 And nowe beholde, I goe
bound in the Spirit vnto Hierusalem, and
know not what things shall come vnto me
there, 23 Saue that ye holy Ghost witnes-
seth in euery citie, saying, that bondes
and afflictions abide me. 24 But I passe
not at all, neither is my life deare vnto
my selfe, so that I may fulfill my course
with ioye, and the ministration which I
haue receiued of the Lord Iesus, to testifie
the Gospell of the grace of God. 25 And
now behold, I know that henceforth ye all,
through whome I haue gone preaching
the kingdome of God, shall see my face
no more. 26 Wherefore I take you to
recorde this day, that I am pure from
the blood of all men. 27 For I haue
kept nothing backe, but haue shewed you
all the counsell of God. 28 Take heede
therefore vnto your selues, and to all
the flocke, whereof the holy Ghost hath
made you Ouerseers, to feede the Church
of God, which hee hath purchased with
that his owne blood. 29 For I knowe this,
that after my departing shall grieuous
wolues enter in among you, not sparing
the flocke. 30 Moreouer of your owne
selues shall men arise speaking peruerse
thinges, to drawe disciples after them.
31 Therefore watche, and remember, that
971
Acts 21:8
by the space of three yeres I ceased not to
warne euery one, both night and day with
teares. 32 And nowe brethren, I commend
you to God, and to the worde of his grace,
which is able to build further, and to
giue you an inheritance, among all them,
which are sanctified. 33 I haue coueted
no mans siluer, nor gold, nor apparell.
34 Yea, ye knowe, that these handes haue
ministred vnto my necessities, and to
them that were with me. 35 I haue shewed
you all things, howe that so labouring,
ye ought to support the weake, and to
remember the wordes of the Lord Iesus,
howe that hee saide, It is a blessed thing to
giue, rather then to receiue. 36 And when
he had thus spoken, he kneeled downe,
and prayed with them all. 37 Then they
wept all abundantly, and fell on Pauls
necke, and kissed him, 38 Being chiefly
sorie for the words which he spake, That
they should see his face no more. And
they accompanied him vnto the shippe.
21
1 And as we launched forth, and were
departed from them, we came with a
straight course vnto Coos, and the day
following vnto the Rhodes, and from
thence vnto Patara. 2 And we found a
ship that went ouer vnto Phenice, and
went aboard, and set forth. 3 And whe
we had discouered Cyprus, we left it on
the left hand, and sailed toward Syria,
and arriued at Tyrus: for there the
ship vnladed ye burden. 4 And when
we had found disciples, we taried there
seuen dayes. And they told Paul through
the Spirit, that he should not goe vp
to Hierusalem. 5 But when the dayes
were ended, we departed and went our
way, and they all accompanied vs with
their wiues and children, euen out of
the citie: and we kneeling downe on
the shore, prayed. 6 Then when we had
embraced one another, we tooke ship,
and they returned home. 7 And when
we had ended the course from Tyrus,
we arriued at Ptolemais, and saluted the
brethren, and abode with them one day.
8 And the next day, Paul and we thatActs 21:9
972
were with him, departed, and came vnto
Cesarea: and we entred into the house of
Philippe the Euangelist, which was one
of the seuen Deacons, and abode with
9 Now he had foure daughters
him.
virgins, which did prophecie. 10 And as
we taried there many dayes, there came
a certaine Prophet from Iudea, named
Agabus. 11 And when he was come vnto
vs, he tooke Pauls girdle, and bound his
owne hands and feete, and sayd, Thus
sayth the holy Ghost, So shall the Iewes
at Hierusalem binde the man that oweth
this girdle, and shall deliuer him into the
hands of the Gentiles. 12 And when we
had heard these things, both we and other
of the same place besought him that he
would not go vp to Hierusalem. 13 Then
Paul answered, and sayd, What doe ye
weeping and breaking mine heart? For I
am ready not to be bound onely, but also
to die at Hierusalem for the Name of the
Lord Iesus. 14 So when he would not be
perswaded, we ceased, saying, The will
of the Lord be done. 15 And after those
dayes we trussed vp our fardels, and went
vp to Hierusalem. 16 There went with vs
also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea,
and brought with them one Mnason of
Cyprus, an olde disciple, with whome we
should lodge. 17 And when we were come
to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs
gladly. 18 And the next day Paul went in
with vs vnto Iames: and all the Elders
were there assembled. 19 And when he
had embraced them, hee tolde by order
all things, that God had wrought among
the Gentiles by his ministration. 20 So
when they heard it, they glorified God,
and sayd vnto him, Thou seest, brother,
how many thousand Iewes there are
which beleeue, and they are all zealous
of the Law: 21 Now they are informed
of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes,
which are among the Gentiles, to forsake
Moses, and sayest that they ought not to
circumcise their sonnes, neither to liue
after the customes. 22 What is then to
be done? the multitude must needes
come together: for they shall heare that
thou art come. 23 Doe therefore this
that we say to thee. We haue foure
Acts 21:34
men, which haue made a vowe, 24 Them
take, and purifie thy selfe with them,
and contribute with them, that they may
shaue their heads: and all shall knowe,
that those things, whereof they haue bene
informed concerning thee, are nothing,
but that thou thy selfe also walkest and
keepest the Lawe. 25 For as touching
ye Gentiles, which beleeue, we haue
written, and determined that they ob-
serue no such thing, but that they keepe
themselues from things offred to idoles,
and from blood, and from that that is
strangled, and from fornication. 26 Then
Paul tooke the men, and the next day was
purified with them, and entred into the
Temple, declaring the accomplishment of
the dayes of the purification, vntill that
an offering should be offered for euery
one of them. 27 And when the seuen dayes
were almost ended, the Iewes which were
of Asia (when they sawe him in the
Temple) moued all the people, and laide
hands on him, 28 Crying, Men of Israel,
helpe: this is the man that teacheth all
men euery where against the people, and
the Lawe, and this place: moreouer, he
hath brought Grecians into the Temple,
and hath polluted this holy place. 29 For
they had seene before Trophimus an
Ephesian with him in the citie, whom they
supposed that Paul had brought into the
Temple. 30 Then all the citie was moued,
and the people ran together: and they
tooke Paul and drewe him out of the
Temple, and forth with the doores were
shut. 31 But as they went about to kill him,
tydings came vnto the chiefe captaine of
the band, that all Hierusalem was on
an vproare. 32 Who immediately tooke
souldiers and Centurions, and ran downe
vnto them: and when they sawe the
chiefe Captaine and the souldiers, they
left beating of Paul. 33 Then the chiefe
Captaine came neere and tooke him, and
commanded him to be bound with two
chaines, and demaunded who he was,
and what he had done. 34 And one cryed
this, another that, among the people. So
when he could not know the certeintie for
the tumult, he commanded him to be ledActs 21:35
973
into the castell. 35 And when hee came
vnto the grieces, it was so that he was
borne of the souldiers, for the violence
of the people. 36 For the multitude of
the people followed after, crying, Away
with him. 37 And as Paul should haue
bene led into the castell, he sayd vnto the
chiefe Captaine, May I speake vnto thee?
Who sayd, Canst thou speake Greeke?
38 Art not thou the Egyptian who before
these dayes raised a sedition, and led
out into the wildernesse foure thousande
men that were murtherers? 39 Then Paul
sayde, Doubtlesse, I am a man which am a
Iewe, and citizen of Tarsus, a famous citie
of Cilicia, and I beseech thee, suffer mee
to speake vnto the people. 40 And when he
had giuen him licence, Paul stoode on the
grieces, and beckened with the hand vnto
the people: and when there was made
great silence, hee spake vnto them in the
Hebrewe tongue, saying,
22
1 Ye men, brethren and Fathers, heare
my defence nowe towards you. 2 (And
when they heard that he spake in the
Hebrewe tongue to them, they kept the
more silence, and he sayd) 3 I am verely
a man, which am a Iew, borne in Tarsus
in Cilicia, but brought vp in this citie
at the feete of Gamaliel, and instructed
according to the perfect maner of the
Lawe of the Fathers, and was zealous
toward God, as ye all are this day. 4 And
I persecuted this way vnto the death,
binding and deliuering into prison both
men and women. 5 As also ye chiefe
Priest doeth beare me witnes, and al the
company of the Elders: of whom also I
receiued letters vnto the brethren, and
went to Damascus to bring them which
were there, bound vnto Hierusalem, that
they might be punished. 6 And so it was,
as I iourneyed and was come neere vnto
Damascus about noone, that suddenly
there shone from heauen a great light
round about me. 7 So I fell vnto the earth,
and heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou mee? 8 Then
I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And
he said to me, I am Iesus of Nazareth,
Acts 22:24
whom thou persecutest. 9 Moreouer they
that were with me, sawe in deede a light
and were afraide: but they heard not the
voyce of him that spake vnto me. 10 Then
I sayd, What shall I doe, Lord? And the
Lord sayde vnto me, Arise, and goe into
Damascus: and there it shall be tolde
thee of all things, which are appointed
for thee to doe. 11 So when I could not
see for the glory of that light, I was led
by the hand of them that were with me,
and came into Damascus. 12 And one
Ananias a godly man, as perteining to the
Lawe, hauing good report of all the Iewes
which dwelt there, 13 Came vnto me, and
stoode, and sayd vnto me, Brother Saul,
receiue thy sight: and that same houre
I looked vpon him. 14 And he sayd, The
God of our fathers hath appointed thee,
that thou shouldest knowe his wil, and
shouldest see that Iust one, and shouldest
heare the voyce of his mouth. 15 For
thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men,
of the things which thou hast seene and
heard. 16 Now therefore why tariest thou?
Arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sinnes, in calling on the Name of
the Lord. 17 And it came to passe, that
when I was come againe to Hierusalem,
and prayed in the Temple, I was in a
traunce, 18 And saw him saying vnto me,
Make haste, and get thee quickly out of
Hierusalem: for they will not receiue thy
witnes concerning me. 19 Then I sayd,
Lord, they know that I prisoned, and beat
in euery Synagogue them that beleeued
in thee. 20 And when the blood of thy
martyr Steuen was shed, I also stood by,
and consented vnto his death, and kept
the clothes of them that slew him. 21 Then
he sayd vnto me, Depart: for I will send
thee farre hence vnto the Gentiles. 22 And
they heard him vnto this worde, but then
they lift vp their voyces, and sayd, Away
with such a fellow from the earth: for it
is not meete that he should liue. 23 And
as they cried and cast off their clothes,
and threw dust into the aire, 24 The chiefe
captaine commanded him to be led into
the castle, and bade that he should be
scourged, and examined, that he might
knowe wherefore they cryed so on him.Acts 22:25
974
25 And as they bound him with thongs,
Paul sayd vnto the Centurion that stood
by, Is it lawfull for you to scourge one
that is a Romane, and not condemned?
26 Nowe when the Centurion heard it,
hee went, and tolde the chiefe captaine,
saying, Take heede what thou doest: for
this man is a Romane. 27 Then the chiefe
captaine came, and sayd to him, Tel me,
art thou a Romane? And he said, Yea.
28 And the chiefe captaine answered, With
a great summe obtained I this freedome.
Then Paul sayd, But I was so borne.
29 Then straightway they departed from
him, which should haue examined him:
and the chiefe captaine also was afrayd,
after he knewe that hee was a Romane,
and that he had bound him. 30 On the next
day, because hee would haue knowen the
certaintie wherefore he was accused of
the Iewes, he loosed him from his bonds,
and commanded the hie Priests and all
their Councill to come together: and he
brought Paul, and set him before them.
23
1 And Paul behelde earnestly the Coun-
cill, and sayde, Men and brethren, I
haue in all good conscience serued God
vntill this day. 2 Then the hie Priest
Ananias commanded them that stood by,
to smite him on the mouth. 3 Then sayd
Paul to him, God will smite thee, thou
whited wall: for thou sittest to iudge me
according to the Lawe, and transgressing
the Lawe, commaundest thou me to be
smitten? 4 And they that stood by, sayd,
Reuilest thou Gods hie Priest? 5 Then sayd
Paul, I knewe not, brethren, that he was
the hie Priest: for it is written, Thou shalt
not speake euill of the ruler of thy people.
6 But when Paul perceiued that the one
part were of the Sadduces, and the other
of the Pharises, hee cried in the Council,
Men and brethren, I am a Pharise, the
sonne of a Pharise: I am accused of
the hope and resurrection of the dead.
7 And when hee had saide this, there
was a dissension betweene the Pharises
and the Sadduces, so that the multitude
was deuided. 8 For the Sadduces say that
there is no resurrection, neither Angel,
Acts 23:20
nor spirit: but the Pharises confesse both.
9 Then there was a great crye: and the
Scribes of the Pharises part rose vp, and
stroue, saying, Wee finde none euill in
this man: but if a spirit or an Angel hath
spoken to him, let vs not fight against
God. 10 And when there was a great
dissension, the chiefe captaine, fearing
lest Paul should haue bene pulled in
pieces of them, commanded the souldiers
to go downe, and take him from among
them, and to bring him into the castel.
11 Nowe the night folowing, the Lord
stoode by him, and saide, Be of good
courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified of
mee in Hierusalem, so must thou beare
witnesse also at Rome. 12 And when the
day was come, certaine of the Iewes made
an assemblie, and bounde themselues
with a curse, saying, that they woulde
neither eate nor drinke, till they had
killed Paul. 13 And they were more then
fourtie, which had made this conspiracie.
14 And they came to the chiefe Priestes
and Elders, and said, We haue bound
our selues with a solemne curse, that
wee will eate nothing, vntill we haue
slaine Paul. 15 Nowe therefore, ye and
the Council signifie to the chiefe captaine,
that hee bring him foorth vnto you to
morow: as though you would know some
thing more perfectly of him, and we,
or euer he come neere, will be readie
to kill him. 16 But when Pauls sisters
sonne heard of their laying awaite, he
went, and entred into the castel, and
tolde Paul. 17 And Paul called one of the
Centurions vnto him, and said, Take this
yong man hence vnto the chiefe captaine:
for he hath a certaine thing to shewe
him. 18 So hee tooke him, and brought
him to the chiefe captaine, and saide,
Paul the prisoner called mee vnto him,
and prayed mee to bring this yong man
vnto thee, which hath some thing to say
vnto thee. 19 Then the chiefe captaine
tooke him by the hande, and went apart
with him alone, and asked him, What
hast thou to shewe me? 20 And he saide,
The Iewes haue conspired to desire thee,
that thou wouldest bring foorth Paul toActs 23:21
975
morow into the Council, as though they
would inquire somewhat of him more
perfectly: 21 But let them not perswade
thee: for there lie in waite for him of
them, more then fourtie men, which haue
bound themselues with a curse, that they
will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue
killed him: and nowe are they readie,
and waite for thy promise. 22 The chiefe
captaine then let the yong man depart,
after hee had charged him to vtter it to
no man, that he had shewed him these
things. 23 And he called vnto him two cer-
taine Centurions, saying, Make readie two
hundred souldiers, that they may go to
Cæsarea, and horsemen three score and
ten, and two hundred with dartes, at the
thirde houre of the night. 24 And let them
make readie an horse, that Paul being set
on, may be brought safe vnto Felix the
Gouernour. 25 And he wrote an epistle
in this maner: 26 Claudius Lysias vnto
the most noble Gouernour Felix sendeth
greeting. 27 As this man was taken of
the Iewes, and shoulde haue bene killed
of them, I came vpon them with the
garison, and rescued him, perceiuing that
he was a Romane. 28 And when I would
haue knowen the cause, wherefore they
accused him, I brought him forth into
their Council. 29 There I perceiued that
hee was accused of questions of their
Lawe, but had no crime worthy of death,
or of bondes. 30 And when it was shewed
me, how that the Iewes layd waite for the
man, I sent him straightway to thee, and
commanded his accusers to speake before
thee the thinges that they had against
him. Farewell. 31 Then the souldiers
as it was commanded them, tooke Paul,
and brought him by night to Antipatris.
32 And the next day, they left the horse-
men to goe with him, and returned vnto
the Castel. 33 Now when they came to
Cæsarea, they deliuered the epistle to the
Gouernour, and presented Paul also vnto
him. 34 So when the Gouernour had read
it, hee asked of what prouince he was:
and when he vnderstoode that he was
of Cilicia, 35 I will heare thee, said he,

iudgement hall.
1 Now
24
after fiue dayes, Ananias the
hie Priest came downe with the Elders,
and with Tertullus a certaine oratour,
which appeared before the Gouernour
against Paul. 2 And when he was called
foorth, Tertullus began to accuse him, say-
ing, Seeing that we haue obtained great
quietnesse through thee, and that many
worthy things are done vnto this nation
through thy prouidence, 3 We acknowl-
edge it wholy, and in all places most noble
Felix, with all thankes, 4 But that I be not
tedious vnto thee, I pray thee, that thou
wouldest heare vs of thy courtesie a fewe
wordes. 5 Certainely we haue found this
man a pestilent fellowe, and a moouer of
sedition among all the Iewes throughout
the world, and a chiefe maintainer of the
secte of the Nazarites: 6 And hath gone
about to pollute the Temple: therefore
wee tooke him, and woulde haue iudged
him according to our Lawe: 7 But the
chiefe captaine Lysias came vpon vs, and
with great violence tooke him out of our
handes, 8 Commanding his accusers to
come to thee: of whom thou mayest (if
thou wilt inquire) know all these things
whereof we accuse him. 9 And the Iewes
likewise affirmed, saying that it was so.
10 Then Paul, after that the gouernour
had beckened vnto him that hee shoulde
speake, answered, I do the more gladly
answere for my selfe, for as much as I
knowe that thou hast bene of many yeres
a iudge vnto this nation, 11 Seeing that
thou mayest knowe, that there are but
twelue dayes since I came vp to worship
in Hierusalem. 12 And they neither found
mee in the Temple disputing with any
man, neither making vproare among the
people, neither in the Synagogues, nor
in the citie. 13 Neither can they proue
the things, whereof they now accuse me.
14 But this I confesse vnto thee, that after
the way (which they call heresie) so wor-
ship I the God of my fathers, beleeuing all
things which are written in the Lawe and
the Prophets, 15 And haue hope towardesActs 24:16
976
God, that the resurrection of the dead,
which they themselues looke for also,
shalbe both of iust and vniust. 16 And
herein I endeuour my selfe to haue alway
a cleare conscience towarde God, and
toward men. 17 Now after many yeres,
I came and brought almes to my nation
and offerings. 18 At what time, certaine
Iewes of Asia founde mee purified in
the Temple, neither with multitude, nor
with tumult. 19 Who ought to haue bene
present before thee, and accuse me, if
they had ought against me. 20 Or let these
themselues say, if they haue found any
vniust thing in mee, while I stoode in the
Council, 21 Except it be for this one voyce,
that I cried standing among them, Of the
resurrection of the dead am I accused of
you this day. 22 Nowe when Felix heard
these things, he deferred them, and said,
When I shall more perfectly know the
things which concerne this way, by the
comming of Lysias the chiefe Captaine,
I will decise your matter. 23 Then hee
commanded a Centurion to keepe Paul,
and that he should haue ease, and that
he should forbid none of his acquaintance
to minister vnto him, or to come vnto
him. 24 And after certaine dayes, came
Felix with his wife Drusilla, which was
a Iewesse, and he called foorth Paul,
and heard him of the faith in Christ.
25 And as he disputed of righteousnes
and temperance, and of the iudgement
to come, Felix trembled, and answered,
Go thy way for this time, and when I
haue conuenient time, I will call for thee.
26 Hee hoped also that money shoulde
haue bene giuen him of Paul, that he
might loose him: wherefore hee sent for
him the oftner, and communed with him.
27 When two yeeres were expired, Porcius
Festus came into Felix roume: and Felix
willing to get fauour of the Iewes, left Paul
bound.
25
1 When Festus was then come into the
prouince, after three dayes he went vp
from Caesarea vnto Hierusalem. 2 Then
the high Priest, and the chiefe of the Iewes
appeared before him against Paul: and
Acts 25:16
they besought him, 3 And desired fauour
against him, that hee would send for him
to Hierusalem: and they layd waite to kill
him by the way. 4 But Festus answered,
that Paul should bee kept at Caesarea,
and that he himselfe would shortly depart
thither. 5 Let them therefore, saide he,
which among you are able, come downe
with vs: and if there be any wickednes
in the man, let them accuse him. 6 Now
when he had taried among them no
more then ten dayes, hee went downe
to Caesarea, and the next day sate in
the iudgement seat, and commanded Paul
to be brought. 7 And when hee was
come, the Iewes which were come from
Hierusalem, stoode about him and layd
many and grieuous complaints against
Paul, whereof they could make no plaine
proofe, 8 Forasmuch as he answered, that
he had neither offended any thing against
the lawe of the Iewes, neither against
9 Yet
ye temple, nor against Caesar.
Festus willing to get fauour of the Iewes,
answered Paul and saide, Wilt thou goe
vp to Hierusalem, and there be iudged
of these things before mee? 10 Then
said Paul, I stand at Caesars iudgment
seate, where I ought to be iudged: to
the Iewes I haue done no wrong, as thou
very well knowest. 11 For if I haue done
wrong, or committed any thing worthie
of death, I refuse not to die: but if there
be none of these things whereof they
accuse me, no man, to pleasure them,
can deliuer me to them: I appeale vnto
Caesar. 12 Then when Festus had spoken
with the Council, hee answered, Hast thou
appealed vnto Caesar? vnto Caesar shalt
thou goe. 13 And after certaine dayes,
King Agrippa and Bernice came downe
14 And
to Caesarea to salute Festus.
when they had remained there many
dayes, Festus declared Pauls cause vnto
the King, saying, There is a certaine man
left in prison by Felix, 15 Of whom when
I came to Hierusalem, the high Priestes
and Elders of the Iewes informed me,
and desired to haue iudgement against
him. 16 To whome I answered, that it
is not the maner of the Romanes forActs 25:17
977
fauour to deliuer any man to the death,
before that hee which is accused, haue
the accusers before him, and haue place
to defend himselfe, concerning the crime.
17 Therefore when they were come hither,
without delay the day following I sate
on the iudgement seate, and commanded
the man to be brought foorth. 18 Against
whom when the accusers stood vp, they
brought no crime of such things as I
supposed: 19 But had certaine questions
against him of their owne superstition,
and of one Iesus which was dead, whom
Paul affirmed to be aliue. 20 And because
I doubted of such maner of question,
I asked him whether he would goe to
Hierusalem, and there be iudged of these
things. 21 But because he appealed to be
reserued to the examination of Augustus,
I commanded him to be kept, till I mght
send him to Cesar. 22 Then Agrippa sayd
vnto Festus, I would also heare the man
my selfe. To morowe, sayd he, thou
shalt heare him. 23 And on the morowe
when Agrippa was come and Bernice with
great pompe, and were entred into the
Common hall with the chiefe captaines
and chiefe men of the citie, at Festus
commandement Paul was brought forth.
24 And Festus sayd, King Agrippa, and all
men which are present with vs, ye see
this man, about whom all the multitude
of the Iewes haue called vpon me, both
at Hierusalem, and here, crying, that he
ought not to liue any longer. 25 Yet haue
I found nothing worthy of death, that
he hath committed: neuertheles, seeing
that he hath appealed to Augustus, I haue
determined to send him. 26 Of whome
I haue no certaine thing to write vnto
my Lord: wherefore I haue brought him
forth vnto you, and specially vnto thee,
King Agrippa, that after examination had,
I might haue somewhat to write. 27 For
me thinketh it vnreasonable to send a
prisoner, and not to shewe the causes
which are layde against him.
Acts 26:16
stretched forth the hand, and answered
for himselfe. 2 I thinke my selfe happy,
King Agrippa, because I shall answere this
day before thee of all the things whereof
I am accused of the Iewes. 3 Chiefly,
because thou hast knowledge of all cus-
tomes, and questions which are among
the Iewes: wherefore I beseech thee, to
heare me patiently. 4 As touching my
life from my childhood, and what it was
from the beginning among mine owne
nation at Hierusalem, know all the Iewes,
5 Which knewe me heretofore, euen from
my elders (if they would testifie) that after
the most straite sect of our religion I liued
a Pharise. 6 And now I stand and am
accused for the hope of the promise made
of God vnto our fathers. 7 Whereunto
our twelue tribes instantly seruing God
day and night, hope to come: for the
which hopes sake, O King Agrippa, I am
accused of the Iewes. 8 Why should it
be thought a thing incredible vnto you,
that God should raise againe the dead?
9 I also verely thought in my selfe, that
I ought to doe many contrarie things
against the Name of Iesus of Nazareth.
10 Which thing I also did in Hierusalem:
for many of the Saints I shut vp in prison,
hauing receiued authoritie of the hie
Priests, and when they were put to death,
I gaue my sentence. 11 And I punished
them throughout all the Synagogues, and
compelled them to blaspheme, and being
more mad against them, I persecuted
them, euen vnto strange cities. 12 At
which time, euen as I went to Damascus
with authoritie, and commission from the
hie Priests, 13 At midday, O King, I sawe
in the way a light from heauen, passing
the brightnes of the sunne, shine round
about mee, and them which went with
me. 14 So when we were all fallen to the
earth, I heard a voyce speaking vnto me,
and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard
for thee to kicke against pricks. 15 Then
I sayd, Who art thou, Lord? And he
sayd, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest.
26
16 But rise and stand vp on thy feete:
1 Then Agrippa sayd vnto Paul, Thou art
for I haue appeared vnto thee for this
permitted to speake for thy selfe. So PaulActs 26:17
978
purpose, to appoint thee a minister and
a witnesse, both of the things which thou
hast seene, and of the things in the which
I will appeare vnto thee, 17 Deliuering
thee from this people, and from the
Gentiles, vnto whom now I send thee,
18 To open their eyes, that they may
turne from darknes to light, and from
the power of Satan vnto God, that they
may receiue forgiuenes of sinnes, and
inheritance among them, which are sanc-
tified by fayth in me. 19 Wherefore, King
Agrippa, I was not disobedient vnto the
heauenly vision, 20 But shewed first vnto
them of Damascus, and at Hierusalem,
and throughout all the coasts of Iudea,
and then to the Gentiles, that they should
repent and turne to God, and doe workes
worthy amendment of life. 21 For this
cause the Iewes caught me in the Temple,
and went about to kill me. 22 Neuertheles,
I obteined helpe of God, and continue
vnto this day, witnessing both to small
and to great, saying none other things,
then those which the Prophets and Moses
did say should come, 23 To wit, that Christ
should suffer, and that he should be
the first that should rise from the dead,
and should shew light vnto this people,
and to the Gentiles. 24 And as he thus
answered for himselfe, Festus said with
a loude voyce, Paul, thou art besides thy
selfe: much learning doeth make thee
mad. 25 But he said, I am not mad, O
noble Festus, but I speake the wordes
of trueth and sobernes. 26 For the King
knoweth of these things, before whom
also I speake boldly: for I am perswaded
that none of these things are hidden from
him: for this thing was not done in a
27 O King Agrippa, beleeuest
corner.
thou the Prophets? I know that thou
beleeuest. 28 Then Agrippa said vnto Paul,
Almost thou perswadest me to become
a Christian. 29 Then Paul sayd, I would
to God that not onely thou, but also all
that heare me to day, were both almost,
and altogether such as I am, except these
bonds. 30 And when he had thus spoken,
the King rose vp, and the gouernour, and
Bernice, and they that sate with them.
Acts 27:12
31 And when they were gone apart, they
talked betweene themselues, saying, This
man doeth nothing worthy of death, nor
of bonds. 32 Then sayd Agrippa vnto
Festus, This man might haue bene loosed,
if hee had not appealed vnto Cesar.
27
1 Now when it was concluded, that we
should sayle into Italie, they deliuered
both Paul, and certaine other prisoners
vnto a Centurion named Iulius, of the
band of Augustus. 2 And we entred into a
ship of Adramyttium purposing to saile by
the coastes of Asia, and launched foorth,
and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a
Thessalonian, with vs. 3 And the next
day we arriued at Sidon: and Iulius
courteously entreated Paul, and gaue him
libertie to go vnto his friends, that they
might refresh him. 4 And from thence
we launched, and sayled hard by Cyprus,
because ye windes were contrarie. 5 Then
sayled we ouer the sea by Cilicia, and
Pamphilia, and came to Myra, a citie in
Lycia. 6 And there the Centurion found
a ship of Alexandria, sayling into Italie,
and put vs therein. 7 And when we had
sayled slowly many dayes, and scarce
were come against Gnidum, because the
winde suffered vs not, we sailed hard
by Candie, neere to Salmone, 8 And with
much adoe sayled beyond it, and came
vnto a certaine place called the Faire
hauens, neere vnto the which was the
citie Lasea. 9 So when much time was
spent, and sayling was now ieopardous,
because also the Fast was nowe passed,
Paul exhorted them, 10 And sayde vnto
them, Syrs, I see that this voiage will
be with hurt and much damage, not of
the lading and ship onely, but also of
our liues. 11 Neuertheles the Centurion
beleeued rather the gouernour and the
master of the ship, then those things
12 And
which were spoken of Paul.
because the hauen was not commodious
to winter in, many tooke counsell to
depart thence, if by any meanes they
might attaine to Phenice, there to winter,
which is an hauen of Candie, and lyethActs 27:13
979
toward the Southwest and by West, and
Northwest and by West. 13 And when
the Southerne winde blew softly, they
supposing to atteine their purpose, loosed
neerer, and sailed by Candie. 14 But
anon after, there arose by it a stormy
winde called Euroclydon. 15 And when
the ship was caught, and could not resist
the winde, we let her goe, and were caried
away. 16 And we ran vnder a litle Yle
named Clauda, and had much a doe to get
the boat. 17 Which they tooke vp and vsed
all helpe, vndergirding the ship, fearing
least they should haue fallen into Syrtes,
and they strake saile, and so were caried.
18 The next day when we were tossed with
an exceeding tempest, they lightened the
ship. 19 And the third day we cast out with
our owne hands the tackling of the ship.
20 And when neither sunne nor starres
in many dayes appeared, and no small
tempest lay vpon vs, all hope that we
should be saued, was then taken away.
21 But after long abstinece, Paul stood
forth in the mids of them, and said, Syrs,
ye should haue hearkened to me, and not
haue loosed from Candie: so should ye
haue gained this hurt and losse. 22 But
now I exhort you to be of good courage:
for there shalbe no losse of any mans
life among you, saue of the ship onely.
23 For there stood by me this night the
Angel of God, whose I am, and whome
I serue, 24 Saying, Feare not, Paul: for
thou must be brought before Cesar: and
lo, God hath giuen vnto thee freely all
that sayle with thee. 25 Wherefore, sirs,
be of good courage: for I beleeue God,
that it shall be so as it hath bene tolde
me. 26 Howbeit, we must be cast into a
certaine Iland. 27 And when ye fourteenth
night was come, as we were caried to
and from in the Adriaticall sea about
midnight, the shipmen deemed that some
countrey approched vnto them, 28 And
sounded, and found it twentie fathoms:
and when they had gone a litle further,
they sounded againe, and found fifteene
fathoms. 29 Then fearing least they should
haue fallen into some rough places, they
cast foure ancres out of the sterne, and
Acts 27:44
wished that the day were come. 30 Nowe
as the mariners were about to flee out
of the ship, and had let downe the boat
into the sea vnder a colour as though
they would haue cast ankers out of the
foreship, 31 Paul sayde vnto the Centurion
and the souldiers, Except these abide in
the ship, ye can not be safe. 32 Then the
souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and
let it fall away. 33 And when it began to be
day, Paul exhorted them all to take meate,
saying, This is the fourteenth day that
ye haue taried, and continued fasting,
receiuing nothing: 34 Wherefore I exhort
you to take meate: for this is for your
safegarde: for there shall not an heare fall
from the head of any of you. 35 And when
he had thus spoken, hee tooke bread
and gaue thankes to God, in presence of
them all, and brake it, and began to eate.
36 Then were they all of good courage,
and they also tooke meate. 37 Nowe we
were in the ship in all two hundreth three
score and sixteene soules. 38 And whe
they had eaten ynough, they lightened the
ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
39 And when it was day, they knewe not
the countrey, but they spied a certaine
creeke with a banke, into the which they
were minded (if it were possible) to thrust
in the ship. 40 So when they had taken vp
the ankers, they committed the ship vnto
the sea, and loosed the rudder bonds, and
hoised vp the maine saile to the winde,
and drewe to the shore. 41 And when they
fell into a place, where two seas met, they
thrust in the ship: and the forepart stucke
fast, and could not be moued, but the
hinderpart was broken with the violence

counsell was to kill the prisoners, least
any of them, when he had swomme out,
should flee away. 43 But the Centurion
willing to saue Paul, stayed them from
this counsell, and commanded that they
that coulde swimme, shoulde cast them
selues first into the sea, and goe out to
land: 44 And the other, some on boardes,
and some on certaine pieces of the ship:
and so it came to passe that they came all
safe to land.Acts 28:1
980
28
1 And when they were come safe, then
they knewe that the Yle was called Melita.
2 And the Barbarians shewed vs no litle
kindnesse: for they kindled a fire, and
receiued vs euery one, because of the
present showre, and because of the colde.
3 And when Paul had gathered a nomber
of stickes, and laid them on the fire,
there came a viper out of the heate, and
leapt on his hand. 4 Nowe when ye
Barbarians saw the worme hang on his
hand, they said among themselues, This
man surely is a murtherer, whom, though
he hath escaped the sea, yet Vengeance
hath not suffered to liue. 5 But he shooke
off the worme into the fire, and felt no
harme. 6 Howbeit they wayted whe he
should haue swolne, or fallen downe dead
suddenly: but after they had looked a
great while, and sawe no inconuenience
come to him, they changed their mindes,
and said, That he was a God. 7 In the same
quarters, the chiefe man of the Yle (whose
name was Publius) had possessions: the
same receiued vs, and lodged vs three
dayes courteously. 8 And so it was, that
the father of Publius lay sicke of the
feauer, and of a bloodie flixe: to whom
Paul entred in, and when he prayed, he
laide his hands on him, and healed him.
9 When this then was done, other also
in the Yle, which had diseases, came to
him, and were healed, 10 Which also did
vs great honour: and when we departed,
they laded vs with things necessarie.
11 Nowe after three moneths we departed
in a shippe of Alexandria, which had win-
tred in the Yle, whose badge was Castor
and Pollux. 12 And when we arriued at
Syracuse, we taried there three dayes.
13 And from thence we set a compasse,
and came to Rhegium: and after one day,
the South wind blewe, and we came the
seconde day to Putioli: 14 Where we found
brethren, and were desired to tary with
them seuen dayes, and so we went toward
Rome. 15 And from thence, when the
brethren heard of vs, they came to meete
vs at the Market of Appius, and at the
Three tauernes, whom when Paul sawe,
he thanked God, and waxed bolde. 16 So
Acts 28:27
when we came to Rome, the Centurion
deliuered the prisoners to the generall
Captaine: but Paul was suffered to dwell
by him selfe with a souldier that kept
him. 17 And the third day after, Paul
called the chiefe of the Iewes together:
and when they were come, he said vnto
them, Men and brethren, though I haue
committed nothing against the people, or
Lawes of the fathers, yet was I deliuered
prisoner from Hierusalem into the han-
des of the Romanes. 18 Who when they
had examined me, would haue let me
goe, because there was no cause of death
in me. 19 But when the Iewes spake
contrary, I was constrained to appeale
vnto Cesar, not because I had ought to
accuse my nation of. 20 For this cause
therefore haue I called for you, to see
you, and to speake with you: for that
hope of Israels sake, I am bound with
this chaine. 21 Then they saide vnto him,
We neither receiued letters out of Iudea
concerning thee, neither came any of the
brethren that shewed or spake any euill
of thee. 22 But we will heare of thee what
thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect,
we knowe that euery where it is spoken
against. 23 And when they had appointed
him a day, there came many vnto him
into his lodging, to whom he expounded
testifying the kingdome of God, and per-
suading them those things that concerne
Iesus, both out of the Lawe of Moses,
and out of the Prophets, from morning
to night. 24 And some were persuaded
with ye things which were spoken, and
some beleeued not. 25 Therefore when
they agreed not among themselues, they
departed, after that Paul had spoken one
word, to wit, Well spake the holy Ghost
by Esaias the Prophet vnto our fathers,
26 Saying, Goe vnto this people, and say,
By hearing ye shall heare, and shall not
vnderstand, and seeing ye shall see, and
not perceiue. 27 For the heart of this
people is waxed fatte, and their eares
are dull of hearing, and with their eyes
haue they winked, least they shoulde see
with their eyes, and heare with their
eares, and vnderstand with their heartes,Acts 28:28
981
and should returne that I might heale
them. 28 Be it knowen therefore vnto you,
that this saluation of God is sent to the
Gentiles, and they shall heare it. 29 And
when he had saide these things, the Iewes
departed, and had great reasoning among
themselues. 30 And Paul remained two
yeeres full in an house hired for himselfe,
and receiued all that came in vnto him,
31 Preaching the kingdome of God, and
teaching those things which concerne the
Lord Iesus Christ, with all boldnesse of
speache, without let.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
THE APOSTLE TO THE
ROMANS
1 Paul a seruant of Iesus Christ called
to be an Apostle, put apart to preache the
Gospel of God, 2 (Which he had promised
afore by his Prophetes in the holy Scrip-
tures) 3 Concerning his Sonne Iesus Christ
our Lord (which was made of the seede
of Dauid according to the flesh, 4 And
declared mightily to be the Sonne of God,
touching the Spirit of sanctification by the
resurrection from the dead) 5 By whom
we haue receiued grace and Apostleship
(that obedience might be giuen vnto ye
faith) for his Name among al ye Gentiles,
6 Among whom ye be also the called of
Iesus Christ: 7 To all you that be at Rome
beloued of God, called to be Saints: Grace
be with you, and peace from God our
Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.
8 First I thanke my God through Iesus
Christ for you all, because your faith is
published throughout the whole world.
9 For God is my witnesse (whom I serue
in my spirit in the Gospel of his Sonne)
that without ceasing I make mention of
you 10 Alwayes in my prayers, beseeching
that by some meanes, one time or other I
might haue a prosperous iourney by the
will of God, to come vnto you. 11 For
I long to see you, that I might bestowe
among you some spirituall gift, that you
might be strengthened: 12 That is, that
I might be comforted together with you,
through our mutuall faith, both yours and
mine. 13 Now my brethren, I would that
ye should not be ignorant, how that I
haue oftentimes purposed to come vnto
you (but haue bene let hitherto) that I
might haue some fruite also among you,
as I haue among the other Gentiles. 14 I
am detter both to the Grecians, and to
the Barbarians, both to the wise men and
vnto the vnwise. 15 Therefore, as much as
in me is, I am readie to preach ye Gospel
to you also that are at Rome. 16 For I
am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ:
Romans 1:29
for it is the power of God vnto saluation
to euery one that beleeueth, to the Iewe
first, and also to the Grecian. 17 For by
it the righteousnesse of God is reueiled
from faith to faith: as it is written, The
iust shall liue by faith. 18 For the wrath
of God is reueiled from heauen against
all vngodlinesse, and vnrighteousnesse
of men, which withhold the trueth in
vnrighteousnesse. 19 Forasmuch as that,
which may be knowe of God, is manifest
in them: for God hath shewed it vnto
them. 20 For the inuisible things of him,
that is, his eternal power and Godhead,
are seene by ye creation of the worlde,
being considered in his workes, to the
intent that they should be without excuse:
21 Because that when they knewe God,
they glorified him not as God, neither
were thankefull, but became vaine in
their thoughtes, and their foolish heart
was full of darkenesse. 22 When they
professed themselues to be wise, they be-
came fooles. 23 For they turned the glorie
of the incorruptible God to the similitude
of the image of a corruptible man, and
of birdes, and foure footed beastes, and
of creeping things. 24 Wherefore also
God gaue them vp to their hearts lusts,
vnto vncleannesse, to defile their owne

their women did change the naturall vse
into that which is against nature. 27 And
likewise also the men left the naturall
vse of the woman, and burned in their
lust one toward another, and man with
man wrought filthinesse, and receiued
in themselues such recompence of their
errour, as was meete. 28 For as they
regarded not to acknowledge God, euen
so God deliuered them vp vnto a repro-

are not conuenient, 29 Being full of all vn-

sinned without the Lawe, shall perish also
without the Lawe: and as many as haue

Romans 2:29
sinned in the Lawe, shall be iudged by the
Lawe, 13 (For the hearers of the Lawe are
not righteous before God: but the doers
of the Lawe shalbe iustified. 14 For when
the Gentiles which haue not the Lawe,

excusing,) 16 At the day when God shall

art called a Iewe, and restest in the Lawe,
and gloriest in God, 18 And knowest his
will, and triest the things that dissent

Lawe: 19 And persuadest thy selfe that
thou art a guide of the blinde, a light
of them which are in darkenesse, 20 An
instructer of them which lacke discretion,
a teacher of the vnlearned, which hast

circucision verely is profitable, if thou
do the Lawe: but if thou be a trans-

not vncircumcision which is by nature

commeth the knowledge of sinne. 21 But onely, or vpon the vncircumcision also?Romans 4:10
985
For we say, that faith was imputed vnto
Abraham for righteousnesse. 10 Howe
was it then imputed?
when he was
circumcised, or vncircumcised? not when
he was cricumcised, but when he was
vncircumcised. 11 After, he receiued the
signe of circumcision, as the seale of
the righteousnesse of ye faith which he
had, when he was vncircumcised, that
he should be the father of all them
that beleeue, not being circumcised, that
righteousnesse might be imputed to them
also, 12 And the father of circumcision,
not vnto them onely which are of the
circumcision, but vnto them also that
walke in the steppes of the faith of our
father Abraham, which he had when he
was vncircumcised. 13 For the promise
that he should be the heire of the worlde,
was not giuen to Abraham, or to his
seede, through the Lawe, but through the
righteousnesse of faith. 14 For if they
which are of the Lawe, be heires, faith
is made voide, and the promise is made
of none effect. 15 For the Lawe causeth
wrath: for where no Lawe is, there is
no transgression. 16 Therefore it is by
faith, that it might come by grace, and the
promise might be sure to all the seede,
not to that onely which is of the Lawe:
but also to that which is of the faith of
Abraham, who is the father of vs all,
17 (As it is written, I haue made thee
a father of many nations) euen before
God whom he beleeued, who quickeneth
the dead, and calleth those thinges which
be not, as though they were. 18 Which
Abraham aboue hope, beleeued vnder
hope, that he should be the father of
many nations: according to that which
was spoken to him, So shall thy seede be.
19 And he not weake in the faith, con-
sidered not his owne bodie, which was
nowe dead, being almost an hundreth
yeere olde, neither the deadnes of Saraes
wombe. 20 Neither did he doubt of the
promise of God through vnbeliefe, but
was strengthened in the faith, and gaue
glorie to God, 21 Being fully assured that
he which had promised, was also able to
doe it. 22 And therefore it was imputed
to him for righteousnesse. 23 Nowe it is
Romans 5:15
not written for him onely, that it was
imputed to him for righteousnesse, 24 But
also for vs, to whom it shalbe imputed
for righteousnesse, which beleeue in him
that raised vp Iesus our Lord from the
dead, 25 Who was deliuered to death for
our sinnes, and is risen againe for our
iustification.
5
1 Then being iustified by faith, we haue
peace toward God through our Lord Iesus
Christ. 2 By who also through faith, we
haue had this accesse into this grace,
wherein we stand, and reioyce vnder ye
hope of the glory of God. 3 Neither that
onely, but also we reioyce in tribulations,
knowing that tribulation bringeth forth
patience, 4 And patience experience, and
experience hope, 5 And hope maketh not
ashamed, because the loue of God is shed
abroade in our heartes by the holy Ghost,
which is giuen vnto vs. 6 For Christ,
when we were yet of no strength, at his
time died for the vngodly. 7 Doutles one
will scarce die for a righteous man: but
yet for a good man it may be that one
dare die. 8 But God setteth out his loue
towards vs, seeing that while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for vs. 9 Much more
then, being now iustified by his blood, we
shalbe saued from wrath through him.
10 For if when we were enemies, we
were reconciled to God by the death of
his Sonne, much more being reconciled,
we shalbe saued by his life, 11 And not
onely so, but we also reioyce in God
through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom
we haue nowe receiued the atonement.
12 Wherefore, as by one man sinne entred
into ye world, and death by sinne, and so
death went ouer all men: in who all men
haue sinned. 13 For vnto the time of the
Law was sinne in the worlde, but sinne is
not imputed, while there is no lawe. 14 But
death reigned from Adam to Moses, euen
ouer them also that sinned not after the
like maner of that transgression of Adam,
which was the figure of him that was to
come. 15 But yet the gift is not so, as is
the offence: for if through the offence of
that one, many be dead, much more theRomans 5:16
986
grace of God, and the gift by grace, which
is by one man Iesus Christ, hath abounded
vnto many. 16 Neither is the gift so, as
that which entred in by one that sinned:
for the fault came of one offence vnto
condemnation: but the gift is of many
offences to iustification. 17 For if by the of-
fence of one, death reigned through one,
much more shall they which receiue that
abundance of grace, and of that gift of
that righteousnesse, reigne in life through
one, that is, Iesus Christ. 18 Likewise then
as by the offence of one, the fault came
on all men to condemnation, so by the
iustifying of one, the benefite abounded
toward all men to the iustification of
life. 19 For as by one mans disobedience
many were made sinners, so by that
obedience of that one shall many also
20 Moreouer the
be made righteous.
Law entred thereupon that the offence
shoulde abound: neuerthelesse, where
sinne abounded, there grace abounded
much more: 21 That as sinne had reigned
vnto death, so might grace also reigne by
righteousnesse vnto eternall life, through
Iesus Christ our Lord.
1 What
6
Romans 7:2
dominion ouer him. 10 For in that hee
died, hee died once to sinne but in that
he liueth, he liueth to God. 11 Likewise
thinke ye also, that ye are dead to sin,
but are aliue to God in Iesus Christ our
Lord. 12 Let not sinne reigne therefore in
your mortal body, that ye should obey it
in ye lusts therof: 13 Neither giue ye your
members, as weapons of vnrighteousnes
vnto sinne: but giue your selues vnto
God, as they that are aliue from the dead,
and giue your members as weapons of
righteousnesse vnto God. 14 For sinne
shall not haue dominion ouer you: for
ye are not vnder ye Lawe, but vnder
grace. 15 What then? shall we sinne,
because we are not vnder the Law, but
vnder grace? God forbid. 16 Knowe ye
not, that to whomsoeuer yee giue your
selues as seruats to obey, his seruants ye
are to whom ye obey, whether it be of
sinne vnto death, or of obedience vnto
righteousnesse? 17 But God be thanked,
that ye haue beene the seruants of sinne,
but yee haue obeyed from the heart vnto
the forme of the doctrine, wherunto ye
were deliuered. 18 Being then made free
from sinne, yee are made the seruants
of righteousnesse. 19 I speake after the
maner of man, because of the infirmitie
of your flesh: for as yee haue giuen
your members seruants to vncleannes
and to iniquitie, to commit iniquitie, so
now giue your mebers seruants vnto
righteousnesse in holinesse. 20 For when
ye were the seruants of sinne, ye were
freed from righteousnesse. 21 What fruit
had ye then in those things, whereof ye
are nowe ashamed? For the ende of those
things is death. 22 But now being freed
from sinne, and made seruants vnto God,
ye haue your fruit in holines, and the end,
euerlasting life. 23 For the wages of sinne
is death: but the gift of God is eternall life,
through Iesus Christ our Lord.
shall we say then? Shall we
continue still in sinne, that grace may
abounde? God forbid. 2 Howe shall we,
that are dead to sinne, liue yet therein?
3 Knowe ye not, that all we which haue
bene baptized into Iesus Christ, haue
bene baptized into his death? 4 We are
buried then with him by baptisme into his
death, that like as Christ was raysed vp
from the dead to the glorie of the Father,
so we also should walke in newnesse of
life. 5 For if we be planted with him to
the similitude of his death, euen so shall
we be to the similitude of his resurrection,
6 Knowing this, that our old man is
crucified with him, that the body of sinne
might be destroied, that henceforth we
should not serue sinne. 7 For he that is
7
dead, is freed from sinne. 8 Wherefore, if
1 Knowe yee not, brethren, (for I speake
we bee dead with Christ, we beleeue that
we shall liue also with him, 9 Knowing to them that knowe the Lawe) that the
that Christ being raised from the dead, Lawe hath dominion ouer a man as long
dieth no more: death hath no more as he liueth? 2 For the woman which isRomans 7:3
987
in subiection to a man, is bound by the
Lawe to the man, while he liueth: but if
the man bee dead, shee is deliuered from
the lawe of the man. 3 So then, if while
the man liueth, she taketh another man,
she shalbe called an adulteresse: but if
the man be dead, she is free from the
Law, so that shee is not an adulteresse,
though shee take another man. 4 So yee,
my brethren, are dead also to the Law by
ye body of Christ, that ye should be vnto
an other, euen vnto him that is raised
vp from the dead, that we should bring
foorth fruite vnto God. 5 For when we
were in ye flesh, the affections of sinnes,
which were by the Law, had force in our
members, to bring foorth fruit vnto death.
6 But now we are deliuered from the
Lawe, he being dead in whom we were
holden, that we should serue in newnesse
of Spirite, and not in the oldnesse of the
letter. 7 What shall we say then? Is the
Lawe sinne? God forbid. Nay, I knewe
not sinne, but by the Lawe: for I had
not knowen lust, except the Lawe had
sayd, Thou shalt not lust. 8 But sinne
tooke an occasion by ye commandement,
and wrought in me all maner of concu-
piscence: for without the Lawe sinne is
dead. 9 For I once was aliue, without
the Law: but when the commandement
came, sinne reuiued, 10 But I died: and
the same commandement which was or-
deined vnto life, was found to be vnto me
vnto death. 11 For sinne tooke occasion
by the commandement, and deceiued me,
and thereby slewe me. 12 Wherefore the
Lawe is holy, and that commandement
13 Was
is holy, and iust, and good.
that then which is good, made death
vnto me? God forbid: but sinne, that
it might appeare sinne, wrought death
in me by that which is good, that sinne
might be out of measure sinfull by the
commandement. 14 For we knowe that
the Law is spirituall, but I am carnall,
solde vnder sinne. 15 For I alow not that
which I do: for what I would, that do I
not: but what I hate, that do I. 16 If I doe
then that which I woulde not, I consent to
the Lawe, that it is good. 17 Nowe then, it
is no more I, that doe it, but sinne that
dwelleth in me. 18 For I know, that in
Romans 8:10
me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good
thing: for to wil is preset with me: but
I find no meanes to perform that which
is good. 19 For I doe not the good thing,
which I would, but the euil, which I would
not, that do I. 20 Nowe if I do that I would
not, it is no more I that doe it, but the
sinne that dwelleth in me. 21 I finde then
that when I would doe good, I am thus
yoked, that euill is present with me. 22 For
I delite in the Law of God, concerning the
inner man: 23 But I see another Law in
my members, rebelling against the Lawe
of my minde, and leading me captiue
vnto the lawe of sinne, which is in my
members. 24 O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliuer me from the body of
this death! 25 I thanke God through Iesus
Christ our Lord. Then I my selfe in my
minde serue the Lawe of God, but in my
flesh the lawe of sinne.
8
1 Now then there is no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Iesus, which walke
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
2 For the Lawe of the Spirite of life, which
is in Christ Iesus, hath freed mee from the
lawe of sinne and of death. 3 For (that that
was impossible to ye Lawe, in as much
as it was weake, because of ye flesh) God
sending his owne Sonne, in ye similitude
of sinful flesh, and for sinne, condened
sinne in the flesh, 4 That that righteousnes
of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, which
walke not after ye flesh, but after the
Spirit. 5 For they that are after the flesh,
sauour the things of the flesh: but they
that are after the Spirit, the things of the
Spirit. 6 For the wisedome of the flesh is
death: but the wisedome of the Spirit is
life and peace, 7 Because the wisedome of
the flesh is enimitie against God: for it is
not subiect to the Lawe of God, neither
in deede can be. 8 So then they that are
in the flesh, can not please God. 9 Now
ye are not in the flesh, but in ye Spirit,
because ye spirit of God dwelleth in you:
but if any man hath not ye Spirit of Christ,
ye same is not his. 10 And if Christ bee in
you, the body is dead, because of sinne:Romans 8:11
but the Spirite is life for righteousnesse
sake. 11 But if the Spirit of him that raised
vp Iesus from the dead, dwell in you, he
that raised vp Christ from the dead, shall
also quicken your mortall bodies, by his
Spirit that dwelleth in you. 12 Therefore
brethren, wee are detters not to the flesh,
to liue after the flesh: 13 For if ye liue
after the flesh, ye shall die: but if yee
mortifie the deedes of the body by the
Spirit, ye shall liue. 14 For as many as
are ledde by the Spirit of God, they are
the sonnes of God. 15 For ye haue not
receiued the Spirit of bodage, to feare
againe: but ye haue receiued the Spirit of
adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.
16 The same Spirit beareth witnesse with
our spirit, that we are the children of
God. 17 If we be children, we are also
heires, euen the heires of God, and heires
annexed with Christ: if so be that we
suffer with him, that we may also be
glorified with him. 18 For I count that
the afflictions of this present time are not
worthy of the glory, which shalbe shewed
vnto vs. 19 For the feruent desire of the
creature waiteth when the sonnes of God
shalbe reueiled, 20 Because the creature
is subiect to vanitie, not of it owne will,
but by reason of him, which hath subdued
it vnder hope, 21 Because the creature
also shall be deliuered from the bondage
of corruption into the glorious libertie
of the sonnes of God. 22 For we knowe
that euery creature groneth with vs also,
and trauaileth in paine together vnto this
present. 23 And not onely the creature,
but we also which haue the first fruites
of the Spirit, euen we doe sigh in our
selues, waiting for the adoption, euen the
redemption of our body. 24 For we are
saued by hope: but hope that is seene, is
not hope: for how can a man hope for
that which he seeth? 25 But if we hope
for that we see not, we doe with patience
abide for it. 26 Likewise the Spirit also
helpeth our infirmities: for we knowe
not what to pray as wee ought: but the
Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with
sighs, which cannot be expressed. 27 But
he that searcheth the heartes, knoweth
988
Romans 9:4
what is the meaning of the Spirit: for he
maketh request for ye Saints, according to
the wil of God. 28 Also we knowe that all
thinges worke together for the best vnto
them that loue God, euen to them that are
called of his purpose. 29 For those which
hee knewe before, he also predestinate to
bee made like to the image of his Sonne,
that hee might be the first borne among
many brethren. 30 Moreouer whom he
predestinate, them also he called, and
whom he called, them also he iustified,
and whom he iustified, them he also glo-
rified. 31 What shall we then say to these
thinges? If God be on our side, who can
be against vs? 32 Who spared not his owne
Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death,
how shall he not with him giue vs all
things also? 33 Who shall lay any thing to
the charge of Gods chosen? it is God that
iustifieth, 34 Who shall condemne? it is
Christ which is dead, yea, or rather, which
is risen againe, who is also at the right
hand of God, and maketh request also for
vs. 35 Who shall separate vs from the loue
of Christ? shall tribulation or anguish, or
persecution, or famine, or nakednesse, or
perill, or sworde? 36 As it is written, For
thy sake are we killed all day long: we
are counted as sheepe for the slaughter.
37 Neuerthelesse, in all these thinges we
are more then coquerours through him
that loued vs. 38 For I am perswaded
that neither death, nor life, nor Angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature shalbe
able to separate vs from the loue of God,
which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.
9
1 I say the trueth in Christ,
I lye not,
my conscience bearing mee witnes in the
holy Ghost, 2 That I haue great heauinesse,
and continuall sorow in mine heart. 3 For
I woulde wish my selfe to be separate
from Christ, for my brethren that are my
kinsemen according to the flesh, 4 Which
are the Israelites, to whome perteineth
the adoption, and the glory, and the
Couenants, and the giuing of the Lawe,Romans 9:5
989
and the seruice of God, and the promises.
5 Of whome are the fathers, and of whome
concerning the flesh, Christ came, who
is God ouer all, blessed for euer, Amen.
6 Notwithstanding it can not bee that the
worde of God should take none effect:
for all they are not Israel, which are of
Israel: 7 Neither are they all children,
because they are the seede of Abraham:
but, In Isaac shall thy seede be called:
8 That is, they which are the children of
the flesh, are not the children of God: but
the children of the promise, are counted
for the seede. 9 For this is a worde of
promise, In this same time wil I come,
and Sara shall haue a sonne. 10 Neither
he onely felt this, but also Rebecca when
shee had conceiued by one, euen by our
father Isaac. 11 For yer the children were
borne, and when they had neither done
good, nor euill (that the purpose of God
might remaine according to election, not
by workes, but by him that calleth) 12 It
was said vnto her, The elder shall serue
the yonger. 13 As it is written, I haue loued
Iacob, and haue hated Esau. 14 What shall
wee say then? Is there vnrighteousnes
with God? God forbid. 15 For he saith
to Moses, I wil haue mercy on him, to
whom I wil shew mercie: and wil haue
compassion on him, on who I wil haue
copassion. 16 So then it is not in him
that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but
in God that sheweth mercy. 17 For the
Scripture saith vnto Pharao, For this same
purpose haue I stirred thee vp, that I
might shewe my power in thee, and that
my Name might be declared throughout
al the earth. 18 Therefore he hath mercie
on whome he will, and whom he will, he
hardeneth. 19 Thou wilt say then vnto
me, Why doeth he yet complaine? for
who hath resisted his will? 20 But, O man,
who art thou which pleadest against God?
shall the thing formed say to him that
formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
21 Hath not the potter power of the clay
to make of the same lumpe one vessell
to honour, and another vnto dishonour?
22 What and if God would, to shewe his
wrath, and to make his power knowen,
suffer with long patience the vessels of
Romans 10:5
wrath, prepared to destruction? 23 And
that hee might declare the riches of his
glory vpon the vessels of mercy, which
hee hath prepared vnto glory? 24 Euen
vs whome hee hath called, not of of the
Iewes onely, but also of the Gentiles, 25 As
he sayth also in Osee, I will call them,
My people, which were not my people:
and her, Beloued, which was not beloued.
26 And it shalbe in the place where it was
said vnto them, Ye are not my people,
that there they shalbe called, The children
of the liuing God. 27 Also Esaias cryeth
concerning Israel, Though the number of
the children of Israel were as the sand of
the sea, yet shall but a remnant be saued.
28 For he wil make his account, and gather
it into a short summe with righteousnes:
for the Lord will make a short count in
the earth. 29 And as Esaias sayde before,
Except the Lord of hostes had left vs a
seede, we had bene made as Sodom, and
had bene like to Gomorrha. 30 What shall
we say then? That the Gentiles which
folowed not righteousnes, haue attained
vnto righteousnes, euen the righteousnes
which is of faith. 31 But Israel which
followed the Lawe of righteousnes, could
not arteine vnto the Law of righteousnes.
32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not
by faith, but as it were by the workes
of the Lawe: for they haue stumbled at
the stumbling stone, 33 As it is written,
Beholde, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone,
and a rocke to make men fall: and euery
one that beleeueth in him, shall not be
ashamed.
10
Brethren, mine hearts desire and
prayer to God for Israel is, that they might
be saued. 2 For I beare them record,
that they haue the zeale of God, but not
according to knowledge. 3 For they, being
ignorant of the righteousnes of God, and
going about to stablish their owne righ-
teousnes, haue not submitted themselues
to the righteousnes of God. 4 For Christ is
the end of the Law for righteousnes vnto
euery one that beleeueth. 5 For Moses
thus describeth the righteousnes which is
of the Lawe, That the man which doeth
1Romans 10:6
990
these things, shall liue thereby. 6 But the
righteousnes which is of faith, speaketh
on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who
shall ascend into heauen? (that is to
bring Christ from aboue) 7 Or, Who shall
descend into the deepe? (that is to bring
Christ againe from the dead) 8 But what
sayth it? The worde is neere thee, euen
in thy mouth, and in thine heart. This
is the worde of faith which we preach.
9 For if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth
the Lord Iesus, and shalt beleeue in thine
heart, that God raised him vp from the
dead, thou shalt be saued: 10 For with the
heart man beleeueth vnto righteousnes,
and with the mouth man confesseth to
11 For the Scripture saith,
saluation.
Whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shall not be
ashamed. 12 For there is no difference
betweene the Iewe and the Grecian: for
he that is Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all,
that call on him. 13 For whosoeuer shall
call vpon the Name of the Lord, shalbe
saued. 14 But how shall they call on him,
in whome they haue not beleeued? and
how shall they beleeue in him, of whom
they haue not heard? and howe shall they
heare without a preacher? 15 And how
shall they preach, except they be sent?
as it is written, Howe beautifull are the
feete of them which bring glad tidings
of peace, and bring glad tidings of good
things! 16 But they haue not all obeyed ye
Gospel: for Esaias saith, Lord, who hath
beleeued our report? 17 Then faith is by
hearing, and hearing by the worde of God.
18 But I demaund, Haue they not heard?
No doubt their sound went out through all
the earth, and their wordes into the endes
of the worlde. 19 But I demaund, Did not
Israel knowe God? First Moses sayth, I
will prouoke you to enuie by a nation that
is not my nation, and by a foolish nation
I will anger you. 20 And Esaias is bolde,
and saith, I was found of them that sought
me not, and haue bene made manifest
to them that asked not after me. 21 And
vnto Israel hee sayth, All the day long
haue I stretched foorth mine hand vnto
a disobedient, and gainesaying people.
Romans 11:16
11
1 I Demaund then, Hath God cast away
his people? God forbid: for I also am an
Israelite, of the seede of Abraham, of the
tribe of Beniamin. 2 God hath not cast
away his people which he knew before.
Know ye not what the Scripture sayth
of Elias, howe hee communeth with God
against Israel, saying, 3 Lord, they haue
killed thy Prophets, and digged downe
thine altars: and I am left alone, and
they seeke my life? 4 But what saith
the answere of God to him? I haue
reserued vnto my selfe seuen thousand
men, which haue not bowed the knee to
Baal. 5 Euen so then at this present time is
there a remnant according to the election
of grace. 6 And if it be of grace, it is
no more of workes: or els were grace
no more grace: but if it be of workes,
it is no more grace: or els were worke
no more worke. 7 What then? Israel
hath not obtained that he sought: but
the election hath obteined it, and the rest
haue bene hardened, 8 According as it is
written, God hath giuen them the spirit
of slumber: eyes that they should not see,
and eares that they should not heare vnto
this day. 9 And Dauid sayth, Let their
table be made a snare, and a net, and a
stumbling blocke, euen for a recompence
vnto them. 10 Let their eyes be darkened
that they see not, and bowe downe their
backe alwayes. 11 I demaund then, Haue
they stumbled, that they should fall? God
forbid: but through their fall, saluation
commeth vnto the Gentiles, to prouoke
them to follow them. 12 Wherefore if the
fall of them be the riches of the world,
and the diminishing of them the riches of
the Gentiles, how much more shall their
aboundance be? 13 For in that I speake
to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the
Apostle of ye Gentiles, I magnifie mine
office, 14 To trie if by any meanes I might
prouoke them of my flesh to follow them,
and might saue some of them. 15 For if the
casting away of them be the reconciling
of the world, what shall the receiuing
be, but life from the dead? 16 For if
the first fruites be holy, so is the wholeRomans 11:17
991
lumpe: and if the roote be holy, so are
the branches. 17 And though some of
the branches be broken off, and thou
being a wilde Oliue tree, wast graft in
for them, and made partaker of the roote,
and fatnesse of the Oliue tree. 18 Boast
not thy selfe against the branches: and
if thou boast thy selfe, thou bearest not
the roote, but the roote thee. 19 Thou wilt
say then, The branches are broken off,
that I might be graft in. 20 Well: through
vnbeliefe they are broken off, and thou
standest by faith: bee not hie minded,
but feare. 21 For if God spared not the
naturall branches, take heede, least he
also spare not thee. 22 Beholde therefore
the bountifulnesse, and seueritie of God:
towarde them which haue fallen, seuer-
itie: but toward thee, bountifulnesse, if
thou continue in his bountifulnesse: or
els thou shalt also be cut off. 23 And they
also, if they abide not still in vnbeliefe,
shall be graffed in: for God is able to
graffe them in againe. 24 For if thou
wast cut out of the Oliue tree, which
was wilde by nature, and wast graffed
contrary to nature in a right Oliue tree,
how much more shall they that are by
nature, bee graffed in their owne Oliue
tree? 25 For I would not, brethren, that
ye should be ignorant of this secret (least
ye should bee arrogant in your selues)
that partly obstinacie is come to Israel,
vntill the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come
in. 26 And so all Israel shalbe saued, as
it is written, The deliuerer shall come
out of Sion, and shall turne away the
vngodlinesse from Iacob. 27 And this is my
couenant to them, When I shall take away
their sinnes. 28 As concerning the Gospel,
they are enemies for your sakes: but as
touching the election, they are beloued
for the fathers sakes. 29 For the giftes and
calling of God are without repentance.
30 For euen as yee in times past haue not
beleeued God, yet haue nowe obteined
mercie through their vnbeliefe: 31 Euen
so nowe haue they not beleeued by the
mercie shewed vnto you, that they also
may obtaine mercie. 32 For God hath
shut vp all in vnbeliefe, that he might
Romans 12:12
haue mercie on all. 33 O the deepenesse
of the riches, both of the wisdome, and
knowledge of God! howe vnsearcheable
are his iudgements, and his wayes past
finding out! 34 For who hath knowen
the minde of the Lord? or who was his
counsellour? 35 Or who hath giuen vnto
him first, and he shalbe recompensed?
36 For of him, and through him, and for
him are all things: to him be glory for
euer. Amen.
12
1 I Beseech you therefore brethren, by
the mercies of God, that yee giue vp your
bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy, accept-
able vnto God, which is your reasonable
seruing of God. 2 And fashion not your
selues like vnto this worlde, but bee yee
changed by the renewing of your minde,
that ye may prooue what that good, and
acceptable and perfect will of God is. 3 For
I say through the grace that is giuen vnto
me, to euery one that is among you, that
no man presume to vnderstande aboue
that which is meete to vnderstand, but
that he vnderstande according to sobri-
etie, as God hath dealt to euery man the
measure of faith. 4 For as wee haue many
members in one body, and all members
haue not one office, 5 So we being many
are one body in Christ, and euery one, one
anothers members. 6 Seeing then that we
haue gifts that are diuers, according to
the grace that is giuen vnto vs, whether
we haue prophecie, let vs prophecie ac-
cording to the portion of faith: 7 Or an
office, let vs waite on the office: or he that
teacheth, on teaching: 8 Or he that exhort-
eth, on exhortation: he that distributeth,
let him doe it with simplicitie: he that
ruleth, with diligence: he that sheweth
mercie, with cheerefulnesse. 9 Let loue
be without dissimulation. Abhorre that
which is euill, and cleaue vnto that which
is good. 10 Be affectioned to loue one
another with brotherly loue. In giuing
honour, goe one before another, 11 Not
slouthfull to do seruice: seruent in spirit
seruing the Lord, 12 Reioycing in hope, pa-
cient in tribulation, continuing in prayer,Romans 12:13
992
13 Distributing vnto the necessities of the
Saintes: giuing your selues to hospitali-
tie. 14 Blesse them which persecute you:
blesse, I say, and curse not. 15 Reioyce
with them that reioyce, and weepe with
them that weepe. 16 Be of like affection
one towardes another: be not hie minded:
but make your selues equall to them
of the lower sort: be not wise in your
selues. 17 Recompence to no man euill
for euill: procure things honest in the
sight of all men. 18 If it bee possible,
as much as in you is, haue peace with
all men. 19 Dearely beloued, auenge not
your selues, but giue place vnto wrath:
for it is written, Vengeance is mine: I
will repay, saith the Lord. 20 Therefore,
if thine enemie hunger, feede him: if he
thirst, giue him drinke: for in so doing,
thou shalt heape coales of fire on his
head. 21 Bee not ouercome of euill, but
ouercome euill with goodnesse.
13
1 Let euery soule be subiect vnto the
higher powers: for there is no power but
of God: and the powers that be, are or-
deined of God. 2 Whosoeuer therefore re-
sisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
of God: and they that resist, shall re-
ceiue to themselues condemnation. 3 For
Magistrates are not to be feared for good
workes, but for euill. Wilt thou then bee
without feare of the power? doe well: so
shalt thou haue praise of the same. 4 For
he is ye minister of God for thy wealth,
but if thou do euill, feare: for he beareth
not the sworde for nought: for he is the
minister of God to take vengeance on him
that doeth euill. 5 Wherefore ye must
bee subiect, not because of wrath only,
but also for conscience sake. 6 For, for
this cause ye pay also tribute: for they
are Gods ministers, applying themselues
for the same thing. 7 Giue to all men
therefore their duetie: tribute, to whome
yee owe tribute: custome, to whom cus-
tome: feare, to whome feare: honour, to
whom ye owe honour. 8 Owe nothing to
any man, but to loue one another: for
he that loueth another, hath fulfilled the
Romans 14:8
Lawe. 9 For this, Thou shalt not commit
adulterie, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt
not steale, Thou shalt not beare false
witnes, Thou shalt not couet: and if there
be any other commandement, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, euen in
this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as
thy selfe. 10 Loue doeth not euill to his
neighbour: therefore is loue the fulfilling
of the Lawe. 11 And that, considering
the season, that it is now time that we
should arise from sleepe: for now is our
saluation neerer, then when we beleeued
it. 12 The night is past, and the day
is at hande, let vs therefore cast away
the workes of darkenesse, and let vs put
on the armour of light, 13 So that wee
walke honestly, as in the day: not in
gluttonie, and drunkennesse, neither in
chambering and wantonnes, nor in strife
and enuying. 14 But put yee on the Lord
JESUS CHRIST, and take no thought for the
flesh, to fulfill the lustes of it.
14
1 Him that is weake in the faith, receiue
vnto you, but not for controuersies of
disputations. 2 One beleeueth that he may
eate of all things: and another, which is
weake, eateth herbes. 3 Let not him that
eateth, despise him that eateth not: and
let not him which eateth not, condemne
him that eateth: for God hath receiued
him. 4 Who art thou that condemnest
another mans seruant? hee standeth or
falleth to his owne master: yea, he shalbe
established: for God is able to make him
stand. 5 This man esteemeth one day
aboue another day, and another man
counteth euery day alike: let euery man
be fully perswaded in his minde. 6 He
that obserueth the day, obserueth it to
the Lord: and he that obserueth not the
day, obserueth it not to the Lord. He
that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he
giueth God thankes: and he that eateth
not, eateth not to the Lord, and giueth
God thankes. 7 For none of vs liueth
to himselfe, neither doeth any die to
himselfe. 8 For whether wee liue, we
liue vnto the Lord: or whether we die,
we die vnto the Lord: whether we liueRomans 14:9
993
therefore, or die, we are the Lords. 9 For
Christ therefore died and rose againe, and
reuiued, that he might be Lord both of
the dead and the quicke. 10 But why
doest thou condemne thy brother? or
why doest thou despise thy brother? for
we shall all appeare before the iudgement
seate of Christ. 11 For it is written, I liue,
sayth the Lord, and euery knee shall bowe
to me, and all tongues shall confesse vnto
God. 12 So then euery one of vs shall
giue accounts of himselfe to God. 13 Let
vs not therefore iudge one another any
more: but vse your iudgement rather in
this, that no man put an occasion to fall,
or a stumbling blocke before his brother.
14 I know, and am perswaded through the
Lord Iesus, that there is nothing vncleane
of it selfe: but vnto him that iudgeth
any thing to be vncleane, to him it is
vncleane. 15 But if thy brother be grieued
for the meate, nowe walkest thou not
charitably: destroy not him with thy
meate, for whome Christ dyed. 16 Cause
not your commoditie to be euill spoken
of. 17 For the kingdome of God, is not
meate nor drinke, but righteousnes, and
peace, and ioye in the holy Ghost. 18 For
whosoeuer in these things serueth Christ,
is acceptable vnto God, and is approoued
of men. 19 Let vs then follow those things
which concerne peace, and wherewith
one may edifie another. 20 Destroy not
the worke of God for meates sake: all
things in deede are pure: but it is euill
for the man which eateth with offence.
21 It is good neither to eate flesh, nor
to drinke wine, nor any thing whereby
thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or
made weake. 22 Hast thou faith? haue
it with thy selfe before God: blessed
is hee that condemneth not himselfe in
23 For
that thing which he aloweth.
he that doubteth, is condemned if he
eate, because he eateth not of faith: and
whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne.
Romans 15:18
euery man please his neighbour in that
that is good to edification. 3 For Christ
also would not please himselfe, but as it
is written, The rebukes of them which
rebuke thee, fell on me. 4 For what-
soeuer things are written aforetime, are
writte for our learning, that we through
patience, and comfort of the Scriptures
might haue hope. 5 Now the God of
patience and consolation giue you that
ye be like minded one towards another,
according to Christ Iesus, 6 That ye with
one minde, and with one mouth may
prayse God, euen the Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ. 7 Wherefore receiue ye one
another, as Christ also receiued vs to the
glory of God. 8 Nowe I say, that Iesus
Christ was a minister of the circumcision,
for the trueth of God, to confirme the
promises made vnto the fathers. 9 And let
the Gentiles prayse God, for his mercie, as
it is written, For this cause I wil confesse
thee among the Gentiles, and sing vnto
thy Name. 10 And againe he saith, Reioyce,
11 And
ye Gentiles with his people.
againe, Prayse the Lord, all ye Gentiles,
and laude ye him, all people together.
12 And againe Esaias sayth, There shall be
a roote of Iesse, and hee that shall rise to
reigne ouer the Gentiles, in him shall the
Gentiles trust. 13 Nowe the God of hope fill
you with all ioye, and peace in beleeuing,
that ye may abound in hope, through the
power of the holy Ghost. 14 And I my selfe
also am perswaded of you, my brethren,
that ye also are full of goodnes, and
filled with all knowledge, and are able to
admonish one another. 15 Neuerthelesse,
brethren, I haue somewhat boldly after a
sort written vnto you, as one that putteth
you in remembrance, through the grace
that is giuen me of God, 16 That I should
be the minister of Iesus Christ toward the
Gentiles, ministring the Gospel of God,
that the offering vp of the Gentiles might
be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy
Ghost. 17 I haue therefore whereof I may
reioyce in Christ Iesus in those things

Gentiles obedient in worde and deede,
19 With the power of signes and wonders,
by the power of the Spirit of God: so that
from Hierusalem, and round about vnto
Illyricum, I haue caused to abound the
Gospel of Christ. 20 Yea, so I enforced
my selfe to preach the Gospel, not where
Christ was named, lest I should haue built
on another mans foundation. 21 But as it
is written, To whome hee was not spoken
of, they shall see him, and they that heard
not, shall vnderstand him. 22 Therefore
also I haue bene oft let to come vnto
you: 23 But nowe seeing I haue no more
place in these quarters, and also haue
bene desirous many yeeres agone to come
vnto you, 24 When I shall take my iourney
into Spaine, I will come to you: for I
trust to see you in my iourney, and to
be brought on my way thitherward by
you, after that I haue bene somewhat
filled with your company. 25 But now
go I to Hierusalem, to minister vnto the
Saints. 26 For it hath pleased them of
Macedonia and Achaia, to make a cer-
taine distribution vnto the poore Saints
which are at Hierusalem. 27 For it hath
pleased them, and their detters are they:
for if the Gentiles be made partakers of
their spirituall things, their duetie is also
to minister vnto them in carnall things.
28 When I haue therefore performed this,
and haue sealed them this fruite, I will
passe by you into Spaine. 29 And I knowe
when I come, that I shall come to you with
abundance of the blessing of the Gospel
of Christ. 30 Also brethren, I beseeche you
for our Lord Iesus Christes sake, and for
the loue of the spirit, that ye would striue
with me by prayers to God for me, 31 That
I may be deliuered from them which are
disobedient in Iudea, and that my seruice
which I haue to doe at Hierusalem, may
be accepted of the Saintes, 32 That I may
come vnto you with ioy by the will of God,
and may with you be refreshed. 33 Thus
the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

both their Lord, and ours: 3 Grace be with
you, and peace from God our Father, and
from the Lord Iesus Christ. 4 I thanke
my God alwayes on your behalfe for the
grace of God, which is giuen you in Iesus
Christ, 5 That in all things ye are made
rich in him, in all kinde of speach, and
in all knowledge: 6 As the testimonie
of Iesus Christ hath bene confirmed in
you: 7 So that ye are not destitute of
any gift: wayting for the appearing of
our Lord Iesus Christ. 8 Who shall also
confirme you vnto the ende, that ye may
be blamelesse, in the day of our Lord
Iesus Christ. 9 God is faithfull, by whom ye
are called vnto the fellowship of his Sonne
Iesus Christ our Lord. 10 Nowe I beseeche
you, brethren, by the Name of our Lord
Iesus Christ, that ye all speake one thing,
and that there be no dissensions among
you: but be ye knit together in one mind,
and in one iudgement. 11 For it hath bene
declared vnto me, my brethren, of you
by them that are of the house of Cloe,
that there are contentions among you.
12 Nowe this I say, that euery one of you
saith, I am Pauls, and I am Apollos, and I
am Cephas, and I am Christs. 13 Is Christ
deuided? was Paul crucified for you?
either were ye baptized into the name of
Paul? 14 I thanke God, that I baptized
none of you, but Crispus, and Gaius,
15 Lest any should say, that I had baptized
into mine owne name. 16 I baptized also
the houshold of Stephanas: furthermore
knowe I not, whether I baptized any
other. 17 For CHRIST sent me not to
baptize, but to preache the Gospel, not
1 Corinthians 2:3
with wisdome of wordes, lest the crosse
of Christ should be made of none effect.
18 For that preaching of the crosse is to
them that perish, foolishnesse: but vnto
vs, which are saued, it is the power of
God. 19 For it is written, I will destroy
the wisedome of the wise, and will cast
away the vnderstanding of the prudent.
20 Where is the wise? where is the Scribe?
where is the disputer of this worlde?
hath not God made the wisedome of this
worlde foolishnesse? 21 For seeing the
worlde by wisedome knewe not God in
the wisedome of GOD, it pleased God
by the foolishnesse of preaching to saue
them that beleeue: 22 Seeing also that the
Iewes require a signe, and the Grecians
seeke after wisdome. 23 But wee preach
Christ crucified: vnto the Iewes, euen a
stumbling blocke, and vnto the Grecians,
foolishnesse: 24 But vnto them which are
called, both of the Iewes and Grecians,
we preach Christ, the power of God, and
the wisedome of God. 25 For the foolish-
nesse of God is wiser then men, and the
weakenesse of God is stronger then men.
26 For brethren, you see your calling, how
that not many wise men after the flesh,
not many mighty, not many noble are
called. 27 But God hath chosen the foolish
thinges of the world to confound the wise,
and God hath chosen the weake thinges
of the worlde, to confound the mightie
things, 28 And vile things of the worlde
and thinges which are despised, hath God
chosen, and thinges which are not, to
bring to nought thinges that are, 29 That
no flesh shoulde reioyce in his presence.
30 But ye are of him in Christ Iesus,
who of God is made vnto vs wisedome
and righteousnesse, and sanctification,
and redemption, 31 That, according as it
is written, Hee that reioyceth, let him
reioyce in the Lord.
2
1 And I, brethren, when I came to you,
came not with excellencie of woordes,
or of wisedome, shewing vnto you the
testimonie of God. 2 For I esteemed not
to knowe any thing among you, saue
Iesus Christ, and him crucified. 3 And I1 Corinthians 2:4
997
was among you in weakenesse, and in
feare, and in much trembling. 4 Neither
stoode my woorde, and my preaching in
the entising speach of mans wisdom, but
in plaine euidence of the Spirite and of
power, 5 That your faith should not be in
the wisdome of men, but in the power of
God. 6 And we speake wisedome among
them that are perfect: not the wisedome
of this world, neither of the princes of
this world, which come to nought. 7 But
we speake the wisedome of God in a
mysterie, euen the hid wisedom, which
God had determined before the world,
vnto our glory. 8 Which none of the
princes of this world hath knowen: for
had they knowen it, they would not haue
crucified the Lord of glory. 9 But as it is
written, The thinges which eye hath not
seene, neither eare hath heard, neither
came into mans heart, are, which God
hath prepared for them that loue him.
10 But God hath reueiled them vnto vs
by his Spirit: for the spirit searcheth all
things, yea, the deepe things of God. 11 For
what man knoweth the things of a man,
saue the spirite of a man, which is in
him? euen so the things of God knoweth
no man, but the spirit of God. 12 Nowe
we haue receiued not the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit, which is of God,
that we might knowe the thinges that
are giuen to vs of God. 13 Which things
also we speake, not in the woordes which
mans wisedome teacheth, but which the
holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spirituall
things with spirituall things. 14 But the
naturall man perceiueth not the things of
the Spirit of God: for they are foolishnesse
vnto him: neither can hee knowe them,
because they are spiritually discerned.
15 But hee that is spirituall, discerneth all
things: yet he himselfe is iudged of no
man. 16 For who hath knowen the minde
of the Lord, that hee might instruct him?
But we haue the minde of Christ.
1 Corinthians 3:20
2 I
gaue you milke to drinke, and not
meat: for yee were not yet able to beare
it, neither yet nowe are yee able. 3 For
yee are yet carnall: for whereas there
is among you enuying, and strife, and
diuisions, are ye not carnall, and walke as
men? 4 For when one sayeth, I am Pauls,
and another, I am Apollos, are yee not
carnall? 5 Who is Paul then? and who is
Apollos, but the ministers by whome yee
beleeued, and as the Lord gaue to euery
man? 6 I haue planted, Apollos watred,
but God gaue the increase. 7 So then,
neither is hee that planteth any thing, nei-
ther hee that watreth, but God that giueth
the increase. 8 And he that planteth,
and he that watreth, are one, and euery
man shall receiue his wages, according to
his labour. 9 For we together are Gods
labourers: yee are Gods husbandrie, and
Gods building. 10 According to the grace
of God giuen to mee, as a skilfull master
builder, I haue laide the foundation, and
another buildeth thereon: but let euery
man take heede how he buildeth vpon
it. 11 For other foundation can no man
laie, then that which is laied, which is
Iesus Christ. 12 And if any man builde
on this foundation, golde, siluer, precious
stones, timber, haye, or stubble, 13 Euery
mans worke shalbe made manifest: for
the day shall declare it, because it shalbe
reueiled by the fire: and the fire shall trie
euery mans worke of what sort it is. 14 If
any mans worke, that he hath built vpon,
abide, he shall receiue wages. 15 If any
mans worke burne, he shall lose, but he
shalbe saued himselfe: neuerthelesse yet
as it were by the fire. 16 Knowe ye not
that ye are the Temple of God, and that
the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 17 If any
man destroy the Temple of God, him shall
God destroy: for the Temple of God is
holy, which ye are. 18 Let no man deceiue
himselfe: If any man among you seeme to
be wise in this world, let him be a foole,
that he may be wise. 19 For the wisdome
of this worlde is foolishnesse with God:
3
1 And I could not speake vnto you, for it is written, He catcheth the wise in
20 And againe,
brethren, as vnto spirituall men, but as their owne craftinesse.
vnto carnall, euen as vnto babes in Christ. The Lord knoweth that the thoughtes1 Corinthians 3:21
998
of the wise be vaine. 21 Therefore let
no man reioyce in men: for all things
are yours. 22 Whether it be Paul, or
Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
death: whether they be things present, or
thinges to come, euen all are yours, 23 And
ye Christes, and Christ Gods.
4
1 Let a man so thinke of vs, as of the
ministers of Christ, and disposers of the
secrets of God: 2 And as for the rest, it
is required of the disposers, that euery
man be found faithfull. 3 As touching me,
I passe very litle to be iudged of you, or
of mans iudgement: no, I iudge not mine
owne selfe. 4 For I know nothing by my
selfe, yet am I not thereby iustified: but he
that iudgeth me, is the Lord. 5 Therefore
iudge nothing before the time, vntill the
Lord come, who will lighten things that
are hid in darkenesse, and make the
counsels of the hearts manifest: and
then shall euery man haue praise of God.
6 Nowe these things, brethren, I haue
figuratiuely applied vnto mine owne selfe
and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye might
learne by vs, that no man presume aboue
that which is written, that one swell not
against another for any mans cause. 7 For
who separateth thee? and what hast thou,
that thou hast not receiued? if thou hast
receiued it, why reioycest thou, as though
thou haddest not receiued it? 8 Nowe ye
are full: nowe ye are made rich: ye reigne
as kings without vs, and would to God ye
did reigne, that we also might reigne with
you. 9 For I thinke that God hath set forth
vs the last Apostles, as men appointed to
death: for we are made a gasing stocke
vnto the worlde, and to the Angels, and
to men. 10 We are fooles for Christes sake,
and ye are wise in Christ: we are weake,
and ye are strong: ye are honourable, and
we are despised. 11 Vnto this houre we
both hunger, and thirst, and are naked,
and are buffeted, and haue no certaine
dwelling place, 12 And labour, working
with our owne handes: we are reuiled,
and yet we blesse: we are persecuted, and
suffer it. 13 We are euill spoken of, and
1 Corinthians 5:8
we pray: we are made as the filth of the
world, the offskowring of all things, vnto
this time. 14 I write not these things to
shame you, but as my beloued children
I admonish you. 15 For though ye haue
tenne thousand instructours in Christ, yet
haue ye not many fathers: for in Christ
Iesus I haue begotten you through the
Gospel. 16 Wherefore, I pray you, be ye
folowers of me. 17 For this cause haue
I sent vnto you Timotheus, which is my
beloued sonne, and faithfull in the Lord,
which shall put you in remembrance of
my wayes in Christ as I teache euery
where in euery Church. 18 Some are
puffed vp as though I woulde not come
vnto you. 19 But I will come to you shortly,
if the Lord will, and will knowe, not the
wordes of them which are puffed vp, but
the power. 20 For the kingdome of God is
not in worde, but in power. 21 What will
ye? shall I come vnto you with a rod, or
in loue, and in ye spirite of meekenes?
1 It
5
is heard certainely that there is
fornication among you: and such forni-
cation as is not once named among the
Gentiles, that one should haue his fathers
wife. 2 And ye are puffed vp and haue not
rather sorowed, that he which hath done
this deede, might be put from among
you. 3 For I verely as absent in bodie,
but present in spirit, haue determined
already as though I were present, that he
that hath thus done this thing, 4 When
ye are gathered together, and my spirit,
in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ,
that such one, I say, by the power of
our Lord Iesus Christ, 5 Be deliuered vnto
Satan, for the destruction of the flesh,
that the spirit may be saued in the day
of the Lord Iesus. 6 Your reioycing is not
good: knowe ye not that a litle leauen,
leaueneth ye whole lumpe? 7 Purge out
therefore the olde leauen, that ye may
be a newe lumpe, as ye are vnleauened:
for Christ our Passeouer is sacrificed for
vs. 8 Therefore let vs keepe the feast, not
with olde leauen, neither in the leauen of
maliciousnes and wickednesse: but with1 Corinthians 5:9
999
the vnleauened bread of synceritie and
trueth. 9 I wrote vnto you in an Epistle,
that ye should not companie together
with fornicatours, 10 And not altogether
with the fornicatours of this world, or
with the couetous, or with extortioners,
or with idolaters: for then ye must goe out
of the world. 11 But nowe I haue written
vnto you, that ye companie not together:
if any that is called a brother, be a forni-
catour, or couetous, or an idolater, or a
rayler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner,
with such one eate not. 12 For what haue
I to doe, to iudge them also which are
without? doe ye not iudge them that are
within? 13 But God iudgeth them that are
without. Put away therefore from among
your selues that wicked man.
1 Dare
6
any of you, hauing businesse
against an other, be iudged vnder the
vniust, and not vnder the Saintes? 2 Doe
ye not knowe, that the Saintes shall iudge
the worlde? If the worlde then shalbe
iudged by you, are ye vnworthie to iudge
the smallest matters? 3 Knowe ye not
that we shall iudge the Angels? howe
much more, things that perteine to this
life? 4 If then ye haue iudgements of
things perteining to this life, set vp them
which are least esteemed in the Church.
5 I speake it to your shame.
Is it so
that there is not a wise man among you?
no not one, that can iudge betweene his
brethren? 6 But a brother goeth to law
with a brother, and that vnder the infi-
dels. 7 Nowe therefore there is altogether
infirmitie in you, in that yee goe to lawe
one with another: why rather suffer ye
not wrong? why rather susteine yee not
harme? 8 Nay, yee your selues doe wrong,
and doe harme, and that to your brethren.
9 Knowe yee not that the vnrighteous shall
not inherite the kingdome of God? Be
not deceiued: neither fornicatours, nor
idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons,
nor buggerers, 10 Nor theeues, nor cou-
etous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor
extortioners shall inherite the kingdome
of God. 11 And such were some of you: but
1 Corinthians 7:6
yee are washed, but yee are sanctified,
but yee are iustified in the Name of the
Lord Iesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
12 All thinges are lawfull vnto mee, but all
thinges are not profitable. I may doe all
things, but I will not be brought vnder
the power of any thing. 13 Meates are
ordeined for the bellie, and the belly for
the meates: but God shall destroy both
it, and them. Nowe the bodie is not for
fornication, but for the Lord, and the
Lord for the bodie. 14 And God hath
also raised vp the Lord, and shall raise
vs vp by his power. 15 Knowe yee not,
that your bodies are the members of
Christ? shall I then take the members
of Christ, and make them the members
of an harlot? God forbid. 16 Doe ye not
knowe, that he which coupleth himselfe
with an harlot, is one body? for two,
sayeth he, shalbe one flesh. 17 But hee
that is ioyned vnto the Lord, is one spirite.
18 Flee fornication: euery sinne that a
man doeth, is without the bodie: but
hee that committeth fornication, sinneth
against his owne bodie. 19 Knowe yee not,
that your body is the temple of the holy
Ghost, which is in you, whom ye haue of
God? and yee are not your owne. 20 For
yee are bought for a price: therefore
glorifie God in your bodie, and in your
spirit: for they are Gods.
7
1 Nowe concerning the thinges whereof
ye wrote vnto mee, It were good for a man
not to touche a woman. 2 Neuertheles, to
auoide fornication, let euery man haue
his wife, and let euery woman haue
her owne husband. 3 Let the husband
giue vnto the wife due beneuolence, and
likewise also the wife vnto the husband.
4 The wife hath not the power of her owne
bodie, but ye husband: and likewise also
the husband hath not ye power of his
own body, but the wife. 5 Defraude not
one another, except it be with consent
for a time, that ye may giue your selues
to fasting and praier, and againe come
together that Satan tempt you not for
your incontinecie. 6 But I speake this by1 Corinthians 7:7
1000
permission, not by commandement. 7 For
I woulde that all men were euen as I my
selfe am: but euery man hath his proper
gift of God, one after this maner, and
another after that. 8 Therefore I say vnto
the vnmaried, and vnto the widowes, It
is good for them if they abide euen as
I doe. 9 But if they cannot abstaine, let
them marrie: for it is better to marrie
then to burne. 10 And vnto ye maried I
comand, not I, but ye Lord, Let not ye wife
depart from her husband. 11 But and if
shee depart, let her remaine vnmaried, or
be reconciled vnto her husband, and let
not the husband put away his wife. 12 But
to ye remnant I speake, and not ye Lord,
If any brother haue a wife, ye beleeueth
not, if she be content to dwell with him,
let him not forsake her. 13 And the woman
which hath an husband that beleeueth
not, if he be content to dwell with her, let
her not forsake him. 14 For the vnbeleeu-
ing husband is sanctified to the wife,
and the vnbeleeuing wife is sanctified
to the husband, els were your children
vncleane: but nowe are they holie. 15 But
if the vnbeleeuing depart, let him depart:
a brother or a sister is not in subiection
in such things: but God hath called vs in
peace. 16 For what knowest thou, O wife,
whether thou shalt saue thine husband?
Or what knowest thou, O man, whether
thou shalt saue thy wife? 17 But as God
hath distributed to euery man, as the
Lord hath called euery one, so let him
walke: and so ordaine I, in all Churches.
18 Is any man called being circumcised?
let him not gather his vncircumcision:
is any called vncircumcised? let him
not be circumcised. 19 Circumcision is
nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing,
but the keeping of the commandements of
God. 20 Let euery man abide in the same
vocation wherein he was called. 21 Art
thou called being a seruant? care not
for it: but if yet thou maiest be free,
vse it rather. 22 For he that is called in
the Lord, being. a seruant, is the Lords
freeman: likewise also he that is called
being free, is Christes seruant. 23 Yee
are bought with a price: be not the
seruants of men. 24 Brethren, let euery
1 Corinthians 7:39
man, wherein hee was called, therein
abide with God. 25 Nowe concerning
virgines, I haue no commandement of the
Lord: but I giue mine aduise, as one that
hath obtained mercie of the Lord to be
faithfull. 26 I suppose then this to bee
good for the present necessitie: I meane
that it is good for a man so to be. 27 Art
thou bounde vnto a wife? seeke not to
be loosed: art thou loosed from a wife?
seeke not a wife. 28 But if thou takest a
wife, thou sinnest not: and if a virgine
marrie, shee sinneth not: neuerthelesse,
such shall haue trouble in the flesh: but
I spare you. 29 And this I say, brethren,
because the time is short, hereafter that
both they which haue wiues, be as though
they had none: 30 And they that weepe,
as though they wept not: and they that
reioyce, as though they reioyced not: and
they that bye, as though they possessed
not: 31 And they that vse this worlde, as
though they vsed it not: for the fashion of
this worlde goeth away. 32 And I would
haue you without care. The vnmaried
careth for the things of the Lord, howe
he may please the Lord. 33 But hee that is
maried, careth for the things of the world,
how he may please his wife. 34 There is
difference also betweene a virgine and
a wife: the vnmaried woman careth for
the things of the Lord, that she may be
holy, both in body and in spirite: but
shee that is maried, careth for the things
of the worlde, howe shee may please her
husband. 35 And this I speake for your
owne commoditie, not to tangle you in
a snare, but that yee follow that, which
is honest, and that yee may cleaue fast
vnto the Lord without separation. 36 But
if any man thinke that it is vncomely for
his virgine, if shee passe the flower of
her age, and neede so require, let him
do what he will, he sinneth not: let them
be maried. 37 Neuerthelesse, hee that
standeth firme in his heart, that hee hath
no neede, but hath power ouer his owne
will, and hath so decreed in his heart,
that hee will keepe his virgine, hee doeth
well. 38 So then hee that giueth her to
mariage, doeth well, but he that giueth
her not to mariage, doeth better. 39 The1 Corinthians 7:40
1001
wife is bounde by the Lawe, as long as
her husband liueth: but if her husband
bee dead, shee is at libertie to marie with
whome she will, onely in the Lord. 40 But
shee is more blessed, if she so abide, in
my iudgement: and I thinke that I haue
also the Spirite of God.

1 And as touching things sacrificed vnto
idols, wee knowe that wee all haue knowl-
edge: knowledge puffeth vp, but loue
2 Nowe, if any man thinke
edifieth.
that hee knoweth any thing, hee knoweth
nothing yet as hee ought to knowe. 3 But
if any man loue God, the same is knowen
of him. 4 Concerning therefore the eating
of things sacrificed vnto idoles, we knowe
that an idole is nothing in the worlde,
and that there is none other God but
one. 5 For though there bee that are
called gods, whether in heauen, or in
earth (as there be many gods, and many
lords) 6 Yet vnto vs there is but one God,
which is that Father, of whome are all
things, and we in him: and one Lord Iesus
Christ, by whome are all things, and we
by him. 7 But euery man hath not that
knowledge: for many hauing conscience
of the idole, vntill this houre, eate as a
thing sacrificed vnto the idole, and so
their conscience being weake, is defiled.
8 But meate maketh not vs acceptable to
God, for neither if we eate, haue we the
more: neither if we eate not, haue we the
lesse. 9 But take heede lest by any meanes
this power of yours be an occasion of
falling, to them that are weake. 10 For if
any man see thee which hast knowledge,
sit at table in the idoles temple, shall not
the conscience of him which is weake,
be boldened to eate those things which
are sacrificed to idoles? 11 And through
thy knowledge shall the weake brother
perish, for whome Christ died. 12 Nowe
when ye sinne so against the brethren,
and wound their weake conscience, ye

sinne against Christ.
meate offende my brother, I wil eate no
flesh while the world standeth, that I may
not offend my brother.
1 Corinthians 9:17
9
1 Am I not an Apostle?
am I not free?
haue I not seene Iesus Christ our Lord?
are ye not my worke in the Lord? 2 If I be
not an Apostle vnto other, yet doutlesse I
am vnto you: for ye are the seale of mine
Apostleship in the Lord. 3 My defence to
them that examine mee, is this, 4 Haue
we not power to eat and to drinke? 5 Or
haue we not power to lead about a wife
being a sister, as well as the rest of the
Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord,
and Cephas? 6 Or I only and Barnabas,
haue not we power not to worke? 7 Who
goeth a warfare any time at his owne
coste? who planteth a vineyarde, and
eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who
feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the
milke of the flocke? 8 Say I these thinges
according to man? saith not the Lawe
the same also? 9 For it is written in the
Lawe of Moses, Thou shalt not mussell
the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out
the corne: doeth God take care for oxen?
10 Either saith hee it not altogether for
our sakes? For our sakes no doubt it
is written, that he which eareth, should
eare in hope, and that he that thresheth
in hope, should be partaker of his hope.
11 If wee haue sowen vnto you spirituall
thinges, is it a great thing if we reape
your carnall thinges? 12 If others with you
bee partakers of this power, are not we
rather? neuerthelesse, we haue not vsed
this power: but suffer all things, that we
should not hinder the Gospel of Christ.
13 Doe ye not knowe, that they which
minister about the holy things, eate of the
things of the Temple? and they which
waite at the altar, are partakers with the
altar? 14 So also hath the Lord ordeined,
that they which preach ye Gospel, should
liue of the Gospel. 15 But I haue vsed none
of these things: neither wrote I these
things, that it should be so done vnto me:
for it were better for me to die, then that
any man should make my reioycing vaine.
16 For though I preach the Gospel, I haue
nothing to reioyce of: for necessitie is laid
vpon me, and woe is vnto me, if I preach
not the Gospel. 17 For if I do it willingly,
I haue a reward, but if I do it against my1 Corinthians 9:18
1002
will, notwithstanding the dispensation is
committed vnto me. 18 What is my reward
then? verely that when I preach the
Gospel, I make the Gospel of Christ free,
that I abuse not mine authoritie in ye
Gospel. 19 For though I bee free from all
men, yet haue I made my selfe seruant
vnto all men, that I might winne the moe.
20 And vnto the Iewes, I become as a
Iewe, that I may winne the Iewes: to
them that are vnder the Lawe, as though
I were vnder the Lawe, that I may winne
them that are vnder the Lawe: 21 To them
that are without Lawe, as though I were
without Lawe, (when I am not without
Lawe as pertaining to God, but am in the
Lawe through Christ) that I may winne
them that are without Lawe: 22 To the
weake I become as weake, that I may
winne the weake: I am made all thinges to
all men, that I might by all meanes saue
some. 23 And this I doe for the Gospels
sake, that I might be partaker thereof
with you. 24 Knowe ye not, that they
which runne in a race, runne all, yet one
receiueth the price? so runne that ye may
obtaine. 25 And euery man that proueth
masteries, abstaineth from all things: and
they do it to obtaine a corruptible crowne:
but we for an vncorruptible. 26 I therefore
so runne, not as vncertainely: so fight I,
not as one that beateth the ayre. 27 But I
beate downe my body, and bring it into
subiection, lest by any meanes after that I
haue preached to other, I my selfe should
be reproued.
10
1 Moreouer, brethren, I woulde not that
yee shoulde bee ignorant, that all our
fathers were vnder that cloude, and all
passed through that sea, 2 And were all
baptized vnto Moses, in that cloude, and
in that sea, 3 And did all eat the same
spiritual meat, 4 And did all drinke the
same spirituall drinke (for they dranke
of the spiritual Rocke that folowed them:
and the Rocke was Christ) 5 But with
many of them God was not pleased: for
they were ouerthrowen in ye wildernes.
6 Nowe these things are our ensamples,
1 Corinthians 10:24
to the intent that we should not lust after
euil things as they also lusted. 7 Neither
bee ye idolaters as were some of them,
as it is written, The people sate downe
to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play.
8 Neither let vs commit fornication, as
some of them committed fornication, and
fell in one day three and twentie thou-
sand. 9 Neither let vs tempt Christ, as
some of them also tempted him, and were
destroyed of serpents. 10 Neither mur-
mure ye, as some of them also murmured,
and were destroyed of the destroyer.
11 Nowe all these things came vnto them
for ensamples, and were written to ad-
monish vs, vpon whome the endes of
the world are come. 12 Wherefore, let
him that thinketh he standeth, take heede
lest he fall. 13 There hath no tentation
taken you, but such as appertaine to man:
and God is faithfull, which will not suffer
you to be tempted aboue that you be
able, but wil euen giue the issue with the
tentation, that ye may be able to beare
it. 14 Wherefore my beloued, flee from
idolatrie. 15 I speake as vnto them which
haue vnderstanding: iugde ye what I say.
16 The cup of blessing which we blesse,
is it not the communion of the blood
of Christ? The bread which we breake,
is it not the communion of the body of
Christ? 17 For we that are many, are one
bread and one body, because we all are
partakers of one bread. 18 Beholde Israel,
which is after the flesh: are not they
which eate of the sacrifices partakers of
the altar? 19 What say I then? that the
idole is any thing? or that that which is
sacrificed to idoles, is any thing? 20 Nay,
but that these things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to deuils, and not
vnto God: and I would not that ye should
haue fellowship with the deuils. 21 Ye can
not drinke the cup of the Lord, and the
cup of the deuils. Ye can not be partakers
of the Lords table, and of the table of the
deuils. 22 Doe we prouoke the Lord to
anger? are we stronger then he? 23 All
things are lawfull for me, but all things
are not expedient: all things are lawfull
for me, but all things edifie not. 24 Let1 Corinthians 10:25
1003
no man seeke his owne, but euery man
anothers wealth. 25 Whatsoeuer is solde
in the shambles, eate ye, and aske no
question for conscience sake. 26 For the
earth is the Lords, and all that therein
is. 27 If any of them which beleeue not,
call you to a feast, and if ye wil go,
whatsoeuer is set before you, eate, asking
no question for conscience sake. 28 But if
any man say vnto you, This is sacrificed
vnto idoles, eate it not, because of him
that shewed it, and for the conscience (for
the earth is the Lords, and all that therein
is) 29 And the conscience, I say, not thine,
but of that other: for why should my
libertie be condemned of another mans
conscience? 30 For if I through Gods ben-
efite be partaker, why am I euill spoken
of, for that wherefore I giue thankes?
31 Whether therefore ye eate, or drinke,
or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory
of God. 32 Giue none offence, neither to
the Iewes, nor to the Grecians, nor to the
Church of God: 33 Euen as I please all
men in all things, not seeking mine owne
profite, but the profite of many, that they
might be saued.
11
1 Be yee followers of mee, euen as I am
of Christ. 2 Now brethren, I commend
you, that ye remember all my things, and
keepe the ordinances, as I deliuered them
to you. 3 But I wil that ye know, that
Christ is the head of euery man: and
the man is the womans head: and God
is Christs head. 4 Euery man praying
or prophecying hauing any thing on his
head, dishonoureth his head. 5 But euery
woman that prayeth or prophecieth bare
headed, dishonoureth her head: for it is
euen one very thing, as though she were
shauen. 6 Therefore if the woman be not
couered, let her also be shorne: and if
it be shame for a woman to be shorne
or shauen, let her be couered. 7 For a
man ought not to couer his head: for
as much as he is the image and glory
of God: but the woman is the glory
of the man. 8 For the man is not of
the woman, but the woman of the man.
9 For the man was not created for the
1 Corinthians 11:27
womans sake: but the woman for the
mans sake. 10 Therefore ought the woman
to haue power on her head, because of the
Angels. 11 Neuertheles, neither is the man
without the woman, neither the woman
without the man in the Lord. 12 For
as the woman is of the man, so is the
man also by the woman: but all things
are of God. 13 Iudge in your selues, Is
it comely that a woman pray vnto God
vncouered? 14 Doeth not nature it selfe
teach you, that if a man haue long heare,
it is a shame vnto him? 15 But if a
woman haue long heare, it is a prayse
vnto her: for her heare is giuen her for
a couering. 16 But if any man lust to be
contentious, we haue no such custome,
neither the Churches of God. 17 Nowe
in this that I declare, I prayse you not,
that ye come together, not with profite,
but with hurt. 18 For first of all, when ye
come together in the Church, I heare that
there are dissentions among you: and I
beleeue it to be true in some part. 19 For
there must be heresies euen among you,
that they which are approoued among
you, might be knowen. 20 When ye come
together therefore into one place, this is
not to eate the Lords Supper. 21 For euery
man when they should eate, taketh his
owne supper afore, and one is hungry,
and another is drunken. 22 Haue ye not
houses to eate and to drinke in? despise
ye the Church of God, and shame them
that haue not? what shall I say to you?
shall I prayse you in this? I prayse you
not. 23 For I haue receiued of the Lord
that which I also haue deliuered vnto
you, to wit, That the Lord Iesus in the
night when he was betrayed, tooke bread:
24 And when hee had giuen thankes, hee
brake it, and sayde, Take, eate: this is
my body, which is broken for you: this
doe ye in remembrance of me. 25 After
the same maner also he tooke the cup,
when he had supped, saying, This cup is
the Newe Testament in my blood: this doe
as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of
me. 26 For as often as ye shall eate this
bread, and drinke this cup, ye shewe the
Lords death till hee come. 27 Wherefore,1 Corinthians 11:28
1004
whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and
drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily,
shall be guiltie of the body and blood
of the Lord. 28 Let euery man therefore
examine himselfe, and so let him eate of
this bread, and drinke of this cup. 29 For
he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily,
eateth and drinketh his owne damnation,
because he discerneth not the Lords body.
30 For this cause many are weake, and
sicke among you, and many sleepe. 31 For
if we would iudge our selues, we should
not be iudged. 32 But when we are iudged,
we are chastened of the Lord, because we
should not be condemned with the world.
33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
together to eate, tary one for another.
34 And if any man be hungry, let him eate
at home, that ye come not together vnto
condemnation. Other things will I set in
order when I come.
12
Now concerning spirituall giftes,
brethren, I would not haue you ignorant.
2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, and were
caried away vnto the dumme Idoles, as
ye were led. 3 Wherefore, I declare vnto
you, that no man speaking by the Spirit of
God calleth Iesus execrable: also no man
can say that Iesus is the Lord, but by the
holy Ghost. 4 Now there are diuersities
of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 And there
are diuersities of administrations, but the
same Lord, 6 And there are diuersities of
operations, but God is the same which
worketh all in all. 7 But the manifestation
of the Spirit is giuen to euery man, to
profite withall. 8 For to one is giuen by
the Spirit the word of wisdome: and to
an other the word of knowledge, by the
same Spirit: 9 And to another is giuen
faith by the same Spirit: and to another
the giftes of healing, by the same Spirit:
10 And to another the operations of great
workes: and to another, prophecie: and
to another, the discerning of spirits: and
to another, diuersities of tongues: and
to another, the interpretation of tongues.
11 And all these thinges worketh one and
the selfe same Spirit, distributing to euery
1
1 Corinthians 12:30
man seuerally as he will. 12 For as the
body is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of the body, which
is one, though they be many, yet are but
one body: euen so is Christ. 13 For by
one Spirit are we all baptized into one
body, whether we bee Iewes, or Grecians,
whether we be bonde, or free, and haue
bene all made to drinke into one Spirit.
14 For the body also is not one member,
but many. 15 If the foote would say,
Because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body, is it therefore not of the body?
16 And if the eare would say, Because I
am not the eye, I am not of the body,
is it therefore not of the body? 17 If the
whole body were an eye, where were
the hearing? If the whole were hearing,
where were the smellling? 18 But nowe
hath God disposed the members euery
one of them in the bodie at his owne plea-
sure. 19 For if they were all one member,
where were the body? 20 But now are
there many members, yet but one body.
21 And the eye cannot say vnto the hand,
I haue no neede of thee: nor the head
againe to the feete, I haue no neede of
you. 22 Yea, much rather those members
of the body, which seeme to be more
feeble, are necessarie. 23 And vpon those
members of the body, which wee thinke
most vnhonest, put wee more honestie
on: and our vncomely parts haue more
comelinesse on. 24 For our comely partes
neede it not: but God hath tempered the
body together, and hath giuen the more
honour to that part which lacked, 25 Lest
there should be any diuision in the body:
but that the members shoulde haue the
same care one for another. 26 Therefore
if one member suffer, all suffer with it:
if one member be had in honour, all the
members reioyce with it. 27 Now ye are
the body of Christ, and members for your
part. 28 And God hath ordained some in
the Church: as first Apostles, secondly
Prophetes, thirdly teachers, then them
that doe miracles: after that, the giftes
of healing, helpers, gouernours, diuersitie
of tongues. 29 Are all Apostles? are all
Prophetes? are all teachers? 30 Are all1 Corinthians 12:31
1005
doers of miracles? haue all the gifts of
healing? doe all speake with tongues?
doe all interprete? 31 But desire you the
best giftes, and I will yet shewe you a
more excellent way.
13
1 Though I speake with the tongues of
men and Angels, and haue not loue, I am
as sounding brasse, or a tinkling cymbal.
2 And though I had the gift of prophecie,
and knewe all secrets and all knowledge,
yea, if I had all faith, so that I could
remooue mountaines and had not loue,
I were nothing. 3 And though I feede
the poore with all my goods, and though
I giue my body, that I be burned, and
haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.
4 Loue suffreth long: it is bountifull: loue
enuieth not: loue doeth not boast it selfe:
it is not puffed vp: 5 It doeth no vncomely
thing: it seeketh not her owne things:
it is not prouoked to anger: it thinketh
not euill: 6 It reioyceth not in iniquitie,
but reioyceth in the trueth: 7 It suffreth
all things: it beleeueth all things: it
hopeth all things: it endureth all things.
8 Loue doeth neuer fall away, though that
prophecyings be abolished, or the tongues
cease, or knowledge vanish away. 9 For
we knowe in part, and we prophecie in
part. 10 But when that which is perfect, is
come, then that which is in part, shalbe
abolished. 11 When I was a childe, I spake
as a childe, I vnderstoode as a childe, I
thought as a childe: but when I became a
man, I put away childish thinges. 12 For
nowe we see through a glasse darkely:
but then shall wee see face to face. Nowe I
know in part: but then shall I know euen
as I am knowen. 13 And nowe abideth
faith, hope and loue, euen these three:
but the chiefest of these is loue.
14
1 Followe after loue, and couet spirituall
giftes, and rather that ye may prophecie.
2 For hee that speaketh a strange tongue,
speaketh not vnto men, but vnto God: for
no man heareth him: howbeit in the spirit
he speaketh secret things. 3 But he that
1 Corinthians 14:18
prophecieth, speaketh vnto me to edify-
ing, and to exhortation, and to comfort.
4 He that speaketh strange language, edi-
fieth himselfe: but hee that prophecieth,
edifieth the Church. 5 I would that ye
all spake strange languages, but rather
that ye prophecied: for greater is hee
that prophecieth, then hee that speaketh
diuers tongues, except hee expound it,
that the Church may receiue edification.
6 And nowe, brethren, if I come vnto
you speaking diuers tongues, what shall I
profite you, except I speake to you, either
by reuelation, or by knowledge, or by
prophecying, or by doctrine? 7 Moreouer
things without life which giue a sounde,
whether it be a pipe or an harpe, except
they make a distinction in the soundes,
how shall it be knowen what is piped or
harped? 8 And also if the trumpet giue
an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare
himselfe to battell? 9 So likewise you,
by the tongue, except yee vtter wordes
that haue signification, howe shall it be
vnderstand what is spoken? for ye shall
10 There are so
speake in the ayre.
many kindes of voyces (as it commeth to
passe) in the world, and none of them
is dumme. 11 Except I know then the
power of ye voyce, I shall be vnto him
that speaketh a barbarian, and he that
speaketh, shalbe a barbarian vnto me.
12 Euen so, forasmuch as ye couet spiri-
tuall giftes, seeke that ye may excell vnto
the edifying of the Church. 13 Wherefore,
let him that speaketh a strange tongue,
pray, that he may interprete. 14 For if I
pray in a strange togue, my spirit prayeth:
but mine vnderstading is without fruite.
15 What is it then? I will pray with the
spirit, but I wil pray with the vnderstand-
ing also: I wil sing with the spirite, but
I will sing with the vnderstanding also.
16 Else, when thou blessest with the spirit,
howe shall hee that occupieth the roome
of the vnlearned, say Amen, at thy giuing
of thankes, seeing he knoweth not what
thou sayest? 17 For thou verely giuest
thankes well, but the other is not edified.
18 I thanke my God, I speake languages1 Corinthians 14:19
1006
more then ye all. 19 Yet had I rather
in the Church to speake fiue wordes
with mine vnderstanding, that I might
also instruct others, then ten thousande
wordes in a strange tongue. 20 Brethren,
be not children in vnderstanding, but
as concerning maliciousnes be children,
but in vnderstanding be of a ripe age.
21 In the Lawe it is written, By men of
other tongues, and by other languages
will I speake vnto this people: yet so
shall they not heare me, sayth the Lord.
22 Wherefore strange tongues are for a
signe, not to them that beleeue, but to
them that beleeue not: but prophecying
serueth not for them that beleeue not, but
for them which beleeue. 23 If therefore
when the whole Church is come together
in one, and all speake strange tongues,
there come in they that are vnlearned, or
they which beleeue not, will they not say,
that ye are out of your wittes? 24 But if
all prophecie, and there come in one that
beleeueth not, or one vnlearned, hee is
rebuked of all men, and is iudged of all,
25 And so are the secrets of his heart made
manifest, and so he will fall downe on his
face and worship God, and say plainely
that God is in you in deede. 26 What
is to be done then, brethren? when ye
come together, according as euery one
of you hath a Psalme, or hath doctrine,
or hath a tongue, or hath reuelation, or
hath interpretation, let all things be done
vnto edifying. 27 If any man speake a
strange tongue, let it be by two, or at the
most, by three, and that by course, and
let one interprete. 28 But if there be no
interpreter, let him keepe silence in the
Church, which speaketh languages, and
let him speake to himselfe, and to God.
29 Let the Prophets speake two, or three,
and let the other iudge. 30 And if any
thing be reueiled to another that sitteth
by, let the first holde his peace. 31 For ye
may all prophecie one by one, that all may
learne, and all may haue comfort. 32 And
the spirits of the Prophets are subiect to
the Prophets. 33 For God is not the author
of confusion, but of peace, as we see in
all ye Churches of the Saints. 34 Let your
1 Corinthians 15:12
women keepe silence in the Churches: for
it is not permitted vnto them to speake:
but they ought to be subiect, as also the
Lawe sayth. 35 And if they will learne
any thing, let them aske their husbands
at home: for it is a shame for women to
speake in the Church. 36 Came the worde
of God out from you? either came it vnto
you onely? 37 If any man thinke him
selfe to be a Prophet, or spirituall, let him
acknowledge, that the things, that I write
vnto you, are the commandements of the
Lord. 38 And if any man be ignorant, let
him be ignorant. 39 Wherefore, brethren,
couet to prophecie, and forbid not to
speake languages. 40 Let all things be
done honestly, and by order.
1 Moreouer
15
brethren, I declare vnto
you the Gospel, which I preached vnto
you, which ye haue also receiued, and
wherein ye continue, 2 And whereby ye
are saued, if ye keepe in memorie, after
what maner I preached it vnto you, except
ye haue beleeued in vaine. 3 For first
of all, I deliuered vnto you that which
I receiued, how that Christ died for our
sinnes, according to the Scriptures, 4 And
that he was buried, and that he arose
the third day, according to the Scriptures,
5 And that he was seene of Cephas, then of
the twelue. 6 After that, he was seene of
more then fiue hudreth brethren at once:
whereof many remaine vnto this present,
and some also are asleepe. 7 After that,
he was seene of Iames: then of all the
Apostles. 8 And last of all he was seene
also of me, as of one borne out of due
time. 9 For I am the least of the Apostles,
which am not meete to be called an
Apostle, because I persecuted the Church
of God. 10 But by the grace of God, I
am that I am: and his grace which is
in me, was not in vaine: but I laboured
more aboundantly then they all: yet not
I, but the grace of God which is with me.
11 Wherefore, whether it were I, or they,
so we preach, and so haue ye beleeued.
12 Now if it be preached, that Christ is
risen from the dead, how say some among1 Corinthians 15:13
1007
you, that there is no resurrection of the
dead? 13 For if there be no resurrection of
the dead, then is Christ not risen: 14 And if
Christ be not risen, then is our preaching
vaine, and your faith is also vaine. 15 And
we are found also false witnesses of God:
for we haue testified of God, that he hath
raised vp Christ: whome he hath not
raised vp, if so be the dead be not raised.
16 For if the dead be not raised, then is
Christ not raised. 17 And if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vaine: ye are yet in
your sinnes. 18 And so they which are
a sleepe in Christ, are perished. 19 If in
this life onely wee haue hope in Christ,
we are of all men the most miserable.
20 But nowe is Christ risen from the dead,
and was made the first fruites of them
that slept. 21 For since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die,
euen so in Christ shall all be made aliue,
23 But euery man in his owne order: the
first fruites is Christ, afterward, they that
are of Christ, at his comming shall rise
againe. 24 Then shalbe the end, when he
hath deliuered vp the kingdome to God,
euen the Father, when he hath put downe
all rule, and all authoritie and power.
25 For he must reigne till hee hath put all
his enemies vnder his feete. 26 The last
enemie that shalbe destroyed, is death.
27 For he hath put downe all things vnder
his feete. (And when he saith that all
things are subdued to him, it is manifest
that he is excepted, which did put downe
all things vnder him.) 28 And when all
things shalbe subdued vnto him, then
shall the Sonne also himselfe be subiect
vnto him, that did subdue all things vnder
him, that God may be all in all. 29 Els
what shall they doe which are baptized
for dead? if the dead rise not at all, why
are they then baptized for dead? 30 Why
are wee also in ieopardie euery houre?
31 By your reioycing which I haue in Christ
Iesus our Lord, I die dayly. 32 If I haue
fought with beastes at Ephesus after ye
maner of men, what aduantageth it me,
if the dead be not raised vp? let vs
eate and drinke: for to morowe we shall
die. 33 Be not deceiued: euill speakings
1 Corinthians 15:52
corrupt good maners. 34 Awake to liue
righteously, and sinne not: for some haue
not ye knowledge of God, I speake this to
your shame. 35 But some man will say,
Howe are the dead raised vp? and with
what body come they foorth? 36 O foole,
that which thou sowest, is not quickened,
except it die. 37 And that which thou
sowest, thou sowest not that body that
shalbe, but bare corne as it falleth, of
wheat, or of some other. 38 But God
giueth it a body at his pleasure, euen to
euery seede his owne body, 39 All flesh
is not the same flesh, but there is one
flesh of men, and another flesh of beastes,
and another of fishes, and another of
birdes. 40 There are also heauenly bodies,
and earthly bodies: but the glorie of the
heauenly is one, and the glorie of the
earthly is another. 41 There is another
glorie of the sunne, and another glorie
of the moone, and another glorie of the
starres: for one starre differeth from
another starre in glorie. 42 So also is
the resurrection of the dead. The bodie
is sowen in corruption, and is raysed in
incorruption. 43 It is sowen in dishonour,
and is raysed in glory: it is sowen in
weakenesse, and is raysed in power. 44 It
is sowen a naturall body, and is raysed a
spirituall body: there is a naturall body,
and there is a spirituall body. 45 As it
is also written, The first man Adam was
made a liuing soule: and the last Adam
was made a quickening Spirit. 46 Howbeit
that was not first which is spirituall: but
that which is naturall, and afterward that
which is spirituall. 47 The first man is of
the earth, earthly: the second man is the
Lord from heauen. 48 As is the earthly,
such are they that are earthly: and as is
the heauenly, such are they also that are
heauenly. 49 And as we haue borne the
image of the earthly, so shall we beare
the image of the heauenly. 50 This say
I, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherite the kingdome of God, neither
doeth corruption inherite incorruption.
51 Behold, I shewe you a secret thing, We
shall not all sleepe, but we shall all be
changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinck-1 Corinthians 15:53
1008
ling of an eye at the last trumpet: for the
trumpet shall blow, and the dead shalbe
raysed vp incorruptible, and we shalbe
changed. 53 For this corruptible must
put on incorruption: and this mortall
must put on immortalitie. 54 So when
this corruptible hath put on incorruption,
and this mortall hath put on immortalitie,
then shalbe brought to passe the saying
that is written, Death is swallowed vp
into victorie. 55 O death where is thy
sting? O graue where is thy victorie?
56 The sting of death is sinne: and ye
strength of sinne is the Lawe. 57 But
thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen
vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.
58 Therefore my beloued brethren, be ye
stedfast, vnmoueable, aboundant alwayes
in the worke of the Lord, forasmuch as ye
knowe that your labour is not in vaine in
the Lord.
16
Concerning the gathering for the
Saintes, as I haue ordeined in the
Churches of Galatia, so doe ye also.
2 Euery first day of the weeke, let euery
one of you put aside by himselfe, and
lay vp as God hath prospered him, that
then there be no gatherings when I come.
3 And when I am come, whomsoeuer ye
shall alowe by letters, them will I send
to bring your liberalitie vnto Hierusalem.
4 And if it be meete that I goe also,
they shall goe with me. 5 Nowe I will
come vnto you, after I haue gone through
Macedonia (for I will passe through Mace-
donia.) 6 And it may be that I will abide,
yea, or winter with you, that ye may bring
me on my way, whither soeuer I goe. 7 For
I will not see you nowe in my passage,
but I trust to abide a while with you,
if the Lord permit. 8 And I wil tary at
Ephesus vntill Pentecost. 9 For a great
doore and effectuall is opened vnto me:
and there are many aduersaries. 10 Nowe
if Timotheus come, see that he be without
feare with you: for he worketh the worke
of the Lord, euen as I doe. 11 Let no man
therefore despise him: but conuey him
foorth in peace, that he may come vnto
1
1 Corinthians 16:24
me: for I looke for him with the brethren.
12 As touching our brother Apollos, I
greatly desired him, to come vnto you
with the brethren: but his mind was not
at all to come at this time: howbeit he
will come when he shall haue conuenient
time. 13 Watch ye: stand fast in the faith:
quite you like men, and be strong. 14 Let
all your things be done in loue. 15 Nowe
brethren, I beseeche you (ye knowe the
house of Stephanas, that it is the first
fruites of Achaia, and that they haue
giuen themselues to minister vnto the
Saintes) 16 That ye be obedient euen vnto
such, and to all that helpe with vs and
labour. 17 I am glad of the comming of
Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus:
for they haue supplied the want of you.
18 For they haue comforted my spirite
and yours: acknowledge therefore such
men. 19 The Churches of Asia salute
you: Aquila and Priscilla with ye Church
that is in their house, salute you greatly
in the Lord. 20 All the brethren greete
you. Greete ye one another, with an
holy kisse. 21 The salutation of me Paul
with mine owne hand. 22 If any man
loue not the Lord Iesus Christ, let him
be had in execration maran-atha. 23 The
grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with
you. 24 My loue be with you all in Christ
Iesus, Amen. ‘The first Epistle to the
Corinthians, written from Philippi, and
sent by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and
Achaicus, and Timotheus.’2 Corinthians 1:1

THE SECOND EPISTLE
OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
TO THE CORINTHIANS
1 Pavl
an Apostle of JESVS Christ, by
the will of God, and our brother Tim-
otheus, to the Church of God, which is
at Corinthus with all the Saints, which
are in all Achaia: 2 Grace be with you,
and peace from God our Father, and
from the Lord Iesus Christ. 3 Blessed be
God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, the Father of mercies, and the
God of all comfort, 4 Which comforteth
vs in all our tribulation, that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any
affliction by the comfort wherewith we
our selues are comforted of God. 5 For
as the sufferings of Christ abounde in
vs, so our consolation aboundeth through
Christ. 6 And whether we be afflicted,
it is for your consolation and saluation,
which is wrought in the induring of the
same sufferings, which we also suffer: or
whether we be comforted, it is for your
consolation and saluation. 7 And our hope
is stedfast concerning you, in as much as
we know that as ye are partakers of the
sufferings, so shall ye be also of the con-
solation. 8 For brethren, we woulde not
haue you ignorant of our affliction, which
came vnto vs in Asia, howe we were
pressed out of measure passing strength,
so that we altogether doubted, euen of
life. 9 Yea, we receiued the sentence of
death in our selues, because we shoulde
not trust in our selues, but in God, which
rayseth the dead. 10 Who deliuered vs
from so great a death, and doeth deliuer
vs: in whom we trust, that yet hereafter
he will deliuer vs, 11 So that ye labour
together in prayer for vs, that for the gift
bestowed vpon vs for many, thankes may
be giuen by many persons for vs. 12 For
our reioycing is this, the testimonie of our
conscience, that in simplicitie and godly
purenesse, and not in fleshly wisedome,
but by the grace of God wee haue had our
conuersation in the worlde, and most of
2 Corinthians 2:4
all to you wardes. 13 For wee write none
other thinges vnto you, then that ye reade
or els that ye acknowledge, and I trust ye
shall acknowledge vnto ye end. 14 Euen
as ye haue acknowledged vs partly, that
we are your reioycing, euen as ye are
ours, in the day of our Lord Iesus. 15 And
in this confidence was I minded first to
come vnto you, that ye might haue had
a double grace, 16 And to passe by you
into Macedonia, and to come againe out
of Macedonia vnto you, and to be led
foorth towarde Iudea of you. 17 When
I therefore was thus minded, did I vse
lightnesse? or minde I those thinges
which I minde, according to the flesh, that
with me should be, Yea, yea, and Nay,
nay? 18 Yea, God is faithfull, that our
worde towarde you was not Yea, and Nay.
19 For the Sonne of God Iesus Christ, who
was preached among you by vs, that is,
by me, and Siluanus, and Timotheus, was
not Yea, and Nay: but in him it was Yea.
20 For all the promises of God in him are
Yea, and are in him Amen, vnto the glorie
of God through vs. 21 And it is God which
stablisheth vs with you in Christ, and hath
anoynted vs. 22 Who hath also sealed vs,
and hath giuen the earnest of the Spirit
in our hearts. 23 Nowe, I call God for a
recorde vnto my soule, that to spare you,
I came not as yet vnto Corinthus. 24 Not
that wee haue dominion ouer your faith,
but wee are helpers of your ioy: for by
faith yee stande.
2
1 Bvt I determined thus in my selfe, that
I would not come againe to you in heaui-
nesse. 2 For if I make you sorie, who is he
then that shoulde make me glad, but ye
same which is made sorie by me? 3 And I
wrote this same thing vnto you, lest when
I came, I should take heauines of them, of
whom I ought to reioyce: this confidence
haue I in you all, that my ioye is the
ioye of you all. 4 For in great affliction,
and anguish of heart I wrote vnto you
with many teares: not that yee should be
made sorie, but that ye might perceiue
the loue which I haue, specially vnto2 Corinthians 2:5
1010
you. 5 And if any hath caused sorowe,
the same hath not made mee sorie, but
partly (lest I should more charge him)
you all. 6 It is sufficient vnto the same
man, that hee was rebuked of many.
7 So that nowe contrariwise yee ought
rather to forgiue him, and comfort him,
lest the same shoulde bee swalowed vp
with ouermuch heauinesse. 8 Wherefore,
I pray you, that you woulde confirme
your loue towards him. 9 For this cause
also did I write, that I might knowe the
proofe of you, whether yee would be
obedient in all things. 10 To whome yee
forgiue any thing, I forgiue also: for
verely if I forgaue any thing, to whome I
forgaue it, for your sakes forgaue I it in
the sight of Christ, 11 Lest Satan should
circumuent vs: for we are not ignorant
of his enterprises. 12 Furthermore, when
I came to Troas to preach Christs Gospell,
and a doore was opened vnto me of the
Lord, 13 I had no rest in my spirit, because
I founde not Titus my brother, but tooke
my leaue of them, and went away into
Macedonia. 14 Now thankes be vnto God,
which alwaies maketh vs to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the sauour
of his knowledge by vs in euery place.
15 For wee are vnto God the sweete sauour
of Christ, in them that are saued, and
in them which perish. 16 To the one we
are the sauour of death, vnto death, and
to the other the sauour of life, vnto life:
and who is sufficient for these things?
17 For wee are not as many, which make
marchandise of the woorde of God: but
as of sinceritie, but as of God in ye sight
of God speake we in Christ.
2 Corinthians 4:2
but in fleshly tables of the heart. 4 And
such trust haue we through Christ to
God: 5 Not that we are sufficient of our
selues, to thinke any thing, as of our
selues: but our sufficiencie is of God,
6 Who also hath made vs able ministers
of the Newe testament, not of the letter,
but of the Spirite: for the letter killeth,
but the Spirite giueth life. 7 If then the
ministration of death written with letters
and ingrauen in stones, was glorious, so
that the children of Israel coulde not
beholde the face of Moses, for the glorie
of his countenance (which glorie is done
away.) 8 Howe shall not the ministration
of the Spirite be more glorious? 9 For if
the ministerie of condemnation was glo-
rious, much more doeth the ministration
of righteousnesse exceede in glorie. 10 For
euen that which was glorified, was not
glorified in this point, that is, as touching
the exceeding glorie. 11 For if that which
should be abolished, was glorious, much
more shall that which remaineth, be
glorious. 12 Seeing then that we haue such
trust, we vse great boldnesse of speach.
13 And we are not as Moses, which put a
vaile vpon his face, that the children of Is-
rael should not looke vnto the ende of that
which should be abolished. 14 Therefore
their mindes are hardened: for vntill
this day remaineth the same couering
vntaken away in the reading of the olde
Testament, which vaile in Christ is put
away. 15 But euen vnto this day, whe
Moses is read, the vaile is laid ouer their
hearts. 16 Neuertheles when their heart
shall be turned to the Lord, the vaile
shalbe taken away. 17 Nowe the Lord is
the Spirite, and where the Spirite of the
Lord is, there is libertie. 18 But we al
behold as in a mirrour the glory of the
3
1 Doe we begin to praise our selues Lord with open face, and are changed into
againe? or neede we as some other, the same image, from glorie to glorie, as
epistles of recommendation vnto you, by the Spirit of the Lord.
or letters of recommendation from you?
2 Yee are our epistle, written in our hearts,
4
1 Therefore, seeing that we haue this
which is vnderstand, and read of all men,
3 In that yee are manifest, to be the Epistle
ministerie, as we haue receiued mercy,
of Christ, ministred by vs, and written, we faint not: 2 But haue cast from vs
not with yncke, but with the Spirite of ye clokes of shame, and walke not in
the liuing God, not in tables of stone, craftines, neither handle we the worde2 Corinthians 4:3
1011
of God deceitfully: but in declaration of
the trueth we approue our selues to euery
mans conscience in the sight of God. 3 If
our Gospell bee then hid, it is hid to them
that are lost. 4 In whom the God of this
world hath blinded the mindes, that is, of
the infidels, that the light of the glorious
Gospell of Christ, which is the image of
God, should not shine vnto them. 5 For
we preach not our selues, but Christ Iesus
the Lord, and our selues your seruaunts
for Iesus sake. 6 For God that commanded
the light to shine out of darknesse, is he
which hath shined in our hearts, to giue
the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Iesus Christ. 7 But
we haue this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the excellencie of that power might
be of God, and not of vs. 8 Wee are
afflicted on euery side, yet are we not in
distresse: we are in doubt, but yet wee
despaire not. 9 We are persecuted, but
not forsaken: cast downe, but we perish
not. 10 Euery where we beare about in
our bodie the dying of the Lord Iesus,
that the life of Iesus might also be made
manifest in our bodies. 11 For we which
liue, are alwaies deliuered vnto death for
Iesus sake, that the life also of Iesus might
be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
12 So then death worketh in vs, and life
in you. 13 And because we haue the same
spirite of faith, according as it is written,
I beleeued, and therefore haue I spoken,
we also beleeue, and therefore speake,
14 Knowing that he which hath raised vp
the Lord Iesus, shall raise vs vp also by
Iesus, and shall set vs with you. 15 For all
thinges are for your sakes, that that most
plenteous grace by the thankesgiuing of
many, may redound to the praise of God.
16 Therefore we faint not, but though our
outward man perish, yet the inward man
is renewed daily. 17 For our light affliction
which is but for a moment, causeth vnto
vs a farre most excellent and an eternall
waight of glorie: 18 While we looke not on
the thinges which are seene, but on the
things which are not seene: for the things
which are seene, are temporall: but the
things which are not seene, are eternall.
2 Corinthians 5:16
5
1 For we knowe that if our earthly house
of this tabernacle be destroyed, we haue
a building giuen of God, that is, an house
not made with handes, but eternall in
the heauens. 2 For therefore we sighe,
desiring to be clothed with our house,
which is from heauen. 3 Because that
if we be clothed, we shall not be found
naked. 4 For in deede we that are in
this tabernacle, sigh and are burdened,
because we would not be vnclothed, but
would be clothed vpon, that mortalitie
might be swalowed vp of life. 5 And he
that hath created vs for this thing, is God,
who also hath giuen vnto vs the earnest
of the Spirit. 6 Therefore we are alway
bolde, though we knowe that whiles we
are at home in the bodie, we are absent
from the Lord. 7 (For we walke by faith,
and not by sight.) 8 Neuerthelesse, we
are bolde, and loue rather to remoue
out of the body, and to dwell with the
Lord. 9 Wherefore also we couet, that
both dwelling at home, and remouing
from home, we may be acceptable to
him. 10 For we must all appeare before
the iudgement seate of Christ, that euery
man may receiue the things which are
done in his body, according to that he
hath done, whether it be good or euill.
11 Knowing therefore that terrour of the
Lord, we persuade men, and we are made
manifest vnto God, and I trust also that we
are made manifest in your consciences.
12 For we prayse not our selues againe
vnto you, but giue you an occasion to
reioyce of vs, that ye may haue to answere
against them, which reioyce in the face,
and not in the heart. 13 For whether we
be out of our wit, we are it to God: or
whether we be in our right minde, we
are it vnto you. 14 For that loue of Christ
constraineth vs, 15 Because we thus iudge,
that if one be dead for all, then were
all dead, and he died for all, that they
which liue, shoulde not henceforth liue
vnto themselues, but vnto him which died
for them, and rose againe. 16 Wherefore,
henceforth know we no man after the
flesh, yea though wee had knowen Christ
after the flesh, yet nowe henceforth know2 Corinthians 5:17
1012
we him no more. 17 Therefore if any man
be in Christ, let him be a newe creature.
Olde things are passed away: beholde, all
things are become newe. 18 And all things
are of God, which hath reconciled vs vnto
himselfe by Iesus Christ, and hath giuen
vnto vs the ministerie of reconciliation.
19 For God was in Christ, and reconciled
the world to himselfe, not imputing their
sinnes vnto them, and hath committed
to vs the word of reconciliation. 20 Now
then are we ambassadours for Christ: as
though God did beseeche you through vs,
we pray you in Christes steade, that ye
be reconciled to God. 21 For he hath
made him to be sinne for vs, which knewe
no sinne, that we should be made the
righteousnesse of God in him.
6
1 So we therefore as workers together
beseech you, that ye receiue not the grace
of God in vaine. 2 For he sayth, I haue
heard thee in a time accepted, and in the
day of saluation haue I succoured thee:
beholde nowe the accepted time, beholde
nowe the day of saluation. 3 We giue no
occasion of offence in any thing, that our
ministerie shoulde not be reprehended.
4 But in all things we approue our selues
as the ministers of God, in much patience,
in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
5 In stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in
labours, 6 By watchings, by fastings, by
puritie, by knowledge, by long suffering,
by kindnesse, by the holy Ghost, by loue
vnfained, 7 By the worde of trueth, by
the power of God, by the armour of righ-
teousnesse on the right hand, and on the
left, 8 By honour, and dishonour, by euill
report, and good report, as deceiuers,
and yet true: 9 As vnknowen, and yet
knowen: as dying, and beholde, we liue:
as chastened, and yet not killed: 10 As
sorowing, and yet alway reioycing: as
poore, and yet make many riche: as
hauing nothing, and yet possessing all
things. 11 O Corinthians, our mouth is
open vnto you: our heart is made large.
12 Ye are not kept strait in vs, but ye are
kept strait in your owne bowels. 13 Nowe
2 Corinthians 7:9
for the same recompence, I speake as to
my children, Be you also inlarged. 14 Be
not vnequally yoked with the infidels: for
what fellowship hath righteousnesse with
vnrighteousnesse? and what communion
hath light with darkenesse? 15 And what
concord hath Christ with Belial? or what
part hath the beleeuer with the infidell?
16 And what agreement hath the Temple
of God with idols? for ye are the Temple
of the liuing God: as God hath said, I
will dwell among them, and walke there:
and I will be their God, and they shalbe
my people. 17 Wherefore come out from
among them, and separate your selues,
saith the Lord, and touch none vncleane
thing, and I wil receiue you. 18 And I
will be a Father vnto you, and ye shalbe
my sonnes and daughters, saith the Lord
almightie.
7
1 Seing then we haue these promises,
dearely beloued, let vs clense our selues
from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit,
and finish our sanctification in the feare
of God. 2 Receiue vs: we haue done
wrong to no man: we haue corrupted no
man: we haue defrauded no man. 3 I
speake it not to your condemnation: for
I haue said before, that ye are in our
hearts, to die and liue together. 4 I vse
great boldnesse of speach toward you: I
reioyce greatly in you: I am filled with
comfort, and am exceeding ioyous in all
our tribulation. 5 For when we were
come into Macedonia, our flesh had no
rest, but we were troubled on euery side,
fightings without, and terrours within.
6 But God, that comforteth the abiect,
comforted vs at the comming of Titus:
7 And not by his comming onely, but
also by the consolation wherewith he was
comforted of you, when he tolde vs your
great desire, your mourning, your feruent
minde to me warde, so that I reioyced
much more. 8 For though I made you
sorie with a letter, I repent not, though I
did repent: for I perceiue that the same
epistle made you sorie, though it were
but for a season. 9 I nowe reioyce, not2 Corinthians 7:10
1013
that ye were sorie, but that ye sorowed
to repentance: for ye sorowed godly,
so that in nothing ye were hurt by vs.
10 For godly sorowe causeth repentance
vnto saluation, not to be repented of:
but the worldly sorowe causeth death.
11 For beholde, this thing that ye haue
bene godly sory, what great care it hath
wrought in you: yea, what clearing of
yourselues: yea, what indignation: yea,
what feare: yea, howe great desire: yea,
what a zeale: yea, what reuenge: in all
things ye haue shewed your selues, that
ye are pure in this matter. 12 Wherefore,
though I wrote vnto you, I did not it for his
cause that had done the wrong, neither
for his cause that had the iniurie, but
that our care toward you in the sight of
God might appeare vnto you. 13 Therefore
we were comforted, because ye were
comforted: but rather we reioyced much
more for the ioye of Titus, because his
spirit was refreshed by you all. 14 For
if that I haue boasted any thing to him
of you, I haue not bene ashamed: but
as I haue spoken vnto you all things in
trueth, euen so our boasting vnto Titus
was true. 15 And his inwarde affection
is more aboundant toward you, when
he remembreth the obedience of you all,
and howe with feare and trembling ye
receiued him. 16 I reioyce therefore that
I may put my confidence in you in all
things.
1 We
8
doe you also to wit, brethren,
of the grace of God bestowed vpon the
Churches of Macedonia, 2 Because in great
triall of affliction their ioy abounded, and
their most extreme pouertie abounded
vnto their rich liberalitie. 3 For to their
power (I beare record) yea, and beyonde
their power, they were willing, 4 And
praied vs with great instance that we
woulde receiue the grace, and fellowship
of the ministring which is toward the
Saints. 5 And this they did, not as we
looked for: but gaue their owne selues,
first to the Lord, and after vnto vs by
the will of God, 6 That we should exhort
2 Corinthians 8:22
Titus, that as hee had begon, so he would
also accomplish the same grace among
you also. 7 Therefore, as yee abound in
euery thing, in faith and woorde, and
knowledge, and in all diligence, and in
your loue towardes vs, euen so see that
yee abound in this grace also. 8 This say
I not by commandement, but because of
the diligence of others: therefore prooue
I the naturalnesse of your loue. 9 For ye
knowe the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,
that hee being rich, for your sakes be-
came poore, that yee through his pouertie
might be made rich. 10 And I shewe my
minde herein: for this is expedient for
you, which haue begun not to doe onely,
but also to will, a yeare agoe. 11 Nowe
therefore performe to doe it also, that as
there was a readinesse to will, euen so
yee may performe it of that which yee
haue. 12 For if there be first a willing
minde, it is accepted according to that
a man hath, and not according to that
he hath not. 13 Neither is it that other
men should be eased and you grieued:
But vpon like condition, at this time your
abundance supplieth their lacke: 14 That
also their aboundance may bee for your
lacke, that there may be equalitie: 15 As
it is written, Hee that gathered much,
had nothing ouer, and hee that gathered
litle, had not the lesse. 16 And thanks be
vnto God, which hath put in the heart of
Titus the same care for you. 17 Because
hee accepted the exhortation, yea, hee
was so carefull that of his owne accorde
hee went vnto you. 18 And wee haue
sent also with him the brother, whose
praise is in the Gospel throughout al the
Churches. 19 (And not so onely, but is also
chosen of the Churches to be a fellowe
in our iourney, concerning this grace
that is ministred by vs vnto the glorie of
the same Lord, and declaration of your
prompt minde) 20 Auoiding this, that no
man shoulde blame vs in this aboundance
that is ministred by vs, 21 Prouiding for
honest thinges, not onely before the Lord,
but also before men. 22 And we haue sent
with them our brother, whom we haue
oft times prooued to be diligent in many2 Corinthians 8:23
1014
thinges, but nowe much more diligent, for
the great confidence, which I haue in you.
23 Whether any doe inquire of Titus, he
is my fellowe and helper to you ward:
or of our brethren, they are messengers
of the Churches, and the glorie of Christ.
24 Wherefore shew toward them, and
before the Churches the proofe of your
loue, and of the reioycing that we haue
of you.
9
1 For as touching the ministring to the
Saints, it is superfluous for me to write
vnto you. 2 For I knowe your readinesse
of minde, whereof I boast my selfe of
you vnto them of Macedonia, and say,
that Achaia was prepared a yeere agoe,
and your zeale hath prouoked many.
3 Nowe haue I sent the brethren, lest our
reioycing ouer you shoulde bee in vaine
in this behalfe, that yee (as I haue sayde)
be readie: 4 Lest if they of Macedonia
come with me, and finde you vnprepared,
we (that wee may not say, you) should
be ashamed in this my constant boast-
ing. 5 Wherefore, I thought it necessarie
to exhort the brethren to come before
vnto you, and to finish your beneuolence
appointed afore, that it might be readie,
and come as of beneuolence, and not as
of niggardlinesse. 6 This yet remember,
that he which soweth sparingly, shall
reape also sparingly, and hee that soweth
liberally, shall reape also liberally. 7 As
euery man wisheth in his heart, so let
him giue, not grudgingly, or of necessitie:
for God loueth a cheerefull giuer. 8 And
God is able to make all grace to abound
towarde you, that yee alwayes hauing all
sufficiencie in all thinges, may abounde
in euery good worke, 9 (As it is written,
He hath sparsed abroad and hath giuen
to the poore: his beneuolence remayneth
for euer. 10 Also hee that findeth seede
to the sower, will minister likewise bread
for foode, and multiplie your seede, and
increase the fruites of your beneuolence,)
11 That on all partes yee may bee made
rich vnto all liberalitie, which causeth
through vs thankesgiuing vnto God. 12 For
2 Corinthians 10:11
the ministration of this seruice not onely
supplieth the necessities of the Saintes,
but also aboundantly causeth many to
giue thankes to God, 13 (Which by the
experiment of this ministration praise
God for your voluntarie submission to the
Gospell of Christ, and for your liberall
distribution to them, and to all men)
14 And in their praier for you, to log after
you greatly, for the aboundant grace of
God in you. 15 Thankes therefore bee vnto
God for his vnspeakeable gift.
10
1 Nowe I Paul my selfe beseech you by
the meekenes, and gentlenes of Christ,
which when I am present among you am
base, but am bolde toward you being ab-
sent: 2 And this I require you, that I neede
not to be bolde when I am present, with
that same confidence, wherewith I thinke
to bee bolde against some, which esteeme
vs as though wee walked according to the
flesh. 3 Neuerthelesse, though wee walke
in the flesh, yet we doe not warre after the
flesh. 4 (For the weapons of our warrefare
are not carnall, but mightie through God,
to cast downe holdes) 5 Casting downe
the imaginations, and euery high thing
that is exalted against the knowledge of
God, and bringing into captiuitie euery
thought to the obedience of Christ, 6 And
hauing ready the vengeance against all
disobedience, when your obedience is
fulfilled. 7 Looke yee on things after the
appearance? If any man trust in himselfe
that hee is Christes, let him consider this
againe of himself, that as he is Christes,
euen so are we Christes. 8 For though
I shoulde boast somewhat more of our
authoritie, which the Lord hath giuen vs
for edification, and not for your destruc-
tion, I should haue no shame. 9 This I
say, that I may not seeme as it were to
feare you with letters. 10 For the letters,
sayeth hee, are sore and strong, but his
bodily presence is weake, and his speache
is of no value. 11 Let such one thinke
this, that such as wee are in woorde by
letters, when we are absent, such wil we
be also in deede, when we are present.2 Corinthians 10:12
1015
12 For wee dare not make our selues of
the nomber, or to compare our selues
to them, which praise themselues: but
they vnderstand not that they measure
themselues with themselues, and com-
pare themselues with themselues. 13 But
we wil not reioyce of things, which are
not within our measure, but according to
the measure of the line, whereof God hath
distributed vnto vs a measure to attaine
euen vnto you. 14 For we stretche not our
selues beyonde our measure, as though
wee had not attained vnto you: for euen
to you also haue we come in preaching
the Gospel of Christ, 15 Not boasting of
things which are without our measure:
that is, of other mens labours: and we
hope, when your faith shall increase,
to bee magnified by you according to
our line aboundantly, 16 And to preache
the Gospel in those regions which are
beyonde you: not to reioyce in another
mans line, that is, in the thinges that are
prepared alreadie. 17 But let him that
reioyceth, reioyce in the Lord. 18 For hee
that praiseth himselfe, is not alowed, but
he whome the Lord praiseth.
11
1 Woulde to God,
yee coulde suffer a
litle my foolishnes, and in deede, ye suffer
me. 2 For I am ielous ouer you, with godly
ielousie: for I haue prepared you for one
husband, to present you as a pure virgine
to Christ: 3 But I feare least as the serpent
beguiled Eue through his subtiltie, so
your mindes shoulde be corrupt from the
simplicitie that is in Christ. 4 For if he
that commeth, preacheth another Iesus
whome we haue not preached: or if yee
receiue another spirite whome ye haue
not receiued: either another Gospell,
which yee haue not receiued, ye might
well haue suffered him. 5 Verely I suppose
that I was not inferior to the very chiefe
Apostles. 6 And though I be rude in
speaking, yet I am not so in knowledge,
but among you wee haue beene made
manifest to the vttermost, in all things.
7 Haue I committed an offence, because I
abased my selfe, that ye might be exalted,
2 Corinthians 11:25
and because I preached to you ye Gospell
of God freely? 8 I robbed other Churches,
and tooke wages of them to doe you
seruice. 9 And when I was present with
you, and had neede, I was not slouthfull
to the hinderance of any man: for that
which was lacking vnto me, the brethre
which came from Macedonia, supplied,
and in all thinges I kept and will keepe my
selfe, that I should not be grieuous to you.
10 The trueth of Christ is in me, that this
reioycing shall not be shut vp against me
in the regions of Achaia. 11 Wherefore?
because I loue you not? God knoweth.
12 But what I doe, that will I doe: that I
may cut away occasion from them which
desire occasion, that they might be found
like vnto vs in that wherein they reioyce.
13 For such false apostles are deceitfull
workers, and transforme themselues into
the Apostles of Christ. 14 And no marueile:
for Satan himselfe is transformed into an
Angel of light. 15 Therefore it is no great
thing, though his ministers transforme
themselues, as though they were the min-
isters of righteousnes, whose end shall be
according to their workes. 16 I say againe,
Let no man thinke that I am foolish, or els
take mee euen as a foole, that I also may
boast my selfe a litle. 17 That I speake,
I speake it not after the Lord: but as it
were foolishly, in this my great boasting.
18 Seeing that many reioyce after the flesh,
I will reioyce also. 19 For ye suffer fooles
gladly, because that yee are wise. 20 For
ye suffer, euen if a man bring you into
bondage, if a man deuoure you, if a man
take your goods, if a man exalt himselfe,
if a man smite you on the face. 21 I speake
as concerning the reproche: as though
that we had bene weake: but wherein
any man is bold (I speake foolishly) I am
bold also. 22 They are Hebrues, so am I:
they are Israelites, so am I: they are the
seede of Abraham, so am I: 23 They are
the ministers of Christ (I speake as a foole)
I am more: in labours more aboundant:
in stripes aboue measure: in prison more
24 Of the
plenteously: in death oft.
Iewes fiue times receiued I fourtie stripes
saue one. 25 I was thrise beaten with2 Corinthians 11:26
1016
roddes: I was once stoned: I suffered
thrise shipwracke: night and day haue I
bene in the deepe sea. 26 In iourneying
I was often, in perils of waters, in perils
of robbers, in perils of mine owne nation,
in perils among the Gentiles, in perils in
the citie, in perils in wildernes, in perils
in the sea, in perils among false brethren,
27 In wearinesse and painefulnesse, in
watching often, in hunger and thirst, in
fastings often, in colde and in nakednesse.
28 Beside the thinges which are outwarde,
I am combred dayly, and haue the care
of all the Churches. 29 Who is weake, and
I am not weake? who is offended, and
I burne not? 30 If I must needes reioyce,
I will reioyce of mine infirmities. 31 The
God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, which is blessed for euermore,
knoweth that I lie not. 32 In Damascus
the gouernour of the people vnder King
Aretas, layde watch in the citie of the
Damascens, and would haue caught me.
33 But at a window was I let downe in a
basket through the wall, and escaped his
handes.
12
1 It is not expedient for me no doubt
to reioyce: for I will come to visions and
reuelations of the Lord. 2 I know a man
in Christ aboue fourteene yeeres agone,
(whether he were in the body, I can not
tell, or out of the body, I can not tell: God
knoweth) which was taken vp into the
thirde heauen. 3 And I knowe such a man
(whether in the body, or out of the body,
I can not tell: God knoweth) 4 How that
he was taken vp into Paradise, and heard
words which cannot be spoken, which
are not possible for man to vtter. 5 Of
such a man will I reioyce: of my selfe
will I not reioyce, except it bee of mine
infirmities. 6 For though I woulde reioyce,
I should not be a foole, for I will say
the trueth: but I refraine, lest any man
should thinke of me aboue that hee seeth
in me, or that he heareth of me. 7 And
lest I should be exalted out of measure
through the aboundance of reuelations,
there was giuen vnto me a pricke in the
flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet
2 Corinthians 12:20
mee, because I should not be exalted out
of measure. 8 For this thing I besought
the Lord thrise, that it might depart from
me. 9 And he said vnto me, My grace is
sufficient for thee: for my power is made
perfect through weakenesse. Very gladly
therefore will I reioyce rather in mine
infirmities, that the power of Christ may
dwell in me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure
in infirmities, in reproches, in necessities,
in persecutions, in anguish for Christes
sake: for when I am weake, then am I
strong. 11 I was a foole to boast my selfe:
yee haue compelled mee: for I ought
to haue bene commended of you: for
in nothing was I inferiour vnto the very
chiefe Apostles, though I bee nothing.
12 The signes of an Apostle were wrought
among you with all patience, with signes,
and wonders, and great workes. 13 For
what is it, wherein yee were inferiours
vnto other Churches, except that I haue
not bene slouthfull to your hinderance?
forgiue me this wrong. 14 Behold, the
thirde time I am ready to come vnto you,
and yet will I not be slouthfull to your
hinderance: for I seeke not yours, but
you: for the children ought not to laye
vp for the fathers, but the fathers for
the children. 15 And I will most gladly
bestow, and will be bestowed for your
soules: though the more I loue you, the
lesse I am loued. 16 But bee it that I
charged you not: yet for as much as I
was craftie, I tooke you with guile. 17 Did
I pill you by any of them whom I sent
vnto you? 18 I haue desired Titus, and
with him I haue sent a brother: did Titus
pill you of any thing? walked we not
in the selfe same spirit? walked we not
in the same steppes? 19 Againe, thinke
yee that wee excuse our selues vnto you?
we speake before God in Christ. But
wee doe all thinges, dearely beloued, for
your edifying. 20 For I feare least when
I come, I shall not finde you such as I
would: and that I shalbe found vnto you
such as ye woulde not, and least there
be strife, enuying, wrath, contentions,
backebitings, whisperings, swellings and2 Corinthians 12:21
1017
discord. 21 I feare least when I come
againe, my God abase me among you, and
I shall bewaile many of them which haue
sinned already, and haue not repented
of the vncleannesse, and fornication, and
wantonnesse which they haue commit-
ted.
13
1 Lo this is the thirde time that I come
vnto you. In the mouth of two or three
witnesses shall euery worde stand 2 I
tolde you before, and tell you before: as
though I had bene present the seconde
time, so write I nowe being absent to
them which heretofore haue sinned and
to all others, that if I come againe, I
will not spare, 3 Seeing that ye seeke
experience of Christ, that speaketh in
mee, which towarde you is not weake,
but is mightie in you. 4 For though hee
was crucified concerning his infirmitie,
yet liueth hee through the power of God.
And wee no doubt are weake in him, but
we shall liue with him, through the power
of God towarde you. 5 Proue your selues
whether ye are in the faith: examine your
selues: knowe yee not your owne selues,
howe that Iesus Christ is in you, except
ye be reprobates? 6 But I trust that ye
shall knowe that wee are not reprobates.
7 Nowe I pray vnto God that yee doe none
euill, not that we should seeme approued,
but that ye should doe that which is
honest: though we be as reprobates. 8 For
wee can not doe any thing against the
trueth, but for the trueth. 9 For we are
glad when wee are weake, and that ye
are strong: this also we wish for, euen
your perfection. 10 Therefore write I
these thinges being absent, least when
I am present, I should vse sharpenesse,
according to the power which the Lord
hath giuen mee, to edification, and not
to destruction. 11 Finally brethren, fare
ye well: be perfect: be of good comfort:
be of one minde: liue in peace, and the
God of loue and peace shalbe with you.
12 Greete one another with an holy kisse.
All the Saintes salute you. 13 The grace of
our Lord Iesus Christ, and the loue of God,
2 Corinthians 13:13
and the communion of the holy Ghost be
with you all, Amen. ‘The seconde Epistle

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
THE APOSTLE TO THE
GALATIANS
1 Pavl an Apostle (not of men, neither
by man, but by Iesus Christ, and God the
Father which hath raised him from the
dead) 2 And all the brethren which are
with me, vnto the Churches of Galatia:
3 Grace be with you, and peace from
God the Father, and from our Lord Iesus
Christ, 4 Which gaue himself for our
sinnes, that he might deliuer vs from
this present euill world according to the
will of God euen our Father, 5 To whom
be glory for euer and euer, Amen. 6 I
marueile that ye are so soone remoued
away vnto another Gospel, from him that
had called you in the grace of Christ,
7 Which is not another Gospel, saue that
there be some which trouble you, and
intend to peruert the Gospel of Christ.
8 But though that we, or an Angel from
heauen preach vnto you otherwise, then
that which we haue preached vnto you,
let him be accursed. 9 As we sayd before,
so say I now againe, If any man preach
vnto you otherwise, then that ye haue
receiued, let him be accursed. 10 For nowe
preach I mans doctrine, or Gods? or go
I about to please men? for if I should
yet please men, I were not the seruant
of Christ. 11 Now I certifie you, brethren,
that ye Gospel which was preached of me,
was not after man. 12 For neither receiued
I it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
the reuelation of Iesus Christ. 13 For ye
haue heard of my conuersation in time
past, in the Iewish religion, how that I per-
secuted the Church of God extremely, and
wasted it, 14 And profited in the Iewish
religion aboue many of my companions of
mine owne nation, and was much more
zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
15 But when it pleased God (which had
separated me from my mothers wombe,
and called me by his grace) 16 To reueile
his Sonne in me, that I should preach
him among the Gentiles, immediatly I
Galatians 2:8
communicated not with flesh and blood:
17 Neither came I againe to Hierusalem
to them which were Apostles before me,
but I went into Arabia, and turned againe
18 Then after three
vnto Damascus.
yeeres I came againe to Hierusalem to
visite Peter, and abode with him fifteene
dayes. 19 And none other of the Apostles
sawe I, saue Iames the Lords brother.
20 Nowe the things which I write vnto you,
beholde, I witnes before God, that I lie
not. 21 After that, I went into the coastes
of Syria and Cilicia: for I was vnknowen
by face vnto the Churches of Iudea, which
were in Christ. 22 But they had heard
onely some say, Hee which persecuted vs
in time past, nowe preacheth the faith
which before he destroyed. 23 And they
glorified God for me.
1 Then
2
fourteene yeeres after, I went
vp againe to Hierusalem with Barnabas,
and tooke with me Titus also. 2 And
I went vp by reuelation, and declared
vnto them that Gospel which I preach
among the Gentiles, but particularly to
them that were the chiefe, least by any
meanes I should runne, or had runne
in vaine: 3 But neither yet Titus which
was with me, though he were a Grecian,
was compelled to be circumcised, 4 To
wit, for the false brethren which were
craftily sent in, and crept in priuily to
spie out our libertie, which we haue in
Christ Iesus, that they might bring vs into
bondage. 5 To whom we gaue not place by
subiection for an houre, that the trueth
of the Gospel might continue with you.
6 But by them which seemed to be great,
I was not taught (whatsoeuer they were
in time passed, I am nothing the better:
God accepteth no mans person) for they
that are the chiefe, did adde nothing to
me aboue that I had. 7 But contrariwise,
when they saw that ye Gospel ouer ye
vncircumcision was comitted vnto me, as
the Gospel ouer ye circumcision was vnto
Peter: 8 (For he that was mightie by Peter
in the Apostleship ouer the circumcision,Galatians 2:9
1019
was also mightie by me toward the Gen-
tiles) 9 And when Iames, and Cephas, and
Iohn, knew of the grace that was giuen
vnto me, which are counted to be pillars,
they gaue to me and to Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship, that we should
preach vnto the Gentiles, and they vnto
the Circumcision, 10 Warning onely that
we should remember the poore: which
thing also I was diligent to doe. 11 And
when Peter was come to Antiochia, I
withstood him to his face: for he was
to be condemned. 12 For before that
certaine came from Iames, he ate with the
Gentiles: but when they were come, he
withdrew and separated himselfe, fearing
them which were of the Circumcision.
13 And the other Iewes played the hyp-
ocrites likewise with him, in so much that
Barnabas was led away with them by that
their hypocrisie. 14 But when I saw, that
they went not ye right way to the trueth
of ye Gospel, I sayd vnto Peter before
all men, If thou being a Iewe, liuest as
the Gentiles, and not like the Iewes, why
constrainest thou the Gentiles to doe like
the Iewes? 15 We which are Iewes by
nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
16 Knowe that a man is not iustified by
the works of the Law, but by ye faith
of Iesus Christ, euen we, I say, haue
beleeued in Iesus Christ, that we might be
iustified by the faith of Christ, and not by
the workes of the Lawe, because that by
the workes of the Lawe, no flesh shalbe
iustified. 17 If then while we seeke to be
made righteous by Christ, we our selues
are found sinners, is Christ therefore the
minister of sinne? God forbid. 18 For
if I build againe the things that I haue
destroyed, I make my selfe a trespasser.
19 For I through the Lawe am dead to the
Lawe, that I might liue vnto God. 20 I am
crucified with Christ, but I liue, yet not I
any more, but Christ liueth in me: and in
that that I now liue in the flesh, I liue by
the faith in the Sonne of God, who hath
loued me, and giuen him selfe for me. 21 I
doe not abrogate the grace of God: for if
righteousnes be by the Lawe, then Christ
dyed without a cause.
Galatians 3:16
3
1 O
foolish Galatians, who hath be-
witched you, that ye should not obey the
trueth, to whome Iesus Christ before was
described in your sight, and among you
crucified? 2 This only would I learne of
you, Receiued ye the Spirit by the workes
of the Lawe, or by the hearing of faith
preached? 3 Are ye so foolish, that after
ye haue begun in the Spirit, ye would now
be made perfect by the flesh? 4 Haue ye
suffered so many things in vaine? if so
be it be euen in vaine. 5 He therefore
that ministreth to you the Spirit, and
worketh miracles among you, doeth he it
through the workes of the Law, or by the
hearing of faith preached? 6 Yea rather
as Abraham beleeued God, and it was
imputed to him for righteousnes. 7 Knowe
ye therefore, that they which are of faith,
the same are the children of Abraham.
8 For the Scripture foreseeing, that God
would iustifie the Gentiles through faith,
preached before the Gospel vnto Abra-
ham, saying, In thee shall all the Gentiles
be blessed. 9 So then they which be of
faith, are blessed with faithfull Abraham.
10 For as many as are of the workes of the
Lawe, are vnder the curse: for it is writ-
ten, Cursed is euery man that continueth
not in all things, which are written in the
booke of the Law, to doe them. 11 And
that no man is iustified by the Law in the
sight of God, it is euident: for the iust shall
liue by faith. 12 And the Lawe is not of
faith: but the man that shall doe those
things, shall liue in them. 13 Christ hath
redeemed vs from the curse of the Lawe,
made a curse for vs, (for it is written,
Cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree)
14 That the blessing of Abraham might
come on the Gentiles through Christ Iesus,
that wee might receiue the promise of
the Spirite through faith. 15 Brethren, I
speake as men do: though it be but a
mans couenant, when it is confirmed, yet
no man doeth abrogate it, or addeth any
thing thereto. 16 Nowe to Abraham and
his seede were the promises made. Hee
saith not, And to the seedes, as speaking
of many: but, And to thy seede, as of one,Galatians 3:17
1020
which is Christ. 17 And this I say, that
the couenant that was confirmed afore
of God in respect of Christ, the Lawe
which was foure hundreth and thirtie
yeeres after, can not disanull, that it
shoulde make the promise of none effect.
18 For if the inheritance be of the Lawe,
it is no more by the promise, but God
gaue it freely vnto Abraham by promise.
19 Wherefore then serueth the Law? It
was added because of the transgressions,
til the seed came, vnto the which the
promise was made: and it was ordeined
by Angels in the hande of a Mediatour.
20 Nowe a Mediatour is not a Mediatour
of one: but God is one. 21 Is the Lawe
then against the promises of God? God
forbid: For if there had bene a Lawe
giuen which coulde haue giuen life, surely
righteousnes should haue bene by the
Lawe. 22 But the Scripture hath concluded
all vnder sinne, that the promise by the
faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to
them that beleeue. 23 But before faith
came, we were kept vnder the Law,
as vnder a garison, and shut vp vnto
that faith, which should afterward be
reueiled. 24 Wherefore the Lawe was our
scholemaster to bring vs to Christ, that
we might be made righteous by faith.
25 But after that faith is come, we are no
longer vnder a scholemaster. 26 For ye are
al the sonnes of God by faith, in Christ
Iesus. 27 For all ye that are baptized into
Christ, haue put on Christ. 28 There is
neither Iewe nor Grecian: there is neither
bonde nor free: there is neither male
nor female: for ye are all one in Christ
Iesus. 29 And if ye be Christes, then are ye
Abrahams seede, and heires by promise.
4
1 Then I say, that the heire as long as
hee is a childe, differeth nothing from
a seruant, though he be Lord of all,
2 But is vnder tutours and gouernours,
vntil the time appointed of the Father.
3 Euen so, we when wee were children,
were in bondage vnder the rudiments
of the world. 4 But when the fulnesse
of time was come, God sent forth his
Sonne made of a woman, and made vnder
Galatians 4:23
the Lawe, 5 That hee might redeeme
them which were vnder the Law, that we
might receiue the adoption of the sonnes.
6 And because ye are sonnes, God hath
sent foorth the Spirit of his Sonne into
your heartes, which crieth, Abba, Father.
7 Wherefore, thou art no more a seruant,
but a sonne: now if thou be a sone,
thou art also the heire of God through
Christ. 8 But euen then, when ye knewe
not God, yee did seruice vnto them, which
by nature are not gods: 9 But now seeing
ye knowe God, yea, rather are knowen of
God, howe turne ye againe vnto impotent
and beggerly rudiments, whereunto as
from the beginning ye wil be in bondage
againe? 10 Ye obserue dayes, and mon-
eths, and times and yeeres. 11 I am in
feare of you, lest I haue bestowed on you
labour in vaine. 12 Be ye as I (for I am
euen as you) brethren, I beseech you:
ye haue not hurt me at all. 13 And ye
know, how through infirmitie of the flesh,
I preached ye Gospel vnto you at the first.
14 And the trial of me which was in my
flesh, ye despised not, neither abhorred:
but ye receiued me as an Angel of God,
yea, as Christ Iesus. 15 What was then
your felicitie? for I beare you recorde,
that if it had bene possible, ye would haue
plucked out your owne eyes, and haue
giuen them vnto me. 16 Am I therefore
become your enemie, because I tell you
the trueth? 17 They are ielous ouer you
amisse: yea, they woulde exclude you,
that ye shoulde altogether loue them.
18 But it is a good thing to loue earnestly
alwayes in a good thing, and not onely
when I am present with you, 19 My litle
children, of whome I trauaile in birth
againe, vntill Christ be formed in you.
20 And I would I were with you nowe,
that I might change my voyce: for I am
in doubt of you. 21 Tell me, ye that will
be vnder the Law, doe ye not heare the
Lawe? 22 For it is written, that Abraham
had two sonnes, one by a seruant, and
one by a free woman. 23 But he which
was of the seruant, was borne after the
flesh: and he which was of the freeGalatians 4:24
1021
woman, was borne by promise. 24 By the
which things another thing is meant: for
these mothers are the two testaments, the
one which is Agar of mount Sina, which
gendreth vnto bondage. 25 (For Agar or
Sina is a mountaine in Arabia, and it
answereth to Hierusalem which nowe is)
and she is in bondage with her children.
26 But Hierusalem, which is aboue, is free:
which is the mother of vs all. 27 For it is
written, Reioyce thou barren that bearest
no children: breake forth, and cry, thou
that trauailest not: for the desolate hath
many moe children, then she which hath
an husband. 28 Therefore, brethren, wee
are after the maner of Isaac, children of
the promise. 29 But as then hee that was
borne after the flesh, persecuted him that
was borne after the Spirit, euen so it is
nowe. 30 But what sayth the Scripture?
Put out the seruant and her sonne: for
the sonne of the seruant shall not be
heire with the sonne of the free woman.
31 Then brethren, we are not children of
the seruant, but of the free woman.
1 Stand
5
fast therefore in the libertie
wherewith Christ hath made vs free, and
be not intangled againe with the yoke
of bondage. 2 Beholde, I Paul say vnto
you, that if yee be circumcised, Christ
shall profite you nothing. 3 For I testifie
againe to euery man, which is circum-
cised, that he is bound to keepe the
whole Lawe. 4 Ye are abolished from
Christ: whosoeuer are iustified by the
Law, ye are fallen from grace. 5 For we
through the Spirit waite for the hope of
righteousnes through faith. 6 For in Iesus
Christ neither circumcision auaileth any
thing, neither vncircumcision, but faith
which worketh by loue. 7 Ye did runne
well: who did let you, that ye did not obey
the trueth? 8 It is not the perswasion of
him that calleth you. 9 A litle leauen doeth
leauen the whole lumpe. 10 I haue trust in
you through the Lord, that ye will be none
otherwise minded: but hee that trou-
bleth you, shall beare his condemnation,
whosoeuer he be. 11 And brethren, if I yet
preach circumcision, why doe I yet suffer
Galatians 6:4
persecution? Then is the slaunder of the
crosse abolished. 12 Would to God they
were euen cut off, which doe disquiet you.
13 For brethren, ye haue bene called vnto
libertie: onely vse not your libertie as
an occasion vnto the flesh, but by loue
serue one another. 14 For all the Lawe
is fulfilled in one worde, which is this,
Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.
15 If ye bite and deuoure one another,
take heede least ye be consumed one of
another. 16 Then I say, Walke in the Spirit,
and ye shall not fulfill the lustes of the
flesh. 17 For the flesh lusteth against the
Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh:
and these are contrary one to another,
so that ye can not doe the same things
that ye would. 18 And if ye be led by
the Spirit, ye are not vnder the Lawe.
19 Moreouer the workes of the flesh are
manifest, which are adulterie, fornica-
tion, vncleannes, wantonnes, 20 Idolatrie,
witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations,
wrath, contentions, seditions, heresies,
21 Enuie, murthers, drunkennesse, glut-
tonie, and such like, whereof I tell you
before, as I also haue tolde you before,
that they which doe such things, shall not
inherite the kingdome of God. 22 But the
fruite of the Spirit is loue, ioye, peace,
long suffering, gentlenes, goodnes, fayth,
23 Meekenesse, temperancie: against such
there is no lawe. 24 For they that are
Christes, haue crucified the flesh with the
affections and the lustes. 25 If we liue
in the Spirit, let vs also walke in the
Spirit. 26 Let vs not be desirous of vaine
glorie, prouoking one another, enuying
one another.

1 Brethren, if a man be suddenly taken
in any offence, ye which are spiritu-
all, restore such one with the spirit of
meekenes, considering thy selfe, least
thou also be tempted. 2 Beare ye one
anothers burden, and so fulfill the Lawe
of Christ. 3 For if any man seeme to
himselfe, that he is somewhat, when he
is nothing, hee deceiueth himselfe in his
imagination. 4 But let euery man prooueGalatians 6:5
1022
his owne worke: and then shall he haue
reioycing in himselfe onely and not in
another. 5 For euery man shall beare his
owne burden. 6 Let him that is taught
in the worde, make him that hath taught
him, partaker of all his goods. 7 Be
not deceiued: God is not mocked: for
whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shall hee
also reape. 8 For hee that soweth to his
flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption:
but hee that soweth to the spirit, shall of
the spirit reape life euerlasting. 9 Let vs
not therefore be weary of well doing: for
in due season we shall reape, if we faint
not. 10 While we haue therefore time, let
vs doe good vnto all men, but specially
vnto them, which are of the housholde
of faith. 11 Ye see how large a letter I
haue written vnto you with mine owne
hand. 12 As many as desire to make a faire
shewe in the flesh, they constraine you to
be circumcised, onely because they would
not suffer persecution for the crosse of
Christ. 13 For they themselues which are
circumcised keepe not the law, but desire
to haue you circumcised, that they might
reioyce in your flesh. 14 But God forbid
that I should reioyce, but in ye crosse of
our Lord Iesus Christ, whereby the world
is crucified vnto me, and I vnto ye world.
15 For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision
auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision,
but a newe creature. 16 And as many as
walke according to this rule, peace shalbe
vpon them, and mercie, and vpon the
Israel of God. 17 From henceforth let no
man put me to busines: for I beare in
my body the markes of the Lord Iesus.
18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Iesus
Christ be with your spirit, Amen. ‘Vnto
the Galatians written from Rome.’

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
THE APOSTLE TO THE
EPHESIANS
1 Pavl
an Apostle of Jesvs Christ by
the will of God, to the Saints, which
are at Ephesus, and to ye faithfull in
Christ Iesus: 2 Grace be with you, and
peace from God our Father, and from
the Lord Iesus Christ. 3 Blessed be God,
and the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,
which hath blessed vs with all spirituall
blessing in heauenly thinges in Christ, 4 As
hee hath chosen vs in him, before the
foundation of the worlde, that we should
be holy, and without blame before him
in loue: 5 Who hath predestinate vs, to
be adopted through Iesus Christ in him
selfe, according to the good pleasure of
his will, 6 To the prayse of the glory of
his grace, wherewith he hath made vs
freely accepted in his beloued, 7 By whom
we haue redemption through his blood,
euen the forgiuenes of sinnes, according
to his rich grace: 8 Whereby he hath bene
aboundant toward vs in all wisedome and
vnderstanding, 9 And hath opened vnto
vs the mysterie of his will according to
his good pleasure, which he had purposed
in him, 10 That in the dispensation of the
fulnesse of the times, he might gather
together in one all things, both which are
in heauen, and which are in earth, euen
in Christ: 11 In whom also we are chosen
when we were predestinate according to
ye purpose of him, which worketh all
things after the counsell of his owne will,
12 That we, which first trusted in Christ,
should be vnto the praise of his glorie:
13 In whom also ye haue trusted, after
that ye heard the worde of trueth, euen
the Gospel of your saluation, wherein also
after that ye beleeued, ye were sealed
with the holy Spirite of promise, 14 Which
is the earnest of our inheritance, for
the redemption of that libertie purchased
vnto the prayse of his glory. 15 Therefore
also after that I heard of the faith, which
ye haue in the Lord Iesus, and loue
Ephesians 2:8
toward all the Saints, 16 I cease not to
giue thankes for you, making mention
of you in my prayers, 17 That the God
of our Lord Iesus Christ, that Father of
glory, might giue vnto you the Spirit of
wisedome, and reuelation through the
acknowledging of him, 18 That the eyes
of your vnderstanding may be lightened,
that ye may knowe what the hope is
of his calling, and what the riches of
his glorious inheritance is in the Saints,
19 And what is the exceeding greatnesse
of his power toward vs, which beleeue,
according to the working of his mightie
power, 20 Which he wrought in Christ,
when he raised him from the dead, and
set him at his right hand in the heauenly
places, 21 Farre aboue al principalitie, and
power, and might, and domination, and
euery Name, that is named, not in this
world only, but also in that that is to
come, 22 And hath made all things subiect
vnder his feete, and hath giuen him ouer
all things to be the head to the Church,
23 Which is his body, euen the fulnesse of
him that filleth all in all things.
2
1 And you hath he quickened, that were
dead in trespasses and sinnes, 2 Wherein,
in times past ye walked, according to
the course of this world, and after the
prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the
spirite, that nowe worketh in the children
of disobedience, 3 Among whom we also
had our conuersation in time past, in the
lustes of our flesh, in fulfilling the will
of the flesh, and of the minde, and were
by nature the children of wrath, as well
as others. 4 But God which is rich in
mercie, through his great loue wherewith
he loued vs, 5 Euen when we were dead
by sinnes, hath quickened vs together in
Christ, by whose grace ye are saued, 6 And
hath raysed vs vp together, and made
vs sit together in the heauenly places in
Christ Iesus, 7 That he might shewe in
the ages to come the exceeding riches of
his grace, through his kindnesse toward
vs in Christ Iesus. 8 For by grace are
ye saued through faith, and that not ofEphesians 2:9
1024
your selues: it is the gift of God, 9 Not
of workes, least any man should boast
himselfe. 10 For we are his workemanship
created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes,
which God hath ordeined, that we should
walke in them. 11 Wherefore remember
that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
flesh, and called vncircumcision of them,
which are called circumcision in the flesh,
made with hands, 12 That ye were, I say,
at that time without Christ, and were
alients from the common wealth of Israel,
and were strangers from the couenants
of promise, and had no hope, and were
without God in the world. 13 But nowe
in Christ Iesus, ye which once were farre
off, are made neere by the blood of Christ.
14 For he is our peace, which hath made
of both one, and hath broken the stoppe
of the partition wall, 15 In abrogating
through his flesh the hatred, that is, the
Lawe of commandements which standeth
in ordinances, for to make of twaine
one newe man in himselfe, so making
peace, 16 And that he might reconcile both
vnto God in one body by his crosse, and
slay hatred thereby, 17 And came, and
preached peace to you which were afarre
off, and to them that were neere. 18 For
through him we both haue an entrance
vnto the Father by one Spirit. 19 Nowe
therefore ye are no more strangers and
forreiners: but citizens with the Saintes,
and of the houshold of God, 20 And are
built vpon the foundation of the Apostles
and Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe being
the chiefe corner stone, 21 In whom all the
building coupled together, groweth vnto
an holy Temple in the Lord. 22 In whom ye
also are built together to be the habitation
of God by the Spirit.
3
1 For this cause, I Paul am the prisoner
of Iesus Christ for you Gentiles, 2 If ye
haue heard of the dispensation of the
grace of God, which is giuen me to
you warde, 3 That is, that God by reue-
lation hath shewed this mysterie vnto
me (as I wrote aboue in fewe wordes,
4 Whereby when ye reade, ye may knowe
Ephesians 3:21
mine vnderstanding in the mysterie of
Christ) 5 Which in other ages was not
opened vnto the sonnes of men, as it is
nowe reueiled vnto his holy Apostles and
Prophets by the Spirit, 6 That the Gentiles
should be inheriters also, and of the same
body, and partakers of his promise in
Christ by the Gospel, 7 Whereof I am made
a minister by the gift of the grace of
God giuen vnto me through the effectuall
working of his power. 8 Euen vnto me
the least of all Saints is this grace giuen,
that I should preach among the Gentiles
the vnsearchable riches of Christ, 9 And
to make cleare vnto all men what the
fellowship of the mysterie is, which from
the beginning of the world hath bene
hid in God, who hath created all things
by Iesus Christ, 10 To the intent, that
nowe vnto principalities and powers in
heauenly places, might be knowen by
the Church the manifolde wisedome of
God, 11 According to the eternall purpose,
which he wrought in Christ Iesus our
Lord: 12 By whom we haue boldenes
and entrance with confidence, by faith
in him. 13 Wherefore I desire that ye
faint not at my tribulations for your sakes,
which is your glory. 14 For this cause
I bowe my knees vnto the Father of
our Lord Iesus Christ, 15 (Of whom is
named the whole familie in heauen and
in earth) 16 That he might graunt you
according to the riches of his glorie, that
ye may be strengthened by his Spirit in
the inner man, 17 That Christ may dwell
in your heartes by faith: 18 That ye, being
rooted and grounded in loue, may be
able to comprehend with al Saints, what
is the breadth, and length, and depth,
and height: 19 And to knowe the loue of
Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
may be filled with all fulnesse of God.
20 Vnto him therefore that is able to do
exceeding aboundantly aboue all that we
aske or thinke, according to the power
that worketh in vs, 21 Be praise in the
Church by Christ Iesus, throughout all
generations for euer, Amen.Ephesians 4:1

1 I therefore, being prisoner in the Lord,
praie you that yee walke worthie of the
vocation whereunto yee are called, 2 With
all humblenesse of minde, and meeke-
nesse, with long suffering, supporting one
an other through loue, 3 Endeuouring to
keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond
of peace. 4 There is one body, and one
Spirit, euen as yee are called in one hope
of your vocation. 5 There is one Lord, one
Faith, one Baptisme, 6 One God and Father
of all, which is aboue all, and through
all, and in you all. 7 But vnto euery
one of vs is giuen grace, according to the
measure of the gift of Christ. 8 Wherfore
he saith, Whe he asceded vp on hie, he
led captiuity captiue, and gaue gifts vnto
men. 9 (Nowe, in that hee ascended, what
is it but that he had also descended first
into the lowest partes of the earth? 10 Hee
that descended, is euen the same that as-
cended, farre aboue all heauens, that hee
might fill all things) 11 Hee therefore gaue
some to be Apostles, and some Prophets,
and some Euangelists, and some Pastours,
and Teachers, 12 For the repairing of the
Saintes, for the woorke of the ministerie,
and for the edification of the bodie of
Christ, 13 Till we all meete together (in
the vnitie of faith and that acknowledging
of the Sonne of God) vnto a perfite man,
and vnto the measure of the age of the
fulnesse of Christ, 14 That we henceforth
be no more children, wauering and caried
about with euery winde of doctrine, by
the deceit of men, and with craftines,
whereby they lay in wait to deceiue.
15 But let vs folowe the truth in loue, and
in all things, grow vp into him, which is
the head, that is, Christ. 16 By whome
al the body being coupled and knit to-
gether by euery ioynt, for ye furniture
therof (according to the effectual power,
which is in the measure of euery part)
receiueth increase of the body, vnto the
edifying of itselfe in loue. 17 This I say
therefore and testifie in the Lord, that yee
hencefoorth walke not as other Gentiles
walke, in vanitie of their minde, 18 Hauing
their vnderstanding darkened, and being
Ephesians 5:4
strangers from the life of God through the
ignorance that is in them, because of the
hardnesse of their heart: 19 Which being
past feeling, haue giuen themselues vnto
wantonnesse, to woorke all vncleannesse,
euen with griedinesse. 20 But yee haue
not so learned Christ, 21 If so be yee haue
heard him, and haue bene taught by him,
as the trueth is in Iesus, 22 That is, that
yee cast off, concerning the conuersation
in time past, that olde man, which is
corrupt through the deceiueable lustes,
23 And be renued in the spirit of your
minde, 24 And put on ye new man, which
after God is created vnto righteousnes,
and true holines. 25 Wherefore cast off
lying, and speake euery man truth vnto
his neighbour: for we are members one
of another. 26 Bee angrie, but sinne not:
let not the sunne goe downe vpon your
wrath, 27 Neither giue place to the deuill.
28 Let him that stole, steale no more:
but let him rather labour, and worke
with his handes the thing which is good,
that hee may haue to giue vnto him that
needeth. 29 Let no corrupt comunication
proceed out of your mouths: but that
which is good, to ye vse of edifying, that
it may minister grace vnto the hearers.
30 And grieue not the holy Spirit of God,
by whom ye are sealed vnto ye day
of redemption. 31 Let all bitternesse,
and anger, and wrath, crying, and euill
speaking be put away from you, with all
maliciousnesse. 32 Be ye courteous one
to another, and tender hearted, freely
forgiuing one another, euen as God for
Christes sake, freely forgaue you.
1 Bee
5
yee therefore followers of God,
as deare children, 2 And walke in loue,
euen as Christ hath loued vs, and hath
giuen himselfe for vs, to be an offering
and a sacrifice of a sweete smellling
sauour to God. 3 But fornication, and
all vncleannesse, or couetousnesse, let
it not be once named among you, as it
becommeth Saintes, 4 Neither filthinesse,
neither foolish talking, neither iesting,
which are things not comely, but ratherEphesians 5:5
1026
giuing of thankes. 5 For this ye know,
that no whoremonger, neither vncleane
person, nor couetous person, which is
an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
kingdome of Christ, and of God. 6 Let
no man deceiue you with vaine wordes:
for, for such thinges commeth the wrath
of God vpon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not therefore companions with them.
8 For ye were once darkenesse, but are
nowe light in the Lord: walke as children
of light, 9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in
al goodnes, and righteousnes, and trueth)
10 Approuing that which is pleasing to the
Lord. 11 And haue no fellowship with
ye vnfruitfull works of darknes, but euen
reproue them rather. 12 For it is shame
euen to speake of the things which are
done of them in secret. 13 But all thinges
when they are reproued of the light, are
manifest: for it is light that maketh all
things manifest. 14 Wherefore hee sayeth,
Awake thou that sleepest, and stande vp
from the deade, and Christ shall giue thee
light. 15 Take heede therefore that yee
walke circumspectly, not as fooles, but as
wise, 16 Redeeming ye season: for ye daies
are euill. 17 Wherefore, be ye not vnwise,
but vnderstand what the will of the Lord
is. 18 And be not drunke with wine,
wherein is excesse: but be fulfilled with
the Spirit, 19 Speaking vnto your selues
in psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall
songs, singing, and making melodie to the
Lord in your hearts, 20 Giuing thankes
alwaies for all thinges vnto God euen the
Father, in the Name of our Lord Iesus
Christ, 21 Submitting your selues one to
another in the feare of God. 22 Wiues,
submit your selues vnto your husbands,
as vnto the Lord. 23 For the husband
is the wiues head, euen as Christ is the
head of the Church, and the same is the
sauiour of his body. 24 Therfore as the
Church is in subiection to Christ, euen
so let the wiues be to their husbands
in euery thing. 25 Husbands, loue your
wiues, euen as Christ loued the Church,
and gaue himselfe for it, 26 That hee might
sanctifie it, and clense it by the washing
of water through the worde, 27 That hee
Ephesians 6:12
might make it vnto him selfe a glorious
Church, not hauing spot or wrinkle, or
any such thing: but that it shoulde bee
holy and without blame. 28 So ought men
to loue their wiues, as their owne bodies:
he that loueth his wife, loueth him selfe.
29 For no man euer yet hated his owne
flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
euen as the Lord doeth the Church. 30 For
we are members of his bodie, of his flesh,
and of his bones. 31 For this cause shall
a man leaue father and mother, and shall
cleaue to his wife, and they twaine shalbe
one flesh. 32 This is a great secrete, but I
speake concerning Christ, and concerning
the Church. 33 Therefore euery one of
you, doe ye so: let euery one loue his wife,
euen as himselfe, and let the wife see that
shee feare her husband.
1 Children,
6
obey your parents in the
Lord: for this is right. 2 Honour thy father
and mother (which is the first commande-
ment with promise) 3 That it may be well
with thee, and that thou mayst liue long
on earth. 4 And ye, fathers, prouoke not
your children to wrath: but bring them
vp in instruction and information of the
Lord. 5 Seruants, be obedient vnto them
that are your masters, according to the
flesh, with feare and trembling in single-
nesse of your hearts as vnto Christ, 6 Not
with seruice to the eye, as men pleasers,
but as the seruants of Christ, doing the
will of God from the heart, 7 With good
will, seruing the Lord, and not men. 8 And
knowe ye that whatsoeuer good thing any
man doeth, that same shall he receiue of
the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
9 And ye masters, doe the same things
vnto them, putting away threatning: and
know that euen your master also is in
heauen, neither is there respect of person
with him. 10 Finally, my brethren, be
strong in the Lord, and in the power of
his might. 11 Put on the whole armour
of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the assaultes of the deuil. 12 For
we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
but against principalities, against powers,Ephesians 6:13
1027
and against the worldly gouernours, the
princes of the darkenesse of this worlde,
against spirituall wickednesses, which are
in ye hie places. 13 For this cause take
vnto you the whole armour of God, that
ye may be able to resist in the euill
day, and hauing finished all things, stand
fast. 14 Stand therefore, and your loynes
girded about with veritie, and hauing on
the brest plate of righteousnesse, 15 And
your feete shod with the preparation of
the Gospel of peace. 16 Aboue all, take
the shielde of faith, wherewith ye may
quench all the fierie dartes of the wicked,
17 And take the helmet of saluation, and
the sword of the Spirit, which is the

worde of God.
with all maner prayer and supplication
in the Spirit: and watch thereunto with
all perseuerance and supplication for al
Saints, 19 And for me, that vtterance may
be giuen vnto me, that I may open my
mouth boldly to publish the secret of the
Gospel, 20 Whereof I am the ambassadour
in bonds, that therein I may speake bold-
ely, as I ought to speake. 21 But that ye
may also know mine affaires, and what
I doe, Tychicus my deare brother and
faithfull minister in the Lord, shall shewe
you of all things, 22 Whom I haue sent
vnto you for the same purpose, that ye
might knowe mine affaires, and that he
might comfort your hearts. 23 Peace be
with the brethren, and loue with faith
from God the Father, and from the Lord
Iesus Christ. 24 Grace be with all them
which loue our Lord Iesus Christ, to their

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
THE APOSTLE TO THE
PHILIPPIANS
1 Paul and Timotheus the seruants of
IESVS CHRIST, to all the Saintes in Christ
Iesus which are at Philippi, with the
Bishops, and Deacons: 2 Grace be with
you, and peace from God our Father, and
from the Lord Iesus Christ. 3 I thanke
my God, hauing you in perfect memorie,
4 (Alwayes in all my praiers for all you,
praying with gladnesse) 5 Because of the
fellowship which ye haue in the Gospel,
from the first day vnto nowe. 6 And I am
persuaded of this same thing, that he that
hath begunne this good worke in you, wil
perfourme it vntill the day of Iesus Christ,
7 As it becommeth me so to iudge of you
all, because I haue you in remembrance
that both in my bands, and in my defence,
and confirmation of the Gospell you all
were partakers of my grace. 8 For God is
my recorde, howe I long after you all from
the very heart roote in Iesus Christ. 9 And
this I pray, that your loue may abound,
yet more and more in knowledge, and
in all iudgement, 10 That ye may alowe
those things which are best, that ye may
be pure, and without offence vntill the
day of Christ, 11 Filled with the fruites of
righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ
vnto the glorie and praise of God. 12 I
would ye vnderstood, brethren, that the
things which haue come vnto me, are
turned rather to the furthering of the
Gospell, 13 So that my bandes in Christ
are famous throughout all the iudgement
hall, and in all other places, 14 In so
much that many of the brethren in the
Lord are boldened through my bandes,
and dare more frankely speake the word.
15 Some preache.
Christ euen through
enuie and strife, and some also of good
will. 16 The one part preacheth Christ of
contention and not purely, supposing to
adde more affliction to my bandes. 17 But
the others of loue, knowing that I am set
Philippians 2:3
for the defence of the Gospell. 18 What
then? yet Christ is preached all maner
wayes, whether it be vnder a pretence,
or syncerely: and I therein ioye: yea
and will ioye. 19 For I knowe that this
shall turne to my saluation through your
prayer, and by the helpe of the Spirit
of Iesus Christ, 20 As I feruently looke
for, and hope, that in nothing I shalbe
ashamed, but that with all confidence, as
alwayes, so nowe Christ shalbe magnified
in my body, whether it be by life or by
death. 21 For Christ is to me both in life,
and in death aduantage. 22 And whether
to liue in the flesh were profitable for me,
and what to chuse I knowe not. 23 For
I am distressed betweene both, desiring
to be loosed and to be with Christ, which
is best of all. 24 Neuerthelesse, to abide
in the flesh, is more needefull for you.
25 And this am I sure of, that I shall
abide, and with you all continue, for
your furtherance and ioy of your faith,
26 That ye may more aboundantly reioyce
in IESVS CHRIST for me, by my com-
ming to you againe. 27 Onely let your
conuersation be, as it becommeth the
Gospel of Christ, that whether I come and
see you, or els be absent, I may heare
of your matters that ye continue in one
Spirit, and in one mind, fighting together
through the faith of the Gospel. 28 And in
nothing feare your aduersaries, which is
to them a token of perdition, and to you
of saluation, and that of God. 29 For vnto
you it is giuen for Christ, that not onely ye
should beleeue in him, but also suffer for
his sake, 30 Hauing the same fight, which
ye sawe in me, and nowe heare to be in
me.
2
1 If there be therfore any consolation
in Christ, if any comfort of loue, if any
fellowship of the Spirit, if any compassion
and mercie, 2 Fulfill my ioye, that ye
be like minded, hauing the same loue,
being of one accorde, and of one iudge-
ment, 3 That nothing be done through
contention or vaine glory, but that in
meekenesse of minde euery man esteemePhilippians 2:4
1029
other better then himselfe. 4 Looke not
euery man on his owne things, but euery
man also on the things of other men.
5 Let the same minde be in you that was
euen in Christ Iesus, 6 Who being in ye
forme of God, thought it no robberie to be
equall with God: 7 But he made himself
of no reputation, and tooke on him ye
forme of a seruant, and was made like
vnto men, and was founde in shape as a
man. 8 He humbled himselfe, and became
obedient vnto the death, euen the death
of the Crosse. 9 Wherefore God hath
also highly exalted him, and giuen him a
Name aboue euery name, 10 That at the
Name of Iesus shoulde euery knee bowe,
both of things in heauen, and things in
earth, and things vnder the earth, 11 And
that euery tongue shoulde confesse that
Iesus Christ is the Lord, vnto the glory of
God the Father. 12 Wherefore my beloued,
as ye haue alwayes obeyed me, not as in
my presence only, but now much more
in mine absence, so make an end of your
owne saluation with feare and trembling.
13 For it is God which worketh in you,
both the will and the deede, euen of his
good pleasure. 14 Do all things without
murmuring and reasonings, 15 That ye
may be blamelesse, and pure, and the
sonnes of God without rebuke in the
middes of a naughtie and crooked nation,
among whom yee shine as lights in the
world, 16 Holding forth the worde of life,
that I may reioyce in the day of Christ,
that I haue not runne in vaine, neither
haue laboured in vaine. 17 Yea, and
though I bee offered vp vpon the sacrifice,
and seruice of your faith, I am glad, and
reioyce with you all. 18 For the same
cause also be ye glad, and reioyce with
me. 19 And I trust in the Lord Iesus, to
sende Timotheus shortly vnto you, that
I also may be of good comfort, when I
knowe your state. 20 For I haue no man
like minded, who will faithfully care for
your matters. 21 For all seeke their owne,
and not that which is Iesus Christes. 22 But
yee knowe the proofe of him, that as a
sonne with the father, hee hath serued
with me in the Gospel. 23 Him therefore
Philippians 3:8
I hope to send assoone as I knowe howe
it will goe with me, 24 And trust in the
Lord, that I also my selfe shall come
shortly. 25 But I supposed it necessarie to
sende my brother Epaphroditus vnto you,
my companion in labour, and fellowe
souldier, euen your messenger, and he
that ministred vnto me such things as I
wanted. 26 For he longed after all you, and
was full of heauinesse, because yee had
heard that hee had beene sicke. 27 And
no doubt he was sicke, very neere vnto
death: but God had mercie on him, and
not on him onely, but on me also, least
I should haue sorowe vpon sorowe. 28 I
sent him therefore the more diligently,
that when yee shoulde see him againe,
yee might reioyce, and I might be the lesse
sorowfull. 29 Receiue him therefore in the
Lord with all gladnesse, and make much
of such: 30 Because that for the woorke
of Christ he was neere vnto death, and
regarded not his life, to fulfill that seruice
which was lacking on your part towarde
me.

1 Moreouer, my brethren, reioyce in the
Lord. It grieueth mee not to write the
same things to you, and for you it is a
sure thing. 2 Beware of dogges: beware
of euil workers: beware of the concision.
3 For we are the circumcision, which
worship God in the spirite, and reioyce
in Christ Iesus, and haue no confidence
in the flesh: 4 Though I might also haue
confidence in the flesh. If any other
man thinketh that he hath whereof he
might trust in the flesh, much more I,

Ebrewe of the Ebrewes, by the Lawe a

ye Church: touching the righteousnesse
which is in the Law, I was vnrebukeable.
7 But the thinges that were vantage vnto
me, the same I counted losse for Christes
sake. 8 Yea, doubtlesse I thinke all thinges
but losse for the excellent knowledge sake
of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whome I
haue counted all things losse, and doe
iudge them to bee dongue, that I mightPhilippians 3:9
1030
winne Christ, 9 And might bee founde
in him, that is, not hauing mine owne
righteousnesse, which is of the Lawe, but
that which is through the faith of Christ,
euen the righteousnesse which is of God
through faith, 10 That I may know him,
and the vertue of his resurrection, and
the fellowship of his afflictions, and be
made conformable vnto his death, 11 If
by any meanes I might attaine vnto the
resurrection of the dead: 12 Not as though
I had alreadie attained to it, either were
alreadie perfect: but I follow, if that I
may comprehend that for whose sake
also I am comprehended of Christ Iesus.
13 Brethren, I count not my selfe, that
I haue attained to it, but one thing I
doe: I forget that which is behinde, and
endeuour my selfe vnto that which is
before, 14 And follow hard toward the
marke, for the prise of the hie calling of
God in Christ Iesus. 15 Let vs therefore
as many as be perfect, be thus minded:
and if yee be otherwise minded, God
shall reueile euen the same vnto you.
16 Neuerthelesse, in that whereunto wee
are come, let vs proceede by one rule, that
wee may minde one thing. 17 Brethren,
bee followers of mee, and looke on them,
which walke so, as yee haue vs for an
ensample. 18 For many walke, of whom
I haue told you often, and nowe tell you
weeping, that they are the enemies of the
Crosse of Christ: 19 Whose ende is damna-
tion, whose God is their bellie, and whose
glorie is to their shame, which minde
earthly things. 20 But our conuersation is
in heauen, from whence also we looke for
the Sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ,
21 Who shall change our vile bodie, that
it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious
body, according to the working, whereby
hee is able euen to subdue all things vnto
him selfe.

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
THE APOSTLE TO THE
COLOSSIANS
1 Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by the
will of God, and Timotheus our brother,
2 To them which are at Colosse, Saintes
and faithfull brethren in Christ: Grace
bee with you, and peace from God our
Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.
3 We giue thankes to God euen ye Father
of our Lord Iesus Christ, alway praying
for you: 4 Since wee heard of your faith
in Christ Iesus, and of your loue toward
all Saintes, 5 For the hopes sake, which is
laide vp for you in heauen, whereof yee
haue heard before by the word of trueth,
which is the Gospel, 6 Which is come vnto
you, eue as it is vnto al the world, and
is fruitful, as it is also amog you, from
ye day that ye heard and truely knew
ye grace of God, 7 As yee also learned
of Epaphras our deare fellowe seruaunt,
which is for you a faithfull minister of
Christ: 8 Who hath also declared vnto
vs your loue in the Spirit. 9 For this
cause wee also, since the day wee heard
of it, cease not to pray for you, and
to desire that ye might be fulfilled with
knowledge of his will in all wisdome,
and spirituall vnderstanding, 10 That ye
might walke worthy of the Lord, and
please him in all things, being fruitefull
in all good workes, and increasing in
the knowledge of God, 11 Strengthened
with all might through his glorious power,
vnto all patience, and long suffering with
ioyfulnesse, 12 Giuing thankes vnto the
Father, which hath made vs meete to
be partakers of the inheritance of the
Saintes in light, 13 Who hath deliuered
vs from the power of darkenesse, and
hath translated vs into the kingdome of
his deare Sonne, 14 In whome we haue
redemption through his blood, that is,
the forgiuenesse of sinnes, 15 Who is
the image of the inuisible God, the first
begotten of euery creature. 16 For by
him were all things created, which are in
Colossians 2:1
heauen, and which are in earth, thinges
visible and inuisible: whether they be
Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities,
or Powers, all things were created by
him, and for him, 17 And hee is before
all things, and in him all things consist.
18 And hee is the head of the body of
the Church: he is the beginning, and
the first begotten of the dead, that in all
thinges hee might haue the preeminence.
19 For it pleased the Father, that in him
should all fulnesse dwell, 20 And through
peace made by that blood of that his
crosse, to reconcile to himselfe through
him, through him, I say, all thinges, both
which are in earth, and which are in
heauen. 21 And you which were in times
past strangers and enemies, because your
mindes were set in euill workes, hath
he nowe also reconciled, 22 In that body
of his flesh through death, to make you
holy, and vnblameable and without fault
in his sight, 23 If ye continue, grounded
and stablished in the faith, and be not
moued away from the hope of the Gospel,
whereof ye haue heard, and which hath
bene preached to euery creature which is
vnder heauen, whereof I Paul am a min-
ister. 24 Now reioyce I in my suffrings for
you, and fulfill the rest of the afflictions
of Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake,
which is the Church, 25 Whereof I am a
minister, according to the dispensation of
God, which is giuen mee vnto you ward,
to fulfill the word of God, 26 Which is
the mysterie hid since the world began,
and from all ages, but nowe is made
manifest to his Saintes, 27 To whome
God woulde make knowen what is the
riches of his glorious mysterie among the
Gentiles, which riches is Christ in you,
the hope of glory, 28 Whome we preache,
admonishing euery man, and teaching
euery man in all wisdome, that we may
present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus,
29 Whereunto I also labour and striue,
according to his working which worketh
in me mightily.
1 For
2
I woulde ye knewe what greatColossians 2:2
1033
fighting I haue for your sakes, and for
them of Laodicea, and for as many as
haue not seene my person in the flesh,
2 That their heartes might be comforted,
and they knit together in loue, and in
all riches of the full assurance of vnder-
standing, to know the mysterie of God,
euen the Father, and of Christ: 3 In whom
are hid all the treasures of wisedome and
knowledge. 4 And this I say, lest any
man shoulde beguile you with entising
wordes: 5 For though I be absent in the
flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
reioycing and beholding your order, and
your stedfast faith in Christ. 6 As ye haue
therefore receiued Christ Iesus the Lord,
so walke in him, 7 Rooted and built in
him, and stablished in the faith, as ye
haue bene taught, abouding therein with
thankesgiuing. 8 Beware lest there be any
man that spoile you through philosophie,
and vaine deceit, through the traditions
of men, according to the rudiments of
the world, and not after Christ. 9 For
in him dwelleth all the fulnesse of the
Godhead bodily. 10 And yee are complete
in him, which is the head of all prin-
cipalitie and power. 11 In whome also
yee are circumcised with circumcision
made without handes, by putting off the
sinfull body of the flesh, through the
circumcision of Christ, 12 In that yee are
buried with him through baptisme, in
whome ye are also raised vp together
through the faith of the operation of God,
which raised him from the dead. 13 And
you which were dead in sinnes, and in
the vncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
quickened together with him, forgiuing
you all your trespasses, 14 And putting
out the hand writing of ordinances that
was against vs, which was contrarie to
vs, hee euen tooke it out of the way, and
fastened it vpon the crosse, 15 And hath
spoyled the Principalities, and Powers,
and hath made a shew of them openly,
and hath triumphed ouer them in the
same crosse. 16 Let no man therefore
condemne you in meate and drinke, or
in respect of an holy day, or of the newe
moone, or of the Sabbath dayes, 17 Which
Colossians 3:11
are but a shadowe of thinges to come:
but the body is in Christ. 18 Let no man
at his pleasure beare rule ouer you by
humblenesse of minde, and worshipping
of Angels, aduauncing himselfe in those
thinges which hee neuer sawe, rashly puft
vp with his fleshly minde, 19 And holdeth
not the head, whereof all the body fur-
nished and knit together by ioyntes and
bands, increaseth with the increasing of
God. 20 Wherefore if ye be dead with
Christ from the ordinances of the world,
why, as though ye liued in ye world, are
ye burdened with traditions? 21 As, Touch
not, Taste not, Handle not. 22 Which al
perish with the vsing, and are after the
commandements and doctrines of men.
23 Which thinges haue in deede a shewe
of wisdome, in voluntarie religion and
humblenesse of minde, and in not sparing
the body, which are thinges of no valewe,
sith they perteine to the filling of the flesh.
3
1 If yee then bee risen with Christ, seeke
those thinges which are aboue, where
Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.
2 Set your affections on things which are
aboue, and not on things which are on
the earth. 3 For ye are dead, and your
life is hid with Christ in God. 4 When
Christ which is our life, shall appeare,
then shall ye also appeare with him in
glory. 5 Mortifie therefore your members
which are on the earth, fornication, vn-
cleannes, the inordinate affection, euill
concupiscence, and couetousnes which is
idolatrie. 6 For the which things sake ye
wrath of God commeth on the children of
disobedience. 7 Wherein ye also walked
once, when ye liued in them. 8 But
now put ye away euen all these things,
wrath, anger, maliciousnes, cursed speak-
ing, filthie speaking, out of your mouth.
9 Lie not one to another, seeing that
yee haue put off the olde man with his
workes, 10 And haue put on the newe,
which is renewed in knowledge after the
image of him that created him, 11 Where
is neither Grecian nor Iewe, circumcision
nor vncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian,Colossians 3:12
1034
bond, free: But Christ is all, and in all
things. 12 Now therfore as the elect of
God holy and beloued, put on the bow-
els of mercies, kindnesse, humblenesse
of minde, meekenesse, long suffering:
13 Forbearing one another, and forgiuing
one another, if any man haue a quarel to
another: euen as Christ forgaue, euen so
doe ye. 14 And aboue all these thinges put
on loue, which is the bond of perfectnes.
15 And let the peace of God rule in your
hearts, to the which ye are called in one
body, and be ye thankfull. 16 Let the
worde of Christ dwell in you plenteously
in all wisdome, teaching and admonish-
ing your owne selues, in Psalmes, and
hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing with
a grace in your hearts to the Lord. 17 And
whatsoeuer ye shall doe, in worde or
deede, doe all in the Name of the Lord
Iesus, giuing thankes to God euen the
Father by him. 18 Wiues, submit your
selues vnto your husbands, as it is comely
in the Lord. 19 Husbands, loue your wiues,
and be not bitter vnto them. 20 Children,
obey your parents in all thing for that is
well pleasing vnto the Lord. 21 Fathers,
prouoke not your children to anger, least
22 Seruants, be

obedient vnto them that are your masters
according to the flesh, in all things, not
with eye seruice as men pleasers, but in
singlenes of heart, fearing God. 23 And
whatsoeuer ye doe, doe it heartily, as to
the Lord, and not to men, 24 Knowing that
of the Lord ye shall receiue the reward
of the inheritance: for ye serue the Lord
Christ. 25 But he that doeth wrong, shall
receiue for the wrong that he hath done:
and there is no respect of persons.
4 That

I may vtter it, as it becommeth
mee to speake. 5 Walke wisely towarde
them that are without, and redeeme the
season. 6 Let your speach be gracious
alwayes, and powdred with salt, that
ye may know how to answere euery
man. 7 Tychicus our beloued brother
and faithfull minister, and fellow seruant
in the Lord, shall declare vnto you my
whole state: 8 Whom I haue sent vnto
you for the same purpose that he might
know your state, and might comfort your
hearts, 9 With Onesimus a faithfull and
a beloued brother, who is one of you.
They shall shew you of all things here.
10 Aristarchus my prison fellow saluteth

12 Epaphras the seruant of Christ, which
is one of you, saluteth you, and alwayes
striueth for you in prayers, that ye may
stand perfect, and full in all the will of
God. 13 For I beare him record, that
he hath a great zeale for you, and for
them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis.

THE FIRST EPISTLE OF
PAUL THE APOSTLE TO
THE THESSALONIANS
1 Pavl,
and Siluanus, and Timotheus,
vnto the Church of the Thessalonians,
which is in God the Father, and in the
Lord Iesus Christ: Grace be with you, and
peace from God our Father, and from the
Lord Iesus Christ. 2 We giue God thankes
alwayes for you all, making mention of
you in our prayers 3 Without ceasing,
remembring your effectuall faith, and
diligent loue, and the patience of your
hope in our Lord Iesus Christ, in the
sight of God euen our Father, 4 Knowing,
beloued brethren, that ye are elect of God.
5 For our Gospell was not vnto you in
worde only, but also in power, and in the
holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as ye
know after what maner we were among
you for your sakes. 6 And ye became
followers of vs, and of the Lord, and
receiued the worde in much affliction,
with ioy of the holy Ghost, 7 So that ye
were as ensamples to all that beleeue in
Macedonia and in Achaia. 8 For from you
sounded out the worde of the Lord, not in
Macedonia and in Achaia only: but your
faith also which is toward God, spred
abroad in all quarters, that we neede not
to speake any thing. 9 For they themselues
shew of vs what maner of entring in we
had vnto you, and how ye turned to God
from idoles, to serue the liuing and true
God, 10 And to looke for his sonne from
heauen, whome he raised from the dead,
euen Iesus which deliuereth vs from that
wrath to come.
2
1 For ye your selues knowe, brethren,
that our entrance in vnto you was not
in vaine, 2 But euen after that we had
suffered before, and were shamefully
entreated at Philippi, (as ye knowe) we
were bolde in our God, to speake vnto you
the Gospell of God with much striuing.
3 For our exhortation was not by deceite,
1 Thessalonians 2:17
nor by vncleannes, nor by guile. 4 But
as we were allowed of God, that the
Gospel should be committed vnto vs, so
we speake, not as they that please men,
but God, which approoueth our hearts.
5 Neither yet did we euer vse flatter-
ing wordes, as ye knowe, nor coloured
couetousnes, God is recorde. 6 Neither
sought we prayse of men, neither of you,
nor of others, when we might haue bene
chargeable, as the Apostles of Christ. 7 But
we were gentle among you, euen as a
nource cherisheth her children. 8 Thus
being affectioned toward you, our good
will was to haue dealt vnto you, not
the Gospel of God onely, but also our
owne soules, because ye were deare vnto
vs. 9 For ye remember, brethren, our
labour and trauaile: for we laboured
day and night, because we would not be
chargeable vnto any of you, and preached
vnto you the Gospel of God. 10 Ye are
witnesses, and God also, how holily, and
iustly, and vnblameably we behaued our
selues among you that beleeue. 11 As ye
knowe how that we exhorted you, and
comforted, and besought euery one of
you (as a father his children) 12 That ye
would walke worthy of God, who hath
called you vnto his kingdome and glorie.
13 For this cause also thanke we God
without ceasing, that when ye receiued
the worde of God, which ye heard of
vs, ye receiued it not as the worde of
men, but as it is in deede the worde
of God, which also worketh in you that
beleeue. 14 For brethren, ye are become
folowers of the Churches of God, which
in Iudea are in Christ Iesus, because ye
haue also suffred the same things of your
owne countrey men, euen as they haue
of the Iewes, 15 Who both killed the Lord
Iesus and their owne Prophets, and haue
persecuted vs away, and God they please
not, and are contrary to all men, 16 And
forbid vs to preach vnto the Gentiles, that
they might be saued, to fulfill their sinnes
alwayes: for the wrath of God is come
on them, to the vtmost. 17 For asmuch,
brethren, as we were kept from you for
a season, concerning sight, but not in the1 Thessalonians 2:18
1036
heart, we enforced the more to see your
face with great desire. 18 Therefore we
would haue come vnto you (I Paul, at
least once or twise) but Satan hindered
vs. 19 For what is our hope or ioye, or
crowne of reioycing? are not euen you it
in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ
at his comming? 20 Yea, ye are our glory
and ioy.
3
1 Wherefore since we could no longer
forbare, wee thought it good to remaine
at Athens alone, 2 And haue sent Timo-
theus our brother and minister of God,
and our labour felow in the Gospel of
Christ, to stablish you, and to comfort
you touching your faith, 3 That no man
should be moued with these afflictions:
for ye your selues knowe, that we are
appointed thereunto. 4 For verily when
we were with you, we told you before that
we should suffer tribulations, euen as it
came to passe, and ye knowe it. 5 Euen
for this cause, when I could no longer
forbeare, I sent him that I might knowe of
your faith, lest the tempter had tempted
you in any sort, and that our labour had
bene in vaine. 6 But now lately when
Timotheus came from you vnto vs, and
brought vs good tidings of your faith and
loue, and that ye haue good remembrance
of vs alwayes, desiring to see vs, as we
also do you, 7 Therefore, brethren, we had
consolation in you, in all our affliction
and necessitie through your faith. 8 For
nowe are wee aliue, if ye stand fast in
the Lord. 9 For what thankes can wee
recompense to God againe for you, for
all the ioy wherewith we reioyce for your
sakes before our God, 10 Night and day,
praying exceedingly that wee might see
your face, and might accomplish that
which is lacking in your faith? 11 Nowe
God himselfe, euen our Father, and our
Lord Iesus Christ, guide our iourney vnto
you, 12 And the Lord increase you, and
make you abound in loue one toward
another, and towarde all men, euen as we
doe toward you: 13 To make your hearts
stable and vnblameable in holines before
1 Thessalonians 4:16
God euen our Father, at the comming of
our Lord Iesus Christ with all his Saints.
1 And
4
furthermore we beseeche you,
brethren, and exhort you in the Lord
Iesus, that ye increase more and more,
as ye haue receiued of vs, how ye ought
to walke, and to please God. 2 For ye
knowe what commandements we gaue
you by the Lord Iesus. 3 For this is the
will of God euen your sanctification, and
that ye should abstaine from fornication,
4 That euery one of you should know,
how to possesse his vessell in holines and
honour, 5 And not in the lust of con-
cupiscence, euen as the Gentiles which
know not God: 6 That no man oppresse
or defraude his brother in any matter: for
the Lord is auenger of all such thinges, as
we also haue tolde you before time, and
testified. 7 For God hath not called vs vnto
vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse. 8 Hee
therefore that despiseth these thinges,
despiseth not man, but God who hath
euen giuen you his holy Spirit. 9 But as
touching brotherly loue, ye neede not that
I write vnto you: for ye are taught of
God to loue one another. 10 Yea, and that
thing verily yee doe vnto all the brethren,
which are throughout all Macedonia: but
we beseech you, brethren, that ye in-
crease more and more, 11 And that ye
studie to be quiet, and to meddle with
your owne busines, and to worke with
your owne handes, as we commanded
you, 12 That yee may behaue your selues
honestly towarde them that are without,
and that nothing be lacking vnto you. 13 I
would not, brethren, haue you ignorant
concerning them which are a sleepe, that
ye sorow not euen as other which haue
no hope. 14 For if we beleeue that Iesus
is dead, and is risen, euen so them which
sleepe in Iesus, will God bring with him.
15 For this say we vnto you by the worde
of the Lord, that we which liue, and are
remayning in the comming of the Lord,
shall not preuent them which sleepe.
16 For the Lord himselfe shall descende
from heauen with a shoute, and with1 Thessalonians 4:17
1037
the voyce of the Archangel, and with the
trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first: 17 Then shall we which liue
and remaine, be caught vp with them also
in the clouds, to meete the Lord in the
ayre: and so shall we euer be with the
Lord. 18 Wherefore, comfort your selues
one another with these wordes.
5
1 Bvt of the times and seasons, brethren,
yee haue no neede that I write vnto you.
2 For ye your selues knowe perfectly, that
the day of the Lord shall come, euen as a
thiefe in the night. 3 For when they shall
say, Peace, and safetie, then shall come
vpon them sudden destruction, as the
trauaile vpon a woman with childe, and
they shall not escape, 4 But ye, brethren,
are not in darkenes, that that day shall
come on you, as it were a thiefe. 5 Yee are
all the children of light, and the children
of the day: we are not of the night,
neither of darkenesse. 6 Therefore let vs
not sleepe as do other, but let vs watch
and be sober. 7 For they that sleepe,
sleepe in the night, and they that be
drunken, are drunken in the night. 8 But
let vs which are of the day, be sober,
putting on the brest plate of faith and
loue, and of the hope of saluation for an
helmet. 9 For God hath not appointed
vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine saluation
by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ,
10 Which died for vs, that whether we
wake or sleepe, we should liue together
with him. 11 Wherefore exhort one an-
other, and edifie one another, euen as ye
doe. 12 Nowe we beseeche you, brethren,
that ye acknowledge them, which labour
among you, and are ouer you in the
Lord, and admonish you, 13 That yee haue
them in singular loue for their workes
sake. Bee at peace among your selues.
14 We desire you, brethren, admonish
them that are out of order: comfort ye
feeble minded: beare with the weake: be
pacient toward all men. 15 See that none
recompense euil for euil vnto any man:
but euer follow that which is good, both
toward your selues, and toward all men.
1 Thessalonians 5:28
16 Reioyce euermore. 17 Pray continually.
18 In all thinges giue thankes: for this is
the will of God in Christ Iesus toward you.
19 Quench not the Spirit. 20 Despise not
prophecying. 21 Try all things, and keepe
that which is good. 22 Absteine from all
appearance of euill. 23 Nowe the very God
of peace sanctifie you throughout: and
I pray God that your whole spirite and
soule and body, may be kept blamelesse
vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus
Christ. 24 Faithfull is hee which calleth
you, which will also doe it. 25 Brethren,
pray for vs. 26 Greete all the brethren
with an holy kisse. 27 I charge you in
the Lord, that this Epistle be read vnto all
the brethren the Saintes. 28 The grace of
our Lord Iesus Christ be with you, Amen.

THE SECOND EPISTLE
OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
TO THE THESSALONIANS
1 Paul and Siluanus, and Timotheus,
vnto the Church of the Thessalonians,
which is in God our Father, and in
the Lord Iesus Christ: 2 Grace be with
you, and peace from God our Father,
and from the Lord Iesus Christ. 3 We
ought to thanke God alwayes for you,
brethren, as it is meete, because that
your faith groweth exceedingly, and the
loue of euery one of you toward another,
aboundeth, 4 So that we our selues reioyce
of you in the Churches of God, because
of your patience and faith in al your per-
secutions and tribulatios that ye suffer,
5 Which is a manifest token of the righ-
teous iudgement of God, that ye may be
counted worthy of the kingdome of God,
for the which ye also suffer. 6 For it is a
righteous thing with God, to recompense
tribulation to them that trouble you, 7 And
to you which are troubled, rest with vs,
when the Lord Iesus shall shewe himselfe
from heauen with his mightie Angels,
8 In flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto
them, that doe not know God, and which
obey not vnto the Gospel of our Lord Iesus
Christ, 9 Which shall be punished with eu-
erlasting perdition, from the presence of
the Lord, and from the glory of his power,
10 When he shall come to be glorified in
his Saints, and to be made marueilous
in all them that beleeue (because our
testimonie toward you was beleeued) in
that day. 11 Wherefore, we also pray
alwayes for you, that our God may make
you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all
the good pleasure of his goodnes, and the
worke of faith with power, 12 That the
Name of our Lord Iesus Christ may be
glorified in you, and ye in him, according
to the grace of our God, and of the Lord
Iesus Christ.
1 Now
2
we beseech you, brethren, by
the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ,
2 Thessalonians 2:17
and by our assembling vnto him, 2 That
ye be not suddenly mooued from your
minde, nor troubled neither by spirit, nor
by worde, nor by letter, as it were from vs,
as though the day of Christ were at hand.
3 Let no man deceiue you by any meanes:
for that day shall not come, except there
come a departing first, and that that man
of sinne be disclosed, euen the sonne
of perdition, 4 Which is an aduersarie,
and exalteth him selfe against all that
is called God, or that is worshipped: so
that he doeth sit as God in the Temple
of God, shewing him selfe that he is God.
5 Remember ye not, that when I was yet
with you, I tolde you these things? 6 And
nowe ye knowe what withholdeth that he
might be reueiled in his time. 7 For the
mysterie of iniquitie doeth already worke:
onely he which nowe withholdeth, shall
let till he be taken out of the way. 8 And
then shall that wicked man be reueiled,
whome the Lord shall consume with the
Spirit of his mouth, and shall abolish
with the brightnes of his comming, 9 Euen
him whose comming is by the effectuall
working of Satan, with all power, and
signes, and lying wonders, 10 And in al
deceiuablenes of vnrighteousnes, among
them that perish, because they receiued
not the loue of the trueth, that they
might be saued. 11 And therefore God
shall send them strong delusion, that
they should beleeue lies, 12 That all they
might be damned which beleeued not
the trueth, but had pleasure in vnrigh-
teousnes. 13 But we ought to giue thankes
alway to God for you, brethren beloued
of the Lord, because that God hath from
the beginning chosen you to saluation,
through sanctification of the Spirit, and
the faith of trueth, 14 Whereunto he called
you by our Gospel, to obtaine the glory
of our Lord Iesus Christ. 15 Therefore,
brethren, stand fast and keepe the in-
structions, which ye haue bene taught,
either by worde, or by our Epistle. 16 Now
the same Iesus Christ our Lord; and our
God euen the Father which hath loued vs,
and hath giuen vs euerlasting consolation
and good hope through grace, 17 Comfort2 Thessalonians 3:1
1039
2 Thessalonians 3:18
your hearts, and stablish you in euery is ye token in euery Epistle: so I write,
18 The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be
word and good worke.
with you all, Amen. ‘The second Epistle to
the Thessalonians, written from Athens.’
1 Furthermore,
3
brethren, pray for vs,
that the worde of the Lord may haue
free passage and be glorified, euen as
it is with you, 2 And that we may be
deliuered from vnreasonable and euill
men: for all men haue not fayth. 3 But
the Lord is faithfull, which wil stablish
you, and keepe you from euill. 4 And
we are perswaded of you through the
Lord, that ye both doe, and will doe the
things which we warne you of. 5 And
the Lord guide your hearts to the loue
of God, and the waiting for of Christ.
6 We warne you, brethren, in the Name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, that ye with-
drawe your selues from euery brother
that walketh inordinately, and not after
the instruction, which hee receiued of vs.
7 For ye your selues know, how ye ought
to follow vs: for we behaued not our
selues inordinately among you, 8 Neither
tooke we bread of any man for nought:
but we wrought with labour and trauaile
night and day, because we would not be
chargeable to any of you. 9 Not because
we haue not authoritie, but that we might
make our selues an ensample vnto you
to follow vs. 10 For euen when we were
with you, this we warned you of, that if
there were any, which would not worke,
that he should not eate. 11 For we heare,
that there are some which walke among
you inordinately, and worke not at all,
but are busie bodies. 12 Therefore them
that are such, we warne and exhort by
our Lord Iesus Christ, that they worke
with quietnes, and eate their owne bread.
13 And ye, brethren, be not weary in well
doing. 14 If any man obey not this our
saying in this letter, note him, and haue
no company with him, that he may be
ashamed: 15 Yet count him not as an
enemie, but admonish him as a brother.
16 Now the Lord himselfe of peace giue
you peace alwayes by all meanes. The
Lord be with you all. 17 The salutation
of me Paul, with mine owne hand, which1 Timothy 1:1
1040
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF
PAUL THE APOSTLE TO
TIMOTHY
1 Pavl
an Apostle of Iesvs Christ, by
the commandement of God our Sauiour,
and of our Lord Iesus Christ our hope,
2 Vnto Timotheus my naturall sonne in
the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from
God our Father, and from Christ Iesus
our Lord. 3 As I besought thee to abide
still in Ephesus, when I departed into
Macedonia, so doe, that thou mayest
warne some, that they teach none other
doctrine, 4 Neither that they giue heede to
fables and genealogies which are endles,
which breede questions rather then godly
edifying which is by fayth. 5 For the
end of the commandement is loue out of
a pure heart, and of a good conscience,
and of faith vnfained. 6 From the which
things some haue erred, and haue turned
vnto vaine iangling. 7 They would be
doctours of the Law, and yet vnderstande
not what they speake, neither whereof
they affirme. 8 And we knowe, that the
Law is good, if a man vse it lawfully,
9 Knowing this, that the Lawe is not
giuen vnto a righteous man, but vnto the
lawles and disobedient, to the vngodly,
and to sinners, to the vnholy, and to
the prophane, to murtherers of fathers
and mothers, to manslayers, 10 To whore-
mongers, to buggerers, to menstealers, to
lyers, to the periured, and if there be any
other thing, that is contrary to wholesome
doctrine, 11 Which is according to the glo-
rious Gospel of the blessed God, which is
committed vnto me. 12 Therefore I thanke
him, which hath made me strong, that
is, Christ Iesus our Lord: for he counted
me faithfull, and put me in his seruice:
13 When before I was a blasphemer, and
a persecuter, and an oppresser: but I was
receiued to mercie: for I did it ignorantly
through vnbeliefe. 14 But the grace of
our Lord was exceeding abundant with
faith and loue, which is in Christ Iesus.
15 This is a true saying, and by all meanes
1 Timothy 2:12
worthy to be receiued, that Christ Iesus
came into the worlde to saue sinners, of
whom I am chiefe. 16 Notwithstanding,
for this cause was I receiued to mer-
cie, that Iesus Christ should first shewe
on me all long suffering vnto the en-
sample of them, which shall in time
to come beleeue in him vnto eternall
life. 17 Nowe vnto the King euerlasting,
immortall, inuisible, vnto God onely wise,
be honour and glorie, for euer, and euer,
Amen. 18 This commandement commit
I vnto thee, sonne Timotheus, according
to the prophecies, which went before
vpon thee, that thou by them shouldest
fight a good fight, 19 Hauing faith and a
good conscience, which some haue put
away, and as concerning faith, haue made
shipwracke. 20 Of whom is Hymeneus,
and Alexander, whom I haue deliuered
vnto Satan, that they might learne not to
blaspheme.
1 I
2
Exhort therefore, that first of all
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and
giuing of thanks be made for all men, 2 For
Kings, and for all that are in authoritie,
that we may leade a quiet and a peaceable
life, in all godlinesse and honestie. 3 For
this is good and acceptable in the sight
of God our Sauiour, 4 Who will that all
men shalbe saued, and come vnto the
acknowledging of the trueth. 5 For there
is one God, and one Mediatour betweene
God and man, which is the man Christ
Iesus, 6 Who gaue himselfe a ransome for
all men, to be that testimonie in due time,
7 Whereunto I am ordeined a preacher
and an Apostle (I speake the trueth in
Christ, and lie not) euen a teacher of
the Gentiles in faith and veritie. 8 I will
therefore that the men pray, euery where
lifting vp pure hands without wrath, or
douting. 9 Likewise also the women, that
they aray themselues in comely appar-
ell, with shamefastnes and modestie, not
with broyded heare, or gold, or pearles,
or costly apparell, 10 But (as becommeth
women that professe the feare of God)
with good workes. 11 Let the woman
learne in silence with all subiection. 12 I1 Timothy 2:13
1041
permit not a woman to teache, neither to
vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be
in silence. 13 For Adam was first formed,
then Eue. 14 And Adam was not deceiued,
but the woman was deceiued, and was
in the transgression. 15 Notwithstanding,
through bearing of children she shalbe
saued if they continue in faith, and loue,
and holines with modestie.
1 This
3
is a true saying, If any man
desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth
a worthie worke. 2 A Bishop therefore
must be vnreproueable, the husband of
one wife, watching, temperate, modest,
harberous, apt to teache, 3 Not giuen to
wine, no striker, not giuen to filthy lucre,
but gentle, no fighter, not couetous, 4 One
that can rule his owne house honestly,
hauing children vnder obedience with all
honestie. 5 For if any cannot rule his owne
house, how shall he care for the Church
of God? 6 He may not be a yong scholer,
lest he being puffed vp fall into the con-
demnation of the deuill. 7 He must also
be well reported of, euen of them which
are without, lest he fall into rebuke, and
the snare of the deuill. 8 Likewise must
Deacons be graue, not double tongued,
not giuen vnto much wine, neither to
filthy lucre, 9 Hauing the mysterie of the
faith in pure conscience. 10 And let them
first be proued: then let them minister, if
they be found blameles. 11 Likewise their
wiues must be honest, not euill speakers,
but sober, and faithfull in all things. 12 Let
the Deacons be the husbands of one wife,
and such as can rule their children well,
and their owne housholdes. 13 For they
that haue ministred well, get them selues
a good degree, and great libertie in the
faith, which is in Christ Iesus. 14 These
things write I vnto thee, trusting to come
very shortly vnto thee. 15 But if I tary
long, that thou maist yet know, how thou
oughtest to behaue thy self in ye house
of God, which is the Church of the liuing
God, the pillar and ground of trueth.
16 And without controuersie, great is the
mysterie of godlinesse, which is, God is
1 Timothy 4:16
manifested in the flesh, iustified in the
Spirit, seene of Angels, preached vnto the
Gentiles, beleeued on in the world, and
receiued vp in glorie.
1 Now
4
the Spirit speaketh euidently,
that in the latter times some shall depart
from the faith, and shall giue heede vnto
spirits of errour, and doctrines of deuils,
2 Which speake lies through hypocrisie,
and haue their cosciences burned with
an hote yron, 3 Forbidding to mar-
rie, and commanding to abstaine from
meates which God hath created to be re-
ceiued with giuing thankes of them which
beleeue and knowe the trueth. 4 For euery
creature of God is good, and nothing
ought to be refused, if it be receiued with
thankesgiuing. 5 For it is sanctified by
the worde of God, and prayer. 6 If thou
put the brethren in remembrance of these
things, thou shalt be a good minister of
Iesus Christ, which hast bene nourished
vp in the wordes of faith, and of good
doctrine, which thou hast continually
followed. 7 But cast away prophane, and
olde wiues fables, and exercise thy selfe
vnto godlinesse. 8 For bodily exercise
profiteth litle: but godlinesse is profitable
vnto all things, which hath the promise
of the life present, and of that that is to
come. 9 This is a true saying, and by all
meanes worthie to be receiued. 10 For
therefore we labour and are rebuked,
because we trust in the liuing God, which
is the Sauiour of all men, specially of
those that beleeue. 11 These things warne
and teache. 12 Let no man despise thy
youth, but be vnto them that beleeue, an
ensample, in worde, in conuersation, in
loue, in spirit, in faith, and in purenesse.
13 Till I come, giue attendance to reading,
to exhortation, and to doctrine. 14 Despise
not the gift that is in thee, which was
giuen thee by prophecie with the laying
on of the hands of the companie of the
Eldership. 15 These things exercise, and
giue thy selfe vnto them, that it may be
seene howe thou profitest among all men.
16 Take heede vnto thy selfe, and vnto1 Timothy 5:1

is certaine, that we can carie nothing out.
8 Therefore when wee haue foode and
raiment, let vs therewith be content. 9 For
they that will be rich, fall into tentation
and snares, and into many foolish and
noysome lustes, which drowne men in
perdition and destruction. 10 For the
desire of money is the roote of all euill,
which while some lusted after, they erred
from the faith, and pearced themselues
through with many sorowes. 11 But thou,
O man of God, flee these things, and fol-

loue, patience, and meekenes. 12 Fight the

tius Pilate witnessed a good confession,
14 That thou keepe this commandement

THE SECOND EPISTLE
OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
TO TIMOTHY
1 Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by the
will of God, according to the promise of
life which is in Christ Iesus, 2 To Timo-
theus my beloued sonne: Grace, mercie
and peace from God the Father, and from
Iesus Christ our Lord. 3 I thanke God,
whom I serue from mine elders with pure
conscience, that without ceasing I haue
remembrance of thee in my praiers night
and day, 4 Desiring to see thee, mindefull
of thy teares, that I may be filled with
ioy: 5 When I call to remembrance the
vnfained faith that is in thee, which dwelt
first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy
mother Eunice, and am assured that it
dwelleth in thee also. 6 Wherefore, I
put thee in remembrance that thou stirre
vp the gift of God which is in thee, by
the putting on of mine hands. 7 For
God hath not giuen to vs the Spirite of
feare, but of power, and of loue, and of a
sound minde. 8 Be not therefore ashamed
of the testimonie of our Lord, neither
of me his prisoner: but be partaker of
the afflictions of the Gospel, according to
the power of God, 9 Who hath saued vs,
and called vs with an holy calling, not
according to our workes, but according to
his owne purpose and grace, which was
giuen to vs through Christ Iesus before the
world was, 10 But is nowe made manifest
by that appearing of our Sauiour Iesus
Christ, who hath abolished death, and
hath brought life and immortalitie vnto
light through the Gospel. 11 Whereunto
I am appointed a preacher, and Apostle,
and a teacher of the Gentiles. 12 For the
which cause I also suffer these things, but
I am not ashamed: for I knowe whom
I haue beleeued, and I am persuaded
that he is able to keepe that which I
haue committed to him against that day.
13 Keepe the true paterne of the whole-
some wordes, which thou hast heard of
me in faith and loue which is in Christ
2 Timothy 2:14
Iesus. 14 That worthie thing, which was
committed to thee, keepe through the
holy Ghost, which dwelleth in vs. 15 This
thou knowest, that all they which are in
Asia, be turned from me: of which sort
are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 16 The
Lord giue mercie vnto the house of One-
siphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and
was not ashamed of my chaine, 17 But
when he was at Rome, he sought me out
very diligently, and found me. 18 The
Lord graunt vnto him, that he may finde
mercie with the Lord at that day, and in
how many things he hath ministred vnto
me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2
1 Thou therefore, my sonne, be strong
in the grace that is in Christ Iesus. 2 And
what things thou hast heard of me, by
many witnesses, ye same deliuer to faith-
full men, which shalbe able to teache
other also. 3 Thou therefore suffer afflic-
tion as a good souldier of Iesus Christ.
4 No man that warreth, entangleth him-
selfe with the affaires of this life, because
he woulde please him that hath chosen
him to be a souldier. 5 And if any man also
striue for a Masterie, he is not crowned,
except he striue as he ought to doe.
6 The husbandman must labour before he
receiue the fruites. 7 Consider what I say:
and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in
all things: 8 Remember that Iesus Christ,
made of the seede of Dauid, was raysed
againe from the dead according to my
Gospel, 9 Wherein I suffer trouble as an
euill doer, euen vnto bondes: but the
worde of God is not bounde. 10 Therefore
I suffer all things, for the elects sake,
that they might also obtaine the saluation
which is in Christ Iesus, with eternall
glorie. 11 It is a true saying, For if we
be dead together with him, we also shall
liue together with him. 12 If we suffer,
we shall also reigne together with him: if
we denie him, he also will denie vs. 13 If
we beleeue not, yet abideth he faithfull:
he cannot denie himselfe. 14 Of these
things put them in remembrance, and
protest before the Lord, that they striue2 Timothy 2:15
1045
not about wordes, which is to no profit,
but to the peruerting of the hearers.
15 Studie to shewe thy selfe approued
vnto God, a workeman that needeth not
to be ashamed, diuiding the worde of
trueth aright. 16 Stay prophane, and vaine
babblings: for they shall encrease vnto
more vngodlinesse. 17 And their worde
shall fret as a canker: of which sort
is Hymeneus and Philetus, 18 Which as
concerning ye trueth haue erred from
the marke, saying that the resurrection
is past alreadie, and do destroy the faith
of certaine. 19 But the foundation of God
remaineth sure, and hath this seale, The
Lord knoweth who are his: and, Let euery
one that calleth on the Name of Christ,
depart from iniquitie. 20 Notwithstanding
in a great house are not onely vessels of
gold and of siluer, but also of wood and
of earth, and some for honour, and some
vnto dishonour. 21 If any man therefore
purge him selfe from these, he shalbe a
vessell vnto honour, sanctified, and meete
for the Lord, and prepared vnto euery
good worke. 22 Flee also from the lustes
of youth, and follow after righteousnes,
faith, loue, and peace, with them that call
on the Lord with pure heart, 23 And put
away foolish and vnlearned questions,
knowing that they ingender strife. 24 But
the seruant of ye Lord must not striue,
but must be gentle toward all men, apt to
teache, suffering the euill, 25 Instructing
them with meekenesse that are contrary
minded, prouing if God at any time will
giue them repentance, that they may
acknowledge the trueth, 26 And come to
amendment out of that snare of the deuil,
of whom they are taken prisoners, to doe
his will.
3
This knowe also, that in the last
dayes shall come perilous times. 2 For
men shalbe louers of their owne selues,
couetous, boasters, proud, cursed speak-
ers, disobedient to parents, vnthankefull,
vnholy, 3 Without naturall affection, truce
breakers, false accusers, intemperate,
fierce, no louers at all of them which are
1
2 Timothy 4:3
good, 4 Traitours, headie, high minded,
louers of pleasures more then louers of
God, 5 Hauing a shewe of godlinesse, but
haue denied the power thereof: turne
away therefore from such. 6 For of this
sort are they which creepe into houses,
and leade captiue simple women laden
with sinnes, and led with diuers lustes,
7 Which women are euer learning, and
are neuer able to come to the acknowl-
edging of the trueth. 8 And as Iannes and
Iambres withstoode Moses, so doe these
also resist the trueth, men of corrupt
mindes, reprobate concerning the faith.
9 But they shall preuaile no longer: for
their madnesse shalbe euident vnto all
men, as theirs also was. 10 But thou
hast fully knowen my doctrine, maner of
liuing, purpose, faith, long suffering, loue,
patience, 11 Persecutions, and afflictions
which came vnto me at Antiochia, at Ico-
nium, and at Lystri, which persecutions
I suffered: but from them all the Lord
deliuered me. 12 Yea, and all that will
liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer
persecution. 13 But the euill men and
deceiuers, shall waxe worse and worse,
deceiuing, and being deceiued. 14 But con-
tinue thou in the thinges which thou hast
learned, and which are committed vnto
thee, knowing of who thou hast learned
them: 15 And that thou hast knowen the
holy Scriptures of a childe, which are
able to make thee wise vnto saluation,
through the faith which is in Christ Iesus.
16 For the whole Scripture is giuen by
inspiration of God, and is profitable to
teache, to conuince, to correct, and to
instruct in righteousnesse, 17 That the
man of God may be absolute, being made
perfect vnto all good workes.

get them an heape of teachers, 4 And shall
turne their eares from the trueth, and
shalbe giuen vnto fables. 5 But watch
thou in all thinges: suffer aduersitie:
doe the worke of an Euangelist: cause
thy ministerie to be throughly liked of.
6 For I am nowe readie to be offered,
and the time of my departing is at hand.
7 I haue fought a good fight, and haue
finished my course: I haue kept the faith.
8 For hence foorth is laide vp for me the
crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord
the righteous iudge shall giue me at that
day: and not to me onely, but vnto all
them also that loue that his appearing.
9 Make speede to come vnto me at once:
10 For Demas hath forsaken me, and
hath embraced this present world, and
is departed vnto Thessalonica. Crescens
is gone to Galatia, Titus vnto Dalmatia.
11 Onely Luke is with me. Take Marke
and bring him with thee: for he is
profitable vnto me to minister. 12 And
Tychicus haue I sent to Ephesus. 13 The
cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus,
when thou commest, bring with thee, and
the bookes, but specially the parchments.
14 Alexander the coppersmith hath done
me much euill: the Lord rewarde him
according to his workes. 15 Of whome
be thou ware also: for he withstoode our
preaching sore. 16 At my first answering
no man assisted me, but all forsooke me:
I pray God, that it may not be laide to
their charge. 17 Notwithstanding the Lord
assisted me, and strengthened me, that by
me the preaching might be fully beleeued,
and that al the Gentiles should heare:
and I was deliuered out of the mouth of
the lion. 18 And the Lord will deliuer
me from euery euil worke, and will
preserue me vnto his heauenly kingdome:
to whome be praise for euer and euer,

THE EPISTLE OF PAUL
THE APOSTLE TO THE
HEBREWS
1 At sundry times and in diuers man-
ers God spake in the olde time to our
fathers by the Prophetes: in these last
dayes hee hath spoken vnto vs by his
Sonne, 2 Whom he hath made heire of
al things, by whome also he made the
worldes, 3 Who being the brightnes of
the glory, and the ingraued forme of his
person, and bearing vp all things by his
mightie worde, hath by himselfe purged
our sinnes, and sitteth at the right hand
of the Maiestie in the highest places, 4 And
is made so much more excellent then the
Angels, in as much as hee hath obteined
a more excellent Name then they. 5 For
vnto which of the Angels saide he at any
time, Thou art my Sonne, this day begate I
thee? and againe, I will be his Father, and
he shalbe my Sonne? 6 And againe, when
he bringeth in his first begotten Sonne
into the worlde, hee saith, And let all the
Angels of God worship him. 7 And of the
Angels he saith, He maketh the spirites
his messengers, and his ministers a flame
of fire. 8 But vnto the Sonne he saith,
O God, thy throne is for euer and euer:
the scepter of thy kingdome is a scepter
of righteousnes. 9 Thou hast loued righ-
teousnes and hated iniquitie. Wherefore
God, eue thy God, hath anointed thee with
the oyle of gladnes aboue thy fellowes.
10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast
established the earth, and the heauens
are the workes of thine handes. 11 They
shall perish, but thou doest remaine:
and they all shall waxe olde as doeth a
garment. 12 And as a vesture shalt thou
folde them vp, and they shall be changed:
but thou art the same, and thy yeeres
shall not faile. 13 Vnto which also of the
Angels saide he at any time, Sit at my
right hand, til I make thine enemies thy
footestoole? 14 Are they not al ministring
spirits, sent forth to minister, for their
sakes which shalbe heires of saluation?
Hebrews 2:14
1 Wherefore
2
wee ought diligently to
giue heede to the thinges which wee haue
heard, lest at any time we runne out.
2 For if the worde spoken by Angels was
stedfast, and euery transgression, and
disobedience receiued a iust recompence
of reward, 3 How shall we escape, if we
neglect so great saluation, which at the
first began to be preached by the Lord,
and afterward was confirmed vnto vs
by them that heard him, 4 God bearing
witnes thereto, both with signes and
wonders, and with diuers miracles, and
gifts of the holy Ghost, according to his
owne will? 5 For he hath not put in
subiection vnto the Angels the world to
come, whereof we speake. 6 But one in
a certaine place witnessed, saying, What
is man, that thou shouldest bee mindefull
of him? or the sonne of man, that thou
wouldest consider him? 7 Thou madest
him a litle inferiour to ye Angels: thou
crownedst him with glory and honour,
and hast set him aboue the workes of
thine hands. 8 Thou hast put all things
in subiection vnder his feete. And in
that he hath put all things in subiection
vnder him, he left nothing that should
not be subiect vnto him. But we yet see
not all things subdued vnto him, 9 But
we see Iesus crowned with glory and
honour, which was made litle inferiour
to the Angels, through the suffering of
death, that by Gods grace he might taste
death for all men. 10 For it became him,
for whome are all these thinges, and by
whome are all these things, seeing that
hee brought many children vnto glory,
that he should consecrate the Prince of
their saluation through afflictions. 11 For
he that sanctifieth, and they which are
sanctified, are all of one: wherefore he
is not ashamed to call them brethren,
12 Saying, I will declare thy Name vnto
my brethren: in the middes of the Church
will I sing praises to thee. 13 And againe,
I will put my trust in him. And againe,
Beholde, here am I, and the children
which God hath giuen me. 14 Forasmuch
then as the children are partakers of flesh
and blood, he also himselfe likewise tookeHebrews 2:15
1051
part with them, that hee might destroye
through death, him that had the power
of death, that is the deuil, 15 And that he
might deliuer all them, which for feare of
death were all their life time subiect to
bondage. 16 For he in no sort tooke on
him the Angels nature, but hee tooke on
him the seede of Abraham. 17 Wherefore
in all things it behoued him to be made
like vnto his brethren, that hee might
be mercifull, and a faithfull hie Priest
in things concerning God, that he might
make reconciliation for the sinnes of the
people. 18 For in that he suffered, and was
tempted, he is able to succour them that
are tempted.

not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
17 But with whome was he displeased
fourtie yeeres? Was hee not displeased
with them that sinned, whose carkeises
fell in the wildernes? 18 And to whom
sware he that they should not enter into

of the ioints, and the marow, and is
a discerner of the thoughtes, and the
intents of the heart. 13 Neither is there
any creature, which is not manifest in his
sight: but all things are naked and open
vnto his eyes, with whome we haue to

in things pertaining to God, that he may
offer both giftes and sacrifices for sinnes,
2 Which is able sufficiently to haue com-
passion on them that are ignorant, and
that are out of the way, because that hee
also is compassed with infirmitie, 3 And
for the sames sake he is bound to offer
for sinnes, as well for his own part, as
for ye peoples. 4 And no man taketh
this honor vnto him selfe, but he that is
called of God, as was Aaron. 5 So likewise
Christ tooke not to him selfe this honour,
to be made the hie Priest, but hee that
sayd vnto him, Thou art my Sonne, this
day begate I thee, gaue it him. 6 As he
also in another place speaketh, Thou art
a Priest for euer, after ye order of Melchi-
sedec. 7 Who in the dayes of his flesh did
offer vp prayers and supplications, with
strong crying and teares vnto him, that
was able to saue him from death, and was
also heard in that which he feared. 8 And
though he were ye Sonne, yet learned
he obedience, by the things which he
Hebrews 6:10
suffered. 9 And being consecrate, was
made the authour of eternall saluation
vnto all them that obey him: 10 And is
called of God an hie Priest after the order
of Melchi-sedec. 11 Of whome we haue
many things to say, which are hard to be
vttered, because ye are dull of hearing.
12 For when as concerning ye time ye
ought to be teachers, yet haue ye neede
againe that we teach you what are the
first principles of the worde of God: and
are become such as haue neede of milke,
and not of strong meate. 13 For euery one
that vseth milke, is inexpert in the worde
of righteousnes: for he is a babe. 14 But
strong meate belongeth to them that are
of age, which through long custome haue
their wits exercised, to discerne both good
and euill.
6
1 Therefore, leauing the doctrine of the
beginning of Christ, let vs be led for-
ward vnto perfection, not laying againe
ye foundation of repetance from dead
workes, and of faith toward God, 2 Of the
doctrine of baptismes, and laying on of
hands, and of the resurrection from the
dead, and of eternall iudgement. 3 And
this will we doe if God permit. 4 For
it is impossible that they which were
once lightened, and haue tasted of the
heauenly gift, and were made partakers
of the holy Ghost, 5 And haue tasted of
the good word of God, and of the powers
of the world to come, 6 If they fal away,
should be renued againe by repentance:
seeing they crucifie againe to themselues
the Sonne of God, and make a mocke of
him. 7 For the earth which drinketh in
the raine that commeth oft vpon it, and
bringeth foorth herbes meete for them by
whome it is dressed, receiueth blessing
of God. 8 But that which beareth thornes
and briars, is reproued, and is neere vnto
cursing, whose end is to be burned. 9 But
beloued, we haue perswaded our selues
better things of you, and such as accom-
pany saluation, though we thus speake.
10 For God is not vnrighteous, that hee
should forget your worke, and labour of
loue, which ye shewed toward his Name,Hebrews 6:11
1053
in that ye haue ministred vnto the Saints,
and yet minister. 11 And we desire that
euery one of you shew the same diligence,
to the full assurance of hope vnto the
ende, 12 That ye be not slouthfull, but fol-
lowers of them, which through faith and
patience, inherite the promises. 13 For
when God made the promise to Abraham,
because he had no greater to sweare by,
he sware by himselfe, 14 Saying, Surely
I wil aboundantly blesse thee and mul-
tiplie thee marueilously. 15 And so after
that he had taried patiently, he enioyed
the promise. 16 For men verely sweare
by him that is greater then themselues,
and an othe for confirmation is among
them an ende of all strife. 17 So God,
willing more aboundantly to shew vnto
the heires of promise the stablenes of
his counsell, bound himselfe by an othe,
18 That by two immutable things, wherein
it is vnpossible that God should lye, we
might haue strong consolation, which
haue our refuge to lay holde vpon that
hope that is set before vs, 19 Which hope
we haue, as an ancre of the soule, both
sure and stedfast, and it entreth into that
which is within the vaile, 20 Whither the
forerunner is for vs entred in, euen Iesus
that is made an hie Priest for euer after
the order of Melchi-sedec.
1 For
7
this Melchi-sedec was King of
Salem, the Priest of the most high God,
who met Abraham, as he returned from
the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed
him: 2 To whom also Abraham gaue
the tithe of all things: who first is by
interpretation King of righteousnes: after
that, he is also King of Salem, that is,
King of peace, 3 Without father, without
mother, without kinred, and hath neither
beginning of his dayes, neither ende of
life: but is likened vnto the Sonne of
God, and continueth a Priest for euer.
4 Nowe consider how great this man was,
vnto whome euen the Patriarke Abraham
5 For
gaue the tithe of the spoyles.
verely they which are the childre of Leui,
which receiue the office of the Priesthode,
haue a commandement to take, according
Hebrews 7:23
to the Law, tithes of the people (that
is, of their bethren) though they came
out of ye loynes of Abraham. 6 But he
whose kindred is not couted among them,
receiued tithes of Abraham, and blessed
him that had the promises. 7 And without
all contradiction the lesse is blessed of
the greater. 8 And here men that die,
receiue tithes: but there he receiueth
them, of whome it is witnessed, that he
liueth. 9 And to say as the thing is,
Leui also which receiueth tithes, payed
tithes in Abraham. 10 For hee was yet in
the loynes of his father Abraham, when
Melchi-sedec met him. 11 If therefore
perfection had bene by the Priesthoode
of the Leuites (for vnder it the Lawe was
established to the people) what needed it
furthermore, that another Priest should
rise after the order of Melchi-sedec, and
not to be called after the order of Aaron?
12 For if the Priesthood be changed, then
of necessitie must there be a change of
the Lawe. 13 For hee of whome these
things are spoken, perteineth vnto an-
other tribe, whereof no man serued at the
altar. 14 For it is euident, that our Lord
sprung out of Iuda, concerning the which
tribe Moses spake nothing, touching the
Priesthood. 15 And it is yet a more euident
thing, because that after the similitude of
Melchi-sedec, there is risen vp another
Priest, 16 Which is not made Priest after
the Law of the carnal commandement,
but after the power of the endlesse life.
17 For hee testifieth thus, Thou art a
Priest for euer, after the order of Melchi-
sedec. 18 For the commandement that
went afore, is disanulled, because of the
weakenes thereof, and vnprofitablenes.
19 For the Law made nothing perfite, but
the bringing in of a better hope made
perfite, whereby we drawe neere vnto
God. 20 And for as much as it is not with-
out an othe (for these are made Priestes
without an othe: 21 But this is made with
an othe by him that said vnto him, The
Lord hath sworne, and will not repent,
Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order
of Melchi-sedec) 22 By so much is Iesus
made a suretie of a better Testament.
23 And among them many were made
Priests, because they were not suffered toHebrews 7:24
1054
endure, by the reason of death. 24 But this
man, because hee endureth euer, hath a
Priesthood, which cannot passe from one
to another. 25 Wherefore, hee is able also
perfectly to saue them that come vnto God
by him, seeing he euer liueth, to make
intercession for them. 26 For such an
hie Priest it became vs to haue, which
is holy, harmelesse, vndefiled, separate
from sinners, and made hier then the
heauens: 27 Which needeth not daily as
those hie Priests to offer vp sacrifice,
first for his owne sinnes, and then for
the peoples: for that did he once, when
he offered vp himselfe. 28 For the Law
maketh men hie Priestes, which haue
infirmitie: but the word of the othe that
was since the Lawe, maketh the Sonne,
who is consecrated for euermore.
1 Nowe
8
of the things which we haue
spoken, this is the summe, that wee haue
such an hie Priest, that sitteth at the
right hand of the throne of the Maiestie
in heauens, 2 And is a minister of the
Sanctuarie, and of that true Tabernacle
which the Lord pight, and not man. 3 For
euery high Priest is ordeined to offer both
giftes and sacrifices: wherefore it was
of necessitie, that this man shoulde haue
somewhat also to offer. 4 For he were not
a Priest, if he were on the earth, seeing
there are Priestes that according to the
Lawe offer giftes, 5 Who serue vnto the
paterne and shadowe of heauenly things,
as Moses was warned by God, whe he was
about to finish the Tabernacle. See, saide
hee, that thou make all thinges according
to the paterne, shewed to thee in the
mount. 6 But nowe our hie Priest hath
obteined a more excellent office, in as
much as he is the Mediatour of a better
Testament, which is established vpon bet-
ter promises. 7 For if that first Testament
had bene vnblameable, no place should
haue bene sought for the second. 8 For
in rebuking them he saith, Beholde, the
dayes will come, saith the Lord, when I
shall make with the house of Israel, and
with the house of Iuda a newe Testament:
9 Not like the Testament that I made with
their fathers, in the day that I tooke them
Hebrews 9:9
by the hand, to leade them out of the
land of Egypt: for they continued not
in my Testament, and I regarded them
not, saith the Lord. 10 For this is the
Testament that I will make with the house
of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord,
I will put my Lawes in their minde, and
in their heart I will write them, and I
wil be their God, and they shalbe my
people, 11 And they shall not teache euery
man his neighbour and euery man his
brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all
shall knowe me, from the least of them
to the greatest of them. 12 For I will
bee mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and
I wil remember their sinnes and their
iniquities no more. 13 In that he saith
a new Testament, he hath abrogate the
olde: nowe that which is disanulled and
waxed olde, is ready to vanish away.
9
1 Then the first Testament had also ordi-
nances of religion, and a worldly Sanctu-
arie. 2 For the first Tabernacle was made,
wherein was the candlesticke, and the
table, and the shewebread, which Taber-
nacle is called the Holy places. 3 And after
the seconde vaile was the Tabernacle,
which is called the Holiest of all, 4 Which
had the golden censer, and the Arke of the
Testament ouerlayde rounde about with
golde, wherein the golden pot, which had
Manna, was, and Aarons rod that had
budded, and the tables of the Testament.
5 And ouer the Arke were the glorious
Cherubims, shadowing the mercie seat:
of which things we will not nowe speake
particularly. 6 Nowe when these things
were thus ordeined, the Priestes went
alwayes into the first Tabernacle, and
7 But into
accomplished the seruice.
the second went the hie Priest alone,
once euery yere, not without blood which
hee offered for himselfe, and for the
ignorances of the people. 8 Whereby the
holy Ghost this signified, that the way
into ye Holiest of all was not yet opened,
while as yet the first tabernacle was
standing, 9 Which was a figure for that
present time, wherein were offred gifts
and sacrifices that could not make holy,Hebrews 9:10
1055
concerning the conscience, him that did
the seruice, 10 Which only stood in meates
and drinkes, and diuers washings, and
carnal rites, which were inioyned, vntill
the time of reformation. 11 But Christ
being come an high Priest of good things
to come, by a greater and a more perfect
Tabernacle, not made with handes, that
is, not of this building, 12 Neither by the
blood of goates and calues: but by his
owne blood entred he in once vnto the
holy place, and obteined eternall redemp-
tion for vs. 13 For if the blood of bulles
and of goates, and the ashes of an heifer,
sprinkling them that are vncleane, sanc-
tifieth as touching the purifying of the
flesh, 14 How much more shall the blood
of Christ which through the eternall Spirit
offered himselfe without fault to God,
purge your conscience from dead workes,
to serue the liuing God? 15 And for this
cause is he the Mediatour of the newe Tes-
tament, that through death which was for
the redemption of the transgressions that
were in the former Testament, they which
were called, might receiue the promise
of eternall inheritance. 16 For where a
Testament is, there must be the death of
him that made the Testament. 17 For the
Testament is confirmed when men are
dead: for it is yet of no force as long as
he that made it, is aliue. 18 Wherefore
neither was the first ordeined without
blood. 19 For when Moses had spoken
euery precept to the people, according to
the Law, he tooke the blood of calues and
of goates, with water and purple wooll
and hyssope, and sprinckled both the
booke, and all the people, 20 Saying, This
is the blood of the Testament, which God
hath appointed vnto you. 21 Moreouer,
he sprinkled likewise the Tabernacle with
blood also, and all the ministring vessels.
22 And almost all things are by the Law
purged with blood, and without sheading

then necessary, that the similitudes of
heauenly things should be purified with
such things: but the heauenly things them
selues are purified with better sacrifices
24 For Christ is not
then are these.
entred into ye holy places that are made
Hebrews 10:11
with hands, which are similitudes of ye
true Sanctuarie: but is entred into very
heauen, to appeare now in ye sight of
God for vs, 25 Not that he should offer
himselfe often, as the hie Priest entred
into the Holy place euery yeere with other
blood, 26 (For then must he haue often
suffred since the foundation of the world)
but now in the end of the world hath he
bene made manifest, once to put away
sinne by the sacrifice of him selfe. 27 And
as it is appointed vnto men that they
shall once die, and after that commeth the
iudgement: 28 So Christ was once offered
to take away the sinnes of many, and
vnto them that looke for him, shall he
appeare the second time without sinne
vnto saluation.
10
1 For the Law hauing the shadowe of
good things to come, and not the very
image of the things, can neuer with
those sacrifices, which they offer yeere
by yeere continually, sanctifie the com-
mers thereunto. 2 For would they not
then haue ceased to haue bene offered,
because that the offerers once purged,
should haue had no more conscience of
sinnes? 3 But in those sacrifices there is
a remembrance againe of sinnes euery
yeere. 4 For it is vnpossible that the
blood of bulles and goates should take
away sinnes. 5 Wherefore when he com-
meth into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
and offring thou wouldest not: but a
body hast thou ordeined me. 6 In burnt
offerings, and sinne offrings thou hast
had no pleasure. 7 Then I sayd, Lo, I
come (In the beginning of the booke it is
written of me) that I should doe thy will,
O God. 8 Aboue, when he sayd, Sacrifice
and offring, and burnt offrings, and sinne
offrings thou wouldest not haue, neither
hadst pleasure therein (which are offered
by the Lawe) 9 Then sayd he, Lo, I come
to doe thy wil, O God, he taketh away
the first, that he may stablish the second.
10 By the which wil we are sanctified, euen
by the offring of the body of Iesus Christ
once made. 11 And euery Priest standethHebrews 10:12
1056
dayly ministring, and oft times offreth
one maner of offring, which can neuer
take away sinnes: 12 But this man after
he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes,
sitteth for euer at the right hand of God,
13 And from hencefoorth tarieth, till his
enemies be made his footestoole. 14 For
with one offering hath he consecrated for
euer them that are sanctified. 15 For the
holy Ghost also beareth vs record: for
after that he had sayd before, 16 This is
the Testament that I will make vnto them
after those dayes, sayth the Lord, I wil
put my Lawes in their heart, and in their
mindes I will write them. 17 And their
sinnes and iniquities will I remember no
more. 18 Nowe where remission of these
things is, there is no more offering for
sinne. 19 Seeing therefore, brethren, that
by the blood of Iesus we may be bolde
to enter into the Holy place, 20 By the
newe and liuing way, which hee hath
prepared for vs, through the vaile, that is,
his flesh: 21 And seeing we haue an hie
Priest, which is ouer the house of God,
22 Let vs drawe neere with a true heart
in assurance of faith, our hearts being
pure from an euill conscience, 23 And
washed in our bodies with pure water,
let vs keepe the profession of our hope,
without wauering, (for he is faithfull that
promised) 24 And let vs consider one an-
other, to prouoke vnto loue, and to good
workes, 25 Not forsaking the fellowship
that we haue among our selues, as the
maner of some is: but let vs exhort one
another, and that so much the more, be-
cause ye see that the day draweth neere.
26 For if we sinne willingly after that
we haue receiued and acknowledged that
trueth, there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sinnes, 27 But a fearefull looking for of
iudgement, and violent fire, which shall
deuoure the aduersaries. 28 He that de-
spiseth Moses Law, dieth without mercy
vnder two, or three witnesses: 29 Of howe
much sorer punishment suppose ye shall
hee be worthy, which treadeth vnder
foote the Sonne of God, and counteth
the blood of the Testament as an vnholy
thing, wherewith he was sanctified, and
doeth despite the Spirit of grace? 30 For
Hebrews 11:6
we know him that hath sayd, Vengeance
belongeth vnto mee: I will recompense,
saith the Lord. And againe, The Lord shall
iudge his people. 31 It is a fearefull thing
to fall into the hands of the liuing God.
32 Nowe call to remembrance the dayes
that are passed, in the which, after ye had
receiued light, ye endured a great fight
in afflictions, 33 Partly while yee were
made a gazing stocke both by reproches
and afflictions, and partly while ye be-
came companions of them which were
so tossed to and from. 34 For both ye
sorowed with mee for my bonds, and
suffered with ioy the spoyling of your
goods, knowing in your selues howe that
ye haue in heauen a better, and an
enduring substance. 35 Cast not away
therefore your confidence which hath
great recompense of reward. 36 For ye
haue neede of patience, that after ye haue
done the will of God, ye might receiue
the promise. 37 For yet a very litle while,
and hee that shall come, will come, and
will not tary. 38 Nowe the iust shall liue
by faith: but if any withdrawe himselfe,
my soule shall haue no pleasure in him.
39 But we are not they which withdrawe
our selues vnto perdition, but follow faith
vnto the conseruation of the soule.
1 Now
11
faith is the grounds of things,
which are hoped for, and the euidence of
things which are not seene. 2 For by it our
elders were well reported of. 3 Through
faith we vnderstand that the world was
ordeined by the worde of God, so that
the things which we see, are not made of
things which did appeare. 4 By faith Abel
offered vnto God a greater sacrifice then
Cain, by the which he obtained witnes
that he was righteous, God testifying of
his gifts: by the which faith also he
being dead, yet speaketh. 5 By faith was
Enoch translated, that he should not see
death: neither was he found: for God
had translated him: for before he was
translated, he was reported of, that he
had pleased God. 6 But without faith it
is vnpossible to please him: for he thatHebrews 11:7
1057
commeth to God, must beleeue that God
is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
seeke him. 7 By faith Noe being warned of
God of the things which were as yet not
seene, mooued with reuerence, prepared
the Arke to the sauing of his housholde,
through the which Arke hee condemned
the world, and was made heire of the
righteousnes, which is by faith. 8 By faith
Abraham, when he was called, obeyed
God, to goe out into a place, which hee
should afterward receiue for inheritance,
and he went out, not knowing whither he
went. 9 By faith he abode in the land of
promise, as in a strange countrey, as one
that dwelt in tents with Isaac and Iacob
heires with him of the same promise.
10 For he looked for a citie hauing a
foundation, whose builder and maker is
God. 11 Through faith Sara also receiued
strength to conceiue seede, and was deli-
uered of a childe when she was past age,
because she iudged him faithfull which
had promised. 12 And therefore sprang
there of one, euen of one which was dead,
so many as the starres of the skie in
multitude, and as the land of the sea shore
which is innumerable. 13 All these died
in faith, and receiued not the promises,
but sawe them a farre off, and beleeued
them, and receiued them thankefully, and
confessed that they were strangers and
pilgrims on the earth. 14 For they that
say such things, declare plainely, that
they seeke a countrey. 15 And if they
had bene mindfull of that countrey, from
whence they came out, they had leasure
to haue returned. 16 But nowe they desire
a better, that is an heauenly: wherefore
God is not ashamed of them to be called
their God: for he hath prepared for them
a citie. 17 By faith Abraham offered vp
Isaac, when he was tryed, and he that
had receiued the promises, offered his
onely begotten sonne. 18 (To whom it was
said, In Isaac shall thy seede be called.)
19 For he considered that God was able to
raise him vp euen from the dead: from
whence he receiued him also after a sort.
20 By faith Isaac blessed Iacob and Esau,
concerning things to come. 21 By faith
Hebrews 11:36
Iacob when he was a dying, blessed both
the sonnes of Ioseph, and leaning on the
ende of his staffe, worshipped God. 22 By
faith Ioseph when he died, made mention
of the departing of the children of Israel,
and gaue commandement of his bones.
23 By faith Moses when he was borne, was
hid three moneths of his parents, because
they sawe he was a proper childe, neither
feared they the kings commandement.
24 By faith Moses when he was come to
age, refused to be called the sonne of
Pharaohs daughter, 25 And chose rather to
suffer aduersitie with the people of God,
then to enioy the pleasures of sinnes for a
season, 26 Esteeming the rebuke of Christ
greater riches then the treasures of Egypt:
for he had respect vnto the recompence
of the reward. 27 By faith he forsooke
Egypt, and feared not the fiercenes of
the king: for he endured, as he that
sawe him which is inuisible. 28 Through
faith he ordeined the Passeouer and the
effusion of blood, least he that destroyed
the first borne, should touche them. 29 By
faith they passed through the red sea as
by drie land, which when the Egyptians
had assayed to doe, they were swallowed
vp. 30 By faith the walles of Iericho fell
downe after they were copassed about
seue dayes. 31 By faith the harlot Rahab
perished not with them which obeyed not,
when she had receiued the spies peace-
ably. 32 And what shall I more say? for
the time would be too short for me to tell
of Gedeon, of Barac, and of Sampson, and
of Iephte, also of Dauid, and Samuel, and
of the Prophets: 33 Which through faith
subdued kingdomes, wrought righteous-
nesse, obteined the promises, stopped
the mouthes of lions, 34 Quenched the
violence of fire, escaped the edge of the
sworde, of weake were made strong,
waxed valiant in battell, turned to flight
the armies of the aliants. 35 The women
receiued their dead raised to life: other
also were racked, and woulde not be
deliuered, that they might receiue a better
resurrection. 36 And others haue bene
tryed by mockings and scourgings, yea,
moreouer by bondes and prisonment.Hebrews 11:37
1058
37 They
were stoned, they were hewen
asunder, they were tempted, they were
slaine with the sworde, they wandred vp
and downe in sheepes skinnes, and in
goates skinnes, being destitute, afflicted,
and tormented: 38 Whom the world was
not worthie of: they wandered in wilder-
nesses and mountaines, and dennes, and
39 And these all
caues of the earth.
through faith obteined good report, and
receiued not the promise, 40 God prouid-
ing a better thing for vs, that they without
vs should not be made perfite.
12
1 Wherefore, let vs also, seeing that we
are compassed with so great a cloude
of witnesses, cast away euery thing
that presseth downe, and the sinne that
hangeth so fast on: let vs runne with
patience the race that is set before vs,
2 Looking vnto Iesus the authour and
finisher of our faith, who for the ioy
that was set before him, endured the
crosse, and despised the shame, and is set
at the right hand of the throne of God.
3 Consider therefore him that endured
such speaking against of sinners, lest
ye should be wearied and faint in your
mindes. 4 Ye haue not yet resisted vnto
blood, striuing against sinne. 5 And ye
haue forgotten the consolation, which
speaketh vnto you as vnto children, My
sonne, despise not the chastening of the
Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked
of him. 6 For whom the Lord loueth,
he chasteneth: and he scourgeth euery
sonne that he receiueth: 7 If ye endure
chastening, God offereth him selfe vnto
you as vnto sonnes: for what sonne
is it whom the father chasteneth not?
8 If therefore ye be without correction,
whereof al are partakers, then are ye
bastards, and not sonnes. 9 Moreouer
we haue had the fathers of our bodies
which corrected vs, and we gaue them
reuerence: should we not much rather be
in subiection vnto the father of spirites,
that we might liue? 10 For they verely
for a few dayes chastened vs after their
owne pleasure: but he chasteneth vs for
our profite, that we might be partakers
Hebrews 12:25
of his holinesse. 11 Now no chastising
for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but,
grieuous: but afterwarde, it bringeth the
quiet fruite of righteousnesse, vnto them
which are thereby exercised. 12 Wherfore
lift vp your hands which hang downe, and
your weake knees, 13 And make straight
steppes vnto your feete, lest that which is
halting, be turned out of the way, but let
it rather be healed. 14 Followe peace with
all men, and holinesse, without the which
no man shall see ye Lord. 15 Take heede,
that no man fall away from the grace
of God: let no roote of bitternes spring
vp and trouble you, lest thereby many
be defiled. 16 Let there be no fornicator,
or prophane person as Esau, which for
one portion of meate solde his birthright.
17 For ye knowe howe that afterwarde
also when he woulde haue inherited the
blessing, he was reiected: for he founde
no place to repentance, though he sought
that blessing with teares. 18 For ye are
not come vnto the mount that might
be touched, nor vnto burning fire, nor
to blacknes and darkenes, and tempest,
19 Neither vnto the sounde of a trumpet,
and the voyce of wordes, which they
that heard it, excused themselues, that
the word should not be spoken to them
any more, 20 (For they were not able to
abide that which was commanded, yea,
though a beast touche the mountaine, it
shalbe stoned, or thrust through with a
dart: 21 And so terrible was the sight
which appeared, that Moses said, I feare
and quake.) 22 But ye are come vnto
the mount Sion, and to the citie of the
liuing God, the celestiall Hierusalem, and
to ye company of innumerable Angels,
23 And to the assemblie and congregation
of the first borne, which are written in
heauen, and to God the iudge of all, and
to the spirits of iust and perfite men,
24 And to Iesus the Mediatour of the new
Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling
that speaketh better things then that of
Abel. 25 See that ye despise not him
that speaketh: for if they escaped not
which refused him, that spake on earth:
much more shall we not escape, if weHebrews 12:26
1059
turne away from him, that speaketh from
heauen. 26 Whose voyce then shooke the
earth and nowe hath declared, saying,
Yet once more will I shake, not the earth
onely, but also heauen. 27 And this worde,
Yet once more, signifieth the remouing
of those things which are shaken, as of
things which are made with hands, that
the things which are not shaken, may
remaine. 28 Wherefore seeing we receiue
a kingdome, which cannot be shaken,
let vs haue grace whereby we may so
serue God, that we may please him with
reuerence and feare. 29 For euen our God
is a consuming fire.

brotherly loue continue. 2 Be
not forgetfull to intertaine strangers: for
thereby some haue receiued Angels into
their houses vnwares. 3 Remember them

among all, and the bed vndefiled: but
whoremongers and adulterers God will
iudge. 5 Let your conuersation be without
couetousnesse, and be content with those
things that ye haue, for he hath said, 6 I
will not faile thee, neither forsake thee:
7 So that we may boldly say, The Lord
is mine helper, neither will I feare what
man can doe vnto me. 8 Remember them
which haue the ouersight of you, which
haue declared vnto you the word of God:
whose faith follow, considering what hath
bene the ende of their conuersation. Iesus
Christ yesterday, and to day, the same
also is for euer. 9 Be not caried about
with diuers and strange doctrines: for it is
a good thing that the heart be stablished
with grace, and not with meates, which
haue not profited them that haue bene
occupied therein. 10 We haue an altar,
whereof they haue no authoritie to eate,
which serue in the tabernacle. 11 For the
bodies of those beastes whose blood is
brought into the Holy place by the high
Priest for sinne, are burnt without the
campe. 12 Therefore euen Iesus, that he
might sanctifie the people with his owne
Hebrews 13:25
blood, suffered without the gate. 13 Let
vs goe foorth to him therefore out of
the campe, bearing his reproch. 14 For
here haue we no continuing citie: but we
seeke one to come. 15 Let vs therefore by
him offer the sacrifice of prayse alwaies
to God, that is, the fruite of the lippes,
which confesse his Name. 16 To doe good,
and to distribute forget not: for with
such sacrifices God is pleased. 17 Obey
them that haue the ouersight of you, and
submit your selues: for they watche for
your soules, as they that must giue ac-
countes, that they may doe it with ioy, and
not with griefe: for that is vnprofitable
for you. 18 Pray for vs: for we are
assured that we haue a good conscience
in all things, desiring to liue honestly.
19 And I desire you somewhat the more
earnestly, that yee so doe, that I may be
restored to you more quickly. 20 The God
of peace that brought againe from the
dead our Lord Iesus, the great shepheard
of the sheepe, through the blood of the
euerlasting Couenant, 21 Make you per-
fect in all good workes, to doe his will,
working in you that which is pleasant in
his sight through Iesus Christ, to whom
be praise for euer and euer, Amen. 22 I
beseeche you also, brethren, suffer the
wordes of exhortation: for I haue written
vnto you in fewe wordes. 23 Knowe that
our brother Timotheus is deliuered, with
whome (if hee come shortly) I will see
you. 24 Salute all them that haue the
ouersight of you, and all the Saintes. They
of Italie salute you. 25 Grace be with you
all, Amen. ‘Written to the Hebrewes from
Italie, and sent by Timotheus.’James 1:1

THE GENERAL EPISTLE
OF JAMES
Iames a seruant of God, and of
the Lord Iesus Christ, to the twelue
Tribes, which are scattered abroade, salu-
tation. 2 My brethren, count it exceeding
ioy, when ye fall into diuers tentations,
3 Knowing that ye trying of your faith
bringeth forth patience, 4 And let patience
haue her perfect worke, that ye may be
perfect and entier, lacking nothing. 5 If
any of you lacke wisedome, let him aske
of God, which giueth to all men liberally,
and reprocheth no man, and it shalbe
giuen him. 6 But let him aske in faith,
and wauer not: for hee that wauereth,
is like a waue of the sea, tost of the
winde, and caried away. 7 Neither let
that man thinke that hee shall receiue any
thing of the Lord. 8 A double minded
man is vnstable in all his waies. 9 Let
the brother of lowe degree reioyce in
that he is exalted: 10 Againe hee that is
rich, in that hee is made lowe: for as
the flower of the grasse, shall he vanish
away. 11 For as when the sunne riseth
with heate, then the grasse withereth,
and his flower falleth away, and the
goodly shape of it perisheth: euen so
shall the rich man wither away in all his
waies. 12 Blessed is ye man, that endureth
tentation: for when he is tried, hee shall
receiue the crowne of life, which the Lord
hath promised to them that loue him.
13 Let no man say when hee is tempted,
I am tempted of God: for God can not bee
tempted with euill, neither tempteth he
any man. 14 But euery man is tempted,
when hee is drawen away by his owne
concupiscence, and is entised. 15 Then
when lust hath conceiued, it bringeth
foorth sinne, and sinne when it is fin-
ished, bringeth foorth death. 16 Erre not,
my deare brethren. 17 Euery good giuing,
and euery perfect gift is from aboue,
and commeth downe from the Father
of lights, with whome is no variablenes,
neither shadow of turning. 18 Of his owne
1
James 2:6
will begate hee vs with the woorde of
trueth, that we shoulde be as the first
fruites of his creatures. 19 Wherefore my
deare brethren, let euery man be swift
to heare, slowe to speake, and slowe to
wrath. 20 For the wrath of man doeth
not accomplish the righteousnesse of God.
21 Wherefore lay apart all filthinesse,
and superfluitie of maliciousnesse, and
receiue with meekenes the word that is
graffed in you, which is able to saue
your soules. 22 And be ye doers of the
word, and not hearers onely, deceiuing
your owne selues. 23 For if any heare
the woorde, and doe it not, he is like
vnto a man, that beholdeth his naturall
face in a glasse. 24 For when he hath
considered himselfe, hee goeth his way,
and forgetteth immediately what maner
of one he was. 25 But who so looketh in the
perfect Lawe of libertie, and continueth
therein, hee not being a forgetful hearer,
but a doer of the woorke, shalbe blessed
in his deede. 26 If any man amog you
seeme religious, and refraineth not his
tongue, but deceiueth his owne heart,
27 Pure
this mans religion is vaine.
religion and vndefiled before God, euen
the Father, is this, to visite the fatherlesse,
and widdowes in their aduersitie, and to
keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world.

1 My brethren, haue not the faith of our
glorious Lord Iesus Christ in respect of
persons. 2 For if there come into your
company a man with a golde ring, and in
goodly apparell, and there come in also
a poore man in vile raiment, 3 And ye
haue a respect to him that weareth the
gaie clothing; and say vnto him, Sit thou
here in a goodly place, and say vnto the
poore, Stand thou there, or sit here vnder
my footestoole, 4 Are yee not partiall in
your selues, and are become iudges of
euill thoughts? 5 Hearken my beloued
brethren, hath not God chosen the poore
of this worlde, that they should be rich in
faith, and heires of the kingdome which
he promised to them that loue him? 6 But
ye haue despised the poore. Doe not theJames 2:7
1061
riche oppresse you by tyrannie, and doe
not they drawe you before the iudgement
seates? 7 Doe nor they blaspheme the
worthie Name after which yee be named?
8 But if yee fulfill the royall Lawe accord-
ing to the Scripture, which saith, Thou
shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, yee
doe well. 9 But if yee regarde the per-
sons, yee commit sinne, and are rebuked
of the Lawe, as transgressours. 10 For
whosoeuer shall keepe the whole Lawe,
and yet faileth in one poynt, hee is guiltie
of all. 11 For he that saide, Thou shalt not
commit adulterie, saide also, Thou shalt
not kill. Nowe though thou doest none
adulterie, yet if thou killest, thou art a
transgressour of the Lawe. 12 So speake
ye, and so doe, as they that shall be iudged
by the Lawe of libertie. 13 For there
shalbe condemnation merciles to him that
sheweth not mercie, and mercie reioyceth
against condemnation. 14 What auaileth
it, my brethren, though a man saith he
hath faith, when he hath no workes? can
that faith saue him? 15 For if a brother or
a sister bee naked and destitute of daily
foode, 16 And one of you say vnto them,
Depart in peace: warme your selues, and
fil your bellies, notwithstading ye giue
them not those things which are needefull
to the body, what helpeth it? 17 Euen so
the faith, if it haue no woorkes, is dead
in it selfe. 18 But some man might say,
Thou hast the faith, and I haue woorkes:
shewe me thy faith out of thy woorkes,
and I will shewe thee my faith by my
woorkes. 19 Thou beleeuest that there is
one God: thou doest well: the deuils also
beleeue it, and tremble. 20 But wilt thou
vnderstand, O thou vaine man, that the
faith which is without workes, is dead?
21 Was not Abraham our father iustified
through workes, when he offred Isaac his
sonne vpon the altar? 22 Seest thou not
that the faith wrought with his workes?
and through the workes was the faith
made perfect. 23 And the Scripture was
fulfilled which sayeth, Abraham beleeued
God, and it was imputed vnto him for
righteousnesse: and hee was called the
friende of God. 24 Ye see then howe that of
James 3:15
workes a man is iustified, and not of faith
onely. 25 Likewise also was not Rahab
the harlot iustified through workes, when
she had receiued ye messengers, and sent
them out another way? 26 For as the body
without ye spirit is dead, euen so the faith
without workes is dead.
1 My brethren,
3
be not many masters,
knowing that we shall receiue the greater
condemnation. 2 For in many things we
sinne all. If any man sinne not in word,
he is a perfect man, and able to bridle all
the body. 3 Beholde, we put bittes into
the horses mouthes, that they should obey
vs, and we turne about all their bodie.
4 Behold also the shippes, which though
they be so great, and are driuen of fierce
windes, yet are they turned about with
a very small rudder, whither soeuer the
gouernour listeth. 5 Euen so the tongue
is a litle member, and boasteth of great
things: beholde, howe great a thing a litle
fire kindleth. 6 And the tongue is fire, yea,
a worlde of wickednesse: so is the tongue
set among our members, that it defileth
the whole body, and setteth on fire the
course of nature, and it is set on fire of
hell. 7 For the whole nature of beasts,
and of birds, and of creeping things, and
things of the sea is tamed, and hath bene
tamed of the nature of man. 8 But the
tongue can no man tame. It is an vnruly
euill, full of deadly poyson. 9 Therewith
blesse we God euen the Father, and
therewith curse we men, which are made
after the similitude of God. 10 Out of one
mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing:
my brethren, these things ought not so
to be. 11 Doeth a fountaine send forth
at one place sweete water and bitter?
12 Can ye figge tree, my brethren, bring
forth oliues, either a vine figges? so can
no fountaine make both salt water and
sweete. 13 Who is a wise man and endued
with knowledge among you? let him
shew by good conuersation his workes in
meekenesse of wisdome. 14 But if ye haue
bitter enuying and strife in your hearts,
reioyce not, neither be liars against the
trueth. 15 This wisedome descendeth notJames 3:16
1062
from aboue, but is earthly, sensuall, and
deuilish. 16 For where enuying and strife
is, there is sedition, and all maner of
euill workes. 17 But the wisedome that is
from aboue, is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercie
and good fruites, without iudging, and
without hipocrisie. 18 And the fruite of
righteousnesse is sowen in peace, of them
that make peace.
1 From
4
whence are warres and con-
tentions among you? are they not hence,
euen of your pleasures, that fight in
2 Ye lust, and haue
your members?
not: ye enuie, and desire immoderately,
and cannot obtaine: ye fight and warre,
and get nothing, because ye aske not.
3 Ye aske, and receiue not, because ye
aske amisse, that ye might lay the same
out on your pleasures. 4 Ye adulterers
and adulteresses, knowe ye not that the
amitie of the world is the enimitie of
God? Whosoeuer therefore will be a
friend of the world, maketh himselfe the
enemie of God. 5 Doe ye thinke that
the Scripture sayeth in vaine, The spirit
that dwelleth in vs, lusteth after enuie?
6 But the Scripture offereth more grace,
and therefore sayth, God resisteth the
proude, and giueth grace to the humble.
7 Submit your selues to God: resist the
deuill, and he will flee from you. 8 Drawe
neere to God, and he will drawe neere
to you. Clense your handes, ye sinners,
and purge your hearts, ye double minded.
9 Suffer afflictions, and sorrowe ye, and
weepe: let your laughter be turned into
mourning, and your ioy into heauinesse.
10 Cast downe your selues before the Lord,
and he will lift you vp. 11 Speake not
euill one of another, brethren. He that
speaketh euill of his brother, or he that
condemneth his brother, speaketh euill of
ye Law, and condemneth the Lawe: and
if thou condemnest the Lawe, thou art
not an obseruer of the Lawe, but a iudge.
12 There is one Lawgiuer, which is able to
saue, and to destroy. Who art thou that
iudgest another man? 13 Goe to now ye
James 5:11
that say, To day or to morowe we will
goe into such a citie, and continue there
a yeere, and bye and sell, and get gaine,
14 (And yet ye cannot tell what shalbe to
morowe. For what is your life? It is euen
a vapour that appeareth for a litle time,
and afterward vanisheth away) 15 For that
ye ought to say, If the Lord will, and, if
we liue, we will doe this or that. 16 But
now ye reioyce in your boastings: all such
reioycing is euill. 17 Therefore, to him that
knoweth how to doe well, and doeth it
not, to him it is sinne.
5
1 Goe to nowe, ye rich men: weepe, and
howle for your miseries that shall come
vpon you. 2 Your riches are corrupt, and
your garments are moth eaten. 3 Your
gold and siluer is cankred, and the rust
of them shalbe a witnesse against you,
and shall eate your flesh, as it were fire.
Ye haue heaped vp treasure for the last
dayes. 4 Behold, the hire of ye labourers,
which haue reaped your fieldes (which
is of you kept backe by fraude) cryeth,
and the cryes of them which haue reaped,
are entred into the eares of the Lord of
hostes. 5 Ye haue liued in pleasure on
the earth, and in wantonnes. Ye haue
nourished your heartes, as in a day of
slaughter. 6 Ye haue condemned and haue
killed the iust, and he hath not resisted
you. 7 Be patient therefore, brethren,
vnto the comming of the Lord. Behold,
the husbandman wayteth for the precious
fruite of the earth, and hath long patience
for it, vntill he receiue the former, and the
latter rayne. 8 Be ye also patient therefore
and settle your hearts: for ye comming
of the Lord draweth neere. 9 Grudge
not one against another, brethren, least
ye be condemned: behold, the iudge
standeth before the doore. 10 Take, my
brethren, the Prophets for an ensample of
suffering aduersitie, and of long patience,
which haue spoken in the Name of the
Lord. 11 Beholde, we count them blessed
which endure. Ye haue heard of the
patience of Iob, and haue knowen what
ende the Lord made. For the Lord isJames 5:12
1063
very pitifull and mercifull. 12 But before
all thinges, my brethren, sweare not,
neither by heauen, nor by earth, nor
by any other othe: but let your yea,
be yea, and your nay, nay, lest ye fall
into condemnation. 13 Is any among you
afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merie?
Let him sing. 14 Is any sicke among
you? Let him call for the Elders of the
Church, and let them pray for him, and
anoynt him with oyle in the Name of the
Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith shall
saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise
him vp: and if he haue committed sinnes,
they shalbe forgiuen him. 16 Acknowledge
your faultes one to another, and pray one
for another, that ye may be healed: for
the prayer of a righteous man auaileth
much, if it be feruent. 17 Helias was a
man subiect to like passions as we are,
and he prayed earnestly that it might not
rayne, and it rayned not on the earth for
three yeeres and sixe moneths. 18 And
he prayed againe, and the heauen gaue
rayne, and the earth brought forth her
fruite. 19 Brethren, if any of you hath
erred from the trueth, and some man
hath conuerted him, 20 Let him know
that he which hath conuerted the sinner
from going astray out of his way, shall
saue a soule from death, and shall hide
a multitude of sinnes.

THE FIRST EPISTLE
GENERAL OF PETER
1 PETER an Apostle of IESVS CHRIST, to
the strangers that dwell here and there
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia and Bithynia, 2 Elect according to
the foreknowledge of God ye Father vnto
sanctification of ye Spirit, through obedi-
ence and sprinkeling of the blood of Iesus
Christ: Grace and peace bee multiplied
vnto you. 3 Blessed bee God, euen the
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which
according to his aboundant mercie hath
begotten vs againe vnto a liuely hope
by the resurrection of Iesus Christ from
the dead, 4 To an inheritance immortall
and vndefiled, and that withereth not,
reserued in heauen for vs, 5 Which are
kept by the power of God through faith
vnto saluation, which is prepared to be
shewed in the last time. 6 Wherein yee
reioyce, though nowe for a season (if
neede require) yee are in heauinesse,
through manifolde tentations, 7 That the
triall of your faith, being much more pre-
cious then golde that perisheth (though
it be tried with fire) might bee founde
vnto your praise, and honour and glorie
at the appearing of Iesus Christ: 8 Whome
yee haue not seene, and yet loue him, in
whome nowe, though yee see him not,
yet doe you beleeue, and reioyce with ioy
vnspeakeable and glorious, 9 Receiuing
the ende of your faith, euen the salu-
ation of your soules. 10 Of the which
saluation ye Prophets haue inquired and
searched, which prophecied of the grace
that should come vnto you, 11 Searching
when or what time the Spirite which
testified before of Christ which was in
them, shoulde declare the sufferings that
should come vnto Christ, and the glorie
that shoulde follow. 12 Vnto whome it
was reueiled, that not vnto themselues,
but vnto vs they shoulde minister the
things, which are nowe shewed vnto you
by them which haue preached vnto you
the Gospell by the holy Ghost sent downe
1 Peter 2:4
from heauen, the which things the Angels
desire to beholde. 13 Wherefore, girde
vp the Ioynes of your minde: bee sober,
and trust perfectly on that grace that is
brought vnto you, in the reuelation of
Iesus Christ, 14 As obedient children, not
fashioning your selues vnto the former
lustes of your ignorance: 15 But as hee
which hath called you, is holie, so be
yee holie in all maner of conuersation;
16 Because it is written, Be yee holie,
for I am holie. 17 And if ye call him
Father, which without respect of person
iudgeth according to euery mans woorke,
passe the time of your dwelling here in
feare, 18 Knowing that yee were not re-
deemed with corruptible things, as siluer
and golde, from your vaine conuersation,
receiued by the traditions of the fathers,
19 But with the precious blood of Christ,
as of a Lambe vndefiled, and without
spot. 20 Which was ordeined before the
foundation of the world, but was declared
in the last times for your sakes, 21 Which
by his meanes doe beleeue in God that
raised him from the dead, and gaue him
glorie, that your faith and hope might bee
in God, 22 Hauing purified your soules
in obeying the trueth through the spirite,
to loue brotherly without faining, loue
one another with a pure heart feruently,
23 Being borne anewe, not of mortall
seede, but of immortall, by the woorde
of God, who liueth and endureth for
euer. 24 For all flesh is as grasse, and
all the glorie of man is as the flower of
grasse. The grasse withereth, and the
flower falleth away. 25 But the worde of
the Lord endureth for euer: and this is the
woorde which is preached among you.
2
Wherefore, laying aside all mali-
ciousnes, and all guile, and dissimulation,
and enuie, and all euill speaking, 2 As
newe borne babes desire that sincere
milke of the woorde, that yee may growe
thereby, 3 Because yee haue tasted that
the Lord is bountifull. 4 To whome com-
ming as vnto a liuing stone disallowed
of men, but chosen of God and precious,
11 Peter 2:5
5 Yee also as liuely stones,
1065
bee made a
spirituall house, an holy Priesthoode to
offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to
God by Iesus Christ. 6 Wherefore also it
is conteyned in the Scripture, Beholde, I
put in Sion a chiefe corner stone, elect
and precious: and hee that beleeueth
therein, shall not be ashamed. 7 Vnto you
therefore which beleeue, it is precious:
but vnto them which be disobedient, the
stone which the builders disallowed, the
same is made the head of the corner,
8 And a stone to stumble at, and a rocke
of offence, euen to them which stumble
at the woorde, being disobedient, vnto
the which thing they were euen ordeined.
9 But yee are a chosen generation, a royall
Priesthoode, an holy nation, a people set
at libertie, that yee shoulde shewe foorth
the vertues of him that hath called you
out of darkenesse into his marueilous
light, 10 Which in time past were not
a people, yet are nowe the people of
God: which in time past were not vnder
mercie, but nowe haue obteined mercie.
11 Dearely beloued, I beseeche you, as
strangers and pilgrims, abstaine from
fleshly lusts, which fight against the soule,
12 And haue your conuersation honest
among the Gentiles, that they which
speake euill of you as of euill doers, may
by your good woorkes which they shall
see, glorifie God in the day of visitation.
13 Therefore submit your selues vnto all
maner ordinance of man for the Lordes
sake, whether it be vnto the King, as vnto
the superiour, 14 Or vnto gouernours, as
vnto them that are sent of him, for the
punishment of euill doers, and for the
praise of them that doe well. 15 For so
is the will of God, that by well doing ye
may put to silence the ignorance of the
foolish men, 16 As free, and not as hauing
the libertie for a cloke of maliciousnesse,
but as the seruauntes of God. 17 Honour
all men: loue brotherly fellowship: feare
God: honour the King. 18 Seruaunts, be
subiect to your masters with all feare,
not onely to the good and courteous, but
also to the froward. 19 For this is thanke
worthie, if a man for conscience toward
1 Peter 3:9
God endure griefe, suffering wrongfully.
20 For what praise is it, if when ye be
buffeted for your faultes, yee take it
paciently? but and if when ye doe well,
ye suffer wrong and take it paciently, this
is acceptable to God. 21 For hereunto
ye are called: for Christ also suffred for
you, leauing you an ensample that ye
should follow his steppes. 22 Who did no
sinne, neither was there guile found in
his mouth. 23 Who when hee was reuiled,
reuiled not againe: when hee suffered,
hee threatned not, but comitted it to him
that iudgeth righteously. 24 Who his owne
selfe bare our sinnes in his body on the
tree, that we being dead to sinne, should
liue in righteousnesse: by whose stripes
ye were healed. 25 For ye were as sheepe
going astray: but are nowe returned vnto
the shepheard and Bishop of your soules.
1 Likewise
3
let the wiues bee subiect
to their husbands, that euen they which
obey not the worde, may without the
worde be wonne by the conuersation of
the wiues, 2 While they beholde your
pure conuersation, which is with feare.
3 Whose apparelling, let it not be that
outwarde, with broyded heare, and golde
put about, or in putting on of apparell:
4 But let it bee the hidde man of the heart,
which consisteth in the incorruption of a
meeke and quiet spirite, which is before
God a thing much set by. 5 For euen
after this maner in time past did the
holy women, which trusted in God, tire
them selues, and were subiect to their
husbands. 6 As Sara obeyed Abraham,
and called him Sir: whose daughters ye
are, whiles yee doe well, not being afraide
of any terrour. 7 Likewise ye husbands,
dwel with them as men of knowledge,
giuing honour vnto the woman, as vnto
the weaker vessell, euen as they which
are heires together of the grace of life,
that your prayers be not interrupted.
8 Finally, be ye all of one minde: one
suffer with another: loue as brethren:
bee pitifull: bee courteous, 9 Not rendring
euil for euill, neither rebuke for rebuke:1 Peter 3:10
1066
but contrarywise blesse, knowing that ye
are thereunto called, that ye should be
heires of blessing. 10 For if any man long
after life, and to see good dayes, let him
refraine his tongue from euill, and his
lippes that they speake no guile. 11 Let
him eschew euil, and do good: let him
seeke peace, and follow after it. 12 For the
eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous,
and his eares are open vnto their prayers:
and the face of the Lord is against them
that do euil. 13 And who is it that will
harme you, if ye follow that which is
good? 14 Notwithstanding blessed are ye,
if ye suffer for righteousnes sake. Yea,
feare not their feare, neither be troubled.
15 But sanctifie the Lord God in your
hearts: and be ready alwayes to giue an
answere to euery man that asketh you a
reason of the hope that is in you, with
meekenesse and reuerence, 16 Hauing a
good coscience, that whe they speake
euill of you as of euill doers, they may
be ashamed, which slander your good
conuersation in Christ. 17 For it is better
(if the will of God be so) that ye suffer
for well doing, then for euil doing. 18 For
Christ also hath once suffered for sinnes,
the iust for the vniust, that he might bring
vs to God, and was put to death concern-
ing the flesh, but was quickened by the
spirit. 19 By the which hee also went,
and preached vnto the spirits that are in
prison. 20 Which were in time passed
disobedient, when once the long suffering
of God abode in the dayes of Noe, while
the Arke was preparing, wherein fewe,
that is, eight soules were saued in the

nowe is, answering that figure, (which
is not a putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but a confident demaunding which
a good conscience maketh to God) saueth
vs also by the resurrection of Iesus Christ,
22 Which is at the right hand of God, gone
into heauen, to whom the Angels, and
Powers, and might are subiect.
1 Peter 4:15
likewise with the same minde, which is,
that he which hath suffered in the flesh,
hath ceased from sinne, 2 That he hence
forward should liue (as much time as
remaineth in the flesh) not after the lusts
of men, but after the will of God. 3 For it
is sufficient for vs that we haue spet the
time past of ye life, after the lust of the
Gentiles, walking in wantonnes, lustes,
drunkennes, in gluttonie, drinkings, and
in abominable idolatries. 4 Wherein it
seemeth to them strange, that yee runne
not with them vnto the same excesse
of riot: therefore speake they euill of
you, 5 Which shall giue accounts to him,
that is readie to iudge quicke and dead.
6 For vnto this purpose was the Gospell
preached also vnto the dead, that they
might bee condemned, according to men
in the flesh, but might liue according to
God in the spirit. 7 Now the ende of all
things is at hand. Be ye therefore sober,
and watching in prayer. 8 But aboue all
thinges haue feruent loue among you:
for loue shall couer the multitude of
sinnes. 9 Be ye harberous one to another,
without grudging. 10 Let euery man as
hee hath receiued the gift, minister the
same one to another, as good disposers
of the manifolde grace of God. 11 If
any man speake, let him speake as the
wordes of God. If any man minister, let
him do it as of the abilitie which God
ministreth, that God in al things may be
glorified through Iesus Christ, to whome
is prayse and dominion for euer, and
euer, Amen. 12 Dearely beloued, thinke
it not strange concerning the firie triall,
which is among you to proue you, as
though some strange thing were come
vnto you: 13 But reioyce, in asmuch as
ye are partakers of Christs suffrings, that
when his glory shall appeare, ye may
be glad and reioyce. 14 If yee be railed
vpon for the Name of Christ, blessed are
ye: for the spirit of glory, and of God
resteth vpon you: which on their part
is euill spoken of: but on your part is
glorified. 15 But let none of you suffer
4
as a murtherer, or as a thiefe, or an euil
1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suf- doer, or as a busibodie in other mens
fered for vs in the flesh, arme your selues1 Peter 4:16
1067
matters. 16 But if any man suffer as a
Christian, let him not bee ashamed: but
let him glorifie God in this behalfe. 17 For
the time is come, that iudgement must
beginne at the house of God. If it first
beginne at vs, what shall the ende be
of them which obey not the Gospel of
God? 18 And if the righteous scarcely bee
saued, where shall the vngodly and the
sinner appeare? 19 Wherefore let them
that suffer according to the will of God,
commit their soules to him in well doing,
as vnto a faithfull Creator.

1 The elders which are among you,
I
beseech which am also an elder, and a
witnesse of the sufferings of Christ, and
also a partaker of the glory that shalbe
reueiled, 2 Feede the flocke of God, which
dependeth vpon you, caring for it not by
constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lu-
cre, but of a ready minde: 3 Not as though
ye were lords ouer Gods heritage, but
that yee may bee ensamples to the flocke.
4 And when that chiefe shepheard shall
appeare, ye shall receiue an incorruptible
crowne of glory. 5 Likewise ye yonger,
submit your selues vnto the elders, and
submit your selues euery man, one to
another: decke your selues inwardly in
lowlinesse of minde: for God resisteth the
proude, and giueth grace to the humble.
6 Humble your selues therefore vnder the
mightie hand of God, that he may exalt
you in due time. 7 Cast all your care
on him: for he careth for you. 8 Be
sober, and watch: for your aduersarie
the deuil as a roaring lyon walketh about,
seeking whom he may deuoure: 9 Whom
resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that
the same afflictions are accomplished in
your brethren which are in the world.
10 And the God of all grace, which hath
called vs vnto his eternall glory by Christ
Iesus, after that ye haue suffered a litle,
make you perfite, confirme, strengthen
and stablish you. 11 To him be glory and
dominion for euer and euer, Amen. 12 By
Syluanus a faithfull brother vnto you, as I
suppose, haue I written briefly, exhorting
1 Peter 5:14
and testifying how that this is the true
grace of God, wherein ye stand. 13 The
Church that is at Babylon elected together
with you, saluteth you, and Marcus my
sonne. 14 Greete yee one another with the
kisse of loue. Peace be with you all which
are in Christ Iesus, Amen.2 Peter 1:1

THE SECOND EPISTLE
GENERAL OF PETER
1 Simon Peter a seruant and an Apos-
tle of Iesus Christ, to you which haue
obteined like precious faith with vs by the
righteousnesse of our God and Sauiour
Iesus Christ: 2 Grace and peace be multi-
plied to you, through the acknowledging
of God, and of Iesus our Lord, 3 According
as his diuine power hath giuen vnto
vs all things that perteine vnto life and
godlinesse, through the acknowledging
of him that hath called vs vnto glory
and vertue. 4 Whereby most great and
precious promises are giuen vnto vs, that
by them ye should be partakers of the
diuine nature, in that ye flee the cor-
ruption, which is in the worlde through
lust. 5 Therefore giue euen all diligence
thereunto: ioyne moreouer vertue with
your faith: and with vertue, knowledge:
6 And with knowledge, temperance: and
with temperance, patience: and with
patience, godlines: 7 And with godlines,
brotherly kindnes: and with brotherly
kindnes, loue. 8 For if these things be
among you, and abound, they will make
you that ye neither shalbe idle, nor vn-
fruitfull in the acknowledging of our Lord
Iesus Christ: 9 For he that hath not these
things, is blinde, and can not see farre off,
and hath forgotten that he was purged
10 Wherefore,
from his olde sinnes.
brethren, giue rather diligence to make
your calling and election sure: for if
ye doe these things, ye shall neuer fall.
11 For by this meanes an entring shalbe
ministred vnto you aboundantly into the
euerlasting kingdome of our Lord and
Sauiour Iesus Christ. 12 Wherefore, I will
not be negligent to put you alwayes in
remembrance of these things, though that
ye haue knowledge, and be stablished in
the present trueth. 13 For I thinke it meete
as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stirre
you vp by putting you in remembrance,
14 Seeing I knowe that the time is at
hand that I must lay downe this my
2 Peter 2:6
tabernacle, euen as our Lord Iesus Christ
hath shewed me. 15 I will endeuour
therefore alwayes, that ye also may be
able to haue remembrance of these things
after my departing. 16 For we followed not
deceiuable fables when we opened vnto
you the power, and comming of our Lord
Iesus Christ, but with our eyes we saw his
maiestie: 17 For he receiued of God the Fa-
ther honour and glory, when there came
such a voyce to him from that excellent
glory, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom
I am well pleased. 18 And this voyce we
heard when it came from heauen, being
with him in the Holy mount. 19 We haue
also a most sure worde of the Prophets, to
the which ye doe well that yee take heede,
as vnto a light that shineth in a darke
place, vntill the day dawne, and the day
starre arise in your hearts. 20 So that yee
first knowe this, that no prophecie of the
Scripture is of any priuate interpretation.
21 For the prophecie came not in olde time
by the will of man: but holy men of God
spake as they were moued by the holy
Ghost.
1 Bvt
2
there were false prophets also
among the people, euen as there shalbe
false teachers among you: which priuily
shall bring in damnable heresies, euen
denying the Lord, that hath bought them,
and bring vpon themselues swift damna-
2 And many shall follow their
tion.
destructions, by whom the way of trueth
shalbe euil spoken of, 3 And through
couetousnes shall they with fained words
make marchandise of you, whose con-
demnation long since resteth not, and
their destruction slumbreth not. 4 For
if God spared not the Angels that had
sinned, but cast them downe into hell,
and deliuered them into chaines of dark-
enes, to be kept vnto damnation: 5 Neither
hath spared the olde worlde, but saued
Noe the eight person a preacher of righ-
teousnesse, and brought in the flood vpon
the world of the vngodly, 6 And turned
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrhe into
ashes, condemned them and ouerthrewe2 Peter 2:7
1069
them, and made them an ensample vnto
them that after should liue vngodly, 7 And
deliuered iust Loth vexed with the vn-
cleanly conuersation of the wicked: 8 (For
he being righteous, and dwelling among
them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his
righteous soule from day to day with their
vnlawfull deedes.) 9 The Lord knoweth
to deliuer the godly out of tentation, and
to reserue the vniust vnto the day of
iudgement vnder punishment. 10 And
chiefly them that walke after the flesh,
in the lust of vncleannesse, and despise
gouernement, which are bolde, and stand
in their owne conceite, and feare not
to speake euill of them that are in dig-

are greater both in power and might,
giue not railing iudgement against them
before the Lord. 12 But these, as naturall
brute beasts, led with sensualitie and
made to be taken, and destroyed, speake
euill of those things which they know
not, and shall perish through their owne
corruption, 13 And shall receiue the wages
of vnrighteousnes, as they which count it
pleasure dayly to liue deliciously. Spottes
they are and blottes, deliting them selues
in their deceiuings, in feasting with you,
14 Hauing eyes full of adulterie, and that
can not cease to sinne, beguiling vnstable
soules: they haue heartes exercised with
couetousnesse, they are the children of
curse: 15 Which forsaking the right way,
haue gone astray, folowing the way of
Balaam, the sonne of Bosor, which loued

he was rebuked for his iniquitie: for
the dumme beast speaking with mans
voyce, forbade the foolishnesse of the
Prophet. 17 These are welles without
water, and cloudes caried about with a
tempest, to whome the blacke darkenes
is reserued for euer. 18 For in speaking
swelling wordes of vanitie, they beguile
with wantonnesse through the lusts of
the flesh them that were cleane escaped
from them which are wrapped in errour,
19 Promising vnto them libertie, and are
themselues the seruants of corruption:
for of whomsoeuer a man is ouercome,
2 Peter 3:10
euen vnto the same is he in bondage.
20 For if they, after they haue escaped
from the filthinesse of the world, through
the acknowledging of the Lord, and of
the Sauiour Iesus Christ, are yet tangled
againe therein, and ouercome, the lat-
ter ende is worse with them then the
beginning. 21 For it had bene better
for them, not to haue acknowledged the
way of righteousnes, then after they haue
acknowledged it, to turne from the holy
commandement giuen vnto them. 22 But
it is come vnto them, according to the
true Prouerbe, The dogge is returned to
his owne vomit: and, The sowe that was
washed, to the wallowing in the myre.
1 This
3
seconde Epistle I nowe write
vnto you, beloued, wherewith I stirre
vp, and warne your pure mindes, 2 To
call to remembrance the wordes, which
were tolde before of the holy Prophetes,
and also the commandement of vs the
Apostles of the Lord and Sauiour. 3 This
first vnderstande, that there shall come in
the last dayes, mockers, which wil walke
after their lustes, 4 And say, Where is the
promise of his comming? for since the fa-
thers died, all things continue alike from
the beginning of the creation. 5 For this
they willingly know not, that the heauens
were of olde, and the earth that was of
the water and by the water, by the word
of God. 6 Wherefore the worlde that then
was, perished, ouerflowed with the water.
7 But the heauens and earth, which are
nowe, are kept by the same word in store,
and reserued vnto fire against the day
of condemnation, and of the destruction
of vngodly men. 8 Dearely beloued, be
not ignorant of this one thing, that one
day is with the Lord, as a thousande
yeeres, and a thousande yeeres as one
day. 9 The Lord of that promise is not
slacke (as some men count slackenesse)
but is pacient toward vs, and would haue
no man to perish, but would all men to
come to repentance. 10 But the day of the
Lord will come as a thiefe in the night,
in the which the heauens shall passe2 Peter 3:11
1070
away with a noyse, and the elements shall
melt with heate, and the earth with the
workes that are therein, shalbe burnt vp.
11 Seeing therefore that all these thinges
must be dissolued, what maner persons
ought ye to be in holy conuersation and
godlinesse, 12 Looking for, and hasting
vnto the comming of that day of God,
by the which the heauens being on fire,
shall be dissolued, and the elements shall
melt with heate? 13 But wee looke for
newe heauens, and a newe earth, ac-
cording to his promise, wherein dwelleth
righteousnesse. 14 Wherefore, beloued,
seeing that yee looke for such thinges,
be diligent that ye may be found of him
in peace, without spot and blamelesse.
15 And suppose that the long suffering of
our Lord is saluation, euen as our beloued
brother Paul according to the wisedome
giuen vnto him wrote to you, 16 As one,
that in all his Epistles speaketh of these
thinges: among the which some thinges
are hard to be vnderstand, which they
that are vnlearned and vnstable, wrest,
as they do also other Scriptures vnto
their owne destruction. 17 Ye therefore
beloued, seeing ye know these thinges
before, beware, lest ye be also plucked
away with the errour of the wicked, and
fall from your owne stedfastnesse. 18 But
grow in grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: to
him be glory both now and for euermore.
Amen.

1071
THE FIRST EPISTLE
GENERAL OF JOHN
1 That which was from the beginning,
which wee haue heard, which wee haue
seene with these our eyes, which wee
haue looked vpon, and these handes of
ours haue handled of that Word of life,
2 (For that life was made manifest, and
wee haue seene it, and beare witnes,
and shewe vnto you that eternall life,
which was with the Father, and was made
manifest vnto vs) 3 That, I say, which wee
haue seene and heard, declare wee vnto
you, that yee may also haue fellowship
with vs, and that our fellowship also may
be with the Father, and with his Sonne
Iesvs Christ. 4 And these thinges write we
vnto you, that that your ioy may be full.
5 This then is the message which wee haue
heard of him, and declare vnto you, that
God is light, and in him is no darkenes.
6 If wee say that wee haue fellowship with
him, and walke in darkenesse, we lie,
and doe not truely: 7 But if we walke in
the light as he is in the light, we haue
fellowship one with another, and the
blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne clenseth vs
from all sinne. 8 If we say that we haue no
sinne, we deceiue our selues, and trueth
is not in vs. 9 If we acknowledge our
sinnes, he is faithfull and iust, to forgiue
vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all
vnrighteousnes. 10 If wee say we haue not
sinned, wee make him a liar, and his word
is not in vs.
2
1 My little children, these things write
I vnto you, that ye sinne not: and if
any man sinne, wee haue an Aduocate
with the Father, Iesus Christ, the Iust.
2 And he is the reconciliation for our
sinnes: and not for ours onely, but also
for the sinnes of the whole world. 3 And
hereby we are sure that we knowe him,
if we keepe his commandements. 4 Hee
that saith, I knowe him, and keepeth not
his commandements, is a liar, and the
trueth is not in him. 5 But hee that
1 John 2:19
keepeth his worde, in him is the loue
of God perfect in deede: hereby wee
knowe that ye are in him. 6 He that saith
he remaineth in him, ought euen so to
walke, as he hath walked. 7 Brethren, I
write no newe commandement vnto you:
but an olde commandement, which ye
haue had from the beginning: this olde
commandement is that worde, which yee
haue heard from the beginning. 8 Againe,
a new comandement I write vnto you,
that which is true in him, and also in
you: for the darkenes is past, and that
true light now shineth. 9 He that saith
that hee is in that light, and hateth his
brother, is in darkenes, vntill this time.
10 Hee that loueth his brother, abideth in
that light, and there is none occasion of
euil in him. 11 But he that hateth his
brother, is in darkenesse, and walketh
in darkenesse, and knoweth not whither
hee goeth, because that darkenesse hath
12 Litle children, I
blinded his eyes.
write vnto you, because your sinnes are
forgiuen you for his Names sake. 13 I
write vnto you, fathers, because yee haue
knowen him that is from the beginning.
I write vnto you, yong men, because ye
haue ouercome that wicked one. I write
vnto you, litle children, because ye haue
knowen ye Father. 14 I haue written vnto
you, fathers, because ye haue knowen
him, that is from the beginning. I haue
written vnto you, yong men, because ye
are strong, and the worde of God abideth
in you, and ye haue ouercome that wicked
one. 15 Loue not this world, neither the
things that are in this world. If any man
loue this world, the loue of the Father
is not in him. 16 For all that is in this
world (as the lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life) is not of
the Father, but is of this world. 17 And
this world passeth away, and the lust
thereof: but he that fulfilleth the will of
God, abideth euer. 18 Litle children, it is
the last time, and as ye haue heard that
Antichrist shall come, euen now are there
many Antichrists: whereby we know that
it is the last time. 19 They went out from
vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had
bene of vs, they should haue continued1 John 2:20
1072
with vs. But this cometh to passe, that
it might appeare, that they are not all
of vs. 20 But ye haue an ointment from
that Holy one, and know all things. 21 I
haue not written vnto you, because ye
knowe not the trueth: but because ye
knowe it, and that no lie is of the trueth.
22 Who is a liar, but he that denyeth
that Iesus is that Christ? the same is
that Antichrist that denyeth the Father
and the Sonne. 23 Whosoeuer denyeth
the Sonne, the same hath not the Father.
24 Let therefore abide in you that same
which ye haue heard from the beginning.
If that which ye haue heard from the
beginning, shall remaine in you, ye also
shall continue in the Sonne, and in the
Father. 25 And this is the promise that
he hath promised vs, euen that eternall
life. 26 These things haue I written vnto
you, concerning them that deceiue you.
27 But that anointing which ye receiued
of him, dwelleth in you: and ye neede not
that any man teach you: but as the same
Anoynting teacheth you of all things, and
it is true, and is not lying, and as it taught
you, ye shall abide in him. 28 And nowe,
litle children, abide in him, that when he
shall appeare, we may be bolde, and not
be ashamed before him at his comming.
29 If ye know that he is righteous, know ye
that he which doeth righteously, is borne
of him.
1 Behold,
3
what loue the Father hath
giuen to vs, that we should be called the
sonnes of God: for this cause this world
knoweth you not, because it knoweth
not him. 2 Dearely beloued, nowe are
we the sonnes of God, but yet it is not
made manifest what we shall be: and
we know that when he shalbe made
manifest, we shalbe like him: for we
shall see him as he is. 3 And euery
man that hath this hope in him, purgeth
himselfe, euen as he is pure. 4 Whosoeuer
committeth sinne, transgresseth also the
Law: for sinne is the transgression of
the Lawe. 5 And ye knowe that hee
was made manifest, that he might take
away our sinnes, and in him is no sinne.
1 John 3:23
Whosoeuer abideth in him, sinneth
not: whosoeuer sinneth, hath not seene
him, neither hath knowen him. 7 Litle
children, let no man deceiue you: he that
doeth righteousnes, is righteous, as hee
is righteous. 8 He that comitteth sinne,
is of the deuil: for the deuill sinneth
from the beginning: for this purpose was
made manifest that Sonne of God, that
he might loose the workes of the deuil.
9 Whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not:
for his seede remaineth in him, neither
can hee sinne, because he is borne of
God. 10 In this are the children of God
knowen, and the children of the deuil:
whosoeuer doeth not righteousnesse, is
not of God, neither he that loueth not
his brother. 11 For this is the message,
that ye heard from the beginning, that
we should loue one another, 12 Not as
Cain which was of that wicked one, and
slewe his brother: and wherefore slewe
he him? because his owne workes were
euill, and his brothers good. 13 Marueile
not, my brethren, though this world hate
you. 14 We know that we are translated
from death vnto life, because we loue the
brethren: he that loueth not his brother,
abideth in death. 15 Whosoeuer hateth his
brother, is a manslayer: and ye know that
no manslayer hath eternall life abiding
in him. 16 Hereby haue we perceiued
loue, that he layde downe his life for vs:
therefore we ought also to lay downe our
liues for the brethren. 17 And whosoeuer
hath this worlds good, and seeth his
brother haue neede, and shutteth vp his
compassion from him, howe dwelleth the
loue of God in him? 18 My litle children,
let vs not loue in worde, neither in tongue
onely, but in deede and in trueth. 19 For
thereby we know that we are of the
trueth, and shall before him assure our
hearts. 20 For if our heart condemne
vs, God is greater then our heart, and
knoweth all things. 21 Beloued, if our
heart condemne vs not, then haue we
boldnes toward God. 22 And whatsoeuer
we aske we receiue of him, because we
keepe his commandements, and do those
things which are pleasing in his sight.
23 This is then his commandement, That
we beleeue in the Name of his Sonne Iesus
61 John 3:24
1073
Christ, and loue one another as hee gaue
commandement. 24 For hee that keepeth
his commandements, dwelleth in him,
and he in him: and hereby we knowe
that hee abideth in vs, euen by that Spirit
which he hath giuen vs.
1 Dearely
4
beloued, beleeue not euery
spirit, but trie the spirits whether they
are of God: for many false prophets are
gone out into this worlde. 2 Hereby shall
ye know the Spirit of God, Euery spirit
which confesseth that Iesus Christ is come
in the flesh, is of God. 3 And euery spirit
that confesseth not that Iesus Christ is
come in the flesh, is not of God: but this
is the spirit of Antichrist, of whome ye
haue heard, how that he should come,
and nowe already he is in this world.
4 Litle children, ye are of God, and haue
ouercome them: for greater is he that
is in you, then he that is in this world.
5 They are of this worlde, therefore speake
they of this world, and this world heareth
them. 6 We are of God, he that knoweth
God, heareth vs: he that is not of God,
heareth vs not. Heereby knowe wee the
spirit of trueth, and the spirit of errour.
7 Beloued, let vs loue one another: for
loue commeth of God, and euery one that
loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth
God. 8 Hee that loueth not, knoweth not
God: for God is loue. 9 Herein was that
loue of God made manifest amongst vs,
because God sent that his onely begotten
sonne into this world, that we might liue
through him. 10 Herein is that loue, not
that we loued God, but that he loued vs,
and sent his Sonne to be a reconciliation
for our sinnes. 11 Beloued, if God so loued
vs, we ought also to loue one another.
12 No man hath seene God at any time.
If we loue one another, God dwelleth in
vs, and his loue is perfect in vs. 13 Hereby
know we, that we dwell in him, and he
in vs: because he hath giuen vs of his
Spirit. 14 And we haue seene, and doe
testifie, that the Father sent that Sonne to
be ye Sauiour of the world. 15 Whosoeuer
confesseth that Iesus is the Sone of God, in
him dwelleth God, and he in God. 16 And
1 John 5:11
we haue knowen, and beleeued ye loue
that God hath in vs. God is loue, and he
that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God,
and God in him. 17 Herein is that loue
perfect in vs, that we should haue boldnes
in the day of iudgement: for as he is,
euen so are we in this world. 18 There is
no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth
out feare: for feare hath painefulnesse:
and he that feareth, is not perfect in loue.
19 We loue him, because he loued vs first.
20 If any man say, I loue God, and hate
his brother, he is a liar: for how can he
that loueth not his brother whom he hath
seene, loue God whom he hath not seene?
21 And this commandement haue we of
him, that he that loueth God, should loue
his brother also.
5
1 Whosoeuer beleeueth that Iesus is that
Christ, is borne of God: and euery one
that loueth him, which begate, loueth him
also which is begotten of him. 2 In this
we know that we loue the children of
God, when we loue God, and keepe his
commandements. 3 For this is the loue
of God, that we keepe his commande-
ments: and his commandements are not
burdenous. 4 For all that is borne of
God, ouercommeth this world: and this
is that victorie that hath ouercome this
world, euen our faith. 5 Who is it that
ouercommeth this world, but he which
beleeueth that Iesus is that Sonne of God?
6 This is that Iesus Christ that came by
water and blood: not by water onely, but
by water and blood: and it is that Spirit,
that beareth witnesse: for that Spirit is
trueth. 7 For there are three, which beare
recorde in heauen, the Father, the Worde,
and the holy Ghost: and these three are
one. 8 And there are three, which beare
record in the earth, the spirit, and the
water and the blood: and these three
agree in one. 9 If we receiue the witnesse
of men, the witnesse of God is greater:
for this is the witnesse of God, which he
testified of his Sonne. 10 He that beleeueth
in that Sonne of God, hath the witnes in
himselfe: he that beleeueth not God, hath
made him a lyar, because he beleeued not
ye record, that God witnessed of that his
Sonne. 11 And this is that record, to wit,1 John 5:12
1074
that God hath giuen vnto vs eternall life,
and this life is in that his Sonne. 12 He that
hath that Sonne, hath that life: and he
that hath not that Sonne of God, hath not
that life. 13 These things haue I written
vnto you, that beleeue in the Name of
that Sonne of God, that ye may knowe
that ye haue eternall life, and that ye
may beleeue in the Name of that Sonne
of God. 14 And this is that assurance,
that we haue in him, that if we aske any
thing according to his will, he heareth vs.
15 And if we know that he heareth vs,
whatsoeuer we aske, we know that we
haue the petitions, that we haue desired
of him. 16 If any man see his brother sinne
a sinne that is not vnto death, let him
aske, and he shall giue him life for them
that sinne not vnto death. There is a sinne
vnto death: I say not that thou shouldest
pray for it. 17 All vnrighteousnesse is
sinne, but there is a sinne not vnto death.
18 We know that whosoeuer is borne of
God, sinneth not: but he that is begotten
of God, keepeth himselfe, and that wicked
one toucheth him not. 19 We knowe that
we are of God, and this whole world lieth
in wickednesse. 20 But we know that that
Sone of God is come, and hath giue vs a
mind to know him, which is true: and we
are in him that is true, that is, in that
his Sone Iesus Christ: this same is that
very God, and that eternal life. 21 Litle
children, keepe your selues from idoles,
Amen.

THE SECOND EPISTLE
OF JOHN
1 THE
ELDER to the elect Lady, and
her children, whom I loue in the trueth:
and not I onely, but also all that haue
knowen the trueth, 2 For the trueths sake
which dwelleth in vs, and shalbe with vs
for euer: 3 Grace be with you, mercie
and peace from God the Father, and
from the Lord Iesus Christ the Sonne of
the Father, with trueth and loue. 4 I
reioyced greatly, that I founde of thy
children walking in trueth, as we haue
receiued a commandement of the Father.
5 And nowe beseeche I thee, Lady, (not
as writing a newe commandement vnto
thee, but that same which we had from
the beginning) that we loue one another.
6 And this is that loue, that we should
walke after his commandements. This
commandement is, that as ye haue heard
from the beginning, ye should walke in
it. 7 For many deceiuers are entred into
this worlde, which confesse not that Iesus
Christ is come in the flesh. He that is
such one, is a deceiuer and an Antichrist.
8 Looke to your selues, that we lose not
the things which we haue done, but that
we may receiue full reward. 9 Whosoeuer
transgresseth, and abideth not in the
doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that
continueth in the doctrine of Christ, he
hath both the Father and the Sonne. 10 If
there come any vnto you, and bring not
this doctrine, receiue him not to house,
neither bid him, God speede: 11 For he
that biddeth him, God speede, is partaker
of his euill deedes. Although I had many
things to write vnto you, yet I woulde not
write with paper and ynke: but I trust
to come vnto you, and speake mouth to
mouth, that our ioy may be full. 12 The
sonnes of thine elect sister greete thee,
Amen.
2 John 123 John 1

THE THIRD EPISTLE OF
JOHN
1 The
Elder vnto the beloued Gaius,
whom I loue in the trueth. 2 Beloued,
I wish chiefly that thou prosperedst and
faredst well as thy soule prospereth. 3 For
I reioyced greatly when the brethren
came, and testified of the trueth that is
in thee, how thou walkest in the trueth.
4 I haue no greater ioy then these, that
is, to heare that my sonnes walke in
veritie. 5 Beloued, thou doest faithfully,
whatsoeuer thou doest to the brethren,
and to strangers, 6 Which bare witnesse
of thy loue before the Churches. Whom
if thou bringest on their iourney as it
beseemeth according to God, thou shalt
doe well, 7 Because that for his Names
sake they went forth, and tooke nothing
of the Gentiles. 8 We therefore ought to
receiue such, that we might be helpers to
the trueth. 9 I wrote vnto the Church: but
Diotrephes which loueth to haue the pre-
eminence among them, receiueth vs not.
10 Wherefore if I come, I will call to your
remembrance his deedes which he doeth,
pratling against vs with malicious wordes,
and not therewith content, neither he
himselfe receiueth the brethren, but for-
biddeth them that woulde, and thrusteth
them out of the Church. 11 Beloued, follow
not that which is euill, but that which is
good: he that doeth well, is of God: but
he that doeth euill, hath not seene God.
12 Demetrius hath good report of al men,
and of the trueth it selfe: yea, and wee
our selues beare recorde, and ye know
that our record is true. 13 I haue many
things to write: but I will not with yncke
and pen write vnto thee: 14 For I trust I
shall shortly see thee, and we shall speake
mouth to mouth. Peace be with thee. The
friends salute thee. Greete the friends by
name.
3 John 14Jude 1
1077
THE GENERAL EPISTLE
OF JUDE
1 IVde a seruaunt of Iesus Christ, and
brother of Iames, to them which are
called and sanctified of God the Father,
and returned to Iesus Christ: 2 Mercie
vnto you, and peace and loue be multi-
plied. 3 Beloued, when I gaue al diligece to
write vnto you of the common saluation,
it was needful for me to write vnto you
to exhort you, that yee should earnestly
contend for the maintenace of ye faith,
which was once giuen vnto the Saintes.
4 For there are certaine men crept in,
which were before of olde ordeined to
this condemnation: vngodly men they
are which turne the grace of our God
into wantonnesse, and denie God the
onely Lord, and our Lord Iesus Christ.
5 I wil therfore put you in remebrance,
forasmuch as ye once knew this, how
that the Lord, after that he had deliuered
the people out of Egypt, destroied them
afterward which beleeued not. 6 The
Angels also which kept not their first
estate, but left their owne habitation,
hee hath reserued in euerlasting chaines
vnder darkenesse vnto the iudgement of
the great day. 7 As Sodom and Gomorrhe,
and the cities about them, which in like
maner as they did, committed fornica-
tion, and followed strange flesh, are set
foorth for an ensample, and suffer the
vengeance of eternall fire. 8 Likewise
notwithstanding these sleepers also defile
the flesh, and despise gouernment, and
speake euill of them that are in authoritie.
9 Yet Michael the Archangell, when hee
stroue against the deuill, and disputed
about the body of Moses, durst not blame
him with cursed speaking, but sayd, The
Lord rebuke thee. 10 But these speake
euill of those thinges, which they know
not: and whatsoeuer things they know
naturally, as beasts, which are without
reason, in those things they corrupt them
selues. 11 Wo be vnto them: for they
haue followed the way of Cain, and are
Jude 25
cast away by the deceit of Balaams wages,
and perish in the gainsaying of Core.
12 These are rockes in your feasts of
charitie when they feast with you, with-
out al feare, feeding themselues: cloudes
they are without water, caried about of
windes, corrupt trees and without fruit,
twise dead, and plucked vp by ye rootes.
13 They are the raging waues of the sea,
foming out their owne shame: they are
wandring starres, to whome is reserued
the blackenesse of darkenesse for euer.
14 And Enoch also the seuenth from Adam,
prophecied of such, saying, Beholde, the
Lord commeth with thousands of his
Saints, 15 To giue iudgement against al
men, and to rebuke all the vngodly among
them of all their wicked deeds, which they
haue vngodly committed, and of all their
cruel speakings, which wicked sinners
haue spoken against him. 16 These are
murmurers, complainers, walking after
their owne lustes: Whose mouthes speake
proud things, hauing mens persons in
admiration, because of aduantage. 17 But,
yee beloued, remember the wordes which
were spoken before of the Apostles of our
Lord Iesus Christ, 18 How that they told
you that there should be mockers in ye
last time, which should walke after their
owne vngodly lustes. 19 These are they
that separate them selues from other,
naturall, hauing not the Spirit. 20 But,
yee beloued, edifie your selues in your
most holy faith, praying in the holy Ghost,
21 And keepe your selues in the loue of
God, looking for the mercie of our Lord
Iesus Christ, vnto eternall life. 22 And
haue compassion of some, in putting
difference: 23 And other saue with feare,
pulling them out of the fire, and hate euen
that garment which is spotted by the flesh.
24 Nowe vnto him that is able to keepe
you, that ye fall not, and to present you
faultlesse before the presence of his glorie
with ioy, 25 That is, to God only wise,
our Sauiour, be glorie, and maiestie, and
dominion, and power, both nowe and for
euer, Amen.Revelation 1:1

THE REVELATION OF ST.
JOHN THE DIVINE
1 The Reuelation of Iesus Christ, which
God gaue vnto him, to shewe vnto his
seruants things which must shortly be
done: which he sent, and shewed by
his Angel vnto his seruant Iohn, 2 Who
bare record of ye word of God, and of
the testimonie of Iesus Christ, and of
all things that he saw. 3 Blessed is he
that readeth, and they that heare the
wordes of this prophecie, and keepe those
things which are written therein: for the
time is at hand. 4 Iohn, to the seuen
Churches which are in Asia, Grace be
with you, and peace from him, Which
is, and Which was, and Which is to
come, and from the seuen Spirits which
are before his Throne, 5 And from Iesus
Christ, which is that faithful witnes, and
that first begotten of the dead, and that
Prince of the Kings of the earth, vnto him
that loued vs, and washed vs from our
sinnes in his blood, 6 And made vs Kings
and Priests vnto God euen his Father, to
him I say be glory, and dominion for
euermore, Amen. 7 Beholde, he commeth
with cloudes, and euery eye shall see
him: yea, euen they which pearced him
thorowe: and all kinreds of the earth
shall waile before him, Euen so, Amen.
8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the ending, saith the Lord, Which is,
and Which was, and Which is to come,
euen the Almightie. 9 I Iohn, euen your
brother, and companion in tribulation,
and in the kingdome and patience of Iesus
Christ, was in the yle called Patmos, for
the worde of God, and for the witnessing
of Iesus Christ. 10 And I was rauished
in spirit on the Lordes day, and heard
behinde me a great voyce, as it had bene
of a trumpet, 11 Saying, I am Alpha and
Omega, that first and that last: and that
which thou seest, write in a booke, and
send it vnto the seuen Churches which are
in Asia, vnto Ephesus, and vnto Smyrna,
and vnto Pergamus, and vnto Thyatira,
Revelation 2:5
and vnto Sardis, and vnto Philadelphia,
and vnto Laodicea. 12 Then I turned
backe to see the voyce, that spake with
me: and when I was turned, I sawe
seuen golden candlestickes, 13 And in the
middes of the seuen candlestickes, one
like vnto the Sonne of man, clothed with
a garment downe to the feete, and girded
about the pappes with a golden girdle.
14 His head, and heares were white as
white wooll, and as snowe, and his eyes
were as a flame of fire, 15 And his feete
like vnto fine brasse, burning as in a
fornace: and his voyce as the sounde of
many waters. 16 And he had in his right
hand seuen starres: and out of his mouth
went a sharpe two edged sword: and his
face shone as the sunne shineth in his
strength. 17 And when I saw him, I fell
at his feete as dead: then he laid his right
hand vpon me, saying vnto me, Feare not:
I am that first and that last, 18 And am
aliue, but I was dead: and beholde, I am
aliue for euermore, Amen: and I haue
the keyes of hell and of death. 19 Write
the things which thou hast seene, and the
things which are, and the things which
shall come hereafter. 20 The misterie
of the seuen starres which thou sawest
in my right hand, and the seuen golden
candlestickes, is this, The seuen starres
are the Angels of the seuen Churches:
and the seuen candlestickes which thou
sawest, are the seuen Churches.
2
VNto the Angel of the Church of
Ephesus write, These things saieth he that
holdeth the seuen starres in his right
hand, and walketh in the middes of the
seuen golden candlestickes. 2 I knowe thy
workes, and thy labour, and thy patience,
and howe thou canst not beare with them
which are euill, and hast examined them
which say they are Apostles, and are not,
and hast found the liars. 3 And thou wast
burdened, and hast patience, and for my
Names sake hast laboured, and hast not
fainted. 4 Neuertheles, I haue somewhat
against thee, because thou hast left thy
first loue. 5 Remember therefore from
whence thou art fallen, and repent, and
doe the first workes: or els I will come
1Revelation 2:6
1079
against thee shortly, and will remooue thy
candlesticke out of his place, except thou
amend. 6 But this thou hast, that thou
hatest the workes of the Nicolaitanes,
which I also hate. 7 Let him that hath
an eare, heare, what the Spirite saith vnto
the Churches, To him that ouercommeth,
will I giue to eate of the tree of life which
is in the middes of the Paradise of God.
8 And vnto the Angel of the Church of
the Smyrnians write, These things saith
he that is first, and last, which was dead
and is aliue. 9 I knowe thy workes and
tribulation, and pouertie (but thou art
riche) and I knowe the blasphemie of
them, which say they are Iewes, and
are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.
10 Feare none of those things, which thou
shalt suffer: beholde, it shall come to
passe, that the deuill shall cast some of
you into prison, that ye may be tryed,
and ye shall haue tribulation tenne dayes:
be thou faithfull vnto the death, and I
will giue thee the crowne of life. 11 Let
him that hath an eare, heare what the
Spirit saith to the Churches. He that
ouercommeth, shall not be hurt of the
second death. 12 And to the Angel of the
Church, which is at Pergamus write, This
saith he which hath that sharpe sworde
with two edges. 13 I knowe thy workes
and where thou dwellest, euen where
Satans throne is, and thou keepest my
Name, and hast not denied my faith, euen
in those dayes when Antipas my faithfull
martyr was slaine among you, where
Satan dwelleth. 14 But I haue a fewe
things against thee, because thou hast
there them that maintaine the doctrine
of Balaam, which taught Balac to put a
stumbling blocke before ye children of
Israel, that they should eate of things
sacrificed vnto Idoles, and commit for-
nication. 15 Euen so hast thou them,
that maintaine the doctrine of the Nico-
laitanes, which thing I hate. 16 Repent
thy selfe, or els I will come vnto thee
shortly, and will fight against them with
the sworde of my mouth. 17 Let him
that hath an eare, heare what the Spirite
saith vnto the Churches. To him that
ouercommeth, will I giue to eate of the
Revelation 3:2
Manna that is hid, and will giue him a
white stone, and in the stone a newe
name written, which no man knoweth
sauing he that receiueth it. 18 And vnto ye
Angel of the Church which is at Thyatira
write, These things saith the Sonne of
God, which hath his eyes like vnto a flame
of fire, and his feete like fine brasse.
19 I knowe thy workes and thy loue, and
seruice, and faith, and thy patience, and
thy workes, and that they are more at the
last, then at the first. 20 Notwithstanding,
I haue a few things against thee, that
thou sufferest the woman Iezabel, which
calleth her selfe a prophetesse, to teache
and to deceiue my seruants to make them
commit fornication, and to eate meates
sacrificed vnto idoles. 21 And I gaue her
space to repent of her fornication, and
she repented not. 22 Beholde, I will cast
her into a bed, and them that commit
fornication with her, into great affliction,
except they repent them of their workes.
23 And I will kill her children with death:
and all the Churches shall know that I am
he which searche the reines and heartes:
and I will giue vnto euery one of you
according vnto your workes. 24 And vnto
you I say, the rest of them of Thyatira, As
many as haue not this learning, neither
haue knowen the deepenes of Satan (as
they speake) I will put vpon you none
other burden. 25 But that which ye haue
alreadie, hold fast till I come. 26 For
he that ouercommeth and keepeth my
workes vnto the end, to him will I giue
power ouer nations, 27 And he shall rule
them with a rodde of yron: and as the
vessels of a potter, shall they be broken.
28 Euen as I receiued of my Father, so will
I giue him the morning starre. 29 Let him
that hath an eare, heare what the Spirite
saith to the Churches.
3
ANd write vnto the Angel of the
Church which is at Sardis, These things
saith he that hath the seuen Spirits of
God, and the seuen starres, I knowe thy
workes: for thou hast a name that thou
liuest, but thou art dead. 2 Be awake, and
strengthen the things which remaine, that
1Revelation 3:3
1080
are readie to die: for I haue not found thy
workes perfite before God. 3 Remember
therefore, how thou hast receiued and
heard, and hold fast and repent.
If
therefore thou wilt not watch, I will come
on thee as a thiefe, and thou shalt not
know what houre I wil come vpon thee.
4 Notwithstanding thou hast a few names
yet in Sardis, which haue not defiled their
garments: and they shall walke with me
in white: for they are worthy. 5 He that
ouercommeth, shalbe clothed in white
araye, and I will not put out his name out
of the booke of life, but I will confesse his
name before my Father, and before his
Angels. 6 Let him that hath an eare, heare,
what the Spirite saith vnto the Churches.
7 And write vnto ye Angel of ye Church
which is of Philadelphia, These things
saith he that is Holy, and True, which hath
ye keye of Dauid, which openeth and no
man shutteth, and shutteth and no man
openeth, 8 I knowe thy workes: beholde, I
haue set before thee an open doore, and
no man can shut it: for thou hast a litle
strength and hast kept my worde, and
hast not denied my Name. 9 Behold, I
will make them of the Synagogue of Satan,
which call themselues Iewes, and are not,
but doe lye: beholde, I say, I will make
them, that they shall come and worship
before thy feete, and shall knowe that I
haue loued thee. 10 Because thou hast
kept the woorde of my patience, therefore
I wil deliuer thee from the houre of
tentation, which will come vpon all the
world, to trie them that dwell vpon the
earth. 11 Beholde, I come shortly: holde
that which thou hast, that no man take
thy crowne. 12 Him that ouercommeth,
will I make a pillar in the Temple of
my God, and he shall goe no more out:
and I will write vpon him the Name of
my God, and the name of the citie of
my God, which is the newe Hierusalem,
which commeth downe out of heauen
from my God, and I will write vpon him
my newe Name. 13 Let him that hath
an eare, heare what ye Spirit saith vnto
the Churches. 14 And vnto the Angell of
the Church of the Laodiceans write, These
Revelation 4:5
things saieth Amen, the faithfull and true
witnesse, that beginning of the creatures
of God. 15 I knowe thy woorkes, that
thou art neither colde nor hote: I woulde
thou werest colde or hote. 16 Therefore,
because thou art luke warme, and neither
colde nor hote, it will come to passe,
that I shall spewe thee out of my mouth.
17 For thou saiest, I am rich and increased
with goods, and haue neede of nothing,
and knowest not howe thou art wretched
and miserable, and poore, and blinde,
and naked. 18 I counsell thee to bye
of me gold tried by the fire, that thou
maiest bee made rich: and white raiment,
that thou maiest be clothed, and that thy
filthie nakednesse doe not appeare: and
anoynt thine eyes with eye salue, that
thou maiest see. 19 As many as I loue, I
rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore
and amend. 20 Behold, I stand at the
doore, and knocke. If any man heare my
voice and open ye doore, I wil come in
vnto him, and will suppe with him, and
he with me. 21 To him that ouercommeth,
will I graunt to sit with me in my throne,
euen as I ouercame, and sit with my
Father in his throne. 22 Let him that hath
an eare, heare what the Spirit saieth vnto
the Churches.
1 After
4
this I looked, and beholde, a
doore was open in heauen, and the first
voyce which I heard, was as it were
of a trumpet talking with mee, saying,
Come vp hither, and I will shewe thee
things which must be done hereafter.
2 And immediatly I was rauished in the
spirit, and behold, a throne was set in
heauen, and one sate vpon the throne.
3 And he that sate, was to looke vpon,
like vnto a iasper stone, and a sardine,
and there was a rainbowe rounde about
the throne, in sight like to an emeraude.
4 And round about the throne were foure
and twentie seates, and vpon the seates
I sawe foure and twentie Elders sitting,
clothed in white raiment, and had on
their heads crownes of golde. 5 And out
of the throne proceeded lightnings, and
thundrings, and voyces, and there wereRevelation 4:6
1081
seuen lampes of fire burning before the
throne, which are the seuen spirits of
God. 6 And before the throne there was
a sea of glasse like vnto chrystall: and
in the middes of the throne, and round
about the throne were foure beasts full
of eyes before and behinde. 7 And the
first beast was like a lion, and the second
beast like a calfe, and the thirde beast
had a face as a man, and the fourth
beast was like a flying Eagle. 8 And the
foure beasts had eche one of them sixe
wings about him, and they were full of
eyes within, and they ceased not day
nor night, saying, Holy, holy, holy Lord
God almighty, Which Was, and Which
Is, and Which Is to come. 9 And when
those beasts gaue glorie, and honour, and
thanks to him that sate on the throne,
which liueth for euer and euer, 10 The
foure and twentie Elders fell downe be-
fore him that sate on the throne and
worshipped him that liueth for euermore,
and cast their crownes before the throne,
saying, 11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to
receiue glory and honour, and power:
for thou hast created all things, and for
thy wils sake they are, and haue beene
created.
5
1 And I saw in the right hand of him
that sate vpon the throne, a Booke written
within, and on the backside, sealed with
seuen seales. 2 And I sawe a strong Angell
which preached with a loud voice, Who is
worthy to open ye booke, and to loose the
seales thereof? 3 And no man in heauen,
nor in earth, neither vnder the earth, was
able to open the Booke, neither to looke
thereon. 4 Then I wept much, because
no man was foud worthy to open, and to
reade the Booke, neither to looke thereon.
5 And one of the Elders saide vnto me,
Weepe not: beholde, that Lion which is
of the tribe of Iuda, that roote of Dauid,
hath obteined to open the Booke, and to
loose the seuen seales thereof. 6 Then I
behelde, and loe, in the middes of the
throne, and of the foure beasts, and in
the mids of the Elders, stoode a Labe as
though he had bene killed, which had
seuen hornes, and seuen eyes, which are
Revelation 6:4
the seuen spirites of God, sent into all the
world. 7 And hee came, and tooke the
Booke out of the right hand of him that
sate vpon the throne. 8 And when he had
taken ye Booke, ye foure beasts and the
foure and twenty Elders fel downe before
the Lambe, hauing euery one harps and
golden vials full of odours, which are the
praiers of the Saintes, 9 And they sung
a new song, saying, Thou art worthie to
take the Booke, and to open the seales
thereof, because thou wast killed, and
hast redeemed vs to God by thy blood
out of euery kinred, and tongue, and
people, and nation, 10 And hast made
vs vnto our God Kings and Priests, and
we shall reigne on the earth. 11 Then I
behelde, and I heard the voice of many
Angels round about the throne, and about
the beastes and the Elders, and there
were ten thousand times ten thousand,
and thousand thousands, 12 Saying with
a loude voice, Worthie is the Lambe that
was killed to receiue power, and riches,
and wisdome, and strength, and honour,
and glory, and praise. 13 And al the
creatures which are in heauen, and on the
earth, and vnder the earth, and in the sea,
and al that are in them, heard I, saying,
Praise, and honour, and glory, and power
be vnto him, that sitteth vpon the throne,
and vnto the Lambe for euermore. 14 And
the foure beasts said, Amen, and the
foure and twentie Elders fell downe and
worshipped him that liueth for euermore.
1 After,
6
I beheld whe the Lambe had
opened one of the seales, and I heard
one of the foure beastes say, as it were
the noise of thunder, Come and see.
2 Therefore I behelde, and loe, there was
a white horse, and hee that sate on him,
had a bowe, and a crowne was giuen
vnto him, and he went forth conquering
that he might ouercome. 3 And when he
had opened the seconde seale, I heard the
second beast say, Come and see. 4 And
there went out an other horse, that was
red, and power was giuen to him that
sate thereon, to take peace from the earth,
and that they should kill one another,Revelation 6:5
1082
and there was giuen vnto him a great
sword. 5 And when hee had opened
the thirde seale, I heard the thirde beast
say, Come and see: Then I behelde, and
loe, a blacke horse, and he that sate on
him, had balances in his hand. 6 And I
heard a voice in the mids of the foure
beastes say, A measure of wheate for a
penie, and three measures of barly for
a peny, and oyle, and wine hurt thou
not. 7 And when he had opened the
fourth seale, I heard the voice of the
fourth beast say, Come and see. 8 And I
looked, and beholde, a pale horse, and his
name that sate on him was Death, and
Hell folowed after him, and power was
giuen vnto them ouer the fourth part of
the earth, to kill with sworde, and with
hunger, and with death, and with beasts
of the earth. 9 And when hee had opened
the fifth seale, I sawe vnder the altar
the soules of them, that were killed for
the worde of God, and for the testimonie
which they mainteined. 10 And they cried
with a loud voice, saying, How long, Lord,
which art holie and true! doest not thou
iudge and auenge our blood on them
that dwell on the earth? 11 And long
white robes were giuen vnto euery one,
and it was saide vnto them, that they
shoulde rest for a litle season vntill their
fellow seruants, and their brethren that
shoulde bee killed euen as they were,
were fulfilled. 12 And I behelde when hee
had opened the sixt seale, and loe, there
was a great earthquake, and the sunne
was as blacke as sackecloth of heare, and
the moone was like blood. 13 And the
starres of heauen fell vnto the earth, as a
figge tree casteth her greene figges when
it is shaken of a mightie winde. 14 And
heauen departed away, as a scroule,
when it is rolled, and euery mountaine
and yle were mooued out of their places.
15 And the Kinges of the earth, and the
great men, and the rich men, and the
chiefe captaines, and the mighty men,
and euery bondman, and euery free man,
hid themselues in dennes, and among the
rockes of the mountaines, 16 And said to
the mountaines and rocks, Fal on vs, and
hide vs from the presence of him that
Revelation 7:12
sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath
of the Lambe. 17 For the great day of his
wrath is come, and who can stand?
1 And after that,
7
I sawe foure Angels
stand on the foure corners of the earth,
holding the foure windes of the earth,
that the winds should not blow on the
earth, neither on the sea, neither on
any tree. 2 And I sawe another Angel
come vp from the East, which had the
seale of the liuing God, and hee cried
with a loud voice to the foure Angels to
who power was giuen to hurt the earth,
and the sea, saying, 3 Hurt ye not the
earth, neither the sea, neither the trees,
til we haue sealed the seruants of our
God in their foreheads. 4 And I heard the
number of them, which were sealed, and
there were sealed an hundreth and foure
and fourtie thousand of all the tribes of
the children of Israel. 5 Of the tribe of
Iuda were sealed twelue thousande. Of
the tribe of Ruben were sealed twelue
thousande. Of the tribe of Gad were
sealed twelue thousande. 6 Of the tribe
of Aser were sealed twelue thousand. Of
the tribe of Nephthali were sealed twelue
thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were
sealed twelue thousand. 7 Of the tribe
of Simeon were sealed twelue thousande.
Of the tribe of Leui were sealed twelue
thousande. Of the tribe of Issachar were
sealed twelue thousand. Of the tribe of
Zabulon were sealed twelue thousand.
8 Of the tribe of Ioseph were sealed twelue
thousande. Of the tribe of Beniamin
were sealed twelue thousand. 9 After
these thinges I behelde, and loe a great
multitude, which no man coulde number,
of all nations and kindreds, and people,
and tongues, stoode before the throne,
and before the Lambe, clothed with long
white robes, and palmes in their hands.
10 And they cried with a loud voice,
saying, Saluation commeth of our God,
that sitteth vpon the throne, and of the
Lambe. 11 And all the Angels stoode
rounde about the throne, and about the
Elders, and the foure beastes, and they
fell before the throne on their faces, and
worshipped God, 12 Saying, Amen. Praise,
and glorie, and wisdom, and thankes, andRevelation 7:13
1083
honour, and power, and might bee vnto
our God for euermore, Amen. 13 And one
of the Elders spake, saying vnto me, What
are these which are araied in log white
robes? and whence came they? 14 And I
saide vnto him, Lord, thou knowest. And
he saide to me, These are they, which
came out of great tribulation, and haue
washed their long robes, and haue made
their long robes white in the blood of
the Lambe. 15 Therefore are they in the
presence of the throne of God, and serue
him day and night in his Temple, and
he that sitteth on the throne, wil dwell
among them. 16 They shall hunger no
more, neither thirst any more, neither
shall the sunne light on them, neither
any heate. 17 For the Lambe, which is in
the middes of the throne, shall gouerne
them, and shall leade them vnto the liuely
fountaines of waters, and God shall wipe
away all teares from their eyes.
8
1 And when he had opened the seuenth
seale, there was silence in heauen about
halfe an houre. 2 And I sawe the seuen
Angels, which stoode before God, and to
them were giuen seuen trumpets. 3 Then
another Angel came and stoode before
the altar hauing a golden censer, and
much odours was giuen vnto him, that
hee shoulde offer with the prayers of all
Saintes vpon the golden altar, which is
before the throne. 4 And the smoke of
the odours with the prayers of the Saintes,
went vp before God, out of the Angels
hand. 5 And the Angel tooke the censer,
and filled it with fire of the altar, and
cast it into the earth, and there were
voyces, and thundrings, and lightnings,
and earthquake. 6 Then the seuen Angels,
which had the seuen trumpets, prepared
themselues to blow the trumpets. 7 So
the first Angell blewe the trumpet, and
there was haile and fire, mingled with
blood, and they were cast into the earth,
and the thirde part of trees was burnt,
and all greene grasse was burnt. 8 And
the second Angel blew the trumpet, and
as it were a great mountaine, burning
Revelation 9:5
with fire, was cast into the sea, and
the thirde part of the sea became blood.
9 And the thirde part of the creatures,
which were in the sea, and had life,
died, and the thirde part of shippes were
destroyed. 10 Then the thirde Angel blew
the trumpet, and there fell a great starre
from heauen, burning like a torche, and it
fell into the thirde part of the riuers, and
into the fountaines of waters. 11 And the
name of the starre is called wormewood:
therefore the thirde part of the waters
became wormewood, and many men died
of the waters, because they were made
bitter. 12 And the fourth Angel blew
the trumpet, and the thirde part of the
sunne was smitten, and the thirde part
of the moone, and the thirde part of the
starres, so that the thirde part of them
was darkened: and the day was smitten,
that the thirde part of it could not shine,
and likewise the night. 13 And I beheld,
and heard one Angel flying thorow the
middes of heauen, saying with a loude
voyce, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants
of the earth, because of the sounds to
come of the trumpet of the three Angels,
which were yet to blowe the trumpets.
9
1 And the fifth Angel blew the trumpet,
and I saw a starre fall from heauen vnto
the earth, and to him was giuen the
key of the bottomlesse pit. 2 And he
opened the bottomlesse pit, and there
arose the smoke of the pit, as the smoke
of a great fornace, and the sunne, and
the ayre were darkened by the smoke
of the pit. 3 And there came out of the
smoke Locustes vpon the earth, and vnto
them was giuen power, as the scorpions
of the earth haue power. 4 And it was
comanded them, that they should not
hurt the grasse of the earth, neither any
greene thing, neither any tree: but onely
those men which haue not the seale of
God in their foreheads. 5 And to them
was comanded that they should not kill
them, but that they should be vexed fiue
moneths, and that their paine should be
as the paine that commeth of a scorpion,Revelation 9:6
1084
when he hath stung a man. 6 Therefore
in those dayes shall men seeke death, and
shall not finde it, and shall desire to die,
and death shall flie from them. 7 And
the forme of the locustes was like vnto
horses prepared vnto battel, and on their
heads were as it were crownes, like vnto
golde, and their faces were like the faces
of men. 8 And they had heare as the
heare of women, and their teeth were
as the teeth of lyons. 9 And they had
habbergions, like to habbergions of yron:
and the soud of their wings was like the
sound of charets whe many horses runne
vnto battel. 10 And they had tailes like
vnto scorpions, and there were stings in
their tailes, and their power was to hurt
men fiue moneths. 11 And they haue
a King ouer them, which is the Angel
of the bottomlesse pit, whose name in
Hebrewe is Abaddon, and in Greeke he
is named Apollyon, that is, destroying.
12 One woe is past, and beholde, yet two
woes come after this. 13 Then the sixt
Angel blew the trumpet, and I heard a
voyce from the foure hornes of the golden
altar, which is before God, 14 Saying to the
sixt Angel, which had the trumpet, Loose
the foure Angels, which are bound in the
great riuer Euphrates. 15 And the foure
Angels were loosed, which were prepared
at an houre, at a day, at a moneth, and
at a yeere, to slay the thirde part of
men. 16 And the nomber of horsemen
of warre were twentie thousand times
ten thousand: for I heard the nomber
of them. 17 And thus I saw the horses
in a vision, and them that sate on them,
hauing firie habbergions, and of Iacinth,
and of brimstone, and the heads of the
horses were as the heades of lyons: and
out of their mouthes went foorth fire and
smoke and brimstone. 18 Of these three
was the thirde part of men killed, that
is, of the fire, and of the smoke, and of
the brimstone, which came out of their
mouthes. 19 For their power is in their
mouths, and in their tailes: for their tailes
were like vnto serpents, and had heades,
wherewith they hurt. 20 And the remnant
of the men which were not killed by these
plagues, repented not of the works of
Revelation 10:11
their handes that they should not worship
deuils, and idoles of golde and of siluer,
and of brasse, and of stone, and of wood,
which neither can see, neither heare nor
goe. 21 Also they repented not of their
murder, and of their sorcerie, neither of
their fornication, nor of their theft.
1 And
10
I sawe another mightie Angel
come downe from heauen, clothed with
a cloude, and the raine bowe vpon his
head, and his face was as the sunne, and
his feete as pillars of fire. 2 And hee
had in his hande a little booke open, and
he put his right foote vpon the sea, and
his left on the earth, 3 And cried with
a loude voyce, as when a lyon roareth:
and when he had cried, seuen thunders
vttered their voyces. 4 And whe the seuen
thunders had vttered their voyces, I was
about to write: but I heard a voice from
heauen saying vnto me, Seale vp those
things which the seuen thunders haue
spoken, and write them not. 5 And the
Angel which I sawe stand vpon the sea,
and vpon the earth, lift vp his hand to
heauen, 6 And sware by him that liueth
for euermore, which created heauen, and
the thinges that therein are, and the earth,
and the things that therein are, and the
sea, and the thinges that therein are, that
time should be no more. 7 But in the dayes
of the voyce of the seuenth Angel, when
he shall beginne to blow the trumpet,
euen the mysterie of God shalbe finished,
as he hath declared to his seruants the
Prophets. 8 And the voyce which I heard
from heauen, spake vnto me againe, and
said, Go and take the litle booke which
is open in the hand of the Angel, which
standeth vpon the sea and vpon the earth.
9 So I went vnto the Angel, and saide
to him, Giue me the litle booke. And
he said vnto me, Take it, and eate it vp,
and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it
shalbe in thy mouth as sweete as honie.
10 Then I tooke the litle booke out of ye
Angels hand, and ate it vp, and it was in
my mouth as sweete as hony: but whe I
had eaten it my belly was bitter. 11 AndRevelation 11:1
1085
Revelation 12:4
he said vnto me, Thou must prophecie vnto them, Come vp hither. And they
againe among the people and nations, shall ascend vp to heauen in a cloude,
and tongues, and to many Kings.
and their enemies shall see them. 13 And
the same houre shall there bee a great
earthquake, and the tenth part of the citie
11
shall fall, and in the earthquake shalbe

2 But the court which is without the
third woe will come anon. 15 And the
temple cast out, and mete it not: for seuenth Angell blewe the trumpet, and
it is giuen vnto the Gentiles, and the there were great voyces in heauen, say-
holy citie shall they treade vnder foote, ing, The kingdomes of this worlde are
two and fourtie moneths. 3 But I wil our Lordes, and his Christes, and he shall
giue power vnto my two witnesses, and reigne for euermore. 16 Then the foure
they shall prophecie a thousande two and twentie Elders, which sate before God
hundreth and threescore dayes, clothed on their seates, fell vpon their faces, and
in sackcloth. 4 These are two oliue trees, worshipped God, 17 Saying, We giue thee
and two candlestickes, standing before thankes, Lord God almightie, Which art,
the God of the earth. 5 And if any man and Which wast, and Which art to come:
wil hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their for thou hast receiued thy great might,
mouthes, and deuoureth their enemies: and hast obteined thy kingdome. 18 And
for if any man would hurt the, thus must the Gentiles were angrie, and thy wrath
he be killed. 6 These haue power to shut is come, and the time of the dead, that

smite the earth with all maner plagues, them that feare thy Name, to small and
as often as they will. 7 And when they great, and shouldest destroy them, which
haue finished their testimonie, the beast destroy the earth. 19 Then the Temple
that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, of God was opened in heauen, and there
shall make warre against them, and shall was seene in his Temple the Arke of his
ouercome them, and kill them. 8 And couenant: and there were lightnings, and
their corpses shall lie in the streetes of voyces, and thundrings, and earthquake,

1 And there appeared a great wonder
and kinreds, and tongues, and Gentiles
shall see their corpses three dayes and an in heauen: A woman clothed with the
halfe, and shall not suffer their carkeises sunne, and the moone was vnder her
to be put in graues. 10 And they that dwell feete, and vpon her head a crowne of
vpon the earth, shall reioyce ouer them twelue starres. 2 And she was with childe,
and be glad, and shall sende giftes one to and cried traueiling in birth, and was
an other: for these two Prophets vexed pained readie to be deliuered. 3 And
them that dwelt on the earth. 11 But after there appeared another wonder in heaue:
three dayes and an halfe, the spirit of for beholde, a great red dragon hau-
life comming from God, shall enter into ing seuen heads, and ten hornes, and
them, and they shall stande vp vpon their seuen crownes vpon his heads: 4 And
feete: and great feare shall come vpon his taile drew the thirde part of the
them which sawe them. 12 And they shall starres of heauen, and cast them to the
heare a great voyce from heauen, saying earth. And the dragon stood before theRevelation 12:5
1086
woman, which was ready to be deliuered,
to deuoure her childe, when shee had
brought it foorth. 5 So shee brought
foorth a man childe, which should rule
all nations with a rod of yron: and that
her childe was taken vp vnto God and
to his throne. 6 And the woman fled
into wildernes where she hath a place
prepared of God, that they should feede
her there a thousande, two hundreth and
three score dayes. 7 And there was a
battell in heauen, Michael and his An-
gels fought against the dragon, and the
dragon fought and his angels. 8 But they
preuailed not, neither was their place
found any more in heauen. 9 And the
great dragon, that olde serpent, called
the deuil and Satan, was cast out, which
deceiueth all the world: he was euen cast
into the earth, and his angels were cast
out with him. 10 Then I heard a loude
voyce in heauen, saying, Now is salua-
tion, and strength, and the kingdome of
our God, and the power of his Christ:
for the accuser of our brethren is cast
downe, which accused them before our
God day and night. 11 But they ouercame
him by that blood of that Lambe, and
by that worde of their testimonie, and
they loued not their liues vnto the death.
12 Therefore reioyce, ye heauens, and ye
that dwell in them. Wo to the inhabitants
of the earth, and of the sea: for the deuill
is come downe vnto you, which hath great
wrath, knowing that he hath but a short
time. 13 And when the dragon sawe that
hee was cast vnto the earth, he persecuted
the woman which had brought forth the
man childe. 14 But to the woman were
giuen two wings of a great eagle, that
she might flie into the wildernes, into
her place, where she is nourished for a
time, and times, and halfe a time, from
the presence of the serpent. 15 And the
serpent cast out of his mouth water after
the woman, like a flood, that he might
cause her to be caried away of the flood.
16 But the earth holpe the woman, and the
earth opened her mouth, and swalowed
vp the flood, which the dragon had cast
out of his mouth. 17 Then the dragon
was wroth with the woman, and went
Revelation 13:14
and made warre with the remnant of her
seede, which keepe the comaundements
of God, and haue the testimonie of Iesus
Christ. 18 And I stood on the sea sand.
13
1 And I saw a beast rise out of the sea,
hauing seuen heads, and ten hornes, and
vpon his hornes were ten crownes, and
vpon his heads the name of blasphemie.
2 And the beast which I sawe, was like a
Leopard, and his feete like a beares, and
his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and
the dragon gaue him his power and his
throne, and great authoritie. 3 And I sawe
one of his heads as it were wounded to
death, but his deadly wound was healed,
and all the world wondred and folowed
the beast. 4 And they worshipped the
dragon which gaue power vnto the beast,
and they worshipped the beast, saying,
Who is like vnto the beast! who is able
to warre with him! 5 And there was
giuen vnto him a mouth, that spake great
things and blasphemies, and power was
giuen vnto him, to doe two and fourtie
moneths. 6 And he opened his mouth vnto
blasphemie against God, to blaspheme his
Name, and his tabernacle, and them that
dwell in heauen. 7 And it was giuen vnto
him to make warre with the Saints, and
to ouercome them, and power was giuen
him ouer euery kinred, and tongue, and
nation. 8 Therefore all that dwell vpon the
earth, shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the booke of life of
that Lambe, which was slaine from the
beginning of the world. 9 If any man haue
an eare, let him heare. 10 If any leade into
captiuitie, hee shall go into captiuitie: if
any kill with a sword, he must be killed
by a sword: here is the patience and the
faith of the Saints. 11 And I beheld another
beast comming vp out of the earth, which
had two hornes like the Lambe, but he
spake like the dragon. 12 And he did all
that the first beast could doe before him,
and he caused the earth, and them which
dwell therein, to worship the first beast,
whose deadly wound was healed. 13 And
he did great wonders, so that hee made
fire to come downe from heauen on the
earth, in the sight of men, 14 And deceiuedRevelation 13:15
1087
them that dwell on the earth by the signes,
which were permitted to him to doe in
the sight of the beast, saying to them that
dwell on the earth, that they should make
the image of the beast, which had the
wound of a sword, and did liue. 15 And it
was permitted to him to giue a spirit vnto
the image of the beast, so that the image
of the beast should speake, and should
cause that as many as would not worship
the image of the beast, should be killed.
16 And he made all, both small and great,
rich and poore, free and bond, to receiue
a marke in their right hand or in their
foreheads, 17 And that no man might buy
or sell, saue hee that had the marke, or
the name of the beast, or the number of
his name. 18 Here is wisdome. Let him
that hath wit, count the number of the
beast: for it is the number of a man, and
his number is sixe hundreth threescore
and sixe.
14
Then I looked, and lo, a Lambe
stood on mount Sion, and with him an
hundreth, fourtie and foure thousand,
hauing his Fathers Name written in their
foreheads. 2 And I heard a voyce from
heauen, as the sound of many waters,
and as the sound of a great thunder:
and I heard the voyce of harpers harping
with their harpes. 3 And they sung as
it were a newe song before the throne,
and before the foure beasts, and the
Elders: and no man could learne that
song, but the hundreth, fourtie and foure
thousand, which were bought from the
earth. 4 These are they, which are not
defiled with women: for they are virgins:
these follow the Lambe whithersoeuer
he goeth: these are bought from men,
being the first fruites vnto God, and to
the Lambe. 5 And in their mouthes was
found no guile: for they are without
spot before the throne of God. 6 Then
I sawe another Angel flie in the mids of
heauen, hauing an euerlasting Gospel, to
preach vnto them that dwell on the earth,
and to euery nation, and kinred, and
tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loude
voyce, Feare God, and giue glory to him:
1
Revelation 14:19
for the houre of his iugdement is come:
and woriship him that made heauen and
earth, and the sea, and the fountaines
of waters. 8 And there followed another
Angel, saying, Babylon that great citie is
fallen, it is fallen: for she made all nations
to drinke of the wine of the wrath of
her fornication. 9 And the third Angel
followed them, saying with a loude voyce,
If any man worship the beast and his
image, and receiue his marke in his fore-
head, or on his hand, 10 The same shall
drinke of the wine of ye wrath of God,
yea, of the pure wine, which is powred
into the cup of his wrath, and he shalbe
tormented in fire and brimstone before
the holy Angels, and before the Lambe.
11 And the smoke of their torment shall
ascend euermore: and they shall haue
no rest day nor night, which worship
the beast and his image, and whosoeuer
receiueth the print of his name. 12 Here is
the patience of Saints: here are they that
keepe the commandements of God, and
the fayth of Iesus. 13 Then I heard a voyce
from heauen, saying vnto me, Write, The
dead which die in the Lord, are fully
blessed. Euen so sayth the Spirit: for they
rest from their labours, and their workes
follow them. 14 And I looked, and behold,
a white cloude, and vpon the cloude one
sitting like vnto the Sonne of man, hauing
on his head a golden crowne, and in his
hand a sharpe sickle. 15 And another
Angel came out of the Temple, crying with
a loude voyce to him that sate on the
cloude, Thrust in thy sickle and reape: for
the time is come to reape: for the haruest
of the earth is ripe. 16 And he that sate
on the cloude, thrust in his sickle on the
earth, and the earth was reaped. 17 Then
an other Angel came out of the Temple,
which is in heauen, hauing also a sharpe
sickle. 18 And another Angel came out
from the altar, which had power ouer fire,
and cryed with a loude crie to him that
had the sharpe sickle, and sayd, Thrust in
thy sharpe sickle, and gather the clusters
of the vineyard of the earth: for her
grapes are ripe. 19 And the Angel thrust
in his sharpe sickle on the earth, and cutRevelation 14:20
1088
downe the vines of the vineyard of the
earth, and cast them into that great wine
presse of the wrath of God. 20 And the
wine presse was troden without the citie,
and blood came out of the wine presse,
vnto the horse bridles, by the space of a
thousand and sixe hundreth furlongs.
15
1 And I sawe another signe in heauen,
great and marueilous, seuen Angels, hau-
ing the seuen last plagues: for by them is
fulfilled the wrath of God. 2 And I sawe
as it were a glassie sea, mingled with fire,
and them that had gotten victorie of the
beast, and of his image, and of his marke,
and of the number of his name, stand
at the glassie sea, hauing the harpes of
God, 3 And they sung the song of Moses
the seruant of God, and the song of the
Lambe, saying, Great and marueilous are
thy workes, Lord God almightie: iust
and true are thy wayes, King of Saints.
4 Who shall not feare thee, O Lord, and
glorifie thy Name! for thou onely art holy,
and all nations shall come and worship
before thee: for thy iudgements are made
manifest. 5 And after that, I looked, and
beholde, the Temple of the tabernacle of
testimonie was open in heauen. 6 And
the seuen Angels came out of the Temple,
which had the seuen plagues, clothed in
pure and bright linnen, and hauing their
breasts girded with golden girdles. 7 And
one of the foure beastes gaue vnto the
seuen Angels seuen golden vials full of the
wrath of God, which liueth for euermore.
8 And the Temple was full of the smoke
of the glory of God and of his power, and
no man was able to enter into the Temple,
till the seuen plagues of the seuen Angels
were fulfilled.
16
1 And I heard a great voyce out of the
Temple, saying to the seuen Angels, Go
your wayes, and powre out the seuen
vials of the wrath of God vpon the earth.
2 And the first went and powred out his
viall vpon the earth: and there fell a
noysome, and a grieuous sore vpon the
Revelation 16:17
men, which had the marke of ye beast,
and vpon them which worshipped his
image. 3 And the second Angel powred
out his viall vpon the sea, and it became
as the blood of a dead man: and euery
liuing thing dyed in the sea. 4 And the
third Angel powred out his viall vpon the
riuers and fountaines of waters, and they
became blood. 5 And I heard the Angel of
the waters say, Lord, thou art iust, Which
art, and Which wast: and Holy, because
thou hast iudged these things. 6 For they
shed the blood of the Saints, and Prophets,
and therefore hast thou giuen them blood
to drinke: for they are worthy. 7 And
I heard another out of the Sanctuarie
say, Euen so, Lord God almightie, true
and righteous are thy iudgements. 8 And
the fourth Angel powred out his viall on
the sunne, and it was giuen vnto him to
torment men with heate of fire, 9 And men
boyled in great heate, and blasphemed
the Name of God, which hath power ouer
these plagues, and they repented not, to
giue him glorie. 10 And the fifth Angel
powred out his viall vpon the throne
of the beast, and his kingdome waxed
darke, and they gnawed their tongues for
sorowe, 11 And blasphemed the God of
heauen for their paines, and for their
sores, and repented not of their workes.
12 And the sixth Angel powred out his viall
vpon the great riuer Euphrates, and the
water thereof dried vp, that the way of
the Kings of the East should be prepared.
13 And I sawe three vncleane spirits like
frogs come out of the mouth of that
dragon, and out of the mouth of that
beast, and out of the mouth of that false
prophet. 14 For they are the spirits of
deuils, working miracles, to go vnto the
Kings of the earth, and of the whole
world, to gather them to the battell of that
great day of God Almightie. 15 (Beholde,
I come as a theefe. Blessed is he that
watcheth and keepeth his garments, least
hee walke naked, and men see his filth-
ines) 16 And they gathered them together
into a place called in Hebrewe Arma-
gedon. 17 And the seuenth Angel powredRevelation 16:18
1089
out his viall into the ayre: and there
came a loude voyce out of the Temple
of heauen from the throne, saying, It is
done. 18 And there were voyces, and
thundrings, and lightnings, and there was
a great earthquake, such as was not since
men were vpon the earth, euen so mightie
an earthquake. 19 And the great citie was
deuided into three partes, and the cities of
the nations fell: and that great Babylon
came in remembrance before God, to
giue vnto her the cup of the wine of the
fiercenesse of his wrath. 20 And euery
yle fled away, and the mountaines were
not found. 21 And there fell a great haile,
like talents, out of heauen vpon the men,
and men blasphemed God, because of the
plague of the haile: for the plague thereof
was exceeding great.
1 Then
17
there came one of the seuen
Angels, which had the seuen vials, and
talked with me, saying vnto me, Come:
I will shewe thee the damnation of the
great whore that sitteth vpon many wa-
ters, 2 With whom haue committed for-
nication the Kings of the earth, and the
inhabitants of the earth are drunken with
the wine of her fornication. 3 So he
caried me away into the wildernesse in
the Spirit, and I sawe a woman sit vpon
a skarlet coloured beast, full of names
of blasphemie, which had seuen heads,
and tenne hornes. 4 And the woman
was arayed in purple and skarlet, and
gilded with golde, and precious stones,
and pearles, and had a cup of gold
in her hand, full of abominations, and
filthines of her fornication. 5 And in
her forehead was a name written, A
mysterie, that great Babylon, that mother
of whoredomes, and abominations of the
earth. 6 And I sawe ye woman drunken
with the blood of Saintes, and with the
blood of the Martyrs of IESVS: and when I
sawe her, I wondred with great marueile.
7 Then the Angel saide vnto me, Where-
fore marueilest thou? I will shewe thee
the misterie of that woman, and of that
beast, that beareth her, which hath seuen
heads, and tenne hornes. 8 The beast that
Revelation 18:2
thou hast seene, was, and is not, and shall
ascend out of the bottomles pit, and shall
goe into perdition, and they that dwell
on the earth, shall wonder (whose names
are not written in the booke of life from
the foundation of ye world) when they
behold the beast that was, and is not,
and yet is. 9 Here is the mind that hath
wisdome. The seuen heads, are seuen
mountaines, whereon the woman sitteth:
they are also seuen Kings. 10 Fiue are
fallen, and one is, and another is not yet
come: and when he commeth, he must
continue a short space. 11 And the beast
that was, and is not, is euen the eight,
and is one of the seuen, and shall goe
into destruction. 12 And the tenne hornes
which thou sawest, are tenne Kings,
which yet haue not receiued a kingdome,
but shall receiue power, as Kings at one
houre with the beast. 13 These haue one
minde, and shall giue their power, and
authoritie vnto the beast. 14 These shall
fight with the Lambe, and the Lambe shall
ouercome them: for he is Lord of Lordes,
and King of Kings: and they that are on
his side, called, and chosen, and faithfull.
15 And he said vnto me, The waters which
thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are
people, and multitudes, and nations, and
tongues. 16 And the tenne hornes which
thou sawest vpon the beast, are they that
shall hate the whore, and shall make her
desolate and naked, and shall eate her
flesh, and burne her with fire. 17 For God
hath put in their heartes to fulfill his will,
and to doe with one consent for to giue
their kingdome vnto the beast, vntill the
wordes of God be fulfilled. 18 And that
woman which thou sawest, is that great
citie, which reigneth ouer the kings of ye
earth.
1 And
18
after these thinges, I sawe an-
other Angel come downe from heauen,
hauing great power, so that the earth
was lightened with his glorie, 2 And he
cryed out mightily with a loud voyce,
saying, It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that
great citie, and is become the habitation
of deuils, and the holde of all fouleRevelation 18:3
1090
spirits, and a cage of euery vncleane and
hatefull birde. 3 For all nations haue
drunken of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication, and the Kings of the earth
haue committed fornication with her, and
the marchants of the earth are waxed
rich of the abundance of her pleasures.
4 And I heard another voyce from heauen
say, Goe out of her, my people, that ye
be not partakers of her sinnes, and that
ye receiue not of her plagues. 5 For
her sinnes are come vp into heauen,
and God hath remembred her iniquities.
6 Rewarde her, euen as she hath rewarded
you, and giue her double according to
her workes: and in the cup that she hath
filled to you, fill her ye double. 7 In
as much as she glorified her selfe, and
liued in pleasure, so much giue ye to
her torment and sorow: for she saith in
her heart, I sit being a queene, and am
no widowe, and shall see no mourning.
8 Therefore shall her plagues come at
one day, death, and sorowe, and famine,
and she shalbe burnt with fire: for that
God which condemneth her, is a strong
Lord. 9 And the kings of the earth shall
bewayle her, and lament for her, which
haue committed fornication, and liued in
pleasure with her, when they shall see
that smoke of that her burning, 10 And
shall stand a farre off for feare of her
torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great citie
Babylon, that mightie citie: for in one
houre is thy iudgement come. 11 And
the marchants of the earth shall weepe
and wayle ouer her: for no man byeth
their ware any more. 12 The ware of
golde, and siluer, and of precious stone,
and of pearles, and of fine linnen, and of
purple, and of silke, and of skarlet, and
of all maner of Thyne wood, and of all
vessels of yuorie, and of all vessels of most
precious wood, and of brasse, and of yron,
and of marble, 13 And of cinamon, and
odours, and ointments, and frankincense,
and wine, and oyle, and fine floure, and
wheate, and beastes, and sheepe, and
horses, and charets, and seruants, and
soules of men. 14 (And the apples that
thy soule lusted after, are departed from
Revelation 19:1
thee, and all things which were fatte and
excellent, are departed from thee, and
thou shalt finde them no more) 15 The
marchants of these thinges which were
waxed riche, shall stand a farre off from
her, for feare of her torment, weeping
and wayling, 16 And saying, Alas, alas, that
great citie, that was clothed in fine linnen
and purple, and skarlet, and gilded with
gold, and precious stones, and pearles.
17 For in one houre so great riches are
come to desolation. And euery ship-
master, and all the people that occupie
shippes, and shipmen, and whosoeuer
traffike on the sea, shall stand a farre off,
18 And crie, when they see that smoke
of that her burning, saying, What citie
was like vnto this great citie? 19 And
they shall cast dust on their heads, and
crie, weeping, and wayling, and say, Alas,
alas, that great citie, wherein were made
rich all that had ships on the sea by her
costlinesse: for in one houre she is made
desolate. 20 O heauen, reioyce of her, and
ye holy Apostles and Prophets: for God
hath punished her to be reuenged on her
for your sakes. 21 Then a mightie Angell
tooke vp a stone like a great milstone,
and cast it into the sea, saying, With such
violence shall that great citie Babylon be
cast, and shalbe found no more. 22 And
the voyce of harpers, and musicians, and
of pipers, and trumpetters shalbe heard
no more in thee, and no craftesman, of
whatsoeuer craft he be, shall be found
any more in thee: and the sound of a
milstone shalbe heard no more in thee.
23 And the light of a candle shall shine
no more in thee: and the voyce of the
bridegrome and of the bride shalbe heard
no more in thee: for thy marchants were
the great men of the earth: and with thine
inchantments were deceiued all nations.
24 And in her was found the blood of the
Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that
were slaine vpon the earth.
19
1 And after these things I heard a great
voyce of a great multitude in heauen,
saying, Hallelu-iah, saluation, and glorie,
and honour, and power be to the LordRevelation 19:2
1091
our God. 2 For true and righteous are his
iudgements: for he hath condemned that
great whore, which did corrupt the earth
with her fornication, and hath auenged
the blood of his seruants shed by her
hand. 3 And againe they saide, Hallelu-
iah: and that her smoke rose vp for euer-
more. 4 And the foure and twentie Elders,
and the foure beastes fell downe, and
worshipped God that sate on the throne,
saying, Amen, Hallelu-iah. 5 Then a voyce
came out of the throne, saying, Prayse
our God, all ye his seruants, and ye that
feare him, both small and great. 6 And I
heard like a voyce of a great multitude,
and as the voyce of many waters, and as
the voyce of strong thundrings, saying,
Hallelu-iah: for the Lord that God that
almightie God hath reigned. 7 Let vs
be glad and reioyce, and giue glory to
him: for the marriage of that Lambe is
come, and his wife hath made her selfe
ready. 8 And to her was granted, that she
should be arayed with pure fine linnen
and shining, for the fine linnen is the
righteousnesse of Saintes. 9 Then he said
vnto me, Write, Blessed are they which
are called vnto the Lambes supper. And
he said vnto me, These wordes of God
are true. 10 And I fell before his feete,
to worship him: but he said vnto me,
See thou doe it not: I am thy fellowe
seruant, and one of thy brethren, which
haue the testimonie of Iesus. Worship
God: for the testimonie of Iesus is the
Spirit of prophecie. 11 And I sawe heauen
open, and behold, a white horse, and he
that sate vpon him, was called, Faithfull
and true, and he iudgeth and fighteth
righteously. 12 And his eyes were as a
flame of fire, and on his head were many
crownes: and he had a name written,
that no man knewe but himselfe. 13 And
he was clothed with a garment dipt in
blood, and his name is called THE WORD
OF GOD. 14 And the hostes which werein
heauen, followed him vpon white horses,
clothed with fine linnen white and pure.
15 And out of his mouth went out a sharpe
sworde, that with it he should smite the
heathen: for he shall rule them with a
Revelation 20:4
rod of yron: for he it is that treadeth
the wine presse of the fiercenesse and
wrath of almightie God. 16 And he hath
vpon his garment, and vpon his thigh a
name written, THE KINGS OF KINGS, AND
LORD OF LORDS. 17 And I sawe an Angel
stand in the sunne, who cryed with a
loude voyce, saying to all the foules that
did flie by the middes of heauen, Come,
and gather your selues together vnto the
supper of ye great God, 18 That ye may
eate the flesh of Kings, and the flesh of hie
Captaines, and the flesh of mightie men,
and the flesh of horses, and of them that
sit on them, and the flesh of all freemen,
and bondmen, and of small and great.
19 And I sawe the beast, and the Kings
of the earth, and their hostes gathered
together to make battell against him that
sate on the horse, and against his armie.
20 But ye beast was taken, and with him
that false prophet that wrought miracles
before him, whereby he deceiued them
that receiued ye beastes marke, and them
that worshipped his image. These both
were aliue cast into a lake of fire, burning
with brimstone. 21 And the remnant were
slayne with the sword of him that sitteth
vpon the horse, which commeth out of his
mouth, and all the foules were filled full
with their flesh.
20
1 And I saw an Angel come downe from
heauen, hauing the keye of the bottomles
pit, and a great chaine in his hand. 2 And
he tooke the dragon that olde serpent,
which is the deuill and Satan, and he
bounde him a thousand yeeres: 3 And
cast him into the bottomles pit, and he
shut him vp, and sealed the doore vpon
him, that he should deceiue the people
no more, till the thousand yeeres were
fulfilled: for after that he must be loosed
for a litle season. 4 And I sawe seates: and
they sate vpon them, and iudgement was
giuen vnto them, and I saw the soules of
them that were beheaded for the witnes
of Iesus, and for the word of God, and
which did not worship the beast, neither
his image, neither had taken his marke
vpon their foreheads, or on their handes:Revelation 20:5
1092
and they liued, and reigned with Christ
a thousand yeere. 5 But the rest of the
dead men shall not liue againe, vntill the
thousand yeres be finished: this is the
first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy is
hee, that hath part in the first resurrec-
tion: for on such the second death hath
no power: but they shalbe the Priests of
God and of Christ, and shall reigne with
him a thousand yeere. 7 And when the
thousand yeres are expired, Satan shalbe
loosed out of his prison, 8 And shall go out
to deceiue the people, which are in the
foure quarters of the earth: euen Gog and
Magog, to gather them together to battell,
whose number is, as the sand of the sea.
9 And they went vp into the plaine of the
earth, and they compassed the tents of the
Saints about, and the beloued citie: but
fire came downe from God out of heauen,
and deuoured them. 10 And the deuill that
deceiued them, was cast into a lake of fire
and brimstone, where that beast and that
false prophet are, and shall be tormented
euen day and night for euermore. 11 And
I saw a great white throne, and one that
sate on it, from whose face fled away both
the earth and heauen, and their place
was no more found. 12 And I saw the
dead, both great and small stand before
God: and the bookes were opened, and
another booke was opened, which is the
booke of life, and the dead were iudged
of those thinges, which were written in
the bookes, according to their woorkes.
13 And the sea gaue vp her dead, which
were in her, and death and hell deliuered
vp the dead, which were in them: and
they were iudged euery man according to
their woorkes. 14 And death and hell were
cast into the lake of fire: this is the second
death. 15 And whosoeuer was not found
written in the booke of life, was cast into
the lake of fire.
1 And
21
I sawe a newe heauen, and a
newe earth: for the first heauen, and the
first earth were passed away, and there
was no more sea. 2 And I Iohn sawe the
holie citie newe Hierusalem come downe
from God out of heauen, prepared as a
Revelation 21:16
bride trimmed for her husband. 3 And I
heard a great voice out of heauen, saying,
Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with
men, and he will dwell with them: and
they shalbe his people, and God himselfe
shalbe their God with them. 4 And God
shall wipe away all teares from their eyes:
and there shalbe no more death, neither
sorow, neither crying, neither shall there
be any more paine: for the first things
are passed. 5 And he that sate vpon the
throne, sayd, Behold, I make all things
newe: and he sayde vnto me, Write: for
these wordes are faithfull and true. 6 And
he said vnto me, It is done, I am Alpha and
Omega, the beginning and the ende. I wil
giue to him that is a thirst, of the well of
the water of life freely. 7 He that ouer-
commeth, shall inherit all things, and I
will be his God, and he shall be my sonne.
8 But the fearful and vnbeleeuing, and the
abominable and murtherers, and whore-
mogers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
all liars shall haue their part in the lake,
which burneth with fire and brimstone,
which is the second death. 9 And there
came vnto mee one of the seuen Angels,
which had the seuen vials full of the
seuen last plagues, and talked with mee,
saying, Come: I will shewe thee the bride,
the Lambes wife. 10 And he caried me
away in the spirit to a great: and an hie
mountaine, and he shewed me that great
citie, that holie Hierusalem, descending
out of heauen from God, 11 Hauing the
glorie of God: and her shining was like
vnto a stone most precious, as a Iasper
stone cleare as crystall, 12 And had a great
wall and hie, and had twelue gates, and at
the gates twelue Angels, and the names
written, which are the twelue tribes of
the children of Israel. 13 On the East part
there were three gates, and on the North-
side three gates, on the Southside three
gates, and on the Westside three gates.
14 And the wall of the citie had twelue
foundations, and in them the Names of
the Lambes twelue Apostles. 15 And hee
that talked with mee, had a golden reede,
to measure the citie withall, and the gates
thereof, and the wall thereof. 16 And the
citie laie foure square, and the lengthRevelation 21:17
1093
is as large as the bredth of it, and he
measured the citie with the reede, twelue
thousande furlongs: and the length, and
the bredth, and the height of it are equall.
17 And hee measured the wall thereof, an
hundreth fourtie and foure cubites, by the
measure of man, that is, of the Angell.
18 And ye building of the wall of it was of
Iasper: and the citie was pure golde, like
vnto cleare glasse. 19 And the foundations
of the wall of ye city were garnished
with all maner of precious stones: the
first foundation was Iasper: the second
of Saphire: the third of a Chalcedonie:
the fourth of an Emeraude: 20 The fift
of a Sardonix: the sixt of a Sardius: the
seueth of a Chrysolite: the eight of a
Beryl: the ninth of a Topaze: the tenth
of a Chrysoprasus: the eleuenth of a
Iacynth: the twelfth an Amethyst. 21 And
the twelue gates were twelue pearles, and
euery gate is of one pearle, and the streete
of the citie is pure golde, as shining glasse.
22 And I sawe no Temple therein: for the
Lord God almightie and the Lambe are
the Temple of it. 23 And this citie hath no
neede of the sunne, neither of the moone
to shine in it: for the glorie of God did
light it: and the Lambe is the light of it.
24 And the people which are saued, shall
walke in the light of it: and the Kings
of the earth shall bring their glorie and
honour vnto it. 25 And the gates of it
shall not be shut by day: for there shalbe
no night there. 26 And the glorie, and
honour of the Gentiles shall be brought
vnto it. 27 And there shall enter into it
none vncleane thing, neither whatsoeuer
woorketh abomination or lies: but they
which are written in ye Lambes booke of
life.
22
1 And hee shewed me a pure riuer of
water of life, cleare as crystall, proceeding
out of the throne of God, and of the
Lambe. 2 In the middes of the street of
it, and of either side of ye riuer, was the
tree of life, which bare twelue maner of
fruits, and gaue fruit euery moneth: and
the leaues of the tree serued to heale the
nations with. 3 And there shalbe no more
Revelation 22:18
curse, but ye throne of God and of the
Lambe shall be in it, and his seruants
shall serue him. 4 And they shall see
his face, and his Name shalbe in their
foreheads. 5 And there shalbe no night
there, and they neede no candle, neither
light of the sunne: for the Lord God
giueth them light, and they shall reigne
for euermore. 6 And he said vnto me,
These wordes are faithfull and true: and
the Lord God of the holy Prophets sent
his Angell to shewe vnto his seruants the
things which must shortly be fulfilled.
7 Beholde, I come shortly. Blessed is hee
that keepeth the woordes of the prophecie
of this booke. 8 And I am Iohn, which
sawe and heard these thinges: and when
I had heard and seene, I fell downe to
worship before the feete of the Angell
which shewed me these things. 9 But he
sayde vnto me, See thou doe it not: for
I am thy fellowe seruaunt, and of thy
brethren the Prophets, and of them which
keepe the woordes of this booke: worship
God. 10 And he said vnto me, Seale not
the wordes of the prophecie of this booke:
for the time is at hand. 11 He that is
vniust, let him be vniust stil and he which
is filthie, let him be filthie still: and hee
that is righteous, let him be righteous stil:
and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
12 And beholde, I come shortly, and my
reward is with mee, to giue euery man
according as his worke shall be. 13 I am
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
end, the first and the last. 14 Blessed are
they, that doe his commandements, that
their right may be in the tree of life, and
may enter in through the gates into the
Citie. 15 For without shall be dogs and
inchanters, and whoremongers, and mur-
therers, and idolaters, and whosoeuer
loueth or maketh lies. 16 I Iesus haue
sent mine Angell, to testifie vnto you these
things in the Churches: I am the root and
the generation of Dauid, and the bright
