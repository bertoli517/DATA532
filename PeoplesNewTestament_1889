1. The book of the generation. Literally ‘the book of birth,” or genealogy. This title applies,
not to the whole Gospel, but to the tables of descent in the first seventeen verses. The title was possibly
copied from some Hebrew document compiled from the genealogical tables. Jesus Christ. Jesus, the
personal name, which means ‘‘Savior;”’ Christ, the official title, which means “ Anointed.” He is our
Anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. The son of David.
The descendant. The prophets had declared
that the Messiah should be of David’s seed. The son of Abraham.
The Lord had promised Abraham
(Gen. 12: 8; 22:18) that in his seed all the world should be blessed. David and Abraham were the two
greatest ancestors of Jesus, and are named because it had been predicted that he would be their descendant.
2.
Abraham
begat Isaac.
Matthew begins with Abraham to trace the line down.
He was writing
for Jews, and Jewish history begins with Abraham. Luke (3: 23-88), writing for Gentiles, goes back to
Adam. For the differences between Matthew and Luke see verse 16,
8. Tamar.
Three women are named in this list, Tamar, Rahab and Ruth. These were all Gentile
women, and are named for this reason, and for their remarkable history. There were stains upon the
character of Tamar (Gen. 38: 11-80), and of Rahab (Josh. 2: 1), but Ruth is one of the sweetest women of
the Bible.
6.
David
;
the king.
The greatest of the line from Abraham
to Christ, so exalted
that one of the
titles of the Messiah was ‘“‘the Son of David.”
Of Uriah.
The mother of Solomon is referred to, not
by name, but as the wife of Uriah. Uriah was a Hittite, a Gentile, and his wife may have been also. She
was certainly a partner of David in the greatest guilt of his life.

17 So all the generations from Abraham to David
are fourteen generations; and from David until the
carrying away into Babylon are fourteen genera-
tions; and from the carrying away into Babylon un-
to Christ are fourteen generations.
18 { Now the birth? of Jesus Christ was on this
wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to
Joseph, before they came together, she was found
with child of the Holy Ghost.

16. Jacob begat Joseph.
The descendant of a long line of kings was a poor carpenter of Nazareth.
As the husband of Mary he was the legal father of Jesus, and Matthew gives his line of descent. A com-
parison of the table given by Luke will show that it differs in part from that of Matthew. Between Dayid
and Joseph the lists are widely different. Several views, all possible, have been presented, but the most
probable explanation is that Matthew gives the line of Joseph, the legal line, and that Luke gives the line
of Mary, the mother of our Lord. Asthe Jews regarded only male descent, unless Joseph, the supposed.
father, was a descendant of David
they would
not have recognized the genealogy
asa fulfillment of the
prophecies that Christ should be the Son of David; while Luke, himself a Gentile and writing for Gentiles,
was more particular to give the line that shows that Jesusis really the Son of David. If Mary was the
daughter of Heli, especially if an heiress, Joseph, by marriage, would become the ‘“‘son of Heli.” That,
thereis no contradiction between the two tablesis shown by the fact that the Jews who best understood
their genealogies never charged it. These tables were preserved with great care, for various reasons, until
Christ was born, but it is asserted that Herod destroyed them. If this is incorrect, they did not survive the
destruction of Jerusalem.
17. Arefourteen generations.
There are exactly fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and
two other series are made to correspond.
From David to, etc.
David's name is counted again to make
the number fourteen. The third series begins with Jeconiah and ends with Christ.

A Hebrew form for conjugal intercourse. The language of the verse does not

1. When Jesus was born. Though the homeof J oseph and Mary was at Nazareth, prophecy
had
declared that Christ should be born at Bethlehem, the native place of David; and this
was accomplished
by the agency of the Roman emperor. See notes on Luke 2 :1. The pride of the Jews in
their genealogies
would lead them to the head cities of their families; thus, Mary traversed with her husband
the length of
the land, from Nazareth to Bethlehem, the city of David, to whose house they both belonged.
In Bethle-
hem of Judea.
Bethlehem was one of the oldest places in the land of J udea, and had been in existence
at least 1,500 years before the Savior was born. It was the scene of the events so touchingly
related in the
Book of Ruth. It was known as the city of David, because it was his birthplace. The little
town has an
imposing aspect and commanding site. It stands on the summit of a narrow ridge, which projects
east-
ward from the central mountain chain of Judah. Itis about six miles south of Jerusalem,
on the road
toward Hebron. It contains at the present time about four thousand inhabitants, chiefly
Christians of
the Greek Church, who obtain much of their sustenance from the sale of relics to pilgrims
and visitors.
Inthe days.of Herod the king. This statement gives data for ascertaining the time of the birth
of
Jesus. Itis conceded that it took place in the last year of Herod’s reign. Butitis known that Herod
died
about three years before the first year of ourera. Therefore, if the Savior was born ‘tin the days of king
Herod,” he must have been born about four years earlier than the date assigned.
Herod was only partly
of Jewish blood, was a man of most bloody and unscrupulous character, a great tyrant, the murderer
of
even hisown wife and sons. Seven of the Herods are named in the New Testament.
(1) “Herod the
king,” here named, calle’ by Josephus Herod the Great, the first of the Herodian kings, a man of great
force of character, but a bloody tyrant.
(2)
Herod Archelaus,
He held his royal authority by the appointment of the Romans,
his son and successor in Judea (Matt. 2:22).
The Romans
deposed him and
appointed a Roman governor in his stead. (8) Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, who slew John
the
Baptist (Matt. 14:1). Alsoason of Herod the Great. (4) Herod Philip, a third son, the lawful husband
of Herodias (Matt. 14:3). (5) Another son, also named Herod Philip. He is only referred to in the
New
Testament in Luke 3:1. (6) Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, named in Acts
12: 1-3, 23.
(7) Herod Agrippa, the son of the last, the King Agrippa before whom Paul made his famous defense
(Acts 25: 13, 23; 26:27). There came wise men from the east. The word rendered “ wise men”
is
more correctly Magi, a term which designates an order of priests and philosophers
which
belonged orig-
inally to Persia and Media, and who were extensively distributed over the region of the Euphrates.
Those
described in the book of Daniel as wise men, astrologers and magicians, belonged to.this order. We can
only conjecture where these “‘ wise men” came from, but the probability is that they journeyed from the
valley of the Euphrates.

JewsP Their question shows two things, 1. That they
partook of the general expectation that about this time there would appear in the East a Ruler divinely
appointed to his mission. The works of profane writers of this period show that this expectation was
general. 2, Itis plain that the wise men misapprehended the mission of Christ, and expected him to be23.

because it showed them that their quest was not in vain.
11. And they came into the house. Not, probably, the stable where the Lord was born, but a
temporary home obtained after the crowd had left Jerusalem. Many suppose that Joseph and Mary
remained at Bethlehem until the forty days of purification were passed; that the young child was presented
in the temple as recorded in Luke 2: 22; that then they returned to Bethlehem; were visited shortly after
by the wise men, and thence fled into Egypt. If this is correct, the young child must have been six or
seven weeks old at the time of this visit. With Mary his mother. The child was probably in the

Egypt has a very intimate connection with Bible history. It was the nearest

convenient for a return at the proper time.

And hecame

Matthew makes no mention of the
previous residence at Nazareth, and he now names it first when it becomes the
home of Christ. It was an
obscure village, nestled on the hills about five hundred feet above the plain
of Esdrelon, on the side of
Galilee. It isnot named in the Old Testament, was probably a small town
in the time of Christ, but now
has about 6,000 inhabitants. That it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophets. Not
by
one prophet, but the summing up of a number of prophecies. No prophet
had declared in express
terms that he should be called a Nazarene.
They, however, did apply to Christ the term Nezer, from which
Nazareth is derived; the Nazarites, of whom Samson was one, were typical
of Christ; the meanness and
contempt in which Nazareth was held was itself a prophecy of one who
‘‘was despised and rejected.”
See Isa, 11:1; Jer. 23: 5; 83: 15; Zech. 3: 8; 6: 12.
1. Inthose days. Many years after the incidents of the last chapter; somewhere from twenty-five
to
thirty. Came John the Baptist. Called the Baptist or Buptizer because he baptized
the people. He
came forth asa preacher and reformer. He was the subject of prophecy (Isa.
40:3; Mal. 3: 1); his birth
was announced by an angel; he was of priestly family, the son of Zacharias and
Elizabeth, the cousin of
Mary. He was now about thirty years old. Preaching in the wilderness of
J.udea. A region thinly
inhabited, used mostly for pasture, a rocky tract in the eastern part of Judea
and west of the Jordan and
the Dead Sea.
2. Repent ye. The great rite of John was baptism, but the great duty commanded was
repentance.
Repentance is more than a sorrow for sin; itisa determination to abandon it
and live a new life. It
means a change of the will, or heart, new purposes, a determination to leave
off sinning. Sorrow is not.
repentance, but “godly sorrow worketh repentance” (2 Cor. 7:10).
The kingdom of heaven.
The
long expected kingdom ruled by the Méssiah King, predicted by the prophets, and
especially by Daniel
(Dan. 2: 44). The announcement of this anxiously-waited-for kingdom
thrilled all Judea. Is at hand.
It is to be noted, 1. That the kingdom to which he referred was in the future,
but near. It did not begin
with Abraham, or David, or even with John the Baptist. 2, It is the kingdom of
heaven, not an earthly
kingdom, and hence, must have a King sent from heaven. That King was
not yet revealed to the public,
but we have seen that one was born at Bethlehem who was to be the King. John
was not the founder, but
the herald of the coming King.(Ch. III.

Pointing, perhaps, to the stones of the Jordan. In thus sinking the higher claims of J udaism, John
points to the Gentiles, who were to become Abraham’s children by faith. (See Gal. 3: 29.)
10. The axe is laid at the root of the tree. A sign that the tree isto be cut down, The tree

‘less fruit, it is fit for nothing but to be burned.
11. Iindeed baptize you with water unto repentance.

removed on entering a house, and leftin charge of a servant, who brings them again when needed. So
humble was John, compared with the King, that he was hardly worthy to be his servant. He shall bap-
tize with the Holy Spirit. In order to know what is meant we must refer to the fulfillment. On the
day of Peniecost occurred such a baptism, the first so recognized in the New Testament. Then the spirits
of the apostles were overwhelmed by the Divine Spirit, so that they spoke as he gave them utterance.
It
was Christ who “shed forth” the baptism of that occasion. This would be plainer had the Greek
en, here
rendered “‘ with,” been rendered # in,” after the word baptize. Of the 2,660 occurrences of en in the Greek
New Testament it1s rendered ‘‘in” in the Common Version 2,045 times. The American Committee
of
Revisers in the Revised Version
(see margin) so render itin connection
with the word
baptize, and are
doubtless right. These great scholars, mostly learned Pedo-baptists, would Say, ‘““Baptize in
water,”
“Baptize tn the Holy Spirit.” And with fire. The term ire is used in verse 10, and there means a
destroying agency; it is used again in verse 12 in the same sense; it is used in verse 11, also, the intervening
verse, and must be used in exactly the same sense as in the other two verses. It cannot mean
a curse in
verses 10 and 12, and a blessing in verse 11, without a word of explanation. Itis strange, therefore, that
all
commentators should not agree that the baptism of fireisa baptism of trial and suffering. There were
two classes before John. Some would repent and be baptized finally in the Holy Spirit; there were others
who would remain impenitent, and be baptized in the awful trials that would come upon Israel. The
next verse explains this, John says in it that there is the wheat andthe chaff; one shall be gathered inte

The very words addressed to the Messiah in Psalm
2:7, and from which the Son of God
became one of his standing appellations,
Thus the baptism
of Christ
was the occasion of his public
recognition. No reader should fail to observe the
significance of the time chosen by God for the
acknowl-
edgment of the Son. Itis just after he has humbled
himself in an act of obedience, in baptism, that
the
Holy Spirit anoints him as the Christ, and God
formally acknowledges him as his Son. No
more forcible
expression of the estimate set by God on this institut
ion could be given. This example andthe New
Testa-
ment harmonize in teaching—1, That we must
be baptized if we would follow Christ, 2. That
itis when

Holy Spirit (Acts 2: 38). 8. That when we have

1. Then was Jesus led of the Spirit. Mark
says he was driven of the Spirit, a phrase that indi-
cates a sudden and forcible impulsion. Into
the wilderness.
Tradition has placed the scene of
Christ’s temptation in that part of the wilderne
ss of J udea which lies between Jerusalem and
the Dead
Sea, and particularly in the mountain called
Quarantania, from this forty days’ fast. To

for Christ to
make bread when he was hungry, for himself,
as he afterwards did for the five thousand.
Why not?
Becauseif he had availed himself of his Divine
power to escape the discomforts and suffering

he would have failed to suffer as we do, to
set us an example in all things, to be tempted

we are; and besides, he ‘‘came to minister,”

The three temptations had been met, three times the tempter had been baffled, three times the victory had
been won. The first assault had been made through the door of appetite, ‘‘ the lust of the flesh; the second
through vain glory, ‘‘the lust of the eyes;” the third through ambition, “the pride of life.” All had
appealed to Jesus to turn away from the pathway of self-denial and suffering marked out for him. All had
been met by the shield of faith, and the tempter beaten back by the sword of the Spirit.
11. Then the devilleaveth him. Luke adds, ‘‘fora season.” When the devil is resisted he always
flees. Angels came and ministered to him. When he fought off the tempter, after the victory was
won, angels came to minister to him. I suppose this ministry was to supply him with food, but they would
also afford spiritual sympathy.
12. Now when he heard that
John was delivered up. A long period lapses between the
temptation and the next event recorded. Matthew does not try to follow the order of events, and he now
passes over more than a year. This year had: been actively employed. The intervening events are, (1) the
return of Jesus from the wilderness to Bethabara, John 1: 15-37, where the first disciples are called; (2) the
return to Galilee and the miracle at Cana, John 2: 1-11; (8) the first passoyer of the Lord’s ministry in Jeru-
salem and the temple cleansed, John 2: 14-35; (4) interview with Nicodemus, John 8: 1-21; (5) ministry in
Judea, John 4:2; (6) leaves for Galilee, passes through Samaria, conversation at Sychar, John 4: 4-52;
(7) heals nobleman’s son, John 4: 46-54; (8) a period of retirement in Galilee, Jokn imprisoned, Matt. 4: 12;
(9) attends feast in Jerusalem, miracle at pool of Bethesda, John 5; (10) returns to Galilee, April
A. D. 28.
We thus see that an interval of more than a year elapsed between the temptation and the imprisonment
of
John, John was thrown into prison because he rebuked Herod (Matt. 14: 4; Mark 6: 17). Withdrew

Galilee. From prudence (John 4:1), Christ had been teaching in Judea (John 4: 2),

At thai

of Galilee, had a synagogue, a Roman garrison, and a customs station, with Matthew as the tax gatherer.
It has long since disappeared, It was called “ Christ’s own city”? because he made it an earthly
home. It
was on the border between the tribes of Zebulon and Naphtali.

23. Jesus went about all Galilee. In the next three verses are condensed the labors and teaching
of a long period, of which a detailed ‘account is given in the following chapters, Teaching in their
synagogues.
The synagogues, the Jewish houses of worship, where the Jews met every Sabbath, fur-
nished Jesus a congregation and a suitable place for teaching. Tt was customary to read the Old Testament
in course, and after the reading, a teacher, or rabbi, was usually called on to speak. This custom gave
Jesus, and his apostles after him, a fine opportunity to declare the New Covenant. Preaching the gospel
of the kingdom.
Gospel means “good news.” He announced the good news of the speedy advent of
the long expected kingdom of the Messiah. He did not, however, at this time proclaim himself to be the
Messiah. Healing every sickness.
He sympathized with all human affliction and healed the body in
order that he might heal the soul.

Some of those who listened were reviled by the Jews, and persecuted unto death. For my sake. In the

The two expressions mean the same.
12. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad. On account of persecution, The reason why they may
justly rejoice is given; Great is your reward in heaven. So perseouted they the prophets.

Salt preserves from corruption.
The disciples of Christ preserve
the world from general corruption. Whatever becomes utterly corrupted is doomed to be destroyed. But
if the salt have lostits savour.
Salt is worthlessif it has lostits qualities. It preserves no longer.
It is fit only to be cast out and trodden under foot, So, too, if those who are the salt of the earth cease to
communicate saving power, they are fit only to be cast out, and Christ will cast such out of his mouth (see
Rev. 8: 16).
14. Ye are the light of the world. The business of the church is not only to save, but to enlighten.
Christ is light, and his disciples must be light. A city seton a hill. Anciently cities, for the sake of
defense, were placed on hills, Such cities are seen from afar. So must the church give forth its light.
15. Light a candle and put it under a bushel. A lamp, in the Revision, which is correct.
Candles and candlesticks were not used in Scripture times. It would be foolishness to light a lamp and
put it under a bushel measure.

The divorce laws were very lax among the Jews.
Aman could put away his wife ‘‘ for any cause” (Matt. 19:8). Moses directed a legal letter of divorce-
ment (Deut. 24:1). Christ positively forbids divorce except for unchastity. Marriage is a divine institu-
tion, and the obligation is for life (Matt. 19: 3-9; Rom. 7: 1-3; 1 Cor. 7: 10-17).

model, the perfect ideal, and we will constantly ascend higher by striving to attain to it.
1. Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men tobeseen.
The Common Ver-
sion is wrong, and the Reyision right, in using the word “‘righteousness.”” The Savior condemns ostenta-
tious piety, and then he singles out three illustrations of his meaning. The Christian is not forbidden to
practice righteousness before men, but to make it his object to be seen.

This is the first example.
The Greek word rendered
hypocrite, means
The wrong way, that of the
a theatrical actor, one who is not
real, but actsa part. Their method was to give ostentatiously. In our age the world rings with the praises
of the millionaire who gives a few thousands, but is silent concerning the humble ones who have taken
from their necessities and given tothe same cause. Sound a trumpet before thee. This seems to be
a proverbial expression to denote the making of a thing publicly known.
The meaning is, when you give
to the poor, do not make a show of it. Hypocrite. A Grecian actor. The actors wore masks and

that there must be no publishing of our alms deeds. That thine alms may bein secret. It is not
concealment that is required, so much as to avoid ostentation. Openly. Literally, ‘‘in the open place,”

hypocrites, the men who make a public show of their devotions that they may
have the name of sanctity,
Love to pray standing in the synagogues.
These love, not to pray, but to pray where they will be
seen, and pray that they may be seen. So the Pharisees took pains to be in some
public place, where they
could strike an attitude of prayer in the sight of many observers. The same
spirit is often seen still.
6. When thou prayest, enter into thy closet. Private devotions are meant, nor
is this designed
to prohibit prayers in public assemblies. The Lord himself both prayed ‘in
the mountain alone,” in the
night alone, and in public in the presence of his disciples. We have
records of many prayers offered by
the apostlesin public assemblies. “Thy closet” may mean any secret
place. Peter’s closet was on the.
house-top; the Savior’s on a mountain alone.
;
7. Use not vain repetitions as the heathen do. What is forbidden is not
much praying, nor
praying in the same words (the Lord did both), but making the
number of prayers, length of prayers, or
time spent in praying, a point of observance and of merit. 1 Kings
18: 26 gives an example of the repeti-
tions of the heathen. Mahometans and Catholics still hold that there is merit
in repeating certain prayers
a set number of times.
8. For your Father knoweth.
Here is given abundant reason for short prayers. Many prayers
apparently aim to give God information on matters connected with this world.
9. After this manner pray ye. The Savior does not bid us use
these words, nor command any set
form,.but gives this asa proper example of prayer, simple, brief,
condensed, yet all-embracing. Our
Father which art inheaven.
These words reveal a very tender relationship between God and the
true worshiper, and base the petition on the fact that the child
speaks to the Father. Hallowed be thy
name.
Of the seven petitions of the Lord’s prayer the first three are in behalf
of the cause of God; the
glory of his name, the extension of his kingdom, and the prevalence
of his will, The other four, which
are properly placed last, as least important, pertain to our individual
needs. No one can offer the first
three petitions who isin disobedience.
Hallowed. Holy, sacred, reverenced.
10. Thy kingdom come. The Megsiah’s kingdom had not yet come,
but was proclaimed by the Lord
asathand. It did speedily come, but in its fulness, and in its
final triumph over evil, it has not yet come,
For this coming we may now pray, and the prayer is answered
in part by each success of the gospel. Thy

be done, asin heaven, soon

earth.
None can pray thus who have not merged their own wills
He, in effect, prays the prayer of Gethsemane,
‘Not my will, but thine,
be done,”
It is mockery for disobedient lips to utter such a prayer.
11. Give us this day our daily bread. We are bidden to ask
for our bread, not for future years,
but for ‘‘ this day.”
12. Forgive us our debts, as we forgive, etc. Debts mean moral
obligations unfulfilled—our
shortcomings, our sins. Let it be noted with emphasis that God is
asked to forgive us as we forgive others,
We ask, in other words, that he may mete outto us what we measure to others,Ch. VI.]

:
24. Nomancanservetwo masters.
He cannot give his heart to two services atthe same time.
He cannot follow two callings successfully. Ye cannot serve Godand mammon.
This is the direct
application. The Chaldee word ‘‘Mammon” means money or riches. It is here personified as an idol.
“Mammon” originally meant “trust,” or confidence, and riches is the trust of worldly men. If God be
not the object of supreme trust, something else wil! be, and it is most likely to be money.
25. Take no thought for yourlife.
At the time the Common Version was made, the expression,
“Take thought,” meant to be anxious.
The Revision properly renders it, ‘‘ Be not anxious.’””
word means, “to have the mind distracted.’’
Christ does not forbid prudent forethought.
The Greek
Is not the
life more than food? The argumentis:
God gave the life, and itis higher than food. If he gave it,
he will see that itis sustained, if you trust in him. So, too, he made the body. He will see that it is
clothed.
26. Behold the fowls of the air. God feeds the birds without their sowing or reaping, but they do
the work for which they were created, and God takes care of them. So, too, he will take care of us—not in
idleness or improvidence - but if we do the work for which God created us.
277.
Which
of you
can add one
cubit, etc.
There can hardly bea doubt that this ought to be
rendered, ‘‘add one cubit to his age,” or period of life. Theideais:
‘‘ What is the use of anxiety? Who,
by his anxiety, can add anything to life’s journey?” If it is proper to speak of ‘length of life,” it is also
appropriate to speak of adding a cubit to its length.
28. Consider the lilies. While the lilies do not toil or spin, they do their work, draw up sustenance
from the earth, and drink in the dew, rain and sunbeams,
So we are to do our appointed work. If we do
this, trusting in God, he will supply all our needs.
29.
Even Solomon in all his glory.
To the Jew the court of Solomon was the highest representa-
tion of human glory. The magnificence of the court is not only celebrated in Jewish writings, but in all
Oriental literature, and it is still proverbial throughout the East. Yet he was never arrayed with the taste
and beauty of one of these.
Itis probable that both birds and lilies were in sight from where the Lord
was sitting.

The swine were also unclean. They would have no use for
pearls, and perhaps
would rush upon those who seattered the pearls. So,

to try to save others, but we must use common

A leper came.
Compare Mark1: 40-45; Luke 5: 12-15,
Leprosy was a dreadful and hopeless
disease. It begins as a skin disease, defies medical skill, and isa kind of living death. Dr. Schaff says:
“Near the Jaffa gate of Jerusalem I saw, in 187%, these miserable creatures with withered limbs imploring
aid, and visited a hospital of incurable lepers.” There are various forms of the disease, but white leprosy
seemed most common among the Hebrews. With it the sufferer became white from head to foot. The
leper, by the law of Moses, was regarded unclean, was separated from the people, was regarded as dead,
and the disease was a type of sin. See Ley. 13: 1-12; 2 Kings5:27; Num.5:2. Lord. An expression of
faith, as well as the words that follow.

vent such a declaration on account of prejudice. Besides, the Lord often forbade noising abroad his cures,

6. Lord, my servantlieth at home sick of the palsy. Luke says his servant “was dear unto
him,” and the whole account of Matthew indicates intense solicitude. Paralysis, or palsy, was a common
disease in those days.
(See Matt. 4:24.)
Alford says, “‘ The disease of the text may have been tetanus, or
lockjaw, which the ancient physicians included under paralysis, Luke says that ‘* he was ready to die.”

Luke tells us that he started at once, but was interrupted by what follows,
8. The centurion answered.
Through friends whom he had sent for this purpose (Luke 7: 6).
I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof. This humility was partly due to his
consciousness that he wasa Gentile. Rigid Jews did not hold social intercourse with Gentiles, and the
centurion may have supposed that so holy a Jewish teacher as Jesus would hesitate to come under his
roof. Speak the word only.
‘Speak only a word,’ is the idea, and ‘“‘my servant will be healed.”
Not even Martha (John 11: 2) thought that
Jesus could have saved her brother Lazarus without going to
him.

10. When Jesus heard it he marvelled.
There are two cases in the Lord’s history where he is
said to have marvelled; here andin Mark 6:6. In one case he marvels at the faith of a Gentile; in the
other at the unbelief of the Jews. Ihave not found so great faith, no. notinIsrael.
The great-
ness of his faith is shown in his lofty conception of the power and dignity of Christ. This great faith was
found, not in Israel, but in a Gentile.
In one case beside, that of the Syro-pheenician woman (Matt. 15: 28),
also a Gentile, the Lord commends the greatness of faith.Ch. VIII.)

has to yield to the other it must be the lower one, 2, The view is also held that the disciple asked that he

Compare
this commission
with the one given to the apostles after the death and resurrectio
and
n of
the Lord (Matt. 28: 19). In this commission the apostles are forbidden to
go to the Gentiles or the Samari-
tans, and are confined to the house of Israel. In the other they
are commanded to go into “‘all the world,”
and to “preach the gospel to every creature;” to go “‘first
to Jerusalem, and to J udea, and to Samaria
and to the uttermost part of the earth.” The first commission is Jewish; the
second is world-wide. Yet
both are given by the same Lord; why this wide difference
? Because the new dispensation was not
ushered in until after the resurrection. The Jewish law,
national, exclusive, a wall of partition from Gen-
tiles, was yet in force. Christ, “‘born under the law,” and
the apostles also were under it until it
wastemoyed.
They could not keep it and yet become missionaries to the
Gentiles. But when Christ died
the old dispensation, the law, died with him. “The handwriting of ordinances was
nailed to the cross,”
The old covenant passed away when the new came into force,
sealed with the blood of Christ, After the
death and resurrection of Christ, the law ceased to be
binding upon the apostles. The distinctions of Jew
and Gentile were destroyed. Hence, under the new
covenant, the world-wide covenant, there was a new
commission that would send the gospel to all the world.
The old covenant was with the seed of Abraham;
the new covenant embraced
all nations.
See Heb. 8: 13.
7. Preach
The kingdom of heaven is at hand. John th e Baptist, and
Christ also, had
preached, ‘‘The kingdom is at hand.” It had not yet been inaugurated. So
the apostles were still to
preach. It was near, but not in existence. There was
no such charge in the second commission.
Then
“all power in heaven and on earth was in the hands of Christ.” He became
King after he suffered, and
his kingdom was inaugurated on earth on the day of Pentecost. When
he was “lifted up” (John 3: 15)
he became King,
8. Heal the sick, etc. Not only in order to doa beneficent
work, but to demonstrate that they had
the Lord’s commission.
9,10. Provide neither gold, etc. Because “the workman
is worthy of his meat,” and those to
whom they preached should supply all their wants. Compare
1 Tim. 5:18 and 1 Cor, 9: 7-14. This has
always been the law of Christ, Scrip. A wallet, or 'valise. Nor shoes. They
were allowed to wear
sandals (Mark), such as the common people wore. They should go with simply
their ordinary wear.
They were required to dress as the people. Nor staves. With

extrasupply. A staff was always carried in walking over the rugged
mountains of Palestine.
11. There abide. With some one noted for hospitality

Christ obeyed God, and carried out his work for the salvation of
men, though it required him
to die upon the cross in order to do it. And ever since, the cross
has stood as the emblem, not of suffering,
but of suffering for the sake of Christ and his gospel.
And follow me. To follow Christ is to take him
for our master, our teacher, our example; to believe his doctrines,
to uphold his cause, to obey his pre-
cepts, and to do it though it leads to heaven by the way of the cross.
89. He that findeth his life shalllose it. Whoever counts his life
of so much value that he will
preserve it by sacrificing his Christian integrity, or will renounce
his religion to save his life, will find in
the end that he has lost his soul forever for the sake of a few
fleeting years; while he who gives up all
things, even life itself, will find an abundant reward in the life
eternal. All self-seeking is self-losing. The

he was a disciple,” or out of regard for Christ, he should never
lose his reward. Good deeds are neyer
lost. Note the six things here spoken of as belonging to discipleship
of Christ: (1). Confessing,
or professing;
(2) Fighting; (3) Bearing his standard (the cross);
(4) Suffering; (5) Following;
(6) Giving up life. These are all the duties of the soldier.
2. When John had heard in prison. Compare Mark 6: 14-29 and
Luke 7: 19-28. John had now
been a year in prison, to which he had been sent by Herod Antipas, the tetrarch
of Galilee, because he had
rebuked his adulterous marriage with his brother Philip’s wife (Matt, 14:
1-11). Josephus says that
Macherus, a strong fortress built by Herod the Great, the father of Antipas,
about ten miles east of the
Dead Sea, was the prison. He sent his disciples. To make the inquiry found
in the next verse. The
course of Jesus was so different from what John himself, in common with other
Jews, expected of the
Messiah, that after lying in a dungeon for a year, he began to be uncertain. If
Jesus was the Christ, whyCh. XI.]

Perhaps John, impatient of the long delay, hoped to incite Jesus to proclaim his Messiahship.

4. Jesus answered and said. Luke states that at that same hour he cured many of their infirmities,
After permitting the messengers to see his work, he pointed to it as his answer. Go and shew John
again those things which ye do hear and see. To John’s question Jesus gives no direct reply.
There is something severe in the whole of our Lord’s demeanor and language, as if reproving this shaking
of John’s higher faith in God.
5. Dead areraised. In Luke, the raising of the widow’s son at Nain immediately precedes this mes-
gage; and in this Gospel we have seen the ruler’s daughter raised. The poor have the gospel
preached to them. It adds to the force of this testimony that the poor had always been overlooked by
Pharisees and the Jewish doctors. The ancient philosophers and theologians had no gospel for those who
could not pay forit. The climax is preaching the gospel to the poor. Jesus answers John by pointing to
his works. They were amore convincing answer than words. What he has done for mankind is stilla

Capernaum was destroyed by the Romans, and for many centuries has not had an existence. And
remained untilthis day. Note the inference: 1. Sodom was destroyed forits sins. 2. Had it not
been sinfulit would have ‘‘remained.”
8. Therefore it is sinsthat destroy citiesand nations. Jerusalem,
Babylon, Sodom, Capernaum, and other extinct ancient cities have perished on account of their sins.

O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.
Christ addresses God as his Father, not ashis Lord.
The
obedience he yields is that of a Son, not of a subject. Four more times,in deep emotion, Christ thus
addresses the Father (John 11: 41; 12: 28; 17:1; Luke 23: 34). That thou didst hide these things

27. All things have been delivered unto me of my Father. The Lord speaks, in part, in
anticipation.
It was the divine purpose, in sending the Son, to deliver ‘‘all things,” the gospel, salvation,

ingness of the Lord. The kings of earth and the great are usually difficult of access, while Jesus is not

29. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. He has first asked us to come, and made a
gracious promise. He next shows us how tocome. We are to come by taking his yoke upon us. Taking
on the yoke is a symbol of submission. The two steps by which we come, and secure the promise of ‘rest
unto our souls” are then, 1. Submission to Christ. 2. Becoming
his disciples.Ch: XII.)

The yoke that sin imposes is heavy, and bearing it brings no rest. So.
too, the yoke of false or corrupted religion is burdensome; but Christ’s yoke is easy. Itis not hard to bear
it because itis borne inlove. His burden, evenif it be the cross, is light, because he helps us to bearit.
Note: That one rejecting Christ in the midst of light is worse thana heathen.
Christ graciously invites

He is the rest of the soul.
1. Atthattime.
Compare Mark 2: 23-28 and Luke6:1. About the time when grain begins to ripen
in Judea, that is, not far from the first of May. Walked through the corn fields. Wheat or barley,
for which the general word, ‘‘corn,’? was used. When maize was discovered by the Europeans in America
they called it ‘‘ Indian corn,” because it was a food grain like wheat, rye and barley. We now apply to it
exclusively the designation of “‘corn.” The paths, the only roads, led and still lead through the grain
fields in Palestine. Beganto pluck. Permitted by Moses (Deut. 28: 25).

Butthe Pharisees saw it.
See note on Matt.3:7.
Some of the sect were in attendance on the
watch fora ground of accusation. Notlawfulonthe sabbath.
They did not object to taking the ears
of corn, but to gathering, rubbing out the grains of wheatin the hand, and eating them on the sabbath.
To understand their position, it must be noticed that after the Law had said that the Jews were ‘to do no
manner of work’?
onthe
Sabbath,
the ‘Tradition
of the Elders”
had laid down
thirty-nine principal
prohibitions, which were ascribed to the authority of the Great Synagogue, and which were called abhoth,
“fathers,” or chief rules.
From these were deduced a vast multitude
of toldoth, ‘descendants,’
or
derivative rules. Now, “reaping” and “threshing” on the Sabbath day were forbidden by the abhoth;
and by the ¢oldoth it was asserted that plucking corn-ears was @ kind of reaping, and rubbing them a kind
of threshing. The vitality of these artificial notions among the Jews is extraordinary. Abarbanel relates
that when, in 1492, the Jews were expelled from Spain, and were forbidden to enter the city of Fez lest
they should cause a famine, they lived on grass; yet even in this state ‘“‘religiously avoided the violation of
their Sabbath by plucking the grass with their hands.”
To avoid this they took the much more laborious
method of grovelling on their knees, and cropping it with their teeth. We give one more example of the
‘If on the Sabbath a Jew put out a lamp from fear of the
foolishness of their Sabbath requirements.

They ought to have Enown, for they professed to

toward
these hungering disciples was more acceptable to God than sacrifices at the altar; though
sacrifice was the
crown of all the Jewish rites. The quotation is from Hosea 6: 6, and is also quoted in Matt.
9:13. It
shows that all our forms, rites and ceremonies are worthless before God unless we have kind and merciful
hearts.

Because the Sabbath is made for humanity,
the Lord of humanity is Lord of the Sabbath, Observe, ts Lord of the Sabbath. He does
not, then,
abolish it, but has the right to make any change in it, in the interest of mankind, that
seems to him wise.
Neither Moses, nor any other mortal, ever claimed to be Lord of the Sabbath.: This is
a declaration of
‘Divinity.

way to it when the conversation took place. It was probably at Capernaum.

Luke 6: 6-11. And
they asked him. Luke says it was the scribes and Pharisees. Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day? In the opinion of the Pharisees, to kindle or extinguish a fire on the Sabbath was a great desecra-
tion of the day, nor was even sickness allowed to violate rabbinical rules. It was forbidden
to give an
emetic on the Sabbath, to set a broken bone, or put back a dislocated joint. Of course, they had added
alt
this to the law of Moses, That they might accuse him. Not in the conversation merely, but before
the local judges, the officers of the synagogue, or the council.Ch. XIT.]

out demons. Josephus tells of one named Eleazar, whom he says.did cast them out. Christ does not say
whether they did or not, but argues: ‘‘T£1, by Satan, cast out demons, by whom do your own exorcists,

1:17. The great fish was probably not a whale, the Greekis ‘‘sea monster,” but a white shark, which
abounds in the Mediterranean, and is said to swallow a horse whole. The miracle was the preservation of
the life of Jonah during his living burial, This was a type of the burial and resurrection of Christ. So
shall the Son of man be three days and three nights. Jesus says (Matt. 16:21) that he will “be
raised again the third day.” Hence, in Jewish usage the third day must mean the same as three days and
three nights. It was andis customary with the Orientals to make any part of the day stand for the whole
twenty-four
hours.

4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way-

5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had

Of which only samples are preserved, even
by Matthew, and still fewer in the other Gospels. Parables.
Narratives designed to convey spiritual
instruction. The parable differs from the proverb in being
a narrative, from the fable in being true to
nature, from the myth in being undeceptive, from the allegory
in that it veils the spiritual truth. Behold, a
sower went forth to sow.
It is the sowerin the original. There was grain land on every
side, and the
figure was familiar to every hearer, There are no farm houses in Palestine,
All live in towns or villages.
Hence, the farmers “‘ go forth” to sow.

out of the hills into the plain had a

of the field.
37 He answered and said unto them, He that
soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
38 The field is the world;* the good seed are the
children of the kingdom;” but the tares are the chil-
dren of the wicked one;
39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the
harvest is the end of the world;4 and the reapers
are the angels.¢
40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned
in the fire;* so shall it be in the end of this world.

and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things
that offend, and’ them which do iniquity,

him, saying,

The parable in verses 24-30 above.
By a compari-
son we may learn: 1. The kingdom is likened to a man sowing good seed in his field. 2. The Soweris
the Son of man, who sows by means of hiskingdom. 3. The good seed is the word of God as seen in its
fruits, Christ's followers. 4. The field is the world. It is Christ’s field, All power is given to him
in
heaven and in earth. His kingdom is rightfully the whole earth, but much of it is held still by the
enemy,
who has to be conquered. He will prevail finally, and the kingdoms of the earth shall become the kingdom
of the Lord and his Christ. 5. The wheat raised from the good seed is the “children of the kingdom,”
the disciples of Christ converted by his word. 6. The tares are not bad church members, but
bad men;
those who have been under the influence of the wicked one. %. The righteous and wicked are
to remain
in the earth together. The righteous are not to seek to exterminate the wicked. The evil and
the good

It had its elders, of whom the president was called the ‘‘ruler” of the syna-
go'ue. The ruler presided over the worship, and all the elders sat on raised seats. These were ‘the
chief seats” that the Pharisees liked to sit in. There was a set lesson from the Scriptures for each Sabbath,
for they were readin order. The reader was appointed by the ruler and might be any member.
On one
occasion we learn that Jesus was the reader. After the reading and prayers there was an opportunity for
any Jewish theological teacher to speak,
Of this opportunity Jesus, and later, Paul, often availed them-
selves. The service of the synagogue in our times is, in many respects, similar to that of the time of Christ.
The officers of the synagogue had the power of scourging, of suspending, or of excommunicating (casting
out) offenders.
1. Herod the tetrarch.
Compare Mark 6:14-29and Luke 9:7-9. Herod Antipas, one of the sons of
“Herod the King.’
See notes on Matt. 2:1, for information of the Herods,
Called the éetrarch, or ruler of
a fourth part, because he inherited one-fourth of the kingdom of his father. Heard of the fame of
Jesus. Absent much of the time from Galilee in campaigns against Aretas, king of Arabia, he probably
did not hear much until his return home.
2.
This is
John the Baptist.
Herod claimed to be a Sadducee, and hence held that there was no
life whatever after death, but under the terrors of a guilty conscience his creed undergoes a change.
Hence his first thought when he hears of the deeds of Jesus is that the murdered John has risen from the
dead. Therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. During his life John
wrought no miracles (John 10:41).
Herod supposed that his resurrection had clothed him with new
power. This opinion was shared by others (Matt. 16: 14; Mark 8: 28).
8. For Herod had laid hold on John. This arrest of John the Baptist had taken place a yearCh. XIV.)

Herodias’ sake. Antipas had been, while at Rome, the guest of his brother Herod Philip. Here he
became entangled by the snares of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; and he repaid the hospitality he
had received by carrying her off. He had himself long been married to the daughter of Aretas, king of
Arabia. This Herodias was the granddaughter of ‘Herod the King,” and, hence, the niece of both her
lawful husband and of Herod Antipas, who now had her.
4. It is not lawful for thee to have her. The marriage was unlawful for these three reasons:
(1) The former husband of Herodias (Philip) was still living. (2) The former wife of Antipas was still®
living. (8) Besides, the Jewish law did not permit a man to marry his niece.
5. He feared the multitude.
Mark says he feared John also. He no doubt feared John’s influence
with the multitude.
6. When Herod’s birthday was kept. In imitation of the Roman emperors, the Herodian
princes kept their birthdays with feasting and revelry and magnificent banquets. We learn from Mark
that he made a supper, or banquet feast. The daughter of Herodias.
Her name, according to
Josephus, was Salome, a daughter by Philip, Herod's brother. She was afterwards married to her uncle
Philip, the tetrarch of Iturea (Luke 3:1). Danced.
It was not customary for‘ladies of high rank to
dance beyond the limit of the harem. The Oriental dance was of a libertine character. But her wicked
mother induced her own daughter thus to degrade herself in order to accomplish her revengeful purpose.
7. He promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask. Herod confirms his
promise by an oath.

18. When Jesus heard of it. When he heard of the fate of John the Baptist and of Herod’s con-
jectures concerning himself. It wasa busy time. The twelve had just returned from a highly successful
ministry and his own popularity was at its greatest height. The crowds, anxious to see, converse with
him, or to be healed, pressed on him so as to give no leisure for reflection, or even to eat (Mark 6: 31). It
was but natural that he should wish a quiet season on receiving the tidings of the death of one related to
him like John, Into adesert place. Nota sandy, barren spot, but one uninhabited and lonely. They
crossed the Sea of Galilee (John 6: 1), and proceeded in the direction of Bethsaida-Julias, at its north-
eastern corner (Luke 9: 10), just above the entrance of the Jordan into it. To the south of it was the green
and narrow plain of Z/-Batihah, ‘‘with abundant grass, and abundant space for the multitude to have sat
down.” They followed him on foot out of the cities. The multitudes, seeing the course of the
boat that bore the Savior and the twelve from Capernaum, rushed along the shore in order to reach its
landing place in advance. The country west of the Sea of Galilee was, at that period, according to
Josephus, wonderfully populous. Capernaum alone had 30,000 inhabitants, and there were twelve other
cities upon or near its shores,
14. And Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude.
When he disembarked from the boat,
the multitude was waiting. That it was great is shown by the fact that the men numbered 5,000, apart
from the women and children. Was moved with compassion.
He seems, from John 6:3, to have
retired to the mountain for a short time, but then, filled with compassion, returned to the multitude.
This is the only miracle of which there is an account in each of the four gospels. The parallel accounts
are in Mark 6: 30-44; Luke 9: 10-17, and John 6: 1-14.

It was the ‘first evening” which

three o’clock in the afternoon. The second evening, according to Jewish customs, began at sunset. The
day had already been spent in teaching and healing. This is a desert place. And hence there would
be no hamlets dotting it, in which the multitudes could get provisions for themselves.
There are no farm
houses in Palestine. The whole population lives in towns or villages, and often the farmers go many
miles to their fields,

how this could be done, though they cheerfully obeyed.
17. Wehave here but five loaves and two fishes. It was Andrew (John 6: 8) who spoke. The
loaves here were of barley meal made into small, thin cakes, baked hard on the side of the oven, so as to be

Following tradition, you say one thing while God says in the law just the opposite. The

uses. Thus by an artifice the law with respect to parents could be set aside. The Talmud furnishes a
curious illustration of this perversion of the command.
The Mishna says: ‘ He that curses his father or
his mother is not guilty, unless he curses them with an express mention of the name of Jehovah.”
6. Ye have made void the word of God by your tradition. Modern Pharisaism does the
same. Church tradition leads to dogmas that set aside God’s commands. The corruption of the sim-

This rebuke to the Pharisees, who had added to
the law of Moses many traditional, human precepts, applies equally to all modern religionists who have
modified or added to the Christianity of Christ and the apostles. Whatever one cannot findin the New
Testament is of such a character; observance of saints’ days, of Christmas, of Lent, the removal of the cup
in the Lord’s Supper from the laity, infant sprinkling, party creeds and party shibboleths, are all of men
and not of God. The devout worshiper should go right to the New Testament for his religion, and reject
every ordinance or precept that is not to be found there.

Hecalled the multitude.
In order to show them that these Pharisaical expounders of the
law did not understand its real sense. Not that which goeth into aman defileth. The Mosaic law
forbade Jews to eat what was ceremonially unclean, in order to teach the need of moral purity. The
Rabbins added stringent precepts to prevent the slightest contact with ceremonial uncleanness, but were
careless about moral purity. Christ shows that a pure heart is far more important than clean food, in the
ceremonial sense, in the stomach,

ministry of Christ were exhibited by Gentiles, that of the centurion (Matt. 8° 8,9). and

The fact that the latter addresses Jesus as ‘‘the son of David,” shows that she knew of the prophecies
concerning the Christ and that he would be the son of David.

not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
The Lord’s personal mission
was to the Jews. Under the first commission his apostles were directed to go only
to Jews (Matt. 10: 6).
It would be impossible to evangelize the Gentiles without setting aside the Jewish customs,
the law of
Moses, and arousing the bitterest prejudice of the Jews. Hence it was the divine plan that the Son
should
“keep the law blameless” during his earthly ministry. It was only when the Jews crucified him that
“the
handwriting of ordinances was nailed to the cross,” the ‘wall of partition”? between Jews and Gentiles
broken down, and all prepared for the Great Commission which bade his disciples ‘“‘go into all the world
and preach the gospel to every creature.”
25. Then came she and worshipped him. Instead of being discouraged by the words of Christ,
she only became the more earnest.
26. Itis not meet to take the children’s bread.
She knew that, in comparing the Jews to the
children of God’s family, and the heathen to the dogs without, he simply used the customary language
of
aJew. He would bring out fully the greatness of her faith. The gospel was offered first to the Jews
and
then to all,
27. Truth, Lord. Observe that she acquiesces heartily in Christ’s declaration: itis not fit that the
dogs be fed before the children. Yet the dogs eat of the crumbs.
The word for crumbs is a diminu-
tive, and means little crumbs.
28. Woman, great is thy faith. We can see how greatness of faith is manifested:
(1) She came
to Christ under difficulties. (2) She persevered when her prayer seemed to be denied.
(3) She still
pleaded when obstacles were presented.
(4) She waited at the feet of the Lord until he had mercy. Such
faith always prevails. Her daughter was made whole.
Mark, who adds some features omitted by
Matthew, follows the woman home, where she found her daughter no longer raving, or in convulsions,
but lying quiet on the bed, healed in consequence of her mother’s faith and prayers.

that Peter is the rock upon which Christ founded his church. The Catholic position
is based upon the fact
‘that Peter means a stone (see John 1: 42), and the Savior’s language might
be rendered, ‘‘Thou art a stone,
and upon this rock I will build my church.”
The Catholic yiew is untenable, for, 1. The Savior does not
say, ‘‘Thou art a stone, and upon thee I will build,” ete., or, ‘“‘Thou
art a rock, and upon this rock I will
build.” He changes the word in the Greek from Petros (Peter, a stone)
to Petra, a rock, or ledge of rock—
a solid bed-rock. 2. Every saint is a stone (see 1 Peter 2: 5). The
Lord declares that Peter is one of these
living stones, made such by his confession of faith, and ready to be
built into the church, the spiritual
temple, formed of living stones, and built upon the rock. So is every
confessor of Christ. In order to
settle what the Savior does mean by the rock, we must consider the 18th
and i9th verses together, and keep
in mind the entire figure. This figure portrays (1) a Builder, Christ;
(2) a temple to be built, composed of
lively stones, the church; (3) a foundation for that temple, the rock;
(4) the gates of an unfriendly city or
power which shall seek its destruction, hell, or more correctly, Hades,
the unseen abode of the dead, the
grave; (5) a door-keeper of the church, or spiritual temple, with his
keys, Peter. Peter's place in the figure
is not that of the foundation, but that of the key-holder, or turnkey.
The only difficulty is in settling what
the Lord means by the rock. Since this rock is the foundation of
the church, the central principle, the
fundamental idea, we are aided to a correct decision by the teachings
of the Word elsewhere, We learn
from 1 Cor. 3: 11, ‘‘ That other foundation can no man lay than
that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” This
excludes Peter or any human platform. Christ is often called
a stone, ‘‘the stone that the builders
rejected,” “the chief corner stone,” “the stone that is the head
of the corner,” “the spiritual rock which
is Christ.”
Faith in Christ held in the heart and
spiritual life and of the church.
confessed
with the lips is the very foundation
of the
This constituted the fundamenta) difference in apostolic days between
Christians and unbelievers, the church and the world. It does still.
Itis the essence of the teaching of
the New Testament that the platform or foundation of the Christian
society, the church, is the belief that
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. It is then Peter’s
grand confession, faith in the Spiritual
Rock, the faith that lays hold of Christ, belief that he is the
Anointed of God, the Divine Savior, that the
Lord pronounces the rock upon which he will found his church,
That this view is correct is shown by a
correct understanding of the declaration, The gates of hades
shall not prevail against it. From
the gates of a city always marched forth its armies, The powers
of hades are represented by its gates.
Hades is not hell (Gehenna), but the unseen abode of the dead
that holds the departed within its gates,
Just after these words the Lord talks of his death, or entering hades,
Six months later the Sanhedrim sent
him to death for making the same confession Peter had just
made. See Matt. 26: 64-67. They expected to
demonstrate that the confession of his divinity which he had
made was false by sending him to hades,
which they supposed would hold him and prevail against the
confession, the Rock, He was sent there
from the cross, but the gates of hades did not prevail, for they
could not hold him, and the living Savior,
rising triumphant from the tomb, was the unanswerable argument
that his own and Peter’s confession
was a rock that could never be moved. His resurrection demonstrated
that he is the Rock. Hades did not
prevail.
19. Iwill give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of

office
of the keys is to open the doors, or close them, On Pentecost,
Peter first opened the doors and
declared the conditions on which men could have their
sins forgiven, be bound or loosed, and thus enter
into the church. Seven years later at Caesarea he declared
the Same conditions to the Gentilés. While
Peter took the lead the keys were given to all the apostles, and
to no other mortal.

He could not bear the thought of the crucifixion, and still
expected Christ to become a worldly king.
23. Getthee behind me, Satan. Christ saw in the words of Peter a suggestion not so much of his
as of Satan’s. It wasa temptation to shrink from the work for which he came. It was the same tempta-
tion that called out from him the same rebuke once before (Matt. 4: 10).
24. If any man will come after me. Compare Mark 8: 34-38, and Luke 9: 23-27, The conditions
of discipleship are presented. Let him deny himself. Let him be prepared to say “no” to many of
the strongest cravings of his nature, in the direction more particularly of earthly ease, comfort, dignity,
and glory. Take up his cross. Luke adds, daily; not once, butallthe time. The cross is the pain of
the self-denial required in the preceding words. The cross is the symbol of doing our duty, even at the
cost of the most painful death. Aud follow me. To follow Christ is to take him for our master, our

may have been suggested by the snow of Hermon, It was a vision of supernatural splendor,
8. There appeared unto them Moses and Elias.
(1) Among all the prophets and saints of the
Old Testament these were the two, of whom one had not died (2 Kings 2: 11), and the other had no sooner
tasted of death than his body was withdrawn from under the dominion of death and of him that had the
power of death (Deut. 34:6; Jude 9). Both, therefore, came from hades, but from hades conquered.
(2) Again, these two were the acknowledged heads and representatives, the one of the law, the
other of the prophets (compare Matt. 7: 12). And they were talking with Jesus. The subject of
their conversation is given in Luke 9:81. It was of the decease (exodus, departure, referring to his death
and ascension) which he should accomplish at Jerusalem, In this brief interview between the greatest
worthies of the old dispensation and the Founder of. the new dispensation their conversation would be
confined to the most important theme of earth and heaven. That was the Savior’s death,
4. Peter answered. The words were spoken as they departed (Luke 9: 38). Lord, itis good for
us to be here. Itis too brief a converse, too transient a glimpse and foretaste of the heavenly glory. He
would fain detain these august visitors. Let us make three tabernacles. Three booths of boughs,
like those of the Feast of Tabernacles. It seemed to him that the hour for the long-looked-for reign had
come.
5. A bright cloud overshadowed them. Christ, Moses and Elijah are represented as in the cloud,
which separated them from the disciples’ sight; and out of this cloud the voice spake to the disciples.

the disciples such a luminous cloud would be instantly accepted as a symbol of Divine presence. A bright
cloud, the Shekinah, is throughout the Old Testament dispensation employed as a symbol of God’s pres-
ence, being very generally entitled ‘the glory,” or ‘‘the glory of the Lord.” This is my beloved Son.
The same voice which had once before been heard at the baptism. Such aconfirmation of the great con-
fession of Peter was never to be forgotten.
Almost a generation later, when he wrote his second epistle,
the remembrance of this night was as vivid as ever. ‘‘For he received from God the Father honor and
glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory.” Hear ye him. The Divine voice
that spoke at Sinai and the baptism is heard, declaring Christ’s superiority to Moses and to Elias, in that
he is ‘‘ the beloved Son,” and commanding all to HEAR Him. Henceforth, not Moses, or Elias, are the law-
givers of the people of God, but Christ. The saints are bidden to turn from every human teacher, even
those as revered as Moses and Elias, to listen to our Lord. To hear Him will lead from error and sin into

a striking object lesson. This method was a prominent feature of Oriental teaching. Thus it was
that Christ washed the disciples’ feet (John 13) and Agabus bound his hands and feet with Paul’s girdle
(Acts 21:11).
3. Except ye be converted.
The Revision translates, ‘‘Except ye turn,” which is correct. The
Greek word translated in the Common Version ‘tbe converted,” is found inthe New Testament in the
active voice in every instance but one, and means
¢o turn,
It means something that the subject is to do,
not something that is to be done for him. Become as little children. Humble, teachable and free
from selfish ambition, like little children. Shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Instead
of discussing who should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven, they had better inquire whether they were
going to get in at all.
4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child. This explains the great
feature in which they must become as the child. Greatness in the kingdom is not secured by seeking to
be greatest. There is a lesson here for Christians, and especially preachers who are ambitious of distine-
tion.
5.
Whoso
shall receive one such little child in myname.
Receiving in my name is serving
with Christian love, and as belonging to Christ. Receiveth me.
Observe that the true way to receive
Christ is to receive into our hearts, for Christ’s sake, those who need our sympathies.
6.
Whoso
shall offend one of these little ones which
believe in me.
The Revision makes
this plainer by rendering it ‘‘cause to stumble,” or to go astray. The term “little ones” not only
embraces children who have learned to believe in Christ, but all lowly and humble disciples. Better for
him that a millstone were hanged about his neck. Better that a man should lose his life in so
terrible a way than to destroy the souls of others. Drowned in the depth of the sea. Which was
within sight, This method of capital punishment was practiced by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,
and possibly occasionally by the Jews. It is still practiced by the Turks.

that forgiveness must be extended to one who confessed his fault, but this was limited to three repetitions

That is, there should be no limit at which it shall be refused if it

condition that God forgives us ours, and he does not forgive the impenitent. Our mercy must be just as
unlimited as that of God.

17. Why callest thou me goodP none good but one, God. The Revision, following the
Siniatic, Vatican, and some other manuscripts, leaves’ off ‘‘good” before Master in verse 16, and changes
this to, ‘‘Why askest thou me concerning good?” Still, Mark and Luke give the question in the form of
the Common Version here; hence we are justified in adhering to the text as above.
Some have seen in
these words of Christ an affirmation that he was not divine. To these, Stier replies: ‘* Hither there is
none good but God, Christ is good, therefore Christ is God; or, there is none good but God, Christ is not
God, thererore Christ is not good.’ There is no answer to these syllogisms but to deny the sinlessness of
Christ. If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
The Lord had evidently asked his
first question to prepare the way for this direction. He has, in saying that no man is absolutely good, said
that no man can keep the commandments perfectly.

The inspired preaching of the apos-

They thus “bind” and ‘ loose,” or
“judge.” In judgment, salvation will turn on whether the Jews,
or the true Israel (Gal. 8:29), have
obeyed the ‘apostles’ doctrine.” The apostles even now judge the church.

Christ shall receive a hundred

be taken care of in this world, and
have earthly peace and joy, such as no sinner can have, and above

him
as the Son of David, the Messiah; (8) asked for mercy; (4) kept on crying when they tried to stop
him;
(5) when permitted, sprang up and hurried to Jesus; (6) asked of him to receive his sight. This is faith
in action.
1. When they drew nigh unto Jerusalem. Jesus passed through Jericho, where he bestowed
sight on Bartimaeus and salvation on Zaccheus, came up the mountain pass from Jericho to Jerusalem,
stopping over the Sabbath in the congenial home of Martha, Mary and Lazarus, in Bethany, and on
Sunday morning made his entry into Jerusalem. Compare Mark 11: 1-11; Luke 19: 29-44, and John
12: 12-19. As they drew nigh to Jerusalem they ascended the Mount of Olives. There were three paths
over the Mount of Olives: (1) on the north, in the hollow between the two erests of the hill; (2) over the
summit; and (3) on the south, between the Mount of Olives and the Hill of Offence—still the most fre-
quented and the best. Along this Jesus advanced.
To Bethphage.
Bethphage and Bethany were

east.

recorded. He went into the temple, not as a worshiper, but as its Lord. Cast out all them. This
casting of the traders out of the temple is not to be confounded with that recorded in John 2: 13-17, at the
commencement of Christ’s ministry. See notesthere. Them that sold and boughtin the temple.

Strangers, therefore, had to change their Roman, Greek, or Eastern money, at the stalls of the money-

workin the Lord’s vineyard. The publicans and sinners had refused, but repented at the preaching of
John. The others professed to obey, but did not. The design of the parable is to show that the publicans.

Let us seize on his inheritance.
If Christ prevailed, Judaism must fall;
if they could destroy Christ they could maintain their hold on the vineyard; or, in other words, seize the

whoseem to have been so carried away by the vivid description that they answered without seeing that
they pronounced their own sentence (see verse 41).
41. They say unto him,
and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen.
Their answer is not only their own decree of judgment upon themselves, but an unconcious prediction.
The nation was nearly destroyed in the Roman war; 1,100,000 perished in the siege of Jerusalem; the
Jewish polity was destroyed, and “another people,” the Church of Christ, mostly Gentile aliens before,
received the inheritance and the kingdom.
' 42. The stone which the builders rejected. ‘The Scripture” that speaks of this stone is Psalm
118: 22, 23—a psalm which the Jews applied to the Messiah. Peter twice applied it to him (Acts 4: 11;
1 Peter 2:7). The figure represents a stone rejected by the builders as worthless, and then found to be the
chief corner-stone of the building, The stone is Christ, rejected by the Jewish nation, but “the chief
corner-stone,”’ for thisis what is meant by the ‘head of the corner.’ The ‘‘corner-stone” joined two
walls. Alford thinks this is a reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in the church. Marvellous.
That the rejected stone should become the ‘chief corner-stone, elect and precious,’ on which the whole
structure of the spiritual temple rests.
43. Given to a nation bringing forth the fruits. The kingdom was taken from the Jews and
given to the ‘‘chosen nation” (1 Peter 2: 9); not any particular nation, but those chosen out of the nations

1. Jesus spake to the multitudes and to his disciples. This discourse, delivered in the courts
of the temple on the Tuesday before the Lord was crucified, has never been surpassed in indignant rebuke,
withering denunciation, and tearful sorrow over the coming fate of sinners who would not be saved. It
contains Christ's last words to the Jewish nation. The contest had been growing fiercer, the opposition of
his enemies was more bitter, their plots against his life were working, their utter perverseness was fully
manifested, the time for tender appeal had passed by, and the Lord turns upon the “ whited sepulchers,”
the ‘generation of vipers,” the hypocritical pretenders, ina philippiec that we believe has never been
equalled.

in the midst of it, like a rift of blue sky in the fearful storm-cloud, his love and pity
shine forth with wonderful beauty in the pathetic exclamation of verse 37. Only a part of the discourse is
found in Mark 12: 38-40; some similar sayings occur in Luke 11: 39-52, and a reference to it occurs in Luke
20: 45-47.

27. For ye are like unto whited sepulchres. It is stated that on the 15th of the month of Adair,
before the Passover, the Jews whitewashed all the spots where graves were situated. This was done both
to beautify them and to mark the spots as to prevent any one from passing over them, which would occa-
sion Levitical defilement. For this practice, Num. 19: 16 and Ezek. 39: 15 were cited. This custom gave
the basis for the Savior’s figure. In plain view of the Savior and his hearers, as they stood in the temple
court, could be seen the whitened tombs along the western slope of Olivet, some of which are still seen at
this day.
Beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s

They demonstrated by their hostility to Christ, by their plots and false charges, and would soon show by
their murder of the Lord, that they had just the same spirit as their fathers who slew Isaiah, persecuted
Jeremiah, and shed the blood of Zacharias between the altar and the temple. They were therefore their
spiritual children as well as their descendants. It adds to the vividness of this denunciation that from the
temple area where they were standing the crest of Olivet rose distinctly at the distance of half a mile, and
upon it were clearly visible the white sepulchers of the prophets which they had rebuilded, among them
the tomb of Zacharias, who is named just below as slain between ‘‘the temple and the altar.”

In Luke 11: 49, is a passage much
like this. The men sent were inspired apostles and evangelists. By giving the Jews still further opportu-
nities after the sin of the cross, the guilt of those who continued to reject the crucified Lord was agera- .
vated. Prophets. Inspired teachers, like the apostles, Philip, Stephen, ete. Wise men. Faithful,
devout and learned, but uninspired preachers. Scribes. Usually, those who copy and teach the wisdom

Zacharias. The reference is probably to 2 Chron. 24: 20. He was slain in the court of the house of the
Lord by the people, and died exclaiming, ‘‘The Lord look upon this and require it.” He was the son of
Jehoiada, The Siniatic manuscript omits Barachias in this place, and the error is supposed to have crept
in from the mistake of some early copyist who confused this Zacharias with Zechariah the prophet, who
was the son of Barachias.
86. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
As the
Amorites were spared until ‘their iniquity was full” (Gen. 15: 16), so the iniquity of Israel was allowed to
accumulate from age to age, till in that generation it came to the full, and the collected vengeance of
justice broke at once upon it. So it is often in the destruction of a nation. The French revolution of 1793
is another example,

this utterance comes out first in the redoubling of the word Jerusalem;
The intense feeling that spoke in
next in the picture of the sins of
the city which he draws—a city so wicked that it was not content with rejecting the messengers of God, but
even slewthem.
Iknow of nothing more touching than this apostrophe. How often would I have
gathered thy children together. Not only had the city been warned again and again by the prophets,
but the Lord had visited it at least six or seven times, and had for months taught in its streets. Nor did his
solicitude end with the cross. His long suffering, patience and love are shown by his charge in the com-
mission to the apostles: ‘To preach repentance and remission in his name among all nations, beginning
at Jerusalem.” Ye would not. ‘Would not” explains the cause of the rejection of the gospel. It is
not because God in Christ isnot ready; he would gather them. It is not because men cannot come. but
because they will not come.
Christ wished the salvation of Jerusalem; his will was for them to be saved;Ch.

he sought to influence their wills to make a choice of salvation, but they would not. So God still “is not
willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Peter 2: 9), but there are many
“who will:not come to Christ that they might have life” (John 5: 40). While God wills the salvation of
men, he does not destroy free agency by coercing the human will, but says: ‘Whosoever will, let him
come.”’
88. Behold, your house‘is left unto you desolate. This was the consequence of refusing to
come to Christ. The temple is the house meant. God will abandon it and leave it desolate. He will no
longer accept its worship.
89. Yeshall not see me henceforth.
This seems to imply that the temple shall be deserted when
he leaves it. With his departure the presence of God departs. He was the Lord of the temple. Till ye
shall say. These were his last words in the temple precincts, but they do not shut out all hope. Even
yet when the Jews shall join in the hosannahs of those who, on the Sunday before, had sung his praises,
and cry, ‘“‘Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,” they may be permitted to behold their
Messiah. Many have seen in this passage a promise of the final conversion of Israel. Zech. 12: 10, Rom.
11: 26, 2 Cor. 3: 15, seem to favor the same view. When Christ abandoned the temple in Jerusalem, it was
only fit for the destroyer. If we should drive him out of his spiritual temple, the church, it would be left
as dead as the body without the spirit.
1. And Jesus went out of the temple. Immediately after the discourse in which he pronounced
the woes upon the scribes and Pharisees, upon the temple and Jerusalem, This remarkable chapter is not
one upon which commentators are agreed, and the conclusions that I have reached on the points of differ-
ence will not be found identical with those of any other writer. I believe, however, that they will be
found harmonious with the Scripture. Compare Mark 13: 1-387; Luke 21: 3-36. His disciples
. . .
shew him the buildings of the temple. He had just foreshadowed its destruction. With this in
mind they point out its splendor, especially the amazing stones used in its construction. Compare Mark
and Luke.
The temple had been rebuilt in great splendor by Herod, and was not fully completed until
about thirty years after the Savior’s crucifixion.
2. Not one stone upon another, etc. Other great temples are in ruins, but their ruins indicate
their former splendor. The Parthenon, the Acropolis, the temples of Karnak, Luxor, and Baalbec are
examples; but to find even the foundations of the Jewish temple it is necessary to dig beneath the
modern city. It has entirely disappeared from the face of the earth, and a Mahometan mosque stands on
the spot where it stood.

the sunset. Tell us. The disciples, still thinking of what the Lord had said, ask three questions: (1) When
shall these things be? Thatis, the overthrow of the temple. (2) What shall be the sign of the coming?
And (3) of the end of the world? They supposed these events would be simultaneous—a mistake, To
understand what follows we must keep in mind that he has three questions to answer, nor are the answers
blended.
4,5. Take heed that no man deceive you. By pretending to be Christ. As they yet believed
that Christ would surely return to reign at Jerusalem, this admonition was needed.
Come in my name.
As the Messiah, We learn from Josephus that enthusiasts did come about the time of the end of Jeru-
salem, claiming to be sent of God.
Bar-cocheba, ‘‘the son of the star,’’ appeared in A. D, 120.
From time
to time other deceivers have appeared.
6,7. Yeshallhear of wars.
The Jewish war began in A. D. 66, and ended about five years after,
During this period all the Roman empire was filled with commotion,
Nero, the emperor, was overthrown
by Galba; six months after, Galba was overthrown by Otho; a few months after, Otho was overthrown by
Vitellius; alittle later, he was overthrown by Vespasian. All of these but the last, who ascended the
throne shortly before Jerusalem was destroyed, died violent deaths. Famines.
The natural result of
civil wars. Tacitus, the Roman historian, says of this period: ‘It was full of calamities, horrible with
battles, rent with seditions, savage in peace itself.”
8,9. Shalldeliver you up to tribulation. To persecution. Soon literally fulfilled in the Jewish
persecutions.
The

persecution of Nero also soon
followed.

Tacitus,
describing Nero’s persecution begun in A. D. 64, says ‘the Christians were haters of mankind.”
10. Then shall many be offended.
Shall stumble and fall, rather than suffer for Christ. The
half-hearted always do.
11. Many false prophets. False teachers. Compare Gal. 1:7; 1 John 2: 12, 18; 4:1; 2 Peter 2: 1;

15-20. When ye see the abomination of desolation.
This is the sign when Christians should
flee from Jerusalem. See Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11. Luke says, “When ye shall see Jerusalem encom-
passed with armies” (21:20). This was, therefore, Christ’s explanation of the abomination of desolation.
The Roman army, heathen, with heathen images and standards, ready to sacrifice to idols on the temple
altar, working the desolation of Jerusalem and the temple, is what is meant. In the holy place. Mark
says, ‘‘Where it ought not;” around
‘the holy city.”
See Matt.4:5.

enclosed Jerusalem in A. D. 67, then deterred by its strength, retired to Cesarea. This was the signal for
which the church waited, and it then fled beyond the Jordan.
21. Great tribulation.
The account given by Josephus, the Jewish historian who witnessed and
recorded the war, is almost an echo of the predictions of Christ. Women ate their own children from
starvation; the Jews within the city fought each other as well as the Roman army; on August 10, A. D. 70,
the city was stormed and there was a universal massacre; 1,100,000 persons perished, and 100,000 survivors

human race. For the elect’s sake. On their account, because there is salt to save the earth, an end
shall be put to the awful work of death. The elect are the believers in Christ (Rom. 11: 5-7).
23-26. Then. During this period of tribulation, give no heed to false prophets, false Christs, or to
those who say Christ is here or there.132

24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false

8. Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out. The Revision says, more correctly, ‘‘Our

Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open tous.

says, ‘‘ They came looking for mercy when it was time for judgment.” Luke 18:25 also teaches that the

an illustration of this solemn admonition.
AppLicATIon.—The Bridegroom is the Son of man; the time of the marriage is the coming to judgment;
‘ the tarrying represents the long and unknown period between his ascension and his return; the virgins
represent the waiting church; the wise virgins represent those church members who are always ready and
whose lights are shining; the oilin their vessels is the means by which their light is supplied; the foolish
virgins are church members who have become cold and lifeless; the midnight cry is the summons of death,
or the trump of judgment; the ery for oil is death-bed repentance, or an attempt at preparation in the face
of judgment; the shut door is a declaration that such repentance is too late to be of avail; the great lesson
is to be always in a state of readiness,

Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one.
The talent was not
acoin, but a weight, and was especially applied to the weighing of the precious metals, The Hebrew
talent is variously estimated to be equivalent to a weight of silver ranging from $1,500 to $2,250. To every
man according to his several ability. The sums entrusted to the servants were graded by their
capacity. The trust of the Lord to each servant is measured according to his mental ability, wealth, posi-

24 Then he which had received the one talent
came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an
hard man,* reaping where thou hast not sown,” and
gathering where thou hast not strawed:
25 And I was afraid,° and went and hid thy
talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that zs thine.
26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou
wicked! and slothful servant, thou knewest that I
reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have
not strawed;
27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my
money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I
should have received mine own with usury.
28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give
zé unto him which hath ten talents.
29 For unto® every one that hath shall be given,
thy lord.

acknowledged and rewarded in exactly the same terms as in the case of the first servant.
The final reward
depends on faithfulness, not greatness.
24. Iknew thee that thou artahard man.
The charge against the lord isinsulting. The term
hard, and the charge in the next clause, ‘‘of reaping where thou hast not sown,” affirm that the lord was
harsh, unfeeling, grasping, and unscrupulous about his methods of acquisition. It states the position of
many of our fellow-men. Many refuse to employ their talents in Christ’s service because they think ita
hard, exacting service, making unreasonable demands of self-denial, self-control and self-sacrifice.
23.
Thou wicked
and slothful servant.
The wickedness of the servant is demonstrated, not
only by his unfaithfulness, but by his false and slanderous excuses. .
27.
Thou oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers.
To the bankers.
If the lord
was so exacting as he supposed, he ought at least to have put his money to use with the money brokers
thatit might have earned something. Usury. Interest. The Jews were forbidden to take it from their
brethren, but were allowed to take it from aliens.
28.
Take therefore the talent from him.
He had shown himself unworthy of the trust.
He had
enjoyed opportunity to serve the lord, but had utterly neglected it; therefore the opportunity was taken
away. The application is easy. Give it to him which hath ten. Because he has shown himself
worthy of great trusts.
29. To every one that hath shall be given. Every attainment of honor, wealth, knowledge, or
spiritual grace helps to render further attainment more easy and more assured; while it is spiritually as
well as materially true that ‘‘the destruction of the poor is their poverty” (Prov. 10:15). Shall be taken
away even that which he hath. For every hath there is a richer hath; and in every hath not a deeper,
poorer hath not.
30. Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness. A state of banishment from the
presence of the Lord. Have you a trust from the Lord? Are you useful to him according to your ability?

The righteous understood well that they had often, in the name and from the love of
Christ, ministered to his brethren, the poor and suffering saints, but they had never understood
that their
Lord accepted this as a personal service to himself, It should be distinctly noted, (1) that the saved
are
the righteous, or those whose sins have been washed away by Christ; (2) they are those
who have lived
and acted in the name of Christ, or have been obedient to his will; (8) they have been full
of the love of
Christ and have faithfully ministered to the distressed, especially to those of the household
of faith, The
love of Christ implies love of the bréthren, and of all mankind.

8. They had indignation.
John shows that it was Judas who voiced the indignation. Why this.

often think what is spent
for the Savior is wasted.
9. This ointment might have been sold for much. Mark and John say, ‘three

pretence. Judas wanted to get the money into his bag. .
10. Why trouble yethe woman?
By your murmurs, as if she had done a sinful thing. She has
wrought a good work. What is done for Christ from love of Christ is always a good work.
11. Ye have the poor always. Always opportunities to do good to them, but
what was done for
Christ in the flesh must be done at once.
12. To prepare me for burial. It was customary to anoint the dead and lay the body
in spices.
See John 19: 40; Luke 23: 56; 2 Chron. 18: 14, Mary was probably impelled only
by her love of the Lord
and desire to do him honor; but Jesus, about to die and be buried, declares
the anointing a fit preparation.
13. Wheresoever this gospel. The gospel of a crucified Savior. In allthe
world. A prophecy
that its preaching will be world-wide. A memorial of her. Mary’s loving deed
has never been for-
gotten, but is to-day told in every quarter of the earth.

Then
- Judas Iscariot went. A comparison of all the accounts will show that when
his avarice was thus disappointed, he went, at the first. opportunity, to the priests.
His Master was about
to be crucified, he had not been permitted to enrich himself, there was now
no probability that he would
become the treasurer of Christ as an earthly king,
15. What are ye willing to give meP He had deliberately decided. He probably
knew of their
wish to seize Jesus secretly, and that they would pay for a guide that would lead them where he
rested at
night. Thirty pieces of silver. The price was agreed upon and paid. The pieces were silver
shekels,
temple money. The whole would contain about the amount of silver in twenty dollars,
perhaps equal in
value to $120 now. It was a fulfillment of Zech. 11: 12, Joseph was sold for twenty
pieces of silver
(Gen. 37: 28).
16. From that time. The time of the bargain with the priests. No one can tell certainly what day
the bargain was completed.Ch. XXVI.]

26. As they were eating. Before they had arisen from the paschal feast. Jesus took bread.
That is, one of the unleayened cakes that had been placed before him as the celebrant or proclaimer of the
feast. And blessed. As wasthe custom. Luke and Paul say, ‘‘gave thanks,” which is the same
thing,
This is my body. Not literally, asthe Catholics and Luther contend, but ‘represents my body.” We
interpret it as we do his other sayings: ‘The seed is the word,” ‘*The field is the world,” ‘‘The reapers
are the angels,” “‘The harvest is the end of the world,” ‘I am the door,” ‘I am the vine.” So, too, at
this very feast, the Jew was wont to say of the paschal lamb, ‘‘This és the body of the lamb which our
fathers ate in Egypt.” Not the same, but this is meant to represent and commemorate that. He could not
have meant that the bread was his real body, because his body was present at the tabie breaking the loaf, ~
and he was speaking and acting in person among them. The doctrine of the “Real Presence” is every
way unreasonable.
27. He then took the cup, and gave thanks. The cup was provided for the celebration of the
paschal feast, and was at hand as wellas the bread. Drink ye all of it. Observe that he simply said of
the bread, “Take, eat; but of the wine, “Drink ye all,” asif he intended to uproot the Catholic innova-

matter of special revelation to Paul (1 Cor. 11:23), seem to make it clear that Christ intended the ordinance
for a perpetual one, and that his apostles so understood it. '
30. When they had sung a hymn.
It was customary to conclude the passover by singiug the
Psalms from 115th to 118th. To the mount of Olives. To the garden of Gethsemane, which was on
the slope of that mount.
This journey over the Kedron to Gethsemane was made in the darkness of the
night. The Lord’s Supper, a memorial of his death, has a still more tender interest, from the fact that it
was established only two or three hours before he was betrayed and seized.

possible to save men, and carry out the divine work of redeeming them. Let this cup pass from me.
This cup is the betrayal, the trial, the mocking, the scourging, the cross, and all besides which our thoughts
cannot reach. But as thou wilt. This is an example of perfect faith—the faith by which alone
answers to prayer can be obtained. He that insists on his will, when it is contrary to the will of God, fails
in faith.

peril and bidden to watch. Luke says they were sleeping from sorrow. Great sorrow stupefies. Dr. Rush

account of the bloody sweat (Luke 22: 44). His agony returned on him. The continuance of the trial he
accepts as God’s answer to the petition, ‘‘Let this cup pass from me.” He now asks only, “Thy will be
done.”
43. He came and found them asleep again. The motive of this return we may reverently
believe to have been, as before, the craving for human sympathy in that hour of awful agony. Our
Savior, we must not forget, was human as well as divine.
44. He prayed the third time, saying the same words.
The fact is suggestive as indicating
that there is a repetition in prayer which indicates not formalism, but intensity of feeling.
45. Sleep on now, and take your rest. Ilook upon these words as reproachful. The hour when
he needed their watchfulness and sympathy was past. They had failed to guard in the hour when he
wished to be alone with God. Now the moment is at hand; the soldiers are approaching.

Was Curist’s Prayer ANSwERED?—The Epistle to the Hebrews (5:7) says it was. An angel came and
strengthened him (Luke 22: 43). There are two ways of answering a prayer for the removal of a burden.
In one, the burden is taken’ away, and we remain the same; in the other, we are made so strong that the
purden is no longer a burden to us; as what would crush a child, is but sport to a man.Ch. XXVI.]

Annas, the former high priest, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, probably while the Sanhedrim was assem-
bling in the darkness of the night (John 18:18). For the trial of Christ, compare Mark 14: 53-64; Luke
22: 54-71; John 18: 18-18. Scribes and elders were gathered.
Mark says the “chief priests” also.
Tt was a gathering of the Sanhedrim.
Those who were favorable to Jesus, like Joseph and Nicodemus,
were probably not called.
58. Peter followed
unto the court of the high priest. The enclosed area, open to the
sky, around which the palace was constructed, was called the court. The building extended all around
this.

false witness.
No one could be con-
demned legally without at least two witnesses who agreed (Deut. 17: 6; 19: 15), ‘*One witness,” it was
said, ‘‘was no witness.”
As there was no true testimony to a charge that could be punished with death,
they sought false witness. They found it not. That is, witnesses who would testify to a capital offence
and agree in their testimony. Afterward came two. These two gave a perverted version of what
Christ had said concerning his death and the resurrection of his own body under the figure of a temple.
See John 2:19. But even their testimony disagreed (Mark 14: 59).
62,68. Answerest thou nothing? Under these false charges Jesus maintained an impressive
silence. ‘As a sheep before his shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.” I adjure thee, etc.
This was the formula for an oath.
The High Priest, contrary to the principle of law which forbids that a
prisoner shall be compelled to criminate himself, called on Jesus to be a witness against himself.
To
answer yes, or no, to such a question, was to answer under oath,

silence to affirm his divinity under oath. It insured his death at their hands, for he was immediately con-
demned for the declaration. ‘‘At the very crisis of his history, when denial would have saved his life, he
asserts his claim to the Divine Sonship and to a Godlike power.”
65.
Then the high priest rent his garments.
A sign of mourning or indignation (Acts 14: 14).
It was a form that was always used when about to pronounce a judgment. He hath spoken blas-
phemy.
He did, if not Divine; he did not,if Divine. Hither he spoke the truth, or the wicked Caiaphas
spoke the truth and Jesus was false. If he spoke falsehood, the purest lips that ever formed human
words spoke falsehood on the eve of death, when he knew that the falsehood would send him to death.
Such an affirmation, from such a prisoner, at such an hour, can only be reconciled with a consciousness
of divinity.
66. He is worthy of death.
This is the formal decision of the Sanhedrim to condemn the Lord to
death for blasphemy. This was the second trial, the first examination being informal before Annas, and
is mentioned only by John. There was a third, named only by Luke, atthe dawn of day, because a
decision by the Sanhedrim
in the night was illegal.
See Luke 22:66.
This meeting only confirmed the
decision reached in the night before three o’clock. Itis also referred to in Matt. 27: 1.
67. Then did they spit in his face. The maltreatment recorded occurred between this meeting
and the one ealled to meet at daybreak. Spitting was considered among the Jews as an expression of the
greatest contempt (Deut. 25:9; Num. 12:14). Even to spit before another was regarded as an offence, and
treated as such by heathen also. Buffeted him. Struck him with their fists.
' 68. Prophesy untous,
. . . Whois hethatsmote thee? We learn from Mark that his face
was covered, as a mark that he wasa condemned man. The age was a cruel one, and Jewish bigots could
not be too rough to the condemned prisoner.
69. Now Peter sat without in the palace. While the preliminary examinations were being held
before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrim, Peter and John entered the court of the palace. This court was an
open square, enclosed by the palace which was built in a quadrangle all around it. From it doors and
windows opened into the rooms built around it, so that Peter was ‘‘ without the palace,”’ yet in the interior
court, where he could see and hear through the open door the proceedings in the hall. Oriental houses
are still built with this interior court. Anda damsel came to him, saying. John speaks of her as
the damsel who kept the door of the porch, or passage into the court. We are not told why she suspected
him. He was at this time in the interior court, and is said by Luke to have been standing ‘“‘among them”
“by the fire that had been kindled in the court-yard on account of the chilliness of the night.
70.
But he denied

Denied that he ‘“‘was with Jesus of Galilee.”

John says that the third charge was made by a kinsman

who asserted that he saw Peter in the garden. Mark says that they accused him of havinga Galilean

tricts had their dialects, as in England, or the United States.
74. He began to curse and to swear. Peter's third denial. He not only, with an oath, repeats
what he had said in the second, but he affirms it with imprecations of divine wrath on himself if he spake
not the truth. The gradations of guilt in the denials of Peter: (1) Ambiguous evasion; (2) distinct denial
with a false oath; (3) awful abjuration with solemn imprecations on himself. Immediately the

crows about midnight, or not long after; and
again always about the third hour after midnight, or three
o’clock. This shows that the second trial of Jesus took place before the dawn.
75. Peter remembered the word of Jesus. It was at this point that the Lord turned and looked

broke his heart. As the cock crew, his own confident assertions and the word of the Lord, “Before the
cock crow twice (before the second cock crowing) thou shalt thrice deny me,” rushed upon him. He
rushed out into the darkness of the night to weep.
Judas sinned, betrayed and sold the Lord from covet-
ousness. Afterward he was sorry, but it was the sorrow of this world that worketh death. It was remorse,
not repentance, and he went and hanged himself. Peter’s repentance was attested (1) by the bitterness of
his tears; (2) by his humble submission to his Lord’s subsequent rebuke (John 21: 15-17) ; (8) by his subse_
quent courage in confessing Christ in the face of threatening danger (Acts 4: 8-12, 19).

vided their own tombs. Peter, in Acts 1: 18, says that Judas fell down headlong and his bowels gushed

the rope gave way, and that he fell headlong upon the rocks below, a distance of forty to sixty feet.

58. Asked for the body of Jesus. Usually, the Romans suffered the crucified to remain unburied,
but Joseph, to prevent this, or any abuse of the sacred body, begged it of Pilate. The latter
consented
readily, probably anxious for respect for the body of him whom he vainly sought to save
from death.
59. Joseph took the body. Carefully down from the cross. Wrapped it in a clean linen
cloth. A winding sheet. Another Sanhedrist, Nicodemus, aided him (John 19: 39), and they enclosed
spices in the winding sheet.
60. Laid it in his own new tomb. A rock-hewn sepulcher, cut horizontally into the cliff.

goeth before you into Galilee. They are cited to Galilee to meet the Lord, not that his only appear-
ance would be there, for that was the seventh, but because, in that country, where
the largest number of
his disciples lived, he proposed to reyeal himself to the whole body of saints,
There he was seen “by
above five hundred brethren at once.”
9. Jesus met them, saying, Allhail! This was the second appearance of the Risen Savior. The
appearances were: 1. To Mary Magdalene alone (Mark 16: 9; John 20: 11-18), near Jerusalem—Sund
ay,
April9.
2. To the women
returning from the sepulcher (Matt. 28:9, 10).
8. To Simon Peter alone (Luke
24: 84). 4. To the two disciples going to Emmaus (Luke 24: 13), ete. 5. To the apostles at Jerusalem,
excepting Thomas, who was absent (John 20:19). These are all the same day. 6. To the apostles
at Jeru-
salem a second time, when Thomas was present (John 20: 26, 29)—Sunday, one week later. 7. At
the Sea of
Tiberias, when seven disciples were fishing (John 21:1). 8. To the eleven disciples on a mountain in
Galilee (Matt. 28:16). 9. To above five hundred brethren at once (1 Cor. 15: 6), in Galilee, near the time of
the last.
Itis possible that these two are-identical.
10. To James only (1 Cor. 15:7).
11, To all the apos-
tles on Mt. Olivet at his ascension (Luke 24: 51)—Thursday, May 18. 12. We may add to these that he was
seen by Saul of Tarsus (Acts 9: 3), and by John on Patmos (Rey. 1: 13).
10. Benotafraid.
They had met the Lord while hastening to tell the story of his resurrection. It is
when we are in the path of duty that we will enjoy his presence and his blessing. Go tell my brethren.
This is the first time he had called the disciples his brethren.
11. Behold, some of the watch came into the city. The time when these men went into the
city isnoted. It was while the women were on their way to tell the disciples. It is also stated that “ some
of the watch” only went to the priests. How numerous the watch was we are notinformed.
As the watch
had been set by the priests themselves (Matt. 27: 65, 66), it made its report to them instead of to Pilate.

When
they were assembled with the elders.
The chief priests and the elders, probably a
secret meeting of the leading members of the Sanhedrim.
They had gone too far into crime to stop.
13. His disciples came by night, etc. The improbability of this story is easily seen: 1. The
soldiers would not dare to go to sleep on guard. It was death. 2. If they had gone to sleep they could
testify nothing of what was done while asleep, Their testimony of what occurred then would be worth-
less. 3. The disciples did not expect a resurrection and would hardly.believe it when it occurred. 4. They
had shown themselves cowards and would not have dared to try to take his body away. 5. Had they dared,
had the Roman soldiers slept, they could not have remoyed the stone and earried off the body without
detection.

15. This saying is commonly reported . .
until this day. It was still current among
the Jews when Justin Martyr wrote in the seccnd century, at least a hundred years after Matthew penned
these words.
16. The eleven disciples went away into Galilee. The time when they went to Galilee is not
stated, though we learn from John 20: 26 that they remained in Judea for over a week after the resurrec-
tion. Of the appearances in Galilee we have three accounts: the brief one here, which describes the
official meeting of the Lord with the entire body of disciples; the one by the sea, described in John 21, and
the reference by Paulin 1 Cor. 15:6. The eleven went into Galilee because the Lord had commanded
them to do so. Into a mountain where Jesus had appointed. The Revision says, ‘‘the mountain,”
which is correct.
The Lord had named the mountain where he should meet them, and had probably also
appointed the time. The object of the appointment was probably to secure a general meeting of his
disciples.
17. When they saw him they worshipped him. Itis also stated of the women (verse 9) that
they worshiped him, or kneeled at his feet. Some doubted.
This does not, as I suppose, refer to the
eleven. The doubts of all, including tie skeptical Thomas, had been silenced before this. But the story
that he had risen seemed so incredible, that there were those assembled on this occasion who had been
doubters.
These, ‘‘ when they saw him,” remained doubters no longer, but ‘‘ worshiped him.”
18.
Spake unto them.
To the whole assembly of five hundred brethren (1 Cor. 15: 6). A commis-
sion had been given long before to the twelve apostles (Matt. 10: 1-15), and also to the seventy, but it
differed widely from the one now given. It confined the preaching to the Jews, and announced the king-
dom of heaven as yet in the future. Now the preachers of Christ are sent, by the authority of the King, to
make disciples of all nations.
The old dispensation had ended with the cross.
The new one had begun
with the resurrection. All authority. Henceforth he was the King and Judge of the nations. The
word ‘is given” denotes the source from whence he obtained his power, and implies that it was not
inherentin the Son. Phil. 2: 9indicates that it was given to him after, and in consequence of, his yolun-
tary humiliation; and 1 Cor. 15: 27, shows
that it is held in subjection to the Father.

nations. Christ came to be the Savior of the world, Hisisa universal religion. In the Great Commission
he looks beyond Judea, and commands that the Gospel shall be offered to all nations. The test of
eighteen centuries shows that Christianity is not local or national, but is adapted to the needs of all man-
kind. 4. It isnext stated how disciples shall be made. Baptizing them.
The rite by which those who
believe upon him should be formally enlisted and enrolled in the school of Christis baptism. Itis nota
baptism of the Spirit that he means, because it is one that those whom he addresses are commanded to
administer. He alone baptized with the Spirit; his apostles and disciples baptized in water, and it is to
this rite that he refers. Hence, when we turn to the preaching of the apostles under this commission, we
find that all converts were at once baptized (Acts 2: 88-41; 8: 12-18).- 5. The end or result of baptism is also
given. Converts were to be baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. It
is a positive affirmation of the Old Testament that where the name of the Lord is recorded there will he
meet his disciples, or there will be his presence. See Exod. 20:24. The Lord declares that the three
names, that of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, are recorded in baptism. In
this rite,
then, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit meet the believer; the Father to receive him as a child, the Son to wel-
come him as a brother, and to cover him with the mantle of his own purity; the Holy Spirit to endow him
with that Spirit by which he can say, “‘Abba, Father.” ‘Into the name of” is equivalent to “into the
presence of,” or ‘‘into the Father, and into the Son, and into the Holy Spirit.”
20. Teaching them. The second part of the commission is next given. The first part commands
the making of disciples, and tells how they must be made. The second part provides for the instruction
of the disciples in righteousness. This is to be done by ‘‘teaching them.” To observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you. What must be taught by the faithful Christian teacher is
prescribed. It will at once be seen that this cuts off much that is often taught. Weare not to teach
‘untaught questions,”’ ‘‘ oppositions of science, falsely so called,” dogmatic speculations, isms or human
ereeds. Christ has never commanded these. On the other hand, we are to teach all things he has com-
manded. Some of these things we have recorded in the Gospels; others we have in the Acts and in the
Epistles. They embrace the various duties of Christian life. I am with you alway. It was an
arduous work he had commanded his disciples to undertake; a few uninfluential and unlettered laboring
men to undertake the moral and religious conquest of a world that had just crucified their Master. There
was, howeyer, an assurance that they should be equal to the task, for, (1) All power, or authority, in
heaven and earth was in the hands of their crucified Lord. (2) He now declares, 7 am with you always.
He who has all power will be present with them, a help in time of need. Heis a mighty, present and
helping Savior. Even unto the emd of the world.

TO
MARK.
The Second Gospel was written by Mark, the kinsman of Barnabas, and the
com-
panion of Paul in his first missionary journey. When and where it was written is un-
certain. Of its author the following facts are gathered from the New Testament: He
is first named in Acts 12:12. His mother’s name was Mary, and we learn from Col.
4:10, that she was a sister of Barnabas. She dwelt in Jerusalem, and this city was
probably Mark’s early home. He was converted by Peter (1 Peter 5: 13), it has been
supposed, at the great ingathering on the day of Pentecost. He became a minister
(Acts 12: 25), attended Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey, did not
prove satisfactory to Paul (Acts 15 : 88), and as Barnabas insisted on taking him, he
and Paul parted company on the second missionary journey. That Paul and Mark
were afterwards intimate is shown by the subsequent history. We find him by Paul’s
side during his first imprisonment at Rome, A. D. 61-63; and he is acknowledged by
him as one of his few fellow-laborers who had been a ‘‘comfort” to him during the
weary hours of his imprisonment (Col. 4: 10, 11; Philemon 24). Wenext have traces of °
him in 1 Peter 5:13.
‘The church that isin Babylon . . . . saluteth you, and so
doth Marcus, my son.” From this we infer that he joined his spiritual father, the
friend of his mother, at Babylon, then and for some hundred years afterwards one of
the chief seats of Jewish culture.
From Babylon he would seem to have returned to
Asia Minor; for during his second imprisonment, A. D. 68, Paul, writing to Timothy,
charges him to bring Mark with him to Rome, on the ground that he was “profitable
unto him for the ministry” (2 Tim. 4:11). From this point we gain no further informa-
tion from the New Testament respecting the Evangelist. It is most probable, how-
ever, that he did join the Apostle at Rome, whither also Peter would seem to have
proceeded, and suffered martyrdom along with Paul. After the death of these two
great pillars of the Church, ecclesiastical tradition affirms that Mark visited Egypt,

founded the Church of Alexandria, and died by martyrdom.
ever, very uncertain. Mark was not one of the twelve, and there is no reason to
believe that he was an eye and ear witness of the events which he has recorded; but an
almost unanimous testimony of the early fathers indicates Peter as the source of his:
information.
The most important of these testimonies is that of Papias, who says,
‘‘He, the presbyter (John) said: Mark, being the interpreter of Peter, wrote exactly
whatever he remembered; but he did not write in order the things which were spoken
or done by Christ.
For he was neither a hearer nor a follower of the Lord, but, as I
said, afterward followed Peter, who made his discourses to suit what was required,
without the view of giving a connected digest of the discourses of our Lord. Mark,
therefore,
made
no mistakes when

circumstances
as he recollected
them; for he was very careful of one thing, to omit nothing of what he heard, and to
say nothing false in what he related.”
is confirmed by other witnesses.
Thus Papias writes of Mark.
This testimony
Tradition affirms that Mark wrote for the benefit: of
Gentile Christians, and this view is confirmed by the fact that he often explains
Jewish customs, where Matthew,
writing for Jews, omits the explanation
as if well
understood. In the comments on Mark references will be found to the parallel pas-
sages in Matthew, where full explanatory notes will be found.

The whole incident
illustrates: (1) The Divine power of Christ. He could assert that he forgave sins
without blasphemy.
(2) The difference between Christ and his apostles, none of whom claimed to forgive
sins (see Acts 8: 22-
24). (3) It affords a test for all priests who claim to pardon sin, If they possessed
power to forgive sins
they would have power also to relieve the body of the physical consequences of
sin.

11 And he said unto them, Unto* you it is given
to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but
unto them that are without,” all these things are
done in parables:
12 That® seeing they may see, and not perceive;
and hearing they may hear, and not understand;
lest at any time they should be converted, and their
sins should be forgiven them.
13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this par-
able? and how then will ye know all parables?
14 § The sower® soweth the word.
15 And these are they by the way-side, where the
word is sown; but, when they have heard, Satan
cometh® immediately, and taketh away* the word
that was sown in their hearts.
16 And these are they likewise which are sown on
stony ground; who, when they have heard the word,
immediately receive it with gladness;
17 And have no root’ in themselves, and so en-
dure but" for atime: afterward, when afiliction or
persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immedi-
ately! they are offended.
18 And
these are they which are sown
among
thorns; such as hear the word,
19 And the! cares of this world, and the deceit-
fulness* of riches, and the! lusts of other things
entering in, choke the word, and it becometh un-
fruitful.”
20 And these are they which are sown on good
ground; such as hear the word, and receive z¢, and
bring forth fruit," some thirty-fold, some sixty, and
some an hundred.
21 7 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought
to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not
to be set on a candlestick?
22 For® there is nothing hid, which shall not be
manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but
that it should come abroad.
23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

And he i1
said unto them, Unto you

bles: that seeing they may 12

cometh Satan, and taketh
away the word which hath
been sown in them. And i6
these in like manner are
they that are sown upon
the rocky
places, who, .
when they have heard the
word, straightway receive
it with joy; and they have 17
no root in themselves, but
endure for a while; then,
when tribulation or perse-
cution ariseth because of
the word, straightway they
stumble, And others are 18
they that are sown among
the thorns; these are they
that have heard the word,
and the cares of the world, 19
and the deceitfulness of
riches, and the lusts of
other things entering in,
choke the word, and it be-
cometh unfruitful.
And 20
those are they that were
sown
upon

ground; such as hear the
word, and accept it, and
bear fruit, thirtyfold, and
sixtyfold, and a hundred-
fold.
And he said unto them, 21

there is nothing hid, save

48. That no man should knowit.
That is, that it should not be published abroad. It was often
needful for Jesus to restrain the fame of his miracles for various reasons, one of which was the wrath they
excited in the Jewish authorities.
It was needful for him to delay exciting them to the point of putting
him to death till his time had come,
There are three cases, besides his own resurrection, of Christ raising the dead. This case is immediately
after death; another, that of the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7: 11-15), at least twenty-four hours after
death; the third, that of Lazarus (John, chapter 11), several days after death, when corruption would nat-
‘ urally have begun; in one case privately; in the second, publicly; in the third, before bitter enemies.

Matthew states the reason:
It was not from want of power, but of the conditions that he required. Those in need of help must either
have faith enough to seek his help, or their friends must have faith. As faith is the condition of the sal-
vation of the soul, so Christ required it as a condition of the salvation of the body from disease or death.

northwest direction, and touch at Bethsaida, take into the boat Jesus, who would go there by land, and
then sail southwest to Capernaum. The ruins of a Bethsaida are found near where the Jordan empties

10 For Moses said, Honour* thy father and thy

him die the death:
11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or
mother, /é is Corban,° that is to say, a gift, by

15 There is nothing from without a man, that

which come out of him, those are they that defile
‘the man.
16 If any® man have ears to hear, let him hear.
17 And whent he was entered into the house from
the people, his disciples asked him concerning the
parable.
18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without
understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that what-
soever thing from without entereth into the man, 7
cannot defile him;
19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but®
into the belly, and goeth out into the draught,

20 And he said, That which cometh out of the
man, that defileth the man.
21 For from® within, out of the heart of men,
proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,

Why could we not cast him out? His answer first was, according to Matthew (17320),
“Because of your unbelief.’? The whole difficulty centered in their want of faith. No demon could defy
them if only they had faith enough. And then Jesus illustrates the power of faith by showing that even
asmallamount of active, living faith, like a yrain of mustard-seed, could remove ‘this mountain,” per-
haps pointing to Mount Hermon, at whose base they were, and which towered in its grandeur above them.
Can come forth by nothing, but by prayer.
(fasting is omitted in the New Version, but placed in
the margin.) The faith which will be effectual must be a faith exercised in prayer. The work of the
Church is still to cast out devils, the unclean spirits of worldliness, selfishness, greed, infidelity, lust,
intemperance, Sabbath-breaking.
‘These still defy the ordinary efforts and faith of God’s people. We
have faith enough for ordinary duties, for some giving, for prayer-meetings, for building churches; but
there is a work which ordinary faith cannot do. How shall we get that higher faith?

88. John answered him, we saw one. The disciples had shortly before returned to Christ from
their first missionary tour, in which they were empowered to cast out devils (Matt. 10:8). The man here
referred to they probably met during this tour. He must have been a disciple of Christ, who was enabled
by his faith, yet without a commission, to cure the possessed.—Abbdott. Casting out devils in thy
name.
Really, and notin a wrong spirit, as did the Jewish exorcists (Acts 19: 18, 14); for it was done in
thy name.
Such workers as this man believed in him, or they would not have used hisname.
He fol-
loweth not us. Did not join himself to the apostles as one of their followers.
89. Forbid him not. He neither praises nor blames him for following an independent course, and
not working with his disciples. He simply declares that he must not be forbidden, and that those who
work the same kind of work that we do should be regarded, not as enemies, but allies. Thousands, in
every period of church history, have spent their lives in copying John's mistake. They have labored to
stop every man who will not work for Christ in their way from working for Christ at all.—Ryle.

his question, ‘tempting him;” that is, “testing him,” Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.
This commendation, not given. by Matthew, is given because the scribe had declared that outward obedi-
ence amounted to nothing unless the heart was right. Pharisaism consisted of forms and paid little atten-
tion to love, mercy and purity of heart. Alford says: ‘*This man had hold of that principle in which law
and gospel are one. He stood, as it were, at the door of the kingdom of God. He only wanted (but the
want was indeed a serious one) repentance and faith to be within it. The Lord shows us here, that even
outside his flock, those who can answer discreetly, who have knowledge of the spirit of the great com-
mand of {aw and gospel, are nearer to being of his flock than the formalists; but then, as Bengel adds, ‘If

42. There came acertain poor widow.
Here, as in other places in the Bible, we must remember
the exceedingly depressed and dependent condition of a poor man’s
widow in the countries where our
Lord was. The expression is almost proverbial for one
very badly off, and most unlikely to contribute
anything to a charitable purpose. Two mites.
The smallest of Jewish
coins, about the value of one-
fifth of acent. It took its name from its extreme smallness, being
derived from an adjective signifying
thin. A farthing. Mark (not Luke) adds for his Roman readers
an explanation, using a Greek word
(taken from the Latin), meaning the fourth part, as our word
“farthing” does. The value is only of
importance as showing upon how minute a gift our Lord pronounc
ed this splendid panegyric, which
might be envied by a Creesus or a Rothschild.
43. Cast more in than all. Note the word more—proportionately,
to-wit, to her means, and thus
more in the estimation of God, who measures quantity by quality.
44. For. The worth of a giftis to be determined, not by intrinsic
value, but by what it costs the giver.
The measure of that cost is what is deft, not what is given.
For the widow to give her mites was noble; for
one well off
to give “his mite’’ is contemptible. All that she had, all her
living. Out of her want,
out of her destitution, she has cast in all that (in cash) she
possessed—her whole (present) means of sub-
sistence. In love she devoted all to God, with strong faith in his
providential care.

CHAPTER
1 After two days was the feast of the passover,
and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and
the scribes sought how they might take him by
craft, and put zm to death.
2 But they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there
be an uproar of the people.
3 { And° being in Bethany, in the house of
Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a
woman, having an alabaster-box of ointment of
spikenard, very precious; and she brake the box,
and poured z¢ on his head.
4 And there were some that had indignation
within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of
the ointment made?
5 For it might have been sold for more than three
hundred pence, and have been given to the poor.
And they murniured against her.

Now after two days was
the feast of the passover
and the unleayened bread:
and the chief priests and
the scribes sought how they
might take him with subtil-
ty, and kill him: for they
said, Not during the feast,
lest haply there shall be a
tumult of the people.
And while he was
in
Bethany in the house of Si-
mon the leper, as he sat at
meat, there came a woman
having an alabaster cruse
of ointment of spikenard
very costly; azd she brake
the cruse, and poured it
over his head. But there
were some that had indig-
nation among themselves,
saying, To what purpose
hath this waste of the oint-
ment been made? For this
ointment might have been
sold for above three hun-
dred pence, and given to
the poor.

when he would return again to judgment. If he voluntarily knew not, what folly for theologians to fix
upon the time.
87. Watch.
Observe in this chapter the emphasis given to Christ’s exhortation, ‘‘ Watch!”” Matthew
tells us how the Lord sought to impress these lessons of watchfulness and faithfulness still more deeply
by the parables of the “Ten Virgins’’ (Matt. 25: 1-13), and the “Talents” (Matt. 25: 14-30), and closed all
with a picture of the awful day when the Son of man should separate all nations one from another, as the
shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats (Matt. 25: 31-46).
1-9. After two days was the feast of the passover.
See notes on Matt. 26: 1-16. Compare
John 12: 1-8. The action of the Sanhedrim was taken on Wednesday, the Anointing took place the Satur-
day before, and is brought up here on account of its connection with the bargain Judas made with the
_chief priests.

MARK.
_ 5 And, entering into the sepulchre, they saw a
young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a
long white garment; and they were affrighted.
6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted. Ye

he is
risen;*he is not here: behold the place where they
laid him.
7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter
that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall
ye see him, as he said unto you.
8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the
sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed:
neither said they anything to any man; for they
were afraid.

of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene,
out of whom he had cast seven devils.

Matthew calls him an angel. Luke says that
there were two who ‘‘stood;”’ z. e., appeared suddenly. Besides, they might easily have both sat and stood
during the interview; might have both been both outside and inside at different moments, and they might
have been seen both singly and together in the sudden and shifting apparition.—Jacobus.
6. He is risen. Through woman death was first introduced into the world; to woman the first
announcement was made of the resurrection.
7. Tell his disciples and Peter. Observe that as Christ’s first appearance is to Mary Magdalene
(John 20: 18), out of whom he had cast seven devils, so his special message is to Peter, who had denied
him. A touching commentary on our Savior’s saying that he came to saye sinners.

The remainder of the chapter is not found in the Vatican or
Siniatic Greek MSS., but is found in the Alexandrian. These are the three oldest and most reliable MSS.
Some hold these verses to be a later addition, but as they are found in all the most ancient versions they
must have been a part of Mark’s Gospel when the first century ended. Schaff, Plumtre, Olshausen, Loch-
man and others regard them genuine, while other critics consider them doubtful. A circumstance in their
favor is that the Vatican MS. has a vacant space for them. It seems probable that in an early copy, there-
fore, they were omitted for some cause by a copyist who left space for them, but did not afterwards fill it,
and that the Siniatic MS. was made from the mutilated copy. It is clear that verse 8 was not designed to.

This appearance is described

Preach the gospel. The good news of salvation through Christ; the way of life. To every creature.
To every mortal. None are denied the Savior if they will have him.
16. He that believeth. Believeth the gospel message; believes in Christ as his Savior. And is

one has not faith enough in Christ to obey him he has not faith enough to be saved. He that believeth
not. Remains in a state of unbelief. Such have no promise. See John 3: 18.
17. These signs shall follow them that believe. It is generally held that this is a promise lim-
ited to the apostolic age and toa few of the disciples of that age. Perhaps the plural them does not have
for its antecedent the singular he in verse 16, but the plural them in verse 14. If it does not, why is the
number changed in verses 15 and 16?
The grammatical construction requires us to look to verse 14 for the
antecedent of them in verse 17. In verse 14 the apostles are ‘‘upbraided for their unbelief because they
believed not them who had seen him after he had arisen.” They are commanded to go and tell the glad
story, and assured that miraculous credentials shall be given to those of ‘‘them who believe”’ and tell the
wonderful tidings.

20. They went forth and preached everywhere.
Acts of the Apostles is the history of their
preaching. It should be studied to see how the Apostles understood and preached the Commission of the
Lord. The Commission of Christ is to his Church; its field is the world; its work is to preach the gospel;
its congregation embraces every creature; its offer is a free and full salvation; the conditions of salvation
are faith in Christ, and obedience to him; the consequence of rejecting Christ’s salvation is eternal con-
demnation,
:INTRODUCTION
TO LUKE.
Tur TutrD GosPEL is assigned by the common voice of the primitive Church to
Luke, ‘‘the beloved physician,” and companion of Paul. Of his earlier history noth-
ing is recorded.
There is no proof that he ever saw the Lord or that he became a
believer until some time after his death. He was not a Jew, his name is Greek, his
style and modes of thought point to Greek training, and it has been generally
believed that he was one of ‘‘the Grecians who turned to the Lord” in the great
commercial city of Antioch, where the first Gentile church beyond Palestine was
founded. From the incidental references to himself in the Acts we learn that he was
the constant companion of the later ministry of the great apostle to the Gentiles, and
this is confirmed by the allusions to him in the Epistles. From Col. 4: 14, Philem. 24,
and 2 Tim. 4:11, we learn that he was a Gentile, a physician, that he remained with
Paul in his imprisonment at Cesarea and attended him to Rome, where he was his
companion during his long sufferings.
Tur GosPEL of Luke differs from the other three in its sources of information.
Matthew wrote as an eye witness; Mark probably recalled the recollections of Peter;
John recalled his own personal memories of the life and words of the Lord, but Luke
draws from the authentic sources of information then accessible and carefully

Christ brings to light by bringing into

Zacharias in the wilder-

of repentance unto remis-

in the book of the words of
Isaiah the prophet,
The voice of one crying
in the wilderness,
Make ye ready the way
of the Lord,
Make his paths straight.
Every
valley
shall
be 5
filled,
And every mountain and
hill shall be brought
low;
And the crooked shall
become straight,
And
the rough
ways
smooth;
And all flesh shall see the 6
salvation of God.
He said therefore to the 7
multitudes that went out to
be baptized of him, Ye off-
spring of vipers, who warn-
ed you to flee from the
wrathtocome?
Bringforth 8
therefore fruits worthy of
repentance, and begin not
to say within yourselves,
We have Abraham to our
father: for lL say unto you,
that God is able of these
stones to raise up children
unto Abraham.

none of them was cleansed,

things; and they rose up, 2%
and cast him forth out of

the brow of the hill where-
on their city was built, that
they mightthrow him down

22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he,
answering, said unto them, What reason ye in your
hearts?
23 Whether is easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven
thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?
24 But that ye may know that the Son of man
hath

upon

unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise,

one of those days, that he
was teaching; and there
were Pharisees and doctors

went up to the housetop,
and let him down through

said, Man, thy sins are for-

10 § And the apostles, when they were returned,
told him all that they had done. And he took
them, and went aside privately into a desert place
belonging to the city, called Bethsaida.
_ 11 And the people, when they knew* Zt, followed
him: and he received them, and spake unto them
of the kingdom” of God, and healed them that had
need of healing.
12 § And* when the day began to wear away,
then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the
multitude away, that they may go into the towns
and country round about, and lodge, and get
victuals: for we are here in a desert® place.
13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
And they said, We have no more but five loaves and
two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for
all this people.
14 (For they were
about five thousand
men.)
And he said to his disciples, Maket them sit down
by fifties in a company.
15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.
16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes,
and, looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and
brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the
multitude.
17 And they did eat, and were all filled; and
there was taken up of fragments that remained to
them twelve baskets.

prophets is risen again.

us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles;
one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias:
not knowing! what he said.
34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud and
overshadowed them: and they feared as they en-
tered into the cloud.
35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, say-

alone. And they kept 7é close, and told no man in
those days! any of those things which they had seen.

A Jewof Jerusalem. Went down. It was a constant descent from Jeru-
salem to Jericho, over 3,000 feet in eighteen miles. Fell among robbers. The road is a dark, desolate,
mountain pass, dangerous then, so beset by robbers still that no traveler dares go through it withouta
guard. Which stripped him. Not only of raiment, but of all he had; then left him, stunned, bleeding,
unconscious, nearly dead. A certain priest. Jericho was a city of priests. <A priest ought to be a holy
man. The law commanded mercy and help to a neighbor (Exod. 23: 4, 5; Deut. 22: 1-4). The priest and
Levite both disregarded the law in passing by the poor sufferer. Likewise a Levite. A temple minis-
ter. He probably excused himself by the example of his priest. A certain Samaritan.
The heredi-
tary enemy of the Jews; despised and hated by the latter. ‘‘The Jews and Samaritans have no dealings”
(John 4:9). If any man had excuse for passing the wounded Jew by it was the Samaritan.
But he,
unlike the priest and Levite, had compassion.
His compassion leads to action, to self-denial, and
inconvenience.
He dresses the man’s wounds, sets him on His own beast, carries him to the inn, and
when he left, left money for his care. For ancient inns, see note on Luke2:%. Two pence was two

This is one of the passages that show the great
impression produced at that time by Christ’s teaching. See also Mark 1: 33; 2:2; 3:9; 6:31, etc. The dis-
course that follows is found almost verbatim in Matthew. Beware of the leaven. The spirit of the
Pharisees. There is great danger of religion becoming formal and hypocritical. See note on Matt. 16: 6.
There is nothing covered. For notes on verses 2-5 see Matt. 10: 26-28. The flat tops of Eastern houses
were the places from whence public proclamations were made.

the Rich Fool that follows, are only foundin Luke. Speak to my brother. This man wished to enlist
Christ’s moral power for his pecuniary advantage. Whether his brother had wronged him or not is not
stated, but the Lord’s business was not to gain acres of land and money for men, and hence he replies:

‘third day, in a short time, I am perfected. By the suffering at Jerusalem. See Heb, 2:10. In other

2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, say-

3 { And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep,
if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety
and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which
is lost, until he find it?
5 ‘And when he hath found 7, he layeth 7 on his
shoulders, rejoicing.
6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together

joice with me; for I have found my sheep" which

‘*Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness (riches), that when it shall] fail
(when you can use it no longer), they shall receive you into the eternal tabernacles” (heaven). It is
strange that there is any difficulty over this passage, as translated clearly in the Revised Version. The
only friends who can receive usinto heaven are the Father and the Son, These are, then, the friends we
must secure. During life our means must be so used as to please God and to lay up eternal treasure. If
we use it as a trust of the Lord we will secure such a friend. Instead of hoarding we must make heavenly
friends.

That which belongs to God, All who have property should

The Rich Man and the Beggar (verses 19-31). A parable, also, showing the consequences of a worldly
spirit and the worldly use of wealth. ‘‘ Here, asin other cognate parables, great wisdom is displayed in
bringing the whole force of the rebuke to bear on one point. Itis not intimated that this man made free
with other people’s money, or that he had gained his fortune in a dishonest way. All other charges are
removed, that the weight lying all on one point may more effectively imprint the intended lesson. To have
represented him as dishonest, or drunken, would have blunted the weapon’s edge. Here is an affluent
citizen, on whose fair fame the breath of scandal can fix no blot. He had a large portion in this world,
and did not seek—did not desire—any other. He spent his wealth in pleasing himself, and did not lay it
out in serving God or helping man.’’—A7not.

Acertain rich man.
Not one whom the world would call @ great sinner, but eminently respect-
able; one whom the worldly would admire, while the poor man was one whom the covetous would despise.
Clothed in purple.
The purple was anciently the royal color, the gorgeous hue of the imperial robes,
and hence the very term, the purple, is still used to signify the royal dignity. And fine linen. The
finest apparel. Faring sumptuously every day. Enjoying not only the most sumptuous fare on the
table every day, but every sensual enjoyment.
How the world would admire his lot in life!
20. Acertain beggar. Beggary, such as is here depicted, is much more common in the East than
with us, and, in the absence of any more systematic provision, alms-giving to the poor was insisted upon
by the Old Testament (Job 29: 13; Psa. 41:1; 112: 9; Prov. 14:31). Named Lazarus.

avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary

saith.

cry day and night unto him, though he bear long
with them?

9 | And he spake this parable unto certain which®
trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and
despised others:
10 Two men went up into the temple to pray;
the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
11 The Pharisee stood’and prayed thus with him-
and not to faint; saying, 2
There was in a city a judge,
which feared not God, and
regarded not man:
and 3
there was a widow in that
city; and she came oft unto
him, saying, Avenge me of
mine adversary. And he 4
would not fora while: but
afterward he said within
himself, Though I fear not
God, nor regard man; yet 5
because this widow troub-
leth me, I will avenge her,

1. He entered and was passing through Jericho. He had crossed the Jordan at the ford
beyond Jericho, and the road from thence to Jerusalem led through Jericho, ‘the city of palm trees,” the
chief city of all eastern Judea. It stood at the mouth of the gap in the mountain rampart, through which
the road ascended to Jerusalem, more than 3,000 feet above the plain of Jericho.

6. He received him joyfully. He did not expect such an honor as that the Great Teacher would
stop with one of a class so despised by the Jews as his own.
7. They all murmured.
How often these complaints of Jesus stooping down to the company of
sinners are recorded! Now, however, the crowd expected that at Jerusalem his kingdom would be pro- .
claimed, but here he is the guest of the chief agent of the oppressive Roman tribute! Had Christ sought
popularity he would never have gone with Zacchezus.

doubt the Lord had preached tohim.

that when he reached Jerusalem “his kingdom would immediately appear;” an earthly kingdom like that
‘of David. The parable that follows was spoken, in part, to correct that idea.
12. A certain nobleman went into a far country.
While this parable is much like that of
the Talents (Matt, 25: 14-30 and Mark 13: 34-36), it is a different one in many particulars; spoken elsewhere;
for a different purpose. To receive for himself a kingdom.
As Christ would leave the earth and
ascend to heaven before he would receive his kingdom.

32 Last of all the woman died also.
33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of
them is she? for seven had her to wife.
34 And Jesus answering, said unto them, The

Supper was eaten (Matt. 26: 21)., It seems probable, from John 13: 21-85, that Judas left before the supper.
‘On this passage, see notes on Matt. 26: 21-25.

There arose a contention among them.
This contention probably arose while they were
taking seats for the paschal meal, each seeking the chief place. It was rebuked by the Lord washing
their feet (John 13: 38-5). See notes on Matt. 18: 1-4. Benefactors.
This very title has often been con-
ferred on Gentile rulers, as Ptolemy Huergetes, ‘‘Ptolemy, the Benefactor,” one of the kings of Egypt.
Ye shall not be so. Greatness shall be sought by serving. He is greatest who serves the world best.
I appoint unto you a kingdom.
A kingdom to be secured, not by conquering and ruling,
but humility, self-denial, and service. ‘‘He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” Thus shall the
apostles be entitled to eat at the Lord’s table in the kingdom, and to sit on thrones, ete. They attained
these thrones, but they are spiritual, rather than temporal.

followed him from Galilee, stood afar® off, behold-

50 ¥ And, behold, there was
aman named Joseph,
a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
51 (The same had not consented to the counsel
and deed of them:) he was of Arimathea, a city of
the Jews; who" also himself waited for the kingdom
of God.
52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the
body of Jesus.
53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen,
and laid it in a! sepulchre that was hewn in stone,
wherein never man before was laid.
54 And that day was the! preparation,

Jesus had eried with a
loud voice, he said, Father,

Jesus Christ. In less than a hundred years after his death Christian writers living in
different quarters of the world, whose writings are still extant, show us that this was
the universal belief of the church. Indeed, the testimony to the authorship is stronger
than can be furnished that Josephus wrote his Jewish history, that Cxsar wrote his
Commentaries, or in behalf of any uninspired writing of antiquity, and would never
have been questioned had not a class of rationalistic critics arisen who wished to set
aside the lofty views of the personality and mission of the Savior which are so promi-
nent a feature of the Fourth Gospel. We know from John 21: 24, that it was written
by an eye-witness and by a beloved disciple. There were only three disciples who
were admitted to the most intimate relations with Jesus—Peter, James and John.
As it was not written by either of the first two, John must be the author. So the
early church unanimously testifies. Irenzeus, who learned of one who had been inti-
mate with John and who wrote near the.middle of the second century, affirms that he
was the author. Itis credited to John in the canon of Muratori, the first catalogue of
the New Testament writings, written A. D. 175. It is also spoken of by Theophilus of
Antioch A. D. 175, and by Clement of Alexandria, near the same time, and in the
latter part of the second century it was translated into the Syraic and Latin versions
of the New Testament. Besides these direct recognitions there are evident allusions
to it and quotations from it in a number of epistles and treatises of Ignatius, Hermas,
Polycarp, Papias, and others, which belong to the first half of the second century.
:
Indeed, it is quoted within twenty years of John’s death.
PLACE AND Time. We do not know certainly when or where the Fourth Gospel
was written. Ireneus, who lived in the second century, and who was the religious
pupil of Polyearp, the martyr who was educated at the feet of John, declares that it
was written at Ephesus, after the other three had been written. Its internal character
indicates that it was written outside of Judea, after the fall of the temple, and after
certain heresies began to be developed. John was still at Jerusalem A. D. 50 (Gal.
chapter 2); itis almost certain that he did not go to Ephesus until after the death of
Paul, about A. D. 67, and it is probable that he did not leave the city of Jerusalem,
permanently, until the storm of destruction began to gather, which broke in A. D. 70.
‘As the testimony of the early church is unanimous that his later years were passed at
Ephesus and in that region, he probably went there about this date. After this, and
before his death, which took place near the close of the century, the Gospel was
written.

people were better educated than those of any other country in the world.
Jesus found John among the disciples of John the Baptist, who at once pointed him
and his companions to Christ. We next meet him at the sea of Galilee, fishing, and
there Jesus gave hima permanent call. From this time onward he steadfastly fol-
lowed the Master, and with James and Peter, formed an inner circle nearer the Lord.
These three, only, witness the resurrection of Jairus’ daughter, see the glory of the
transfiguration, and the agony of the garden. John and Peter follow Christ, after his
arrest, and the first goes openly into the house of Caiaphas, to the trial before Pilate,
and to the cross, till all was over. When the news of the resurrection came he and
Peter were first to reach the sepulchre. To him Jesus committed the care of his own
mother, while dying on the cross, and it is probable that he remained in Judea to
attend to this sacred charge while she lived. From about the time of the overthrow
of Jerusalem he changed his residence to Ephesus, where he probably lived until he
died, near the close of the first century. The testimony of the early church would
place his death after A. D. 98. It was during this later period that he wrote his
Gospel, his Epistles, was exiled to Patmos, and there wrote his Revelation.
Tue Cuaracter of John’s Gospel, written after all his fellow apostles had gone to
rest, differs in some respects from the others. It alone follows the chronological
order of events, gives an account of the Judean ministry of our Lord, shows that his
ministry lasted for over three years, gives the account of the resurrection of Lazarus
and of the wonderful discourse to the disciples the night that he was betrayed. It
omits much with which the church was already familiar through the other Gospels,
presents much that they had not recorded, and recognizes certain false doctrines
which had begun to be taught. It is the gospel of the Incarnation, of Love, and the
most Spiritual of the Gospels. It alone unfolds fully the great doctrine of the Com-
forter. The great end, however, that the writer had before him in all he wrote is
givenin hisown words: These are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, and that believing you might have life through his name.THE

The first fourteen verses are introductory.
In order
to set at rest all controversy concerning the Divine nature of Jesus, John glances, in the first three verses,
back to the beginning, recorded in Genesis, and affirms:
(1) That he who was afterwards manifest as the
Christ existed before creation began; (2) that he was present with God; (8) that he was divine; (4) that he
was the Word; (5) that by or through him were all things made that were made (verse 3). The first chapter
of Genesis helps us to understand its meaning. God said, ‘Let there be light,” “Tet there be a firma-
ment,” “Let the earth bring forth,” ete., and it was done. God exhibits his creative power through the
Word, and also manifests his will through the Word. There are mysteries belonging to the divine nature
and to the relation between the Son and the Father that we have to wait for eternity to solve. They are
too deep for human solution, but this is clear: that God creates and speaks to man through the Word. As
we clothe our thoughts in words, God reveals his will by the Word, and when that Word is clothed in flesh,
as the Teacher of men, we recognize it as Jesus Christ.

His light chases away the darkness

wrote, the darkness
did not receive it. Men, in darkness, had eyes and saw not. All history demonstrates that Christ is the
Light of the World; every redeemed soul recognizes the fact.
6-8. There was aman sent from God. The writer now speaks of a witness to the Light, John, a
man sent from God. He was called to his work from his mother’s womb. The same came for a wit-

Revision reads, “‘There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the

Peter.
45. Philip findeth Nathanael.
As we learn from John 21: 2, Nathanael was a Galilean, his home
being at ‘Cana of Galilee.” His name only occurs in these two places. He is supposed to have been one
of the Twelve, the same one mentioned in the other Gospels as Bartholomew, which means “son of
Tolmai.”
The use of the name in John 21: 2 favors this hypothesis.
We

Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write. There was only one to whom this could refer,
‘The prophet like unto Moses,” the Messiah; and when Philip names Jesus of Nazareth, Nathanael is
at
once skeptical whether the Messiah could come out of Nazareth, an insignificant and despised place.

6. There were set there six water-pots of stone.
These water-pots were to supply water for
the washings usual at feasts (see Mark 7: 4). The Jews were regarded
ceremonially unclean if they did
‘not wash both before and after eating. See notes on Matt.
15: 2. The pots each held about twenty
gallons.

He saith, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.
‘He that had

the vines. For as what the servants put
in the water-pots was changed into wine by the operation of
the Lord, just so what the clouds pour forth
is changed into wine by the operation of the same law.”’—Augustine.

and the governor of verse 8th,

festivities,
10. Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine.
The language of the ruler is
sportive, but still he states a custom. The best wine was offered
when the appetite of the guests was

with two or three parts of water. The fermented wine, at first mild, and
then diluted with water, was only

held that these ‘‘brethren”’ were not brothers in the flesh, but kinsmen. The phrase, ‘his brethren,”
occurs nine times in the Gospels, and once in Acts. The natural interpretation is always that they were
his brothers, sons of Mary. Two places (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6: 3) mention his sisters. Had it not been for
the dogma that Mary remained a virgin, a dogma that has no foundation in the Scriptures, it would never
have been doubted that these ‘‘ brethren” and “‘sisters’’ were her children.

not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born
of the Spirit.
Most commentators have held that this means:
‘As the wind moves mysteriously, so does the Spirit, and
it breathes upon whom it will, effecting the inward change called the birth of the Spirit
arbitrarily.’ This
view I believe due to a wrong translation, sanctioned, not by Greek, but by current
theology. Let it be
noted that: (1) Exactly the same Greek term is rendered “wind” and “ Spirit’? in
this verse. It is a viola-
tion of all law that the same word should experience so radical a change of meaning
in the same sen-
tence. (2) That the word (pnewma) is not translated “wind” eisewhere, although it occurs
scores of timesin
the New Testament, but is always rendered “ Spirit.”
(8) Another word in the Greek, anemos, is usually
used to represent ‘wind.’
(4) This erroneous idea creates a confusion of figures. It makes Christ te
say: “The wind blows where it listeth; so is (not the Spirit, but) every one born of the
Spirit.” It affirms
of him who is born just what is affirmed of the wind, a thing the Savior never
did. These facts are
sufficient to show that the rendering ‘‘wind” is wrong. All we have to do is to translate
pneuma here, as
is done in the latter part of the verse and elsewhere in the New Testament.
The verse then reads: ‘The
Spirit (ynewma) breathes where it pleases and thou hearest the voice thereof, but canst not tell
whence it
comes nor whither it goes. So (by hearing its voice) is every one born of the Spirit’?
(pnewma).
The
meaning is: The Spirit breathes where it wills and you recognize its manifestation by
its voice; by the
words spoken by men of God as the Holy Spirit gives them utterance.
You cannot tell whence the Spirit
comes or whither it goes, but you can hear its voice when it does come.
So, by hearing the voice of the
Spirit, is every one born of the Spirit.
of tho Spirit.
The

birth of the Spirit is not the same thing as the gift of the Spirit.
To those who are
born the Spirit is given. ‘'Becawse ye are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
ery-
ing, Abba, Father” (Gal. 4:6). Hence, in harmony with the above view, Peter says, ‘‘Being born
again,
not by corruptible seed, but incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth
forever.”

not far from the Jordan, northeast of Samaria, with, as he says (Tent Work, p. 92), ‘the two requisites for

The question indicates still further her dawning

claimed descent. Jesus spoke of giving living water; Jacob, their great ancestor, had given this well.

Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
The water
of which he speaks is a gift which he gives to humanity. Itis not given to him, butis his own gift. His
language is always that of the Son of God. He says, “I am the life;” ‘Come to me, ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest;” ‘‘I am the bread of life;”’ ‘‘He that believeth on me shall never

His
disciples had left him alone at the well, while they went to the village of Sychar to buy food. They won-
dered that he should talk with a woman, and especially with a Samaritan woman,
It was considered by
the Jews indecorous to talk with a woman in public, and the rabbins held that to talk with such an
inferior creature was beneath the dignity of a doctor of the law. This illustrates the state from which
woman has been lifted by the Gospel.
29. Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did. He had told her some
things about her own life, and conscience had told her more. She felt that all was known to him, and
naturally exaggerates by saying, ‘‘ He told me all my life.”
82. I have meat to eat that ye know not of. ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’?’ The Lord
who could go forty days in the wilderness without food, in the exaltation of soul caused by his baptism
and the descent of the Holy Spirit, would forget the hunger of the body also, when he was pouring out the
water of life to a poor, thirsty soul.

The verb “sent” is past, and
refers to some event before the present incident. The disciples had baptized multitudes, ‘‘more than
John” (chap. 4: 1); so many that John’s disciples reported ‘tall men come unto him” (chap. 8: 26). They
had baptized these (4: 2), reaping the fruit of John’s labors.

world.

*‘nobleman”’ is Basileukos, from Basileus, a king, and implies one connected in some way with royalty.

certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of
Judea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought
him that he would come down and heal his son: for
he was at the point of death.
48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ve see signs?
and wonders, ye will not believe.
49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down
ere my child die.
50 Jesus saith unto him, Go* thy way; thy son
liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus
had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
51 And as he was now going down, his servants
met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he
began to amend.
And they said unto him, Yester-

(3) to make sure of his help he comesin person, instead of sending servants; (4) while he thought he
could heal his son, he did not comprehend that it could be done unless Jesus came to where he was; (5) he
thought it would be too late if the son died before his coming. His faith was very imperfect.
48. Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. The nobieman, in his sore dis-
tress, had some faith, caused only by the fame of the “‘signs and wonders”? wrought.
His faith was still
imperfect, far below the holy trust of the Samaritans.
He is the type of a class whose belief depended on
outward signs,
50. Go thy way; thy son liveth. These words were spoken like the Son of God. There was no
hesitation; no doubt. The manner of the Lord at once carried conviction to the heart of the sorrowing
father.
This miracle is a notable instance of our Savior not quenching the smoking flax, just as his reproof of
the Samaritan woman was of his not breaking the bruised reed. The little spark of faith in the breast of
this nobleman is lit up into a clear and enduring flame for the light and comfort of himself and his house.

2 Nowthere is at Jerusalem, by the sheep-market,
a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Beth-
esda, having five porches.
3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk,
of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of
the water.
4 For an angel went down at a certain season into
the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then
first,* after the troubling of the water, stepped in,
was made whole” of whatsoever disease he had.
5 And acertain man was there, which had an in-
firmity® thirty and eight years.
6 When Jesus saw him lie, and“ knew that he had
been now a long time in that case, he saith unto
him, Wilt thou be made whole?
7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have®
no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into
the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth
down before me.
8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise,’ take up thy bed,
and walk.
9 And immediately the man was made whole, and
took up his bed, and walked: and on* the same day
was the sabbath.

thee to carry thy bed.

Now there is in Jerusa- 2

pool, which is called in
Hebrew Bethesda, haying
five porches. In these lay 3
a multitude of them that
were sick, blind, halt, with-
ered. And a certain man 5
was there, which had been
thirty and eight years in his
infirmity. WhenJesus saw 6
him lying, and knew that
he had been now a long
time in that case, he saith
unto him, Wouldest thou

17. My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. The answer of Jesus to his accusers'goes to the
very root of the matter. The basis on which the Sabbath rested was that God had ceased his creative
labors on the seventh day.

Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness.
He may have fed a few thousands on the
day before, but what was that to the feeding of the whole host of Israel for forty years in the wilderness?
Is he as great a leader as Moses, in whose time the manna fell?
32. Moses gave you not that bread from heaven.
It was not Moses, with whom they were
disposed to compare him, who furnished the manna in the wilderness, but the Lord (Exod. 17:15).
He
still feeds the Israel of God on its way to the heayenly Canaan. My Father giveth you
the true
bread from heaven.
The true bread is for the soul instead of the body. It satisfies the soul’s hunger
and keeps it alive. The Father gives it by sending the Son, the true Bread of Life, Of the true bread the
manna was a type.
83.
The bread of God is he which
cometh down
from heaven.
He here defines the marks of
the true bread:
(1) It comes from heaven; (2) It bestows life upon the soul and sustains it; (8) Itis for
the world, not for a single race.
34. Lord, evermore give us this bread.
One carnot fail to see the resemblance to the case of the
woman of Sychar. Compare the Lord’s teachings there (John chap. 4) on the Water of Life.
85.
Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life.
They ask for this bread,
He answers, it is
here; Iam that bread. The work of God is that you receive it by believing upon him whom he hath
sent.
He that cometh to me shallnever hunger. He that cometh shall not hunger; he that believeth shall
notthirst. It is thus shown that faith is the power that brings us to Christ. We come to him by believing,
86. I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. They had asked a work
in order that they might believe, which was a confession of their unbelief, They ask for the bread of life,
but they can only partake of it by believing in him, He therefore points out the one obstacle to obtaining
what they had just asked for,
87. Allthatithe Father giveth me shallcometome.
Christ here, as elsewhere, shows that the
power is of the Father. The Jews may reject him, but all whom the Father gives, of every race, will come
tohim.
Christ is God’s gift to men, but the believers are his gift to Christ, ‘The gift of the Father must
not be understood of a predestinating decree. Here, and in other passages, when we read of God giving
his Son to his people it is the moral and spiritual state of the heart that is thought of under the werd.Ch. VI.]

recognizing the teaching of Jesus as divine, was that they were not willing to do God’s will. This spirit of
disobedience is the source of most, if not all, skepticism. Unbelief is due, not to the head, but to the
heart. He who in his heart says, ‘‘ Thy will be done, Give me light and I will walk in it,” will find that
Christ is just the teacher demanded by his soul, and that the gospel meets his soul’s want. Jesus will so
meet the wants of his soul that he will be satisfied and will know the doctrine, that it comes from him who
made the soul. The great German poet, Heine, was a scoffer until old and tortured with chronie disease.

His “lifting up”
would be the means of breaking down unbelief. We can see how this was verified. In fifty days after he
was lifted up three thousand believed in a single day, and the work of faith went on until the civilized
world acknowledged him as King.

Their proud language was false. Their nation had been in

in bondage to sin.
84. Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. According to his custom, Christ makes
no direct argument in reply, but states a truth and leaves them to apply it. The sinner is the slave of sin.

He passes by in silence their first charge; the second he shows cannot be

Master, who
did sinP
Many of our misfortunes and physical ills are brought on us either by
our own sins, or are inherited from parents and caused by their sins. The disciples ask if the blindness is
a judgment, and whose sin caused it? They were, perhaps, not aware that he was blind from birth,
8. Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents. Jesus does not affirm that they were sin-
less, but that their sins were not the cause of the calamity. We are not justified in asserting that the
sufferer isa sinner. Job, Christ, Paul, and the whole army of martyrs disproveit. But thatthe works
of God should be made manifest in him. By his miraculous cure the work of God shall be made
manifest.
It is the work of God to believe on Christ (John 6: 29), and the blindness of this man was the
occasion of faith being produced, not only in him, but others. Thus Christ shows a nobler use of suffer-
ing. ‘‘The Father chasteneth every son whom he loyeth.”
4. The night cometh, when no man can work.
The works of God are to be made manifest in
the blind man; Christ must work those works while the short day of life lasteth. His night of death was
near.

17 They say unto the blind man again, What
sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?
He said, He is a prophet.*
18 But the Jews did not believe’ concerning him,
that he had been blind, and received his sight, until
they called the parents of him that had received his
sight.
19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son,
who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now
see?
20 His parents answered them, and said, We
know that this is our son, and that he was born
blind:
21 But by what means he now seeth, we know
not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not:
he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
22 These words spake his parents, because they°
feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already,
that if any man did confess that he? was Christ, he
should be put out of the synagogue.
93 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask
him.
24 Then again called they the man that was blind,
and said unto him, Give God® the praise: we know
that this man is a sinner.
25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner
or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas
I was blind, now I see.
26 Then said they to him again, What did he to
thee? how opened he thine eyes?
27 He answered them, I have told you already,
and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear 7
again? will ye also be his disciples?
28 Then they reviled* him, and said, Thou art his
disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.
29 We know® that God spake unto Moses: as for
this fellow, we" know not from whence he is.

They say therefore 17

man
again,
What sayest thou of him

had received his sight, and 19
asked them, saying, Is this

1. He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold.
The sheepfold is a figure of the
church, the door into which is Christ. The sheepfolds of the East are large enclosures, open to the sky,
but walled around with reeds or stone or brick in order to afford a protection against robbers, wolves, and
other beasts of prey. There is a large door at which the shepherd enters with the sheep.
2. He that entereth in by the door. The one who comes in bythe door isthe shepherd. The
figure is very plain to those familiar with Eastern sheepfolds. The door is for the shepherd and the sheep,
while those who get in otherwise are robbers who seek to prey upon the sheep.
3. Tohim the porter openeth.
The gatekeeper whose business itis to guard the entranee. This
servant was furnished with arms to fight off intruders, but the shepherd he would letin. It is not certain
that Christ intended to make the porter a figure of any spiritual thing, but if so, he would represent God,
who has decided who shall enter through the door. And the sheep hear his voice. Thisis true to
the letter. The sheep in the Hast are so tame and so trained that they follow their keeper with the utmost
docility. He leads them forth from the fold just where he pleases. The Eastern shepherds lead their
flocks, while in our country we drivethem.
Hecalleth hisown sheep by name.
This corresponds
exactly with the facts of Eastern shepherd life. They give names to sheep as we do to horses, cows and
dogs. ‘‘ Passing by a flock of sheep,’”’ says Mr. Hartley, ‘‘I asked the shepherd to eall one of his sheep.
He instantly did so, and it left its pasturage and its companions, and ran to the shepherd with a prompti-
tude and signs of pleasure that I never witnessed before,”
4,5. The sheep follow him: for they know his voice. Also literally true in the East as all
travelers testify, buta stranger they will not follow, because his voice is strange. So true is it that
when a traveler has changed dress with the shepherd for an experiment, they still have followed the dis-
guised shepherd’s voice and refused to listen to the voice of a stranger in the garb of their own shepherd,
6.
This parable spake
Jesus unto them.
The Greek word rendered here ‘parable,’ is not so
rendered elsewhere. It is rather a simile.
”. Iamthe door of the sheep. Verses 1-5 speak of shepherds in general. These shepherds enter
into the fold and go out by the same door as the sheep. Christ is that door; (he Door of the sheep, the one
door for all, both sheep and shepherds. There isno other way in, for ‘‘there isno other name, under
heaven, givgn among men, whereby we must be saved.”Cho x]

and robbers.
Abbott holds that the idea is, ‘‘All
who came, not entering through the door, but claiming to be before me, having the precedence, inde-
pendent of me, are thieves and robbers.’?
Thisseems to harmonize with the context, and is probably the
Savior’s meaning.
He included the Jewish rabbis, the Greek philosophers, the pretended prophets, and
the “Infallible Pope.””
These all refuse to bow to his authority.
But the sheep did not hear them.

By meif any man enter in, he shall be saved.
Christ is at once the door, the shepherd and
the pasture. His pasture is the bread of life and the water of life,
10. The thief cometh not, but to steal. All those who enter otherwise
than by the door wish to
prey upon the flock.
11. ITamthe good shepherd. This title, applied to Jehovah in Psa. 23, and in Ezek. 34: 12, Christ
here applies to himself. The mark of the good shepherd is that he giveth his life for his sheep. In that
- unsettled country the shepherd had often to defend his flock,

on the cross; he took it up when he rose from the dead. Abbott says of the lesson in these 18 verses:
understand thislesson to bea parable with a double application. First, Christ compares the Pharisees to
shepherds, himself to the door, and declares that those only are true shepherds who enter through the
door; thatis, through Christ and his authority. All others are thieves and robbers, Then he changes the
application and declares himself the good shepherd whose praises David and Isaiah sung, and indicates
the nature of the service that he will render unto his sheep by giving for them his life.
22. Itwas
the feast of dedication. Two months after the last incidents, which occurred at
and shortly after the Feast of Tabernacles. The Feast of Dedication occurred in December, was not
divinely appointed, but was instituted by Judas Maccabeus in B, C. 164, to commemorate the purification
of the temple after it had been defiled by the Syrians. Jesus took the occasion to teach the people that
came together.
There is no proof that he observed it.

The word rendered “groaned” undoubtedly
means ‘‘ was indignant,” andis so rendered in the margin of the Revision. Jesus was deeply moved by
the grief of Mary, but the hypocritical weeping of the Jews who followed her, and who were acting
according to the rules, filled him with indignation.
85. Jesus wept. The shortest verse in the Bible and one of the most touching.
86,37. Behold how he loved him! Some of the Jews were touched by his evidence of tender
affection. Others, remembering the healing of the blind man right there at Jerusalem, asked if he could
not have saved Lazarus from death.

Their idea was that if the nation
followed Jesus there would be
rebellion against the Roman authority, and the Romans would, as a result, destroy Jerusalem, the temple,
and their ecclesiastical authority. This was done a generation later by the Romans, but what led to it was
the rejection of Christ, not his reception.

Romans come and destroy the whole nation for making Jesus King.
51,52. This spake he not of himself. He thought he spoke of himself, but without his knowl-
edge, God used the lips of the high priest for a prophecy. It ‘‘did behoove Jesus to die,” in order to save,
not that nation only, but that he should gather together in one the children of God.

Fromthatday.
From that day his death was the official deeree of the Sanhedrim.
Jesus therefore walked no more openly. -He avoided them until his “hour was come,” and
retired to Ephraim, a city sixteen miles northeast of Jerusalem on the borders of the wilderness.
55. The Jews’ passover was nigh. It was only a few weeks before the passover that he went to
Ephraim. To purify themselves. From ceremonial uncleanness. See Exod. 19: 10, 11.
56. They sought for Jesus. He was in the thoughts of all men now.
57. The chief priests and the Pharisees. The Sanhedrim had commanded that any man who
could direct them to Jesus should bring word. The hostility that began three years before, on the Lord’s
first visit after his ministry began, bad now fully ripened, and the “hour was at hand.”Ch. XII.]

18 For this cause the people also met

23 § And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour
is* come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
On the morrow a great 12
multitude that had come to
the feast, when they heard
that Jesus was coming to
Jerusalem,
took
the 13
branches of the palm trees,
and went forth to meet
him, and eried out, Ho-
sanna: Blessed ts he that
cometh in the name of the
Lord, even the King of Is-
rael.
And Jesus, haying
found a young ass, sat
thereon; as it is written,
Fear not, daughter of Zion:
behold, thy King cometh,
sitting on an ass’s colt.
These things understood
not his disciples at the first:
but when Jesus was glori-
fied, then remembered they
that thesethings were writ-
ten of him, and that they
had done these things unto
him. The multitude there- 17

when he ealled Lazarus
out of the tomb, and raised
him from the dead, bare

For this cause 18
also the multitude went
and met him, for that they

Now there were certain 20

asked him, saying, Sir, we

were filled with alarm. The city was filled with commotion (Matt. 21: 10, 11).
20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast.
Among those who came to worship were Greeks, members of the great Gentile division of the race which
embraced all that were not Jews, These were not Jews who spoke the Grecian language and lived in
Greek countries; those are called in the original Greek Hellenistoi. We find the latter in the Jerusalem
church inlarge numbers, See Acts 6:1. These who sought to visit Jesus were Hellenes, a term only used of
the Greek race. It is probable that they belonged to the large class of ‘* devout Greeks,” met everywhere,
by Paul, who were sick of heathenism and were attracted by the grand Hebrew revelation of the unity of
God. On this great national occasion they had accompanied Jews settled abroad as they returned to wor-
ship in the city of David,

This state-

wheat may remain in the granary for a thousand years and be preserved, but it is useless there. It neither
reproduces, noris food. It is when it fallsinto the ground and undergoes dissolution, that it brings forth
fruit. It is fruitful by giving itself up. So, too, Christ must give himself up. His death was needful in
order that he might impart life to the nations.
There is a lesson here for disciples who would *‘ bear much
fruit.”
25. He that loveth his life shall lose it.
He announces a principle that underlies all exaltation.
He gave his life and found eternal exaltation; the grain gives its life and lives a hundred-fold; those who
consecrate their lives, give them up for others, dedicate them to their holy work, will live eternally.

The best comment
on
this verse is to compare it with the account of the agony in the garden. Here he exclaims: Father, save
me from this hour.
There, “If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.”
Here he adds: But for
this cause came I unto this hour. There, ‘‘ Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.”” Here the
perfect resignation that follows the struggle in his soul is in the prayer, ‘‘ Father, glorify thy name.”

Something more than ordinary must haye
caused so remarkable an act. The fact that the cause has been lost sight
of, has caused many to misun-
derstand the significance, and to think the Savior was instituting a church
ceremonial, rather than giving
a deep, practical, spiritual lesson for all ages. I will endeavor to explain
the circumstances:
() The
disciples still expected the immediate manifestation of the kingdom. When
they sat down to this Supper
they felt that it was a kind of state occasion, and a strife arose among them
for precedence. Each wanted
the ‘‘chief seat at the feast.” An account of this unseemly controversy over
the old question, ‘* Who
should be greatest?” is found in Luke 22: 24-30, (2) Their sandals had been
laid off according to custom.
They sat down to the table with dry and dusty feet, but no one brought water
to wash their feet, an eastern
duty of hospitality made necessary by their hot, dusty climate. No apostle
volunteered to attend to the
office, the duty of aservant.
(8) Then, while they were filled with their ambitious, envious feelings,
and
had engaged in strife right at the Lord's table, after waiting long enough to have
it shown that no one
, would condescend to the menial, but needful duty, the Lord, full of conscious divinity,
arose, girded on
the towel, and began the office. A rebuke to their ambitious strife, far more powerful
than words could
have spoken; such a rebuke that never again do we see a hint of the old question,
‘* Who should be
greatest?” It was Christ's answer to their unseemly conduct, and a lesson to those Christians
“ who love
the pre-eminence”
for alltime. It said, ‘Let him that would be greatest become the servant of all.”
6. Lord, dost thou wash my feetP The language of Peter is that of confusion, of astonishment
and of remonstrance.
The emphasis is on the word thou,
:
8. If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Washing, with the Jews, was
a symbolical
act, signifying purification from uncleanliness, That Christ referred to more thana washing with water
was understood by Peter as is evident from his reply. Christ could only wash with blood the obedient.
10. He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet. We must seek the spiritual mean-
ing.
He who is once
cleansed by the blood of Christ only needs, after this, to come

Keeping the commandments will be the result if

16. Iwill pray the Father.
Rather, ‘“‘request.”” The Greek word is not the one used when we
are bidden to pray. The creature prays; the Son requests. He shall give you another Comforter.
The Holy Spirit; the Helper. The latter word more nearly expresses the idea of the Greek term than the
word ‘*Comforter.”
Abide with you forever.
The Lord had been with them over three years, but is
about to depart. Henceforth he will abide with them, not in person, but by the Holy Spirit that he shall
send. Through this agency he will be with his people ‘‘always.”
17. The Spirit of truth. So called, because he leads into all truth, and speaks the truth. See 17: 19;
1 Cor, 2: 4; 1 Thess. 1:5. He also bears witness of the truth. See Acts 2:4; 5:32; Heb. 2:4. Whom the
world cannot receive.

As the husbandman cuts off
the unfruitful branches of the vine, so the Father severs the unfruitful branches from his£on, Judas, an
unfruitful branch which did not have in it the life of the Vine, had just been severed and had gone forth.
Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it. The husbandman prunes and dresses the
branches in order that they may be more healthy and fruitful. The Father cleanses, purifies, frees from
sin, all who become branches of the True Vine.

If a man

The lifeless,
fruitless branches in the vineyard are lopped off and carried out, and wither and are burned. So, too, any
one who does not abide in Christ, is severed from the Vine, and they (the angels at the great day, not men

The Revision more
correctly renders, ‘‘ Wil] convict the world of sin.” Vhere are three points concerning which the world
would be convicted, concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment,
The Holy Spirit would effect these
important results through some means. If we would understand the methods we haye only to turn over
to the fulfilment of these predictions recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. In Acts2: 388, the Holy Spirit
fell upon the eleven apostles and they spoke as ‘the Spirit gave them utterance.”
The words that they
spoke were the words of the Holy Spirit. In the record of what was said by the mouth of Peter, we find
that the Spirit convicted (1) of sin, in that those who héard had rejected the Lord of life and glory; (2) of
righteousness, in that it was demonstrated by the manifestations of that hour that God had exalted the
Lord whom they had condemned to his own right hand; (8) of judgment, in that they were assured of the
“wrath to come” and warned to “‘save themselves from this untoward generation.”
9. Of sin, because they believe not on me. In naming sin, the chief of all sins is singled out.
All sin springs from unbelief. To destroy sin, the heart of man must be pierced with the sword of the
Spirit. Hence, the aim of the Spirit on Pentecost, and always, is to destroy unbelief.

to Whom the Word was Given. The Prayer, not for the World, but for
Them.
That They may be Sanctified. The Prayer for Saints in All
Ages. That They may be One, For Unity, that the World may Believe.

eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour® is come;
glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh,
that he“ should give eternal life to as many as thou
hast given him.
3 And this? is life eternal, that they might know
thee! the only? true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
thou" hast sent.
4 I‘ have glorified thee on the earth: I! have fin-

Ihave overcome the world.
In this world his disciples would be persecuted and have sorrow,
but he bids them Be of good cheer. The world can only afflict for a season; it is a conquered world;
Christ has overcome it.
1. These words spake Jesus. This prayer, so solemn and so tender, would never have been
recorded had it not been intended for our study and profit, but I approach it with a feeling that itis
almost too sacred for the usual verbal and textual criticism. Itis the overflow of the full soul of the Lord.
in devotion to the Father, a fitting close to the wonderful discourses beginning in chapter 13; offered in
the Upper Room, just before the Lord led his disciples out into the moonlit night, on the way to Geth-
semane.
This is the real Lord’s Prayer of the sacred word; the prayer of Matt. 6: 9-13, is the disciples’
prayer, taught to them by the Lord. In order te drink in its spirit, we must realize that the Lord stands at.
the foot of the eross, is about to suffer, and before the separation from his disciples and the agony and
shame of the cross, he goes to the Father in their behalf and in hisown. Father, the hour is come.
“The hour” of the great sacrifice, of the tragedy of the cross, the hour for which Christ came into the
world, had now come. Glorify thy Son. He was about to stoop to shame, Had he been left in the
tomb, the shame would haye been complete. Christ not only prays that he shall be “lifted up,” but that
he may so “ drink the cup” that the cross itself shall be a glory.
2. As thou hast given him power over all flesh. This shows how the Son is to be glorified. It
is by ‘giving him all power in heaven and earth,” and “committing all things” to him, raising him from.

the Jews, that it was expe-

And Simon Peter follow- 15
ed Jesus, and so did another
disciple. Now that disciple
was known unto the high
priest, and entered in with
Jesus into the court of the
high priest; but Peter was 16
standing at the door with-
out. So the other disciple,
which was known unto the
high priest, went out and
spake unto her that kept
the door, and brought in
Peter. The maid therefore 17
that kept the door saith
unto Peter, Art thou also

My kingdom
is not of this world.
It would be hard for Pilate to form any conception of a
kingdom not of this world, a kingdom of which the subjects did not fight with carnal weapons to defend
its king, or to extend its borders. He was a soldier and the representative of amonarch whose power
rested on the sword. But sucha kingdom was Christ’s. It was not of this world, did not spring from it,
was heavenly inits origin, and hence his servants would not fight that he should not be delivered to the
Jews. (1) Christ’s kingdom is supernatural, not of human origin. It isin the world, but not worldly.
2. It is maintained, not by carnal weapons, but by spiritual and moral means.

torn, was crowned with thorns and a purple robe thrown around him, and led out before the people.
Pilate, it is probable, hoped to arouse pity. Crucify him. The response was this savage cry. Pilate
then declared, Take ye him, etc. This is his formal acquittal of the charge of sedition and rebellion
that they had made, He had committed no crime against Roman law. Hence, if punished, it must be by
theirlaw. We havealaw.
Failing in their purpose, they now fall back on their charge of blasphemy:
“He made bimself the Son of God.” Whence art thouP This statement arouses the fear of Pilate.
He had never seen such calm dignity and majesty before. Could this prisoner be divine? When Jesus is
silent, Pilate reminds him that he has power to crucify or release. Thou couldest have no power
against me, etc. Jesus breaks the silence and at once assumes the position of Pilate’s judge. He
declares that Pilate could haye no power over himself unless it were given him. Christ submitted because
it was the Father’s will that he should drink the cup. Poor, helpless Pilate was not so great a sinner as the
Jews, who might have known better, who were filled with devilish hate, who were now forcing Pilate to the
erime, The words of Christ are really words of compassion. If thou let this man go, thou art not
Ceesar’s friend. This means that he will be accused before Cxsar’s tribunal of winking at treason.
The Cesar then on the throne was Tiberius, dark, suspicious, cruel in character. Sucha charge from the
representatives of the Jewish nation at Rome would probably prove fatal to Pilate; would certainly end
his career as a public man, The risk was too great. He would rather sacrifice an innocent man than to
sacrifice himself.
Hence he at once surrenders.
It was
the preparation
of the passover,
and
about the sixth hour. John marks the exact time when this remarkable judgment was rendered. It
was.about six o’clock in the morning, on Friday, the day of preparation for the passover. Mark says that
the crucifixion began at the third hour, nine o’clock, as the Hebrews began to count atsix, John wrote
many years later, after Jerusalem had fallen, among people who began to count at midnight, as did all the
Roman world, and he therefore used their language and called six o’clock the sixth hour, as we do, rather
than the first hour as the Hebrews did. Christ and his apostles had eaten the passoyer already. How then
could it be that that was the preparation day? Amid conflicting views, I can only give what seems to me
the best solution: (1) Itis certain that Christ ate a meal the evening before in the Upper Room which was

called a passover.
(2) Itis certain, from John 18: 28, that the Jews had not eaten the passover at that
time. (3) It seems clear to me that Christ, anxious to eat this passover (see Luke 22: 15), ate it in advance
of the usual time, in order that he, the true Paschal Lamb, ‘* Our Passover,” might be offered on the same
day that the passover was eaten. The priests hurried the trial and execution of Jesus so that they might
proceed to the preparation for the passover that evening. As the Lord’s Supper was anticipatory of the
‘suffering on the cross, so was the Lord’s last passover. The question has difficulties, but this view has
fewer than any other. We have no king but Cesar.
They had not now. They had rejected the
‘divine King, had chosen Barabbas instead, for life, and now make choice of Cesar as their king instead
-of the Lord’s Anointed. To Cesar’s tender mercies they committed themselves, and in about a generation
Cesar will trample them in the wine press of wrath. The choice they had made sealed the fate of their
city and nation.

reference to carrying out that Commission that he speaks in verse 23. It was in
order that they might pre-
sent the terms of that Commission infallibly to the world that the baptism of the Holy
Spirit was imparted,
of which there is a foreshadowing in verse 22. The great end of that Commission
was to declare to men
‘repentance and remission of sins’’ in the name of Christ. The following
facts are manifest:
(1) The
Savior gave to his apostles his Commission that they might make known his
will. (2) He bade them preach
“remission of sins.”” (8) He gave them a measure of the Holy Spirit, and
bade them wait until ‘“‘“endued
with power from on high” by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. (4) When the Holy
Spirit fell, they spoke
as it “gave them utterance” (Acts2:4).
(5) They then declared, under the influence of the Holy Spirit,
the terms on which “sins could be remitted.”
To*anxious sinners they answer, ‘“‘ Repent and be baptized,
every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ,
for the remission of sins.” Here, then, they, directed by the
Holy Spirit, “remit” and “retain” sins by declaring the terms on which
Christ will pardon, Thus, also,
they doin their preaching recorded through the Acts of the Apostles the
very thing that the Savior gave
them power to do, This power was not imparted to a hierarchy, nor to
any ecclesiastieal body, but to the
apostles, and was fulfilled by them in declaring to the world the conditions of
pardon and condemnation
’
under the Commission of our Lord.

27. Reach hither thy finger. Turning to the skeptical Thomas, he asks him to apply the

Thomas “saw” (he did

resurrection, isrecorded. Hach of the evangelists records some features that the others

The disciples knew that it was the
Lord, but there was something in his mien, his majesty, his altered appearance, that amazed them, filled
them with awe, and prevented them from asking questions that they were curious to know.
14.
The third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples.
John does not say that this
was the third appearance of Jesus, but the third time he had showed himself to the disciples, or apostles,
for that is the sense in which disciples is here, and often, used. The first time was his appearance to the
ten apostles, on the evening of the day of the resurrection (John 20: 19). The second was to the eleven
(Thomas was now present) one week later (John 20: 26).
15. Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than theseP At the close of the feast, the
Lord turned to Peter with this question, one that he repeated twice. On the night of the betrayal, when
Christ intimated that his disciples would forsake him in the trial he was about to suffer, Peter spoke up
and asserted that though all others forsook him he would never forsake him. What Christ had said
might be true of the rest, but he was so loving, faithful and true, that he would die for him. Yet before the
cock crow of the next morning he had thrice denied that he knew Jesus, even with oaths. Such was the
collapse of the confident disciple who ‘loved the Master better than these” other disciples. Since that
fall, Christ had met with Peter among the rest of the disciples, but had not referred to this subject, but
now has come the time for a restoration of Peter. Hence, he probes him with the question, ‘* Loyest thou
me better than these?” That question would at once recall to Peter his boastful claim, his awful fall, and
would pierce him to the heart. He no longer claims that he is the truest of the apostolic band, does not
even affirm confidently, but answers, ‘‘Thou knowest my heart; thou knowest that I love thee.’ Then
said the Savior, Feed my lambs.
16. Feed my sheep. A second time the Lord probes Peter with the question. Letit be noted that
he does not call him Peer, ‘‘the rock,” any longer. So frail a disciple could only be called Simon.
Then
Christ again commissions him to work, ‘‘ Feed my sheep.’’ Not only the lambs, but he may look after the
sheep of the fold, watch over the disciples of the Lord, young and old. Three times Peter had denied theCh. XXI.]

The questioning was painful, Peter was grieved, but the grief was wholesome, and Peter’s whole subse-
quent life bore proof of the discipline. His rashness was forever gone,
18. When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself. Peter had denied his Master to save his
own life. Now that he is reinstated in the old confidence and charged with the Master’s work, he is told
that he will be called on to die forit. He will be girded, not with a girdle, but with bonds, and he shall be
led where he would not, unto death.
19. By what death he should glorify God. These two verses can only be understood as declar-
ing that Peter should die the death of a martyr. John wrote after Peter’s death, and may be understood as.

thus Gie. It is asserted that Peter was crucified, a fact that is probable, as he was nota Roman citizen.

before him, he is bidden to resume the Master’s work and to follow him.

This is spoken of John, and the words have caused much
discussion. They surely convey the idea that John would remain on the earth, after the other apostles
depart, until the Lord cameonce more. He did linger long after all the other apostles were gone. It is
the testimony of church-history that he.did not die until about the close of the first century, many years
after the other apostles were at rest. He tarried; did the Lord come to him? At least sixty years after the
Lord spoke these words John was an exile on the isle of Patmos. There on the Lord’s day he writes:
“T heard a great voice,” and ‘I saw one like the Son of man,” blazing in such glory that, filled with awe,
he “fell at his feet as dead.””

=INTRODUCTION
TO THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.
Opsect.—The fifth book of the New Testament begins where the first four
have recorded the life, words and acts of our Savior from his birth to
the Cross, the tomb, the resurrection, and the Great Commission. They leave the
apostles and the nucleus of the apostolic church waiting in Jerusalem for the promise
of the Father which they must receive in order to endue them with power from on
high needed for the work of preaching the Gospel of the Risen Lord. The historian
of Acts begins with the Ascension, then portrays to us the waiting and praying
disciples, ready to begin the great work as soon as they shall receive the promised
baptism of the Holy Spirit. Then when the signal was given that all things were
ready by the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, he enters upon the
record of how the apostles and apostolic men preached the gospel under the Savior’s.
commission, how sinners were made saints, how the church was founded, and how it
was built up, nurtured and trained by the apostles. Acts is the history of apostolic
evangelization, the book of conversions, the first book of ecclesiastical history.

INTRODUCTION
TO THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES:
—_———~
TIME AND PuLacE oF Writinc.—Acts could not have been completed before the
year A. D. 68, as it is continued to the time at which Paul had closed the second year
of imprisonment at Rome, which is placed in that year, and it must have been
completed before the year 68, as it makes no mention of his death, which did not
occur later than that year. The closing chapters were no doubt written in Rome,
as Luke was there in attendance upon Paul (Col. 4:14), but it is probable that the
greater portion might have been written during the two years’ imprisonment of Paul
in Czsarea under the immediate direction of the great apostle. While the two years
of Paul at Rome were busied with epistles to the churches, and preaching the gospel
in Rome, the records are silent how his time was occupied while confined at Ceesarea.
It would be impossible for such a man as Paul to be idle, and as his friends had full
access to him, there is strong reason to believe that at this period Luke, his constant
companion, under his direction, not only prepared his Gospel, but by the aid of such
men as Philip the Evangelist, who had his home in Czesarea, and Cornelius, the first
Gentile convert, aided by the records preserved in the church at Jerusalem, prepared
the history of Acts to the period of the departure to Rome. From the apostles
themselves, no doubt, were obtained the accounts of the ascension, the preaching
and founding of the church on the day of Pentecost, the acts of Peter, the dispute
between the Hellenists and the Hebrews, the martyrdom of Stephen and of the
Apostle James. And there was also the information which he could obtain from the
Church of Cxsarea; in that city he met with Philip the Evangelist, (Acts 21: 8,) and
perhaps also with Cornelius, the devout centurion. From this source he would derive
his information concerning the evangelistic labors in Samaria, the conversion of the
Ethiopian eunuch, the visions made to Peter and Cornelius, and the particulars
connected with the death of Herod Agrippa. That portion of the history in which
Paul is the principal figure would require no other source of information than the
great apostle could furnish himself.

OF ACTS.
In the main I have followed that of Dean Howson.
The dates for the period after
Paul’s labors began are reasonably certain, and most critics are substantially agreed.
Those of the period from the Ascension to the time when Paul began his labors at
Antioch are somewhat uncertain. The Ascension and the founding of the Church on
Pentecost must, I think be placed as early as A. D. 30, and this gives a longer
interval for the events recorded in the first eleven chapters of Acts. As modified
the following are the outlines:
A. D. 30. "The Resurrection, the Ascension, the Gospel first Preached on Pentecost,
Holy Spirit Sent, the Church Founded, and the Events Embraced from Acts I. to

To this I may add that there is reason to believe that Paul was acquitted and
released in A. D. 68, preached in Spain, Greece and Asia, until A. D. 67 or 68, was
again seized at Nicopolis in Epirus, taken to Rome a second time, and put to death in
A. D. 68.

order to follow Jesus, attended his ministry, and seen him after his resurrection. He must be able to tes-
tify of all these as an eye witness.
23. They appointed two. Not the apostles, but the brethren, men who met these conditions, then
cast lots between them in order that the Lord might make the choice.
The two men named are not men-
tioned elsewhere.
24. They prayed.
That the Lord might choose between them.
A choice of men for any responsible
church work ought to be made with earnest prayer. It is likely that one of the apostles offered the prayer,
all joining in the petition.
26. The lot fell on Matthias.
Some have held that the choice of Matthias was unauthorized and
that he was never accepted as an apostle. The reasons for this view are that he is not named again, and
Paul was finally chosen as an apostle. To this it may be replied: (1) Neither are more than half the other
names in the apostolic band again mentioned, Thomas, Thaddeus and Bartholomew, for example. (2) Paul
was not an apostle to the Jews, but to the Gentiles, and hence, not one of the Twelve. (3) There is no hint
-anywhere in Acts, or elsewhere, that the selection of Matthias was not recognized. (4) In Acts 6: 2, “the
twelve” are spoken of, and he must have been one of ‘‘ the twelve,” for Paul was not yet converted. These
facts show that such speculations as those referred to above are without foundation.
1. When the day of Pentecost was fully come.
The entire period between it and the passover,
the waiting period of the disciples, was filled full. Pentecost, one of the three great annual festivals of
the Jews, lasted only one day, was
on
the fiftieth day from the morrow after the passover Sabbath (Lev.
33: 15-22). The Savior, crucified on Friday, was in the tomb on the passover Sabbath, and rose on Sunday,
the day from whence the count began. The Sunday following would be the eighth day, and the fiftieth
day would fall on Sunday, the first day of the eighth week. Hence, the ancient church observed Pente-
cost on the first day of the week. For fuller discussion, see Meyer, Howson and Milligan on this passage.
All agree that Pentecost came on Sunday. Pentecost was the feast of the grain harvest (Exod. 33: 16),
-and was also held by the Jews to be the anniversary of the giving of thelaw. They wereall

As this day, the day of the founding of the church, was to be a day of
signs and wonders, the shedding forth of the Spirit was made perceptible to all. The sound was heard,
the tongues of fire were seen, the word was spoken in many languages. It filled the house.

mighty sound. At the same time the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, their spirits baptized in the
Spirit.
3. There appeared unto them cloven tongues.
Luminous tongues sat on each of them, “ part-
ing asunder” (Revision), or ‘‘ distributing themselves”’ (margin). Meyer says that the idea is that they
parted and distributed themselves on those present. These tongues symbolized the fact that the kingdom -
now inaugurated was to conquer by the spoken word, by the sword of the Spirit.
4. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. All the disciples present. To be jilled implies that
the human spirit within was overwhelmed by, or immersed in, the Holy Spirit. The baptism of the Spirit
was not a sprinkling, but an outpouring that overwhelmed the human spirit. Began te speak.
This
was the ‘‘Beginning.”

In the languages of all
the different countries from which Jews had come up to Pentecost. Many would be unable to understand
the Hebrew dialect of Judea in that period, and, hence, they must be preached to in the tongue of their
own country if they understood.
That the gospel on this, the first day the Great Commission was ever
preached, was preached in all tongues, symbolized the fact that it is forall nations. As the Spirit
gavethem utterance.
They were not allowed to preach the Great Commission until now, in order that
every word uttered on this day might be the word of the Spirit, not of man.
The words were to be spoken
to an audience, not of those in Jerusalem only, but to our whole race in all time, in order to show how
sinners are to be saved under the gospel.

19. Iwill shew wonders in heaven.
Peter not only quotes that part of the prophecy of Joel
which was applicable to the events now transpiring, but he quotes that part also which pertains to the
calamities coming on the Jewish nation, and to the final judgment.
I understand verse 19 to apply
directly to the overthrow of Judea and Jerusalem,

See notes on Matt. 24: 29.
21. Whosoever sball call on the name of the Lord, etc. ‘l’o turn to the Lord for salvation in
his appointed way. It means far more than simply prayer. He who would call on the name of the Lord
for salvation must do more than say, “‘ Lord, Lord, open unto us.” He must hear and obey (Matt. 7: 21).
22. Hear these words,
Peter now begins to preach Christ directly to them. He boldly declares:
that they knew of his miracles, and wonders and signs. He demonstrates the Messiahship in verses 22-36;
1. By the miracles of which they were witnesses, 2. By his Resurrection, proved (1) by the prophecy of
David; (2) by the testimony of all the apostles present who were witnesses; (3) by the phenomena then
witnessed, which could be only due to his exaltation to the right hand of God,
23. Being delivered by the determinate counsel. It was the will of the Father that he should
die, and was known to the Father before his coming. See Isaiah, chapter 53. By wicked hands have:

By the hands of wicked Romans, whom they caused to crucify the Lord.
24, Because it was not possible that he should be holden. It was not possible that Jesus be
held by death, because he had life in himself, and, besides, it was the Father’s will that he should arise.

26 Therefore
did my heart rejoice, and my

in hope:
27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see cor-

28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of

29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto
you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead

30 Therefore being® a prophet, and knowing that
God had sworn” with an oath® to him, that of the
fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would
raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
31 He, seeing this before,’ spake of the resurrec-
tion of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell,
neither his flesh did see corruption.
32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof* we
all are witnesses.

Moreover my flesh also
shall dwell in hope:
Because thou wilt not 27
leave my soul in Hades,
Neither wilt thou give thy
Holy One to see corrup-
tion.
Thou madest known unto 28
me the ways of life;
Thou shalt make me full
of gladness with thy
countenance.
Brethren, I may say unto 29
you freely of the patriarch
David,that he both died and
was buried, and his tomb

. Before
Peter began to speak they did not understand the signs; but now it was
clear to them that they had
rejected and crucified the Lord. Pricked in their heart. Convicted of
their sins, and pierced with
sorrow.
They believed Peter’s affirmation; their faith revealed their sin in rejecting
Christ.
Overwhelmed
with sorrow, they ask, What shall we doP Isthere any way that such sinners can be pardoned?
88. Repent, and be baptized.
For the first time the terms of pardon under the New Covenant and
the Great Commission are given; given once for all time, and always the
same. The convicted, broken-
hearted, sorrowing sinner, believing that Jesus is Christ, is to repent
and be baptized. Repent. Not
sorrow. They already sorrowed; but a change of purpose; the
internal change which resolves to serve
the Lord. The Greek term rendered repent, means a change of mind.
The act of obedience in baptism -
isan outward expression of both faith and repentance. In the
name of Jesus Christ.
‘Upon the
name’’ (Revised Version). Upon the ground of the name. In submission
to the authority of Jesus Christ.
For the remission of sins. Thus, by complying with the conditions
just named, they shall receive
remission of sins. No man can receive pardon without faith
and repentance, nor can he without sub-
mission to the will of Christ. ‘ His (for) denotes the object of the
baptism, which is the remission of the
guilt contracted in the state before metanoia (repentance).”—Meyer.

they preached Christ to the multitudes in the

Though the early church had poured out its gifts abundantly
(2: 45), Peter had not enriched himself, and was a poor

claim to be his successors. It is related that Thomas Aquinas came
to Rome and visited InnocentIV.

he saw there, ‘*So,” said the pope
“you see, Thomas, we cannot say as did St. Peter of old, ‘Silver

Aquinas, “neither can you command, as did he, the lame

19. Repent ye therefore. The same command given onthe great occasion of Pentecost (2:38).
Repentance is not sorrow, but the fruit of sorrow (2 Cor. 7: 10). Those, on Pentecost, pierced to
the heart
were told to repent. Judas sorrowed unto death, but did not come to repentance. Repentance is
an inter-
nal change resulting, not from remorse, but from conviction of sin and godly sorrow
forit. The Greek
term means a change of mind. Itis the change of determination or will, the resolve to
turn from sin to
God, what, in religious language, is often styled ‘‘a change of heart.” And be
converted. In the
Revision, Turn again. The Greek term is not passive, but active. The command is to do some act,
not to
have something done to us. The Greek term (Zpistrepho) occurs thirty-nine times in the
New Testament
and is uniformly in the active voice. A false idea is given in the Common Version by
making it passive —
To repent, or change the heart, is the internal change wrought by faith. and this is to
be followed bya
definite act, ¢o urn. If one is on the wrong road, is convicted of this, repents of
it, the result is an act, to

This was the charge against Christ. It is likely
that, like Paul, he plainly preached that the Old Covenant had given place to the New, and that God’s
people were no longer under Moses, but under Christ.
This was perverted into blaspheming Moses.

from the call of Abraham to the Exodus.

seventy in all, were in Egypt. But the Septuagint Version, quoted almost invariably by Christ and the
apostles, as well as by Stephen here, after giving the sixty-six, adds: “And the sons of Joseph born in Egypt
were nine souls.” The nine, added to the sixty-six, make the seventy-five that Stephen gives. Why this

And were carried overintoSychem.
Jacob was buried at Hebron in the cave of Machpelah
(Gen, 50: 13), but the fathers were buried at Sychem., We are told (Josh. 24: 52) that Joseph was buried
there, and Jewish tradition always affirmed that his brethren were buried there also. Jerome, in the fourth
century, said that their tombs were still to be seen.
He lived in Palestine.
That Abraham bought for
asum of money of the sons of Emmor.
Foran account of this purchase, see Gen. 33: 19 and Josh,
24:32. The difficulty arises that it was Jacob that made the purchase instead of Abraham. Some have
supposed that Stephen, in the hurry of a rapid speech under exciting circumstances, by an oversight used
the name Abraham for Jacob; others have thought that Abraham did make the purchase first and that it
was repeated by Jacob. Neither of these views are probable. Had Stephen made a lapsus, it would have
been corrected by Luke, who wrote under Paul’s supervision (see Introduction), so as to give Stephen’s.
meaning. Itisfarmore probable that some, copyist, by oversight, first wrote “Abraham” for ‘Jacob,’
and that the MSS. that have come down to us were made from that copy. There can hardly be a doubt
that a man so learned in the Scriptures as Stephen, and making an inspired defence, said Jacob.

out their young children to the end they might not

20 In which time Moses” was born, and was ex-
ceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house
three months:
21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daugh-
ter took him up, and° nourished him for her own
son.
22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of
the Egyptians, and* was mighty in words and in
deeds.
23 And?® when he was full forty years old, it came
into his heart to visit his brethren the children of
Israel.
24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he de-
fended him, and avenged him that was oppressed,
and smote the Egyptian.
25 For he supposed his brethren would have un-
derstood how that God by his hand would deliver
them; but they understood not.
26 And the next day he shewed himself unto
them as they strove, and would have set them at
one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye
wrong one to another?

away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge

Atthat time.
Not satisfied with the blood
of Stephen, their persecutors turned their rage at once on the whole church. They were all scattered.
The meetings of the saints were for the time broken up, and the disciples generally fled from the storm,
into the country portions of Judea and the adjoining district of Samaria. The apostles, in some way not
explained, shielded from the destruction, remained, and many of the scattered brethren, residents of
Jerusalem, soon afterwards returned, while others that were foreign Jews went to other regions, carrying
the gospel.

of Christ. The scattered saints, long prepared at the feet of the apostles, went everywhere as preachers of
Christ. The blood of Stephen was the seed of the church.
5. Philip went down to the city of Samaria.
This was not Philip, the apostle, for all the
apostles remained at Jerusalem, but Philip, one of the seven (Acts 6: 5). The city of Samaria.
The
Greek does not render it certain that this was the capital named Samaria, as there is no definite article.
It is literally ‘‘a city of Samaria.”
This district (see map) lies between Judea and Galilee. Samaria and
Sychar were, at this time, two of its principal cities. It was probably one or the other of these to which
Philip went.
6-8.
The people with one accord
gave heed.
It was the miracles that, at first, fixed their atten-
tion. Observe that Philip, another of the seven, has the gift of miracles, the second recorded instance in
the church of the possession.of this power by one not an apostle. The next verse describes the nature of
his miracles, similar to those of Christ. See note on Matt. 4: 24, Also Mark 8: 11 and Luke 4: 44.

Giving out that himself was some great one. Claiming
to be more than a mere man.
10. This man is the great power of God. Unable to explain the things that he did; the Samari-
tans ascribed them to divine power manifested through Simon.
12. When they believed Philip. This verse states in the concisest manner the apostolic order of
converting men:
(1) Philip preached; (2) he preached the kingdom and name of Jesus Christ; (8) faith
came by hearing, for the Samaritans believed; (4) when they believed they were baptized. This describes
the uniform course in apostolic days. Both men and women.
Note that (1) only believers are bap-
tized, (2) that men and women are both included, but children are not named,
18. Then Simon himself believed also. There has been much needless discussion whetherCh. VIII.]

Simon was sincere. It would never have been doubted had we not been told that
later he fellinto sin. It
is best to take the Scripture in its manifest sense. He became a believer like the
rest. He was baptized
like the rest; then, like many others, at a later period, under
temptation, he fellinto sin.
Itis impossible
to believe that a man of his power and influence in Samaria would have yielded
outwardly to the gospel
and shown the deference he manifested to Philip unless he was at the time sincere.
But~he was of the
class described by the Savior when the seed of the sower fell among thorns,
14. The apostles
. . . heard.
They had remained at Jerusalem. The word reached them of
Philip’s fruitful work. Christ had directed that the gospel be carried to “Jerusalem, and
unto Judea, and
unto Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.” In this order it had been carried
to Samaria
and been received. The preacher sent there was not an apostle. He had miraculous
powers, but could
not conferthem.
It seemed needful, now that the gospel was accepted by anew people, not Jewish, that
spiritual gifts, such as had been given to the apostles on the day of Pentecost and imparted through
them
to others, should be bestowed upon this alien nation. Observe, (1) when the Jews first had the gospel on
the day of Pentecost these gifts were imparted by the descent of the Holy Spirit; (2) when the Samaritans
were converted these were imparted by the presence of the apostles; (3) when the first Gentiles were con-
verted, an apostle being present, they were imparted. There is no record of their impartation, save in or
by apostolic presence.
See Rom.1:11.
Sent unto them Peterand John.
Thisis positive proof that
Peter was nota pope, The body which sends is superior to the one sent. Heand John go at the bidding
of the whole apostolic body. This is the last mention of John in Acts.
15-17. Prayed for them.
That the Holy Spirit might fall on them. They had been born of water
and the Spirit (John 3:5), but had not received that baptism of the Spirit which conferred miraculous
powers. This was bestowed by apostolic prayer and the laying on of hands. I suppose, not on all, but on
those selected for teachers and preachers among the Samaritans.
“The prayer clearly pointed to sucha
power of the Holy Spirit as had been bestowed on Pentecost.”—Plumptree.
“Luke speaks not of the ecom-
mon grace
of the Holy Spirit, but of those singular gifts with which God would have certain endowed
at the beginning of the gospel.”—Calvin. Laid . . hands on them.
‘This was part of that mirac-
ulous supremacy of the apostles that they could not communicate to any successor.”— Whedon. This
reception of the Holy Spirit was manifest in speaking with tongues and other powers.
18,19. When Simon saw
..
. he offered them money.
Uninstructed in the lofty spirit of
the gospel, ambitious to possess this power peculiar to the apostles, he is sordid enough to offer money for
it. His sin was not that he aspired to this power, but that he sought to buy it. He had very crude concep-
tions of the spirit of Christianity. It is not stated, but it is easy to infer. that he was not one of those upon
whom the apostles had bestowed the divine gift.

The locality of the baptism is not certain. There are several
roads from Jerusalem to Gaza. The one by Hebron is through ‘‘desert’? more than the others, Eusebius
and Jerome state that the baptism occurred ata perennial stream, coming from a fountain, at Bethsur,
not far from Hebron.
Robinson places the baptism not far from Gaza, at the old site of Eglon. See.

Acertain man in Ceesarea named Cornelius.
Cwsarea, at this time the chief seaport of Pal-
estine and the Roman e¢apital, was their military headquarters.
Cornelius, a Gentile, a Roman officer, is
oue of three centurions named favorably in the New Testament, Julius (Acts 27: 1-3), the centurion at
the cross, and the centurion who built the synagogue at Capernaum (Luke 7:2). The office corresponded
to the modern captain. The Italian band. A cohort, composed of about 600 men. Many of the con-
quered races served in the Roman armies, but this cohort was made up of Italians. At the residence of
the Roman procurator would be placed a body of troops on which he could rely.
2. Adevout man.
This is stated of Gentiles in several places in Acts, and always means those who
had abandoned heathenism and turned to Jehovah, , They had not become Jews, but were trying to wor-
ship the One God.
The greater part of the first Gentile converts were made up of this class..
benevolent and a man of prayer.

well as others, and was told to kill and eat. When he answered that he had never eaten anything common
(as opposed to holy) and unclean, that is, forbidden by Moses, he was told that what God had cleansed was.
notcommon or unclean. This could only mean that the ceremonial distinctions of the law (Lev. chap. 11,
and Deut. chap. 14) were abrogated. It was at this time that the messengers from a Gentile, one of a class
with which even Peter would not eat, yet for which Christ had died, presented themselves.

the vision was to show Peter that it was the will of the Lord that he should go,

The Jews who went with Peter. They were astonished that the
Holy Spirit should fall on Gentiles. This miraculous outpouring was extraordinary,
and the cbject is
plain, viz: to convince Peter and his fellow Jews that God had accepted the Gentiles;
the same reason for
which Peter’s vision had been given. This is the only instance recorded of the Spirit
falling on unhap-
tized persons.
This exception is made to convince the Jewish Christians that uncircumcised
Gentiles
were fit subjects of baptism. Peter had to recall this fact in order to convince the church
at Jerusalem
that he had done right (11: 2,3; 15). As on Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell on Jews,
so now when Gentiles
receive the gospel they are baptized with the Holy Spirit (11: 15, 16).
4'7. Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized?
Peter’s scruples were
overcome. He was now satisfied that the gospel was for Gentiles as well as Jews.
God had made no
difference in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He asks his Jewish brethren if any man
can give a reason
why they should not be baptized. Wesley says: ‘ How easily is the question decided
if we take the word
of God for our rule. Hither men have received the Holy Spirit, or not. If they have not, then Repent,
saith God, and be baptized, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. If they have been baptized

Note that
Peter compares the outpouring on the Gentiles with that of the day of Pentecost. He calls both instances
“baptisms of the Holy Spirit.” Miraculous signs accompanied each instance. Have wea right to speak
of a baptism of the Holy Spirit without such signs? The gift of the Holy Spirit with its fruits (Gal. 5 :22,.23)
is promised to every obedient believer, but the baptism of the Holy Spirit seems to have been extraordinary
and special. Note also that Peter calls the Day of Pentecost the Beginning. The Beginning of what? Of
the preaching of the New Covenant, of the Great Commission, of the conditions of the gospel under the
reign of the exalted King and Savior, of the church of Christ on earth.

Jews), but those to whom they spoke were Greeks, Gentiles, not of Jewish blood at all, I suppose, “ devout

Barnabas was himself a Grecian Jew (Acts 4: 36), also the friend of
Saul, another Grecian Jew (Acts 9:27). He was chosen as a suitable man to go to Antioch and see
whether there had been areal work of the Lord. When he had seen that it was the grace of the Lord,
he rejoiced and gaye it Godspeed, and the work grew more and more in this great metropolis. Note that
this is the first church named outside of the bounds of Palestine. It was to become the great missionary
center for the conversion of the Gentile world.

tilesin the great city, in default of any other name that seemed appropriate. Here was the first great
Gentile church. Outsiders could see that they were not Jews nor pagans, hence they called them after
their Lord, just as the disciples of Plato were called Platonists, and those of Epicurus, Epicureans. The
designation, Christians, occurs only twice elsewhere in the New Testament (Acts 26: 283 1 Pet. 4: 16), and
in both places its use is ascribed to those out of the church; yet it was accepted as honoring the Lord.

and lasting three or four years. Food had to be imported by the benevolent persons from Egypt and
Cyprus, yet many perished.

of that new spirit that was to revolutionize the Gentile world. The Gentiles of Antioch extend their hands
to relieve the distress of the Jews of Palestine.

proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were
the days* of unleavened bread.)
4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him
in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of
soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to
bring him forth to the people.
5 Peter therefore was kept in prison; but prayer
was made without ceasing of the church unto God
for him.
6 Andwhen Herod would have brought him forth,
the same night Peter was sleeping between two sol-

They seemed to have passed at once from Perga tothe Antioch that
lay inthe interior. It must be distinguished from the Antioch of Syria (11: 22) before named. There were
several Antiochs, this one being the capital of the province of Pisidia. Vast ruins still mark its site.

:
an example of their custom.
15. Afterthe reading. In the synagogue worship the reading of the Scriptures made a very impor-
tant part. As copies of the Scriptures were very rare, this reading was necessary to convey scriptural ,
instruction to the people. They were read in course, two lessons each Sabbath, one from the five books of
Moses, the other from the other books of the Old Testament. Plumptre insists that we are enabled by two
curious coincidences to fix, with very little uncertainty, the precise Sabbath on which the mission work at
Antioch opened. The opening words of Paul refer to Deut. 1:31, and this was the lesson for the forty-
fourth Sabbath in the year, which fell in July or August; the corresponding second lesson from the
prophets being Isa. 1: 1-27, from which he also quotes. He starts, as was natural, from what the people
had just been listening to, as the text of his discourse.
The rulers of the synagogue.
The synagogue
was governed by a board of elders.

arose, according to the Greek custom. In Judea speakers sat. Among the Greeks they stood, The address
that follows, the first reported address of Paul, is worthy of study especially as an example of the charac-
ter of his preaching in the synagogue.
It begins with a short recapitulation of the glorious history of
Israel, a theme always apt to secure the favor of a Jewish audience, and when he has ascended to David,
the hero king and the pride of every Jew, he passes from him to the promised Son of David, and thus
preaches Christ. Had he begun at once with the latter, the great object of his discourse, he would have
aroused prejudice and perhaps closed their ears. It will be observed here before a Jewish audience, as
well as at Athens before a heathen audience, he first secured acommon ground with his hearers, and
upon it founded his argument forthe gospel.
Men of Israel, and ye that fear God.
There were
two classes present, Jews, and ‘‘the devout Greeks.” The latter had given up heathenism, had learned to
“ fear God,” and were anxious to learn more about him; hence were wont to attend the synagogue.

The preachers met this attitude of the Jews by boldly stating their purpose

the rest; it was-his will that they also should be sayed, but they thrust salvation from them. Nor were those
who then believed forced to believe. Grace was offered to them and they did not thrust it away.” ‘It is

Christ so often said, so might Paul, “ Thy faith hath saved thee.”
11-18. When the people saw what Paul had done. It must be
kept in mind that the people of
Lystra were heathen, that they believed in many gods, that their
legends taught them that the gods had
often come down in the form of men and interfered in human
affairs. Hence, it is not strange that when
they witnessed this miracle, unlike anything ever seen before in their city,
they exclaimed, ‘The gods are

of Lycaonia.
Paul had preached in Greek,
which was understood over all the East, but the native dialect
of the Lycaonians was different, and in that
they confer together. Called Barnabas, Jupiter. The chief of
the gods in the Greek and Roman
Pantheon, Barnabas was no doubt a more stately man than Paul, who
say: 8 that his own “ bodily presence
was contemptible,” and there was also a reason why they thought
Paul, Mercurius.
Mercury was the
“interpreter of the gods.” His Greek name, Hermes, is the origin of
our word Hermeneutics. Paul,
eloquent, persuasive, active, was thought to represent the part of Mercury.

The fickle populace was easily stirred to riot, and, led by the Jews, they seized and stoned the great apos-
tle until they supposed he was dead. This, the first bodily injury he suffered for Christ, of which we have
récord, is alluded to in2 Cor, 11: 25, where he gives some account of what he had endured. After the
stoning, his enemies dragged him out of the city as they would a carcass. When they had gone, the disci-
ples gathered around, and to their joy and surprise he rose up and came into the city. Whether he
had received a blow that rendered him unconscious and apparently dead, until he recovered from the
swoon, or whether his restoration was miraculous, cannot be surely determined.

(13: 1, 38). Exactly how long a time had been occupied in this missionary tour cannot be ascertained, but
it is almost certain that the visit to Jerusalem, recorded in Acts 11: 29, 30 and 12: 25, took place in A. D. 44,
while that mentioned in 15:2 took place in A. D. 51, there being six or seven years between. This time
was occupied with the missionary journey and the stay at Antioch. The first probably extended over
three or fouryears. They rehearsed all that God had done withthem.
They very properly made
areport to the church that had sent them forth. It wasavery cheering report. The gospel had been
planted in the great island of Cyprus, received
by the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, and extended through

Certain men which came from Judea.
This chapter records the first intimation of the great
controversy that agitated the apostolic church, and of which we find traces in many of Paul’s letters, the
question whether Christianity was merely a development and sort of culmination of Judaism, or wasa
New Dispensation that had supplanted the Old and taken its place. At first the Christians of Jerusalem
and Judea remained strict Jews, still keeping the ordinances of Moses.
The Samaritans converted by
Philip were a circumcised people. The idea of the apostles, at first, seems to have been that Gentiles
might become Christians, but must first be circumcised. It was a matter of astonishment to Peter and the
brethren that he was required to baptize the Gentile Cornelius and his friends without circumcision,
Then came the formation of the Gentile church at Antioch and the successful labors of Paul'and Barnabas.
in western Asia, This influx of the Gentiles to the church, and their acceptance on the same terms as the
old covenanted people of Jehovah, stirred those Jewish brethren of the more bigoted type to bitter oppo-
sition, and they began to send their teachers abroad with the declaration, Except ye be circumcised,
. . . yecannot besaved.
Thus they came to Antioch; thus, at a later period, they-disturbed the-
churches of Galatia and called out the Galatian letter. In order to destroy their influence, it was needful
at once to settle whether they spoke the sentiment of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, and hence Paul
and Barnabas were sent to Jay this question before the great mother church. This caused the conferenceCk. XV]

The apostles and elders came
together.
A meeting of the apostles and the elders of Jeru-
salem was called. It was in the year A. D, 51, about twenty years after the ascension of Christ. One
apostle had suffered martyrdom; eleven, ineluding Matthias, remained, though some might have been
in distant parts. James, the ‘brother of the Lord,” though not one of the Twelve, was a chief man now
in the Jerusalem church, and is often spoken of by historians as its pastor, or bishop. Though his senti-
ment decided the question this day, he has been regarded as a leader of the Judaizing Christians.

Born of a Jewish mother, but of a Greek father. The nameis Greek, and means one who fears God. Fol-

He circumcised him. Not because he thought it necessary to sal-

different. No Judaizing party made such a demand, and the act was one of pure expediency, in order to

dices of others as far as we can without the sacrifice of principle. From other passages (1 Tim. 4: 14;
2 Tim. 1: 6), we learn that, at this time probably, Timothy was ordained by the elders, and received special
gifts by the imposition of the hands of the apostle.486

This was a Roman province west of Lycao-
nia in Asia Minor, running down to the sea-coast of the Aigean Sea. Galatia lay to the north of
Lycaonia, and was entirely in the interior. It received its name from a settlement of Gauls, an offshoot of
a Gallic invasion of Greece in the third century before Christ. It became a Roman province in A. D. 26.
No record is made here of the results of this tour, but as we elsewhere learn of numerous churches in
Galatia shortly after this, we are justified in the inference that they were planted at thistime.

other work forthem. In the same way they were kept from going into Bithynia, the province on the
Black or Euxine sea, north of Galatia, and hence turned westward through Mysia to the sea-coast at
Troas. This city was about four miles from the site of ancient Troy, and was a transit harbor for those
who crossed from Asia to Macedonia, or Greece. A vision appeared.

Like Peter’s, it called him to labor in fields before unentered. A man of Macedonia.
Macedonia proper lies to the north of the 4gean Sea, within a few hours sail of Troas. This ancient
kingdom, under Philip and Alexander, had first absorbed all Greece, then conquered Persia and spread
the Grecian language and customs over all western Asia. In turn it had fallen before the Romans, and was.
now a Roman province. It had a number of large cities, but Thessalonica was the Roman eapital.

part of Macedonia.
The apostles tried to leaven the centers of influence with the Gospel. This city
had been rebuilt about 400 years before this by Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who named it
after himself. It was famous as the place of the decisive battle between Brutus and Cassius on the one
hand, and Mark Antony and Octavius, afterwards Augustus Cesar, upon the other.

In some way he manifested his presence and cheered him in his

Corinth, to which two epistles were written, but churches through Achaia, the province of which Corinth
was the capital (2 Cor. 1: 1.) He continued there a year and six months.

1. Paul having passed through the upper coasts. The mountain highlands in the interior of
Asia Minor (see 18: 23). Ephesus, on the coast, was near the sea level. Finding certain disciples.
These disciples had only been baptized with John’s baptism (verse 3), and had but an imperfect knowl-
edge of Christ. Their case presents some difficulties hard to explain, unless we had more of the facts.
They had evidently been baptized by some of John’s disciples, possibly in Asia, after the Great Commis-
sion was given, and were no doubt Jews. Some think that they were baptized by Apollos before he was
*‘instructed in the way of the Lord more perfectly’’ (18: 25, 26).
2. Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? This question is asked in order to
lead their way to a knowledge of their imperfect obedience. For their reply, see the Revision. They had
heard of the Holy Spirit; John always
spoke of Christ as one who
should bestow it, but they had heard
nothing of the scenes of Pentecost and the descent of the Spirit. It must not be forgotten that they lived
nearly a thousand miles from Jerusalem, in an age when each part of the world knew little of what trans-
pired elsewhere.
8. Unto what then were ye baptized?
This question implies that the possession of the Holy
Spirit is closely conneeted with a right baptism (compare 2: 88). The only case in which the Spirit was
received before baptism was that of Cornelius. For the reasons of this exception to the rule, see notes on
10: 44-47. The fact that these disciples ‘‘know nothing of the Holy Spirit being given,” showed that there
was something wrong about their baptism. Unto John’s baptism.
While John’s baptism differed
from that commanded in Christ’s commission, the apostles, the one hundred and twenty, and the “‘five
hundred brethren” (1 Cor. 16: 6), as far as we know, received no other. Weare to infer, therefore, that it
was valid until Christ’s baptism took its place. Why, then, were these disciples re-baptized? The only
explanation is that their baptism took place after John’s baptism had been superseded by that of Christ,
:
or after the Savior had been crucified.
4. John verily baptized. His baptism was (1) of Repentance; (2) of Faith ina coming Savior.

one of the wonders of the world. It was at this time (this was the third temple which had been built in
succession) of white marble, 425 feet long by 220 wide, with 127 columns, and of surpassing wealth and
splendor, It contained an image said to have fallen from heaven (verse 35). It was visited by thousands
of pilgrims, and a great industry grew up in making miniature representations of the temple, of wood,
goldor silver. This was the work of Demetrius and his fellow-workers. After paganism fell much of the
material of this temple was transported to Constantinople, and used in the construction of the church of

1-6. After the uproar was ceased. It had been his purpose to go into
Macedonia (19: 21), but to
Temain at Ephesus until after Pentecost (1 Cor. 16:8), and that time
(about the middle of May, A. D. 57 or
58) had probably come. Hence, having exhorted the disciples (Revision),
he departed. It was on his way
to Greece that the Second Epistle to the Corinthians was written. He speaks,
in 2 Cor. 12: i4 and 13: 1, of
coming ‘the third time” to Corinth. Hence, Hackett supposes that during
the three years at Ephesus he
made a flying visit to Corinth by sea to correct disorders in the church there.
When he had gone over
those parts.

churches,
He came into Greece. To Corinth. During the three months that he remained
in Corinth, he wrote
the greatest of all his letters, the Epistle to the Romans, The Jews laid
in wait. We have no further
details, but it was, no doubt,
a murderous plot.
To prevent it, his plans were changed, and instead
of sail-
ing to Syria he again took the route to Macedonia. There accompanie

no special order of bishops was created in the lifetime of Paul or the apostles, but he dates their origin
about the close of the first or beginning of the second century. Prof. Rothe, of Heidelberg (quoted by
Lightfoot on Philippians), supposes that after the martyrdom of Paul, Peter and James the necessity was
felt for a general supervision, and that this gave rise to the appointment of diocesan bishops. By the

Compare 1 Kings 22: 11; Isa. 20: 2,3; Jer. 13: 4-9; Ezek. 4:1,
The striking manner
of Agabus, and perhaps his statements of
the dark plots among the Jews against Paul, had such an effect that all sought, more earnestly than ever
before, to dissuade him from going on. Why should the apostle, with these certain dangers revealed, press
on rightinto the stronghold of enemies thirsting for his blood, infuriated by the accounts that came
up
from Asia and Europe of his success in converting Jews to Christ? Had not a deep sense of duty impelled
him, we may be certain that he would not have done this.
There can be no doubt that he braved the danger
in order to prevent a schism that threatened the church. False reports were circulated at J erusalem concern-
ing his teaching to Jewish Christians; the church there was filled with prejudice against him; from thence
Judaizing teachers went forth to interfere with his work. Hence, in a loving spirit, filled with that charity
that suffers all things, and carrying large offerings gathered in the Gentile churches for the poor at Jeru-
salem, he came up to disarm prejudice and show the falsehood of the stories alleged about his teachings,

all these difficulties, generously complied for the sake of peace and unity.
We cannot be certain that the
advice was just right, or that Paul did just right to comply, but these grand

the perfection of its great worthies.
Entered into the temple.
Purifying himself, he entered the temple, gave notice that the sacrifices
would be offered at a definite time, and the period of the vows be closed.
When the seven days were
almostended.
Seven days was an ordinary period of purification (Exod. 29: 87; Lev. 12:2;
13: 6; Num.
12: 14, ete.).
Concerning this advice of James and compliance of Paul, Pres. Milligan says:
‘Three different views
have been taken:
(1) That Paul in this case acted ignorantly, not being aware of the fact
that the law of
Moses was no longer binding; (2) that, like Peter (Gal. 2: 11), he acted from
fear of the Jewish brethren ny
(3) that he acted in conformity with that law of Christian benevolence which
requires us to respect eyen
the weaknesses and prejudices of our brethren, so far. as this can be done without in
any way neglecting
the requirements of the Gospel.” The third hypothesis is the best, but some explanations
are needful,
The Jewish Christians were slowly emancipated from J udaism, and they
did not reach the clear eonvie-
tion, until after the temple was destroyed, that its sacrifices were obsolete. Gentiles
were forbidden to
sacrifice to idols, but there was no such prohibition with regard to the altar of
Jehovah.
Even Paul
evidently at this time thought of the sacrifices as, like circumcision, a matter of indifference.
It was left
for the next generation to learn that the inspired writings of Paul himself lead
to the conclusion that all
the sacrifices of the temple altar pointed to the Lamb of God, and that, from the time
he was offered, they
became obsolete.Ch. Xx1)

From the Roman province called Asia, of which Ephesus was the
capital. As Paul had spent three years in that city, they knew him well. These Jews were watching Paul,
had seen him in company with Trophimus, an Ephesian Greek, and when they saw Paul in the temple
keeping the Nazarite vow, seized him and raised an outcry. Hath polluted this holy place. They
not only charge him with teaching against Judaism, but with bringing Greeks into the part of the temple
where all Gentiles were forbidden to come.
The Palestine Exploration Society found in their excavations
an inscription that must have been over the passage between the court of the Gentiles and the interior
court, where the chambers for Nazarites were, forbidding aliens to pass the balustrade on the penalty of
death. Nothing could arouse a greater outburst of fanaticism than the belief that Paul had taken Gentiles
within the sacred precincts. They took Paul, and drew him out ofthetemple.
He was, no doubt,
within in the inner courts, and was hurried without, and the gates shut, to prevent the pollution of the
sacred courts by the shedding of blood. They proposed to slay him when they had dragged him where it
could be done without profanation. They were willing to murder, but not to profane the temple. They
went about to killhim.
Had Trophimus been within, their customs might have permitted them to kill
him, but to slay Paul could only bea murder. Tidings came unto the chief captain. The com-
mander of the garrison in the castle of Antonia, overlooking the temple. The watch would see the uproar
from their elevated outlook, and the soldiers in a moment would rush down the staircase that led into the
temple area, and appear upon the scene. The fortress joined the temple wall and had two flights of stairs
leading into the temple courts. Took him, and commanded him to be bound.
The first thought of
the commander was that the man seized was some great criminal. From verse 38 we learn that he sup-
posed he was an Egyptian rebel. Hence he ordered him bound, Canst thouspeak GreekP When
Paul reached the head of the stairs, as he was carried by the soldiers into the fortress, he addressed the
officerin Greek. Surprised that he should use that language, the chief captain asked if he was not that
Egyptian.
Josephus twice mentions this notorious Egyptian, a pretended prophet, and leader of the
Sicarii, or ‘‘ Assassins.” This ‘‘Egyptian” brigand was probably illiterate and did not speak Greek. Iam

This at once filled them with fury. Amid their long sufferings from foreign oppressors, the
Jew took comfort in the thought that when his Messiah came the Gentile would be abased and the Jew
would put his feet upon his neck. Hence, nothing so stirred their passions as an intimation that Christ
would be a Savior of the Gentiles. In hisown synagogue of Nazareth, when the Lord declared the salva-
tion of the Gentiles, his townsmen sought to put him to death. We have seen the struggle in the infant
ehureh
before it would receive
Gentiles without circumcision.
At this time, the smothered fires of the
great Jewish war, that broke out a few years later, were burning in Jewish hearts. Hence, the statement
that Paul’s Christ was a Savior of the Gentiles, and had commanded him to pass by the Jews and offer sal-
vation to the Gentiles, at once produced an explosion of frantic rage.

11. The night following. Paul’s condition seemed most forlorn. He was even suspected by the
church in Jerusalem. He was a prisoner to the Romans, His own nation was thirsting for his life. He
had twice, within two days, narrowly escaped death. He needed comfort, and hence the Lord stood by
him, cheered him, and gave him encouragement concerning his future work. It no doubt was like a ray
of light, as he passed a sleepless night in his prison cell, to learn that the dear Lord had still work for him.
12-24. Certain of the Jews banded together.
Perhaps these Jews were of the bitter enemies
from Asia who had laid hands on him in the temple, They may have belonged to a wild, fanatical asso-
ciation of Jewish assassins, who, a few years later, played a prominent part, called Sicarii. The Talmud
says that those who took such a vow were released from it, if it was impossible to carry it out. Their pur-
pose was toinduce the chief priests, who were Sadducees, to have Paul appear before the Sanhedrim
the next day, and then they would murderhim,
Paul’s sister’s son heard. This is the only mention
in Acts of any of Paul’srelations. It is possible that this nephew was studying in Jerusalem, as Paul had
done many years before, and heard of the plot from those who did not know that he was in any way
related to Paul. Whether he was a Christian or not, he took pains to inform his uncle. There was no
difficulty of access, for Paul was a Roman, and would be treated with courtesy. Paul, at once, sent him toCh. XXIII.]

somewhat of him more perfectly.
21 But* do not thou yield unto them: for there
lie in wait for him of them more than forty men,
which have bound themselves with an oath, that
they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed
him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise
from thee.
22 So the chief captain then let the young man
depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that
thou hast shewed these things to me.
23 4 And he called unto him two centurions, say-
ing, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cesa-
rea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spear-
men two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
24 And provide them beasts, that they may set

day. On the morrow.
The morrow after they reached Antipatris, all returned but the horsemen.
Cesarea was now only twenty-six miles distant, and the danger was over. He asked of what province
he was.
Felix was governor of Judea under the proconsul of Syria. Had he found the prisoner to be of
some other province under that proconsul, he would probably have turned him over to its governor (com-
pare Luke 23: 6,7), but when he found he was of Cilicia, a distant part of the empire, he retained him.

After five days.
Five days after Paul departed from Jerusalem.
The Roman
usage was to
investigate a case promptly. The deep animosity of the Jews is shown by the fact that the high priest
himself came down to prosecute, attended by a delegation from the Sanhedrim (elders). A certain orator
named Tertullus.
A lawyer acquainted with the forms of Roman courts. Some have supposed that.
he was not a Jew, from his name, but itis probable that he was a Jew who had been educated in Roman
law, perhaps at Rome. The name signifies nothing. That of Paul (Paulus) wasitself Roman. The first.
three verses of the address of Tertullus are compliments to Felix, intended to secure a favorable hearing.
In the fifth verse the charges begin, the first one of which is false. A ringleader of the sect of the
Nazarenes.
This was the offence of Paul. All their hatred was due to the fact that he was the great
Christian leader. The reason why this is urged was to show that Paul preached a religion not authorized.

because this was the ery when Paul was seized (22: 28). Note that there are three charges: (1) That Paul
was the author of sedition; (2) preached an unlawful religion; (3) profaned the temple. The penalty of
the last by Jewish law was death, and the Romans usually permitted it to be enforced. Whom we took

Those who had come down from
Jerusalem affirmed that Tertullus had spoken the facts.

He had the right to reply to his accusers. The Roman law condemned no:
one unheard. Thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation.
For six orseyen years
Felix had been governor and was therefore familiar with the state of affairs in Judea. Upon this fact
Paul courteously congratulates himself. It is not more than twelve days. It would be easy for
Felix to ascertain the facts, for only twelve days had passed since he returned to Judea, after many years:
absence. Of these twelve, the first is the day Paul meets James and the elders, the second he enters upon
his vow, the seventh he is seized in the temple, the eighth tried before the Sanhedrim, the @leventh day he

In becoming a
‘Christian, he had not, therefore, as they asserted, apostatized from the faith
of his fathers. And have
hope toward God.
This hope of the resurrection, the great doctrine of Christianity, was one thai
the
law and the prophets foreshadow, and which they themselves also allow.
The Jews held this same
hope. Apart from the Sadducees, a small minority, the Jews believed in a future
life and judgment.
Hence, even in this matter, he was not preaching a new, unknown and illegal
doctrine, for Judaism was
acknowledged by Roman law. Josephus says, “The Sadducees were able to
persuade none but the rich.
The Pharisees had the multitude on their side.” Herein do I exercise
myself.
In this belief of a
resurrection. His belief was not a theory, but alife, and hence he sought
to keep his conscience pure in
the sight of God and man. Now after many yearsIcame.
Here he begins his reply to the third
charge, that of profaning the temple. He came to Jerusalem with the most
benevolent motives, to bring
alms to hisown nation.
These were the sums of money gathered in the Gentile churches for the poor
in Jerusalem.

Such as were customary at the
temple. It was while engaged in the preparations for a Nazarite offering
that he was seized. He thus
accounts for his presence in the temple. Certain Jews from Asia
found me. He states how these
Jews who raised the outcry found him engaged. He was engaged in a Jewish
rite. Who ought to have
been here. These foreign Jews were the legal accusers. The Sanhedrim was a court of trial,
and its
members present were not the accusers. The Roman custom required the accusers
to face the accused,
Let these same here say. Let those present testify if they know one thing against me,

declared before the Sanhedrim that Touching the resurrection of the dead
Iam called in ques-
tion. This was his real offence in the eyes of the high priest and his fellow Sadducees.

The whole
province of which Judea was a part was called Syria, and was ruled by a proconsul. The divisions of one
of the great proconsulships were ruled by procurators, translated ‘‘ governors.” Pontius Pilate, Felix and
Festus are examples of the latter.
Then the high priest
informed
him against Paul.
Immediately after entering upon his government, Festus went from the Roman capital of Judea to its
Jewish capital, The rulers did not lose this opportunity to prosecute Paul. Their aim was to have him
transferred from Caesarea to Jerusalem, and thus exposed to their murderous designs.
This was the real object of their request.
To kill him.
Those who will read the account of these times given by Jose-
phus, a Jew of this period, will see that such a murderous purpose is not improbable.

This was the request of the Jews.
The charges were in great part concerning

Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
Not Agrippa, but Festus had the authority in the
province, but this meeting was arranged in order that Agrippa might investigate the case and assist Festus
in formulating the charges (see 25: 26, 27) ; hence the king calls upon Paul to speak.
2,3. Ithink myselfhappy, king Agrippa.
Agrippa had been brought up in the Jewish relig-
‘ion, professed to be a steadfast Jew, was the legal guardian of the temple, and hence was well versed in all
the Jewish customs. He was therefore competent to be a judge of an accusation of treason to the religion
and law of their forefathers. Paul felt it a privilege to defend himself before*one who was prepared to

The Jews all knew that he had been educated and had lived a Pharisee, the strictest of

Tunning through all the Jewish Scriptures, was that the Messiah should come. For examples of the
promise, see aed 18; 49: 10; Deut, 18: 15-19; Isa. 9:6,7%. Paul not only believed in Moses and the530

Paul, like James (Jas. 1:1), speaks of the twelve tribes as having the same glorious hope. Since the Cap-
tivity, the tribal existence of the ten northern tribes had not been preserved, but descendants of all the
tribes were mingled in the Jewish nation. Paul was of the tribe of Benjamin, John the Baptist of Levi,
Joseph and Mary of Judah, Anna (Luke 2: 36) of the tribe of Asher. Why should it be thought
incredible with you? This ‘hope of Israel involved the resurrection of Christ. This Moses and the
prophets taught. His countrymen accepted Moses and the prophets, but denied the resurrection as a thing
incredible. It was for this hope’s sake, of a risen Redeemer, that he was called in question. There was
no doubt much said which our record does not preserve, as we have only the outlines of addresses.

Not only is this true, but critics hold that the Hebraisms are so prominent

In order that he
might be a minister and a witness. It was needful that the apostle of the Gentiles should see Christ. He
must be a witness that the Lord had risen. He was chosen for this work before conversion, because he
was honest, deeply conscientious, and possessed the great qualities that were needful to fit him for the
most important work ever assigned to man.

It is the key-note of all Paul’s ministry. Fear not. They were in the midst of terrible:
peril, in a ruined ship, on an unknown sea, tossed by the storm, surrounded by angry waves beneath, and
angry heavens above. But God had not forgotten his servant. God hath given thee all, etc. Paul

Driven up and down
in Adria.
The central basin of the Mediterranean, between Sicily
on the west and Greece on the east, was called by the old geographers “ Adria,” or the Adriatic sea.
The
name is now confined to the Gulf of Venice. The shipmen deemed that they drew near to some
country.
They probably heard the awful roar of the breakers. Sounded, and found it twenty
fathoms.
One hundred and twenty feet.
The shallowness showed that they approached a coast,
especially as it grew shallower every time the lead was cast. Fearing
rocks.
It was night, and
they could hear the sound of the breakers.
By day they might avoid the rocks. Hence they cast anchor

men were about to flee. The sailors were about to take the boat, under a false pretence, and abandon
the ship. For the safety of allit was needful that they remain, in order to manage the ship when it was
run ashore. Hence the centurion, at Paul's request, cut off the boat and let it drift away.
33-38. Paul besought them to take meat. At dawn of day. He seems to have really had charge
in this hour of peril. They needed the strength of the food for the work before them. Having taken
nothing. The thought is, that for fourteen days they had had no regular meals. This is for yourCh.

39 And when it was day, they knew not the land:

40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they

themselves unto the sea, and loosed the
rudder-bands,

Rather, “A bay with a beach,” as in
the Revision; a sloping beach. Into this they determined to try to thrust the ship, because here the force
of the waves would be broken, the water shallow, and the beach favorable for the men’s lives. Taken
up the anchors (see verse 29). The Revision says, “Cast off their anchors.” Cut the ropes and let them
go. Loosed the rudder bands. When anchored by the stern (verse 29), the rudder was lifted up out
of the water by rudder bands to keep it out of the way of the anchor cables. Now it was let down again
in order to steer the vessel. A place where two seas met. Where two bodies of water joined. This
was due to a small island-on the coast of the larger, Salmonetta on the coast of Malta. When they moved
into the bay, they did not see the inlet coming in on the other side of Salmonetta, but when they saw it,
they saw that “two seas met.” Ran the ship aground.
This was what they purposed, but the vio-
lence of the waves was such as to break the stern in pieces. The soldiers’ counsel was to kill the
prisoners.

band met them at the Three Taverns, which is ten miles nearer the great city. Both these places are

apostle traveled asa prisoner amid these strange scenes, along the crowded Appian Way, with so many
evidences of colossal power on every hand, and of such luxury and corruption, it was a glad sight to meet
a welcome from loving brethren, already numerous in Rome.

omen that the church of the capital of the world should meet and greet him. The distance traveled by
